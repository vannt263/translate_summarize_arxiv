    "<S> the excess of solar - neutrino events above 13  mev that has been recently observed by superkamiokande can be explained by the vacuum oscillation solution to the solar neutrino problem ( snp ) . if the boron neutrino flux is 20% smaller than the standard solar model ( ssm ) prediction and the chlorine signal </S>",
    "<S> is assumed 30% ( or @xmath0 ) higher than the measured one , there exists a vacuum oscillation solution to snp that reproduces both the observed spectrum of the recoil electrons , including the high energy distortion , and the other measured neutrino rates . </S>",
    "<S> the most distinct signature of this solution is a semi - annual seasonal variation of the @xmath1be neutrino flux with maximal amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> while the temporal series of the gallex and homestake signals suggest that such a seasonal variation could be present , future detectors ( borexino , lens and probably gno ) will be able to test it .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    superkamiokande  @xcite has recently observed an excess of solar - neutrino events at electron energies higher than @xmath2mev . </S>",
    "<S> this excess can not be interpreted as a distortion of the boron neutrino spectrum due to neutrino oscillations  @xcite , if one restricts oneself to those oscillation solutions that explain the observed gallium , chlorine and water - cerenkov neutrino rates .    </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to think that this excess is the result of low statistics or small systematic errors at the end of the boron neutrino spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> for example , because of very steep end of the electron spectrum , even small systematic error in electron energy ( _ e.g. _ , due to calibration ) could enhance the number of events in the highest energy bins . </S>",
    "<S> one should wait for future superkamiokande data , where such possible systematic effects will be further elaborated . </S>",
    "<S> the data from the sno detector , which will come in the operation soon , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , can shed light on this excess .    </S>",
    "<S> another possible explanation of this excess  @xcite is that the hep neutrino flux might be significantly larger ( about a factor 1020 ) than the ssm prediction . </S>",
    "<S> the hep flux depends on solar properties , such as the @xmath3he abundance and the temperature , and on @xmath4 , the zero - energy astrophysical @xmath5-factor of the reaction . </S>",
    "<S> both ssm based  @xcite and model - independent  @xcite approaches give a robust prediction for the ratio @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this scenario implies a cross - section larger by a factor 1020 than the present calculations ( for reviews see  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a large correction to the calculation does not seem likely , though it is not excluded . </S>",
    "<S> a large hep neutrino flux remains a possible explanation of the excess . </S>",
    "<S> the signature of hep neutrinos , the presence of electrons above the maximum boron neutrino energy , can be tested by the sno experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> the superkamiokande collaboration noticed  @xcite that vacuum oscillations with large @xmath7 explain the observed high - energy excess . </S>",
    "<S> however , the same ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite emphasizes that those oscillation parameters that reproduce the excess do not solve the solar neutrino problem ( snp ) , _ i.e. _ , they do not explain the global rates observed by the four solar neutrino experiments . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was demonstrated that if the ssm prediction for the boron neutrino flux is reduced by factor @xmath8 and the chlorine experimental signal is arbitrarily assumed to be larger by a factor @xmath9 , the vacuum oscillation solution to snp ( global rates ) corresponds to @xmath10  ev@xmath11 and @xmath12 : this choice of parameters reproduces also the excess of high - energy recoil electrons in the superkamiokande spectrum  @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we shall further elaborate upon this specific vacuum oscillation solution . for the sake of conciseness </S>",
    "<S> , we shall refer to this solution ( @xmath10  ev@xmath11 and @xmath12 ) as hee ( high - energy excess ) vo .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall start with a short description of relevant features of those vacuum oscillation solutions , whose parameters fit all global rates ; these solutions will be indicated altogether as vo .    </S>",
    "<S> vacuum oscillations can reconcile the ssm with the observed rates of all three kinds of solar neutrino experiments ( for reviews see  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> a recent detailed study  @xcite of vo solutions shows that global fits to the data result in oscillation parameters within the ranges @xmath13  ev@xmath14  ev@xmath11 and @xmath15 for oscillations between active neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the large range of @xmath16 is mainly caused by uncertainties in the b - neutrino flux , though other uncertainties contribute too ; @xmath7 is much less sensitive to changes of the b - neutrino flux . </S>",
    "<S> these effects have been explicitly investigated in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in the ssm the b - neutrino flux uncertainties ( @xmath17  @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> are mainly caused by the uncertainties in @xmath18 ( the @xmath19-be cross section is poorly known ) and by the strong temperature dependence of this flux . </S>",
    "<S> the above uncertainties are only @xmath20 errors and the actual discrepancy could be larger , especially due to the @xmath18 factor . </S>",
    "<S> this large uncertainty of the b - neutrino flux has motivated several authors to consider the boron flux as @xmath21 with @xmath22 as a free parameter  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a signature of vacuum oscillation is the anomalous seasonal variation of the neutrino flux at low energies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between the sun and the earth varies during the year by about 3% affecting the detected flux both because of the @xmath23 geometrical factor and because of the dependence of the survival probability @xmath24 on the distance . </S>",
    "<S> the second effect is absent for msw solutions . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the msw solution also predicts seasonal variations of neutrino flux , which are connected with the day / night effect and are caused by the longer winter nights ( for recent calculations see  @xcite and references to earlier works therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> the msw seasonal variations are weaker than the vo ones at low energies . in the case of vo </S>",
    "<S> , the monochromatic be - neutrinos are expected to show the strongest seasonal variations  @xcite ; on the contrary , be - neutrinos should show very small seasonal variations in the case of msw oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> since be - neutrinos are monochromatic , their flux shows the entire seasonal variation predicted by vo ; the effect is reduced for the other fluxes due to the averaging over the different phases of neutrinos with different energies within the interval of observation , @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> seasonal variations for @xmath7 larger than the values allowed by vo solutions were recently analyzed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the authors found some significant consequences such as energy dependence and correlation with distortion of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the latter effect was also discussed earlier in ref .  @xcite . in relation to the chlorine signal </S>",
    "<S> , seasonal variations were analysed in early work  @xcite . a clear discussion of the seasonal variation effect has been presented in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    to explain the excess in electron spectrum observed by superkamiokande we allow a boron neutrino flux 1520% smaller than the ssm prediction , and we allow that the chlorine signal be about 30% larger than the homestake observation . </S>",
    "<S> this assumed @xmath26 increase could have a combined statistical and systematic origin though we do not have any concrete argument in favor of such systematic error in the homestake experiment .    in our calculation , we shall use neutrino fluxes from the bp98 model  @xcite with the b - neutrino flux rescaled as @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> for the chlorine rate we assume @xmath28  snu ( the homestake experiment gives the rate  @xcite @xmath29  snu ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that for @xmath30 the assumed signal 3.33  snu is @xmath26 higher than one given by homestake ( systematic and statistical error are incoherently combined ) .    for the gallium rate we use the average of the gallex  @xcite and sage  @xcite results : </S>",
    "<S> @xmath31  snu . finally , we take the superkamiokande result  @xcite : @xmath32  @xmath33s@xmath34 . for each pair </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 and @xmath35 we find the vo solution , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , the parameters ( @xmath36 ) , that explain the observed rates , and then we calculate the corresponding boron neutrino spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath37 and @xmath30 the oscillation parameters ( @xmath38  ev@xmath39 ) give a good fit to all rates ( @xmath40/d.o.f . </S>",
    "<S> = 3.0/3 ) : this is not the best fit point , which has @xmath41 , therefore the 3 d.o.f . </S>",
    "<S> are the three experimental rates . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the spectrum with these oscillation parameters reproduces  @xcite the excess of high - energy events observed in the superkamiokande spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , this choice of oscillation parameters gives rates in agreement with the experiments at the @xmath42 level for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 we present the neutrino - induced electron spectra for the vacuum oscillation solutions as the ratio to the ssm unmodified spectrum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted and dashed curves show two spectra corresponding to the vo solutions of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line shows the vo oscillation solution that is discussed in this paper ( hee vo ) corresponding to @xmath45  ev@xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath37 and @xmath30 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the role of the two parameters , @xmath22 and @xmath35 , for the best fit of the spectrum is different : while @xmath22 mostly changes @xmath16 , @xmath35 affects @xmath7 and , therefore , the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> values of @xmath35 as low as 1.2 already give a bad fit to the observed spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous seasonal variations of be - neutrino flux and of the gallium signal are shown in the fig .  2 ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> anomalous seasonal variation is described by the survival probability of the electron neutrino @xmath24 . for be - neutrinos with energy @xmath46  mev the survival probability ( the suppression factor for electron neutrinos ) </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48  cm is the semimajor axis , @xmath49 is the eccentricity of the earth s orbit , and @xmath50  yr is the orbital period . </S>",
    "<S> the phase in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) is such that @xmath51 corresponds to the aphelion . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 the solid and dashed curves show the variation of the be - neutrino flux for the hee vo and vo  @xcite cases , respectively . the case of the hee vo ( solid curve ) is dramatically different from the vo case : there are two maxima and minima during one year and the survival probability oscillates between @xmath52 and 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the explanation is obvious : the hee vo solution has a large @xmath7 , which results in a phase @xmath53 , large enough to produce two full harmonics during one year , when the phase changes by about 3% due to the factor @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the flat central maximum with a shallow local minimum has a trivial origin : the extrema of @xmath24 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) correspond to phases @xmath55 , where k are integers , and to the phases with @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the accidental proximity of these phases can result in three nearby extrema . </S>",
    "<S> the shallow minimum in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 disappears with small changes in @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> the phases of maxima and minima in terms of t / t are not fixed in the hee vo solution , because tiny changes of @xmath7 shift their positions : _ e.g. _ , 1% change in @xmath7 shifts the position of an extremum by more than one month ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) ) .    as one can see from fig .  2 </S>",
    "<S> , the hee vo solution predicts that the beryllium electron neutrinos should arrive almost unsuppressed during about four months in a year !    according to the ssm , beryllium neutrinos contribute 34.4  snu out of the total gallium signal of 129  snu . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the strong @xmath1be neutrino oscillation predicted by the hee vo solution also implies an appreciable variation of total gallium signal . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 the dotted curve shows this variation corresponding to the hee vo solution , which can be compared with the weaker variation corresponding to the best - fit vo solution ( dashed - dotted curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the hee vo variation could already be partially testable by the existing gallium data , and this possibility will significantly increase when the results from gno with its larger statistics are available .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 the predicted time variation of the gallium signal is compared with gallex data ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> gallex data have been analysed according to the time of the year of the exposures and grouped in six two - month bins ( m.  cribier cited in @xcite ) : the data points with error bars in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 reproduce the result of this analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the data give the rates averaged for the same two months every year of observations . the theoretical prediction ( solid curve ) </S>",
    "<S> is plotted with the same averaging . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath57 geometrical variation is included . </S>",
    "<S> both the phase of the time - variation and the average flux have been taken to fit the data . </S>",
    "<S> the fit by the theoretical curve has @xmath40/d.o.f.= 0.85/4 ; the fit by a nonoscillating signal is also good : @xmath40/d.o.f.=1.36/5 . because of the limited statistics </S>",
    "<S> , we do not interpret the good visual agreement in fig .  3 as a proof of hee vo solution , though it is certainly suggestive .    </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the predicted time variation with preliminary data @xcite of the other gallium detector sage is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this time we can not choose the phase arbitrary : it is already fixed by the fit to the gallex data . because of the larger fluctuations of the sage data ( compare fig .  3 and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) the agreement with the predicted variation is worse .    in fig .  5 the predicted variation is compared with the homestake data ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for an earlier analysis of indications for seasonal oscillations in the homestake data ) . </S>",
    "<S> the phase of the theoretical dependence is kept fixed at the value fitted to the gallex data . as for the gallex data we find that the hee vo theoretical curve gives a better fit ( @xmath40/d.o.f.=1.4/5 ) than the time - independent signal , which however can not be excluded ( @xmath40/d.o.f.=3.1/5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement is further strengthened by the fact that the phase of time dependence was not chosen to fit the homestake data , since it was already fixed by the gallex data . </S>",
    "<S> one should consider this agreement as additional indication for the hee vo solution .    finally , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 6 ( fig .  7 ) we compare the time variation of the superkamiokande signal for recoil electrons with energies higher than 10  mev ( 11.5  mev ) with the hee vo predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the fit of the data is good : @xmath40/d.o.f.=2.7/7 ( @xmath40/d.o.f.=5.1/7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar calculations were done by the superkamiokande collaboration  @xcite , by a.  smirnov ( private communication ) and by m.  maris and s.  petcov  @xcite .    while the agreement between the hee vo solution and each single observational datum on seasonal variations might appear accidental and not statistically significant , the combined agreement with all data on seasonal variations , as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 37 ( total @xmath58 ) , appears to be quite a suggestion in favour of the hee vo solution .    as in our previous work  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we prefer not to make a global fit in terms of @xmath59 to all available data ( rates , spectrum and time variations ) . </S>",
    "<S> the large number of degrees of freedom can hide a discrepancy with some particular data , especially if it corresponds to only one degree of freedom , like the chlorine rate in our case . </S>",
    "<S> a small @xmath40 is only a necessary condition for the correct model . </S>",
    "<S> one can find such a global fit in the paper by barger and whisnant  @xcite , which appeared after this work was completed . </S>",
    "<S> the authors study the vo solution with @xmath60  ev@xmath11 and @xmath12 , _ i.e. _ , parameters close the ones we consider . </S>",
    "<S> they find this solution as the global best fit to the rates , spectrum and time dependence of superkamiokande signal ( @xmath61 for 26 degrees of freedom ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , the combination of a b - neutrino flux 20% lower than in the ssm ( easily allowed by the present uncertainties ) and of the assumption that the chlorine signal be @xmath62 ( @xmath26 ) higher than the one presently observed by homestake results in a vacuum oscillation solution ( hee vo ) that fits the electron spectrum recently observed by superkamiokande . </S>",
    "<S> this solution predicts strong seasonal variation of @xmath1be - neutrino flux : some indication to such a variation is already seen in the gallex and homestake data . </S>",
    "<S> seasonal dependence of the superkamiokande data for electron energies higher than 10  mev and 11.5  mev provide further indication in favour of the hee vo solution . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous seasonal variation of be - neutrino flux predicted by the hee vo solution can be reliably observed by the future borexino  @xcite and lens  @xcite detectors </S>",
    "<S> . additionally , lens , which should measure the flux and spectrum of @xmath63 neutrinos , will be able to observe the suppression of @xmath63 neutrino flux , @xmath64 , which is another signature of vo solutions . </S>"
