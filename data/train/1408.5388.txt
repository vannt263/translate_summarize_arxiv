    "none of the local studies produced a statistically significant detection of dark matter .",

    "axis ratios of the particle distribution are determined following the iterative technique outlined in  4.2 of @xcite , which identifies isodensity contours .",
    "this procedure is analogous to that used in @xcite , though it uses differential shells ( in increments of 0.5 kpc ) instead of cumulative shells , following @xcite . for both dark matter particles and stellar halo particles ,",
    "the @xmath69 axis ratio is always greater than or equal to @xmath70 and less than @xmath71 , indicating the distributions are nearly but not completely axisymmetric in the @xmath68 direction . at the virial radius ,",

    "the @xmath73 axis ratio is a measure of the departure from spherical symmetry for axisymmetric shells .",

    "as the bottom panel of figure  [ f : axis_ratios ] shows , in this @xmath1body simulation , both the dark matter and stellar distributions are oblate , and the dark matter @xmath73 axis ratio does not vary significantly over the entire sdss volume .",
    "one final thing to consider before we apply jeans equations to the simulation : what do the true accelerations look like for the simulation ?",
    "the top panel of figure  [ f : ratio_az ] shows the mean component of the acceleration in the @xmath7 direction projected into the @xmath6-@xmath7 grid ; here , the acceleration of each particle was calculated using the force from all the particles in the entire simulation .",
    "for comparison , the middle panel shows an analogous map , but here , the acceleration of each star and gas particle was calculated using only the contributions from other star and gas particles ( that is , the contribution from the dark matter was not included ) . as evident , there are substantial differences in the morphology of the two maps ; the bottom panel shows the ratio of the top and middle panel .",
    "this panel demonstrates that _ the effect of dark matter on the acceleration in the @xmath7 direction increases quickly away from the plane of the disk and towards the outer parts of the galaxy _ ; for example , the ratio of accelerations is doubled by @xmath6=8 kpc and @xmath7=6 kpc .",
    "these distances are probed by sdss  hence these results suggest that the effect of dark matter on stellar acceleration may be uncovered in sdss data , and that stellar populations in the halo are more sensitive to the existence of dark matter than disk stars .    along the same lines ,",
    "the top panel of figure  [ f : ratio_ar ] illustrates the mean component of the acceleration in the @xmath6 direction when the force of all the particles ( gas , dark matter and stars ) in the simulation is considered , while the middle panel shows the mean component when the force of just gas and star particles are considered .",
    "the bottom panel shows a ratio of the top panel to the middle panel ; the effects of dark matter are easily discernible ; for example , the ratio of accelerations is doubled by @xmath6=8 kpc and @xmath7=4 kpc .",
    "when constraining the galactic potential via jeans equations with sdss ( or any other survey ) data , several preliminary analysis steps are required :    1 .   in order to quantify the stellar number density distribution as a function of coordinates @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath7 ( @xmath8 in equations  [ eq : eq1 ] and [ eq : eq2 ] ) , the appropriate stellar population needs to be selected ( e.g. halo stars ) , the distances to the stars need to be estimated , and the observational selection function accounted for .",
    "in addition , the assumption of cylindrical symmetry must be tested , and the impact of local substructure ( e.g. stellar streams ) quantified .",
    "2 .   in order to quantify the four velocity dispersions and the mean azimuthal velocity as functions of coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 , complex kinematics ( proper motion and radial velocity measurements ) are needed and require substantial analysis .",
    "for example , the error dependence for the radial velocity components and the error dependence for the tangential velocity components are fundamentally different as a function of distance .",
    "notably , the tangential velocity components are computed as the product of distance and proper motion measurements , and these errors carry their own hidden dependence on distance .",
    "proper motion errors increase for faint stars , and more distant stars are generally fainter than closer ones .",
    "these tasks are far from trivial , but fortunately they have already been undertaken and published .",
    "j08 accomplished the first task of quantifying the stellar number density distribution for both disk and halo components .",
    "they showed that the stellar number density distribution , @xmath76 , can be well described ( apart from local overdensities ) as a sum of two cylindrically symmetric components    @xmath77    the disk component can be modeled as a sum of two exponential disks ( see their equations  22 and 23 ) , while the halo component requires an oblate bi - axial ( cylindrically symmetric ) power - law model    @xmath78    here @xmath79 is the local solar neighborhood density of tracer stars , and @xmath80 measures the local fractional contribution of halo stars .",
    "the number count normalization , @xmath79 , reflects how tracer stars are selected , and is related to the local luminosity function . since the overall normalization of @xmath81 in equations  [ eq : eq1 ] and [ eq : eq2 ] cancels out",
    ", @xmath79 is not of further interest in this context .",
    "j08 obtained best - fit mw parameters using sdss data , after accounting for selection effects and masking regions with prominent substructure ; their results are listed for both the stellar disk and stellar halo components in their table 10 ( second column ) . for completeness , they obtained @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , with estimated uncertainties of 25% , @xmath850.1 , and @xmath850.2 , respectively .",
    "we note that the best - fit values for @xmath86 and @xmath87 are covariant  the more symmetric halos correspond to larger @xmath87 , see their figure 22 .",
    "they also tested for cylindrical symmetry ( see their figure 11 ) and could not reject their best - fit axisymmetric number counts model .",
    "i08 studied the metallicity distribution of disk and halo stars and , of direct relevance to this work , demonstrated that the multi - component ( i.e. disk and halo ) decomposition of @xmath81 from equation  [ eq : nudh ] is not a case of over - fitting ; instead , a fairly simple selection , @xmath88   = -1 $ ] , clearly separates disk and halo components ( see their figures 5 and 9 ) and justifies the decomposition model from equation  [ eq : nudh ] .",
    "b10 performed a detailed analysis of available kinematic data for the sdss stellar sample : radial velocities were derived from the sdss spectroscopic survey and proper motions were obtained by comparing sdss astrometry and palomar observatory sky survey astrometry @xcite from @xmath050 years earlier .",
    "their main result of interest to this work is a clear demonstration ( see their figures  12 and 13 ) that the velocity ellipsoid for halo stars is invariant in spherical coordinates within the volume probed by sdss data ( galactocentric distances of @xmath8520 kpc ) . the very complex behavior of measured proper motions ( see their figure  14 ) and radial velocities ( see their figure  15 ) on the sky can be explained with a simple triaxial velocity ellipsoid that is invariant in spherical coordinates , @xmath89=141 km s@xmath90 , @xmath10=85 km s@xmath90 , and @xmath91=75 km s@xmath90 , with uncertainties of about 5 km s@xmath90 .",
    "their leading sources of uncertainty are distance scale errors , local standard of rest errors , and systematic errors in radial - velocity and proper - motion measurements ; see their section 5.3 for details . given the velocity ellipsoid in spherical coordinates , it can be transformed to cylindrical coordinates as @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 where @xmath95 .    together with the spatial distribution of halo stars given by equation  [ eq : nudh2 ] , these equations are sufficient to evaluate all terms listed in equations  [ eq : eq1 ] and [ eq : eq2 ] .",

    "such analytic results properly account for the sdss selection function and galactic substructure .",
    "however , this approach does not include the effects of finite stellar counts , counting noise , and volume edges .",

    "we set the bin width to be 1 kpc , and we require at least 100 stellar particles per bin to minimize the shot noise .",
    "all quantities are computed using weights proportional to the mass of each stellar particle ( assumed constant in the _ galfast _ catalogs ) .    to estimate the gradients required in equations  [ eq : eq1 ] and [ eq : eq2 ] ( _ i.e .",

    "galfast_. furthermore , we can test the resulting acceleration maps by directly taking appropriate spatial derivatives of the analytic expressions for the spatial distribution from j08 and kinematics from b10 ( that is , we can bypass the _ galfast _ step ) .",
    "since these derivatives ( `` analytic '' maps ) can be evaluated with negligible numerical noise , unlike derivatives based on a mock sample ( `` numerical '' maps ) , we can measure the bias and scatter due to a finite - size sample ( to the extent that analytic expressions from j08 and b10 are correct , these analytic maps represent ground truth ; for their illustration and further discussion see  [ sec : dmpot ] ) .",
    "a comparison of the analytic and numerical maps reveals that they are morphologically very similar ; we find that the latter are biased low by 3% for the @xmath103 maps and by 14% for the @xmath104 map , with a root - mean - square scatter of 25% ( over all the pixels ) for both maps .",

    "our data is binned in 1 kpc square @xmath6-@xmath7 pixels ; we also investigated smaller bin sizes , down to twice the force softening length ( 346 parsec ) . because the star particle number density decreases quickly with increased galactocentric radius , the adopted size of 1",

    "a comparison between the @xmath1body simulation and the sdss - based acceleration maps strongly suggests that a dark matter component is needed to account for the observed accelerations .",
    "however , the strength of this conclusion depends on how well the @xmath1body simulation matches the observed mw . to supplement our earlier argument , in this section we perform an analysis of the observed acceleration maps that does not require the use of the @xmath1body simulation . instead",
    ", we utilize a new observationally constrained description of the mw gravitational potential ; we quantitatively compare this potential to our sdss - based acceleration maps to draw conclusions about the dark matter potential . because our _ galfast_-based acceleration maps suffer from numerical noise ( recall  [ sec : numprocs ] ) , here we use the `` analytic '' acceleration maps computed directly using equation  [ eq : nudh2 ] from j08 and the velocity ellipsoid for halo stars from b10 ( see equations  [ eq : sigrr][eq : sigrz ] ) .",

    "encouragingly , these trends are in qualitative agreement with the predictions from the @xmath1body simulation ( see bottom panels in figures  [ f : ratio_az ] and [ f : ratio_ar ] ) .",
    "we next compare the accelerations predicted by the br13 two - component potential model to our sdss - based analytic acceleration maps .",
    "our goal is to understand how well the two - component model , containing a spherically symmetric dark matter halo , fits our sdss - based results .",
    "we begin by considering the data / model ratio : for the model to be a good match to our data , the median value of the ratio should be roughly 1.0 with a small rms ( @xmath146@xmath147 on a linear scale ) . in both the cases ( @xmath19 and @xmath97 ) , to achieve a median data / model ratio of 1.0 ,",
    "we must rescale the model by multiplying by 0.66 and 0.57 respectively . after these renormalizations , the rms scatter is fairly small ( 23% on a linear scale ) .",
    "however , because the model derived @xmath19 and @xmath97 require _ different _ renormalizations , and there are systematic deviations as functions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we conclude that _ the data versus model discrepancy can not be resolved by a simple rescaling alone . _    to re - emphasize this point , we draw upon an illustrative example . at @xmath148 kpc , @xmath149 kpc , the extrapolated br13 model predicts @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( in units of @xmath152 km / s@xmath153 ) resulting from the dark matter component , and @xmath154 and @xmath155 from baryon component .",
    "however , at this location the measured sdss - based accelerations are @xmath156 and @xmath157 . that is , _ the model dark matter component by itself exceeds the total measured acceleration_.    in contrast to this , we consider @xmath97 in the solar neighborhood at small @xmath7 ( @xmath158 kpc , @xmath159 kpc ) . here",
    "our sdss - based acceleration is @xmath160 km / s@xmath153 . converting this to an equivalent surface density yields 65 @xmath161/pc@xmath153 , with an uncertainty of @xmath010%",

    "hence , the sdss - based @xmath104 derived from our halo sample is @xmath016% smaller than the acceleration based on disk sample at @xmath158 kpc , @xmath159 kpc , but the two values are consistent within quoted statistical errors .    in summary , our acceleration maps are statistically consistent with @xcite at @xmath7 as small as 3 kpc ; additionally , we explore much larger galactocentric distances which allows us to draw new constraints on the dark matter potential .",

    "[ sec : validity ] .",
    "we now generate model maps in better agreement with the data by including two modifications to the original br13 model : 1 ) we allow for a renormalization of the baryonic component ( which is much better constrained than dark matter component , in both shape and amplitude , and thus we expect a renormalization factor close to unity ) , and 2 ) we allow departures from spherical symmetry for the dark matter component ( as motivated by disagreements at large galactocentric radii ) .",
    "henceforth , we adopt the following description for the gravitational potential used to generate the model acceleration maps @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the component due to baryons ( stars and interstellar medium ) , @xmath165 is a renormalization factor ( discussed in more detail below ) and @xmath166 is the component due to dark matter ( e.g. , see equation  2 - 54a in @xcite ) , @xmath167 the free model parameters are @xmath165 , the dark matter potential scale ( @xmath168 ) , the spatial scale ( @xmath169 ) , and the dark matter axis ratio ( @xmath170 ) . given @xmath171 , we compute @xmath172 and @xmath173 .    the chosen logarithmic potential is convenient because its corresponding matter density can be expressed analytically ( see eq .

    "the variation of @xmath179 is shown in the left panel in figure  [ fig : deltafit1 ] .",
    "the plausible ( _ i.e .",

    "the axis ratio for the dark matter potential is strongly constrained to the range @xmath186 , and is essentially independent of the choice of @xmath169 .",

    "allowing for a non - spherical dark matter potential greatly improves the agreement between the data and the model in both cases : the rms scatter is 5% for @xmath103 and 3% for @xmath104 , whereas there was a 23% scatter and need for differing renormalization factors for the original model .",
    "as can be seen in the right panel of figure  [ fig : accdmratios ] , the largest discrepancy between the @xmath104 data and the best - fit @xmath104 model ( shown in dark blue ) is found at small @xmath7 , where we know that our map is biased by 16% relative to the br13 results . in the left panel of figure  [ fig : accdmratios ] , the largest discrepancy between the @xmath19 data and the best - fit @xmath19 model ( shown in red ) is found at the smallest @xmath6 and large @xmath7 , with measured acceleration 1.8 times larger than the best - fit model value .",
    "we conclude that either one of the two adopted sdss results from j08 or b10 is problematic in this region , or that the adopted model potential is incapable of fully explaining observations .",
    "we continue this discussion in  [ sec : validity ] .",

    ", @xmath169 is plausibly within @xmath188 ) . here , we investigate if relevant local measurements can strengthen our constraints on @xmath169 and provide a check for our best - fit dark matter potential .",
    "before we can utilize any local mass measurements , we must convert our analytic gravitational potential to a mass density distribution .",
    "fortunately , @xcite provides the following expression for converting to matter density ( see their equation  2 - 54b ) from a gravitational potential of the functional form described by equation  [ eq : potdm ] ,    @xmath189    using this expression with our best - fit values of @xmath181 , @xmath190 , and @xmath183 km / s , we obtain @xmath191 = 0.004 @xmath192 , with an estimated uncertainty of only about 10% due in large part to our uncertainty in @xmath169 .",
    "this @xmath191 estimate is within statistical agreement with the result of @xmath193 @xmath192 from @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , when @xmath194 , the density distribution predicted by equation  [ eq : rhodm ] is negative near the @xmath7 axis for @xmath195 .",
    "however , this unphysical behavior is of no concern here because _",
    "@xmath196 kpc even for the smallest allowed @xmath169 _ , which is clearly far beyond the probed volume .    for the small @xmath7 relevant here ,",
    "the isodensity contours are elliptical with the axis ratio given by @xmath197 yielding @xmath198 = 0.36 .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the estimate @xmath199 from @xcite , but we note that the baryon contribution to the potential was not accounted for in their study and thus it is superseded by the above result .",
    "we also consider the dark matter contribution to the local circular speed , which can be computed from ( see equation  2 - 54c in @xcite ) @xmath200 considering the plausible range of @xmath169 ( @xmath201 ) , we estimate @xmath202 to be @xmath203 km / s via a linear fit .",
    "our best - fit value , @xmath204 km / s , is uncertain to within @xmath03 km / s ( again , due to the weak constraints on @xmath169 ) .",
    "thus , we find that considering the local circular speed does not provide a strong constraint on @xmath169 .    the best - fit contribution of dark matter halo to the local circular speed , @xmath204 km / s , is a factor of two smaller than that estimated by br13 .",
    "this discrepancy probably implies that the adopted logarithmic potential given by equation  [ eq : potdm ] close to the galactic plane does not have sufficient curvature in the @xmath7 direction to produce larger @xmath205 ( the normalization @xmath184 can not be responsible because it s value is set by distant halo stars ) . a similar `` curvature problem '' close to the plane ( and close to the symmetry axis ) with j08 and b10 results",
    "is discussed in  [ sec : validity ] .      at large galactocentric radii the dark matter contribution to the force felt by halo stars dominates over the baryon contribution .",
    "measurements are precise enough to test whether functional forms other than the adopted logarithmic potential given by equation  [ eq : potdm ] would fit the data .",
    "we first test whether a single value of @xmath170 is sufficient : using equation  [ eq : qdmdirect ] , but this time with the br13 baryon contribution subtracted from the measured maps , we find that the median value ( per bin ) of @xmath170 is 0.67 , with ( inter - quartile based ) scatter of @xmath206 .",
    "the small width of the @xmath170 distribution indicates that the spatial variation of the acceleration maps is well captured by the @xmath35 variable given by equation  [ eq : xvar ] .",

    "forcing @xmath218 does not provide a satisfactory fit for any @xmath219 .",
    "therefore , while a logarithmic potential is fully consistent with the data , it is not a unique solution .",
    "the main reason for this ambiguity is the small dynamic range of @xmath35 due to the finite sampled volume .",
    "we reiterate that @xmath194 is robustly determined irrespective of the detailed form for @xmath220 .      in our analysis above",
    ", we assumed that the baryon component in the br13 potential is perfect ( @xmath174 ) .",

    "we find that in this case , @xmath218 is indeed strongly preferred , and we obtain @xmath233 , which is consistent with the k10 results .",
    "k10 go on to estimate @xmath170 by including a simple baryon bulge+disk model in their analysis ; from this , they find a lower limit on @xmath170 ( @xmath234 at the 90% confidence level ) .",
    "this lower limit appears to exclude our best - fit value ; however , the differing results are not surprising given the fact that _ their baryon model is significantly different than ours_. it is likely that the baryon component determined by br13 is much more robust than the model used by k10 .",
    "_ we reiterate that when using the same functional form for the potential , we get the same best - fit model parameters as k10 .",
    "_ thus , in an indirect sense , the accelerations measured by halo stars are consistent with the potential needed to explain observations of the gd-1 stream .",
    "it is certainly surprising that a single - component potential can provide a good description of acceleration maps for halo stars , especially given the complex morphology of the b13 baryon component ( see the top panels in figure  [ fig : brfractions ] ) .",
    "we consider this in further detail by comparing our best - fit two - component model with a single - component model .",
    "the ratios predicted for the @xmath19 and @xmath97 maps are shown in the left and right panels of figure  [ fig : rat2over1 ] respectively .    as can be seen in both panels of figure  [ fig : rat2over1 ] , above @xmath2353 - 4 kpc ,",
    "the two models agree quite well ( shown in green and matching to within 10% ) . this , in fact , is the region where most of constraints from both the k10 analysis and our analysis come from .",
    "however , given the @xmath236 kpc constraints from br13 , it is clear that a single - component model does not have the flexibility to explain simultaneously both the br13 segue g dwarfs data and our sdss halo stars data .",
    "for example , at @xmath158 kpc and @xmath58 , the single - component model predicts acceleration that is too small by a factor of 6 compared to the best - fit two - component model and constraints from br13 .",
    "we conclude from this that the potential from k10 can not be extrapolated close to the galactic plane .",
    "the best - fit model adopted here does not suffer from this problem because close to the plane it is dominated by the baryon component .",
    "nevertheless , recall that the contribution of the dark matter halo to the local circular speed is a factor of 2 smaller than estimated by br13 .",
    "modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) is a proposed alternative to dark matter , which posits a breakdown of newtonian dynamics in the limit of small accelerations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "when the newtonian acceleration , @xmath237 , is much larger than a characteristic acceleration scale , @xmath238 , the acceleration felt by a test particle is newtonian , @xmath239 .",
    "however , when @xmath240 , the acceleration felt by a test particle is much larger than the newtonian prediction , @xmath241 .",
    "the characteristic acceleration scale is about @xmath152 km / s@xmath153 , that is , very similar to the range of accelerations felt by halo stars in the volume probed by the sdss . in the acceleration range between these two extremes , the acceleration is given by an interpolating function @xmath242 where @xmath243 .",
    "the interpolating function @xmath244 satisfies @xmath245 for @xmath246 , and @xmath247 when @xmath248 .",
    "for example , @xcite investigated functions such as @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "the physical basis of mond theories is discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition to sampling the relevant range of acceleration , the sdss data for halo stars simultaneously constrains two components of acceleration and enables a very powerful test of the mond model .",
    "the left panel in figure  [ fig : mond ] shows the ratio of acceleration due to baryons from the br13 model and the measured acceleration for halo stars as a function of the measured acceleration .",
    "mond models predict that the two should be correlated , and indeed data for each component ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) show remarkably small scatter about a mean trend .",
    "however , the two trends are significantly offset from each other and it is impossible to fit them both with a single interpolating function .",
    "in other words , both the magnitude of the measured acceleration is different than predicted by the baryons , _ and _ the direction of the acceleration vector is different .",
    "since mond modifies only the former , it can not explain the latter .    for further illustration , figure  [ fig : mondangle ]",
    "shows the variation of the angle between the measured acceleration vector and the acceleration vector predicted by the br13 model for baryons within the probed volume ; this angle is in the range 0@xmath25110@xmath251 , with a median value of 4.7@xmath251 .",
    "the largest values are found for the largest @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; significantly detected differences between the direction of the measured acceleration vector and the direction of the baryon - based prediction are found for @xmath252 kpc and @xmath211 kpc . for example , at the bin with @xmath253 kpc and @xmath254 kpc , the angle between the measured acceleration vector and the direction towards the galactic center is 12.5@xmath251 , and the angle between the acceleration predicted by the baryon model and the direction towards the galactic center is 3.2@xmath251  this is a difference of 9.3@xmath251 ( see vectors marked in the figure ) !",
    "this mismatch angle can not be explained by mond ; mond only modifies the length of the baryon prediction but not its direction . for the same reason",
    ", a spherical dark matter halo does not work either  its prediction always points directly towards the gc .",
    "the _ vector sum _ of the dark matter contribution for an _ oblate halo _ and the baryon contribution produces a satisfactory model .    to quantitatively estimate the disagreement between our data and mond models , we have tried three different interpolating functions , @xmath255 , @xmath256 and @xmath257 , where the index @xmath258 in the last one was determined as a free parameter .",
    "the corresponding best - fit values of the characteristic acceleration are @xmath259 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 , respectively ( in units of 10@xmath262 km / s@xmath153 ) .",
    "the scatter of data around the model prediction is smallest for the third mond model , 17% .",
    "this scatter is still more than three times larger than for the best - fit model with dark matter from the preceding section , which produces a scatter of 4.8% .",
    "the data / model ratio distributions are shown in the right panel in figure  [ fig : mond ] .",
    "if data for @xmath103 and @xmath104 are treated separately , then the scatter for each can be decreased to about 10% , but the ratio of best - fit values of @xmath238 ( using the third model ) is significantly different from 1 ( 0.39 for @xmath103 and 0.27 for @xmath104 ) . because it is impossible to construct a single mond model that outperforms the model with dark matter , the latter is statistically preferred .",
    "therefore , thanks to precise two - dimensional measurements of acceleration for halo stars , we can reject the mond model as an explanation of the observed behavior .",
    "the model that incorporates a dark matter halo is in much better agreement with the data .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that these conclusions are critically dependent on the accuracy of the baryon potential .",
    "we have demonstrated that the sdss observations of the mw stellar halo combined with the gravitational potential due to baryons derived by br13 , imply the existence of an invisible component that contributes to the overall gravitational potential . at large galactocentric distances ( @xmath020  kpc ) , the detection of this component is highly significant and robust because the gravitational force experienced by halo stars is as much as three times stronger than what can be attributed to purely visible matter .",
    "our results are derived using jeans equations , which estimate the gradient of the gravitational potential statistically from the observed spatial variation of stellar counts and stellar kinematics ( equations 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the derivation of these equations assumes a cylindrically symmetric steady - state system .",
    "both available mw data and @xmath1body simulations indicate that these assumptions can not be fully satisfied and thus the performance of the jeans equations method must be critically examined before drawing conclusions .    using a modern cosmologically derived @xmath1body simulation , designed to mimic the formation and evolution of a mw ",
    "like galaxy , we showed that the jeans equations method can uncover true accelerations despite deviations from a steady - state system with cylindrical symmetry : we recovered true mean per - bin accelerations with random errors below 20% and a bias below 10% .",
    "such a precision is more than sufficient to robustly detect deviations between the measured acceleration and the acceleration that can be attributed to baryonic material .",
    "when applied to sdss data , this method produced two - dimensional acceleration maps to heliocentric distances exceeding @xmath010  kpc and galactocentric distances exceeding @xmath020  kpc .",
    "it was possible to probe this large distance range thanks to substantial sdss sky coverage and accurate multi - color photometry to faint limits .",
    "leveraging the baryonic gravitational potential from br13 , we showed that the gravitational force experienced by halo stars at galactocentric distances of @xmath020  kpc can not be explained , in a newtonian framework , by only baryon matter contributions . at these large galactocentric distances ,",
    "the discrepancy is much larger than in the solar neighborhood because the baryonic material is concentrated in the galactic disk , while the presumed dark matter is much more extended .",
    "we attempted to construct a mond model in agreement with the data , but found that our best - fit mond model is significantly outperformed by a model with dark matter .",
    "mond s inability to explain the data is related to the evidence for a non - spherical dark matter distribution ( which comes from the oblate spatial distribution of halo stars ) .",
    "_ specifically , the magnitude of the measured acceleration is different than predicted by baryons , and the direction of the measured acceleration vector is different , too .",
    "since mond modifies only the former , it can not explain the latter_. therefore , because of precise two - dimensional measurements of the acceleration of halo stars , mond models can be rejected irrespective of the details assumed in the interpolating function and the value of the characteristic acceleration .",
    "of course , these conclusions are critically dependent on the accuracy of the baryon potential .",
    "the large volume probed by sdss halo stars also provides a strong constraint on the shape of the dark matter halo potential . within galactocentric distances of @xmath020",
    "kpc , the dark matter halo potential is well described by an oblate halo with axis ratio @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4 ; this corresponds to an axis ratio @xmath5@xmath3@xmath4 for the dark matter density distribution .",
    "the quoted uncertainties attempt to account for systematic errors but gaussian behavior can not be guaranteed .",
    "the formal random errors for @xmath263 and @xmath198 do not exceed @xmath00.05 .",
    "the @xmath169 parameter in the logarithmic dark matter model , and the preference for logarithmic over power - law model , are not as well constrained as @xmath263 .",
    "the resulting best - fit two - component gravitational potential , based on the baryonic component from br13 , and the dark matter component described by eq .  [ eq : potdm ] , is simultaneously consistent with relatively local ( within @xmath03 kpc ) measurements of disk stars , and with measurements of halo stars to galactocentric distances of @xmath020  kpc .",
    "the best - fit potential derived here is also consistent with the gravitational potential required to explain the spatial and kinematic behavior of the gd-1 tidal stream .",
    "_ given vastly different selection criteria , spatial distributions and kinematics of these three populations , this consistency is indeed remarkable ! _    nevertheless , it is almost certain that the functional form given by eq .",
    "[ eq : potdm ] _ can not be valid throughout the entire mw halo _ , as we discuss next .",
    "our analysis is based on both stellar count and kinematics data from the sdss galactic catalog , which extends to no more than @xmath020 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "this dataset excludes the vicinity immediately surrounding the galactic center , as well as the region very close to the galactic plane ( closer than @xmath03 kpc ) .",
    "therefore , our results should not be extrapolated beyond this limit .",
    "there are already strong indications that the stellar halo model from j08 , given by equation  [ eq : nudh2 ] , can not be extrapolated beyond a galactocentric distance of about 30 kpc .",
    "@xcite found , using main sequence stars detected by the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) in about 170 deg@xmath153 of sky , that the halo stellar number - density profile becomes steeper at galactocentric distances greater than @xmath028 kpc , with the power - law index changing from @xmath264 to @xmath265 .",
    "they measured the oblateness of the stellar halo to be @xmath2660.01 ( statistical error only ) , and they detected no evidence of the oblateness changing across the range of distances probed .",
    "@xcite explored similar issues , using a sample of @xmath020,000 bhb and blue straggler stars detected by sdss over 14,000 deg@xmath153 of sky , and obtained almost identical results to those from @xcite .",
    "their best fitting model has an inner power - law index of @xmath267 and an outer index of @xmath268 , with the transition occurring at @xmath027 kpc , and a constant stellar halo flattening of @xmath269 .",
    "in addition , the distributions of rr lyrae stars from the sekbo survey @xcite , and of rr lyrae stars from sdss stripe 82 data @xcite , indicate a steeper density profile beyond 30 kpc .",
    "these results are in general agreement with the dual halo hypothesis advocated in @xcite , and references therein ( and also including opposing views ) .",
    "similarly , the finding by b10 that the velocity ellipsoid for halo stars is invariant in spherical coordinates can not be valid beyond about 30 kpc from the galactic center . @xcite used the hypervelocity star survey data to measure the halo radial - velocity dispersion out to 75 kpc .",
    "they obtained results in statistical agreement with similar studies by @xcite and @xcite , which they summarized as : `` the milky way radial - velocity dispersion drops from @xmath270 km s@xmath90 at @xmath271 kpc to @xmath272 km s@xmath90 at @xmath273 kpc '' ( here @xmath274 is the galactocentric spherical radius @xmath275 in this paper ) .",
    "it is hard to quantitatively and robustly estimate what this gradient implies for the underlying potential because the velocity dispersion in two orthogonal directions at distances beyond 30 kpc has not been measured yet ; these measurements will likely have to wait for gaia and lsst surveys ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see below ) ) .",
    "we note that @xcite constrained the dark halo potential using the sagittarius dwarf tidal stream at a large range of galactocentric radii .",
    "they found that the potential is axisymmetric and flattened toward the disk plane within 10 kpc from the galactic center , with @xmath276 . at larger radii , they argue for a triaxial shape in the outer halo , consistent with the @xcite model , with deviations from oblate halo starting at galactocentric distances of about 10 kpc .",
    "the acceleration of the halo stars in the @xmath7 direction and close to the galactic plane is weaker than that experienced by disk stars .",
    "figure  [ fig:3panels ] shows data and models for @xmath277 at @xmath158 kpc and @xmath278 kpc . while at @xmath278 kpc , the agreement between halo and disk star accelerations is satisfactory , at @xmath158 kpc and within a few kpc from the plane , the implied acceleration of halo stars is weaker than that experienced by disk stars , with discrepancy increasing from about a factor of 2 at @xmath279 kpc to larger values at smaller @xmath7 ( note that all values vanish at @xmath58 because of symmetry ) .",
    "it appears that either the spatial distribution of halo stars from j08 , or kinematics from b10 ( or both ) has to break down close to the plane . in order to increase the implied acceleration , more curvature , that is ,",
    "larger derivatives of the spatial distribution and kinematics , are needed close to the plane . with existing data it is hard to quantify what is the problem because the fraction of halo stars is very small close to the plane and it is easy to get sample contamination ( this is why b10 only analyzed halo stars that are more than @xmath03 kpc from the plane ) .",
    "furthermore , turn - off halo stars closer than about 1 kpc are saturated in sdss imaging .",
    "we can postulate a minor modification of the @xmath86 parameter from eq .",
    "[ eq : nudh2 ] , from its best - fit value @xmath83 obtained by j08 , that brings @xmath104 acceleration component of halo stars in agreement with acceleration of disk stars at @xmath279 kpc . the third term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : eq2 ] is proportional to @xmath280 for small @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath86 decreases from 0.64 at @xmath281 kpc to @xmath282 at @xmath279 kpc , the resulting @xmath104 for halo stars becomes similar to @xmath104 for disk stars .",
    "at the same time , the stellar number density given by eq .",
    "[ eq : nudh2 ] is insensitive to @xmath86 for @xmath283 and @xmath284 kpc , and thus remains consistent with j08 and b10 analysis .",
    "the implication is that the halo is more oblate closer to the disk midplane than far away from it , an idea that was already advocated in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is likely that gaia will provide a definitive resolution of this puzzle .",
    "gaia will also likely resolve the origin of the divergence of @xmath103 on the symmetry axis ( @xmath285 ) . because values for @xmath10 and @xmath91 obtained by b10 are different , @xmath103 computed using equation  [ eq : eq1 ] diverges for @xmath285 ( for @xmath285 , @xmath286 )",
    ". proper motion accuracy below 1 mas yr@xmath90 is required to map the behavior of @xmath10 and @xmath91 close to the galaxy s symmetry axis .",
    "figure  [ fig:3panels ] also illustrates that the dark matter component from the original br13 model produces too much force at large @xmath7 .",
    "this discrepancy is resolved by replacing their spherical dark matter model by the new oblate dark matter model introduced here .",
    "while this modification results in a satisfactory explanation for the measured halo star acceleration maps , it fails to produce a sufficiently large dark matter halo contribution to the local circular speed by about a factor of two .",
    "this failure suggests that the adopted logarithmic potential given by equation  [ eq : potdm ] close to the galactic plane does not have sufficient curvature in the @xmath7 direction . in other words ,",
    "the dark matter should be more concentrated toward the plane of the disk the our adopted model predicts .    in summary",
    ", these discrepancies indicate that both the dark matter distribution , and the spatial distribution and kinematics of halo stars , should be sensitive to the existence of a stellar disk , but the current models do not capture this behavior .",
    "in addition to the data limitations , simulations have their own caveats . we have demonstrated using an @xmath1body simulation that the jeans equations method can recover the true stellar acceleration with a bias below 10% . however , the general validity of this conclusion is crucially dependent on the similarity between the simulated galaxy and the mw .",
    "we showed that the simulated galaxy is similar to the mw in many important ways , such as the overall distribution of halo stars and their kinematics .",
    "nevertheless , there are other untested aspects that might be important and perhaps are biasing our measurements of the dark matter halo properties .",
    "for example , @xcite have shown , using data from the sdss segue spectroscopic survey , that about 10% of the halo stars within @xmath020 kpc from the sun cluster kinematically on very small spatial scales ( typical radial - velocity dispersion is @xmath020 km s@xmath90 ) .",
    "it remains to be seen whether simulated galaxies also include this effect , and how it affects the performance of the jeans equations method .",
    "last but not least , in deriving our conclusions we assumed that the br13 baryon potential , derived using a sample of disk g dwarfs , is perfect .",
    "they directly measured @xmath104 ( at @xmath7=1.1 kpc and 4.5 @xmath287 ) from the vertical dynamics and combined it with @xmath288 $ ] from the tangent - point rotation curve measurements .",
    "their model produces @xmath289 equivalent to local circular speed of @xmath290=220 km / s .",
    "since at this time @xmath290 is uncertain by possibly as much as 10% , a similar level of uncertainty is implied for their baryon potential .",
    "it is possible to go beyond jeans equations to use stellar kinematics to probe the full phase space distribution of stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for example , as @xcite recently demonstrated , stellar orbits can be used to determine not only the shape of the inner halo , but the global shape of the galactic halo .",
    "the valluri et al .",
    "orbital spectral analysis method provides a strong complementary tool to the technique presented here for constraining the potential of the milky way halo and its stellar distribution function .",
    "in addition , outcomes of methods such as `` made - to - measure models '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , direct modeling of the distribution function @xcite , and modeling of stellar tidal streams ( k10 ; @xcite ) can be compared to constrain systematic errors of each method and improve understanding of the milky way mass distribution .    the full potential of these methods will be reached by upcoming next - generation surveys , such as gaia @xcite and lsst @xcite .",
    "first , gaia will provide measurements of distances and kinematics with a similar faint flux limit as sdss , but with much smaller errors ( for a comparison of sdss , gaia and lsst astrometric and photometric errors , see figure 21 in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , gaia data will be superior to currently available data for quantifying the spatial distribution and kinematics of halo stars close to the plane .",
    "lsst will obtain photometric and kinematic measurements of comparable accuracy to those of gaia at gaia s faint limit , and extend them deeper by about 5  mag .",
    "with lsst , it will be possible to extend this study to about 10 times larger distance limit than possible today with sdss data @xcite .",
    "most notably , it will be possible to investigate whether the dark matter halo shows any trace of changes in the spatial and kinematic behavior around @xmath030 kpc from the galactic center that are revealed by halo stars .",
    "furthermore , by extending the limiting distance , the impact of baryons will be diminished and the conclusions about dark matter behavior will be more robust .",
