    "finite - resistivity plasma instabilities play an important role for the release of stored magnetic energy in many astrophysical objects .",
    "they also restrict the plasma stability in several fusion devices @xcite .",
    "the simplest configuration in which they appear is the plane sheet pinch . in a pinch a conducting fluid",
    "can be held together by the action of an electric current passing through it with the pressure gradients being balanced by the lorentz force .",
    "of special interest is the resistive tearing instability , which was studied by furth _",
    "@xcite by using a boundary layer approach and afterwards numerically without making the boundary - layer approximation @xcite .",
    "all these studies refer to the infinite hartmann number case because of their neglect of the kinematic viscosity . the hartmann number @xmath0 , which is the geometric mean of two reynolds - like numbers , one being kinetic and the other magnetic , is the essential parameter that determines the global stability boundaries of the plane sheet pinch as well as those of its cylindrical counterpart @xcite .",
    "thus kinematic viscosity has to be included .",
    "a recent sheet pinch study @xcite has been done with spatially and temporally uniform kinematic viscosity and magnetic diffusivity , and with impenetrable stress - free boundaries .",
    "it is found that the quiescent ground state ( in which the current density is uniform and the magnetic field profile across the sheet is linear ) remains stable , no matter how strong the driving electric field .",
    "this study was extended to the case of magnetic diffusivity varying across the sheet , which results in the profiles of the equilibrium magnetic field deviating from linear behavior .",
    "in particular , the conductivity profile may be chosen such that the magnetic - field and/or the current profile have inflection points .",
    "a squire theorem could be proven for this configuration @xcite whose stability depends on the hartmann number , the degree of current concentration about the midplane of the sheet , and on the magnetic shear ( i.e , the asymmetry of the equilibrium magnetic field ) @xcite .",
    "a stability analysis can be considered as part of a bifurcation analysis , which will be provided for the cases of two as well as of three spatial dimensions in the present paper . in a bifurcation analysis one",
    "tries to determine the set of possible time - asymptotic states , the attractors , for given values of the system parameters .",
    "the bifurcations from a static sheet - pinch equilibrium have previously been studied for the case of two spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "grauer @xcite investigated the interaction of two different tearing modes in the two - dimensional slab geometry by reducing the dynamics at the bifurcation point to that on a four - dimensional center manifold .",
    "the new time - asymptotic states were found to be of the tearing - mode type , but e.g. also traveling waves were found .",
    "we note here that even though with increasing hartmann number the equilibrium becomes first unstable to two - dimensional perturbations ( according to the squire theorem ) , the new final states may be three - dimensional .",
    "this is one of the problems the present paper is addressed to .",
    "the first question arising is which type of two - dimensional ( 2d ) time - asymptotic state develops nonlinearly from the tearing mode when the whole problem is restricted to two spatial dimensions",
    ". the bifurcation studies @xcite predict steady states for the generic cases . similarly , large scale perturbations of a sheared magnetic field equilibrium were found to result in a final tearing - mode type stationary state via multiple coalescence of the magnetic island structures @xcite .",
    "a question coming up then is whether the 2d time - asymptotic states are stable with respect to three - dimensional perturbations .",
    "if not , how do the stability properties depend on parameters like the strength of a constant external magnetic field or the wavelength of perturbations in the invariant direction of the 2d state ?",
    "finally , what are the characteristic properties of the three - dimensional time - asymptotic states , when they manifest ? in the present paper for the first time a comprehensive stability analysis of the two - dimensional time - asymptotic states that develop from the tearing mode is presented .",
    "for the case of a spatially uniform resistivity these problems were addressed in numerical studies of the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations by dahlburg _",
    "@xcite , who found two - dimensional quasi - equilibria of the tearing - mode type to be unstable to three - dimensional perturbations .",
    "secondary three - dimensional instabilities were similarly observed for non - static primary states with , in addition to a sheared magnetic field , a pressure - driven jet - like flow @xcite , and their nonlinear development was proposed as a scenario for the transition to mhd turbulence .",

    "first the 2d results are discussed .",
    "after that we investigate the linear stability of 2d time - asymptotic states with respect to 3d perturbations . for appropriate choices of the external parameters the 2d states prove to be 3d unstable .",
    "the 3d asymptotics is investigated by a full three - dimensional long - time simulation of the pinch dynamics .",

    "we have numerically studied the primary and secondary bifurcations of an electrically driven plane sheet pinch with stress - free boundaries .",

    "we have calculated this state with precision for the aspect ratio @xmath71 and hartmann numbers close to the critical one .",
    "in contrast to the stability boundary the bifurcating new solutions may depend on the two reynolds - like numbers of the problem separately .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to @xmath142 .",
    "\\(2 ) the bifurcating steady ( time - asymptotic ) two - dimensional state was tested for stability with respect to three - dimensional perturbations .",
    "it proved to be unstable to 3d perturbations with a sufficiently large wavelength in the third direction . at the stability threshold always two identical real eigenvalues become positive ( i.e. , there are two purely growing unstable eigenmodes ) .",
    "we also added constant external magnetic field components along the invariant direction to the 2d tearing - mode equilibrium .",
    "if these components are sufficiently strong , they suppress the secondary instability with respect to three - dimensional perturbations , which is in accordance with the general expectation that a magnetic field impedes motions with gradients in the direction of the field and has been noted before @xcite .",
    "\\(3 ) full three - dimensional simulations were performed to follow the unstable 3d modes in their nonlinear evolution .",
    "the solution seems to converge to a 3d steady state .",
    "although velocity and magnetic field have now components in the invariant direction of the 2d state and all structures are modulated in this direction , there is still some resemblance to the 2d tearing mode state .",
    "this suggests , but does not prove , that the unstable 3d perturbations to the 2d state do not drive the system to a completely different region in phase space . 2d and 3d solutions might originate simultaneously in the primary bifurcation of the basic equilibrium .",
    "since our calculations were made very close to the primary bifurcation point , we suppose that the steady 2d tearing - mode state is unstable from the beginning and that there is a direct transition of the system from the quiescent basic state to three - dimensional attractors .",
    "this is true if the 2d state is not stabilized by an external magnetic field along its invariant direction .",
    "furthermore , a sufficiently small @xmath41 ensures stability of the 2d state in a certain hartmann number interval above the critical value ( since the unstable 3d perturbations , whose wavelength must exceed some threshold value , are then not admitted ) .",
    "finally , the aspect ratio @xmath40 and the magnetic prandtl number @xmath143 might influence the bifurcation scenario , possibly in such a way that in some parameter ranges the 2d tearing - mode solution bifurcates stably from the basic state .",
    "secondary instabilities that succeed primary two - dimensional ones and that lead to three - dimensionality have been considered as an important step in the transition from laminar to turbulent states in linearly unstable nonconducting shear flows @xcite . for the case of linearly stable shear flows ( e.g. the plane couette flow ) , it was suggested that nonlinear stationary and linearly unstable three - dimensional states , which develop already below the onset threshold of turbulence @xcite , can form a chaotic repellor in phase space @xcite .",
    "such a repellor can cause the transient turbulent states above the onset threshold .",
    "there is some analogy of the magnetohydrodynamic pinch to shear flows , and dahlburg _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have presented numerical evidence that the secondary instability of two - dimensional quasi - equilibria of the tearing - mode type can lead to turbulence in a plane sheet pinch . in their calculations",
    "the pinch was not driven by an external electric field ( nor mechanically driven ) and the electrical conductivity was assumed to be spatially uniform . in such a case the pinch always decays resistively , that is , velocity and magnetic field tend to zero as @xmath144 . by our choice of the resistivity profile and the applied electric field",

    "squire s theorem states that for increasing hartmann number two - dimensional perturbations to the quiescent basic state become unstable first . specifically : for each three - dimensional eigenmode with wave numbers @xmath65 , @xmath102 and growth rate @xmath145 at hartmann number @xmath0 , there exists a two - dimensional ( i.e. , @xmath38 invariant ) eigenmode with wave number @xmath146 and growth rate @xmath147 at hartmann number @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "if the stability problem is considered on the infinite @xmath37-@xmath38 plane , i.e. , with all wave numbers @xmath65 and @xmath102 allowed , for increasing @xmath0 one or several two - dimensional modes with a critical wave number @xmath150 ( and the corresponding critical wavelength @xmath151 ) become unstable at a critical hartmann number @xmath128 where all three - dimensional modes are still stable . above @xmath128 the critical value @xmath150 broadens to an unstable @xmath65 interval .",
    "the latter means , however , that three - dimensional modes could be unstable immediately above @xmath128 . namely , consider a 3d eigenmode with wave numbers @xmath65 , @xmath102 and growth rate @xmath145 at some hartmann number @xmath152 , @xmath153 .",
    "if @xmath65 is chosen from the interior of the unstable @xmath65 interval at @xmath0 , then @xmath146 lies within the unstable @xmath65 interval at the hartmann number @xmath148 , where @xmath154 , if only @xmath155 is chosen sufficiently small .",
    "this does not mean yet that the 2d mode to which the 3d mode is connected is unstable , since there are in general also stable 2d eigenmodes with the same wave number @xmath156 .",
    "but if the associated 2d mode is unstable , i.e. , if the real part of @xmath147 is positive , this implies that also @xmath157 .",
    "the possibility of unstable three - dimensional eigenmodes close to the critical hartmann number is excluded by the squire theorem , however , if @xmath41 is finite , i.e. , if there is a positive lower bound ( however small ) to the modulus of the wave number @xmath102 . in that case",
    "there is a finite hartmann number interval above @xmath128 where all unstable eigensolutions are purely two - dimensional .",
    "fixing @xmath40 to a finite value complicates the problem , since only a set of discrete values is admitted for @xmath65 .",
    "if not just @xmath158 , with @xmath159 denoting a positive integer number , that is , if @xmath150 is not just an admissible @xmath65 , instability to 2d modes will set in at some hartmann number @xmath75_{l_2}$ ] above @xmath128 and for a wave number @xmath160_{l_2}$ ] different from @xmath150 .      in the case",

    "it is easily seen that as in the case of @xmath149 ( i ) directly at the onset of instability only 2d modes can be unstable ( since modes with @xmath164 can not be unstable @xcite and the squire theorem thus would connect any unstable 3d mode to a 2d mode with wave number @xmath165_{l_2}$ ] outside the unstable @xmath65 interval at the hartmann number @xmath75_{l_2}$ ] ) , ( ii ) immediately above @xmath75_{l_2}$ ] also unstable 3d modes are possible ( or at least not forbidden by squire s theorem ) , ( iii ) a finite aspect ratio @xmath41 ( however large ) ensures that in a finite hartmann number interval close to the onset of instability only purely two - dimensional eigenmodes are unstable ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] where the pinch is stable with respect to 3d modes for @xmath166 ) .",
    "more involved is the situation for @xmath168 .",
    "then it can not be excluded generally that 3d modes become unstable first , and in principal each individual situation has to be tested separately .",
    "one can distinguish between the cases @xmath160_{l_2}>{k_2}_c$ ] and @xmath160_{l_2}<{k_2}_c$ ] , of which the first one is simpler . in both cases",
    "special complications arise from the fact that 3d modes with wave numbers @xmath65 smaller than @xmath160_{l_2}$ ] , that is to say , with @xmath169_{l_2}\\!=\\!n_0\\cdot2\\pi / l_2 $ ] ( @xmath159 , @xmath170 denoting integer numbers ) can come into play .    in the case of @xmath160_{l_2}>{k_2}_c$ ] these 3d modes ( with @xmath65 smaller than @xmath160_{l_2}$ ] ) are the only 3d modes that could become unstable at a hartmann number less than @xmath75_{l_2}$ ] ( where the first 2d mode becomes unstable ) ; if they remained stable , the situation is similar to subcase  [ s2a ] .",
    "the 3d modes with @xmath171 must remain stable close to the onset of 2d instability , however , if @xmath75_{l_2}$ ] does not exceed @xmath128 too much ( and @xmath160_{l_2}$ ] does not differ too much from @xmath150 ) , such that ( i ) @xmath155 has to be larger than some positive threshold value in order that @xmath146 ( with @xmath172 , @xmath173 ) can come into the unstable @xmath65 interval close to the onset of instability ( since there is a finite gap between the unstable @xmath65 interval and the largest admissible @xmath65 that is smaller than @xmath150 ) and ( ii ) as a consequence of this @xmath148 must be smaller than @xmath128 .",
    "if this is the case and , furthermore , @xmath160_{l_2}>{k_2}_c$ ] , the situation is the same as for @xmath174 .",
