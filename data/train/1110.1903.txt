    "a basic assumption in the collinear factorized parton model in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is the small intrinsic transverse momentum of initial partons inside beam hadrons or nuclei relative to both partons longitudinal momenta and the large energy - momentum scale @xmath5 involved in hard partonic interactions .",
    "to go beyond such a collinear factorized pqcd model , one has to expand the hard partonic part of the hard interaction in the intrinsic parton transverse momentum .",
    "in such an expansion , the first term gives rise to the normal collinear factorized pqcd results , known as the leading twist contributions which will depend on leading twist transverse - momentum - integrated parton distribution functions .",
    "the higher order terms in the taylor expansion can be combined together with contributions from multiple parton interaction between incoming or out - going partons and the remanent of target hadrons / nuclei .",
    "these contributions are known as higher twist contributions which can be expressed as the convolution of hard parts involving multiple parton scattering and multiple parton correlation functions inside the target hadrons / nuclei in the framework known as generalized collinear parton model @xcite .",
    "these higher - twist contributions in general are suppressed by powers of the momentum scale in the hard processes , @xmath6 .    in hard processes involving a large nuclear target , higher - twist contributions often depend on multiple parton correlation functions inside the target nucleus which are enhanced by the nuclear size @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these will give rise to a leading and non - trivial nuclear dependance of the higher - twist contributions to the hard processes beyond the incoherent superposition of nucleons inside a nucleus .",
    "one example of such nuclear enhanced higher - twist contributions is the suppression of leading hadron spectra in deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) off a nucleus relative to that in dis off a nucleon and the suppression is observed to increase with the nuclear size as in the hermes experiment @xcite .",
    "such a suppression has been studied within the generalized collinear parton model @xcite and was shown to be caused by multiple parton scattering of the struck quark and induced gluon radiation inside the target nucleus . the gluon radiation induced by multiple parton scattering that reduces the energy of the propagating quark",
    "can be expressed as a nuclear modification to the effective fragmentation function of the struck quark @xcite , which is determined by the quark - gluon correlation function inside the nucleus , a higher twist matrix element of the nucleus not calculable in pqcd . assuming a large and loosely bound nucleus",
    ", one can approximate these higher twist matrix elements as a product of initial quark distribution and gluon density distribution inside the nucleus , the latter is also known as the quark transport parameter inside the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "the parton transport parameter also describes the medium broadening of transverse momentum squared @xcite per unit distance and is equivalent to the saturation scale per unit length in a large nucleus @xcite .",
    "one can determine this quark transport parameter by comparing the leading hadron spectra suppression in dis off a nuclear target to experimental data .",
    "the predicted nuclear size and quark energy dependence of the hadron suppression agree very well with the experiment @xcite .",
    "one can further extend the study of medium modification of parton fragmentation functions and parton energy loss or jet quenching due to multiple parton scattering and induced gluon radiation to the case of parton propagation inside a hot quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy - ion collisions . in this case one",
    "has to replace the cold nuclei with a hot thermal medium of quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "the parton transport parameter is then proportional to gluon distribution density inside the hot qgp .",
    "therefore the study of jet quenching in high - energy heavy - ion collisions can provide crucial information of space - time profile of parton density distribution in the early stage of heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the observed suppression of single @xcite , dihadron spectra @xcite and gamma - hadron correlation @xcite in high - energy heavy - ion collisions at rhic are all consequences of strong jet quenching and provided the evidence for the formation of a strongly coupled qgp in the center of heavy - ion collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "recent data from heavy - ion collisions at the lhc @xcite have also shown a wide range of phenomena of jet quenching which point to the formation of a strongly coupled qgp similar to that formed in heavy - ion collisions at rhic .",
    "multiple scattering and induced parton energy loss have been studied in several theoretical frameworks @xcite , among which the higher - twist approach can be applied to jet propagation in both hot qgp and cold nuclei .",
    "in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , energetic partons which one uses as hard probes have to traverse not only the hot qgp in the early stage of the dense matter but also hadronic medium after hadronization of the qgp matter .",
    "one therefore has to include the effect of jet quenching due to multiple parton scattering during the hadronic phase of the dense matter evolution in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "using the information of parton energy loss in cold nuclei in dis off large nuclei and extrapolate to hadronic medium at finite temperature , a recent study @xcite finds non - negligible contribution from jet quenching in hadronic phase to the final suppression of large @xmath8 hadron spectra in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc .",
    "therefore , the study and inclusion of parton energy loss in cold nuclei and hadronic matter should be an integral part of phenomenological study of jet quenching in heavy - ion collisions .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the effect of multiple parton scattering and parton energy loss in the drell - yan ( dy ) process of dilepton production in @xmath0 collisions . since dilepton pairs in the final state do not have strong interaction with the target nucleus , only initial state interactions are important in dy process .",
    "therefore , it is an ideal tool to study fast parton propagation and energy loss in cold nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "the higher - twist approach has also been applied to the study of nuclear effects in the dy process in @xmath0 collisions @xcite .",
    "these studies were restricted to the large transverse momentum dy pairs , where one can neglect the interferences associated with induced gluon radiation . in the calculation of the total dy cross section",
    ", one has to integrate over the transverse momentum of the dy pairs and therefore has to take into account of the interferences .",
    "our approach to the nuclear effects in dy pair production in @xmath0 collisions is very similar to the study of nuclear modification of the effective fragmentation functions in dis .",
    "initial multiple parton scattering and induced gluon radiation before the dy pair production via quark - anti - quark annihilation can lead to parton energy loss and attenuation of the incoming beam partons . in the collinear approximation , transverse momentum of the initial partons",
    "are neglected .",
    "the transverse momentum of the final dy pairs is then determined by the transverse momentum of the radiated gluon either in the vacuum or medium induced gluon bremsstrahlung . in the process involving multiple parton scattering ,",
    "there are destructive interferences between the amplitudes of vacuum gluon bremsstrahlung and gluon radiation induced by multiple scattering .",
    "it is often referred to as the landau - pomercanchuk - migdal ( lpm ) interference @xcite .",
    "the lpm interference effect can be characterized by the formation time of the radiated gluon which is inversely proportional to the transverse momentum squared @xmath9 . for large @xmath9 or short formation time",
    ", interference between vacuum and medium induced gluon bremsstrahlung is negligible .",
    "however , for small @xmath9 , the gluon formation time becomes longer than or comparable to the nuclear size and there is strong destructive interference between vacuum and medium induced gluon bremsstrahlung that cancels the effect of gluon radiation due to multiple parton scattering . in our study of dy pair spectra",
    ", we will include explicitly the lpm interference within the framework higher - twist approach .",
    "similar to the parton energy loss and medium modification of the effective parton fragmentation functions in dis , we can express the nuclear effect in the dy process due to the initial multiple parton scattering and induced parton energy loss by the beam parton in terms of modified beam parton distribution functions .",
    "the medium modification can be effectively included in terms of the modified splitting functions in the qcd evolution equations which depend on twist-4 quark - gluon correlation functions inside the nucleus . with the approximation that the quark - gluon parton correlation can be factorized as a product of the quark and gluon distribution , the medium modified splitting functions depend only on the parton transport parameter @xmath10 , which is related to the distribution density of soft gluons inside the nucleus or the broadening of transverse momentum squared per unit length due to multiple scattering .",
    "this is the only free parameter in the higher - twist study in both dis and dy process with a nucleus target .",
    "one therefore can use the information from the phenomenological study of hadron suppression in dis experiment @xcite and calculate the nuclear suppression due to parton energy loss in the dy process @xcite .",
    "coherence in multiple scattering between beam and target partons can also lead to the nuclear shadowing of parton distributions inside the target nucleus .",
    "this and other nuclear modifications of the parton distributions has been measured in nuclear dis @xcite and parametrized @xcite from global fitting of experimental data involving nuclear targets .",
    "these nuclear modifications of parton distributions can also lead to nuclear effects in dy spectra in @xmath0 versus that in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "we will use the eps08 parameterization @xcite of the nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdf ) for the target nucleus in the calculation of dy spectra in addition to the effect of parton energy loss and medium modification of the beam parton distributions .",
    "we will then compare the calculated dy spectra to the data from the fermilab experiment 866 ( e866 ) @xcite .",
    "we will compare the effect of nuclear shadowing of target partons and the beam parton energy loss and investigate in which kinetic region the effect of beam parton energy loss dominate .",
