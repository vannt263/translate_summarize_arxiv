    "let @xmath1 be a dirac manifold .",
    "if a lie group @xmath0 acts on @xmath6 by dirac automorphisms , in a proper and free fashion , one may hope that @xmath3 inherits a dirac structure from @xmath6 .",
    "however , this is not true as can be seen by simple examples of dirac structures associated with closed 2-forms .",
    "one needs to impose extra conditions .",
    "consider the map @xmath7 which to a pair @xmath8 associates @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the infinitesimal generator associated with @xmath11 .",
    "this map is a lie algebroid morphism whenever the action is by dirac automorphisms .",
    "we call a dirac action * regular * if @xmath12 is fiberwise surjective , in which case it follows that there is an induced dirac structure on the quotient @xmath3 such that @xmath13 .",
    "it is then natural to ask if the quotient @xmath14 is integrable whenever @xmath1 is integrable .",
    "this is indeed the case since one has the following result :    [ thm : integration : dirac ] let @xmath1 be an integrable dirac manifold and assume that @xmath0 acts on @xmath6 by dirac automorphisms .",
    "if the action is regular , proper and free , then @xmath14 is an integrable dirac structure .",
    "this result , on the one hand , generalizes a result in @xcite for the case of poisson manifolds . on the other hand , it is a special case of a result proved in @xcite for more general actions . here",
    "we consider only the case of regular actions , since they suffice for our main object of study : hamiltonian actions .",
    "an integration of the quotient dirac manifold @xmath14 can be described as follows : if @xmath15 is the weinstein groupoid of @xmath1 , the @xmath0-action on @xmath1 lifts to a proper and free hamiltonian @xmath0-action on @xmath16 , by groupoid automorphisms , with moment map the unique groupoid morphism @xmath17 such that @xmath18 .",
    "the regularity assumption guarantees that @xmath19 is indeed a regular value of @xmath20 so that the hamiltonian quotient @xmath21 is a presymplectic groupoid integrating @xmath3 .",
    "briefly , @xmath22 integrates @xmath3 .",
    "let us now turn to our main object of study . by a * hamiltonian action",
    "* we mean a smooth action of a connected lie group @xmath0 on the dirac manifold @xmath1 for which there is a @xmath0-equivariant map @xmath23 satisfying the * moment map * condition : @xmath24 here @xmath25 denotes the function @xmath26 .",
    "we call the quadruple @xmath27 a * hamiltonian @xmath0-space*.    it is easy to give simple examples of proper and free hamiltonian actions for which the dirac structure on @xmath6 does not descend to the quotient @xmath3 .",
    "so one needs some regularity condition on the moment map for this to happen . recall that we can think of @xmath1 as a ( possible singular ) foliation of @xmath6 by presymplectic leaves",
    "it is easy to see that a hamiltonian action is always tangent to the leaves and on each leaf @xmath28 the usual moment map condition holds : @xmath29 we shall say that the * moment map is regular at @xmath30 * if @xmath31 is a regular value of the restriction @xmath32 , for every presymplectic leaf @xmath28 .",
    "note that this implies that @xmath31 is a regular value of @xmath33 , in the usual sense , but the converse , in general , does not hold .",
    "we will say that the * moment map is regular * if it is regular at all @xmath30 .",
    "it turns out that the moment map of a hamiltonian action is regular if and only if the dirac action is regular , and then one has hamiltonian reduction of dirac structures in the following form :    [ thm : dirac : ham : reduction ] let @xmath27 be a hamiltonian @xmath0-space and assume that the moment map is regular",
    ". if the action is proper and free , then there are unique dirac structures on @xmath3 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 such that for the maps @xmath36^\\pi & \\\\ \\mu^{-1}(c)\\ar[ur]^{i_c}\\ar[dr]_{\\pi_c } &      & m / g\\\\ & m{\\ensuremath{/\\mkern-5mu/}}g   \\ar[ur]_i } \\ ] ] one has @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "particular cases of this result can be found in the work of blankenstein and van der schaft @xcite , with assumptions that seem to be superfluous .",
    "this result should also follow from the general results on reduction of courant algebroids and dirac structures described by bursztyn , cavalcanti and gualtieri @xcite and the results on the so called optimal moment map described in jotz and ratiu @xcite .",
    "since we could not find this exact statement in the literature , we have included a direct proof of it in section [ sec : dirac ] below .",
    "assume now that @xmath27 is a hamiltonian @xmath0-space and that @xmath1 is an integrable dirac structure , so that its weinstein groupoid @xmath16 is a presymplectic groupoid integrating @xmath1 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we will se that we have a lifted @xmath0 action on @xmath16 which is hamiltonian with moment map @xmath17 given by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the source and target maps of @xmath42 .",
    "note that the moment map @xmath20 is still the integration of the lie algebroid morphism @xmath7 .",
    "hence the regularity condition on the moment map guarantees that @xmath19 is a regular value of @xmath20 and we have the following corollary of theorem [ thm : integration : dirac ] :    [ cor : integ : dirac : quotient ] let @xmath27 be a hamiltonian @xmath0-space and assume that @xmath1 is integrable .",
    "if the action is proper and free and the moment map is regular then the quotient @xmath3 is integrable and the hamiltonian quotient @xmath43 is a presymplectic groupoid integrating @xmath14 .    given a hamiltonian @xmath0-space @xmath27 , corollary [ cor : integ : dirac : quotient ] shows that the quotient @xmath14 is integrable provided @xmath1 is integrable and the action is proper , free and regular .",
    "we will give an example below which shows that , in general , the hamiltonian quotient @xmath44 is not an integrable dirac structure , even if @xmath1 is integrable .",
    "however , the obstructions to the integrability of @xmath45 can be determined explicitly .",
    "we introduce for each @xmath46 a certain group morphism , called the * @xmath0-monodromy morphism * : @xmath47 whose image @xmath48 we call the * @xmath0-monodromy group * at @xmath49 of the action .",
    "these groups control the integrability of @xmath45 .",
    "more precisely , set @xmath50 then we have :    [ thm : integ : ham : quotient ] let @xmath27 be a hamiltonian @xmath0-space and assume that @xmath1 is integrable .",
    "if the action is proper and free and the moment map is regular , then @xmath44 is an integrable dirac structure if and only if @xmath51 is an embedded lie subgroupoid .",
    "the obstructions clearly vanish if @xmath0 has a finite fundamental group .",
    "other conditions for vanishing of the obstructions can be obtain from the description of the @xmath0-monodromy morphism .",
    "we provide a nice geometric description of this morphism when a presymplectic leaf is regular , in terms of variations of the presymplectic areas of disks whose boundary is an orbit of a closed loop in @xmath0 .",
    "when the obstructions vanish we can describe one presymplectic groupoid integrating @xmath44 as follows : upon restricting to an appropriate neighborhood of @xmath4 , we can assume that @xmath52 is an embedded lie subgroupoid .",
    "then the quotient @xmath53 is a presymplectic lie groupoid integrating @xmath1 and there is a @xmath54 action on @xmath55 which is hamiltonian with moment map @xmath56 , given by : @xmath57 this action is proper and free , and @xmath19 is a regular value of @xmath58 .",
    "it follows that the hamiltonian quotient @xmath59 is well defined and it is in fact a presymplectic groupoid integrating @xmath45 .",
    "our results can be summarized in the following table :    -.83 in    -.75 in [ results ]    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : dirac ] , we review the basics of dirac structures and their symmetry reduction , proving theorem [ thm : dirac : ham : reduction ] . in section [ sec : dirac : quotients ] , we study the integrability of dirac quotients @xmath3 , and we give a direct proof of theorem [ thm : integration : dirac ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : ham : quotients ] we introduce the @xmath0-monodromy morphism and we show that they give the obstructions to the integrability of hamiltonian quotients , proving theorem [ thm : integ : ham : quotient ] .",
    "we also give an example of hamiltonian quotient which is non - integrable .",
    "10 pt    * acknowledgements . * we would like to thank henrique bursztyn and david iglesias - ponte for several comments and remarks on a preliminary version of this paper .",
    "in this section we will state and give short proofs of some results concerning reduction of dirac structures , that we use in this paper and for which we could not find references in the literature .",
    "particular cases of the results stated here can be found in the work of blankenstein and van der schaft @xcite , with assumptions that seem to be superfluous .",
    "the results stated here should also follow from the general results on reduction of courant algebroids and dirac structures described by bursztyn , cavalcanti and gualtieri @xcite and the results on the so called optimal moment map described in jotz and ratiu @xcite .",
    "let us start by recalling the definition of dirac structures , mainly to fix notations and sign conventions . recall that dirac structures were introduced by t.  courant in @xcite as geometric structures generalizing both poisson structures and presymplectic structures .",
    "dirac structures on a manifold @xmath6 are described by certain subundles of the generalized tangent bundle @xmath60 .",
    "this bundle comes equipped with natural pairings @xmath61 on its space of sections @xmath62 , defined by : @xmath63 the space of sections of @xmath64 also carries a skew - symmetric bracket called the * courant bracket * @xcite , which is given by : @xmath65,\\operatorname{\\mathcal{l}}_x{\\beta}-\\operatorname{\\mathcal{l}}_y{\\alpha}+{\\mathrm d}\\langle ( x,{\\alpha}),(y,{\\beta})\\rangle_-\\bigr)\\ ] ] in general , this bracket _ does not _ satisfy the jacobi identity .",
    "let @xmath66 be a subundle .",
    "we say that :    a.   @xmath67 is an * almost dirac structure * on @xmath6 if it is maximal isotropic with respect to @xmath68 , b.   @xmath67 is a * dirac structure * on @xmath6 if it is an almost dirac structure and @xmath69 is closed under the bracket @xmath70 .    for a dirac structure @xmath67 , the restriction of the bracket @xmath70 to @xmath69 yields a lie bracket and if we let @xmath71 be the restriction of the projection to @xmath72 , then @xmath73 defines a lie algebroid .",
    "each leaf of the corresponding characteristic foliation ( obtained by integrating the singular distribution @xmath74 ) carries a pre - symplectic form @xmath75 : if @xmath76 , we can choose @xmath77 such that @xmath78 and set : @xmath79 one can check that this definition is independent of choices and that @xmath75 is indeed closed .",
    "thus we may think of a dirac manifold as a ( singular ) foliated manifold by pre - symplectic leaves .    for dirac structures ,",
    "there are two types of maps : forward dirac maps and backward dirac maps ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we recall here the definitions :    if @xmath80 is a smooth map between dirac manifolds .",
    "then :    a.   @xmath81 is called a * forward dirac map * or simply a * f - dirac map * , if : @xmath82 b.   @xmath81 is called a * backward dirac map * or simply a * b - dirac map * , if : @xmath83    for a general map @xmath84 these two conditions are distinct . however , for a diffeomorphism these two conditions are equivalent and when they hold we call @xmath81 a * dirac diffeomorphism*.    let us denote by @xmath85 the group of dirac automorphisms of a dirac manifold @xmath1 .",
    "we will say that @xmath86 is a * dirac vector field * if its flow @xmath87 is a 1-parameter group of dirac diffeomorphisms .",
    "its is easy to see that this happens iff @xmath88 it is clear the space of dirac vector fields is closed under the usual lie bracket of vector fields , and hence form a lie subalgebra @xmath89 .",
    "we should think of @xmath90 as the lie algebra of the ( infinite dimensional ) lie group @xmath85 .",
    "the symmetry group of dirac structures include , besides the dirac diffeomorphisms , the * gauge transformations * or * @xmath91-transforms * : given a dirac structure @xmath1 and a closed 2-form @xmath92 one defines the @xmath91-transform of @xmath67 to be the dirac structure : @xmath93 it follows that the semi - direct product @xmath94 acts on the space of dirac structures on m. here , two pairs @xmath95 compose as : @xmath96    let us recall some of the main examples of dirac structures .",
    "[ ex : dirac:2-forms ] a 2-form @xmath97 defines an almost dirac structure : @xmath98 @xmath99 is a dirac structure if and only if @xmath75 is closed .",
    "this dirac structure is characterized by the fact that it has only one presymplectic leaf .",
    "the effect of a @xmath91-transform on @xmath99 is to change it to @xmath100 .",
    "[ ex : dirac : poisson ] a bi - vector @xmath101 defines an almost dirac structure : @xmath102 @xmath103 is a dirac structure if and only if @xmath104=0 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath105 is a poisson structure . in this case , the presymplectic leaves are in fact symplectic , and we recover the symplectic foliation of a poisson manifold .",
    "a @xmath91-transform on @xmath103 produces a new dirac structure with the same underlying foliation , but where the 2-form @xmath106 on a leaf @xmath107 is changed to @xmath108 ( which may or may not be symplectic , so @xmath109 mail fail to be poisson ) .",
    "[ ex : dirac : foliations ] let @xmath110 be a distribution .",
    "then @xmath111 together with its annihilator defines an almost dirac structure : @xmath112 @xmath113 is a dirac structure if and only if @xmath111 is an integrable distribution : @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is a regular foliation . in this case",
    ", @xmath116 is a dirac structure whose presymplectic foliation is @xmath115 itself , where the leaves have zero presymplectic forms .",
    "a @xmath91-transform has the effect of adding to the leaves a pre - symplectic form , namely the restriction of @xmath91 to each leaf .",
    "we can also combine all the constructions above as follows : let @xmath110 be a distribution , let @xmath97 be a 2-form and let @xmath101 be a bi - vector field . if @xmath117 , then : @xmath118 defines an almost dirac structure . if @xmath111 is integrable , @xmath75 is closed and @xmath105 is poisson , then @xmath67 is a dirac structure .",
    "let @xmath0 be a lie group acting on a dirac manifold @xmath1 .",
    "we denote by @xmath119 the infinitesimal generator associated with an element in the lie algebra @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath0 acts by dirac diffeomorphisms on @xmath1 we will call the action a * dirac action*. from the discussion in the previous paragraph it is clear what is the infinitesimal version of a dirac action :    for a dirac action of @xmath0 on @xmath1 : @xmath120 conversely , if @xmath0 is a connected lie group and this condition holds then @xmath0 acts by dirac diffeomorphisms on @xmath1 .",
    "there is another useful way of translating the infinitesimal condition for @xmath0 to act by dirac automorphisms .",
    "for that , given any action of @xmath0 on @xmath1 we will denote by @xmath7 the map : @xmath121 then :    let @xmath0 act on @xmath1 .",
    "then holds if and only if @xmath7 is a lie algebroid morphism ( where @xmath122 is considered as an abelian lie algebra ) .",
    "the map @xmath12 is a lie algebroid morphism if and only if it commutes with the lie algebroid differentials : @xmath123 and it is enough to check this condition in degrees @xmath19 and @xmath124 .",
    "since @xmath122 is a lie algebroid over @xmath125 this condition is trivial in degree @xmath19 . on the other hand , in degree @xmath124 ,",
    "given @xmath11 we view it as 1-form @xmath126 , and a straightforward computation gives : @xmath127 for all @xmath128 .",
    "so @xmath12 is a lie algebroid morphism if and only if holds .",
    "the morphism @xmath7 is a kind of moment map .",
    "in fact , in the case where @xmath67 is the dirac structure associated with a poisson structure , we have @xmath129 , and @xmath12 is precisely the moment map for the cotangent lift of the action .",
    "another facet of this , which we will discuss later , happens when @xmath1 is integrable , in which case @xmath12 is the infinitesimal version of a moment map @xmath130 defined on the presymplectic groupoid integrating @xmath1 .",
    "given a dirac action of @xmath0 on @xmath1 which is proper and free , so that @xmath3 is a smooth manifold , we may ask if there exists a dirac structure @xmath131 such that the quotient map @xmath132 if an @xmath133-dirac map . at each point",
    "@xmath134\\in m / g$ ] the fiber of @xmath131 is completely determined by the condition that @xmath135 is f - dirac : @xmath136}:=\\pi_*l|_{[p ] } = \\{({\\mathrm d}_p\\pi\\cdot x,{\\alpha})\\in { \\mathbb{t}}_{[p]}m / g : ( x,({\\mathrm d}_p\\pi)^*{\\alpha})\\in l|_p\\}.\\ ] ] each of these vector spaces are maximal isotropic in @xmath137 .",
    "if they form a smooth vector bundle then we obtain an almost dirac structure which is automatically integrable .",
    "so the only issue about reduction of dirac structures under symmetry is whether is a smooth bundle .",
    "[ ex : discrete ] if @xmath0 is a discrete lie group that acts properly and freely on @xmath1 then the dirac structure is always reducible : @xmath138 is a local diffeomorphism so it is clear that is a smooth bundle .",
    "if @xmath105 is a poisson structure in @xmath6 which is invariant under a proper and free action of a lie group @xmath0 , then there is an induced poisson structure @xmath139 in @xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds in dirac language to the fact that the dirac structure @xmath140 is @xmath0-invariant , it is always reducible , and the quotient is still given by a poisson structure .",
    "although dirac structures associated with poisson structures are always reducible , this is not the case with our types of dirac structures as it is illustrated by the following simple example .",
    "let @xmath141 and let @xmath142 be the dirac structure associated with the 1-dimensional distribution @xmath143 .",
    "the action of @xmath144 on @xmath145 by translations in the @xmath146-direction is dirac .",
    "the projection of @xmath113 along @xmath147 , @xmath148 , is : @xmath149 which is clearly not a smooth subundle .    in the previous example",
    ", the action moves a leaf to a different leaf .",
    "it is easy to see that for dirac structures associated with an integrable distribution @xmath113 , the dirac structure is reducible whenever the action is tangent the leaves .",
    "our next example shows that for dirac structures associated with closed 2-forms @xmath99 , the dirac structure may fail to be reducible , even if the action is tangent to the leaves .",
    "[ ex : hamiltonian : singular ] let @xmath141 with the dirac structure @xmath99 associated with the closed 2-form @xmath150 . again , the action of @xmath144 on @xmath145 by translations in the @xmath146-direction is dirac .",
    "the projection of @xmath99 along @xmath147 , @xmath148 , is : @xmath151 which is clearly not a smooth subundle .",
    "next we study a natural condition that guarantees that a dirac structure is reducible .",
    "[ defn : regular ] a dirac action of @xmath0 on @xmath1 is called a * regular dirac action * if @xmath7 is fiberwise surjective .",
    "this condition is reminiscent of the usual regularity condition for a moment map , and we will return to this idea later when we study hamiltonian actions and integrability .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that a regular dirac action is always locally free .",
    "when a regular action is proper and free we obtain :    [ prop : dirac : reducible ] let @xmath0 act on @xmath1 and assume that the action is a regular dirac action which is proper and free",

    "it follows from example [ ex : discrete ] that we can assume that @xmath0 is a connected lie group .    in order to prove that @xmath152 , given by , is a smooth bundle we observe that the regularity assumption implies that @xmath153 is a subundle .",
    "now observe that the action of @xmath0 on @xmath64 leaves this subundle invariant , and it follows from , that we have a @xmath0-invariant surjective bundle map : @xmath154\\ar[d ] & \\pi_*l\\ar[d]\\\\ m\\ar[r ] & m / g}\\ ] ] by passing to quotient , we obtain an isomorphisms @xmath155 , therefore showing that @xmath156 is a smooth bundle .",
    "this proves that there exist a unique dirac structure @xmath131 such that the quotient map @xmath157 is f - dirac .",
    "the regularity condition is sufficient , but not necessary , to guarantee that @xmath67 is reducible : for any proper and free action on a manifold equipped with the zero 2-form @xmath158 , the dirac structure @xmath99 is reducible , while the map @xmath12 is identically zero .",
    "however , the regularity condition is sufficient for us and , in particular , to deal with hamiltonian actions to which we turn next .",

    "we have added the assumption that @xmath0 acts by dirac automorphisms since the group @xmath0 may fail to be connected .",

    "proper and free hamiltonian actions may fail to be reducible .",
    "the action in example [ ex : hamiltonian : singular ] is hamiltonian with moment map @xmath162 given by @xmath163 , but is not reducible .",
    "the problem with the previous example is that 0 is not a regular value of the moment map . for a general hamiltonian action",
