    "in 1929 carnegie astronomer , edwin hubble , published a linear correlation between the apparent distances to galaxies and their recessional velocities . this simple plot provided evidence that our universe is in a state of expansion , a discovery that still stands as one the most profound of the twentieth century ( hubble 1929a ) .",
    "this result had been anticipated earlier by lematre ( 1927 ) , who first provided a mathematical solution for an expanding universe , and noted that it provided a natural explanation for the observed receding velocities of galaxies .",
    "these results were published in the annals of the scientific society of brussels ( in french ) , and were not widely known .    using photographic data obtained at the 100-inch hooker telescope situated at mount wilson ca , hubble measured the distances to six galaxies in the local group using the period - luminosity relation ( hereafter , the leavitt law ) for cepheid variables .",
    "he then extended the sample to an additional 18 galaxies reaching as far as the virgo cluster , assuming a constant upper limit to the brightest blue stars ( hii regions ) in these galaxies . combining these distances with published radial velocity measurements ( corrected for solar motion ) hubble constructed figure 1 .",
    "the slope of the velocity versus distance relation yields the hubble constant , which parameterizes the current expansion rate of the universe .",
    "the hubble constant is usually expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec , and sets the cosmic distance scale for the present universe .",
    "the inverse of the hubble constant has dimensions of time .",
    "locally , the hubble law relates the distance to an object and its redshift : cz = h@xmath2d , where d is the distance to the object and z is its redshift .",
    "the hubble law relating the distance and the redshift holds in any friedman - lemaitre - robertson - walker cosmology ( see  [ sec : cosmology ] ) for redshifts less than unity . at greater redshifts , the distance - redshift relationship for such",
    "a cosmology also depends on the energy densities of matter and dark energy . the exact relation between the expansion age and the hubble",
    "constant depends on the nature of the mass - energy content of the universe , as discussed further in ",
    "[ sec : cosmology ] and  [ sec : age ] . in a uniformly expanding universe ,",
    "the hubble parameter , h(t ) , changes as a function of time ; h@xmath3 , referred to as the hubble constant , is the value at the current time , @xmath4 .",
    "measurement of the hubble constant has been an active subject since hubble s original measurements of the distances to galaxies : the deceptively simple correlation between galaxy distance and recession velocity discovered eighty years ago did not foreshadow how much of a challenge large systematic uncertainties would pose in obtaining an accurate value for the hubble constant .",
    "only recently have improvements in linear , solid - state detectors , the launch of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , and the development of several different methods for measuring distances led to a convergence on its current value .",
    "determining an accurate value for h@xmath5 was one of the primary motivations for building hst . in the early 1980 s ,",
    "the first director of the space telescope science institute , riccardo giacconi , convened a series of panels to propose observational programs of significant impact requiring large amounts of hubble observations .",
    "he was concerned that in the course of any regular time allocation process there would be reluctance to set aside sufficient time to complete such large projects in a timely manner . for decades a ` factor - of - two ' controversy persisted , with values of the hubble constant falling between 50 and 100 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 .",
    "a goal of 10% accuracy for h@xmath5 was designated as one of hst s three `` key projects '' .",
    "( the other two were a study of the intergalactic medium using quasar absorption lines , and a `` medium - deep '' survey of galaxies . )",
    "this review is organized as follows : we first give a brief overview of the cosmological context for measurements of the hubble constant .",
    "we discuss in some detail methods for measuring distances to galaxies , specifically cepheids , the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) , masers , the tully - fisher relation and type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) .",
    "we then turn to a discussion of h@xmath5 , its systematic uncertainties , other methods for measuring h@xmath5 , and future measurements of the hubble constant .",
    "our goal is to describe the recent developments that have resulted in a convergence to better than 10% accuracy in measurements of the hubble constant , and to outline how future data can improve this accuracy . for wide - ranging previous reviews of this subject",

    "the expansion of a homogeneous and isotropic universe can be described by a friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology , which is characterized by parameters that describe the expansion , the global geometry , and the general composition of the universe .",
    "these parameters are all related via the friedmann equation , derived from the einstein general relativity field equations : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the expansion rate , g is the newtonian gravitational constant , @xmath8 is the cosmic scale factor characterizing the relative size of the universe at time @xmath9 to the present scale , @xmath10 are the individual components of the matter - energy density , and @xmath11 ( with values of + 1 , 0 , or -1 ) describes the global geometry of the universe .",
    "the density @xmath12 characterizes the matter - energy composition of the universe : the sum of the densities of baryons , cold dark matter , and hot dark matter , and the contribution from dark energy .",

    ", the expansion velocity of the universe slows down over time owing to the attractive force of gravity .",
    "however , a decade ago two independent groups ( perlmutter et al . 1999 ; riess et al .",
    "1998 ) found that supernovae at z@xmath170.5 appear to be about 10% fainter than those observed locally , consistent instead with models in which the expansion velocity is increasing ; i.e. , a universe that is accelerating in its expansion . combined with independent estimates of the matter density ,",
    "these results are consistent with a universe in which one third of the overall density is in the form of matter ( ordinary plus dark ) , and two thirds is in a form having a large , negative pressure , termed dark energy . in this current standard model the expansion rate of the universe is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 refer to the densities of ( ordinary , cold and hot dark ) matter and dark energy , respectively , and @xmath21 is the equation of state of the dark energy , the ratio of pressure to energy density .",
    "recent observations by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) , based on entirely independent physics , give results consistent with the supernova data ( komatsu et al .",
    "2009 ; dunkley et al .",
    "2009 ) . under the assumption of a flat universe , the current observations of distant supernovae and measurements by the wmap satellite are consistent with a cosmological model where",
    "@xmath19 = 0.3 , @xmath22 = 0.7 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the observations are inconsistent with cosmological models without dark energy .",
    "another critical equation from general relativity involving the second derivative of the scale factor is : @xmath24 where the sum is over the different contributions to the mass - energy density of the universe . according to this equation ,",
    "both energy and pressure govern the dynamics of the universe , unlike the case of newtonian gravity where there is no pressure term .",
    "it also allows the possibility of negative pressure , resulting in an effective repulsive gravity , consistent with the observations of the acceleration .",
    "any component of the mass - energy density can be parameterized by its ratio of pressure to energy density , @xmath25 . for ordinary matter @xmath25 = 0 , for radiation @xmath25 = 1/3 , and for the cosmological constant @xmath25 = -1 .",
    "the effect on @xmath26 of an individual component is -4@xmath27 . if @xmath28 that component will drive an acceleration ( positive @xmath29 ) of the universe .",
    "the time evolution of the equation of state is unknown ; a convenient , simple parameterization is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 characterizes the current value of @xmath25 and @xmath32 its derivative .",
    "in making measurements of extragalactic distances , objects are being observed at a time when the scale factor of the universe , @xmath33 , was smaller , and the age of the universe , @xmath9 , was younger than at present . measuring",
    "the cosmic expansion generally involves use of one of two types of cosmological distances : the luminosity distance , @xmath34 which relates the observed flux ( integrated over all frequencies ) , @xmath35 , of an object to its intrinsic luminosity , @xmath36 , emitted in its rest frame ; and the angular diameter distance , @xmath37 which relates the apparent angular size of an object in radians , @xmath38 , to its proper size , @xmath39 .",
    "the luminosity and angular diameter distances are related by : @xmath40 the distance modulus , @xmath41 , is related to the luminosity distance as follows : @xmath42 where m and m are the apparent and absolute magnitudes of the objects , respectively , and d@xmath43 is in units of parsecs .",
    "the requirements for measuring an accurate value of h@xmath5 are simple to list in principle , but are extremely difficult to meet in practice .",
    "the measurement of radial velocities from the displacement of spectral lines is straightforward ; the challenge is to measure accurate distances .",
    "distance measurements must be obtained far enough away to probe the smooth hubble expansion ( i.e. , where the random velocities induced by gravitational interactions with neighboring galaxies are small relative to the hubble velocity ) , and nearby enough to calibrate the absolute , not simply the relative distance scale .",
    "the objects under study also need to be sufficiently abundant that their statistical uncertainties do not dominate the error budget .",
    "ideally the method has a solid physical underpinning , and is established to have high internal accuracy , amenable to empirical tests for systematic errors .",
    "we discuss in detail here three high - precision methods for measuring distances to nearby galaxies : cepheids , the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) method , and maser galaxies . for more distant galaxies",
    ", we will additionally discuss three methods in detail : the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation for spiral galaxies , the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method and the maximum luminosities of type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) .",
    "although maser distances have so far only been published for two galaxies ( ngc  4258 and ugc  3789 ) , this method has considerable potential , perhaps even at distances that probe the hubble flow directly .    over the preceding decades a large number of other `` distance indicators '' have been explored and applied with varying degrees of success , often over relatively restricted ranges of distance .",
    "main sequence fitting , red giant `` clump '' stars , rr lyrae stars , the level of the horizontal branch , mira variables , novae and planetary nebula luminosity functions ( pnlf ) , globular cluster luminosity functions ( gclf ) , as well as red and blue supergiant stars all fall into this class . some , like the rr lyrae stars , have provided crucial tests for consistency of zero points but can not themselves reach very far beyond the local group because of their relatively faint intrinsic luminosities .",
    "the reader is referred to recent papers on the sn ii distance scale ( dessart & hiller 2005 ) ; pnlf ( ciardullo et al . 2002 ) ; and fundamental plane ( fp ; blakeslee et al . 2002 ) and references therein .",
    "our goal here is not to provide an exhaustive review of all distance determination methods , but rather to focus on a few methods with demonstrably low dispersion , some currently understood physical basis , and with sufficient overlap with other methods to test quantitatively the accuracy of the calibration , and level of systematic errors for the determination of h@xmath5 . before turning to a discussion of methods for measuring distances",
    ", we discuss the general issue of interstellar extinction .",
    "interstellar extinction will systematically decrease a star or galaxy s apparent luminosity .",
    "thus , if extinction is not corrected for it will result in a derivation of distance that is systematically too large . dust may be present along the line of sight either within our milky way galaxy and/or along the same extended line of sight within the galaxy under study .",
    "two main observational paths to correct for interstellar extinction have been pursued : ( 1 ) make observations in at least two wavelength bands and , using the fact that extinction is a known function of wavelength to solve explicitly for the distance and color - excess / extinction effects , or ( 2 ) observe at the longest wavelengths practical so as to minimize implicitly the extinction effects .",
    "the former assumes prior knowledge of the interstellar extinction law and carries the implicit assumption that the extinction law is universal .",
    "the latter path is conceptually more robust , given that it simply makes use of the ( empirically - established ) fact that extinction decreases with increasing wavelength .",
    "however , working at longer and longer wavelengths has been technically more challenging so this path has taken longer in coming to fruition .    from studies of galactic o & b stars it is well - established that interstellar extinction is wavelength dependent , and from the optical to mid - infrared wavelengths it is a generally decreasing function of increasing wavelength ( see cardelli , clayton & mathis 1996 ; draine et al . 2003 and references therein for empirical and theoretical considerations ) .",
    "limited studies of stars in external galaxies ( primarily the lmc and smc ) support this view , with major departures being confined to the ultraviolet region of the spectrum ( particularly near 2200 ) . both for practical reasons ( that is , detector sensitivity ) and because of the nature of interstellar extinction , the majority of distance - scale applications have avoided the ultraviolet , so the most blatant changes in the interstellar extinction curve have been of little practical concern . at another extreme , the universality of the longer - wavelength ( optical through infrared ) portion of the extinction curve appears to break down in regions of intense star formation and extremely high optical depths within the milky way .",
    "however , the general ( diffuse ) interstellar extinction curve , as parameterized by ratios of total - to - selective absorption , such as @xmath44 = @xmath45 , appears to be much more stable from region to region .",
    "fortunately cepheids , trgb stars , and supernovae are generally not found deeply embedded in very high optical - depth dust , but are sufficiently displaced from their original sites of star formation that they are dimmed mostly by the general , diffuse interstellar extinction .      since the discovery of the leavitt law ( leavitt , 1908 ; leavitt & pickering 1912 ) and its use by hubble to measure the distances to the local group galaxies , ngc 6822 ( hubble 1925 ) , m33 ( hubble 1926 ) and m31 ( hubble 1929b )",
    ", cepheid variables have remained a widely applicable and powerful method for measuring distances to nearby galaxies . in 2009 ,",
    "the american astronomical society council passed a resolution recognizing the 100th anniversary of henrietta leavitt s first presentation of the cepheid period - luminosity relation ( leavitt 1908 ) .",
    "the council noted that it was pleased to learn of a resolution adopted by the organizers of the leavitt symposium , held in november , 2008 at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics , cambridge , ma .",
    "there , it was suggested that the cepheid period - luminosity relation be referred to as the leavitt law in recognition of leavitt s fundamental discovery , and we do so here .",
    "cepheids are observed to pulsate with periods ranging from 2 to over 100 days , and their intrinsic brightnesses correlate with those periods , ranging from -2 @xmath46 m@xmath47 @xmath46 -6  mag .",
    "the ease of discovery and identification of these bright , variable supergiants make them powerful distance indicators .",
    "detailed reviews of the cepheid distance scale and its calibration can be found in madore & freedman ( 1991 ) , sandage & tammann ( 2006 ) , fouque et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and barnes ( 2009 ) .",
    "a review of the history of the subject is given by fernie ( 1969 ) .",
    "there are many steps that must be taken in applying cepheids to the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "the cepheids must be identified against the background of fainter , resolved and unresolved stars that contribute to the surrounding light of the host galaxy .",
    "overcoming crowding and confusion is the key to the successful discovery , measurement and use of cepheids in galaxies beyond the local group . from the ground",
    ", atmospheric turbulence degrades the image resolution , decreasing the contrast of point sources against the background . in space",
    "the resolution limit is set by the aperture of the telescope and the operating wavelengths of the detectors .",
    "hst gives a factor of ten increased resolution over most groundbased telescopes of comparable and larger aperture .",
    "as higher precision data have been accumulated for cepheids in greater numbers and in different physical environments , it has become possible to search for and investigate a variety of lower level , but increasingly important , systematics affecting the leavitt law .",
    "below we briefly discuss these complicating effects ( reddening and metallicity , in specific ) and their uncertainties , and quantify their impact on the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "we then elaborate on methods for correcting for and/or mitigating their impact on distance determinations .",
    "but first we give an overview of the physical basis for the cepheid period - luminosity relation in general terms .",
    "the basic physics connecting the luminosity and color of a cepheid to its period is well understood . using the stephan - boltzmann law",
    "@xmath48 the bolometric luminosities , @xmath36 , of all stars , including cepheids , can be derived .",
    "expressed in magnitudes , the stefan - boltzmann law becomes @xmath49 hydrostatic equilibrium can be achieved for long periods of time along the core - helium - burning main sequence . as a result stars are constrained to reside there most of the time , thereby bounding the permitted values of the independent radius and temperature variables for stars in the m@xmath50 - @xmath51 plane .",
    "if   @xmath52 is mapped into an observable intrinsic color ( i.e. , @xmath53 or @xmath54 ) and radius is mapped into an observable period ( through a period - mean - density relation ) , the period - luminosity - color ( plc ) relation for cepheids can be determined ( e.g. , sandage 1958 ; sandage & gratton 1963 ; and sandage & tammann 1968 ) . in its",
    "linearized form for pulsating variables , the stefan - boltzmann law takes on the following form of the plc : @xmath55 .",
    "cepheid pulsation occurs because of the changing atmospheric opacity with temperature in the doubly - ionized helium zone .",
    "this zone acts like a heat engine and valve mechanism . during the portion of the cycle when the ionization layer is opaque to radiation that layer traps energy resulting in an increase in its internal pressure .",
    "this added pressure acts to elevate the layers of gas above it resulting in the observed radial expansion .",
    "as the star expands it does work against gravity and the gas cools . as it does",
    "so its temperature falls back to a point where the doubly - ionized helium layer recombines and becomes transparent again , thereby allowing more radiation to pass . without that added source of heating the local pressure drops ,",
    "the expansion stops , the star recollapses , and the cycle repeats .",
    "the alternate trapping and releasing of energy in the helium ionization layer ultimately gives rise to the periodic change in radius , temperature and luminosity seen at the surface .",
    "not all stars are unstable to this mechanism .",
    "the cool ( red ) edge of the cepheid instability strip is thought to be controlled by the onset of convection , which then prevents the helium ionization zone from driving the pulsation . for hotter temperatures ,",
    "the helium ionization zone is located too far out in the atmosphere for significant pulsations to occur .",
    "further details can be found in the classic stellar pulsation text book by cox ( 1980 ) .",
    "cepheids have been intensively modeled numerically , with increasingly sophisticated hydrodynamical codes ( for a recent review see buchler 2009 ) .",
    "while continuing progress is being made , the challenges remain formidable in following a dynamical atmosphere , and in modeling convection with a time - dependent mixing length approximation . in general , observational and theoretical period - luminosity - color relations",
    "are in reasonable agreement ( e.g. , caputo 2008 ) . however , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : metallicity ] , subtle effects ( for example the effect of metallicity on cepheid luminosities and colors ) remain difficult to predict from first principles .      if one adopts a mean extinction law and applies it universally to all cepheids , regardless of their parent galaxy s metallicity , then one can use the observed colors and magnitudes of the cepheids to correct for the total line - of - sight extinction .",
    "if , for example , observations are made at @xmath56 and @xmath57 wavelengths ( as is commonly done with hst ) , and the ratio of total - to - selective absorption @xmath58 is adopted _ a priori _ ( _ e.g. , _ cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) , then one can form from the observed colors and magnitudes an extinction - free , wesenheit magnitude , w , ( madore 1982 ) , defined by @xmath59 as well as an intrinsic wesenheit magnitude , w@xmath5 @xmath60 by construction @xmath61 where v = @xmath62 + @xmath63 and ( v - i ) = @xmath54 + e(v - i ) , and @xmath64 , thereby reducing the last two terms to zero , leaving @xmath65 which is equivalent to the definition of @xmath66 .",
    "the numerical value of w as constructed from observed data points is numerically identical to the intrinsic ( unreddened ) value of the wesenheit function , @xmath66 .",
    "thus , w , for any given star , is dimmed only by distance and ( by its definition ) it is unaffected by extinction , again only to the degree that r is known and is universal .",
    "w can be formed for any combination of optical / near - infrared bandpasses .",
    "the atmospheres of stars like cepheids , having effective temperatures typical of g and k supergiants , are affected by changes in the atmospheric metal abundance .",
    "there are additionally changes in the overall stellar structure ( the mass - radius relation ) due to changes in chemical composition .",
    "thus , it is expected that the colors and magnitudes of cepheids , and their corresponding pl relations , should be a function of metallicity . however , predicting the magnitude ( and even simply the sign of the effect ) at either optical or even longer wavelengths , has proven to be challenging : different theoretical studies have led to a range of conclusions .",
    "we review below the empirical evidence . for a comparison with recent theoretical studies",
    "we refer the interested readers to papers by sandage , bell & tripicco ( 1999 ) , bono et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , caputo ( 2008 ) and romaniello et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "two tests of the metallicity sensitivity of the cepheid pl relation have been proposed .",
    "the first test uses measured radial metallicity gradients within individual galaxies to provide a differential test in which observed changes in the cepheid zero point with radius are ascribed to changes in metallicity .",
    "this test assumes that the cepheids and the hii regions ( which calibrate the measured [ o / h ] abundances ) share the same metallicity at a given radius , and that other factors are not contributing to a zero - point shift , such as radially dependent crowding or changes of the extinction law with radius , etc .",
    "the second test uses the difference between cepheid and trgb distances for galaxies with both measurements and seeks a correlation of these differences as a function of the cepheid ( i.e. , hii region ) metallicity .",
    "the first test , leveraging metallicity gradients in individual galaxies , has been undertaken for m31 ( freedman & madore 1990 ) , m101 ( kennicutt et al . 1998 ) , ngc  4258 ( macri et al .",
    "2006 ) and m33 ( scowcroft et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the second test , comparing trgb and cepheid distances , was first made by lee , freedman & madore ( 1993 ) .",
    "udalski et al . (",
    "2001 ) used a newly observed sample of cepheids in ic  1613 in comparison to a trgb distance to that same galaxy , and concluded that , in comparison with the smc , lmc and ngc  6822 there was no metallicity effect over a factor of two in metallicity at low mean metallicity .",
    "an extensive cross comparison of cepheid and trgb distances including high - metallicity systems is well summarized by sakai et al .",
    "individual datasets and metallicity calibrations are still being debated , but the general concensus is that for the reddening - free w(vi ) calibration of the cepheid distance scale there is a metallicity dependence that , once corrected for , increases the distance moduli of higher metallicity cepheids if their distances are first determined using a lower metallicity ( e.g. , lmc ) pl calibration . however , in a different approach , romaniello et al ( 2008 ) have obtained direct spectroscopic [ fe / h ] abundances for a sample of galactic , lmc and smc cepheids .",
    "they compare the leavitt law for samples of stars with different mean metallicities and find a dependence of the v - band residuals with [ fe / h ] abundance that is in the opposite sense to these previous determinations . clearly",
    "the effect of metallicity on the observed properties of cepheids is still an active and on - going area of research .",
    "a remaining uncertainty at the end of the h@xmath5 key project ( described further in  [ sec : hstkp ] was due to the fact that the majority of key project galaxies have metallicities more comparable to the milky way than to the lmc , which was used for the calibration .",
    "below , in ",
    "[ sec : plcalibration ] we ameliorate this systematic error by adopting a galactic calibration provided by new trigonometric parallaxes of milky way cepheids , not available at the time of the key project . by renormalizing to a high - metallicity ( galactic ) calibration for the cepheids ,",
    "metallicity effects are no longer a major systematic , but rather a random error , whose size will decrease with time as the sample size increases .",
    "based on the cepheid metallicity calibration of sakai et al ( 2004 ) ( with adopted lmc and solar values for 12 + log ( o / h ) of 8.50 and 8.70 , respectively ; and a metallicity slope of 0.25  mag / dex ) , we estimate the metallicity correction in transforming from an lmc to a galactic - based cepheid zero point to be 0.25 x 0.2 = 0.05 mag , with a residual scatter of about @xmath0 0.07  mag .      an accurate trigonometric parallax calibration for galactic cepheids has been long sought , but very difficult to achieve in practice .",
    "all known classical ( galactic ) cepheids are more than 250  pc away : therefore for direct distance estimates good to 10% , parallax accuracies of @xmath00.2   milliarcsec are required , necessitating space observations .",
    "the hipparchos satellite reported parallaxes for 200 of the nearest cepheids , but ( with the exception of polaris ) even the best of these were of very low signal - to - noise ( feast & catchpole 1997 ) .",
    "recent progress has come with the use of the fine guidance sensor on hst ( benedict et al .",
    "2007 ) , whereby parallaxes , in many cases accurate to better than @xmath010% for individual stars were obtained for 10 cepheids , spanning the period range 3.7 to 35.6 days .",
    "we list the distance moduli , errors , and distances for these cepheids in table 1 .",
    "these nearby cepheids span a range of distances from about 300 to 560 pc .",
    "the calibration of the leavitt relation based on these ten stars leads to an error on their mean of @xmath03% ( or @xmath00.06  mag ) , which we adopt here as the systematic error on the distance to the lmc discussed below , and the cepheid zero point , in general .",
    "in what follows , we adopt the zero - point based on the galactic calibration , but retain the slope based on the lmc , since the sample size is still much larger and statistically better defined .",
    "improvement of this calibration ( both slope and zero point ) awaits a larger sample of ( long - period ) cepheids from gaia .",
    "we have adopted a zero - point calibration based both on these hst data , as well as a calibration based on the maser galaxy , ngc 4258 (  [ sec : masers ] ) and present a revised value of h@xmath5 in  [ sec : hstkp ] .",
    "a significant systematic at this time is the calibration zero point .",
    "its value depends on only ten stars , each of which have uncertainties in their distances that are individually at the 10% level .",
    "given the small sample size of the galactic calibrators , the error on their mean can be no better than 3% ( or @xmath00.06  mag ) , which we adopt here as the newly revised systematic error on the distance to the lmc , and on the cepheid zero point in general . in what follows ,",
    "we adopt the zero point based on the galactic calibration , but retain the slope based on the lmc , because the sample size is still much larger and therefor statistically better defined .",
    "there has recently been discussion in the literature about possible variations in the slope of the leavitt law occurring around 10 days ( see ngeow , kanbur & nanthakumar ( 2008 ) and references therein ) ; however , riess et al .",
    "( 2009a ) and madore & freedman ( 2009 ) both find that when using w , the differences are not statistically significant .",
    "improvement of this calibration ( both in the slope and zero point ) awaits a larger sample of ( long - period ) cepheids from the global astrometric interforometer for astrophysics satellite ( gaia ) .      because of the abundance of known cepheids in the large magellanic cloud this galaxy has historically played a central role in the calibration of the cepheid extragalactic distance scale .",
    "several thousand cepheids have been identified and cataloged in the lmc ( leavitt 1908 ; alcock et al .",
    "2000 ; soszynski et al . 2008 ) , all at essentially the same distance .",
    "specifically , the slope of the leavitt law is both statistically and systematically better determined in the lmc than it is for cepheids in our own galaxy .",
    "this is especially true for the long - period end of the calibration where the extragalactic samples in general are far better populated than the more restricted milky way subset available in close proximity to the sun . in figure 2",
    "we show the range of values of lmc distance moduli based on non - cepheid moduli , published up to 2008 .",
    "the median value of the non - cepheid distance moduli is 18.44@xmath00.16 mag .",
    "based on the new results for direct geometric parallaxes to galactic cepheids ( benedict et al .",
    "2007 ) discussed in  [ sec : plcalibration ] , we calibrate the sample of lmc cepheids used as fiducial for the hst key project .",
    "the new galactic parallaxes now allow a zero point to be obtained for the leavitt law . in figure 3 , we show bvijhk leavitt laws for the galaxy and lmc calibrated with the new parallaxes .",
    "as can be seen , the slope of the leavitt law increases with increasing wavelength , with a corresponding decrease in dispersion . in the past , because of the uncertainty in the galactic cepheid calibration , a distance modulus to the lmc and the mean cepheid extinction were obtained using a combination of several independent methods .",
    "multi - wavelength leavitt laws were then used to obtain differential extragalactic distances and reddenings for galaxies beyond the lmc .",
    "we can show here for the first time the multiwavelength solution for the distance to the lmc itself based on the apparent bvijhk cepheid distance moduli , fit to a cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) extinction curve , and adopting a galactic calibration for the zero point , and the slope from the lmc data .",
    "the lmc apparent moduli , scaled to the galactic calibration are shown as a function of inverse wavelength in figure 4 .",
    "the data are well fit by a galactic extinction law having a scale factor corresponding to e(b - v ) = 0.10  mag , and an intercept at 1/@xmath67 = 0.00 , corresponding to a true modulus of @xmath68 = 18.40  @xmath00.01 mag .",
    "the composite ( galactic + lmc ) vi wesenheit function is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the correspondence between the two independent cepheid samples is good , and the dispersion in w remains very small .",
    "the wesenheit function uses fewer wavelengths , but it employs the two bandpasses directly associated with the hst key project and most extragalactic cepheid distances , and so we adopt it here .",
    "the w(v , vi ) wesenheit function gives a minimized fit between the galactic and the lmc cepheids corresponding to a true distance modulus of @xmath68 = 18.44  @xmath00.03  mag .",
    "correcting for metallicity ( see  [ sec : metallicity ] ) would decrease this to 18.39  mag . because of the large numbers of cepheids involved over numerous wavelengths , the statistical errors on this value are small ; and once again systematic errors dominate the error budget . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : plcalibration ] , we adopt a newly revised systematic error on the distance to the lmc , of 3% ( or @xmath00.06  mag ) .    as noted above",
    ", the main drawback to using the lmc as the fundamental calibrator of the leavitt law is the fact that the lmc cepheids are of lower metallicity than many of the more distant spiral galaxies useful for measuring the hubble constant .",
    "this systematic is largely eliminated by adopting the higher - metallicity galactic calibration as discussed in  [ sec : metallicity ] , or the ngc 4258 calibration discussed in  [ sec : masers ] .      as discussed briefly in  [ sec : metallicity ] a completely independent method for determining distances to nearby galaxies that has comparable precision to cepheids is the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) .",
    "the trgb method uses the theoretically well - understood and observationally well - defined discontinuity in the luminosity function of stars evolving up the red giant branch in old , metal - poor stellar populations .",
    "this feature has been calibrated using galactic globular clusters , and because of its simplicity and straightforward application it has been widely used to determine distances to nearby galaxies .",
    "a recent and excellent review of the topic is given by rizzi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and bellazzini ( 2008 ) .    using the brightest stars in globular clusters to estimate distances",
    "has a long history ( ultimately dating back to shapley 1930 and later discussed again by baade 1944 ) .",
    "the method gained widespread application in a modern context in two papers , one by da costa & armandroff ( 1990 ) ( for galactic globular clusters ) , and the other by lee , freedman & madore ( 1993 ) ( where the use of a quantitative digital filter to measure the tip location was first introduced in a extragalactic context ) .",
    "approximately 250 galaxies have had their distances measured by the trgb method , compared to a total of 57 galaxies with cepheid distances .",
    "( a comprehensive compilation of direct distance determinations is available at the following web site : http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/ned1d/ned1d.html ) . in practice ,",
    "the trgb method is observationally a much more efficient technique , since , unlike for cepheid variables , there is no need to follow them through a variable light cycle : a single - epoch observation , made at two wavelengths ( to provide color information ) is sufficient .",
    "a recent example of applying the trgb technique to the maser galaxy , ngc  4258 , is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the evolution of a post - main - sequence low - mass star up the red giant branch is one of the best - understood phases of stellar evolution ( e.g. , iben & renzini 1983 ) . for the stars of interest in the context of the trgb , a helium core forms at the center , supported by electron degeneracy pressure .",
    "surrounding the core , and providing the entire luminosity of the star is a hydrogen - burning shell .",
    "the `` helium ash '' from the shell increases the mass of the core systematically with time . in analogy with the white dwarf equation of state and the consequent scaling relations that interrelate core mass , m@xmath69 , and core radius , r@xmath69 , for degenerate electron support , the core (= shell ) temperature , t@xmath69 , and",
    "the resulting shell luminosity are simple functions of m@xmath69 and r@xmath69 alone : @xmath70 and @xmath71 as a result , the core mass increases , the radius simultaneously shrinks and the luminosity increases due to both effects .",
    "the star ascends the red giant branch with increasing luminosity and higher core temperatures .",
    "when @xmath72 exceeds a physically well - defined temperature , helium ignites throughout the core . the helium core ignition does not make the star brighter , but rather it eliminates the shell source by explosively heating and thereby lifting the electron degeneracy within the core .",
    "this dramatic change in the equation of state is such that the core flash ( which generates the equivalent instantaneous luminosity of an entire galaxy ) is internally quenched in a matter of seconds , inflating the core and settling down to a lower - luminosity , helium core - burning main sequence .",
    "the transition from the red giant to the horizontal branch occurs rapidly ( within a few million years ) so that observationally the trgb can be treated as a physical discontinuity .",
    "a stellar evolutionary `` phase change '' marks the trgb .",
    "the underlying power of the trgb is that it is a physically - based and theoretically well - understood method for determining distance .",
    "nuclear physics fundamentally controls the stellar luminosity at which the rgb is truncated , essentially independent of the chemical composition and/or residual mass of the envelope sitting above the core .",
    "the radiation from stars at the trgb is redistributed with wavelength as a function of the metallicity and mass of the envelope .",
    "empirically it is found that the bolometric corrections are smallest in the @xmath57-band , and most recent measurements have been made at this wavelength .",
    "the small residual metallicity effect on the trgb luminosity is well documented , and can be empirically calibrated out ( see madore , mager & freedman 2009 ) .      in the context of measuring the hubble constant , rgb stars are not as bright as cepheids , and therefore can not be seen as far , but they can still be seen to significant distances ( @xmath1720  mpc and including virgo , e.g. , durrell et al .",
    "2007 ; caldwell 2006 ) and , as we have seen , they can serve an extremely important function as an independent test of the cepheid distance scale and check on systematic effects .",
    "mould & sakai ( 2008 ) have used the trgb as an alternate calibration to the cepheid distance scale for the determination of h@xmath5 .",
    "they use 14 galaxies for which trgb distances can be measured to calibrate the tully - fisher relation , and determine a value of @xmath73 = 73 @xmath0 5 ( statistical only ) km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , a value about 10% higher than found earlier by sakai et al .",

    "they conclude that the trgb and cepheid distances scales are all consistent using sbf , fp , sne ia and the tf relation .",
    "@xmath74 mega - masers have recently been demonstrated to be a powerful new geometric tool for accurately measuring extragalactic distances .",
    "an extensive review of both the physical nature and the application of mega - masers to the extragalactic distance scale can be found in lo ( 2005 ) .",
    "the technique utilizes the mapping of 22.2 ghz water maser sources in the accretion disks of massive black holes located in spiral galaxies with active galactic nuclei , through modeling of a rotating disk ideally in pure keplerian motion . in the simplest version of the technique ,",
    "a rotation curve is measured along the major axis of the disk ; proper motions are measured on the near side of the disk minor axis , and a comparison of the angular velocities in the latter measurement with the absolute velocities in km s@xmath1 in the former measurements yields the distance .",
    "the method requires a sample of accretion disks that are relatively edge on ( so that a rotation curve can be obtained from radial - velocity measurements ) and a heating source such as x - rays or shocks to produce maser emission .",
    "the basic assumption is that the maser emission arises from trace amounts of water vapor ( @xmath4610@xmath75 in number density ) in very small density enhancements in the accretion disk and that they act as perfect dynamical test particles .",
    "the maser sources appear as discrete peaks in the spectrum or as unresolved spots in the images constructed from very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "measurements of the acceleration ( a = v@xmath13/ r ) are obtained directly by monitoring the change of maser radial velocities over time from single - dish observations .",
    "proper motions are obtained from observed changes in angular position in interferometer images .",
    "the approximately keplerian rotation curve for the disk is modeled , allowing for warps and radial structure .",
    "the best studied galaxy , ngc 4258 , at a distance of about 7 mpc , is too close to provide an independent measurement of the hubble constant ( i.e. , free from local velocity - field perturbations ) but it serves as an invaluable independent check of the cepheid zero - point calibration .",
    "vlbi observations of @xmath74 maser sources surrounding the active galactic nucleus of ngc 4258 reveal them to be in a very thin , differentially rotating , slightly warped disk .",
    "the keplerian velocity curve has deviations of less than one percent .",
    "the disk has a rotational velocity in excess of 1,000 km / s at distances on the order of 0.1 pc from the inferred super - massive ( 10@xmath76m@xmath77 ) nuclear black hole .",
    "detailed analyses of the structure of the accretion disk as traced by the masers have been published ( e.g. , herrnstein et al .",

    "it has been possible to measure both proper motions and accelerations of these sources and thereby allow for the derivation of two independent distance estimates to this galaxy .",
    "the excellent agreement of these two estimates supports the _ a priori _ adoption of the keplerian disk model and gives distances of 7.2 @xmath0 0.2 and 7.1 @xmath0 0.2  mpc , respectively .    because of the simplicity of the structure of the maser system in ngc 4258 and its relative strength , ngc 4258 will remain a primary test bed for studying systematic effects that may influence distance estimates .",
    "several problems may limit the ultimate accuracy of this technique , however .",
    "for example , because the masers are only distributed over a small angular part of the accretion disk , it is difficult to assess the importance of non - circular orbits . of possible concern , eccentric disks of stars have been observed in a number galactic nuclei where the potential is dominated by the black hole , as is the case for ngc 4258 .",
    "in addition , even if the disk is circular , it is not a given that the masers along the minor axis are at the same radii as the masers along the major axis .",
    "the self gravity of the disk also may need to be investigated and modeled since the maser distribution suggests the existence of spiral arms ( humphreys et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "finally , radiative transfer effects may cause non - physical motions in the maser images .",
    "although the current agreement of distances using several techniques is comforting , having only one sole calibrating galaxy for this technique remains a concern , and further galaxies will be required to ascertain the limiting uncertainty in this method .",
    "the first cepheid distance to ngc  4258 was published by maoz et al , ( 1999 ) who found a distance of 8.1@xmath00.4 mpc , based on an lmc - calibrated distance modulus of 18.50  mag .",

    "the future for this technique ( beyond 2020 ) looks promising , given a high- frequency capability for the square kilometer array .      for distances to elliptical galaxies and early - type spirals with large bulge populations the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method , first introduced by tonry and schneider ( 1988 ) , overlaps with and substantially exceeds the current reach of the trgb method .",

    "the primary goals of the hst key project were to discover and measure the distances to nearby galaxies containing cepheid variables , calibrate a range of methods for measuring distances beyond the reach of cepheids to test for and minimize sources of systematic uncertainty , and ultimately to measure @xmath86 to an accuracy of @xmath010% .",
    "hst provided the opportunity to measure cepheid distances a factor of 10 more distant than could be routinely obtained on the ground .",
    "it also presented a practical advantage in that , for the first time , observations could be scheduled in a way that optimized the discovery of cepheids with a range of periods independent of phase of the moon or weather ( madore & freedman 2005 ) .",
    "cepheid distances to 18 galaxies with distances in the range of 3 to 25 mpc were measured using wf / pc and ( primarily ) wfpc2 on hst .",
    "observations at two wavelengths ( @xmath56- and @xmath57-band ) were made , chosen to allow corrections for dust .",
    "the spacing of observations was optimized to allow for the discovery of cepheids with periods in the range of 10 to 50 days .",
    "in addition , 13 additional galaxies with published cepheid photometry were analyzed for a total of 31 galaxies .",
    "these cepheid distances were then used to calibrate the tully - fisher relation for spiral galaxies , the peak brightness of type ia sne , the d@xmath87 relation for elliptical galaxies , the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method , and type ii supernovae ( freedman 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "these methods allowed a calibration of distances spanning the range of about 70 mpc ( for sbf ) out to about 400 mpc for type ia sne .",

    "although , the new parallax calibration results in a shorter distance to the lmc ( which is no longer used here as a calibrator ) , the difference in h@xmath5 is nearly offset by the fact that no metallicity correction is needed to offset the difference in metallicity between the lmc and calibrating galaxies .      a primary goal of the hst key project was the explicit propagation of statistical errors , combined with the detailed enumeration of and accounting for known and potential systematic errors .",

    "identified systematic uncertainties in the hst key project determination of the extragalactic distance scale limited its stated accuracy to @xmath010% .",
    "the dominant systematics were : ( a ) the zero point of the cepheid pl relation , which was tied directly to the ( independently adopted ) distance to the lmc ; ( b ) the differential metallicity corrections to the pl zero point in going from the relatively low - metallicity ( lmc ) calibration to target galaxies of different ( and often larger ) metallicities ; ( c ) reddening corrections that required adopting a wavelength dependence of the extinction curve that is assumed to be universal ; and ( d ) zero - point drift , offsets , and transformation uncertainties between various cameras on hst and on the ground .",

    "the time delay observed between multiple images is proportional to h@xmath88 , and is less dependent on other cosmological parameters such as @xmath19 and @xmath89 .",
    "an extensive review of the physics of lensing can be found in blandford & narayan ( 1986 ) ; the observational issues have been summarized nicely by myers ( 1999 ) and schechter ( 2005 ) .",
    "initially , the practical implementation of this method suffered from a number of difficulties .",
    "time delays have proven difficult to measure accurately , the amplitude of quasar variability is generally small , and relatively few lens systems that can be modeled simply and cleanly have been found .",
    "dust obscuration is an issue at optical wavelengths .",
    "a great challenge of this method is that astronomical lenses are galaxies whose underlying mass distributions are not known , and a strong physical degeneracy exists between the mass distribution of the lens and the value of h@xmath5 .",
    "as emphasized by gorenstein , shapiro & falco ( 1988 ) , the deflections and distortions do not uniquely determine the mass distribution : a lens may be located in a group(s ) or cluster(s ) , which will affect the predicted time delays , an effect termed the mass sheet degeneracy .",
    "measurements of velocity dispersion as a function of position can be used to constrain the mass distribution of the lens , but generally only central velocity dispersion measurements are feasible .",
    "an advantage of the method is that it offers a probe directly at cosmological distances ; the concomittent disadvantage is that the cosmological model must be assumed in order to determine h@xmath5 .",
    "earlier estimates of h@xmath5 using this technique yielded values about 10% lower ( analyzing the same data ) , assuming what was then the standard cosmological model with @xmath19 = 1.0 , in comparison to the current standard model with @xmath19 = 0.3 and @xmath89 = 0.7 .",

    "this scattering leads to a redistribution of the cmb photons so that a fraction of the photons move from the rayleigh - jeans to the wien side of the blackbody spectrum , referred to as the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect .",
    "the measured effect amounts to about 1 mk .",
    "the hubble constant is obtained using the fact that the measured x - ray flux from a cluster is distance - dependent , whereas the sz decrement is essentially independent of distance .",
    "observations of this effect have improved enormously in recent years , with high signal - to - noise , high angular resolution , sz images obtained with ground - based interferometric arrays and high - resolution x - ray spectra .",
