    "the model of maximal flow in a randomly porous medium with independent and identically distributed capacities has been introduced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this model is to understand the behaviour of the maximum amount of flow that can cross the medium from one part to another .",
    "all the precise definitions will be given in section [ chapitre6sec : notations ] , but let us draw the general picture in dimension @xmath2 .",
    "the random medium is represented by the lattice @xmath3 .",
    "we see each edge as a microscopic pipe which the fluid can flow through . to each edge @xmath4",
    ", we attach a non - negative capacity @xmath5 which represents the amount of fluid ( or the amount of fluid per unit of time ) that can effectively go through the edge @xmath4 .",
    "capacities are then supposed to be random , identically and independently distributed with common distribution function @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be some hyperrectangle in @xmath8 and @xmath9 an integer .",
    "the portion of medium that we will look at is a box @xmath10 of basis @xmath11 and of height @xmath12 , which @xmath11 splits into two boxes of equal volume .",
    "the boundary of @xmath10 is thus split into two parts , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "there are two protagonists in this play , two types of flows through @xmath10 : the maximal flow @xmath15 for which the fluid can enter the box through @xmath13 and leave it through @xmath14 , and the maximal flow @xmath16 for which the fluid enters @xmath10 only through its bottom side and leaves it through its top side .",
    "the first quality of @xmath15 is that it is ( almost ) a subadditive quantity , whereas @xmath16 is not .",
    "the main question now is : `` how do @xmath16 and @xmath15 behave when @xmath9 is large ? '' .    in this paper",
    ", we shall understand this question as `` is there a law of large numbers for @xmath16 and @xmath15 ? '' , and let us say that such results do indeed already exist .",
    "however , it is important to stress that the orientation of @xmath7 plays an important role in these results .",
    "indeed , the first ones were obtained for `` straight '' boxes , i.e. , when @xmath7 is of the form @xmath17 \\times \\{0\\}$ ] . especially concerning the study of @xmath16 , this simplifies considerably the task .",
    "let us draw a precise state of the art .",
    "the law of large numbers for @xmath15 were proved under mild hypotheses : in @xcite for straight boxes and in @xcite for general boxes .",
    "these results follow essentially from the subadditivity property already alluded to .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 has finite expectation , @xmath18 denotes a unit vector orthogonal to a hyperrectangle @xmath7 containing the origin of the graph , and @xmath19 goes to infinity .",
    "then there is a function @xmath20 defined on @xmath21 such that : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath24-dimensional hausdorff measure of @xmath11 .",
    "if the height function @xmath19 is negligible compared to @xmath9 , @xmath16 satisfies the same law of large numbers as @xmath9 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "otherwise , the law of large numbers for @xmath16 was proved only for straight boxes , with suboptimal assumptions on the height @xmath25 , the moments of @xmath6 and on @xmath26 , in @xcite . in dimension 2 , this was first studied in @xcite .",
    "the assumption on @xmath26 was optimized in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the assumptions on the moments of @xmath6 and the height @xmath25 have been improved in @xcite .",
    "a specificity of the lattice @xmath3 , namely its invariance under reflexions with respect to integer coordinate hyperplanes , implies that the law of large numbers is the same for @xmath16 and @xmath15 in straight cylinders ( provided @xmath27 does not grow too fast ) .    summarizing , @xmath15 is fairly well studied concerning laws of large numbers , but for @xmath16 , nothing is known when the boxes are not straight , except when the height is small compared to @xmath9 ( note however a related result by @xcite , cf . also remark [ rem : garet2 ] ) .",
    "this paper aims at filling this gap , although we can do so only in dimension 2 .",
    "for instance , suppose that @xmath28 goes to @xmath29 when @xmath9 goes to infinity , with @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 denoting the length of the line segment @xmath7 .",
    "our main results imply , under some conditions on @xmath6 and @xmath7 , that : @xmath32{}\\inf_{\\widetilde{\\theta } \\in [ \\theta-\\alpha,\\theta+\\alpha ] } \\frac{\\nu_{\\widetilde{\\theta}}}{\\cos    ( \\widetilde{\\theta } - \\theta ) } \\qquad \\textrm{a.s . and in } l^1 \\;,\\ ] ] where we re - encoded the function @xmath20 as follows : @xmath33 when @xmath34 makes an angle @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "notice that there is no reason for the limit in ( [ chapitre6eq : introlgn ] ) to be identical to @xmath37 .",
    "thus , something different happens when the boxes are not straight . notice that this fact can already be observed when @xmath6 is concentrated on one point .",
    "for instance , if @xmath38 deterministically and @xmath28 goes to @xmath29 when @xmath9 goes to infinity , with @xmath39 , then one may easily compute that @xmath40 , whereas the limit of @xmath41 is @xmath42 .",
    "moreover the moment conditions on @xmath6 that we need to prove ( [ chapitre6eq : introlgn ] ) are very weak .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ chapitre6sec : notations ] , we give the precise definitions and state the main result of the paper .",
    "section  [ chapitre6subsec : concentration ] is devoted to a deviation result for @xmath16 . in section  [ sec : cvesp ] , we prove the convergence of the rescaled expectation of @xmath16 . finally , we complete the proof of the law of large numbers for @xmath16 in section  [ seclln ] .",
    "the most important notations are gathered in sections  [ chapitre6subsec : maxflow ] to [ chapitre6subsec : duality ] , the relevant background is described in section  [ chapitre6subsec : mainresults ] while our main results are stated in section  [ sec : main ] .",
    "first , let us define the notion of a flow on a finite unoriented graph @xmath43 with set of vertices @xmath44 and set of edges @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath46 be a collection of non - negative real numbers , which are called _ capacities_. it means that @xmath5 is the maximal amount of fluid that can go through the edge @xmath4 per unit of time . to each edge @xmath4 , one may associate two oriented edges , and we shall denote by @xmath47 the set of all these oriented edges .",
