    "the egret experiment aboard cgro has detected more than 60 blazar - type agn @xcite thereby greatly widening the field of extragalactic astronomy .",
    "most of them are observed to be time variable and several sources showed remarkable flares . during the last two years",
    "the two most intense flares along the whole egret mission have been observed from the sources 3c  279 @xcite and pks  1622 - 297 @xcite , which occured on top of an already high flux level .",
    "the comptel experiment @xcite , measuring 0.75 - 30  mev , has detected 8 of these ~ 60 egret blazars @xcite . among them",
    "are 3c  279 and pks  1622 - 297 . in this paper",
    "we report first results on these sources for the time periods for which these flares have been observed by egret at energies above 100  mev .",
    "the flare events have been observed during a three week observation of the virgo sky region from january 16 to february 6 , 1996 for 3c  279 in cgro cycle  5 during the viewing periods ( vps ) 511.0 and 511.5 , and for pks  1622 - 297 during a four week observation towards the galactic center region from june 6 to july 10 , 1995 in cgro cycle  4 covering the vps 421 - 423.5 .",
    "we have applied the standard comptel maximum - likelihood analysis method ( e.g. @xcite ) to derive detection significances , fluxes , and flux errors of sources in the four standard comptel energy bands ( 0.75 - 1  mev , 1 - 3  mev , 3 - 10  mev , 10 - 30  mev ) , and a background modelling technique which eliminates in a first approximation source signatures but preserves the general background structure @xcite . for the 10 - 30  mev range the improved comptel data cuts @xcite , increasing its sensitivity , have been applied . to derive source fluxes , several sources located in the surrounding sky region ( e.g. 3c  279 and 3c  273 in virgo ) have been simultaneously fitted in an iterative procedure , leading to a simultaneous determination of the fluxes of several potential sources and a background model which takes into account the presence of sources . for the analysis of pks  1622 - 297",
    "a diffuse emission model has been included in the fitting procedure as well .",
    "the blazar 3c  279 is detected by comptel with a significance of ~ 4during this observational period of three weeks on virgo in cgro cycle  5 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the observed flux level in the 10 - 30  mev band is the highest ever detected . this is the first redetection of 3c  279 by comptel for energies above ( @xmath23  mev ) since 1991 , when the blazar showed another flare observed simultaneously by egret and comptel ( @xmath3@xcite ) . subdividing the three week period into the individual vps 511.0 ( two weeks ) and 511.5 ( one week ) reveals evidence for a flux jump by roughly a factor of 4 ( fig .",
    "2 ) within 10  days .",
    "the flux value of 3c  279 measured in vp 511.5 is the largest ever observed by comptel .",
    "the significance that the two fluxes are different is 2.6@xmath1 , and represents the shortest time varibility yet observed by comptel from any blazar .",
    "this rise in flux is consistent with the egret observations at energies above 100  mev . during vp  511.0 3c  279",
    "was redetected by egret at a high flux level and rose up to the largest value ever in vp  511.5 @xcite .",
    "[ t ]    the spectral analysis shows positive evidence for the source only at energies above 3  mev .",
    "together with the upper limits derived at the lower energy bands , this indicates a ` hard ' ( photon spectral index @xmath42 ) energy spectrum at mev energies ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "the blazar pks  1622 - 297 is detected with a significance of ~ 5during the four week pointing towards the galactic center in cgro cycle  4 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this is the first detection of this blazar by comptel as was the case for egret @xcite . the comptel light curve , even though the flux variations are not statistically significant , follows the general trend reported by egret at energies above 100  mev .",
    "there is evidence for the source during all four individual vps showing mev flaring of pks  1622 - 297 for at least one month ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the largest flux value is observed during vp  423.0 consistent with the time period of the major flare observed by egret .",
    "a flux drop by a factor of ~ 2.5 between the two last vps , again consistent in trend with egret , is a hint for mev variability as well .",
    "the spectral analysis shows that the source is mainly detected in the highest comptel energy band ( 10 - 30  mev ) , which , together with the upper limits derived at lower energies , indicates a hard ( photon spectral index @xmath42 ) spectrum on average ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "however , we like to point out that the source is located just above the plane near the galactic center region , which is a difficult region for quantitative analysis , especially for energies below 3  mev , due to the diffuse mev emission of the galaxy .",
    "although a diffuse emission model was included in the analysis procedure , the presented spectral results should be considered as preliminary .",
    "we have reported first results of comptel observations of two blazars , 3c  279 and pks  1622 - 297 , for time periods for which egret ( @xmath2100  mev ) observed the two strongest flares ever occuring on top of an already high flux level .",
    "although there are differences in detail , the general mev behaviour of both sources resembles each other surprisingly accurately .",
    "both sources are detected during these periods of high activity at high energies , which by itself demonstrates simultaneous mev - flaring activity .",
    "note , that pks  1622 - 297 is detected for the first time by comptel .",
    "both sources are only detected at the highest comptel energies .",
    "this , together with the upper limits derived at the lower energies , leads to evidence for hard ( photon spectral index @xmath42 ) mev spectra .",
    "the 10 - 30  mev flux follows for both sources the general flux trend as seen by egret with evidence for time variability in the case of 3c  279 and a hint in the case of pks  1622 - 297 .",
    "these similarities support the conclusion that the underlying physical mechanism for activity is the same for both sources .",
    "detailed comptel analyses , concentrating on subsets of these observations are in progress to derive informations on possible time - shifts between the high - energy egret and the low - energy comptel emission .",
    "especially pks  1622 - 297 is a promising candidate for such investigations because the observation covers a time period of high activity in which a flux spike is observed . for 3c  279",
    "the observations are only available at the rising part of the flare .",
    "it remains unclear whether the top of the mev emission is covered by comptel ."
