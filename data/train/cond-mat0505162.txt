    "there has been a surging interest in bent - core liquid crystals since their discovery in 1996 @xcite . typically , these materials consist of molecules comprising rigid , banana - shaped cores made up of a conjugated system of linked aryl groups , and flexible alkyl or alkoxy tails attached to each end .",
    "the molecules are usually achiral and possess electric dipole moments parallel with the molecular @xmath4 axes .",
    "one of the most intriguing properties of these compounds is that , in some cases , chiral ferroelectric or antiferroelectric smectic phases can be observed @xcite .",
    "the chirality arises because the molecules tilt within the smectic layers ; in chiral ( anti)ferroelectric phases all of the molecules tilt in the same sense with respect to the layer polarization vector .",
    "it is not yet clear what is responsible for this spontaneous symmetry - breaking process , although a variety of explanations has been proposed .",
    "one popular explanation involves the long - range dipole - dipole interaction @xcite , while recent theoretical work has identified a central role for dispersion interactions @xcite .",
    "other possible explanations include entropic ` free - volume ' mechanisms @xcite in which an antiferroelectric ordering of the smectic - layer polarizations affords more room for layer fluctuations , and mechanisms in which the molecules themselves spontaneously select chiral molecular conformations @xcite .",
    "there is a growing simulation literature on bent - core liquid crystals .",
    "one of the most simple bent - core molecular models is a dimer made up of two hard spherocylinders @xcite .",
    "this system exhibits isotropic , nematic , smectic , and crystalline phases , but no tilted phases .",
    "the gay - berne dimer model has been studied extensively , with and without molecular dipoles . in the works by memmer @xcite and johnston _",
    "@xcite , isotropic , nematic , tilted smectic , and helical phases were found , depending on the molecular bend angle @xcite and the magnitude of the dipole moment @xcite .",
    "et al . _ studied composite molecules made up of repulsive soft spheres , and found isotropic and tilted crystalline phases @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have studied composite molecules made up of lennard - jones spheres  so called ` composite lennard - jones molecules ' ( cljms )  which exhibit isotropic , nematic , tilted smectic , and tilted crystalline phases @xcite .    in this work",
    "the effects of molecular dipole moments and molecular flexibility on the phase behavior of model bent - core molecules are studied using computer simulations . the model ( to be detailed in section [ sec : simulations ] )",
    "consists of a rigid ` v'-shaped core of soft spheres with a point dipole moment oriented along the @xmath4 axis .",
    "molecular flexibility is included by the addition of short flexible tails to either end .",
    "there is a substantial literature on the effects of these molecular characteristics on linear molecules .",
    "in hard - spherocylinder fluids , the addition of longitudinal molecular dipoles is seen to destabilize the nematic phase , and can even destabilize smectic phases if the dipoles are displaced toward the ends of the molecules @xcite ; transverse dipoles also destabilize the nematic phase with respect to the smectic a @xcite .",
    "gay - berne ellipsoids with longitudinal point dipoles show a stabilization of the nematic phase with respect to the isotropic phase as the dipoles are moved from the centers of the molecules to the ends @xcite , and can exhibit antiferroelectric smectic phases with striped structures @xcite .",
    "tilted polar smectic phases have been reported in fluids of gay - berne molecules with transverse dipole moments @xcite . as far as molecular flexibility",
    "is concerned , the general consensus is that the introduction of flexible tail groups destabilizes the nematic phases of hard spherocylinders @xcite , fused hard - sphere chains @xcite , gay - berne @xcite , and soft - sphere chains @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the simultaneous presence of flexible tails and molecular dipole moments can lead to a stabilization of the nematic phase @xcite . with regard to bent - core molecules , johnston _ et al . _",
    "have shown that the presence of transverse molecular dipoles on gay - berne dimers stabilizes the smectic phases at the expense of nematic phases , increases the tilt angle in tilted smectic phases , and can induce long - range polar ordering @xcite .",
    "in the current work we will show that for the bent - core soft - sphere models considered , the additions of dipolar interactions and flexible tails both destabilize the nematic phase , and that the dipolar interactions reduce the degree of molecular tilt in smectic phases .",
    "this paper also reports our attempts to measure the flexoelectric coefficients @xcite of model bent - core molecules .",
    "there are relatively few accounts of such measurements in the literature .",
    "experimentally , the determination of these quantities is highly non - trivial @xcite , mainly due to the fact that the flexoelectric coefficients are not measured directly , but rather in linear combinations or as ratios involving elastic constants . in simulations ,",
    "the flexoelectric coefficients of pear - shaped gay - berne ellipsoid / lennard - jones sphere molecules have been measured directly using expressions involving the direct correlation function @xcite .",
    "the coefficients for a similar model were studied in simulations using fluctuation expressions @xcite .",
    "the compound 5cb has been studied using a parameterized dipolar gay - berne model and the percus - yevick closure of the ornstein - zernike equation @xcite .",
    "the flexoelectric coefficients were computed using the direct correlation function route , and the results compared moderately well with experiment @xcite . a very recent simulation study of pch5  using a fully atomistic molecular model  employed fluctuation formulae which yielded results in good agreement with experiment @xcite . in the present work",
    "we critically assess the reliability of the fluctuation route in the context of our model systems , and show that the bend flexoelectric coefficients for non - polar molecules can be comparable to those measured in experiments , reflecting the significant role of molecular packing in dense liquids .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : simulations ] the molecular model to be studied is fully defined , and the required simulation methods are described .",
    "simulation results for rigid linear molecules are presented in section [ sec : cssm00 ] , and those for rigid bent - core molecules in sections [ sec : cssm20 ] and [ sec : cssm40 ] .",
    "the effects of molecular flexibility are considered in section [ sec : cssmt ] , and flexoelectricity is discussed in section [ sec : flexo ] .",

    "the molecular models considered in this work are shown schematically in fig .",

    "[ fig : models](a ) ] consists of a rigid core of seven soft spheres arranged in a ` v ' shape with external bond angle @xmath0 defined such that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are unit vectors pointing along the two ` arms ' of the molecule .",
    "the sphere - sphere interaction potential is taken to be the repulsive part of the lennard - jones ( 12,6 ) , i.e. , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the sphere - sphere separation , @xmath10 is an energy parameter , and @xmath11 is the sphere ` diameter ' . in this work",
    "the intramolecular sphere - sphere bond length is set equal to @xmath12 . to identify the molecular axes that will be aligned in orientationally ordered phases , we define three unit vectors associated with the rigid cores of the molecules , as illustrated in fig .  [ fig : models ] .",
    "these vectors are given by @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the molecular models studied in this work : ( a ) the cssm model ; ( b ) the cssmt model . also shown are the molecular axes , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . ]",
    "many real bent - core molecules possess a transverse electric dipole moment aligned along the @xmath4 molecular symmetry axis .",
    "to represent dipole - dipole interactions we have considered the model represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : models](a ) , where a point dipole moment is placed at the center of the apical sphere along the @xmath4 symmetry axis ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction is , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the pair separation vector , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the dipole vector on particle @xmath23 . for brevity , we shall refer to these molecules as ` composite soft - sphere molecules ' ( cssms ) .",
    "common additional features of real bent - core molecules include alkyl or alkoxy chains ( typically 3 - 12 carbons in length ) attached to both ends of each molecule .",
    "to represent these tails we consider the addition of four extra spheres at each end of the model molecules , as represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : models](b ) .",
    "the resulting tail segments are allowed to pivot under the following constraints : the tail bond length is equal to @xmath24 , which corresponds to the ratio of the carbon - carbon bond length to the diameter of the aromatic ring in real bent - core liquid crystals ; each tail segment is oriented at the tetrahedral angle , @xmath25 , with respect to its neighboring segments , mimicking the bond angles in a simple hydrocarbon tail .",
    "clearly this extension will cause a considerable increase in the number of interactions to be evaluated , so to make the simulations tractable we have made the following simplifications .",
    "firstly , we have reduced the size of the rigid bent - core to five spheres .",
    "( with the addition of the tail segments , this actually makes the effective elongations for all of the models considered more comparable . ) secondly , we neglect interactions between tails on different molecules . within the lorentz - berthelot mixing rules",
    "@xcite , this corresponds to setting the tail - sphere diameter to zero . denoting the core and tail spheres by ` c ' and ` t ' , respectively , the interaction potential is , @xmath26 with @xmath27 c or t , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and for simplicity the energy parameter @xmath10 is the same for all pairs .",
    "this is clearly a very crude representation of molecular flexibility , but it has proven to be an appropriate means of extending the range of applicability of simple liquid - crystal models @xcite . even though this is a simple model , configurational - bias mc techniques are required to simulate the system efficiently ; these are summarized in section [ sec : mc ] . for brevity",
    ", we shall refer to these molecules as ` composite soft - sphere molecules with tails ' ( cssmts ) .",
    "reduced units for these systems are defined as follows : reduced molecular density , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the number of molecules and @xmath33 is the system volume ; reduced temperature , @xmath34 ; reduced pressure , @xmath35 ; reduced dipole moment , @xmath36 .",
    "the phase behavior of the model systems was investigated using constant - pressure ( @xmath37 ) and constant - volume ( @xmath38 ) metropolis mc simulations @xcite . in all of the simulations reported in this work ,",
    "the number of molecules was @xmath39 , with initial high - density crystalline configurations consisting of four layers of 100 molecules .",
    "the general approach was to equilibrate the system at low temperature ( @xmath40 ) and high density ( @xmath41 ) using @xmath38 simulations in a cuboidal simulation cell with dimensions @xmath42 and volume @xmath43 , and then switching over to @xmath37 simulations at a fixed pressure of @xmath44 ; earlier work indicated that all of the expected liquid - crystalline phases could be stabilized in a cljm system at this pressure @xcite .",
    "simulations along the isobar were carried out at progressively higher temperatures in order to locate phase transitions between solid , smectic , nematic and isotropic phases ; transitions were identified by measuring the equation of state ( density as a function of temperature ) and relevant order parameters ( detailed below ) .",
    "cooling runs were carried out using cuboidal and/or cubic simulation cells to confirm the existence and nature of the transitions . as explained in ref .  , spot checks on the stress tensor showed that the cuboidal / cubic cells did not mechanically destabilize liquid - crystalline phases .",
    "for the cssm system , straightforward simulation techniques were employed as detailed in earlier work @xcite ; single - particle translation and rotation moves , and volume moves ( in @xmath45 ) , were generated with respective maximum displacement parameters to achieve @xmath46 acceptance rates .",
    "the long - range dipolar interactions were handled using ewald summations with conducting ( ` tin - foil ' ) boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "for the cssmt system the cbmc technique was implemented and optimized as described in refs .  .",
    "tail conformations were sampled by generating 5 trial orientations per segment per mc move .",
    "translational and rotational displacement parameters were adjusted to give an acceptance ratio of @xmath47 ; in @xmath37 simulations the volume moves were adjusted to give a @xmath48 acceptance ratio .",
    "the computational effort required to simulate this system was considerable . to carry out a mc sweep consisting of one attempted translation and rotation per molecule , and one volume move , took approximately 4 seconds on a @xmath49 intel xeon processor ; to achieve equilibration at each state point required",
    "at least @xmath50 mc sweeps    to monitor orientational order , the order tensors @xmath51 for each of the molecular axes @xmath52 , @xmath17 , and @xmath53 were diagonalized yielding the eigenvalues @xmath54 , and the corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the molecular @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 axes were then assigned in order of increasing @xmath61 , and the laboratory axes , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , were identified with the corresponding directors . in practice",
    "this almost invariably meant that the molecular @xmath60 axis was the ` long ' axis @xmath16 and the @xmath58 and @xmath59 axes were @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and that the laboratory @xmath60 axis was @xmath65 .",
    "the usual nematic and biaxial order parameters  @xmath66 and @xmath67 - are then given by , @xmath68 in a perfect uniaxial nematic phase , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , whereas in a perfect biaxial phase , @xmath69 and @xmath71 .",
    "in practice no biaxial ordering was detected in any of the simulations , and so we will not report the numerical values of @xmath67 ( which are less than @xmath72 ) .",

    "this idea is confirmed by the fact that the effective molecular bend is more pronounced in the smectic phase than in the isotropic phase .    in summary ,",
    "the addition of molecular flexibility results in the disappearance of the nematic phase , and in the case of the linear molecules , the smectic - a phase as well .",

    "meyer predicted the existence of what is now known as the _ flexoelectric effect _ in nematic liquid crystals , in which long - wavelength distortions of the local molecular alignment ( director field , @xmath125 ) give rise to a bulk polarization , @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "the textbook explanation of the effect is that if the director field possesses curvature then an asymmetric molecular shape can dictate a favorable local packing arrangement which , in the presence of molecular dipoles , may give rise to a polarization @xcite . with a splay deformation ( @xmath127 ) wedge - shaped molecules with longitudinal dipole moments pack most efficiently when the dipoles are aligned . with a bend deformation ( @xmath128 )",

    "it is therefore reasonable to suggest that the steric or packing contributions to the flexoelectric effect are significant .",
    "the roles of dipolar and quadrupolar electrostatic interactions must surely be at least as significant , and these should be studied in a systematic fashion .",
    "for now , though , we conclude that short - range interactions between bent - core molecules are as important in giving rise to flexoelectricity as they are in dictating the short - range structure of dense atomic liquids @xcite . in drawing this analogy",
    "perhaps we should not be too surprised by the current observations .",
    "the reduced densities of spheres in the cssm and cljm systems are equal to @xmath180 at which packing effects and short - range correlations are particularly pronounced ( recall that the triple - point density for the lennard - jones system is in the region of @xmath181 ) .",
    "in this work the structure , phase behavior , and flexoelectricity of model bent - core molecules have been studied using mc computer simulations .",
    "the molecular bent core consists of a ` v ' shaped rigid array of soft spheres , with a transverse point dipole moment aligned along the @xmath4 symmetry axis .    in a linear seven - sphere non - polar model , isotropic , nematic , smectic - a , and tilted smectic - b ( herringbone ) phases are observed . with an opening angle of @xmath182 the smectic a is absent ,",
    "while an opening angle of @xmath183 gives rise to a direct tilted smectic b  isotropic transition .",
    "the effects of dipolar interactions were seen to depend on the opening angle . in the linear - molecule systems these interactions appeared to destabilize the nematic and smectic - a phases . in the bent - core systems ,",
    "dipolar interactions reduced the degree of molecular tilt in the tilted smectic phases ; this is a significant observation , particularly since dipolar interactions have often been cited as the cause of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in some bent - core liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "chirality arises in this case from the correlation between molecular tilt within smectic layers and the long - range ordering of smectic - layer polarizations .",
    "although spontaneous ( anti)ferroelectric order will be favored by long - range dipolar interactions , the observation that these same interactions reduce molecular tilt seems to suggest that there may be another explanation for chirality in banana liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "real bent - core liquid crystals often possess flexible tail groups at the ends of the rigid bent core , and so cbmc simulations of a flexible - rigid - flexible model were performed .",
    "each molecule consisted of a five - sphere rigid bent core , and a three - segment flexible tail attached to each end .",
    "we could only find smectic and isotropic phases , but significantly the smectic phases showed no spontaneous tilt .",
    "this is probably due to the tails providing a lubricating barrier between the smectic layers that serves to decorrelate the order within neighboring layers .",
    "hence , the addition of molecular flexibility is likely to mitigate against the type of entropic ` sawtooth ' mechanisms that have been found to stabilize antiferroelectric ordering in hard - particle bent - core models @xcite .",
    "the addition of the flexible tails was also seen to give rise to significant spatial fluctuations in the smectic layers .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the smectic phases of rigid model molecules are often far more ordered than real smectics ( as evidenced by scattering experiments @xcite ) .",
    "the introduction of molecular flexibility therefore brings the model systems in to better correspondence with experiment .",
    "finally , the flexoelectric properties of non - polar seven - sphere bent - core molecules - with and without attractive interactions - have been studied by calculating the splay and bend coefficients in the nematic phase using fluctuation relations derived from linear - response theory @xcite .",
    "an immense investment of computational effort was required to obtain reasonable results via this route , which serves to highlight how careful one must be in evaluating the required formulae .",
    "nonetheless , our results show that a significant flexoelectric response can be measured for opening angles below about @xmath184 . with typical molecular dimensions and dipole moments ,",
    "the measured flexoelectric coefficients are in the region of @xmath185 which is in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "the flexoelectric response of real bent - core liquid crystals is often attributed largely to dipolar and quadrupolar interactions , but our results show that the molecular shape is also significant",
    ". this should nt be too much of a surprise , since most thermotropic nematics are , after all , dense molecular liquids , and it is well known that the structure and dynamics in such systems are dictated by short - range repulsive interactions .",
    "we are in no way suggesting that electrostatic interactions are insignificant , and we have not studied flexoelectricity in dipolar or quadrupolar systems because of the computational effort which will probably be required to obtain reliable results",
