    "recently it has been widely recognized that orbital degree of freedom plays an essential role for the understanding of novel magnetism in transition metal oxides @xcite .",
    "a typical material is manganese oxide , exhibiting remarkable colossal magneto - resistance phenomena @xcite . due to competition and interplay among spin , charge , and orbital degrees of freedom ,",
    "rich phase diagram has been revealed @xcite , but a recent trend is to unveil further new phases both from experimental and theoretical investigations . in fact , even in undoped rmno@xmath2 ( r = rare earth lanthanide ions ) , a novel antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase called the `` e - type '' spin structure has been reported as the ground state for r = ho @xcite .",
    "here we follow the definitions of spin structure in ref .",
    "the origin of the e - af phase has been clarified theoretically @xcite based on a band - insulator scenario in the @xmath3-orbital systems @xcite . it should be noted that the ground state of undoped manganites was just considered to be well understood , since for most r - ions , the a - type af insulating phase appears with the c - type ordering of the @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6- and @xmath7@xmath5@xmath6-orbitals @xcite .",
    "moreover , also for the half - doped manganite @xmath8 , a charge - ordered ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase has been found in experiments @xcite , as predicted theoretically @xcite .",
    "these facts clearly indicate the importance of both experimental and theoretical efforts to unveil new phases in manganites in addition to the explanation of the complex phases already observed .",
    "such efforts have also been made to find new phases in other transition metal oxides , for instance , ruthenates @xcite and nickelates @xcite .    a trend to seek for new magnetic as well as",
    "superconducting phases has been also found in the @xmath9-electron system , which is another type of spin - charge - orbital complex . among many kinds of @xmath9-electron materials , in recent years , @xmath9-electron compounds with hocoga@xmath0-type tetragonal crystal structure [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , frequently referred to as `` 115 '' , have been intensively investigated both in experimental and theoretical research fields of condensed matter physics .",
    "such vigorous activities are certainly motivated by high superconducting transition temperature @xmath10 observed in some 115 compounds .",
    "especially , amazingly high value of @xmath10=18.5k has been reported in pucoga@xmath0 @xcite and the mechanism has been discussed theoretically @xcite . among 115 compounds , interesting magnetic properties have been reported for utga@xmath0 , where t is a transition metal ion @xcite .",
    "in particular , neutron scattering experiments have revealed that uniga@xmath0 exhibits the g - type af phase , while updga@xmath0 and uptga@xmath0 have the a - type af state @xcite . note that g - type indicates a three - dimensional nel state ,",
    "while a - type denotes a layered af structure in which spins align ferromagnetically in the @xmath11 plane and af along the @xmath12 axis @xcite .",
    "it is quite interesting that the magnetic structure is different for u-115 compounds which differ only by the substitution of transition metal ions .    .",
    "schematic views of magnetic structures composed of magnetic moments of np ions for ( b ) npfega@xmath0 , ( c ) npcoga@xmath0 , and ( d ) npniga@xmath0 . for npfega@xmath0 ,",
    "magnetic moments at fe sites are also depicted . ]    quite recently , 115 compounds including neptunium have been skillfully synthesized and several kinds of physical quantities have been successfully measured @xcite . especially , the de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) effect has been observed in npniga@xmath0 @xcite , which is the first observation of dhva signal in transuranium compounds . for npcoga@xmath0 ,",
    "the dhva oscillations have been also detected and a couple of cylindrical fermi surfaces are found @xcite . for npfega@xmath0 , the magnetic moment at fe site has been suggested in neutron scattering experiments @xcite and it has been also detected by @xmath13fe mssbauer spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , the magnetic structure of np-115 compounds also depends sensitively on transition metal ion @xcite : c - af for npfega@xmath0 , a - af for npcoga@xmath0 , and g - af for npniga@xmath0 , as shown in figs .",
    "1(b)-(d ) .",
    "note that for npniga@xmath0 , the g - af structure is composed of canted np moments and the peak in the neutron scattering intensity grows @xmath14 the fm transition occurs @xcite . in any case , it is characteristic of u-115 and np-115 compounds that the magnetic properties are sensitive to the choice of transition metal ions .",
    "the appearance of several kinds of af states reminds us of the magnetic phase diagram of manganites and thus , we envisage a scenario to understand the complex magnetic structure of actinide compounds based on an orbital degenerate model similar to that of manganites .",
    "however , one must pay close attention to the meanings of `` spin '' and `` orbital '' in @xmath9-electron systems . since they are tightly coupled with each other through a strong spin - orbit interaction ,",
    "distinguishing them is not straightforward in comparison with @xmath15-electron systems .",
    "this point can create serious problems when we attempt to understand microscopic aspects of magnetism and superconductivity in @xmath9-electron compounds .",
    "thus , it is necessary to carefully define the terms `` orbital '' and `` spin '' for @xmath9 electrons in a microscopic discussion of magnetism and superconductivity in actinide compounds .    in order to overcome such problems ,",
    "we have proposed to employ a @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme to discuss @xmath9-electron systems @xcite . here",
    "we stress the advantages of the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme .",
    "first , it is quite convenient for the inclusion of many - body effects using standard quantum - field theoretical techniques , since individual @xmath9-electron states are clearly defined .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath16 coupling scheme we can not use such standard techniques , since wick s theorem does not hold .",
    "second we can , in principle , include the effects of valence fluctuations . in some uranium compounds ,",
    "the valence of the uranium ion is neither definitely u@xmath17 nor u@xmath18 , indicating that the @xmath9-electron number takes a value between 2 and 3 . in the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme",
    "this is simply regarded as the average number of @xmath9 electron per uranium ion .    in this paper , we attempt to explain the complex magnetic structure of np-115 based on the effective two - orbital model , which has been constructed from the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme in order to understand the magnetic properties of u-115 compounds @xcite .",
    "we depict the fermi surfaces of the kinetic term of @xmath19 electron based on the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme in comparison with those obtained from the dhva experiments .",
    "the agreement seems to be fairly well , but the present itinerant picture should be critically discussed .",
    "then , we apply the exact diagonalization technique to the model in a small 2@xmath202@xmath202 cube to obtain a clue to understand the complex magnetic structure of nptga@xmath0 .",
    "the phase diagrams are found to include g- , a- , and c - type af states , consistent with experimental observations in np-115 .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we will introduce an effective hamiltonian , called the @xmath21 model , for actinide 115 systems . in sec .  3",
    ", we show the calculated results of the model hamiltonian .",
    "the fermi - surface structure is discussed in comparison with dhva experimental results .",
    "we show numerical results for the magnetic structure obtained by using exact diagonalization technique . finally , in sec .",
    "4 , future developments are discussed and the paper is summarized . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use units such that @xmath22=@xmath23=1 .",
    "in this section , we show an effective model based on the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme for np-115 compounds , which is the same as the model for u-115 @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the model with orbital degree of freedom is applicable to actinide 115 materials in common .      in order to construct a microscopic hamiltonian for @xmath9-electron systems ,",
    "it is necessary to include simultaneously the itinerant nature of @xmath9 electrons as well as strong electron correlation and the effect of crystalline electric field ( cef ) . for the purpose ,",
    "we have proposed to use the so - called @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme @xcite . as shown in fig .  2 , we include the spin - orbit coupling so as to define the state labeled by the total angular momentum . for @xmath9 orbitals with @xmath24=3",
    ", we immediately obtain an octet with @xmath1=7/2(=3 + 1/2 ) and a sextet with @xmath1=5/2(=3@xmath51/2 ) , which are well separated by the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "in general , the spin - orbital coupling is as large as 1ev in actinide elements and thus , in the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme , we consider only the @xmath1=5/2 sextet .    in actual compounds , due to the electrostatic potential from ligand ions surrounding the actinide ion ,",
    "the six - fold degeneracy of @xmath1=5/2 is lifted , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "note that in the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme , it is enough to define the one - electron potential , which is deduced from the cef level scheme of corresponding @xmath25-electron system .",
    "first we consider the one @xmath9-electron state in the aucu@xmath2-type cubic crystal structure , since this is the mother structure of hocoga@xmath0-type tetragonal compound .",
    "the effects of tetragonality will be discussed later . for the case of cubic symmetry",
    ", we identify two eigen energies as @xmath26 for the @xmath27 doublet and @xmath28 for the @xmath21 quartet , where @xmath29 is a cubic cef parameter . for the following discussion",
    ", it is quite convenient to introduce `` pseudospin '' to distinguish the degenerate states of the kramers doublet and `` orbital '' to label the different kramers doublets in @xmath21 quartet . in fig .",
    "3(a ) , we show the shape of the wavefuction of two @xmath21 orbitals , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "-electron state in the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme .",
    "the @xmath1=5/2 sextet is split into several kramers doublets due to cubic or tetragonal crystalline electric field effect.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in order to proceed with the discussion , we need to know which is lower , @xmath27 or @xmath21 , in the one @xmath9-electron picture . for some crystal structures ,",
    "it is possible to determine the level scheme from intuitive discussions on @xmath9-electron wavefunctions and the positions of ligand ions .",
    "however , this is not the case for the aucu@xmath2-type crystal structure . for this case",
    "we invoke certain experimental results on cein@xmath2 , a typical aucu@xmath2-type ce - based compound , where @xmath27 and @xmath21 have been reported as ground and excited states , respectively , with an energy difference of 12mev @xcite .",
    "thus , we take @xmath27 to be lower for the present considerations , as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) .    in the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme for uga@xmath2 and npga@xmath2",
    ", it is necessary to accommodate three or four electrons in the one - electron energy states @xmath27 and @xmath21 .",
    "we immediately notice that there are two possibilities , i.e. , low- and high - spin states , depending on the hund s rule interaction and the splitting between the @xmath27 and @xmath21 levels . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective hund s rule interaction becomes small in the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme and thus , the low - spin state should be realized , as shown in figs .",
    "3(c ) and ( d ) .",
    "we emphasize that the low - spin state is consistent with the @xmath16 coupling scheme . in the electron configuration shown in figs .",
    "3(c ) and ( d ) , the @xmath27 level is fully occupied to form a singlet .",
    "if this @xmath27 level is located well below the @xmath21 , the occupying electrons will not contribute to the magnetic properties .",
    "thus , we ignore the @xmath27 electrons in the following discussion . as for details to validate the suppression of @xmath27 level",
    ", readers should refer ref .",
    "we also mention another theoretical effort based on the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme , in which the dual nature , itinerant and localized , of @xmath19 electron has been emphasized @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath32 , in the @xmath21 model .",
    "level scheme for ( b ) cein@xmath2 , ( c ) uga@xmath2 , and ( d ) npga@xmath2 based on the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme .",
    "here we assume trivalent actinide ions as u@xmath17 ( @xmath33 ) and np@xmath17 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "it should be noted that up and down arrows denote pseudospins to distinguish the states in the kramers doublet .",
    "note also that for npga@xmath2 , a couple of electrons in @xmath21 orbitals form a local triplet , leading to @xmath35.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , since 115 compounds have the tetragonal structure , we need to include the effect of tetragonality . in the tetragonal structure , the quartet @xmath21 is further split into two doublets , @xmath36 and @xmath27 , as shown in fig .  2 . namely , there appear three kramers doublets with one @xmath36 and two @xmath27 .",
    "note that two @xmath27 states are obtained from the mixture of @xmath27 and @xmath30 in the cubic symmetry .",
    "however , for simplicity , we ignore the change of wavefunctions from cubic to tetragonal systems , since we believe that the existence of orbital degree of freedom is a key issue to understand the complex magnetic structure of actinide compound . for the purpose to improve the present theory from the quantitative viewpoint",
    ", it may be important to include also the deformation of local @xmath9-electron wavefunction , but we postpone such a study in the future . in this paper , we consider the splitting energy between @xmath21 orbitals , in order to take into account the tetragonality in the 115 compounds .      after tedious calculations",
    ", we obtain the hamiltonian including @xmath21 orbitals in the form of @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the kinetic term of @xmath19 electrons , @xmath39 is the cef potential term , and @xmath40 indicates the coulomb interaction term among @xmath21 electrons .",
    "concerning the kinetic term , one traditional way is to consider the hybridization process between @xmath9 and conduction electrons . for 115 systems , from the band - structure calculations @xcite , @xmath41 electrons of ga ion play an important role to form conduction band .",
    "however , based upon a picture that @xmath19 electrons are itinerant , we can consider another way to construct the kinetic term for @xmath9 electrons within a tight - binding approximation .",
    "in actual compounds , there should occur several processes through other ligand ions , in addition to the direct process of @xmath9 electrons .",
    "however , when we include correctly the local symmetry of relevant @xmath9 orbitals , it is believed that we can grasp qualitative point of kinetic term of @xmath9 electrons , even within the simple tight - binding approximation .",
    "this point will be discussed elsewhere in future .",
    "here we do not consider the hybridization process .",
    "then , the kinetic term is given in the tight - binding approximation for @xmath9 electrons as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the annihilation operator for an @xmath9 electron with pseudospin @xmath44 in the @xmath45-orbital at site @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the @xmath9-electron hopping matrix element between @xmath45- and @xmath48-orbitals along the @xmath49 direction .",
    "indices @xmath50 and @xmath32 denote the @xmath51 and @xmath52 orbitals , respectively . in the @xmath53 plane and along the @xmath54-axis , @xmath47",
    "is given by @xmath55 for the @xmath56-direction , @xmath57 for the @xmath58 direction , and @xmath59 for the @xmath60 direction .",
    "note that @xmath61=(3/7)@xmath62 , where @xmath62 is a slater - koster overlap integral between @xmath9 orbitals through @xmath44 bond . in the following",
    ", @xmath61 is taken as an energy unity .",
    "remark that we introduce another hopping amplitude along the @xmath54-axis . in antga@xmath0 ( an = u and np ) , anga@xmath63 layer is sandwiched by two anga@xmath2 sheets , indicating that the hopping of @xmath9 electron along the @xmath54-axis should be reduced from that in anga@xmath2 .",
    "however , it is difficult to estimate the reduction quantitatively , since it is necessary to include correctly the hybridization with @xmath15 electrons in transition metal ions and @xmath41 electrons in ga ions .",
    "thus , in this paper , we consider the effective reduction by simply treating @xmath64 as a parameter . for a practical purpose",
    ", we introduce a non - dimensional parameter @xmath65=@xmath66 .",
    "we point out that the hopping amplitudes among @xmath21 orbitals are just the same as those for the @xmath3 orbitals of @xmath67 electrons @xcite .",
    "readers can intuitively understand this point from the shapes of @xmath21 orbitals shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , which are similar to @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "mathematically , this is quite natural , if we recall the fact that @xmath21 is isomorphic to @xmath68 , where @xmath69 indicates @xmath70 representation for the orbital part and @xmath36 denotes the spin part .",
    "note , however , that the agreement between @xmath9- and @xmath15-electron hopping amplitudes is due to the choice of special axis directions .",
    "if we take the ( 1,1,0 ) direction in an fcc lattice , @xmath9-electron hopping amplitude becomes complex , leading to the stabilization of octupole ordering in npo@xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the cef term is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72= @xmath73 , @xmath74=@xmath75 , and @xmath76 is the level splitting , which expresses the effect of tetragonal cef , as discussed above .",
    "we note that in actuality , @xmath76 should be related to the value of @xmath65 , since both quantities depend on the lattice constant along the @xmath54 axis .",
    "however , the relation between @xmath65 and @xmath76 is out of the scope of this paper and thus , here we simply treat them as independent parameters .",
    "the coulomb interaction term is expressed by @xmath77 where the coulomb interactions @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 denote intra - orbital , inter - orbital , exchange , and pair - hopping interactions among @xmath21 electrons , respectively , expressed by using the racah parameters @xcite .",
    "note that the relation @xmath78=@xmath79+@xmath80+@xmath81 holds , ensuring rotational invariance in pseudo - orbital space for the interaction part . for @xmath15-electron systems ,",
    "one also has the relation @xmath80=@xmath81 .",
    "when the electronic wavefunction is real , this relation is easily demonstrated from the definition of the coulomb integral .",
    "however , in the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme the wavefunction is complex , and @xmath80 is not equal to @xmath81 in general . for simplicity , we shall assume here that @xmath80=@xmath81 , noting that essential results are not affected .",
    "since double occupancy of the same orbital is suppressed owing to the large value of @xmath78 , pair - hopping processes are irrelevant in the present case .",
    "now let us show our calculated results based on the two - orbital model .",
    "first we discuss the electronic properties of @xmath38 in the non - interacting limit by focusing on the fermi - surface structure , in order to gain an insight into the interpretation of dhva experiments on np-115 compounds .",
    "next the magnetic properties are discussed .",
    "we attempt to understand the appearance of three kinds of magnetic phases based on the orbital - based scenario similar to that of manganites .     tight - binding model for ( a ) @xmath82=2 , @xmath65=1 , @xmath76=0 , ( b ) @xmath82=2 , @xmath65=0.1 , @xmath76=@xmath83 , ( c ) @xmath82=1.5 , @xmath65=1 , @xmath76=0 , and ( d ) @xmath82=1.5 , @xmath65=0.1 , @xmath76=@xmath83 .",

    "we define @xmath82 as the number of @xmath9 electrons included in the @xmath21 state .",
    "namely , the local @xmath9-electron number per actinide ion is @xmath82 + 2 , by adding @xmath27 electrons .    as shown in fig .",
    "3(d ) , in our picture , there are two @xmath21 electrons in trivalent neptunium ion .",
    "then , it is quite natural to consider first the case of @xmath82=2 .",
    "the results for ( @xmath65 , @xmath76)=(1,0 ) and ( 0.1,@xmath83 ) are shown in figs .",
    "4(a ) and ( b ) , respectively . for the cubic case with @xmath65=1 and @xmath76=0 ,",
    "there exist two kinds of cube - like fermi surfaces .",
    "one is centered at @xmath84 point , while the center of another cube is r point . when we change @xmath65 and @xmath76 to consider the tetragonality , cubes gradually change to cylinders . as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , we can clearly observe two kinds of cylindrical fermi surfaces .",
    "note that the fermi - surface structure does not sensitively depend on the value of @xmath76 , as long as the absolute value is not so large as @xmath85@xmath860.5 .",
    "it is important to have quasi orbital degeneracy , to reproduce a couple of cylindrical fermi surfaces .",
    "it is interesting to recall the dhva experiment on npcoga@xmath0 , which has revealed two kinds of cylindrical fermi surface @xcite . in the relativistic band - structure calculations for the paramagnetic phase",
    ", it has been difficult to understand the appearance of a couple of cylindrical fermi surfaces @xcite .",
    "note that the folding of the magnetic brillouin zone can not explain the discrepancy between the experimental results and the band - calculation ones for npcoga@xmath0 .",
    "a direct way to understand the dhva experimental results is to improve the band - structure calculation method , but as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , even in a simple tight - binding model for itinerant @xmath19 electrons , we obtain two kinds of cylindrical fermi surface due to the effect of @xmath21 orbital degree of freedom .",
    "we do not claim that the dhva results can be understood only by the present simple calculations , but a hint to understand the electronic structure of np-115 is believed to be hidden in the construction of our model with @xmath21 orbital degree of freedom .",
    "we point out that in actual np-115 compounds , the number of @xmath82 is not definitely determined . especially , due to the change of transition metal ion , the number of @xmath82 seems to be changed effectively .",
    "in fact , in the relation between superconducting transition temperature @xmath10 and the ratio of lattice constants @xmath87 , the curve of @xmath10 vs. @xmath87 for solid solution ( u , np , pu)coga@xmath0 is similar to that for another solid solution pu(fe , co , ni)ga@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "namely , in actinide 115 materials , the effect of the change of @xmath9-electron number due to the substitution of actinide ion seems to be similar to that of the substitution of transition metal ion .",
    "thus , when we consider the change of the magnetic structure among nptga@xmath0 ( t = fe , co , and ni ) based on the effective two - orbital model , there is no strong reason to fix firmly @xmath82=2 .    in figs .",
    "4(c ) and ( d ) , we show the fermi - surface sheets for @xmath82=1.5 , in which the number of @xmath9 electrons is slightly decreased .",
    "we can observe that the fermi - surface structure is not changed so much , although the cylinder centered at the @xmath84 point becomes slender .",
    "thus , as long as we are based on the simple tight - binding model , it is concluded that the structure of the fermi - surface sheets is not changed sensitively by the number of @xmath82 around at @xmath82=2 .",
    "this result suggests that it is possible to change the value of @xmath82 to consider the magnteic structure of np-115 compounds .",
    "now we consider the magnetic properties of the @xmath21 model . among several methods to analyze the microscopic model , in this paper we resort to an exact diagonalization technique on a 2@xmath202@xmath202 lattice .",

    "as discussed in the previous subsection , the fermi - surface structure does not change so much from that of the case of @xmath82=2 , when @xmath85 is not so large . in fig .",
    "6(a ) , we show the ground - state phase diagram in the @xmath104 plane at @xmath82=1.5 for the cubic case with @xmath65=1 and @xmath76=0 . at @xmath80=0 , a g - type af structure",
    "is stabilized due to superexchange interaction in the same way as the case of @xmath82=2 .",
    "however , the g - af structure is immediately changed to a c - af structure only by a small value of the hund s rule interaction . with increasing @xmath80 , the magnetic phase changes in the order of g - af , c - af , a - af , and fm phases , except for the c - af phase in the large @xmath80 region .",
    "the spin structure of each phase is shown in fig .",
    "this result is quite natural , since we are now considering the magnetic structure based on the two - orbital model , in which the fm tendency is due to the optimization of kinetic motion of electrons",

    "7(a ) , we show typical results of the spin correlation as a function of @xmath76 for @xmath79=5 , @xmath80=0 , and @xmath65=1 . at @xmath76=0 ,",
    "the dominant component of @xmath105 appears at @xmath99=@xmath101 , indicating the g - type af structure . on the other hand , in the region of positive small @xmath76 ,",
    "the spin correlation of @xmath99=@xmath100 turns to be dominant , indicating the c - type af structure .",
    "this phase is defined as c - af(i ) .",
    "concerning the orbital correlation , we find no remarkable structure in the c - af(i ) phase , as shown in fig .",
    "note that in the g - af phase with positive @xmath76 , the orbital correlation of @xmath99=@xmath106 has a significant value in comparison with other regions , since electrons tend to doubly occupy lower @xmath30 orbitals .",
    "this g - af phase is called g - af(i ) . on the other hand , in the g - af phase with negative @xmath76 ,",
    "there is no indication of the development of the orbital correlation of @xmath99=@xmath106 , since the lower @xmath31 orbitals are singly occupied .",
    "we label this g - af phase as g - af(ii ) to distinguish it from g - af(i ) .",
    "it is interesting to see different types of the g - af phases due to the change of the orbital state .",
    "let us now discuss the reason of the appearance of the c - af(i ) phase in the region of positive small @xmath76 . for @xmath76@xmath1070 , the energy level of @xmath30 is lower than that of @xmath31 by definition .",
    "then , the @xmath30 orbital is first occupied by one electron at each site .",
    "the rest of electrons are accommodated in @xmath31 orbitals to avoid the effect of intra - orbital coulomb interaction when @xmath76 is not large so much .",
    "the electrons in @xmath30 orbitals hop to the @xmath30 orbital at the nearest - neighbor site , since the @xmath31 has higher energy .",
    "since the electrons in @xmath30 orbitals move only in the @xmath53 plane , the af structure is stabilized in each @xmath53 plane independently due to superexchange interaction , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "on the other hand , the electrons in @xmath31 orbitals can move itinerantly within the network composed of @xmath31 orbitals due to the existence of holes in @xmath31 orbitals .",
    "since the hopping amplitude along the @xmath54 axis is dominant in the region near @xmath65=1 , the motion of @xmath31 electrons causes an fm spin arrangement of @xmath30 electrons along the @xmath54 axis to gain kinetic energy .",
    "namely , even though localized @xmath108 spins do not exist in the present case , the so - called double - exchange mechanism is always active in the two - orbital model .",
    "note that the c - af structure disappears for large @xmath76 , since all the electrons tend to occupy @xmath30 orbitals and the double - exchange mechanism is no longer active in that situation .",

    "it is found that the c - af(i ) phase discussed above extends to a wide region of @xmath65@xmath861 in the phase diagram .",

    ", there appears yet another g - af phase , called g - af(iii ) , due to the same reason as that for the occurrence of g - af(i ) phase for positive @xmath76 , but the occupied orbital is changed from @xmath30 to @xmath31 . in any case , for @xmath80=0 , we can observe several kinds of c- and g - af phases , but a - af phase does not occur",

    "there are three phases , but they are two c - af and one g - af states .",
    "as labelled explicitly in the phase diagrams , c - af(i ) , c - af(ii ) , and g - af(i ) are the same as those in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "due to the effect of @xmath80 , g - af(ii ) and g - af(iii ) disappear , since the number of fm bonds should be increased to gain the kinetic energy . as shown in fig .",
    "8(b ) , when we further increase the value of @xmath80 as @xmath80=4 , the g - af phase completely disappears and instead , we observe the a - af phase sandwiched by two c - af phases .",
    "as described above , due to the double - exchange mechanism in the two - orbital model , the a - af phase is considered to appear , when @xmath80 is increased .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed an effective model with active orbital degree of freedom to understand the magnetic structure of neptunium 115 compounds from the microscopic viewpoint . by analyzing the model with the use of the exact diagonalization technique",

    "c- , a- , and g - af magnetic phases have been found in npfega@xmath0 , npcoga@xmath0 , and npniga@xmath0 . here we have a question : what is a key parameter to understand the change of the magnetic structure ? in the case of utga@xmath0 , it has been claimed that the level splitting @xmath76 is important to explain the difference in magnetic structure as well as the magnetic anisotropy for a fixed value of @xmath82=1 @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "@xmath76 is positive for t = fe , small positive for t = co , and negative for t = ni . among utga@xmath0 with t",

    "it has been found that the value of @xmath65 is not so crucial to explain qualitatively the magnetic properties of u-115 based on the two - orbital model for @xmath82=1 .    for @xmath82=2 , as emphasized in the previous section",
    ", we always obtain the g - af phase . however , for @xmath82=1.5",
    ", we have observed three kinds of af magnetic structure in the phase diagrams .",
    "let us summarize the change in the magnetic structure for a fixed value of @xmath65=0.8 .",
    "note that this value is larger than @xmath65=0.1 , which we have considered to reproduce two kinds of cylindrical fermi - surface sheets of np-115 .",
    "however , in the small - sized cluster calculations , it is difficult to compare directly with the values in the thermodynamic limit . thus , we do not discuss further the quantitative point on the values of @xmath65 here . as shown in fig .",
    "7(d ) , for @xmath80=0 and @xmath65=0.8 , we see the change in the magnetic structure as g - af ( @xmath76@xmath860 ) , c - af(0@xmath86@xmath76@xmath860.4 ) , and g - af ( @xmath76@xmath1070.4 ) . for @xmath80=0.5 and @xmath65=0.8 , as shown in fig .",
    "8(a ) , the c - af phases are always observed , but they have different orbital structures . finally , for @xmath80=4 and @xmath65=0.8",

    "in order to understand the appearance of three types of the af phases , we may consider an explanation due to the combination of the changes in @xmath76 and @xmath82 .",
    "for instance , by assuming that @xmath80=4 for nptga@xmath0 and the change in @xmath76 for nptga@xmath0 is just the same as that for utga@xmath0 , we consider that @xmath82@xmath1122 with @xmath76@xmath860 for t = ni , @xmath82@xmath1121.5 with @xmath76@xmath1120 for t = co , and @xmath82@xmath1121.5 with @xmath76@xmath113 for t = fe .",
    "then , it seems to be possible to relate our theoretical af phases with the experimental observations in nptga@xmath0 .",
    "however , it is difficult to claim that the above parameter assignment for three np-115 materials is the best explanation for the magnetic structure of np-115 , since in actual compounds , there are other important ingredients which have not been included in the present model .",
    "for instance , we have never discussed the direction of the magnetic moment of np ion .",
    "especially , the canted af structure can not be considered at all for the g - af phase of npniga@xmath0 .",
    "thus , we need to recognize some distance between the actual magnetic states and the theoretically obtained phases . our theory should be improved by taking into account other ingredients of 115 structure .    in summary",
    ", we have analyzed the orbital degenerate model appropriate for nptga@xmath0 by using the exact diagonalization technique .",
    "our phase diagram includes c- , a- , and g - af phases .",
    "we have proposed the manganite - like scenario to understand the appearance of three kinds of af spin structure in np-115 .",
