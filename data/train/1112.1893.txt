    "in this paper we consider a class of one - dimensional interacting particle systems with a focus on ergodicity , i.e. , whether there is always convergence to a unique invariant distribution .",
    "the evolving state of the system is an assignment of colors from @xmath1 to the sites in @xmath2 and the transition probabilities of a given site depend only on the color of its left and right neighbors .",
    "we actually study a two - parameter , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , family of models which includes classic voter models with or without noise and stochastic ising and potts models at zero and nonzero temperature .",
    "together the two parameters control the rates of bulk nucleation of random colors and boundary nucleation when the two neighbors disagree in color .",
    "our main results are about ergodicity under various conditions on @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath0 .",
    "the methods we use are percolation - based and rely on the fact that the dual system is a model of coalescing random walks that also have branching and dying .",
    "we start by recalling the classic discrete time voter model in one dimension @xcite .",
    "the voters or particles are located at each site of @xmath2 and take one of the @xmath0 possible opinions ( or colors ) . at each point in time @xmath5 the particles make decisions on whether to keep or change their color .",
    "the decision consists of randomly choosing one of the two neighbors and adopting its color from time @xmath6 .",
    "the process of choosing a neighbor may be represented by drawing a random arrow to one of the nearest neighbors at time @xmath6 and thus the history or genealogy of the color of a particular site may be traced to time zero by the path of backward arrows coming out of each space - time site .",
    "the distribution of the genealogy paths is that of coalescing simple symmetric random walks .",
    "noise can be introduced in the voter model by having each site make a decision as before with probability @xmath7 or else choose a color uniformly at random out of the @xmath0 possible ones with probability @xmath8 .",
    "the genealogy of the noisy voter model is represented by the coalescing random walks with `` dying '' , where a path dies at a point where a color choice was made uniformly at random .",
    "such points , which we call bulk nucleation points , represent death of a genealogy path or birth of an opinion . if the opinions are + 1 or -1 , the noisy voter model coincides with the stochastic ising model with glauber dynamics .",
    "the models we consider in this paper allow for the number of colors of a single site to be any positive integer @xmath9 .",
    "the decision that each particle makes at each point in time has the two possibilities for a noisy voter model : one is to choose a color of a randomly chosen neighbor and another is to generate a uniformly random color .",
    "a third possibility is to take the color of the two neighbors if their colors agree or to generate a uniformly random color if they disagree ( boundary nucleation ) .",
    "a site where such a decision is made we represent by a double - arrow in the genealogy graph . to determine the probability of these three choices we introduce two parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "this model , for certain choices of @xmath4 and @xmath3 , is related to stochastic potts models with @xmath0 colors ( for the relation with zero temperature continuous time potts models see @xcite , with continuous time nonzero temperature ising models see @xcite , with nonzero temperature potts models in continuous and discrete time see @xcite ) . in the space - time coordinates the evolution of the system may be represented by coloring vertices of @xmath10 . since a color of vertex @xmath11 depends on colors of vertices @xmath12 and @xmath13 only , there are actually two independent systems evolving : one lives on the sub - lattice with @xmath14 even and another with @xmath14 odd .",
    "thus , we can restrict our lattice to be the part of @xmath10 which contains only vertices with @xmath14 even .    the special case where the number of colors @xmath15 is also considered . in this case",
    "it is convenient to view coloring as partitioning sites into equivalence classes of the same color rather than coloring the sites , and at nucleation points the color ( or equivalence class ) that is supposed to be assigned uniformly at random is chosen to be completely new and different from all the previously existing ones .",
    "the main issues that we investigate can be described by the term memory loss : to what extent does the system in the long run depend on the initial conditions .",
    "the existence of an invariant distribution is known for all lattice systems in discrete and continuous time and is based on compactness of the state space .",
    "see @xcite for discrete time systems and @xcite for continuous time systems .",
    "if the invariant distribution is not unique , then memory is not lost . limiting behavior",
    "will depend on the initial distribution as there are at least as many possible limits as there are invariant distributions .",
    "ergodicity means convergence to a unique possible limit for all initial conditions and is the strongest degree of memory loss .",
    "we prove ergodicity under certain conditions on the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath3 . for others",
    "the question remains open .",
    "for all nonzero parameters we prove a weaker type of memory loss ",
    "color permutation invariance of any limit or sub - sequence limit distribution .",
    "this shows that if one begins with all sites of the same color , any sub - sequence limit distribution does not depend on the starting color .",
    "there are natural diffusive scaling limit analogues of the model considered in this paper where space - time is continuous rather than discrete and random walks become brownian motions . some of these , such as the brownian web and net and related continuum voter models , have already been studied @xcite and others are in preparation @xcite .",
    "one reason we focus here on the discrete time model is because the only existing published result @xcite about convergence to these limits starts from the discrete time lattice model .",
    "another reason is to allow us to compare ergodicity and percolation properties of the model  see the remark following the proof of theorem 2 in section 3 below .",
    "we expect that the discrete model results of this paper can be extended to the continuum setting , but do not explore that here .",
    "we note however that there are a number of papers @xcite that treat related continuous time lattice models that also have a natural percolation substructure to their dual models .",
    "a formal definition of the model and presentation of main results is given in the next section .",
    "section 3 contains all the proofs .",
    "the proofs are based on the underlying directed arrow percolation process which traces the genealogy of colors .",
    "percolation methods such as dynamic renormalization ( see @xcite ) or enhancement ( see @xcite ) that we use in this paper are described in detail in @xcite . the enhancement argument",
    "we utilize ( see lemma 2 ) is a close adaptation of that of aizenman and grimmett ( @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "we present the argument in detail here because the percolation model that we are considering does not fall into the class of models considered in @xcite : our model is directed and there are more than two possible states of the arrows at each site .",
    "but it does fall into the class of models treated in @xcite .",

    "for each subsequent ( lower ) row following the initial row determine the colors of each vertex @xmath17 according to a rule that depends on the values of @xmath18 , @xmath34 and the @xmath36 values of the two adjacent vertices in the row just above of @xmath17 called @xmath37 for the vertex above left of @xmath17 and @xmath38 for the vertex above right of @xmath17 .",

    "we mean that the invariant distribution for @xmath40 is unique and that any initial distribution converges to it .",
    "the first question of interest is whether @xmath31-arrows percolate .",

    "it is shown that when the @xmath31-arrows do not percolate the @xmath40 process is ergodic for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "although we have not shown ergodicity for all positive @xmath3 , the following theorem extends the interval of @xmath3 for which the @xmath40 process is ergodic to some positive distance below @xmath56 where the @xmath31-arrows do percolate .",
    "thus ergodicity is not equivalent to non - percolation .",
    "@xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath9 , @xmath52 @xmath57 such that for @xmath58 , the @xmath40 process is ergodic .    to prove theorem 2 ,",
    "we will use ( see lemma 2 below ) an adaptation of the percolation enhancement arguments of [ 1,11 ] that allows us to directly compare two distinct critical values for the parameter @xmath3 : one for percolation and one for ergodicity .",
    "a weaker result is established for all non zero @xmath3 :    @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and any initial configuration @xmath62 , any sub - sequence limit distribution is color permutation invariant .",
    "this result does not imply convergence to a limiting distribution nor does it imply uniqueness of the invariant distribution as it is still possible to have different @xmath63-dimensional marginal distributions for @xmath64 .",
    "there are two special cases where the @xmath40 process is ergodic for all positive @xmath4 and @xmath3 . in the case",
    "@xmath65 , the ergodicity of @xmath40 is known .",
    "this follows from the fact that for @xmath66 , at `` @xmath29 '' points when the colors of neighbors disagree choosing color 1 or 2 uniformly at random is equivalent to choosing the left or right neighbor uniformly at random .",
    "therefore , the paths of arrows that are used to trace the color genealogy of each vertex are distributed as coalescing simple symmetric random walks with dying ( `` @xmath30 '' points ) .",
    "such paths are almost surely finite , and ergodicity will follow by the argument of corollary 1 below . for @xmath67 , instead of colored vertices the state space of @xmath40 may be considered to be partitions of @xmath2 into infinitely many possible equivalence classes that play the role of colors . in this special case",
    "the ergodicity is established by theorem 4 .    when @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath60 , the @xmath40 process is ergodic .",
    "the conjecture of ergodicity for @xmath61 for all @xmath51 and _ any _ @xmath60 remains open .",
    "first we clarify a possible source of confusion : the time ( row count ) for paths of arrows is in the direction of the arrows which is upward , but the time for the color evolution process @xmath40 is against the arrows or downward .",
    "this is due to the color evolution rules that use arrows pointing to the colored vertices from the past in determining colors for the vertices in the present ",
    "i.e.,the arrows track the color genealogy . throughout the rest of the paper we will choose the direction of time depending on whether we consider colors or not .",
