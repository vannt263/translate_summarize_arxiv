    "<S> in the horndeski s most general scalar - tensor theories with second - order field equations , we derive the conditions for the avoidance of ghosts and laplacian instabilities associated with scalar , tensor , and vector perturbations in the presence of two perfect fluids on the flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) background . </S>",
    "<S> our general results are useful for the construction of theoretically consistent models of dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our formulas to extended galileon models in which a tracker solution with an equation of state smaller than @xmath0 is present . </S>",
    "<S> we clarify the allowed parameter space in which the ghosts and laplacian instabilities are absent and we numerically confirm that such models are indeed cosmologically viable . </S>"
