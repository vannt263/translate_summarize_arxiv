    "the aim of this paper is to extend this result to all , not necessarily symmetric , norms in the plane . as usual ,",
    "such a norm is defined by a convex compact set @xmath3 with @xmath4 , and the norm of @xmath5 is @xmath6    let @xmath7 be the lattice of integer points in @xmath8 , and write @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) for the set of all convex lattice @xmath0-gons in @xmath8 , that is , @xmath11 if @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the vertices , in anticlockwise order , of @xmath14",
    ". the @xmath15-perimeter of @xmath14 is defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 by convention .",
    "note that for a non - symmetric @xmath15 , @xmath18 depends on the orientation of @xmath14 as well .",
    "define now @xmath19 since @xmath15 will be kept fixed throughout , we will often write @xmath20 and @xmath1 instead of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    in this paper we determine the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath22 for all norms .",
    "we will also show that , after suitable scaling , the minimizing polygons have a limiting shape .",
    "the same results were proved by maria prodromou  @xcite in 2005 in the case when @xmath15 is symmetric , that is , @xmath23 .",
    "we will see that most of the difficulties in the non - symmetric case do not come up in the symmetric one .",
    "define @xmath24 as the set of all positive continuous functions @xmath25 \\to { \\bf r^+}$ ] with @xmath26 .",
    "such a function is the radial function of a _ starshaped _ set in @xmath8 ; such a set contains the origin in its interior and the half - line starting at the origin in direction @xmath27 intersects its boundary at a single point which is at distance @xmath28 from the origin .",
    "we write @xmath29 for the set of all starshaped sets in @xmath8 .",
    "every convex compact set @xmath30 with @xmath31 is , of course , starshaped .",
    "we denote by @xmath32 the set of radial functions of all such convex compact sets .",
    "let @xmath33 be the radial function of @xmath15 .",
    "the problem of determining @xmath22 is closely related to the following variational problem , to be denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "we seek a radial function @xmath35 that minimizes @xmath36    assume @xmath28 is the radial function of a convex ( or starshaped ) compact set @xmath30 .",
    "then the first condition says that the centre of gravity , @xmath37 , of @xmath38 is at the origin , and the second condition says that @xmath39 .",
    "we will explain later the meaning of the function to be minimized .",
    "using the results concerning @xmath1 we will prove the following .    [",
    "th : var ] there is a unique solution @xmath40 to the variational problem .",
    "it is the radial function of a convex compact set in @xmath8 defined as the only function of the form @xmath41 with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , that satisfies the constraints of @xmath34 .",
    "notice that all the positive functions of the form @xmath44 are radial functions of a convex set .",
    "indeed , the sign of the curvature is given , in the differentiable case , by the sign of @xmath45 which happens to be equal to @xmath46 , which is always positive because @xmath15 is convex .",
    "this result can easily be extended to the non differentiable case .",
    "we mention further that the solution to @xmath34 is unique in a larger class than @xmath24",

    "assume that the vertices of a minimizer @xmath47 are @xmath48 in anticlockwise order ( which is the orientation giving the minimal @xmath15-perimeter ) .",

    "* this is very simple .",
    "one has to order ( cyclically ) the vectors in @xmath58 by increasing slope as @xmath59 .",
    "then the polygonal path through the points @xmath60 in this order is a convex polygon with edge set @xmath58 .",
    "uniqueness is clear.@xmath61    we call this construction the _ increasing slope construction_. here come our main results .",

    "moreover , it is shown in section 11 that the round shape found for @xmath14 in jarnik s case is obtained if and only if the unit ball @xmath15 is given by an ellipse having a focus point at the origin .    to avoid some trivial complications in the proofs we assume that @xmath15 is strictly convex .",
    "we emphasize however that the above results are valid without this extra condition .",
    "we make another simplifying assumption , namely , that @xmath74 this is just a convenient scaling of the unit ball which leaves the set of minimizers , and the corresponding @xmath52 , @xmath75 and consequently @xmath76 unchanged .",
    "the strategy of proof of the key theorem 2.2 is as follows .",
    "we put together the following ingredients :    * almost all primitive vectors of @xmath75 belong to @xmath52 ( section 7 ) , * the normalized convex hulls @xmath77 are sandwiched between two fixed euclidean balls ( section 6 ) , so that the blaschke selection theorem applies ( section 9 ) , * the radial functions of the only possible limiting points of the sequence @xmath78 are solutions of @xmath34 ( section 5 ) .",

    "we claim that @xmath14 has shorter @xmath15-perimeter than @xmath50 .",
    "this clearly finishes the proof .    to prove @xmath117 we have to show that @xmath118 .",
