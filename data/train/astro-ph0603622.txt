    "the correlation found between spiral arm pitch angle and rotation curve shear rate ( seigar , block & puerari 2004 ; seigar et al .",
    "2005 ) suggests that there is a link between the tightness of spiral structure and the central mass concentration in spiral galaxies .",
    "the shear rate , @xmath8 , a dimensionless quantity , can be measured directly from rotation curves and is defined as follows , @xmath9 where a is the first oort constant , @xmath10 is the angular velocity and @xmath11 is the velocity at a radius @xmath12 .",
    "the shear rate depends upon the shape of the rotation curve . for a rotation curve that remains flat",
    "@xmath13 , for a falling rotation curve @xmath14 and for a continually rising rotation curve @xmath15 .",
    "as the shape of a rotation curve depends on the mass distribution , the shear rate at any given position depends upon the mass within that radius , or the central mass concentration . as a result ,",
    "the spiral arm pitch angle is dependent upon the central mass concentration , and this is consistent with the expectations of most spiral density wave models ( e.g. bertin et al .",
    "1989a , b ; bertin 1991 , 1993 , 1996 ; bertin & lin 1996 ; fuchs 1991 , 2000 ) , although density wave models predict that pitch angles also depend on stability ( i.e. the toomre @xmath16-parameter ) .    the modal theory of spiral structure ( bertin et al .",
    "1989a , b ; bertin 1991 , 1993 , 1996 ; bertin & lin 1996 ) predicts that the tightness of the arms comes from the central mass concentration .",
    "galaxies with higher central mass concentrations , i.e. higher overall densities ( including dark matter ) , are predicted to have more tightly wound spiral arms .",
    "the models of fuchs ( 1991 , 2000 ) result in disks with rigidly rotating spiral modes , wherein bulges act as inner reflectors of waves or modes induced by the swing amplification method , thus leading to modal spiral waves , which form as a result of toomre swing amplification ( toomre 1981 ) .",
    "fuchs ( 2000 ) adopts a stellar - dynamical analogue ( julian & toomre 1966 ) of the goldreich & lynden - bell ( 1965 ) sheet , which describes the local dynamics of an unbounded patch of thin , differentially rotating stellar disk .",
    "he then increases @xmath16 in the goldreich & lynden - bell ( 1965 ) sheet , which has the affect that the bulge acts as an inner boundary .",
    "the result is that , instead of shearing density waves ( as in the unbounded sheet ) , spiral modes appear .",
    "these models best show how central mass concentration correlates with spiral arm pitch angle .",
    "if the disk is very light ( low @xmath17 where @xmath17 is the disk density ) the mode can be very tight , and we are in the domain of small epicycles .",
    "formally , if the stability parameter @xmath18 is close to unity , the value of @xmath19 must also be small , where @xmath19 is the radial velocity dispersion and @xmath20 is the epicyclic frequency .",
    "if we increase the relative mass of the disk , we find a trend towards more open structures .",
    "recent observational studies of spiral structure have highlighted a difference in the morphologies seen in the optical compared with the near - infrared .",
    "the classification of galaxies by hubble type ( hubble 1926 ) is performed in the optical regime , where dust extinction still has a large effect , and where the light is dominated by the young population i stars . in the near - infrared dust extinction",
    "is minimized and the light is dominated by old and intermediate age stars ( rhoads 1998 ; worthey 1994 ) .",
    "previous work has found that optically determined hubble type is not correlated with the near - infrared morphology .",
    "there is not a good correlation between hubble type and near - infrared bulge - to - disk ratio or near - infrared spiral arm pitch angle ( de jong 1996 ; seigar & james 1998a , b ) .",
    "however , even in the optical regime , the correlation between quantitative pitch angle and hubble type is weak ( kennicutt 1981 ) , even though the tightness of the spiral arm pattern , as judged by eye , is one of the defining hubble morphological criteria .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that near - infrared morphologies of some spiral galaxies can be significantly different from their optical morphologies ( block & wainscoat 1991 ; block et al .",
    "1994 ; thornley 1996 ; seigar & james 1998a , b ; seigar , chorney & james 2003 ) .",
    "galaxies with flocculent spiral structure in the optical may present grand - design spiral structure in the near - infrared ( thornley 1996 ; seigar et al .  2003 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the optical morphology gives incomplete information about the nature of spiral structure in disk galaxies .",
    "this is the basis of the near - infared studies of block et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and seigar et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    however , work by eskridge et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed that when assigning a hubble type to galaxies in several different wavebands , from the optical to the near - infrared , a correlation exists between the optically determined hubble type and that determined in the near - infrared .",
    "this suggests that , while there may be large small - scale differences between optical and near - infrared morphologies of spiral structure , the large - scale differences are minimal . as a result",
    ", it may be possible that there is no significant difference between the large - scale spiral arm pitch angle , regardless of whether it is determined in the optical or near - infrared for the regular grand - design spirals investigated here .",
    "it should be noted that for flocculent spiral structure it is difficult to determine a pitch angle for the two - armed component in the optical , while a @xmath21 grand - design structure may be seen in the near - infrared ( e.g.  thornley 1996 ; grosbol & patsis 1998 ; seigar , chorney & james 2003 ) . as a result",
    "it may be possible to use optical imaging to expand the sample of galaxies having quantitative measurements of spiral arm pitch angle and therefore strengthen the correlation between spiral arm pitch angle and rotation curve shear rate reported by seigar et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "in addition to providing an important constraint on models of spiral arm formation , the correlation between spiral arm pitch angle and shear rate opens up a fundamentally new approach for probing mass distributuions in spiral galaxies .",
    "this approach relies on imaging data alone without the need for full rotation curve information .",
    "specifically , the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) for spiral galaxies coupled with the shear rate - pitch angle relation can be used to determine a rotation curve normalization _ and _ slope . in this paper",
    "we explicitly demonstrate how , given a bulge - disk decomposition , a pitch angle determination , and a tully - fisher normalizaion , one can constrain galaxy mass distributions , dark matter halo concentrations , and other galaxy formation parameters .",
    "we obtain our constraints within the context of the the standard framework of disk formation put forth by fall & efstathiou ( 1980 ) and blumenthal et al .",
    "( 1986 ) .    in principle",
    ", the technique we demonstrate here can be applied generally to a large sample of galaxies and to galaxies at high redshift , when spiral arms are detected .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers in which we use spiral arm pitch angles to determine the mass distribution in spiral galaxies . in this paper",
    "we determine mass concentrations in a few disk galaxies from their spiral arm pitch angles ( or shear rates ) and their disk masses and scalelengths ( determined via a bulge - disk decomposition technique ) . in future papers",
    "we will apply the outline methods in this paper to a large sample of nearby disk galaxies and to a large sample of galaxies at higher redshift in order to determine the evolution in the central mass concentrations of disk galaxies as a function of look - back time .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the data used and the methods for determining spiral arm pitch angles and rotation curve shear rates . in section 3 we compare pitch angles in the near - infrared and optical . in section 4",
    "we discuss the relationship between spiral arm pitch angle and rotation curve shear rate found by seigar et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and we use more data to strengthen this correlation . in section 5",
    "we use a bulge - disk decomposition routine and an adiabatic infall model for disk galaxy formation to investigate the link between shear rate and central mass concentration and we summarize our findings in section 6 .",
    "we have made use of @xmath22 and @xmath2 band images of 57 galaxies from the ohio state university bright spiral galaxy survey ( osubsgs ; e.g. eskridge et al .",
    "these galaxies were chosen to be as face - on as possible ( with a ratio of the minor- to major - axis @xmath23 ) so that a comparison of spiral arm morphology could be made in the optical and near - infrared .",
    "we also include @xmath2 band images of 31 galaxies that also have measured rotation curves ( mathewson et al .",
    "1992 ; persic & salucci 1995 ) .",
    "we observed these galaxies as part of an ongoing survey of the 600 brightest southern hemisphere galaxies .",
    "the observations make use of the ccd direct imaging camera at the 2.5-m du pont telescope at the las campanas observatory in chile .",
    "integration times used were @xmath24 seconds . for this work , we selected from the full imaging dataset a sample of galaxies having a ratio of the minor- to major - axis @xmath25 , so that spiral arm morphology can be studied , and rotation curves are also available . of these galaxies , 6 also have @xmath26 band data .",
    "the @xmath26 band images were observed using the wide - field infrared camera ( wirc ) , also at the 2.5-m du pont telescope .",
    "a 5-point dither pattern was used with integration times of @xmath27 seconds in each position .",
    "the total exposure was therefore 900 seconds .",
    "we also include @xmath2 and @xmath26 band images of a further 3 galaxies from our survey , which do not have rotation curves .",
    "the selection for these galaxies satisfies the same selection criteria that was used to select the osubsgs galaxies above .",

    "using equation [ shearrate ] , we have calculated the shear rates for these galaxies , over the same radial ranges for which the fourier analysis was performed and pitch angles calculated .",
    "we have selected several different radial ranges , just as in the fourier analysis , and we present mean shear rates and standard errors .",
    "the dominant sources of error on the shear rate are the rms error in the rotation curve and the error associated with folding the two sides of the galaxy .",
    "this is typically @xmath45% . in order to calculate the shear rate ,",
    "the mean value of @xmath46 measured in km s@xmath39 arcsec@xmath39 is calculated by fitting a line of constant gradient to the outer part of the rotation curve ( i.e. past the radius of turnover and any bar or bulge that may exist in the galaxy ) .",
    "mean shear rates are then calculated from shear rates measured over three radial ranges , corresponding to the same radial ranges over which the fourier analysis was performed .",
    "the resulting shear rates are listed in table 3 .",
    "the choice of using 10 kpc as the radius at which to measure the shear and spiral arm pitch angle is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "the correlation between these two quantities ( seigar et al .",
    "2005 and figure 3 ) only exists when they are measured at a physical radius , chosen indepently of the disk scalelength .",
    "if we measure pitch angles and shear at a radius chosen using the disk scalelength , the correlation no longer exists , and the range of shear is narrower ( between 0.4 and 0.6 ) . as a result , we chose to measure shear and pitch angles at a radius independent of the disk scalelength .",
    "we chose 10 kpc ( although it could just as easily be 8 kpc or 12 kpc ) .",
    "the fact that this correlation only exists for a physical radius , suggests that other quantities may be important in the determination of shear and pitch angle ( e.g.  the disk scalelength itself or the stability of the disk as a function of radius ) .",

    "( 1999 ) and block & puerari ( 1999 ) , who argue that there is usually a large difference between the spiral arm pitch angle when measured in the optical and the near - infrared .",
    "our result is consistent with the result that hubble types assigned to galaxies in the optical and the near - infrared correlate well with each other ( eskridge et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we now analyze the absolute difference between the pitch angles measured the the @xmath2 band and those measured in the near - infrared .",
    "the mean of this difference in pitch angles is @xmath1 , where the error is a standard deviation , and this is therefore consistent with the same pitch angle being measured , regardless of the waveband .",
    "the mode of the distribution is in the range 0.5@xmath491.0 and the median is 1.46 .",
    "furthermore a linear fit to the data in fig [ opt - ir - pitch ] yields the following relationship , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the pitch angle measured in the near - infrared and @xmath52 is the pitch angle measured in the optical . the point at which this line of best fit intersects the @xmath51-axis is consistent with zero , and the gradient of the line is consistent with unity , and so the line of best fit is consistent with a 1:1 correlation between spiral arm pitch angles in the optical and near - infrared .",
    "it should be noted that although the difference between optical and near - infrared spiral arm pitch angles is consistent with zero from a statistical analysis , minor systematic differences can not be excluded .",
    "small differences between optical and near - infrared pitch angles have been measured of @xmath53 ( e.g.  grosbol & patsis 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , color gradients across arms may be caused by such small differences in pitch angles ( e.g. gonzalez & graham 1996 ) .",
    "of course , it is still a well - known fact that spiral structure measured in the near - infrared appears much smoother than that measured in the optical ( e.g. block & wainscoat 1991 ; block et al .",

    "may well be significant differences due to dust .",

    "a very good correlation still exists ( correlation coefficient=0.89 ; significance=99.75% ) .",
    "the shape of a rotation curve , beyond the turnover radius , is determined by the amount and distribution of matter contained in a galaxy .",
    "the increase of shear rates from low to high dictates a change in mass distributions from small to large central mass concentrations .",
    "the correlation with pitch angle is therefore interpreted as follows : galaxies with higher rates of shear present a larger central mass concentration and more tightly wound arms .",
    "in contrast , open arm morphologies are associated with lower rates of galactic shear and lower central mass concentrations .",

    "the differences in their favored formation models ( ac for eso 582-g12 versus non - ac for ic 2522 ) , halo masses and concentrations , comes down to a different measurement for their shear and the sizes of their disks .",
    "it is quite interesting that two galaxies , which seem so similar in size and hubble type , seem to inhabit very different types of dark matter halos .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the shear rate itself provides an underlying physical driver to push galaxies in drastically different dark matter halos towards similar luminosities .",
    "however , the problem would then be what stops such a drive and makes the galaxy luminosities so similar , when the halo masses show large differences .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that the shear rate adds an important constraint on galaxy formation models compared to what can be learned from standard tully - fisher constraints alone . indeed , the results for ic 2522 and eso 582-g12 are tantalizing .",
    "the first , with a low shear rate , favors a non - adiabatically contracted halo , with a low halo concentration and a massive , extended dark matter halo .",
    "the second , with a high shear rate , favors an adiabatically contracted halo with a high nfw concentration , and relatively low virial mass .",
    "these two cases motivate the application of the shear - rate constraint to a larger sample of galaxies .",
    "since shear is related to the spiral arm pitch angle and spiral arms are clearly detectable in disk galaxies at @xmath102 ( e.g. elmegreen , elmgreen & hirst 2004 ) , it is possible to constrain models of disk formation and dark matter halo structure back to a look - back time of @xmath103 gyrs , and evaluate how the mass distribution in disk galaxies changes with time .",
    "an important test of our modeling is how well the modeled rotation curves fit the data .",
    "figure 9 shows the observed rotation curves from persic & salucci ( 1995 ) overlaid with our modeled rotation curves . in both cases",
    "the rotation curve is modeled well in the outer parts , where we are measuring the shear . in the inner regions , where the bulge is important ,",
    "both rotation curve models overestimate the observed rotation curve , although the model for eso 582-g12 presents a much better case than that for ic 2522 . for ic 2522 ,",
    "the solid line represents a model rotation curve , with a bulge - to - disk ratio of 0.164 ( see table 4 ) and a bulge effective radius of 0.2 kpc ( as measured in the 1-d decomposition ) .",
    "however , infrared imaging of ic 2522 ( see figure 10 ) reveals that this galaxy has a bar with a major axis length @xmath1042 kpc ( i.e.  the radius within which the model overestimates the observed rotational velocities ) and a major - to - minor axis ratio of @xmath1042 .",
    "( it is common for near - ir imaging to reveal bars that may have been hidden due to dust extinction in an optical image , e.g.  seigar & james 1998a ; eskridge et al .",
    "2000 ; seigar 2002 ; seigar et al .",
    "the spectroscopic data taken by mathewson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) were observed with a slit aligned along the major axis of each galaxy , and in the case of ic 2522 , the major axis of the bar is well aligned with the galaxy major axis .",
    "the stellar orbits within a bar are such that the dominant motion is parallel to its major - axis ( e.g.  athanassoula 1992 ) , and so this will account ( to some extent ) for the low values of the measured rotation velocities ( compared to the modeled values ) within a few kpc . furthermore",
    ", if we double the effective radius of the modeled bulge , the resulting rotation curve is the dashed line in figure 9 .",
    "this still fits the outer part of the galaxy rotation curve extremely well , and the central velocities are not as badly overestimated .",
    "modifying the mass models in this way does not affect the trends displayed in figures 6 and 8 , it just affects how well the model reproduces the inner part of the observed rotation curve .",
    "this is probably because the main constraints we are using to model these galaxies are at a 10 kpc radius , well outside the region where the bulge or bar is dominating the rotational velocities . as a result ,",
    "the concentrations we determine from our modeling do not depend on the mass distribution assumed for the bulge ( i.e.  the mass distribution within the central few kpc ) .",
    "this approach is , therefore , a powerful and robust method , because its constraints are relatively insensitive to the details of bars versus bulges in the central regions .",
    "in this paper we have shown that near - infrared and optical spiral arm pitch angles are the same , on average , and as a result we have strengthened the correlation between spiral arm pitch angle and shear rate originally shown in seigar et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and expanded here using optical data . using an infall model ,",
    "we have shown that the use of rates of shear ( which can now be derived from spiral arm pitch angles ) allow us to put constraints on the total central mass concentration , the dark matter concentration and the initial nfw concentration . in some cases it may be possible to determine",
    "if the infall has to occur adiabatically or non - adiabatically , and this is demonstrated by ic 2522 which has to undergo non - adiabatic infall .",
    "this method can be used to determine the central concentrations of galaxies and to constrain galaxy formation models in any galaxy that has detectable spiral structure . in future papers",
    "we will apply our technique to a large sample of galaxies .",
    "furthermore , since spiral structure can clearly be seen in disk galaxies out to @xmath102 ( elmegreen et al .",
    "2004 ) , the evolution of central mass concentrations in disk galaxies can be estimated as a function of look - back time , and we plan to investigate this as well .",
