    "typical corrections were @xmath86 mag .    to assess the quality of our total magnitude measurements , we compared our measurements ( which are based on global backgrounds ) with those obtained using local backgrounds and found that our total magnitude measurements were @xmath87 mag brighter in the mean .",
    "comparisons with similar flux measurements made available from the goods and hudf teams ( giavalisco et al .  2004a ; beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ) also showed good agreement ( @xmath88 mag scatter ) , though our total magnitude measurements were typically @xmath89 mag brighter .",
    "we believe this offset is the result of the @xmath90 mag correction we make for light on the psf wings ( sirianni et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "while constructing our dropout catalogs , one minor challenge was in the deblending of individual sources .",
    "the issue was that sextractor frequently split many of the more asymmetric , multi - component dropout galaxies in our samples into more than one distinct source .",
    "this would have the effect of transforming many luminous sources in our selection into multiple lower luminosity sources and thus bias our lf determinations . to cope with this issue , we experimented with a number of different procedures for blending sources together based upon their colours . in the end , we settled on a procedure whereby dropouts were blended with nearby sources if ( 1 ) they lay within 4 kron radii and ( 2 ) their colours did not differ at more than @xmath91 significance .",
    "since sextractor does not allow for the use of colour information in the blending of individual sources , it was necessary for us to implement this algorithm outside the sextractor package .",
    "we found that our procedure nearly always produced results which were in close agreement with the choices we would make after careful inspection .",

    "meanwhile , our @xmath4-dropout criteria , while slightly different from that used by giavalisco et al .",
    "( 2004b ) , are now routinely used by different teams ( e.g. , beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we also required sources to be clearly extended ( sextractor stellarity indices less than 0.8 ) to eliminate intermediate - mass stars and agns .",
    "since the sextractor stellarity parameter rapidly becomes unreliable near the magnitude limit of each of our samples ( see , e.g. , the discussion in appendix d.4.3 of b06 ) , we do not remove point sources faintward of the limits @xmath97 ( goods ) , @xmath98 ( hudf - ps / hudf05 ) , and @xmath99 ( hudf ) for our @xmath4-dropout sample and @xmath100 ( goods ) , @xmath101 ( hudf - ps / hudf05 ) , and @xmath102 ( hudf ) for our @xmath5 and @xmath6-dropout samples .",

    "unless is a distinct population of star - forming galaxies which are much redder than these limits ( i.e. , the uv colour distribution is bimodal ) , we can conclude that our selection must be largely complete at bright magnitudes .",

    "the key point to note in the brammer & van dokkum ( 2007 ) analysis is that in contrast to our lbg selection their balmer - break selection should not be significantly biased against galaxies with very red @xmath10-continuum slopes . therefore , unless there is a distinct population of @xmath10-bright galaxies with minimal balmer breaks _ and _ very red @xmath10-continuum slopes ( which seems unlikely given that galaxies with redder uv colours have more dust , which in turn suggests a more evolved stellar population ) , it would appear that our census of @xmath10-bright galaxies at @xmath12 is largely complete .",
    "apparently , the very red @xmath453 population seen at @xmath424 ( e.g. , van dokkum et al .",

    "one generic concern for the determination of any luminosity function is the presence of large - scale structure .",

    ", we can not easily avoid coping with the effects of ly@xmath11 absorption on the @xmath65-band fluxes of @xmath6-dropouts in our samples , and therefore it is expected that our lf determinations at @xmath3 will be affected by uncertainties in modelling this absorption . ]    secondly , the value of @xmath24 that beckwith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) derive at @xmath1 ( alternatively quoted as @xmath537 , @xmath515 , and @xmath462 depending on the fitting procedure ) is significantly fainter than the values ( i.e. , @xmath538 ) that have been derived in previous studies ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 ; sawicki & thompson 2006a ; paltani et al .  2006 : see table  [ tab : complf4 ] ) . while these differences will partially result from beckwith et al .",

    "beckwith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) derive their lfs using the surface density of dropouts binned in terms of the flux in bands affected by lyman - forest absorption ( @xmath541 mag ) while other analyses use @xmath10-continuum fluxes where this absorption has no effect . as discussed in the paragraph above ,",

    "2006 report ) .",
    "third , at @xmath3 , we disagree with the value of @xmath20 and @xmath24 obtained by beckwith et al .",
    "our basic disagreement hinges on the assessment we made of the beckwith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) hudf @xmath6-dropout selection at faint magnitudes ( @xmath532 : see  4.3.3 and figure  [ fig : icount ] ) and our suspicion that this selection may be somewhat incomplete due to a flux bias ( figure  [ fig : icount ] ) . if indeed this incompleteness was not properly accounted for in the beckwith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) analysis , it would effectively lower their value of @xmath20 and brighten @xmath24 . again",
    ", this would shift the evolution in the lf from @xmath24 to @xmath20 .",
    "the unprecedented depth and size of current @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6-dropout samples , along with the great experience represented in the previously determined lfs from the literature , have enabled us to establish what we think are the most robust @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 lfs to date .",
    "these lfs extend significantly fainter than has been possible in all previous efforts that have not included the ultra - deep hudf data  providing us with unique leverage for constraining the evolution at the faint - end of the lf .",
    "these deep lfs put us in a strong position to discuss a number of issues which are of current interest in studies of galaxy evolution .",
    "having established the evolution of the lf from @xmath3 to @xmath1 , it is interesting to compare this evolution with that found at lower redshifts ( steidel et al .",

    "we look at this evolution in terms of the three schechter parameters @xmath20 , @xmath24 , and @xmath11 ( figures  [ fig : abmagz]-[fig : abmagz2 ] ) .",
    "this may give us some clue as to the physical mechanisms that are likely to be at work in global evolution of the galaxy population .",
    "the clearest trend seems to be present in the evolution of @xmath24 , which brightens rapidly at early times , reaches a peak around @xmath1 , and then fades to @xmath422 .",
    "the simplest explanation for the observed brightening in @xmath542 from @xmath3 to @xmath1 is that it occurs through hierarchical coalescence and merging of smaller halos into larger systems .",
    "not only do we expect such a buildup to occur at early times in almost any generic model for galaxy formation , but as we will see in  5.2 , such a mechanism predicts growth which is very similar _ quantitatively _ to that observed in our data .    at later times ( @xmath417 ) ,",
    "this steady brightening in @xmath24 halts and then turns around , so that after this epoch the most luminous star - forming galaxies become progressively fainter with time .",
    "this may be partially due to the gradual depletion of the cold gas reservoirs in galaxies with cosmic time ( independent of mass ) and partially due to the preferential depletion of gas in the highest mass galaxies ( e.g. , erb et al .",
    "2006 ; reddy et al .  2006 ; noeske et al.2007 ) .",
    "this latter process would cause vigorous star - formation activity to move from the most massive galaxies to galaxies of lower and lower mass .",
    "this process has hence been called `` downsizing '' ( cowie et al .",
    "similar `` downsizing '' trends are found in many different areas of galaxy evolution , from the decrease in the cross - over mass between spheroids and disk galaxies ( bundy et al . 2005 ) to the greater late - stage star formation in the lowest luminosity ellipticals ( e.g. , kodama et al .",

    "such trends are also observed in the evolution of the agn population ( e.g. , pei 1995 ; ueda et al .",
    "2003 ) , where the buildup of supermassive black - holes mirrors that in galaxy - scale star formation .    over most of the redshift range @xmath29 probed by current lf determinations ,",
    "we observe no significant evolution in the normalization @xmath20 and only a modest amount of evolution in the faint - end slope @xmath11 .",
    "the evolution in @xmath20 and @xmath11 becomes more substantial at the lowest redshifts being probed here , as @xmath20 evolves from @xmath543 mpc@xmath237 at @xmath544 to @xmath545 mpc@xmath237 at @xmath422 ( wyder et al .",

    ", we expect the value of @xmath20 to increase to compensate for the evolution in @xmath24 and thus keep the population of lower luminosity galaxies ( which appear to evolve more slowly with cosmic time : e.g. , noeske et al .",
    "2007 ) more constant .",
    "while we observe this increase in @xmath20 at late times , it is unclear at present whether @xmath20 is really higher at very early times ( @xmath548 ) .",
    "progress on this question should be possible from on - going searches for galaxies at @xmath549 ( e.g. , bouwens & illingworth 2006 ; mannucci et al .",
    "2006 ; stark et al .",
    "2007b ) .",
    "we have already remarked that one probable interpretation for the observed brightening in @xmath24 is through the hierarchical coalescence and merging of galaxies into larger halos .",
    "we can look at the hypothesis in detail by comparing the observed brightening with the mass buildup seen in the halo mass function ( sheth & tormen 1999 ) over this range .",
    "we will assume we can characterize the growth in the mass function by looking at the mass of halos with a fixed comoving volume density @xmath550 mpc@xmath237 and that there is a fixed conversion from mass to uv light ( halo mass to apparent star formation rate ) .",
    "a volume density of @xmath550 mpc@xmath237 corresponds to that expected for halos near the knee of the luminosity function assuming a duty cycle of @xmath78% ( see stark et al .",
    "2007c ; verma et al .",
    "2007 ) and @xmath20 of @xmath543 mpc@xmath237 , which is the approximate volume density of @xmath42 galaxies in the observations .",
    "the duty cycle tells us the approximate fraction of halos that have lit up with star formation at any given point in time .",
    "this analysis effectively assumes that @xmath20 is fixed as a function of time , which we assume to match the observations ( figure  [ fig : abmagz2 ] ) .",
    "we plot the predicted brightening on figure  [ fig : abmagz ] with the solid line .",
    "we note that these predictions are only modestly sensitive to the volume densities chosen to make these comparisons . at volume densities of @xmath551 mpc@xmath237 ,",
    "the predicted brightening is 0.6 mag from @xmath3 to @xmath1 while at @xmath552 mpc@xmath237 , the predicted brightening is 0.9 mag .",
    "surprisingly , the growth in the mass function is in striking agreement with the evolution we observe in @xmath24 , even out to @xmath553 where we derive our values of @xmath24 from the bouwens & illingworth ( 2006 ) search results ( see  5.4 ) .",
    "this remarkable agreement strongly suggests that hierarchical buildup may contribute significantly to the evolution we observe .",
    "while this is surely an interesting finding in itself , the overall level of agreement we observe here is surprising since we make a fairly simple set of assumptions above about the relationship between the halo mass and the uv light in galaxies hosted by these halos  supposing that it is constant and non - evolving .",
    "had we assumed this ratio evolves with cosmic time we would have made considerably different predictions for the evolution of the lf .",
    "this is interesting since there are many reasons for thinking the mass - to - light ratio might be lower at early times and therefore the evolution in @xmath24 to be less rapid with cosmic time .",
    "for one , the efficiency of star formation is expected to be higher at early times .",
    "the universe would have a higher mean density then and therefore the gas densities and star formation rate efficiencies should be higher . in addition , the cooling times and dynamical times should be less at early times .",
    "all this suggests that the evolution in the lf should much more closely resemble that predicted by stark et al .",
    "( 2007c ) , who also model the evolution in the lf using the mass function but assume that the star formation time scale evolves as @xmath554 . as a result of these star formation",
    "time scales , the stark et al .",
    "( 2007c ) model predicts a mass - to - light ratio which evolves as @xmath555 .",
    "this model yields significantly different predictions for how @xmath24 evolves with redshift ( shown as the dash - dotted line in figure  [ fig : abmagz ] ) . these latter predictions appear to fit our data somewhat less well than for the simple toy model we adopted above assuming no - evolution in the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "this suggests that this mass - to - light ratio may not evolve that dramatically with cosmic time .",
    "one possible explanation for this would be if supernovae feedback played a significant role in regulating the star formation within galaxies at these times  keeping it from reaching the rates theoretically achievable given the time scales and gas densities expected .",
    "of course , while it is interesting to note the possible physical implications of our observational results , we should be cautious about drawing too strong of conclusions based upon these comparisons .",
    "our treatment here is crude , and the observational uncertainties are still quite large .      given the success of our simple toy model for reproducing the observed evolution in @xmath24 , it is interesting to ask if this success is maintained if we consider more sophisticated treatments like those developped in the literature ( finlator et al .",

    "we were however able to estimate an evolution in @xmath24 by comparing the model lfs at a fixed number density and looking at the change in magnitude .",

    "finally , it seems worthwhile to discuss the implications of the current lf determination on the ionizing flux output of @xmath201 galaxies .",
    "there has been a great deal of interest in the ionizing radiation output of high - redshift galaxies since it was discovered that hydrogen remains almost entirely ionized since a redshift of @xmath3 ( becker et al .",
    "2001 ; fan et al .",
    "2002 ; white et al .  2003 ; fan et al .",
    "2006 ) and that galaxies are the only obvious candidates to produce this radiation .",
    "the situation has even become more interesting now with the availiability of the wmap results , indicating that the universe may have been largely ionized out to redshifts as early as @xmath578 ( spergel et al .",
    "2006 ; page et al.2006 ; cf .",
    "shull & venkatesan 2007 ) .    yet , despite galaxies being the only obvious source of ionizing photons at high redshift , there has been some controversy about the ability of galaxies to keep the universe reionized at high redshift .",
    "much of the controversy has centered around the fact that the escape fraction is observed to be very low for galaxies at @xmath579 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1995 ; hurwitz et al .  1997 ; deharveng et al .  2001",
    "; giallongo et al .  2002 ; fern ' andez - soto et al .  2003 ; malkan et al .  2003 ; inoue et al .  2005 ; shapley et al .  2006 ; cf .",
    "steidel et al .",
    "2001 ) , and therefore while high - mass stars in galaxies may be efficient producers of ionizing photons , only a small fraction of these photons succeed in making it out into the intergalactic medium . this has led some researchers to question whether high redshift galaxies are even capable of keeping the universe ionized ( e.g. , stanway et al .",
    "2003 ; bunker et al .",
    "we must emphasize , however , that the escape fraction is still relatively poorly understood , and that the true value may still be quite appreciable ( e.g. , shapley et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "fortunately , it appears that there may be several ways of resolving this situation  even for relatively low values of the escape fraction .",
    "one of these is to suppose that the traditional assumptions about the intergalactic medium are not quite right and that one should use a smaller value for the clumping factor ( e.g. , bolton & haehnelt 2007 ; sokasian et al .",
    "2003 ; iliev et al .",
    "2006 ; sawicki & thompson 2006b ) or higher temperature for the igm ( e.g. , stiavelli et al.2004 ) than has been assumed in many previous analyses of the ionization balance ( i.e. , madau et al .",
    "another possible solution is to suppose that there has been a change in the metallicities or initial mass function ( imf ) of stars at early times , such that these objects have a much higher ionizing efficiency than sources at lower redshift ( stiavelli et al .",
    "one final solution has been to assume a significant contribution to the ionizing flux from very low - luminosity galaxies ( e.g. , lehnert & bremer 2003 ; yan & windhorst 2004a , b ; b06 ) .    the present determination of the luminosity functions at @xmath12 , and in particular the steep faint - end slopes",
    "@xmath580 ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath581 ( @xmath2 ) , and @xmath582 ( @xmath3 ) provide significant support for the idea that lower luminosity galaxies contribute significantly to the total ionizing flux ( see also beckwith et al .",
    "previously , there was some support for the idea that lower luminosity galaxies may have been important from the steep faint - end slopes obtained at @xmath3 ( b06 ; yan & windhorst 2004b ) and at lower redshift ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "1999 ; arnouts et al .  2005 ; yoshida et al .",
    "however , this conclusion was a little uncertain due to the sizeable uncertainties on the faint - end slope @xmath11 at @xmath3  and some conflicting results at lower redshift ( gabasch et al .  2004 ; sawicki & thompson 2006a ) .",
    "now , with the present lf determinations ( see also yoshida et al .  2006 ; beckwith et al .  2006 ; oesch et al .",
    "2007 ) , it seems quite clear that the faint - end slope @xmath11 must be quite steep ( i.e. , @xmath404 ) at @xmath201  though it is still difficult to evaluate whether this slope evolves from @xmath3 to @xmath1 due to considerable uncertainties on this slope at @xmath3 .",
    "we can use the stepwise lf at @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 to look at the contribution that galaxies of various luminosities make to the total ionizing flux . assuming a luminosity - independent escape fraction",
    ", we can examine this contribution by plotting up the @xmath10 luminosity densities provided by galaxies at different absolute magnitudes ( figure  [ fig : relfrac ] ) .",
    "clearly , the lower luminosity galaxies provide a sizeable fraction of the total .",
    "what fraction of the total flux that would be provided by galaxies faintward of the current observational limits ( @xmath479 ab mag ) , assuming that the present lfs can be extrapolated to very faint levels ? with no cut - off in the lf , this fraction is 0.31 , 0.27 , and 0.40 for our @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 lfs , respectively ( from table  [ tab : lfparm ] ) .",
    "however , for the more physically - reasonable situation that the lf has a cut - off ( at a fiducial limit of @xmath408 ab mag , e.g. , read et al .",
    "2006 : see  3.5 ) , the fraction is 0.27 , 0.24 , and 0.34 , respectively . in all cases ,",
    "this fraction is substantial and suggests that a significant fraction of the total ionizing flux may come from galaxies at very low luminosities .",
    "in fact , even if we suppose that our high - redshift lfs cut off just below the observational limit of our hudf selection ( i.e. , @xmath479 ab mag ) , @xmath583% of the total ionizing flux would still arise from galaxies fainter than @xmath584 ab mag .",
    "since @xmath585 ab mag is comparable to or fainter than the observational limits relevant for most previous studies of high redshift galaxies ( i.e. , figures  [ fig : udflf4 ] and [ fig : udflf5 ] ) , this shows that most previous studies do not come close to providing a complete census of the total @xmath10 light or ionizing radiation at high redshift .",
    "ultra deep probes ( such are available in the hudf ) are necessary .",
    "over its years in operation , the hst advanced camera for surveys has provided us with an exceptional resource of ultra deep , wide - area , multiwavelength optical ( @xmath0 ) data for studying star - forming galaxies at high redshift .",
    "such galaxies can be effectively identified in these multiwavelength data using a dropout criterion , with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 dropout selections probing galaxies at a mean redshift of @xmath215 , @xmath2 , and @xmath586 .",
    "relative to previous observations , deep acs data reach several times fainter than ever before and do so over large areas .",
    "this allows us to investigate the properties of high - redshift star - forming galaxies at extremely low luminosities in unprecedented detail .",

    "this supposition would appear to be supported by complementary selections of galaxies at @xmath1 with the balmer - break technique ( brammer & van dokkum 2007 ) , which also find that galaxies have very blue @xmath10-continuum slopes ( @xmath452% of the galaxies in the brammer & van dokkum 2007 selection had @xmath421 s @xmath604 ) . since balmer - break selections do not depend upon the value of the @xmath10-continuum slope",

    "we employ a two part strategy : first deriving corrections necessary to transform the dropout surface densities from what we would recover for noise - free data to that recoverable in our hudf selections and second deriving corrections to transform these surface densities from hudf depth data to that recoverable in even shallower data .",
    "our use of a two part strategy enables us to ensure that the corrections we derive for the shallower selections are extremely model independent ( the most notable corrections being derived from degradation experiments ) .",
    "both corrections are implemented using a set of transfer functions , which correct the surface density of dropouts recoverable in deeper data to that recoverable in shallower data .",

    "is important because of the tendency for fainter , lower significance sources to scatter into our selection through a malmquist - like effect . to quantify this effect , we ran a series of simulations where we took @xmath4-dropout galaxies from the hudf , artificially redshifted them across the redshift selection windows of our samples using our well - tested cloning software ( bouwens et al .",

    "the assumptions we use in these simulations ( e.g. , size - redshift scalings , colours ) are the same as those given in appendix a.3 .",
    "now we derive corrections to take selections made with the hudf data to similar selections made with shallower data .",
    "we accomplish this through a straightforward procedure , degrading the hudf data to the depths of our shallower data and then repeating our selection and photometry at both depths .",
    "we perform these experiments for all three dropout samples and between the hudf and all of our shallower fields ( goods , hudf - ps , hudf05 ) . again , we express the results of these experiments as transfer functions , which correct the surface density of dropouts from what we would recover in the deeper data to that recoverable in shallower data .",
    "to improve the statistics at bright magnitudes , we performed similar degradation experiments on our other deep fields ( e.g. , hudf - ps and hudf05 ) and used those results at magnitudes where those fields appear to be essentially complete ( i.e. , ab mag @xmath606 ) .",
    "the transfer functions were binned on 0.1-mag intervals , and then smoothed along the diagonal .",

    "this will allow us to better assess the impact that large - scale structure could have on the current lf determinations .",
    "using the same @xmath82 methodology as we described in appendix b.1 , we repeat our determination of the lfs without making any large - scale structure corrections to the observed surface densities . the results are presented in table  [ tab : robustlf ] and are quite consistent with our fiducial sty79 determinations .",
    "this suggests that large - scale structure variations only have a modest effect on the schechter parameters we derive .",
    "thus far we have presented two alternate determinations of the rest - frame @xmath10 lfs at @xmath12 .",
    "each determination offered a different approach for dealing with the uncertainties that arise from large - scale structure .",
    "however , in both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 determinations , we have derived the lfs using the surface density of dropouts binned as a function of their magnitude at the same approximate rest - frame wavelength ( @xmath325 ) . for our @xmath1 @xmath4-dropout sample",
    ", dropouts were binned according to their @xmath64 band magnitudes , and for our @xmath2 @xmath5-dropout sample , dropouts were binned according to their @xmath65-band magnitudes .",
    "these two bands are sufficiently redward of ly@xmath11 ( 1216@xmath413 ) that they are not contaminated by absorption from the ly@xmath11 forest .",
    "this makes the determination of the uv lf relatively straightforward using approaches like the effective - volume technique of steidel et al.(1999 ) .",
    "unfortunately , when moving to our highest redshift @xmath3 @xmath6-dropout sample , it simply has not been possible to determine the lf in the same manner as at @xmath35 due to the lack of deep near - infrared ( j-band ) data to obtain coverage at @xmath325 .",
    "consequently , in our determinations of the @xmath3 lf ( here and in b06 ) , we had to resort to use of the flux in the @xmath65 band ( rest - frame @xmath324 ) as a measure of the @xmath10-continuum luminosity .",
    "the difficulty with this is that since the @xmath65 band extends below @xmath635 for galaxies at @xmath636 , flux in this band is significantly attenuated by the ly@xmath11 forest , and so it was necessary for us to carefully model the redshift distribution of @xmath6-dropouts in our sample to remove this effect .",
    "though this latter procedure should be effective in treating the effects of the ly@xmath11 forest , it is not obvious that it will not result in any significant systematics in our determination of the lf .",
    "after all , the results will clearly depend somewhat upon the rest - frame wavelength at which lf is determined as well as the model redshift distributions and assumed forest absorption model ( see appendix a.3 and b.7 ) . to verify that no large systematics are introduced , it is useful to repeat the determinations of the rest - frame @xmath10 lf at @xmath1 and @xmath2 but instead compiling the dropout surface densities in terms of their magnitudes in the optical passband just redward of the dropout band ( i.e. , the @xmath68 band for our @xmath4-dropout samples and the @xmath64 band for our @xmath5-dropout samples ) to parallel use of the @xmath65 band for our @xmath6-dropout samples . in this way",
    ", we will obtain a determination of the rest - frame @xmath10 lf at @xmath1 and @xmath2 at @xmath324 to match our determination at @xmath3 .",
    "the best - fit parameters obtained using this approach are as follows : @xmath637 mpc@xmath237 , @xmath638 , and @xmath639 for our @xmath1 @xmath4-dropout samples and @xmath640 mpc@xmath237 , @xmath641 , and @xmath642 for our @xmath5-dropout samples . here",
    "the value of @xmath24 at @xmath1 is somewhat fainter than in our fiducial sty79 determination .",
    "however , to make a fair comparison , it is necessary to account for the k - correction from @xmath217 to @xmath214 .",
    "the typical @xmath42 galaxy at @xmath1 has an approximate @xmath10-continuum slope @xmath421 of @xmath220 ( e.g. , ouchi et al .",
    "2004 ) , but at @xmath70 , the @xmath10-continuum slope is much bluer , i.e. , @xmath643 ( lehnert & bremer 2003 ; stanway et al .",
    "2005 ; b06 ; yan et al .",
    "this results in a typical k - correction of @xmath644 mag for @xmath1 galaxies and @xmath645 mag for @xmath70 galaxies , resulting in an approximate value of @xmath24 at @xmath214 of @xmath646 at @xmath1 and @xmath462 at @xmath2 .",
    "these values are in good agreement with our other determinations ( table  [ tab : robustlf ] ) , particularly when one considers the fact that the results of this approach are sensitive to the forest absorption model , large - scale structure along the line of sight , and an accurate model of the redshift distributions for each of our dropout samples .      throughout this paper",
    ", we have modelled the spectra of lbgs with @xmath631-yr constant star formation systems with varying amounts of dust extinction .",
    "we have used these model spectra to estimate the selection volumes of star - forming galaxies in our @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6-dropout selections . for our @xmath1",
    "@xmath4-dropout selections , the model seds were taken to have mean @xmath10 continuum slopes of @xmath220 at higher @xmath10 luminosities while at lower @xmath10 luminosities ( see appendix a.3 ) , the model seds were taken to have much bluer mean @xmath10 slopes in accordance with the observations ( meurer et al .",

    "bouwens et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) . at @xmath2 and @xmath3 ,",

    "2005 ; b06 ) .",
    "however , it is legitimate to ask how much our estimated selection volumes may depend upon the form of the sed templates .",
    "for example , we could have just as easily have modelled high - redshift galaxies using different star formation histories , dust content , or metallicities , even electing to model these systems as power laws @xmath648 .",
    "fortunately , these choices can largely be constrained by the observed colours of our sample galaxies , and in fact in our simulations of the hudf @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6-dropout data (  3 ) we find excellent agreement between our model results and the observed colors .",
    "even so , different sed templates only have a modest effect ( @xmath649 ) on the selection volumes of our dropout samples ( e.g. , see tables 9 - 10 of beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ) , particularly if we ignore concerns about the limited s / n of the data and photometric scatter . within @xmath650 mag of the selection limit ,",
    "however , the limited s / n of the data becomes a real concern and the selection volume can often be quite different .",
    "this makes it necessary to run detailed monte - carlo simulations like those described in appendix a.3 ( figure  [ fig : selfunc ] ) to compute these selection volumes .    to test the sensitivity of our lf determinations to the precise assumptions we make about the colour and @xmath10-continuum slopes of high - redshift galaxies",
    ", we repeated our determination of the lf at @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 assuming a mean @xmath10-continuum slope of @xmath651 and @xmath628 , with @xmath203 scatter of 0.6 .",
    "as in our fiducial sty79 determinations , we use @xmath631-yr constant star - formation models ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) with the extinction ( calzetti et al .",
    "1994 ) varied to match these @xmath10-continuum slopes .",
    "in general , we found schechter parameters ( table  [ tab : robustlf ] ) consistent with our fiducial determinations .",

    ", we found a significantly steeper faint - end slope @xmath11 ( i.e. , @xmath652 ) than we obtained in our fiducial determinations .",
    "a quick investigation indicated that this resulted from the fact that red galaxies have a significantly more difficult time satisfying our @xmath653 dropout criterion than blue galaxies , and therefore it is much more difficult to select red galaxies to fainter magnitudes than blue galaxies . to see whether our @xmath1 @xmath350 lf fit results were driven by the selection efficiency of faint ( @xmath654 ab mag ) galaxies",
    ", we repeated our lf determination but restricted ourselves to galaxies brighter than 28.0 mag . in this case",
    ", we recovered schechter parameters which were in good agreement with our fiducial sty79 determinations ( table  [ tab : robustlf ] ) .      another significant uncertainty in modelling the seds of high - redshift star - forming galaxies  and therefore estimating their selection volumes  is the distribution of ly@xmath11 equivalent widths . at @xmath47",
    ", it is known that only a small fraction ( @xmath78% ) of star - forming galaxies show significant ly@xmath11 emission , i.e. , ew(ly@xmath11 ) @xmath655 ( shapley et al .  2003 ) . at @xmath656 , the incidence of ly@xmath11 emission",
    "is thought to increase , both in strength and overall prevalence , though the numbers remain somewhat controversial .",
    "some groups , using a narrowband selection , claim that @xmath657% of star - forming galaxies at the high - redshift end of our range ( @xmath658 ) have ly@xmath11 equivalent widths of @xmath659 ( shimasaku et al .",
    "2006 ) , while spectroscopic follow - up of pure dropout selections indicate that the fraction is closer to @xmath660% , with typical ly@xmath11 equivalent widths of 30@xmath413 to 50@xmath413 ( dow - hygelund et al .  2007 ;",
    "stanway et al .  2004 ; vanzella et al .",
    "these results suggest a modest to substantial increase in the fraction of ly@xmath11 emitting galaxies from @xmath47 to @xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting to model the effect such emission would have on our computed selection volumes and thus overall determinations of the lf at @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we do this using the same procedure as we used in  3 , but assume that @xmath661% of the star - forming galaxies at @xmath35 have ly@xmath11 equivalent widths of @xmath326 .",
    "this fraction exceeds slightly the findings of the dow - hygelund et al.(2007 ) study above and was chosen partially as a compromise with the shimasaku et al .",
    "( 2006 ) work .",
    "the schechter parameters we find following this procedure are presented in table  [ tab : robustlf ] for our @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6-dropout samples . at @xmath1 ,",
    "these lfs have slightly lower @xmath20 s than similar lf determinations assuming no such emission . at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , however , the derived @xmath20 s are higher .",
    "this owes to the fact that ly@xmath11 lies outside of the dropout band at the lower redshift end of our @xmath4-dropout selections , but inside this band at the lower redshift end of our @xmath5 and @xmath6-dropout selections .",
    "note that we did not include such emission in the seds for our fiducial sty79 determinations since ( 1 ) ly@xmath11 can also be seen in absorption , not just emission ( which would counteract this effect somewhat ) and ( 2 ) the overall distribution of ly@xmath11 equivalent widths in star - forming galaxies at @xmath12 still has not been firmly established .",
    "the present dropout selections rely upon the presence of a two - colour selection to isolate a sample of high - redshift star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 and @xmath2 and a one - colour criterion at @xmath3 .",
    "these colour criteria were chosen to maximize our sampling of the high - reshift galaxies , while minimizing contamination by low - redshift galaxies . however , we could have just as easily chosen a different set of colour criteria for our @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6-dropout selections and computed our lfs on the basis of those criteria . to test the robustness of the present lfs",
    ", we elected to modify the present selection criteria slightly and repeat our determination of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 lfs using the methodology laid out in  2 and  3 .",
    "the criteria we chose were @xmath662 for our alternate @xmath4-dropout selection , @xmath663 for our alternate @xmath5-dropout selection , and @xmath664 for our alternate @xmath6-dropout selection .",
    "the @xmath4-dropout criterion above is the same as used in the giavalisco et al .",
    "( 2004b ) work and results in a sample about half the size of the present one , with a narrower selection window in redshift and similar mean redshift .",
    "the @xmath5-dropout criterion is similar to that used in our primary selection , except that the @xmath665 colour cut was lowered to make our selection more complete at the higher redshift end of the @xmath5-dropout selection window .",
    "the best - fit schechter parameters for these selections are presented in table  [ tab : robustlf ] and are in reasonable agreement with our fiducial sty79 determinations .      in this work ,",
    "we use the monte - carlo procedure of bershady et al.(1999 ) to model the effects that hi line and continuum absorption have on the colours of high - redshift galaxies ( appendix a.3 ) .",
    "we adopted this approach rather than the more conventional approach of using the madau ( 1995 ) opacities to better account for the stochastic effects that line of sight variations have on the colours of high - redshift galaxies and to take advantage of advances in our knowledge of hi column densities at @xmath223 ( e.g. , from songaila 2004 ) .",
    "this should make the present determinations of the lf slightly more accurate overall than we would have obtained had we not made these refinements .",
    "this being said , it is useful nevertheless to compare our lf results with what we would have obtained using the wavelength and redshift dependent opacities compiled by madau ( 1995 ) .",
    "this will allow us to ascertain what the effect of these changes are on the present results .",
    "repeating our determination of the selection efficiencies of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 dropouts with the madau ( 1995 ) opacities ( appendix a.3 ) , we find that our @xmath5 and @xmath6-dropout selection windows are shifted to slightly higher redshifts in general , by @xmath666 , but overall look very similar .",
    "the lfs we derive using these assumptions are presented in table  [ tab : robustlf ] and are quite similar to our fiducial sty79 determinations , except at @xmath70 @xmath24 is @xmath410.05 mag brighter and at @xmath3 the value of @xmath20 is @xmath4110@xmath38 higher .      in our fiducial sty79 determinations of the lf for each dropout sample",
    ", we assume that the lf does not evolve in redshift across the selection window of each sample .",
    "since we observe significant evolution in the lf over the redshift range probed by our lfs ( @xmath3 to @xmath1 ) , this assumption clearly can not be correct in detail . to investigate",
    "whether our determinations may have been affected by this assumption , we repeated our determination of the lf for each of our samples , but assumed that @xmath24 evolves by 0.35 mag per unit redshift .",
    "this evolution in @xmath24 is a good match to the evolution we observe in the uv lf from @xmath3 to @xmath1 .",
    "the values of @xmath24 , @xmath20 , and @xmath11 we derive at @xmath215 , @xmath2 , and @xmath586 assuming an evolving @xmath24 are presented in table  [ tab : robustlf ] .",
    "encouragingly enough , the values we obtain including evolution are very similar to those recovered without evolution .",
    "this suggests that the overall schechter parameters we have derived here are quite robust .",
    "nonetheless , there do appear to be small systematic changes in the best - fit schechter parameters if evolution is included .",
    "accounting for evolution , the @xmath24 s recovered are @xmath667 mag fainter , the @xmath20 s recovered are @xmath327% higher , and the faint - end slopes @xmath11 are marginally shallower ( by @xmath410.02 ) . since the inclusion of evolution in the determination of the lf is presumably a better assumption than not including this evolution , the lf parameters we adopt in this paper ( table  [ tab : lfparm ] ) will be from this section .",
    "the standard swml and sty79 maximum likelihood approaches allow us to determine the shape of the lf in a way that is insensitive to the presence of large - scale structure . unfortunately , since we do not have exact redshift information for the galaxies in our samples , we can not determine the absolute magnitudes for individual galaxies in our sample and therefore we must modify the swml and sty79 maximum likelihood approaches slightly so that the likelihoods are expressed in terms of the apparent magnitude for individual sources ( instead of the absolute magnitude ) .",
    "since the apparent magnitudes are related to the absolute magnitudes via the redshift and the distribution of redshifts is uncertain due to the presence of large - scale structure along the line of sight , our lf fit results will show some sensitivity to this structure .    to determine the effect of this structure on the derived values of @xmath24 , @xmath20 , and @xmath11 , we ran a number of monte - carlo simulations where we introduced large - scale structure variations upon a canonical mock catalog of dropouts for each dropout sample which we generated using the schechter parameters given in table  [ tab : lfparm ] .",
    "our use of one standard mock catalog for each sample was necessary to ensure that variations in the best - fit parameters only resulted from large - scale structure fluctuations and not poissonian - type fluctuations ( which would arise if we regenerated these catalogs for each trial in our monte - carlo simulations ) .",
    "we then proceeded to introduce large - scale structure fluctuations into this catalog . within redshift slices of size @xmath668 , we calculated the expected density variations expected for each of our dropout samples assuming the values of the bias given in  3.1 , made random realizations of these density variations , applied these variations to our mock catalogs , and then recomputed the schechter parameters using our implementation of the sty79 method . repeating this process several hundred times for each dropout sample , we computed the @xmath203 rms variations in @xmath20 , @xmath24 , and @xmath11 expected to result from large - scale structure along the line of sight . for our @xmath1 @xmath4-dropout sample , we found @xmath203 rms variations of 0.07 mag , 13% , and 0.01 in @xmath24 , @xmath20 , and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "for our @xmath2 @xmath5-dropout sample , we found @xmath203 rms variations of 0.05 mag , 12% , and 0.01 , respectively , and for our @xmath586 @xmath6-dropout sample , we found @xmath203 rms variations of 0.05 mag , 16% , and 0.04 , respectively .",
    "since the nominal errors from the sty79 method on @xmath24 and @xmath11 are typically at least two to three times as large as this , this structure only increases the uncertainties on @xmath24 and @xmath11 by a minimal @xmath327% ."
