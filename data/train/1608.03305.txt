    "<S> the structure of this state is markedly different from the low activity case . </S>",
    "<S> most filaments curl into long - lived spirals ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> if the system density is reduced , the state resembles a weakly interacting gas of rotating spirals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to ask why the system prefers this unusual spiralling state , as opposed to , e.g. , a configuration where perfectly aligned fully stretched filaments flow parallel to each other , which would be preferential energetically . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that it is ultimately connected to the conformational entropy of the chains : straight filament configurations are entropically costly and spontaneous shape fluctuations would affect the entire flow . on the other hand , the entropically favourable coiled conformations are not compatible with the self - propulsion which prefers coherent motion with a constant speed @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the system balances these two competing effect by selecting filament conformations that `` trap '' most activity into circular motion . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism has no analogue in systems of simple structureless active agents and owes its existence solely to the extended nature of the filaments , as can also be seen by reducing @xmath2 , which leads to the disappearance of the spiralling state @xcite .     for four values of @xmath50 . </S>",

    "<S> ( c ) ratio of active ( @xmath79 ) to passive ( @xmath80 ) persistence length for a range of values of bare bending stiffnesses . </S>",
    "<S> note that due to steric repulsions for low activity the measured persistence length is always larger than @xmath81 . </S>",

    "<S> legend in ( d ) also applies to panels ( b ) and ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 in all plots . ]    </S>",
    "<S> one of the identifying features of self - propelled filaments is the reduction of the effective bending stiffness manifested as the decrease of the thermal persistence length , @xmath81 . the active persistence length , @xmath79 , </S>",
    "<S> is determined by fitting the tangent - tangent correlation function @xmath84 to @xmath85 , where @xmath86 measures the position along the contour . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : struct - dynamic]c we show @xmath87 as a function of @xmath50 for a range of bare bending stiffnesses . for low values of @xmath50 , @xmath87 remains close to @xmath88 , indicating that the filament stiffness is not affected by activity . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the activity increases , one observes a rapid decrease of the persistence length . </S>",
    "<S> this activity - driven reduction of @xmath79 is accompanied by a drop in the radius of gyration ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : struct - dynamic]c , inset ) , indicating that the system transitions into a coiled state .    in order to characterise the spiralling state </S>",
    "<S> , we computed the average angular velocity of filaments around their centres of mass . </S>",
    "<S> the instantaneous angular velocity of filament @xmath89 was calculated as @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are , respectively , the position and velocity of the bead @xmath27 at time @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the instantaneous position and velocity of the centre of mass of filament @xmath89 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the average magnitude of the angular velocity per filament was computed as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the measurement time . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the order in which averages are taken is important to properly capture rotations of individual filaments , and also that @xmath98 retains a small but finite plateau at low @xmath50 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : struct - dynamic]d we show that @xmath98 increases sharply from its plateau value as a function of pclet number as the buckling threshold is crossed , confirming that individual spirals rotate . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of the increase of @xmath98 with @xmath50 grows with filaments stiffness , which is not surprising as softer filaments are easier to bend .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we explore how orientational order of semi - flexible filaments emerges from self - propulsion . </S>",
    "<S> steric repulsion leads to local alignment which does not depend on the filament direction and , therefore , has nematic symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , self - propulsion introduces directionality , i.e. , filament polarity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we compute both polar and nematic local order parameter of the filament bond vectors connecting consecutive beads . </S>",
    "<S> the order parameter is @xmath99 , with @xmath11 being the angle between a pair of bond vectors sharing a bead , and @xmath100 for polar , @xmath101 for nematic . </S>",
    "<S> the average @xmath102 is over all the pairs within a cut - off distance , @xmath103 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gr - nem - polar - polar - head]a we show the local polar order parameter @xmath104 as a function of @xmath50 . for low @xmath50 , </S>",
    "<S> the effects of activity are very weak and there is essentially no polar ordering . as the activity is increased , filaments align their propulsion directions and start to flow as a bundle , leading to a boost in @xmath104 for the intermediate values of @xmath50 . at large activities , </S>",
    "<S> the system collapses into the spiralling phase , and the order disappears . </S>",
    "<S> we observe similar behaviour for the local nematic order @xmath105 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gr - nem - polar - polar - head]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference is that at low activity the system exhibits substantial local nematic order , consistent with the passive polymer melt @xcite .    . </S>",
    "<S> spatial correlation function @xmath106 for the polar ( c ) and nematic ( d ) order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the upturn in ( d ) is an artefact of averaging for large @xmath107 . ]    in order to probe the extent of the local order in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gr - nem - polar - polar - head]c&d we show the spatial pair - correlations of both polar and nematic order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> these correlation functions are defined as @xmath108 . in all regimes , we observed an exponential decay of @xmath109 </S>",
    "<S> . there is , however , a clear difference between flexible and stiff filaments in terms of the extent of spatial correlations . for flexible filaments </S>",
    "<S> the order is indeed local and @xmath109 rapidly drops to zero at distances @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for stiff filaments , both polar and nematic order persist over much longer distances , reaching @xmath111-th of the system size . in the high activity regime , </S>",
    "<S> coiling into spirals , however , completely destroys the order even for the stiffest filaments .    in summary , we used langevin dynamics simulations to map a detailed non - equilibrium phase diagram of a two - dimensional melt of self - propelled semi - flexible filaments . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the activity has profound effects on the collective behaviour of dense suspensions of filaments leading to a number of interesting phenomena , including the onset of a weakly interacting spiralling state at high activity , which has no analogue in systems of structureless active agents . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to fully characterise the nature of the flowing melt phase , where one observes spontaneous formation of half - integer topological defects . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , it would be intriguing to explore if the topological defect develop orientational order akin to that seen in the experiments on active microtubules @xcite . in our simulations we were unable to observe any evidence of such ordering . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that this is due to the time scales accessible to our simulations , with far longer runs required to properly characterise this regime of very slow dynamics .    </S>",
