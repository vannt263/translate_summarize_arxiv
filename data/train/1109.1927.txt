    "a 4-dimensional interface cft is a scale invariant quantum theory where two same or different 4-dimensional cfts are connected by a codimension one hyperplane called `` interface . ''",
    "this is a kind of generalization of a boundary cft .",
    "interface cfts have been discussed in the brane configurations in the string theory @xcite , and in the ads / cft correspondence @xcite ( see also @xcite and references there in ) . the supergravity description , sometimes called `` janus , '' has been successfully constructed @xcite .",
    "later the classification and s - duality of the interface is discussed in @xcite .",
    "more recently 4-dimensional interface cfts ( or boundary cfts ) have been found to be related to knot invariants @xcite .",
    "let us consider a test particle in the interface cft .",
    "this test particle , in general , feels a force from the interface .",
    "this phenomena is an analogue of the force between dielectric substance and a charged particle in the electromagnetism .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate this phenomena to check the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . in the gauge theory side we consider the interface described by a fuzzy funnel solution or a `` nahm pole '' @xcite in @xmath0 super yang - mills theory .",
    "this interface connects two @xmath0 super yang - mills theories with the gauge groups su@xmath2 and su@xmath3 .",
    "the potential energy between the interface and the test particle is obtained by evaluating the expectation value of the wilson loop in the presence of the interface . in this paper , we calculated this potential at the classical level .    in the gravity side , this interface corresponds to a probe d5-brane solution of @xcite wrapping ads@xmath4 subspace in ads@xmath5 . on the other hand the wilson loop corresponds to a fundamental string connecting the ads boundary and the probe d5-brane .",
    "the potential is obtained by evaluating the on - shell action of this fundamental string @xcite .",
    "we will find that these two calculation agree with each other .",
    "this is rather surprizing result since the gauge theory calculation is only valid in small t hooft coupling @xmath6 limit and the gravity side calculation is only valid in large @xmath6 limit .",
    "this agreement is achieved because we have a parameter @xmath7 which characterize the interface . by virtue of this parameter @xmath7",
    "we obtain power series of @xmath8 in the gravity side ; @xmath8 is small though @xmath6 is large in the gravity side .",
    "the similar mechanism appears in the bmn limit @xcite .",
    "this mechanism also appears , for example , in the correlator of a surface operator and a local operator @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
