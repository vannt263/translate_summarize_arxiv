    "the demand for high data rates is ever - growing and it is projected that over the next decade a factor of a thousand times increase in wireless network capacity will be required @xcite . in order to meet this challenge , a massive densification of the current wireless networks characterized by the dense deployment of low power and low cost small cell is required , which will convert the existing single - tier homogeneous networks into multi - tier heterogeneous networks ( hetnets ) @xcite .",
    "hetnets that consist of different types of base stations ( macro , micro , pico and femto ) can not be operated in the same way as a single - tier homogeneous network ( consisting of macro base stations only ) and need some fundamental changes in the design and deployment to meet the high data rate demand .",
    "cellular networks have been designed mainly for downlink ( dl ) because initially the traffic was asymmetric ( mostly in the downlink direction ) . however , with the increase in real - time applications , online social - networking , and video - calling the traffic in ul has greatly increased , which necessitates the need for the uplink ( ul ) optimization . in current cellular networks , cell association",
    "is based on downlink average received power , which is viable for homogeneous networks where the transmit power of all the base stations ( bss ) is the same .",
    "however , in heterogeneous networks there is a big disparity in the transmit power of different bss , and the association scheme based on downlink received power is highly inefficient , therefore , the idea of downlink and uplink decoupling ( dude ) has been proposed for 5 g in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a simulation based study has been performed on two - tier live network where the ul association is based on minimum path - loss while the dl association is based on dl received power @xcite .",
    "this kind of association divides the users into three groups : users attached to macro base station ( mbs ) both in the dl and ul , users attached to femto base station ( fbs ) both in the dl and ul , and users attached to mbs in the dl and fbs in the ul . the authors in @xcite showed that the gain in ul throughput is quite high when the ul association is based on minimum path - loss .",
    "the gain comes from those users which are connected to mbs in the dl and fbs in the ul because they have better channel to the femto - cell and they create less interference to the macro - cell .",
    "a network consisting of macro - tier and femto - tier is studied using tools from stochastic geometry in @xcite , where the throughput gain due to decoupling has been shown . in @xcite ,",
    "the analytical results obtained from stochastic geometry - based model have been compared with the results obtained from simulation in @xcite , and they found that both of them match with each other .",
    "they also found that the association probability mainly depends on the density of the deployment and not on the process used to generate the deployment geometry .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that dude provides gain in term of system rate , spectrum efficiency , and energy efficiency . a joint study of dl and ul for @xmath0 tier siso network has been performed in @xcite , while considering a weighted path - loss association and ul power control .",
    "stochastic geometry has emerged as a powerful tool for the analysis of cellular networks after the seminal work of @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that stochastic geometry - based models are equally accurate as grid based models .",
    "in addition , they provide more tractability and their accuracy becomes better as the heterogeneity of the network increases .",
    "most of the work , which considered stochastic geometry - based model mainly studied the dl performance of the hetnets .",
    "for instance , single input single output ( siso ) hetnets have been studied in @xcite , and @xcite , mimo hetnets in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a complete survey can be found in @xcite and the references therein .",
    "however , only limited work has been carried out in ul because it is more involved due to ul power control and correlation among interferers .",
    "the ul power control is required because an interfering user may be closer to the bs than the scheduled user , which creates an additional source of randomness in the ul modeling .",
    "the correlation among interfering users comes due to the orthogonal channels assignment within a cell , which prohibits the use of the same channel in a cell . in other words",
    ", there is only one ue randomly located within the coverage region of the bs , which transmits in a given resource block .",
    "therefore , the interference does not originate from the the ppp distributed ues but instead from voronoi perturbed lattice process @xcite .",
    "the exact interference characterization for which is not available @xcite , and thus makes the ul analysis even more involved .",
    "an uplink model for the single tier network has been derived in @xcite , which uses fractional power control ( fpc ) in the ul .",
    "a multi - tier ul performance has been studied in @xcite and @xcite , where each tier differs only in terms of density , cutoff threshold , and transmit power . in @xcite a truncated channel power inversion is used due to which mobile users suffer from truncation outage in addition to sinr outage .",
    "the performance gain of dude is only studied for siso network and there is no work which studies the decoupled association in the mimo network di bruno s formula @xcite to find the high order derivative of the laplace transform of the interference , whereas @xcite does not consider beamforming gain in the cell association and use gil - pelaez inversion theorem to avoid finding the higher order derivative . ] .",
    "therefore , in this work we consider multi - antenna bss and we also consider ul biasing with the dude .",
    "the main challenge in modeling the ul multi - antennas hetnets , in addition to the generic challenges discussed above , is to select an analytically tractable technique from the number of possible multi - antenna techniques .",
    "we consider maximal ratio combining ( mrc ) at the bss and assume that the channel is perfectly known at the receiver .",
    "a receiver has knowledge about the channel between the transmitter and itself , but it does not have any knowledge about the interfering channel .",
    "furthermore , we consider power control in the ul , which partially compensates for the path - loss @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we consider rayleigh fading in addition to path - loss .",
    "we use a cell association technique with biasing , which can be used in any mimo hetnets .",
    "this association completely decouples the dl and ul association , and is generic and simple .",
    "cell biasing in the ul can be used to balance the load across the tiers .",
    "this association scheme is motivated by the technique used in @xcite for siso hetnets . due to the dude",
    ", users are divided into three disjoint groups as shown in fig .",
    "[ system_model ] ; ( i ) users attached to the mbs both in the dl and ul , ( ii ) users attached to the fbs both in the dl and ul , and ( iii ) users attached to the mbs in the dl and fbs in the ul .",
    "the gain in the ul performance comes from the last kind of users because they have strong connection to the fbs ( low path - loss ) and they create less interference to the mbs ( due to larger distance ) .        in this paper",
    ", we study both the sir and rate coverage probability of a two tier network where the association is based on dl and ul decoupling .",
    "the novel and insightful findings of this paper are as follows :    * the gain in term of sir coverage probability provided by the dude association over a no - dude association ( association based on dl maximum received power averaged over fading ) decreases as the difference in the number bs s antennas in the femto and macro - tier increases . when the number of mbs antennas is larger than that of fbs , the association region of a mbs is enlarged due to the larger beamforming gain provided by the mbs . as a result",
    "of which ues closer to the fbss become associated with mbss .",
    "these boundary ues , which are connected to macro - tier , create strong interference at nearby fbss when they transmit to their serving mbss . on the other hand ,",
    "when both tiers have the same beamforming gain , the coverage region of both tiers are the same and the interference created by the boundary ues is not that strong .",
    "thus , the dude gain over no - dude is high when both tier have the same beamforming .",
    "* it has been shown in @xcite that dude association improves the load balance and provides fairness in the ul performance of different ues . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that in the ul the optimal rate coverage is provided by the minimum path - loss association .",
    "however , we observe that in the simo network dude association does not completely solve the load imbalance problem and the optimal rate coverage is not provided by the minimum path - loss association . in the simo network , this load imbalance problem comes from the different beamforming gain of the femto and macro - tier , therefore , we still need biasing towards femto - tier to balance the load .",
    "we show that when the beamforming gain of the macro - tier is high as compared to the femto - tier then biasing towards femto - tier improves the rate coverage probability .",

    "<S> in order to improve the uplink performance of future cellular networks , the idea to decouple the downlink ( dl ) and uplink ( ul ) association has recently been shown to provide significant gain in terms of both coverage and rate performance . </S>",
    "<S> however , all the work is limited to siso network . therefore , to study the gain provided by the dl and ul decoupling in multi - antenna base stations ( bss ) setup , we study a two tier heterogeneous network consisting of multi - antenna bss , and single antenna user equipments ( ues ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use maximal ratio combining ( mrc ) as a linear receiver at the bss and using tools from stochastic geometry , we derive tractable expressions for both signal to interference ratio ( sir ) coverage probability and rate coverage probability . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that as the disparity in the beamforming gain of both tiers increases , the gain in term of sir coverage probability provided by the decoupled association over non - decoupled association decreases . </S>",
    "<S> we further observe that when there is asymmetry in the number of antennas of both tier , then we need further biasing towards femto - tier on the top of decoupled association to balance the load and get optimal rate coverage probability . </S>"
