    "observations with the effelsberg 100-m radio telescope began on 25 november 2003 and ended on 28 november 2003 .",
    "we used a secondary focus cooled hemt receiver with a center frequency of 8.35 ghz , providing two circularly polarized if signals with a system temperature of 25  k on both channels . with a sky temperature of 8  k , and a contribution of 33  k from the crab nebula , the effective system temperature was 70  k. two detection systems were used .",
    "first , a polarimeter with 1.1  ghz bandwidth detected total power of the left - hand and right - hand circularly polarized signals ( lhc and rhc respectively ) as well as @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "these four signals were then recorded by the standard * e*ffelsberg * p*ulsar * o*bservation * s*ystem ( * epos * ) . with the crab pulsar s dispersion measure of @xmath4 , we had an un  dedispersed time resolution of @xmath5 , while our sampling resolution was fixed at @xmath6 .",
    "epos was therefore set to continuously record data blocks containing 20 periods divided into 1020 phase bins for all four signals ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the minimum detectable flux per bin was @xmath7 .",
    "considering the dispersion pulse broadening , the detection limit for a single grp of duration @xmath8 would be @xmath9 .",
    "selected grps are shown on fig .  2 .",
    "a wide band ultra - high resolution detection system similar to the one of @xcite was used as well .",
    "the two if signals ( 100600  mhz ) carrying the lhc and rhc information were sampled and recorded with a fast digital storage oscilloscope ( lecroy lc584al ) . @xmath10 samples per channel",
    "were recorded at the rate of @xmath11 samples per second .",
    "the storage scope was used in a single shot mode .",
    "we used giant radio pulses to trigger data acquisition by the digital storage scope .",
    "the rhc signal was detected , amplified and low - pass filtered ( 3  khz ) , then passed to a second scope ( tektronics 744 ) .",
    "the second scope triggered the digital scope whenever pulses stronger than 34 times rms ( 75100  jy ) were detected .",
    "the recorded waveforms were then transferred to disk .",
    "this required manual intervention and led to a dead time of about 100 seconds after each pulse .",
    "about @xmath12 periods were observed with epos .",
    "presented results are only based on a third of all observed rotations .",
    "this selection was mostly caused by an insufficient quality of the data . because of the crab pulsar s weak signal at 8.35  ghz and the strong nebula background , ordinary single pulses were not observable with effelsberg at that frequency .",
    "it takes about 20 min integration to assemble a mean profile at that frequency .",
    "the giant pulses come in short outbursts , about 5 to 20 minutes in duration , and appear extremely prominent during such burst phases .    in our subsequent analysis , we set a threshold level of 5 rms = 125 jy on the sum of rhc and lhc for the same phase bin to count as a detection of a giant pulse .",
    "more than 1300 giant pulses were detected that way ( fig .  2 ) and",
    "their arrival phases were computed by using the tempo pulsar timing package .",
    "the data were aligned using the current jodrell bank timing model .",
    "they were found to be a perfect match to the time of arrivals ( toas ) obtained at jodrell bank before and after the effelsberg observing session .",
    "upper panel of fig .",
    "3 shows these phases .",
    "we found that the giant pulses occur at all those phases where the radio components of the crab pulsar emission are observed ( fig .  3 , bottom panel ) .    for all giant pulses , i.e. regardless of their phases ,",
    "the histogram of their peak strengths at 8.35 ghz can be described by a power law with a slope @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "this result is consistent with the results obtained by others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover in fig .  5",
    ", we show the phase resolved distributions of four components : two high frequency components ( hfc1 and hfc2 ) , and the main and inter pulse components ( mp and ip ) . because of",
    "limited statistics we could make a model fit only for the ip component , where a power law index @xmath14 was found , and it is consistent with the value of @xmath15 presented by @xcite .",
    "so far , there is no evidence that the distributions for hfc1 and hfc2 differ from each other .",
    "however , their slopes seems to be steeper than the slope for the ip component .",
    "the results obtained so far by us suggest that the physical conditions in the regions responsible for hfc emission might be similar to those in the main pulse ( mp ) and inter pulse ( ip ) emission regions .",
    "we plan to pursue this question further in the beginning of 2005 , when a new observation campaign at two frequencies , 4.85  ghz and 8.35  ghz , of the grps of the crab pulsar is scheduled .",
    "because of the burst - like character of the giant pulse emission and the long dead - times in our data acquisition , only 150 pulses were observable with the high resolution equipment ( for example fig .",
    "the peak strength varied from our threshold of @xmath16  75  jy to a few rare events which even exceeded 1000  jy . we computed dynamic spectra for the lhc and rhc signals by successive fourier transforms and squaring of the data .",
    "baseline and sensitivity corrections were also applied through the use of bandpass averages .",
    "the pulses were typically 25  @xmath17 wide and certainly wider than the resolution of our incoherent software de - dispersion , @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite showed the strong _ temporal _ variabilities within the giant pulses , which are possibly unresolved because of the limited bandwidth of the observations .",
    "although giant pulses can be received over a wide bandwidth , the individual pulses do not have a uniform spectrum , as seen in fig .",
    "the strongest emission was predominantly detected in the upper quarter of the accessible bandwidth .",
    "the individual pulses consist of @xmath19  mhz - wide clusters of narrow @xmath20  mhz spectral lines waxing and waning with time ( fig .  7 , upper ) .",
    "high frequency features appear earlier than low frequency features . furthermore , if two giant pulses occur in rapid succession ( fig .  6 ,",
    "7 ) separated by only @xmath21 , their spectra are similar though not identical .",
    "the maximum emission of the leading pulse occurs at higher frequencies than that of the trailing pulse ( fig .  6 , bottom ) .",
    "the separation of spectral maxima also decreases in the trailing pulse .",
    "intrinsic fluctuations of the emission process or - alternatively - scintillation could be the cause .",
    "the maximum flux of @xmath22 = @xmath23  jy is detected on a typical timescale of @xmath24 = @xmath25 . with the crab s distance of @xmath26 and accounting for @xmath27 bandwidth coverage ( @xmath28 = @xmath29 , @xmath30 = @xmath31 ) a peak luminosity of @xmath32 @xmath33 = 1.6 \\times 10^{25}\\rm~erg~s^{-1}$ ] is obtained .",
    "the pulse duration limits the size of the emitting volume to @xmath34 and a rough estimate of the dissipated energy density yields @xmath35 . for our observations",
    "the brightness temperature is estimated to @xmath36 = @xmath37 applying the relation @xmath38 in accordance with @xcite .",
    "such extreme brightness temperatures accompanied by strong polarization indicate a highly coherent radio emission process .",
    "we find that the grps occur at the same phases as the ordinary radio emission , perhaps dominating the radio profile at high frequencies . such coincidence suggests that the grps are of the same origin as the radio emission at @xmath39 . at these emission heights ,",
    "the interaction of relativistic particles with turbulent plasma wave packets in the pulsar magnetosphere represents a possible source process for the creation of grps @xcite .",
    "strong plasma turbulence is the highly non - linear dynamic equilibrium between density fluctuations and radiative plasma modes .",
    "the purely electrostatic two - stream instability parallel to the pulsar dipolar field serves as the trigger mechanism . in the pulsar magnetosphere ,",
    "electron - positron pairs are created in events which are sharply localized in space and time .",
    "each event creates an individual plasma shell .",
    "different shell generations have different bulk speeds and can interpenetrate the magnetosphere on the way outwards @xcite .",
    "in such colliding plasma shells , the plasma two - stream instability is excited , which evolves to a fully saturated equilibrium of turbulent plasma modes .",
    "self - induced , strong density fluctuations in the high - energy beam are coupled to density fluctuations in the low - energy background population via radiation pressure .",
    "such coupling leads to significant bunching of particles and thereby to coherent emission expected at a frequency of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the lorentz factor in the frame of the slower plasma shell and @xmath42 is the plasma frequency of an _ intrinsically _ relativistic plasma .",
    "the mechanism outlined above is attributed as _",
    "collisionless bremsstrahlung _ @xcite and is identified in self - consistent 3d particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations @xcite . in these simulations ,",
    "coherent radiation emission stimulated by strong langmuir turbulence is studied in slab geometry for similar conditions ( particle densities @xmath16 corotation densities of @xmath43 and lorentz factors of @xmath44 ) .",
    "turbulent energy densities reach up to @xmath45 with rise times and fluctuation timescales of a few nanoseconds .",
    "the emission of a fraction of this energy density is sufficient for the observed grps .",
    "the pic simulations show that the emitted radiation has a poynting flux with magnitude , temporal structure and linear polarization in good agreement with our observations .",
    "the radiation would last until the supply of high energy particles is exhausted .",
    "we would like to thank michael kramer for the kind supply of ephemeris and toas from the crab pulsar and h. wiedenhver and k. grypstra for their help with the lecroy scope and analog signal processing .",
