    "quadratic maps of the type @xmath0 over finite fields ( or rings ) are of great interest in both number theory and cryptography .",
    "they are used in primality tests such as lucas  lehmer and miller  rabin , integer factorisation methods like pollard s @xmath1 method @xcite , and pseudorandom number generation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  4 ) .    in studying these maps",
    "we will use the natural definitions and notations . for a map @xmath2 we let @xmath3 define the _",
    "@xmath4-fold composition of @xmath5 _ for nonnegative integers @xmath4 , with @xmath6 defined as the identity mapping .",
    "we call @xmath7 the @xmath8th _ iterate of @xmath5_. we will call @xmath9 a _ periodic point ( of @xmath5 ) _ if there exists some positive integer @xmath8 such that @xmath10 , with the smallest such @xmath8 being called the _ period of @xmath9_.    moreover we denote by @xmath11 the _ directed graph _ of the dynamical system of @xmath2 , meaning that the vertices @xmath12 is the set of elements of @xmath13 and its directed edges @xmath14 are @xmath15 for every @xmath16 . by the _ orbit of @xmath9 _ we mean the directed path in @xmath17 starting at @xmath9 , and with the _ tail of @xmath9 _ we mean the list of elements @xmath18 before we encounter a periodic point , and the orbit of this periodic point we encounter we call the _ cycle of @xmath9_.    in particular the dynamical system given by @xmath19 is well - studied and well - known",
    ". it has been of great interest ever since blum et al .",
    "introduced the bbs pseudorandom number generator , which uses this mapping modulo the product of two prime numbers . following this rogers in @xcite",
    "gives a formula to decompose the graph @xmath20 into its cyclic components and the trees attached to these cycles , and hernndez et al . in @xcite study and completely characterise the orbits of @xmath21 .",
    "similarly well - studied is the map @xmath22 , which is the one used in the lucas ",
    "lehmer primality test for mersenne primes .",
    "a bbs - like pseudorandom number generator using this map instead of the original @xmath19 has been studied by durn das and peinado domnguez in @xcite .",
    "results regarding the dynamics of this map were obtained by gilbert et al . in (",
    "* section  5 ) .    of note is pollard s @xmath1 method of integer factorisation , making use of any @xmath23 , which pollard in @xcite cautions should _ not _",
    "be used with @xmath24 , as further motivated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  4 ) .    of special interest to us is the results of vasiga and shallit in @xcite , where in section 2 and section 3 they study in great detail the dynamics of @xmath19 and @xmath22 , respectively . in doing",
    "so they obtain explicit expressions for what we will denote @xmath25 , the number of periodic points of @xmath21 in @xmath26 , the field of @xmath27 elements , @xmath27 being prime , as well as the corresponding @xmath28 , being the number of periodic points of @xmath24 in @xmath26 .    using these results they go on to study the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath29 being the sum of the number of periodic points for all primes @xmath27 less than or equal to some @xmath30 .",
    "they find that , assuming the extended riemann hypothesis , the asymptotic behaviour of both of these is @xmath31 which chou and shparlinski in @xcite show to be true even without assuming the extended riemann hypothesis . for a detailed working out of vasiga and shallit s results on a fairly elementary level , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections  2  &  3 ) .",
    "unfortunately , not as much is known about the number of periodic points @xmath32 of @xmath0 over @xmath26 when @xmath33 is different from @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and it is difficult to apply the methods used for @xmath36 and @xmath37which boil down to expressing the @xmath8th iterate of @xmath23 as a sum of terms of the form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 are some constants  in order to study other @xmath33 .",
    "having said that , there are certain results pertaining to @xmath32 .",
    "peinado et al . in @xcite",
    "find several different upper bounds on the cycle lengths of @xmath40 over @xmath41 , depending on the nature of the prime power @xmath42 and the coefficient @xmath33 .",
    "they also in ( * ? ? ? * propositions  3  &  4 ) find conditions for when this map has cycles of lengths 1 and 2 , depending on whether certain expressions in @xmath33 are quadratic residues in the given field .",
    "there is also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) in which nilsson studies the periodic points of all @xmath23 in @xmath26 for fixed primes @xmath43 .",
    "he shows that there are exactly @xmath44 diagonal lines in the so - called periodic point diagram  a means of visualising which combinations of @xmath33 and @xmath9 are periodic  that contain no periodic points at all .",
    "our approach is to attack the unpredictable behaviour of @xmath32 , @xmath45 from a different angle : instead of attempting to study @xmath32 directly , we are inspired by the asymptotic results of vasiga & shallit and chou & shparlinski and study experimentally @xmath46 the sum of the number of periodic points of @xmath23 for all primes @xmath27 less than or equal to some @xmath30 .",
    "we find a striking pattern in these for @xmath45 , and in particular this same pattern appears for all @xmath45 studied . based on this empirical data",
    "we formulate a conjecture describing this behaviour .",
    "finally we study the distribution of @xmath32 , finding that after normalising to @xmath47 they appear rayleigh distributed .",
    "we demonstrate the unpredictable behaviour of @xmath32 for @xmath45 in figure  [ fig : tcpchaos ] by comparing plots of them with plots of @xmath25 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is plain to see that @xmath25 and @xmath49 are much more well behaved .",
    "note also that the magnitudes of @xmath25 and @xmath28 are far , far greater than that for the other @xmath33 .",
    "the plots of other @xmath32 , @xmath45 , look similar to that of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , at least for @xmath45 between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we compute @xmath32 using the following fairly nave algorithm :    1 .",
    "create a list of all elements in @xmath26 , 2 .",
    "apply @xmath23 on each element in the list , 3 .   remove duplicates from the list , 4 .",
    "repeat from step 2 until the number of elements in the list remains constant .",
    "the number of elements in the list is now @xmath32 .",
    "the motivation for the algorithm is rather straight forward : if , at any point , two elements in the list are equal , there is no sense in continuing to iterate on both ; since they are equal , their orbits are also equal .",
    "moreover , for the number of elements in the list to remain constant , we must have that no two of the remaining elements map to the same element , because then the number of elements in the list would decrease .",
    "thus since all remaining elements must map to different elements , we must be stuck in cycles .",
    "it is worth noting that this is by no means a particularly fast algorithm , though it is fast enough for our purposes . computing @xmath32 for the first ten thousand primes for a fixed @xmath33 takes in the order of a quarter of an hour on our ordinary personal computer .",
    "in addition , since the algorithm needs to store a list of all elements in @xmath26 it also requires a considerable amount of memory for large primes @xmath27 . both running time and memory requirements could be improved upon by implementing a tortoise and hare algorithm like floyd s cycle finding algorithm @xcite or brent s algorithm @xcite .",
    "note that if @xmath54 , @xmath33 will be reduced modulo @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , for example @xmath55 since @xmath56 .",
    "because of this there is a certain amount of double counting when considering @xmath48 , since for example @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 will include the same term @xmath60 .",
    "as @xmath30 increases , this will of course become less and less significant .    using these computations of @xmath32 for consecutive primes",
    "@xmath27 we compute @xmath48 for @xmath30 up to and including the last of these primes @xmath27 , and observe something quite interesting : all @xmath48 , @xmath45 that we test appear to be asymptotically equal .",
    "we present experimental evidence of this in figure  [ fig : stcnequal ] , in which we look at the ratio @xmath61 for @xmath62 , with @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the @xmath30th prime .",
    "for the one hundred thousand data points collected for each @xmath65 , it appears as though these ratios all approach 1 .",
    "indeed , though not all are shown in figure  [ fig : stcnequal ] , all of the plots of this type approach 1 as @xmath30 increases , for any combination of @xmath66 .",
    "we observe the same behaviour , though on a smaller data set , for all combinations of @xmath67 , for the first ten thousand primes .",
    "since @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath63 appear to be asymptotically equal , it is natural to ask what they might be equal to .",
    "we arrive at what might potentially be an answer to this question by dividing @xmath68 by @xmath70 and finding that this ratio appears to be linear .",
    "we show this plot for @xmath71 and @xmath72 in figure  [ fig : stcsqrt ] .",
    "again we observe the same behaviour for all @xmath73 , for the first one hundred thousand primes for @xmath45 between @xmath74 and @xmath75 and for the first ten thousand primes for the rest .",
    "that these plots look very similar is of course to be expected , given how previous investigations suggest that different @xmath68 appear to be very close to equal for @xmath45 as @xmath30 grows large .",
    "now since the plot of @xmath76 appears linear , we would like to decide the slope of this line .",
    "it varies slightly , although not by very much , for our different @xmath45 between @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the smallest being roughly @xmath77 for @xmath78 and the largest being roughly @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "they all seem to be fairly stable around @xmath81 , which we observe by plotting the slope of the linear approximation for @xmath76 for the first @xmath30 primes , with @xmath30 taken to be @xmath82 in figure  [ fig : stcsqrtslope ] .    note",
    "that figure  [ fig : stcsqrt ] suggets that for @xmath45 @xmath83 where @xmath64 is the @xmath30th prime number and @xmath84 is some constant that figure  [ fig : stcsqrtslope ] suggests is close to @xmath81 .",
    "further note that since @xmath64 is the @xmath30th prime number , @xmath30 is the number of primes less than or equal to @xmath64 .",
    "we know from the prime number theorem ( see @xcite ) that this is approximately equal to @xmath85 , whereby we have @xmath86 which when multiplying by the square root becomes @xmath87    this  which it is interesting to note does not entirely unlike the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath88 and @xmath58 , shown to be @xmath89leads us to the formulation of our conjecture regarding the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath48 for @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath45 be an integer and let @xmath0 .",
    "further let @xmath32 denote the number of periodic points of @xmath23 over the finite field @xmath26 of @xmath27 elements , @xmath27 being prime .",
    "finally let @xmath46 the sum of @xmath32 for all primes @xmath27 less than or equal to @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath90 where @xmath84 is a constant approximately equal to @xmath81 .",
    "having found that @xmath48 , which is effectively averaging much of the hard to predict behaviour of @xmath32 by means of summing , we attempt to find out how @xmath32 is distributed for fixed @xmath45 . in order to do so we first normalise by dividing by @xmath91 , and then try to fit a distribution to the probability density function we get numerically for @xmath92 .",
    "we find that for @xmath45 between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath32 all appear to be rayleigh distributed with a parameter @xmath93 between @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in figure",
    "[ fig : rayleigh ] we show two of the probability density histograms and the matched rayleigh distribution . for the remaining @xmath33",
    "studied they all look very similar .",
    "given how our conjecture singles out the known cases @xmath36 and @xmath37 and suggests that all other @xmath33 behave similarly , it would be interesting to know if there are other outliers like @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "for the @xmath33 between @xmath52 and @xmath53 studied , this appears to not be the case .",
    "indeed , for these @xmath33 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 being the ten thousandth prime , varies between @xmath98 and @xmath99 . for reference ,",
    "the values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 are both in the order of @xmath102 .",
    "further comments are warranted on the consequences of the conjecture being true .",
    "an immediate consequence is of course that @xmath48 would behave the same for all @xmath45 , which would be very interesting .",
    "it would mean that despite the individual @xmath32 being hard to attack there is some meaningful connection between them for different @xmath33 .",
    "it is also interesting that @xmath89 , the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath88 and @xmath58 , is so much greater than @xmath103 , the conjectured asymptotic behaviour for @xmath48 for other @xmath33 . whilst this",
    "does not necessarily imply anything directly related to the applications discussed , such as integer factorisation and pseudorandom number generation , it does suggest that @xmath32 is usually _ much _ smaller when @xmath45 than when @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "this would mean that for a psuedorandom number generator like bbs , where we rely on large cycle lengths in order to not repeat our pseudorandom sequences too often , these maps @xmath0 for @xmath45 might not be very effective generators ; @xmath32 being smaller for @xmath45 does not mean that all cycles are shorter , whence these generators need nt always be worse , but since we have more irregular dynamics for these @xmath33 , we expect it to often be the case .",
    "our conjecture being true might help to resolve this . in the same sense",
    "as one might use approximations of the prime counting function to estimate the number of primes in a certain interval , an approximation of @xmath48 , @xmath45 could be used to estimate the number of periodic points for @xmath23 over fields @xmath26 , for @xmath27 in some interval . using",
    "this one can estimate the size of @xmath32 for @xmath45 .",
    "using such an estimate one could approximate @xmath105 of the terms in the above sum , together with the known explicit expressions for @xmath25 and @xmath28 for the remaining two terms , and thereby describe the approximate behaviour of the sum .",
    "we close this by mentioning that at a cursory glance it would appear as though these sums of number of periodic points for all primes less than or equal to some @xmath30 are well behaved not only for quadratic dynamical systems @xmath0 , but also for larger exponents .",
    "we studied briefly the behaviour of these sums for @xmath106 , for @xmath33 between @xmath34 and @xmath53 , where again we saw very similar behaviour for all @xmath107@xmath36 again being the odd one out , naturally having many more periodic points ",
    "however for these maps we have not studied it to closely as to come up with a potential expression for the asymptotic behaviour of the sum .",
