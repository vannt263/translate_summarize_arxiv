    "the thirring model is a four - fermi theory with current - current interaction defined by the following continuum lagrangian : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are four - fomponent spinors , @xmath3 is a bare mass , and @xmath4 runs over @xmath5 fermion species .    as in the case of the gross - neveu model ( gn )",
    ", nave power counting suggests that the theory is not renormalizable in the usual perturbative expansion in powers of the coupling constant .",
    "nonetheless , different approaches might allow a continuum limit to be defined for these theories .",
    "it has been established , using the @xmath6 expansion , that gn is renormalizable to all orders , showing an interesting phase structure with an uv fixed point of rg , spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking with dynamical mass generation and a spectrum of mesonic bound states .    for the thirring model",
    "the situation is less clear .",
    "the @xmath6 expansion turns out to be renormalizable ( at least at leading order ) , but neither chiral symmetry breaking nor charge renormalization are observed ( the @xmath7-function vanishes identically for all values of the bare coupling ) . on the other hand",
    "chiral symmetry breaking and dynamical mass generation are expected at some critical value of the coupling @xmath8 , from the solution of schwinger - dyson equations . however , in order to solve these equations , one has to use some ansatz for the 1-pi vertex function . according to the chosen ansatz",
    ", the functional dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath5 turns out to be different .",
    "this inconsistent picture can be clarified by a lattice study of the model .",
    "the existence of a non - gaussian fixed point , allowing a strongly interacting theory with dynamical mass generation to be defined , would be of great theoretical interest .",
    "it has a phenomenological relevance for model - building beyond the standard model and it can describe high-@xmath10 superconductivity and the ir behaviour of @xmath11 . besides , due to its relative simplicity , the 3-d model is an ideal laboratory to compare different non - perturbative approaches and to test algorithms for simulating dynamical fermions .",
    "we simulate the theory using @xmath12 species of staggered fermions and a _ non - compact _ action : @xmath13 \\chi_i(x+\\mu ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\mbox{h.c.}+ m \\sum \\bar\\chi_i \\chi_i + \\frac{n}{4g^2 } \\sum a^{2}_{\\mu } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath14 this is equivalent to the _ compact _ formulation where the interaction term becomes @xmath15 and the mass term for the vector field is no longer needed .",
    "both lattice formulations have their drawbacks . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the compact version generates higher order interactions ( six fermions vertices ) when the auxiliary field is integrated out .",
    "the non - compact one has an additive charge renormalization , preventing to perform numerical simulations at arbitrary strong coupling ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the data are obtained , as usual , from numerical simulations at finite values of the bare mass and on finite lattices . in order to study dynamical mass generation",
    ", we need to consider the @xmath17 limit , while we also have to take into account the relevance of finite size effects .",
    "the only assumption we are going to make in analyzing our data is that the rg flow for the thirring model is similar to the one observed for gn : we therefore expect to have a critical coupling @xmath18 , corresponding to an uv fixed point , where a chiral symmetry breaking phase transition occurs , separating a massless phase at weak coupling from a massive one at strong coupling .",
    "being below the upper critical dimensions ( @xmath19 ) , one can solve the rge without worrying about logarithmic corrections to scaling .",
    "an equation of state can then be derived using the solution of the rg equations for the external magnetic field at given magnetization  @xcite . in our case , the external , symmetry - breaking field ,",
    "is the bare mass @xmath3 , and the magnetization is the order parameter monitoring the symmetry breaking , i.e. the chiral condensate . in terms of the scaled variables ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a universal scaling function .    in order to take into account finite size effects",
    ", we introduce the volume of the lattice as a scaling field of dimension @xmath23 .",
    "the scaling function depends now on two independent combinations of rescaled variables : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the linear size of the lattice .    in the limits",
    "@xmath26 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 , eq .  (",
    "[ eq : eos ] ) reproduces the usual definitions of the critical exponents @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath7 .",
    "neglecting the finite - size correction and performing a taylor expansion of @xmath22 for small @xmath31 , one obtains a five parameter equation to which the lattice data at fixed lattice volume can be fitted , allowing the critical exponents introduced above to be determined : @xmath32 our results for @xmath33 are reported in tab  ( [ tab : fit ] ) , where fit i corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit1 ] ) , while for fit ii we set @xmath34 , as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "it is intersting to remark that , within errors , the hypothesis underlying fit ii is compatible with the result obtained with @xmath7 as a free parameter . since eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit1 ] ) is obtained from a taylor expansion , we expect it to be valid only for a limited range of @xmath31 values .",
    "the number of points included in our fits has been chosen in order to minimize the @xmath35/dof .",
    "the good quality of the fit can be seen as an evidence in favour of the description of the phase structure of the thirring model in terms of a non - gaussian , uv stable , fixed point .",
    "moreover , the critical exponents are significantly different from their mean - field values ; i.e. the continuum theory defined by the lattice model is not trivial .    ",
