    "the cms and atlas collaborations at the lhc have searched for resonant or non - resonant effects beyond the sm , see e.g  @xcite .",
    "the backgrounds at high invariant masses are dominated by the drell - yan ( dy ) process of opposite sign lepton pair production , mediated through photon or z exchange from the initial partons in the incoming protons . an alternative route to produce lepton pairs is in gamma - gamma collisions , where photons radiated by the incoming protons collide . to calculate this process , usually labeled photon - induced ( pi ) background in various searches ,",
    "we need parton density functions ( pdf ) of the protons including the photon component . a similar process , two - photon collisions , where the photons originate from electrons and positrons , has been studied extensively e.g. at lep2  @xcite .",
    "the hint for a diphoton excess  @xcite at a mass around 750  gev , reported by the atlas and cms collaborations from the analysis of the 2015 data at 13 tev , has sparked a flurry of phenomenological activity .",
    "one hypothesis is that a spin 0 scalar is produced through gamma - gamma collisions  @xcite .",
    "clearly a good theoretical understanding and measurements at these energies can help to elucidate this hypothesis .",
    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) introduces corrections to the parton evolution . as a result",
    ", we have to include photon parton distributions @xmath0 for the proton and the neutron , and part of the proton ( neutron ) momentum is carried by the photons .",
    "the pdf depends on the parton momentum fraction - bjorken @xmath1 , and the momentum transfer @xmath2 .    in  @xcite a global analysis of deep inelastic and hard scattering data",
    "was performed and the photon pdf was extracted .",
    "it is available from the lhapdf library  @xcite as mrst2004qed .",
    "this pdf set uses a model for the starting distribution at momentum transfer @xmath3  1  gev@xmath4 . for the photon radiation cutoff",

    "the authors of  @xcite argue that , photon radiation being a perturbative qed effect , current quark masses are more appropriate ; correspondingly this option is the default member  0 .",
    "they support this argument with an analysis of the then available zeus collaboration data  @xcite for the reaction : @xmath5 measured in a narrow range around @xmath6 .",
    "this is the most direct measurement of the photon pdf , as the photon contribution is at the leading perturbative order .    in",

    "w and z production at the lhc the photon contribution is suppressed by a factor o(@xmath10 compared to the canonical quark - antiquark contribution , thus providing relatively weak constraints on the photon pdf , especially where high precision data is scarce , e.g. at high masses or high x values .",
    "the sensitivity can be improved in measurements where the photon contribution is enhanced by selecting exclusive dimuon pair production in elastic , single dissociative and double dissociative pp collisions  @xcite .",

    "most of the presented plots show ratios of cross sections where some uncertainties cancel , and the influence of missing higher orders is reduced .",

    "dy '' acceptance : relatively soft cuts suitable also for low masses are used - asymmetric cuts on the transverse momenta @xmath15  gev for the harder ( softer ) lepton are applied .",
    "these cuts allow precision measurements both above and below the z peak .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig01 ] the differential cross sections as function of mass are shown .",
    "the substantial differences at higher masses are visible even in this double logarithmic scale plot . as the validity range of mrst2004qed",
    "is limited by @xmath16  =  3162.28  gev , we show plots up to this value .",
    "this covers early searches but will not be sufficient with the accumulation of lhc luminosity at 13  tev .",
    "it is possible to extrapolate to higher masses , or alternatively use the newest photon pdfs like ct14qed .",
    "it is worth noting that the absolute values of the cross sections do not agree with the values presented in  @xcite , see e.g. their figure  23 .",
    "it appears that the differential cross section there is not properly normalized , and it exhibits an unphysical `` kink '' around 1.2  tev .    in figure  [ fig : fig02 ] the predictions for the cross section ratio ( dy+pi)/dy for different photon pdfs are shown in the search acceptance .",
    "the bottom plot shows the same ratios including the pdf uncertainty for nnpdf23qed .",
    "as can be seen , the latter predictions differ substantially from the mrst2004qed results , especially at masses above 1  tev . moreover , the pdf uncertainty exceeds the size of the pi effect , limiting the predictive power of this calculation .",
    "clearly this is related to the lack of experimental data at high momentum transfers , the accumulation of much more data in run  2 certainly will help .",
    "the cross sections in the dy acceptance for the two members of mrst2004qed are compared in detail in figure  [ fig : fig03 ] .",
    "the dy predictions are almost identical , as expected , while the ( dy+pi ) results differ substantially .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the experimental data favor the mem1 option , producing the smallest pi effects .    in figure  [",
    "fig : fig04 ] the cross sections in the search acceptance for the two members of mrst2004qed are compared in detail . again the dy predictions are almost identical , as expected , while the ( dy+pi ) results differ substantially .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the experimental data favor the mem1 option , producing the smallest pi effects , important for resonant and especially for non - resonant searches in the tev region .",
    "an important question arises : can the pi background be suppressed by a set of cuts which does not reduce substantially the signal efficiency .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fig05 ] , the harder @xmath17 cuts on the outgoing leptons do not reduce the ( dy+pi ) cross sections above @xmath18  400  gev , so they have no impact on the interesting high mass region .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig06 ] the rapidity distribution of the ratio ( dy+pi)/dy using mrst2004qed mem1 for two invariant mass bins is shown .",
    "the first bin is chosen to include the region where the atlas and cms collaborations have reported a hint for a diphoton excess in the first run  2 data .",
    "the pi effects are small for this bin , peaking in the center of the detector , almost vanishing at rapidities @xmath19  2 , and rising again at the acceptance edges .",
    "the rapidity ( y ) distribution is symmetric around zero , as expected .",
    "this is a good technical check that the calculation has been performed to high enough precision , here to relative precision 0.1% .",
    "if the integration accuracy of the semi - analytic calculation is not high enough , fluctuations and asymmetries begin to appear .",
    "the second bin is a typical search bin from 23  tev ; here again the pi effects are strongest in the center and are diminishing at the acceptance edges .",
    "as the acceptance interval is shorter , the pi effects have no room to rise again .",
    "the fact that at high mass the pi effects are strongest in the center of the detector makes their suppression very difficult .",
    "in addition , as these effects are small , especially if mrst2004qed mem1 is used , there appears to be no pressing need for additional cuts , which could reduce the signal efficiency .    in figure  [ fig : fig07 ] the rapidity distribution of the ratio ( dy+pi)/dy using nnpdf23qed for the same two invariant mass bins is shown .",
    "this time the pi effects are substantially higher for the first bin , again peaking in the center of the detector , reduced at rapidities @xmath19  2 , and rising again at the acceptance edges . for the second bin",
    "the picture changes both qualitatively and quantitatively . a dramatic rise at the acceptance edges",
    "is seen , the vertical scale for the ratio had to be increased from 1.2 to 10 .",
    "the lack of experimental and theory constraints result in the nnpdf23qed becoming `` unhinged '' at high invariant masses .",
    "it is used in the diphoton analysis of  @xcite . as noted in  @xcite",
    ", the use of mrst2004qed mem1 appears to produce more realistic results .",
    "the calculations of photon - induced effects in the dilepton channels lead to the same conclusion : mrst2004qed or newer well behaved photon pdfs are recommended for the exploration of the lhc search region at high mass . with the accumulation of lhc luminosity",
    "the pi effects around 750  gev and higher can be measured in the dilepton channels , improving the knowledge of the photon pdf .",
    "before leaving this topic , it is tempting to compare the sophisticated calculations presented above to a simple estimate . assuming that the cross section ratio pi / dy is proportional to the qed and qcd coupling strengths",
    "o(@xmath10 , if only the photon exchange is considered for drell - yan , and taking the renormalization group running of the couplings to 2-loop into account , a rough estimate can be derived . in order to obtain the full ratio , the z exchange and @xmath20z interference terms are added .",
    "the results are compared to the fewz calculations with mrst2004qed in figure  [ fig : fig08 ] . as is evident ,",
    "good agreement with the mrst2004qed predictions is observed , with the kiss estimate well inside the band formed by the two pdf members .",
    "the production of high invariant mass opposite sign lepton pairs in proton - proton collisions at the lhc is an important search region for manifestations of new physics , and for tests of the standard model at highest momentum transfers .",
    "gamma - gamma collisions , where photons radiated by the incoming protons collide , will produce additional lepton pairs - source of background for high mass resonant ( like z ) or non - resonant ( like contact interactions ) searches . in this paper detailed calculations of the drell - yan and photon - induced cross sections in the typical acceptance of a multi - purpose lhc detector at center of mass energy 13  tev",
    "are presented .",
    "the use of mrst2004qed in the constituent mass option or newer well behaved photon pdfs is recommended for the exploration of the lhc search region at high mass .",
    "in addition , a simple estimate of the pi effects is shown to work well from the z peak to the high mass region .",
    "the hint for a diphoton excess , reported by atlas and cms at a mass around 750  gev , makes good theoretical understanding and measurements in the dilepton channels at these energies very desirable in order to explore the hypothesis that such an excess could be produced through gamma - gamma collisions .",
