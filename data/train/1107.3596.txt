    "the introduction of intense lasers has lead to a great variety of applications , including plasma based particle acceleration to relativistic energies @xcite , and with x - ray free - electron lasers @xcite there are new possibilities to explore dense matter on atomic and single molecule levels . on these length scales , of the order of a few ngstrm , quantum effects play an important role in the dynamics of the electrons . using novel laser scattering techniques , quantum dispersive effects",
    "have been observed experimentally both in the degenerate electron gas in metals and in warm dense matters @xcite .",
    "hence , it is expected that quantum mechanical effects must be taken into account in intense laser - solid density plasma interaction experiments @xcite , and in quantum free - electron laser systems @xcite . even though @xmath0-ray lasers have not yet been manufactured ,",
    "there have been suggestions that such lasers could be realized by means of annihilation of bose - einstein condensated positronium @xcite , or by the excitation and nuclear spin relaxation in a lattice of thorium atoms @xcite .",
    "this would lead to a new regime of intense laser - plasma interactions , where the relativistic quantum dynamics plays a decisive role .",
    "intense x - ray and @xmath0-ray sources exist naturally in astrophysical objects in the form of x - ray and @xmath0-ray repeaters , etc . @xcite . in the past ,",
    "the linear plasma response for relativistic ( i.e. relativistically distributed ) quantum plasmas were studied by deriving the longitudinal and transverse response functions for mildly and strongly degenerate electron distributions @xcite .",
    "it was noted @xcite that for super - dense plasmas where @xmath1 , there is a possibility of collisionless pair creation , where @xmath2 is the planck constant divided by @xmath3 , @xmath4 the electron plasma frequency , @xmath5 the electron mass , and @xmath6 the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the results were extended by using a wigner functions approach @xcite , and by considering the longitudinal response @xcite , and more general results for different distribution functions have also been obtained @xcite .",
    "relativistic quantum fluid models have recently been derived @xcite , partially based on earlier works @xcite of fluid - like formulations of the dirac equation . when the intensity of the electromagnetic ( em ) wave reaches a critical level ( e.g. around @xmath7 for one micron wavelength lasers ) , the relativistic electron mass increase and the associated nonlinearity plays a significant role for the propagation and dynamics of the em wave @xcite .",
    "in addition , the relativistic ponderomotive force @xcite produces density modifications in the plasma , and the combined effects of the relativistic electron mass increase and relativistic ponderomotive force can lead to a modulational instability and collapse localization of em waves @xcite .",
    "clearly , for intense em waves interacting with the plasma in the x - ray and @xmath0-ray regimes , both relativistic and quantum effects must be taken into account on an equal footing .    in this paper , we present a nonlinear model , based on the dirac equation coupled with the maxwell equations that are capable of treating both the relativistic ( propagation and mass increase ) , quantum ( tunneling / diffraction ) effects , and electron spin effects .",
    "the mathematical aspects of this system has been studied in the past @xcite .",
    "we will here use the basic model to investigate the nonlinear propagation of large amplitude em waves in a quantum plasma with different spin polarizations .",
    "our work has potential applications in laser - matter experiments @xcite , quantum free - electron laser systems @xcite , as well as in astrophysical environments @xcite .",
    "the quantum mechanical description of the relativistic dynamics of an electron in an em field is given by the dirac equation @xmath8 where we have defined the energy and momentum operators as @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the scalar and vector potentials , and @xmath13 is the magnitude of the electron charge .",
    "the vector @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are unit vectors in the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 directions , have components consisting of the dirac matrices @xmath21 where the pauli spin matrices are @xmath22 and the matrix @xmath23 reads @xmath24 with @xmath25 being unit @xmath26 matrices .",
    "we now wish to use the charge and current densities as sources for the self - consistent em scalar and vector potentials for a quantum plasma .",
    "we therefore let the 4-spinor @xmath27^{t}$ ] represent an ensemble of electrons ( @xmath28 denotes the transpose of the matrix ) . the electric charge and current densities",
    "are obtained as @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively ( where @xmath31 $ ] ) .",
    "the current density incorporates both the particle current and spin current .",
    "the charge and current densities obey the continuity equation @xmath32    the self - consistent vector and scalar potentials are obtained from the em wave equations @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the magnetic vacuum permeability , @xmath36 is the electric permittivity in vacuum , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the neutralizing positive charge density of the ions . for immobile , singly charged ions",
    ", we have @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the equilibrium ion number density . in our model",
    ", we have neglected the fact that degenerate , cold electrons are distributed uniformly in momentum space up to the fermi sphere .",
    "the fermi pressure plays an important role in the dynamics of longitudinal electrostatic waves , where it contributes to the dispersion of the waves . for transverse electromagnetic waves , which will be our main interest here ,",
    "the distribution of electrons play a minor role .",
    "the fermi pressure is unimportant since the transverse electromagnetic waves are not associated with density perturbations .",
    "the effects on the current of particles streaming in one direction is canceled by particles streaming in the opposite direction so that the net effect on the electromagnetic wave is negligible . for extremely dense plasmas , where @xmath41 is comparable to @xmath42 , the speeds of the electrons on the fermi sphere become relativistic and one can expect a frequency downshift due to the relativistic mass increase of these electrons .",
    "this effect , however , is outside the scope of our model .",
    "we here consider the nonlinear propagation of light in dirac matter with different spin polarizations .",
    "solutions have been obtained in the past @xcite for single particles in an em field . here",
    "we formulate the problem in a plasma environment , where we require the quasi - neutrality and current - neutrality along the propagation direction of the em field .",
    "the plasma environment introduces a dimensionless quantum parameter @xmath43 which compares the plasmonic energy @xmath44 to the electron rest mass energy @xmath42 .",
    "typical values are @xmath45 for the electron number density @xmath46 in solid density laser - plasma experiments and @xmath47 may be representative of the modern laser - high density matter experiments @xcite with @xmath48 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath45 , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath47 , where @xmath53 is the electron skin depth . on the other hand , in extremely dense plasmas in the core of white dwarf stares ,",
    "the quantum parameter @xmath54 may be of the order unity . for @xmath55 ,",
    "it has been noticed @xcite that there is a possibility of pair creation , and one then has to take into account positrons on the plasma dynamics .",
    "we do not consider this case here , since it is beyond the scope of our model .      the first step to a self - consistent picture is to solve the dirac equation for a circularly polarized em wave with constant amplitude .",
