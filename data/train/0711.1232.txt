    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are the oldest stellar systems in the universe and thus maintain a fossil record of the early history of galaxies .",
    "they are much brighter than stars and the spatial distribution of the gcs is much more extended than that of the halo stars in galaxies .",
    "therefore they are an excellent tool to investigate the kinematics of the main components ( stellar and dark matter halo , bulge , and disk ) of galaxies and to estimate the mass of their host galaxies .",
    "m31 is a unique object as the nearest spiral galaxy in the local group , providing an excellent place to study gcs .",
    "it has the largest gc system of any galaxy within several mpc .",
    "therefore , there are numerous studies of gcs in m31 since the first study by @xcite ( e.g. , @xcite and see extensive lists of earlier references in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , there were several surveys and studies of the m31 gcs with x - ray detection , finding that the x - ray emitting gcs are commonly associated with low - mass x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "kinematics is one of the notable features for the m31 gcs , and has long been a focus of study .",
    "it is known that the kinematics of the m31 gcs is much different from that of the galactic gcs in the sense that the former is dominated by rotation , while the latter shows weak rotation @xcite the first detailed kinematic analysis of the m31 gc system was given by @xcite using radial velocities for 44 gcs in @xcite .",
    "they estimated the total mass of m31 , m@xmath14 , and found that the metal - poor gcs have a larger velocity dispersion than the metal - rich gcs . @xcite",
    "obtained digital , low - dispersion spectra of 61 gcs , and found that the gc system rotates with an amplitude of @xmath15 km s@xmath1 .",
    "they also found a measurable but small metallicity gradient and no significant spectroscopic difference between the gcs with x - ray detection and those without x - ray detection .",
    "@xcite using the velocity data of 81 gcs obtained a total mass of @xmath16 for a radius of 16 kpc using a projected mass estimator .",
    "a comparison of the data with the model of @xcite showed that the gcs have circular or isotropic orbits , and lead to a total mass of @xmath17 based on circular orbits .",
    "later , @xcite updated the total mass of m31 to be @xmath18 for a radius of 30 kpc using velocity data for 176 gcs .    in the 1990 s ,",
    "metallicity information for a large sample of gcs ( @xmath19 ) became available , and it was possible to investigate the kinematics of gc subsamples based on the metallicity . @xcite",
    "estimated the radial velocities and metallicities for 150 gcs , and presented the detailed kinematics of the gc system using expanded subsamples of gcs based on metallicity .",
    "they identified a weak metallicity gradient as a function of projected radius .",
    "they found that , in the inner region ( @xmath20 kpc ) , the metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath21 ) gcs exhibit a rapid rotation of @xmath22 km s@xmath1 , while the metal - poor gcs show no significant rotation .",
    "however , the rotation of the two subsamples could not be easily measured at larger radii .",
    "later , @xcite showed , using higher precision data of over 200 gcs ( typical velocity measurement error of 12 km s@xmath1 ) , that the entire m31 gc system is highly rotation - supported .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the case of the milky way where the gc system composed mostly of halo gcs is pressure - supported , although a minor system of the bulge gcs shows some rotation .",
    "they also found that the centrally concentrated metal - rich gcs appear not to be flattened , but are analogous to the bulge population with a strong rotation , and that the less concentrated metal - poor gcs also show a rapid rotation .",
    "@xcite obtained velocity data for 42 genuine gcs , and produced a large data set of 349 m31 gcs with up - to - date velocities by combining all information in the literature .",
    "recently , large datasets of velocities for m31 gcs and several deep photometric studies of the halo fields in m31 have provided important clues for understanding the evolution of m31 .",
    "@xcite presented very deep photometry of stars in a halo field along the minor axis of m31 at a projected distance of 11 kpc ( corresponding to a deprojected distance of 53 kpc ) and found that the m31 halo includes a major intermediate - age metal - rich population and a significant old metal - poor population .",
    "they suggested from this result that m31 may have undergone a major merger @xmath23 gyr ago .",
    "later @xcite suggested , from photometry of another minor - axis halo field at a projected distance of 21 kpc , that the outer spheroid is dominated by the debris of earlier merging events that might have occurred more than 8 gyr ago .",
    "@xcite suggested the existence of an old thin disk composed of gcs in m31 , using the data for 321 gcs presented in @xcite .",
    "since the gcs in the thin disk have a metallicity distribution from [ fe / h ] @xmath24 to above solar , and the metal - poor gcs are regarded as being as old as their galactic counterparts , they concluded that the thin disk has remained undisturbed for @xmath25 gyr or more .",
    "this is contradictory with the scenario of @xcite that m31 may have undergone a major merger @xmath23 gyr ago .",
    "later @xcite suggested that the majority of m31 thin disk gcs may be significantly younger than 10 gyr , up to @xmath26 gyr and metal - rich ( @xmath27[fe / h]@xmath28 ) .",
    "the existence of young and metal - rich gcs in the disk is also confirmed in other studies as well @xcite .    on the other hand @xcite first tried to identify subgroups in the m31 gc system using the positional and velocity information for 144 gcs in @xcite .",
    "they suggested that the clustering of gcs in position and velocity space may be a surviving signature of gaseous clumps from which the galaxy halo of m31 formed .",
    "later , @xcite , using 301 gcs with measured velocity and metallicity in @xcite , searched for the subclustering of m31 gcs in the parameter space of projected radius , radial velocity , and metallicity .",
    "interestingly @xcite found a possible tidally distorted satellite of m31 , andromeda viii , from the identification of a group of @xmath29 planetary nebulae ( pne ) , @xmath30 gcs , and two hi clouds .",
    "recent kinematic studies of m31 streams @xcite started examining the gc groups including andromeda viii as a possible progenitor of the stream ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although there were numerous studies to obtain the radial velocities and the metallicities for m31 gcs , there are still many gc candidates for which spectroscopic information is needed .",
    "for example , there are 569 gc candidates for which radial velocities are not available in a combined sample of m31 gcs in @xcite .",
    "recently we have performed a homogeneous photometric and spectroscopic , wide - field survey of gcs in m31 covering a field of @xmath31 3@xmath32 3   centered on m31 .",
    "we presented the first result of our survey : a catalog of new gcs in m31 ( @xcite , paper i ) .",
    "this is the second in the series of papers on this survey .    in this paper , we present the results of a kinematic study of the gc system in m31 using the velocity data of 150 gcs newly obtained in our survey and 354 gcs previously known in the literature .",
    "section 2 gives a brief description of the data used in this analysis , and section 3 investigates the kinematic properties for various subsamples of m31 gcs .",
    "we discuss primary results in  4 .",
    "a summary is given in the final section .",
    "we adopted a distance to m31 of @xmath33 kpc derived by @xcite based on the method of the tip of the red giant branch , which is similar to the value given by @xcite , 770 kpc . at this distance",
    "one arcmin in the sky corresponds to 0.227 kpc .",
    "we adopted the center position of m31 as @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( j2000 ; @xcite ) . following the geometric transformation of @xcite",
    ", we define the @xmath36 and @xmath3 coordinates , which are the projected distances along the major and minor axis , respectively . @xmath36 and",
    "@xmath3 increase towards the northeast and the northwest , respectively , and are given by , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are cartesian coordinates for @xmath40 and @xmath41 with a center at ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) , and pa@xmath44 is the position angle for the major axis @xcite .",
    "first we used the data of gcs in m31 given in paper i , which describes the details of our survey s photometric and spectroscopic observations , data reduction , and the data set . here",
    "we only give a brief summary of the data set of m31 gcs .",
    "we selected gc candidates in washington @xmath45 ccd images covering a @xmath46 field centered on m31 , obtained at the kpno 0.9 m telescope .",
    "spectroscopic observations were made using the hydra multifiber bench spectrograph at the wiyn 3.5 m telescope in september 2000 and november 2001 for 748 gc candidates including 106 previously known gcs .",
    "we determined the radial velocities for gc candidates by cross - correlating the candidate spectrum with those of two bright bonafide gcs in m31 .",
    "finally , we have independently found 1164 gcs and gc candidates , of which 559 are previously known gcs or gc candidates and 605 are newly found gc candidates . among the gcs and gc candidates in our survey , there are 211 genuine gcs ( class 1 in paper i ) with measured velocity .",
    "we have derived new velocity data for 150 gcs in our wide - field survey .",
    "@xcite compiled all known gcs and gc candidates in m31 in the literature , and published the revised bologna catalogue ( rbc ) with 1035 objects .",
    "later , @xcite published an updated version of the revised bologna catalogue v2.0 ( rbc2 ) with 1164 objects . in order to produce a master catalog of radial velocities for m31 genuine gcs , we have secured , from the rbc2",
    ", 349 genuine gcs ( class 1 in rbc2 ) with measured velocities and 5 gc candidates ( i d b366 , g137 , b102 , b430 , b134 in rbc2 ) with measured velocities that were classified as genuine gcs in our survey .",
    "there are 61 objects in common between this study and the rbc2 , if we use a matching tolerance of 4 .",
    "we have compared our velocity measurements with published velocity measurements ( references are in rbc2 ) for these common objects , as displayed in figure [ fig - velcomp ] .",
    "this shows that our measurements , with a typical error of 35.3 km / s , agree with the published values within the combined errors except for nine objects showing velocity differences of over @xmath47 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we present the identification in rbc2 for these gcs in figure [ fig - velcomp ] .",
    "we tried to find any cause of the large difference for the nine objects , finding some explanation for five of them ( b109 , b124 , b293 , b315 , and nb 21 ) , but none for the other four(b347 , b200 , b331 , and b387 ) .",
    "the reasons for large velocity differences for five of these nine objects are as follows :    1 .",
    "* b109 * there are two velocity measurements for this object : @xmath48 km s@xmath1 in @xcite and @xmath49 km s@xmath1 in @xcite . since the velocity difference between two measurements is large and @xcite gives higher precision data , rbc2 quoted @xmath49 km s@xmath1 .",
    "however , the measured velocity in our study is @xmath50 km s@xmath1 , which is consistent with the value in @xcite .",
    "* b124 * there are two velocity measurements for this object : @xmath51 km s@xmath1 in @xcite and @xmath52 km s@xmath1 in @xcite .",
    "since the velocity difference between these two measurements is large and @xcite gives the value with the smaller error , rbc2 quoted @xmath52 km s@xmath1 .",
    "however , the measured velocity in our study is @xmath53 km s@xmath1 , which is consistent with the value in @xcite .",
    "b293 * there are two velocity measurements for this object : @xmath54 km s@xmath1 in @xcite and @xmath55 km s@xmath1 in @xcite .",
    "rbc2 presented the value of a weighted mean ( @xmath56 km s@xmath1 ) , although the velocity difference is about @xmath57 km s@xmath1 .",
    "however , the measured velocity in our study is @xmath58 km s@xmath1 , which is closer to the value of @xcite .",
    "* b315 * there are three velocity measurements for this object : @xmath59 km s@xmath1 in @xcite , @xmath60 km s@xmath1 in @xcite , and @xmath61 km s@xmath1 in @xcite .",
    "rbc2 presented the value of a weighted mean ( @xmath62 km s@xmath1 ) excluding the measurement in @xcite .",
    "however , the measured velocity in our study is @xmath63 km s@xmath1 , which is consistent with the value of @xcite .",
    "nb21 * the velocity measurement in our study is @xmath64 km s@xmath1 , while that in @xcite is @xmath65 km s@xmath1 .",
    "since the pointing coordinate of our spectroscopic observation is different from the photometric center of this object by about 1.72 @xmath66 , and this object is located in field 25 in paper i that is close to the m31 center , the observed spectrum in this study might be significantly contaminated by the m31 stellar light .",
    "since our measurements for b109 , b124 , b293 , and b315 are similar to those of at least one value in the literature , we prefer to keep our measurements for those gcs at this time .",
    "we keep our measurement for nb21 for further analysis , since there is no convincing evidence to change our measurement at this moment . from the weighted linear fit discarding these nine objects with large velocity differences ,",
    "we derive a transformation relation between the two systems ,    @xmath67    the radial velocities for the gcs in rbc2 were transformed onto our velocity system using equation ( [ eq - trans ] ) , and the transformed velocities were used for further analysis .",
    "we used our velocity measurements for the above nine objects .",
    "finally , we produced a master catalog of radial velocities for 504 genuine gcs in m31 .",
    "we derived @xmath68 magnitudes for 483 out of 504 gcs in the master catalog from the ccd images used for our survey as described in @xcite .",
    "figure 2 displays the errors of the measured velocities for the m31 gcs versus @xmath68 magnitude ( a ) and versus @xmath69 , a galactocentric radial distance corrected for the inclination of m31 using the equation @xmath70^{1/2}$ ] where @xmath71 is the inclination angle , @xmath72 ( b ) . in figure 2(a ) , the errors for 136 metal - poor gcs and 63 metal - rich gcs derived in this study are plotted with those for 174 metal - poor gcs and 58 metal - rich gcs derived in the previous studies . in figure 2(b ) , the errors for 46 bright gcs and 99 faint gcs derived in this study are plotted with those for 155 bright gcs and 104 faint gcs derived in the previous studies ( division of the entire sample of m31 gcs into subclasses depending on the metallicity and magnitude will be described in detail in the following section ) .",
    "mean errors for the measured velocities are @xmath73 km  s@xmath1 for all 504 gcs , @xmath74 km  s@xmath1 for 211 gcs measured in this study , and @xmath75 km  s@xmath1 for 293 gcs measured in the previous studies .",
    "mean errors for the measured velocities of the bright and faint gcs are @xmath76 km  s@xmath1 and @xmath77 km  s@xmath1 for 46 bright gcs and 99 faint gcs , respectively , measured in this study , and @xmath78 km  s@xmath1 and @xmath79 km  s@xmath1 for 155 bright gcs and 104 faint gcs , respectively , measured in the previous studies . in the case of the previous measurements , a significant fraction of the measurements for faint gcs",
    "have typical errors of 12 km  s@xmath1 given by @xcite , much smaller than the values in other studies , which leads to a smaller mean value for faint gcs .",
    "excluding the data by @xcite , the mean errors are @xmath80 km  s@xmath1 and @xmath81 km  s@xmath1 for bright gcs and faint gcs , respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows that the mean errors for the measured velocities increase as the gcs get fainter , and that they are larger in the inner region where the background level is higher than that in the outer region of m31 .",
    "the mean values of the radial velocities are derived using the biweight location of @xcite : @xmath82 km  s@xmath1 for 211 gcs measured in this study , and @xmath83 km  s@xmath1 for all 504 gcs in the master catalog .",
    "these values are consistent with those in the previous studies ( @xmath84 km  s@xmath1 in @xcite and @xmath85 km  s@xmath1 in @xcite ) within the uncertainty , and are also compatible with the m31 systemic velocity measured in this study ( @xmath86 km  s@xmath1 ) and that in the literature ( @xmath87 km  s@xmath1 in @xcite ) within the uncertainty .",
    "the larger error in our estimate of the m31 systemic velocity is primarily due to the fact that we used , as templates , the spectra of gcs with small velocity dispersion to estimate the velocity of the nucleus of m31 that has much larger velocity dispersion .",
    "figure [ fig - velhist ] shows the radial velocity histogram for all 504 gcs as well as 211 gcs measured in this study .",
    "it appears that the majority of all gcs are in the range @xmath88 km s@xmath1 @xmath89 km s@xmath1 , and the velocity distribution for all gcs is roughly symmetric with respect to the mean value of the radial velocities .",
    "interestingly , there is one gc with @xmath90 km s@xmath1 measured in this study ( i d 106 in table 5 of paper i ) .",
    "this gc is in the northern disk of m31 ( field 13 in fig . 1 of paper i ) , and has t@xmath91=18.94 , c@xmath92t@xmath91=1.83 , and @xmath93 km s@xmath1 . since the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the spectrum for this gc is only @xmath315 ( measured using h@xmath94 and fe5015 lines ) ,",
    "a higher s / n spectrum is needed to verify its radial velocity and membership clearly .",
    "the velocity dispersion derived using the biweight scale of @xcite is estimated to be @xmath95 km  s@xmath1 for 211 gcs measured in this study , and @xmath96 km  s@xmath1 for all 504 gcs in the master catalog .",
    "both agree well within the errors .    in figure [ fig - img ] , we show the spatial distribution of 504 gcs with measured velocities overlaid on a @xmath97 optical image of m31 from the digitized sky survey .",
    "the spatial distribution of 211 gcs measured in this study is globally similar to that of the 293 gcs measured in the literature .",
    "however , the gcs measured in this study are mainly located in the outer disk of m31 since the spectroscopic observation for the outer disk was done repeatedly ( see paper i for the configuration of the spectroscopic observations ) .",
    "metallicities of 199 gcs in m31 were derived from the line indices measured in the wiyn / hydra spectra by lee et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation , paper iii ) .",
    "we made subsamples based on the metallicities and @xmath68 magnitudes for 504 gcs in the master catalog for further analysis .",
    "we combined the metallicity data of 176 gcs in @xcite and 194 gcs in @xcite with our data of 199 gcs ( paper iii ) in order to include the metallicity data in the master catalog .",
    "there are 32 objects in common between this study and @xcite , and 34 objects in common between this study and @xcite .",
    "we have compared our metallicity measurements with those in these two previous studies for the common objects , as displayed in figure [ fig - fehcomp ] .",
    "it shows that our measurements agree well with the published ones overall , while the scatter in the comparison between this study and @xcite is smaller than that in the comparison between this study and @xcite .",

    "we used our metallicity measurements for the common objects .",
    "finally , we obtained metallicities for 431 gcs in total .",
    "the details of our metallicity data will be given in paper iii .",
    "we present the metallicity distribution of m31 gcs in figure [ fig - subsam](a ) . the kmm test based on the algorithm of @xcite yields the result that the hypothesis that a unimodal distribution fits the data better rather than a bimodal distribution can be rejected at a confidence level of @xmath99 .",
    "the bimodal test results in the following two groups : the metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath100 ) gcs ( @xmath101 ) with a mean value of [ fe / h]@xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) and the metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath104 ) gcs ( @xmath105 ) with a mean value of [ fe / h]@xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "the kmm test with a trimodal distribution also rejects the hypothesis of a unimodal metallicity distribution at a confidence level of @xmath108 . the trimodal test results in the following three groups : the metal - poor gcs ( @xmath109 gcs ) with a mean value of [ fe / h]@xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) , the intermediate metallicity gcs ( @xmath112 gcs ) with a mean value of [ fe / h]@xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) , and the metal - rich gcs ( @xmath115 gcs ) with a mean value of [ fe / h]@xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "although there is no reason to reject the trimodal metallicity distribution for m31 gcs ( to be discussed in detail in paper iii ) , we use the two subsamples of metal - poor and metal - rich gcs from the bimodal distribution to increase the number of gcs per subsample for kinematic analysis in this study .",
    "we derived the mean values of the radial velocities : @xmath118 km s@xmath1 for 310 metal - poor gcs , and @xmath119 km s@xmath1 for 121 metal - rich gcs .",
    "the value for the metal - poor gcs is consistent with that for the entire 504 gc sample ( @xmath120 km  s@xmath1 ) , but the value for the metal - rich gcs is significantly smaller than that for the metal - poor gcs , which was seen earlier in @xcite .    for the velocity dispersion , we found that the dispersion for the metal - poor gcs ( @xmath121 km s@xmath1 ) is significantly larger than that of the metal - rich gcs ( @xmath122 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the result of @xcite that the dispersions for the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs agree within the quoted errors ( @xmath123 km s@xmath1 for the metal - poor gcs and @xmath124 km s@xmath1 for the metal - rich gcs ) .",
    "we find that this difference may be due to the fact that the sample used by @xcite was derived mainly from the disk of m31 , while ours are based on a much wider area , including a larger fraction of probable halo gcs .",
    "the luminosity function for m31 gcs is shown in figure [ fig - subsam ] ( b ) .",
    "we used only 483 gcs for which @xmath68 magnitudes are available in our photometric catalog of m31 survey .",
    "since the survey depth is not uniform across the galaxy due to varying background of stellar light , we use only the gcs brighter than @xmath125 to make subsamples based on @xmath68 magnitudes .",
    "finally , we divide the gcs into 201 bright ( @xmath126 ) and 203 faint ( @xmath127 ) gcs so that the number of gcs in each subsample is similar .",
    "using the master catalog of 504 gcs in m31 , we have investigated the kinematic properties of the m31 gc system for several cases of subsamples : all gcs , metal - poor and metal rich gcs , bright and faint gcs , and x - ray emitting gcs .",

    "we fit the mean radial velocities with a straight line representing a solid - body rotation for the inner region .",
    "we select the appropriate boundary that gives the minimum @xmath136 value by moving the fitting boundary from 10@xmath135 to 50@xmath135 symmetrically .",

    "the uncertainties are defined as the offsets between these values and the values computed using the real data .",
    "we have also derived the rotation - corrected velocity dispersion of the all gc sample , that is , the dispersion about the rotation curve shown in figure 8 : @xmath142 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the velocity histogram for the thin disk @xmath6 kpc ( d ) shows not only two rotation peaks but also a velocity dispersion peak due to the central bulge of m31 .",
    "the rotation amplitudes decrease as the distance along the minor axis of m31 increases .",
    "interestingly , the rotation amplitude is not zero even for the outermost samples at @xmath2 kpc , although the small size of the sample for outer gcs leads to a large uncertainty ( figure [ fig - rotfit ] ( i ) and ( j ) ) .",
    "this result indicates that the halo ( or extended bulge ) of m31 may be not totally pressure - supported but is rotating as well .",
    "this result is consistent with the idea that the m31 halo is dominated by a moderately rotating large bulge rather than by a non - rotating halo far from the plane , which is based on the kinematics of pne in m31 @xcite .",
    "however , this does not necessarily indicate that there is no classical halo in m31 ( see @xcite ) , as discussed in the next section .",
    "on the other hand , the rotation - corrected velocity dispersion of the gcs increases from @xmath143 km s@xmath1 at @xmath6 kpc to @xmath144 km s@xmath1 at @xmath2 kpc .",
    "thus the velocity dispersion becomes about twice as large as the nominal rotation amplitude at @xmath2 kpc , showing that pressure support is much larger than rotation support in the outer halo .",
    "although the gc system in m31 is dominated by disk rotation , there are also seen some gcs that do not follow the disk rotation . to identify the gcs that do not follow the disk rotation",
    ", we select ` friendless ' gcs adopting the method used for the study of the kinematics of m31 pne in @xcite .    in summary , we select the friendless gcs that deviate from the mean velocity of neighbor gcs on the sky more than @xmath145 , where @xmath141 is the velocity dispersion of neighbor gcs . the number of gcs that defines the local environment is taken to be @xmath146^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath147 is used in this study . among all 504 gcs , we find 50 friendless gcs . the spatial distribution of the friendless gcs is shown in figure [ fig - spatnofof ] .",
    "it is seen that they are located mostly in the disk .",
    "however , most of them are located in the quadrants of retro - grade rotation ( the first and third ) in the @xmath148 versus @xmath36 diagram .",
    "the friendless gcs in the second and fourth quadrants have mostly velocities larger than the largest velocities of the gcs following the major disk rotation .",
    "these friendless gcs may have different origin from the main population of gcs following disk rotation .    to highlight the kinematics of the friendless gcs , we plot , in figure [ fig - spatvelnofof ] , the spatial distribution of only the friendless gcs with the symbol size scaled according to their velocity deviations from the systemic velocity of m31 .",
    "interestingly , it appears that the friendless gcs rotate around the major axis of m31 unlike the rotation around the minor axis for the disk population .",
    "@xcite suggested that the friendless pne in their sample may link to the southern stream and the northern spur since the positions and velocities of the friendless pne are consistent with the two streams .",
    "recently , other stellar substructures in m31 were found by several authors @xcite . since the kinematic information on stellar substructures in m31 is available , it would be interesting to compare the kinematics of the friendless gcs with those of stellar substructures , which may provide a clue to understand the motion and origin of the friendless gcs , but it is beyond the scope of this paper .    in figure [ fig - photnofof ]",
    ", we show the photometric properties of @xmath68 magnitudes and ( @xmath149 ) colors , and spectroscopic metallicities for the friendless gcs .",
    "the friendless gcs have a mean @xmath68 magnitude of @xmath150 mag with a deviation of @xmath151 mag , which is similar to the values of @xmath152 mag with a deviation of @xmath153 mag for the normal gcs . the mean metallicities are also similar between the friendless and normal gcs , but the mean ( @xmath149 ) color for the friendless gcs ( @xmath154 mag with @xmath155 ) is slightly redder than that for the normal gcs ( @xmath156 mag with @xmath157 ) .",
    "we used a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test to determine whether the friendless and normal gc populations were drawn from the same distribution .",
    "the hypothesis that the two distributions are extracted from the same parent population can be rejected at the confidence level of @xmath158 for the @xmath68 magnitude distribution , @xmath159 for ( @xmath149 ) color distribution , and @xmath160 for the metallicity distribution .",
    "therefore , only @xmath68 magnitudes and ( @xmath149 ) colors appear to be slightly different .",
    "however , this problem needs to be investigated further using the reddening - corrected magnitudes and colors .",
    "figure [ fig - spathistfeh ] shows the spatial and radial distributions of the 310 metal - poor and 121 metal - rich gcs .",
    "the most striking difference in the radial distribution between the two subpopulations is that the metal - rich gcs show a much stronger central concentration than the metal - poor gcs , which is consistent with the results based on the smaller data set in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular the radial distribution of the metal - rich gcs show a very narrow peak with a half width of about 10 arcmin , showing that they belong to the central bulge of m31 .",
    "median values of the absolute distances along the major axis for the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs are @xmath161 and @xmath162 , respectively , and those along the minor axis for the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs are @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively .",
    "in addition , a small number of metal - rich gcs are found in the outer region , even at about @xmath165 from the major axis .",
    "there are 9 gcs within the boundary of the standard diameter in ngc 205 .",
    "all of these gcs are metal - poor , as found by earlier studies @xcite .    to highlight the difference in spatial distribution between the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs , we plot , in figure [ fig - spatconfeh ] , the number density contours for the metallicity subsamples .",
    "several features are noted in figure [ fig - spatconfeh ] .",
    "first , the spatial distribution of the metal - rich gcs shows a much stronger central concentration than that of the metal - poor gcs , as seen before .",
    "second , the spatial distribution of the metal - rich gcs shows almost circular structure in the central region of m31 , while that of the metal - poor gcs shows an extended structure elongated along the major axis with a similar ellipticity to that of the m31 disk .",
    "this difference is less clearly seen in the sample of bright gcs ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "third , there are several substructures in both subpopulations .",
    "the most notable metal - poor substructures are one in the region @xmath167 and @xmath168 , and one in the region @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "these two correspond to the gc groups ids 10 and 11 , respectively , in @xcite .",
    "these are close to , but not consistent with , the position of and viii .",
    "one metal - rich gc and four metal - poor gcs are found within the standard diameter of and viii .",
    "the substructure of metal - poor gcs in ngc 205 corresponds to the gc group i d 5 in @xcite .",
    "two notable substructures among the metal - rich gcs are on the major axis : one at @xmath171 and the other at @xmath172 .",
    "these correspond , respectively , to the gc group i d 8 and the sum of ids 2 and 3 , respectively , in @xcite .",
    "one substructure containing both metal - poor gcs and metal - rich gcs at @xmath173 and @xmath174 ( seen only in the bright gcs ) corresponds to the gc group i d 7 in @xcite .",
    "therefore most of the gc groups in @xcite are confirmed in this study . in figure",
    "[ fig - spatvelfeh ] , we present the radial velocities for the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs versus the projected radii along the major axis ( x ) and the minor axis ( y ) . a linear least - squares",
    "fit , passing through @xmath131 , along the major axis results in @xmath175 km s@xmath1 for the metal - poor gcs and @xmath176 km s@xmath1 for the metal - rich gcs .",
    "a least - squares fit along the minor axis results in @xmath177 km s@xmath1 for the metal - poor gcs and @xmath178 km s@xmath1 for the metal - rich gcs .",
    "as known previously , both the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs show a strong and very similar rotation around the minor axis and no or a weak rotation around the major axis .",
    "the kinematic difference between the two subsamples is not significant at this stage .    to investigate any kinematic difference between the two subsamples in detail , we plot , in figure [ fig - rotfitfeh ] , the radial velocities for the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs as a function of the projected distance along the major axis of m31 and the velocity histograms .",
    "we also plot the mean radial velocities of the gcs in a distance bin of @xmath179 along the major axis .",
    "we estimate the rotation amplitudes for the two subsamples using the same fitting procedure applied in figure [ fig - rotfit ] . the rotation amplitude estimated by fitting",
    "the rotation curves ( left panels ) shows that the rotation of the metal - rich gcs ( @xmath180 km s@xmath1 ) is indistinguishable from that of the metal - poor gcs ( @xmath181 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "however , @xcite found that the rotation of the metal - rich gcs ( @xmath182 km s@xmath1 ) is slightly stronger than that of the metal - poor gcs ( @xmath183 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the rotation curve in the metal - poor gcs is asymmetric at @xmath184 arcmin .",
    "the metal - poor gcs at @xmath185 arcmin follow a solid - body rotation , while those at @xmath184 arcmin do not .",
    "since the distribution of the metal - poor gcs is more extended than the metal - rich gcs , the asymmetric rotation curve is seen only for the metal - poor gcs .",
    "contours in figure [ fig - rotfitfeh ] show clearly this asymmetry at @xmath186 where the mean radial velocities are larger than the opposite end ( at @xmath187 ) .",
    "note also that there is a significant substructure at @xmath171 with @xmath188 km s@xmath1 , found in a wide - field survey .",
    "this corresponds to the most notable metal - poor substructure described above .",
    "therefore these substructures are distinguishable not only in spatial distribution but also in kinematics .",
    "this substructure may be related with the southern stream emanating from the southwest disk of m31 found in a wide field survey of red giants by @xcite .",
    "in addition , we derived the rotation amplitude from the velocity histogram of the metal - poor gcs ( panel ( b ) ) .",
    "the rotation amplitude of the metal - poor gcs is estimated to be @xmath189 km s@xmath1 , which is slightly smaller than , but agrees within the error to , the value derived from the @xmath148 vs @xmath36 diagram above .",
    "the velocity histogram of the metal - rich gcs shows a single strong peak , showing that the sample is dominated by the gcs in the central bulge .",
    "so we did not try to derive a rotation velocity for the metal - rich gcs from the velocity histogram .",
    "we have derived the rotation - corrected velocity dispersions : @xmath190 km s@xmath1 for the metal - poor gcs , and @xmath191 km s@xmath1 for the metal - rich gcs .",
    "thus the rotation - corrected velocity dispersion for the metal - poor gcs is very similar to that for the metal - rich gcs .    in figures [ fig - rotfitmp ] and [ fig - rotfitmr ]",
    ", we also present the radial velocities of the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs as a function of the projected distance along the major axis of m31 and the velocity histogram of the gcs for the samples of different distance bins along the minor axis in order to investigate the rotational variation along the minor axis .",
    "the metal - poor gcs show that the rotation velocity is roughly decreasing with increasing distance from the major axis , but the uncertainties are too large to derive a reliable rotational velocity for the outer region at @xmath192 kpc .",
    "the metal - rich gcs show a similar trend to that of the metal - poor gcs at @xmath193 kpc , but they suffer more from the small number statistics problem .",
    "the rotation - corrected velocity dispersion of the metal - poor gcs increases from @xmath194 km s@xmath1 at @xmath6 kpc to @xmath195 km s@xmath1 at @xmath2 kpc .",
    "thus the velocity dispersion becomes about twice as large as the rotation amplitude at @xmath2 kpc , showing that pressure support is much larger than rotation support in the outer halo of m31 .      in figure",
    "[ fig - spathistmag ] , we show the spatial distribution of the bright and faint gcs .",
    "it is seen that the bright gcs are more centrally concentrated than the faint gcs .",
    "median values of the absolute distances along the major axis for the 201 bright and 203 faint gcs are @xmath196 and @xmath197 , respectively , and those along the minor axis for the bright and faint gcs are @xmath198 and @xmath199 , respectively .",
    "thus , the difference between the two subsamples in the spatial distribution along the major axis is significant , while that along the minor axis is not .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that a significant fraction of bright gcs are located in the central bulge of m31 and that a large number of faint gcs in the central region of m31 were not detected in the current surveys .",
    "we present the radial velocities of the bright and faint gcs versus the projected radii along the major axis ( x ) and along the minor axis ( y ) in figure [ fig - spatvelmag ] .",
    "the linear least - squares fits , passing through @xmath131 , along the major axis result in @xmath200 km s@xmath1 for the bright gcs and @xmath201 km s@xmath1 for the faint gcs .",

    "both the bright and faint gcs show a strong rotation around the minor axis and no or weak rotation around the major axis .",
    "the kinematic difference between the two subsamples is not significant .",
    "we also plot the radial velocities for the bright and faint gcs as a function of the projected distance along the major axis of m31 and the velocity histograms in figure [ fig - rotfitmag ] .",
    "we estimate the rotation amplitudes for the two subsamples using the same fitting procedure applied in figure [ fig - rotfit ] .",
    "the rotation amplitudes estimated by fitting the rotation curves ( left panels ) show that the rotation of the faint gcs ( @xmath204 km s@xmath1 ) is stronger than that of the bright gcs ( @xmath205 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "in addition , the rotation amplitude from the velocity histogram shows again that the rotation of the faint gcs ( @xmath206 km s@xmath1 ) is stronger than that of the bright gcs ( @xmath207 km s@xmath1 ) . the difference in rotation amplitudes between the bright and faint gcs",
    "is closely related to the difference in their spatial distributions .",
    "since the faint gcs are more extended along the major axis than the bright gcs , the rotation amplitude of the faint gcs is estimated to be larger than that of the bright gcs .",
    "it is noted that the rotation - corrected velocity dispersion for the bright gcs , @xmath208 km s@xmath1 is much larger than that for the faint gcs , @xmath209 km s@xmath1 .      to investigate the kinematic properties of x - ray emitting gcs in m31 , we cross - correlated the gcs and gc candidates from the optical survey with the x - ray sources in m31 .",
    "we used as the optical source list , the catalog of 1778 gc candidates prepared combining our survey , rbc2 , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we made a master catalog of x - ray sources in m31 by combining 560 sources in the _ rosat _ survey @xcite , 204 sources in the _ chandra _ survey @xcite , 856 sources in the _ xmm - newton _ survey @xcite , and 62 x - ray emitting gcs in @xcite .",
    "if a gc candidate in the optical survey lies within a circle of @xmath210 positional uncertainty of an x - ray source , we regard it as a match .",
    "we used @xmath211 positional uncertainty for the _ rosat _ sources due to its large positional uncertainty ( 5@xmath9248 arcsec of @xmath211 with a median value of 7 arcsec ) .",
    "in addition , we matched optical gc candidates with 62 x - ray emitting gcs in @xcite using the identification of gcs , since @xcite presented only a catalog of x - ray emitting gcs .",
    "finally , we identify 56 gcs and gc candidates ( classes 1 and 2 in paper i and rbc2 ) with x - ray detections ( 40 genuine gcs including 39 gcs with measured velocities , and 16 gc candidates ) .",
    "there are 13 gcs that were identified as x - ray emitting gcs in @xcite , but were not included in our combined optical gc catalog .",
    "therefore , we increase the number of x - ray emitting gcs in m31 by 69 , including 13 gcs that were not presented in our gc catalog . for further kinematic analysis ,",
    "we use only the homogeneous data set of 56 x - ray emitting gcs and gc candidates presented in our optical gc catalog .",
    "we show , in figure [ fig - spatxgc ] , the spatial distribution of 39 genuine gcs with x - ray detection and measured velocity in company with 1 gc and 16 gc candidates with x - ray detection but no measured velocity .",
    "it is difficult to make strong conclusions about the spatial distribution of the x - ray emitting gcs since the x - ray surveys did not uniformly cover the whole region in m31 .",
    "however , it is clearly seen that a large number of the x - ray emitting gcs are located in the central bulge region of m31 and that they show a large velocity dispersion .",
    "in addition , it appears that the majority of x - ray emitting gcs follow the disk rotation of m31 .    in figure [ fig - photxgc ]",
    ", we show the photometric properties of the x - ray emitting gcs compared with that of all 504 gcs .",
    "we used the ks test to determine whether the x - ray emitting and the entire gc population were drawn from the same distribution .",
    "interestingly , the hypothesis that the two distributions are extracted from the same parent population can be rejected at the confidence level of @xmath212 for the distribution of @xmath68 magnitude , ( @xmath149 ) color , and the metallicity .",
    "this result based on the analysis of the expanded sample of m31 x - ray emitting gcs confirms the previous results @xcite .",
    "the properties of x - ray emitting gcs in m31 are consistent with those of gcs in early - type galaxies : redder , more metal - rich , and brighter gcs are more likely to be detected as x - ray emitting gcs @xcite .",
    "rotation curves are useful for inferring the amount and distribution of underlying dark matter in galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for m31 , there are several studies to derive the rotation curve using various tracers : hii regions @xcite , hi @xcite , co @xcite , pne @xcite , and gcs @xcite .",
    "to obtain the rotation curve of m31 using the sample of 504 gcs in this study , we first selected 454 gcs following the m31 disk rotation by rejecting 50 friendless gcs defined in ",
    "[ egcnofof ] .",

    "we plot the rotation velocity corrected for inclination , @xmath215 , where @xmath36 is the projected distance along the major axis of m31 and @xmath69 is the deprojected radius in the plane of the disk , @xmath216^{1/2}$ ] . for each gc",
    ", we use the nearest 21 gcs to estimate the mean velocity , taken as the rotation velocity at that radius , and to estimate the velocity dispersion .",
    "we stop the calculation when the number of the nearest gcs is less than 21 ( @xmath217 and @xmath218 ) .",
    "typical 1@xmath141 uncertainties using the bootstrap procedure for the rotation velocity and for the dispersion are 12 km s@xmath1 and 8 km s@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "for comparison , we derive also the rotation curve of pne using the velocity data in @xcite by applying the same procedure as above . for pne , typical 1@xmath141 uncertainties for the rotation velocity and for the dispersion",
    "are both 4 km s@xmath1 .",
    "it appears that the rotation curve of the gcs in this study agrees well with those of other tracers in the range @xmath219 .",
    "however , the rotation curve of pne derived using the velocity data of @xcite is different from the other profiles in the similar radial range .",
    "the rotation velocity for pne at @xmath220 is on average about 50 km  s@xmath1  smaller compared with those of other tracers , as seen in figure 33 of @xcite .",
    "they showed that the presence of significant random velocities at all radii account for the asymmetric drift between the rotational motion and the local circular speed for pne . in the inner region ( @xmath221 ) of m31 , the rotation curves are significantly different from each other .",
    "a careful study is needed for the rotation curves in the inner region due to the contribution of the non - circular motion of the bulge and the projection effect of an inclined m31 disk .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles for the gcs and the pne are similar in general except for the inner region at @xmath222 .",
    "the velocity dispersion decreases from @xmath223 km  s@xmath1at @xmath224 to @xmath225 km  s@xmath1at @xmath226 , and changes little in the outermost area .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the gcs seems to increase again at @xmath227 , while that of the pne keeps slowly decreasing with @xmath69 .",
    "more data on the gcs further out in the halo are needed to confirm this difference , which can probe whether a pressure - supported hot halo exists or not in m31 .",
    "we have estimated the mass of m31 from the kinematic information of the gcs in this study using two methods : ` projected mass estimator ( pme ) ' and ` tracer mass estimator ( tme ) ' .",
    "pme was introduced by @xcite for the case of test particles orbiting a point mass , and later was extended by @xcite for those tracing the total mass .",
    "the mass based on pme is given by    @xmath228    where @xmath229 is the number of objects , @xmath230 is the gravitational constant , @xmath231 is the projected galactocentric radius , and @xmath232 is the line - of - sight velocity relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy .",
    "the constant @xmath233 is used for the objects with an isotropic orbit , while @xmath234 for the objects with a radial orbit .",
    "we obtain @xmath235 using all 504 gcs out to a radius of @xmath236 kpc with an assumption of isotropic orbits .",
    "later @xcite introduced a new method of tme for the case that the tracer population such as gcs and pne does not follow the underlying mass distribution dominated by dark matter .",
    "they applied the tme to 321 gcs of @xcite , and obtained , for @xmath237 kpc , @xmath238 that is composed of a rotation contribution , @xmath239 and of a pressure contribution , @xmath240 .",
    "similarly , @xcite obtained a larger mass of @xmath241 using the tme with the expanded sample of 349 gcs . in this study , we first select 301 metal - poor gcs considered to be halo gcs , and choose a radial range where the surface number density of the halo gcs falls off as a power law .",
    "the surface number density of our metal - poor gcs follows approximately a power law @xmath242 beyond @xmath243 , similar to that of @xcite .",
    "finally , 146 halo gcs in the range of projected radius , @xmath244 ( @xmath245 kpc ) are selected .",
    "we set @xmath246 ( isothermal - like galaxy ) , @xmath247 , @xmath248 kpc , and @xmath249 kpc using the same assumptions as in @xcite .",
    "then , we obtain for @xmath250 kpc , the total mass of m31 , @xmath251 that is composed of a rotation contribution , @xmath252 , and of a pressure contribution , @xmath253 .    to compare our estimation with the results in the literature , we plot the various dynamical mass estimates using gcs @xcite , satellite galaxies @xcite , and streams @xcite of m31 in figure [ fig - mass ] . in addition , several profiles of the mass model for m31 are plotted @xcite .",
    "the mass estimate based on pme derived in this study agrees well with other observational estimates by @xcite and two mass models by @xcite .",
    "however , the mass estimates based on tme derived in this study and in @xcite are larger than other estimates , and they are also larger than any models . if the tme is correct , the mass model of m31 needs a revision to a larger mass .",
    "this is also consistent with the @xcite s suggestion based on the study of a new dwarf galaxy , andxiv .",
    "noting that andxiv shows a large velocity of @xmath254 km s@xmath1 relative to m31 at a projected galactocentric distance of 162 kpc , @xcite suggested that recent mass models of m31 need a revision to larger , if andxiv is bound to m31 .",
    "similar discussion on the increase of the milky way galaxy s mass based on the most distant satellite ( @xmath255 kpc ) , the leo i dwarf spheroidal galaxy , was given in @xcite .",
    "the existence of a halo in m31 has been controversial .",
    "while @xcite suggested that the metal - poor gcs in m31 show little evidence of rotation , indicating that they belong to the halo of m31 , other studies based on surface photometry , counts of red giant branch stars , and counts of pne along the minor axis of m31 found an extended bulge , but no evidence of any halo component in m31 @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies covering a very wide field of m31 are finding evidence for a huge halo in m31 @xcite as well as a vast extended disk reaching about 40 kpc from the center of m31 @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a minor - axis surface brightness profile reaching out to a projected radius of @xmath256 ( @xmath257 kpc ) , combining surface photometry and faint red giant star counts .",
    "they found that the minor - axis profile can be fit by a de vaucouleurs law with effective bulge radius @xmath258 ( 1.4 kpc ) out to a projected radius of @xmath259 ( @xmath260 kpc ) , and that there is a separate component beyond @xmath259 that can be fit by either a power law of index about 2.3 or an exponential law of scale length 14 kpc .",
    "one thing interesting about this component is that it has the same color as the inner region , indicating that it has a similar metallicity to that of the bulge ( assuming the two components have the same age ) .",
    "in addition , the photometry of remote fields along the minor axis of m31 showed that most stars in these fields have unexpectedly high metallicity , [ m / h]@xmath261 ( [ fe / h]@xmath262 ) while there are some metal - poor stars as well @xcite .",
    "thus there are two components in the outer region of m31 that are distinguished in structure , but not in metallicity .",
    "we may say from the results based on stars that m31 has a huge dominant bulge reaching out to @xmath256 , or that m31 has two bulges : an inner bulge ( out to @xmath259 ) and an outer bulge ( out to @xmath256 ) .",
    "even the inner bulge is much larger than the central bulge in our galaxy , and the outer bulge may be called a halo .",
    "the progenitors of pne are low to intermediate mass stars so that they are often considered as a good tracer for old stellar populations .",
    "for example , the radial number density profiles of pne in m31 show excellent agreement with the @xmath69-band surface brightness profiles of the stellar bulge and disk @xcite .",
    "in particular , the number density profile of pne along the minor axis of m31 is consistent with the @xmath263 profile out to one degree @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that there is little excess of pne over the @xmath263 profile even at @xmath3110 @xmath264 ( one degree ) , indicating no separate halo component .",
    "this is also consistent with the result based on the surface brightness profile along the minor axis @xcite .",
    "considering the rotating kinematics of the outer pne at @xmath265 kpc in m31 as well as the above points , @xcite suggested that the bulge is the most dominating component in m31 , while a nonrotating , pressure - supported halo is , if any , only a very minor component of m31 .    in general , or at least in our galaxy ,",
    "metal - poor gcs are considered as a tracer of the halo , while metal - rich gcs belong to the bulge or thick disk like the pne , although the bulge does have some metal - poor gcs @xcite .",
    "note that the kinematics of 17 old star clusters in m33 , irrespective of their metallicity , show evidence for the existence of a hot halo in m33 @xcite .",
    "therefore we may use metal - poor gcs to investigate the properties of any halo in m31 .",
    "the kinematics of the metal - poor gcs along the major axis at @xmath266 kpc show a rotation as strong as the metal - rich gcs .",
    "the rotation amplitude of the metal - poor gcs decreases with increasing distance from the major axis , and the metal - poor gcs show some rotation ( @xmath267 km  s@xmath1 ) even far from the major axis at @xmath268 kpc .",
    "these results are consistent with those of @xcite , but not with @xcite .    however , the rotation - corrected velocity dispersion for the metal - poor gcs is about twice as large as the rotation amplitude in the outer region at @xmath268 kpc .",
    "the rotation - corrected velocity dispersion for the metal - poor gcs at @xmath268 kpc in m31 , @xmath195 km s@xmath1 , is comparable to that of the metal - poor gcs in the galactic halo at @xmath269 kpc , @xmath270 km",
    "s@xmath1 given by @xcite . considering that the spatial distribution of the metal - poor gcs in m31 is much more extended than that of the metal - rich gcs and that the velocity dispersion of the metal - poor gcs in the outer region of m31 is about two times larger than the rotation amplitude , we conclude that there is a dynamically hot halo in m31 that is rotating but primarily pressure - supported .",
    "this is consistent with the discovery of a pressure - supported metal - poor stellar halo based on the observations of red giant branch stars at radii from 10 kpc to 165 kpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite found from the analysis of a large sample of red giant branch stars : ( a ) there is seen a stellar halo component with low metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath271 ) at radii from 10 to 70 kpc , ( b ) there is little radial gradient of metallicity , ( c ) there is no significant evidence for rotation , and ( d ) the velocity dispersion of this metal - poor halo can be represented by @xmath272 km s@xmath1 where @xmath231 is a projected galactocentric distance in units of kpc .",
    "in figure 25 we display the radial variation of the mean metallicity for the metal - poor gcs in comparison with that for the red giant branch stars given by @xcite .",
    "a few features are noted in figure 25 : ( a ) the mean metallicity for the metal - poor gcs is much lower than that for the red giant branch stars at the same distance from the m31 center ; ( b ) the mean metallicity for the metal - poor gcs in the inner region is similar to that for the red giant branch stars much further out at @xmath273 kpc that was considered to be the part of the stellar halo by @xcite ; and ( c ) the mean metallicity of the metal - poor gcs shows little radial dependence : [ fe / h]@xmath274 at @xmath275 kpc to [ fe / h]@xmath276 at @xmath277 kpc ( if we use all gcs , we obtain [ fe / h]@xmath278 at @xmath279 kpc to [ fe / h]@xmath276 at @xmath277 kpc ) .",
    "these show that the metal - poor gcs are tracing the metal - poor halo , even in the inner region of m31 .",
    "recently @xcite found a faint , smooth and extremely extended halo component , reaching out to 150 kpc , about three times larger than the limit studied by @xcite .",
    "in addition , they found , from the photometry of red giant branch stars , that the majority of the stars in this extended halo are metal - poor , in contrast to the @xcite finding that its integrated color is similar to the inner bulge . in spite of its huge size ,",
    "the total luminosity of this halo derived assuming that it is symmetric is found to be @xmath280 l@xmath281 , similar to the stellar halo of our galaxy",
    ". therefore it will be interesting to find gcs and investigate their kinematics in this outer halo of m31 .",
    "pne are an excellent tool for studying the kinematics of the bulge and halo of a galaxy .",
    "recently huge data sets for the pne in m31 were published by @xcite . how do the kinematics of the gcs compare with that of the pne in m31 ? we have derived the kinematics of about 2500 pne using the same method to the data given by @xcite , as used for the analysis of the gc data , which are summarized in table 2 .",
    "figure 26 displays radial velocities ( dots ) versus the projected distances along the major axis ( @xmath36 ) and the velocity histogram for the pne in m31 based on the data given by @xcite , like figure 8 for gcs .",
    "we plot also the mean radial velocity and its dispersion of the pne in a distance bin of 10 @xmath135 along the major axis .",
    "velocity histograms of pne are displayed with gaussian fits as in figure 8 .",
    "figure 26 shows that the rotational properties of the pne are very similar to those of the gcs .",
    "the rotational amplitudes of all pne are @xmath282 km s@xmath1 from the rotation curve , and @xmath283 km s@xmath1 from the velocity histogram , which are similar to those of gcs derived in this study , @xmath139 km s@xmath1 , and @xmath140 km s@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the rotation amplitudes of the pne decrease as the distance along the minor axis of m31 increases , but the rotation amplitude is not zero even for the outermost samples at @xmath2 kpc , which are consistent with the results based on gcs derived in this study .    the rotation - corrected velocity dispersion for all pne is estimated to be @xmath284 km s@xmath1 , which is much smaller than that for all gcs , @xmath285 km s@xmath1 . the rotation - corrected velocity dispersion for the pne at @xmath266 kpc is @xmath286 km s@xmath1 , and it becomes smaller and shows little variation with @xmath287 : @xmath288 km s@xmath1 for @xmath289 kpc , @xmath290 km s@xmath1 for @xmath291 kpc , and @xmath292 km s@xmath1 for @xmath293 kpc .",
    "thus the rotation - corrected velocity dispersion for the pne at @xmath266 kpc is consistent with that for the metal - rich gcs at @xmath266 kpc ,",
    "@xmath294 km s@xmath1",
    ". we can not compare the kinematics of the pne at @xmath295 kpc with that of the metal - rich gcs at @xmath295 , because there are too few such gcs in this region .",
    "the rotation - corrected velocity dispersions for the pne at @xmath295 kpc are significantly different from those for the metal - poor gcs .",
    "that is , the rotation - corrected velocity dispersion for the pne at @xmath295 kpc are smaller than that for the metal - poor gcs at @xmath295 kpc , and the former shows little variation depending on @xmath287 for @xmath295 kpc , while the latter increases with @xmath287 .",
    "these differences show that the pne are tracing well the bulge , while the metal - poor gcs are tracing better the metal - poor halo , although their spatial coverages in the sky are similar .",
    "therefore we conclude again that there do exist both an extended rotating bulge and a dynamically hot metal - poor halo in m31 .",
    "main features related with the kinematics of the m31 gc system revealed in this study can be summarized as follows .",
    "most of the gcs show a strong rotation around the minor axis .",
    "the rotation velocity decreases with increasing distance from the major axis .",
    "it is still as large as @xmath267 km  s@xmath1  even at @xmath268 kpc , indicating the bulge of m31 is large and rotation - dominated , which is consistent with the finding based on the pne by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the rotation velocity of the metal - rich gcs is similar to that of the metal - poor gcs in the region close to the major disk .",
    "the spatial distribution of metal - rich gcs shows a stronger central concentration than that of the metal - poor gcs .",
    "the rotation - corrected velocity dispersion of the metal - poor gcs in the outer region of m31 is about twice larger than the rotation amplitude .",
    "there are several substructures in the spatial distribution of both metal - poor gcs and metal - rich gcs .",
    "there are about 50 friendless gcs all over the disk of m31 , and most of them show retrograde motion .",
    "interestingly it appears that these gcs show a rotation around the major axis , while most of m31 gcs show a rotation around the minor axis .",
    "what do these results in addition to the known properties of m31 tell us about the formation and evolution of m31 in comparison with our galaxy ?",
    "the most distinguishable kinematic difference between the m31 gcs and the galactic gcs is a difference in the bulge and halo kinematics . in our galaxy metal - poor halo gcs",
    "are the most dominant population among the gcs , and metal - rich gcs in the bulge ( or thick disk ) are a minor population .",
    "the bulge gcs show significant rotation ( @xmath296 km  s@xmath1 ) , while the halo gcs are pressure - supported ( @xmath297 km  s@xmath1and @xmath298 km s@xmath1 ) @xcite . in contrast , the disk and bulge gcs are the most dominant population in m31 , and the halo gcs may be a minor population compared with the galactic halo gcs .",
    "the current picture of the formation and evolution of the halo in our galaxy involves basically two classical scenarios : ( a ) the monolithic collapse model according to which the stellar halo is formed by the rapid collapse of a monolithic protogalactic cloud in a dynamical time scale of about 0.1 gyr @xcite , and ( b ) the accretion / merging model according to which the stellar halo is formed via successive accretion and merging of protogalactic fragments @xcite .",
    "the latter is related with the current paradigm for explaining the formation of the cosmological large scale structure : a hierarchical merging scenario in the @xmath299cdm universe .",
    "it appears that both scenarios are involved in forming the halo of our galaxy @xcite . while the inner part of our galaxy can be explained mainly by the first ,",
    "the outer part of our galaxy is explained better by the latter .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested from a semi - analytic multizone chemical evolution model that the observed higher metallicity in the m31 halo compared with the galactic halo can be explained by two scenarios : ( a ) a higher star formation efficiency for the halo that is expected from the accretion of smaller satellites , or ( b ) a larger reservoir of infalling halo gas with a longer halo phase , producing the intermediate - age population in the halo .",
    "these were also confirmed in the semi - cosmological spiral galaxy simulation by @xcite , indicating that the m31 halo may have a more protracted assembly history compared with the halo of our galaxy .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite found from the simulation of the stellar halo in our galaxy based on the hierarchical scenario : ( a ) the stellar halo of our galaxy formed inside out via accretion of satellites ; ( b ) the inner halo at @xmath300 kpc assembled rapidly , and most of its mass were in place more than 8 - 9 gyr ago ; ( c ) satellites surviving today were accreted within the past few gyr ; and ( d ) a major fraction of the present - day stellar halo was originally from a few massive satellites with @xmath301 @xmath302 .",
    "they also pointed out that the much lower metallicity of the galactic halo compared with the m31 halo indicates that our galaxy could have formed mainly through smaller satellites . noting that our galaxy has a stellar mass and angular momentum that are 2 to 3 times lower than m31 , which is a typical spiral galaxy , @xcite suggested that our galaxy has an exceptionally quiet formation history involving no major merger during the last 10 - 11 gyr .",
    "however , it is noted that the term m31 halo used in these studies corresponds to the extended bulge , not to the metal - poor halo in m31 .",
    "therefore these studies explain the formation of the extended bulge in m31 and the halo in our galaxy .",
    "m31 might have formed and evolved in a way similar to our galaxy , with some differences . the existence of the rotating metal - rich central bulge , the radial gradient of the metallicity and the extended smooth metal - poor halo in m31 can be explained by a rapid dissipative collapse of a proto - galactic cloud , while the extended bulge and its several substructures including giant streams and friendless gcs ( @xcite and this study ) , are evidence for accretion and merging of small scale fragments . differences between m31 and our galaxy are that the degree of merging was larger , the scale of merging fragments was larger , and the duration of merging ( or the frequency of merging ) was larger in m31 compared with our galaxy .",
    "remaining questions are : ( a ) why does m31 have an extended metal - rich bulge in m31 , which is not seen in our galaxy ? ; ( b ) why is the m31 extended bulge a strong rotator ? ; ( c ) are there metal - poor gcs that do not show systematic rotation in the halo of m31 ? ; ( d ) why do the metal - poor gcs in m31 show some rotation while those in our galaxy do not ? ; and ( e ) is there indeed a population of young disk gcs in m31 as posited by @xcite , which has no counterpart in the galaxy ?",
    "we produced a master catalog of 504 gcs with measured velocity in m31 combining the data for 211 gcs measured in our survey @xcite and 354 gcs ( including 61 common gcs ) available in the literature . using the photometric and spectroscopic database of these gcs",
    ", we have investigated the kinematics of the gc system of m31 .",
    "our velocities are in good agreement with published values for objects in common , with a typical error of 35.3 km / s .",
    "primary results are summarized below :    1 .",
    "the mean value and dispersion of the radial velocities for the 211 gcs measured in this study are @xmath303 km s@xmath1 and @xmath304 km s@xmath1 , respectively . using all 504 gcs in the master catalog ,",
    "we obtain the mean value and dispersion of the radial velocities as @xmath120 km  s@xmath1 and @xmath96 km  s@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "2 .   for all gcs , the rotation amplitude estimated by fitting the rotation curve is @xmath305 km s@xmath1 , while the one from the velocity histogram is @xmath306 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the rotation amplitude decreases as the distance along the minor axis of m31 increases .",
    "however , the rotation amplitude is not zero for the outermost samples at @xmath2 kpc , indicating an extended rotating bulge or a hot rotating halo .",
    "we have identified 50 friendless gcs among all 504 gcs .",
    "it appears that the friendless gcs rotate around the major axis of m31 unlike the rotation around the minor axis for the disk population , which calls for more sophisticated investigation . a ks test yields that the difference between the friendless and normal gcs is significant for the distribution of @xmath68 magnitude and ( @xmath149 ) color .",
    "4 .   for the subsamples of the metal - poor gcs and metal - rich gcs",
    ", it is found that the metal - rich gcs are more centrally concentrated than the metal - poor gcs , and that the rotation amplitudes for the metal - poor gcs and metal - rich gcs are similar .",
    "for the subsamples of bright and faint gcs , it is found that the bright gcs are more centrally concentrated than the faint gcs , and that the rotation for the faint gcs is stronger than that for bright gcs .",
    "the rotation - corrected velocity dispersion for all gcs is estimated to be @xmath4 km s@xmath1 , and it increases from @xmath5 km s@xmath1 at @xmath6 kpc to @xmath7 km s@xmath1 at @xmath2 kpc .",
    "these results are very similar to those for the metal - poor gcs .",
    "this shows that there is a dynamically hot halo in m31 that is rotating but primarily pressure - supported .",
    "we have identified 56 gcs and gc candidates with x - ray detection including 39 genuine gcs with measured velocities .",
    "kinematic difference between the x - ray emitting and other gcs is not significant at this stage , but further studies are needed with an expanded sample of x - ray emitting gcs .",
    "the photometric properties of the x - ray emitting gcs show that the gcs that are redder , more metal - rich , and brighter are more likely to be detected as x - ray emitting gcs , as seen for gcs in early - type galaxies 7 .",
    "we derived the rotation curve of m31 using the metal - poor gcs at @xmath214 kpc from 8.9 to 46.4 arcmin .",
    "the rotation curve using the gcs in this study is consistent with those using other tracers in the range @xmath307 except for that based on pne of @xcite .",
    "the dynamical mass of m31 using the kinematic information of the gcs in this study is estimated to be @xmath235 out to a radius of @xmath308 kpc using the pme , and @xmath12 at @xmath309 kpc using the tme .",

    "<S> for the subsamples of bright and faint gcs , it is found that the rotation for the faint gcs is stronger than that for the bright gcs . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified 56 gcs and gc candidates with x - ray detection including 39 genuine gcs with measured velocities . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the majority of x - ray emitting gcs follow the disk rotation , and that the redder , more metal - rich , and brighter gcs are more likely to be detected as x - ray emitting gcs , as seen for gcs in early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived a rotation curve of m31 using the gcs at @xmath8 kpc , and it agrees well for the range of @xmath9 to that based on other tracers except for the planetary nebulae . </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated the dynamical mass of m31 using ` projected mass estimator ( pme ) ' and ` tracer mass estimator ( tme ) ' as @xmath10 out to a radius of @xmath11 kpc and @xmath12 for a radius of @xmath13 kpc , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we finally discuss the implication of these results and compare the kinematics of gcs with that of planetary nebulae in m31 . </S>"
