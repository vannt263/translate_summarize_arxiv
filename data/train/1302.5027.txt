    "<S> furthermore , they offer new ways for implementing spin - based quantum computation . @xcite both iii - v compounds and group - iv materials are considered and operated in the conduction band ( cb , electrons ) @xcite and in the valence band ( vb , holes ) @xcite regime . </S>",

    "<S> recently , qubits have also been implemented in insb nw qds,@xcite a system for which extremely large electron @xmath0 factors have been found . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , the strong hyperfine interaction in inas and insb is considered the dominant source for the short coherence times observed . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the latter may therefore be substantially prolonged in group - iv nws that can be grown nuclear - spin - free . in this context , </S>",
    "<S> ge and si have emerged as promising materials for nanoscale systems such as lateral qds , @xcite self - assembled qds , @xcite cylindrical core / shell nws , @xcite and ultrathin , triangular nws . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    for applications in spintronics and quantum information processing , it can be advantageous to consider holes instead of electrons . </S>",
    "<S> due to the @xmath4-wave symmetry of the bloch states , holes experience a strong spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) on the atomic level leading to an effective spin @xmath5 behavior . </S>",
    "<S> hence spin and momentum are coupled strongly which allows efficient control of the hole spin by electrical means . furthermore , hole spin lifetimes are prolonged in the presence of confinement . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in ge / si core / shell nws , the large vb offset leads to an accumulation of holes in the core . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite they form a one dimensional ( 1d ) hole gas with an unusually large , tunable rashba - type soi , referred to as direct rashba soi ( drsoi ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this drsoi makes ge / si core / shell nws attractive candidates for quantum information processing via electric - dipole induced spin resonance , @xcite and we mention that signatures of a tunable rashba soi were already deduced from magnetotransport experiments . </S>",

    "<S> we find the effective @xmath0 factor @xmath6 of this subsystem which turns out to be strongly anisotropic and tunable by choosing the direction and magnitude of applied electric fields . for small electric fields , </S>",
    "<S> we perturbatively derive an effective subspace hamiltonian and the according hole spin phonon coupling and calculate the hole spin relaxation rate @xmath7 . at small zeeman splittings </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 we observe a @xmath9 proportionality of @xmath7 which contrasts the @xmath10 behavior found for electrons in qds . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the magnitude of @xmath7 depends strongly on the direction of the magnetic field with respect to the wire . </S>",
    "<S> for zero electric field , aligning the magnetic field perpendicular to the wire results in very long @xmath1 of the order of tens of milliseconds . directing the magnetic field along the wire results in a much shorter @xmath1 . for both configurations , </S>",
    "<S> the dephasing is zero , hence the decoherence time is given by @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> applying small electric fields can enhance the relaxation rate by several orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this effect depends strongly on the direction of the electric field with respect to the magnetic field . </S>",

    "<S> we add the corresponding curves for @xmath96 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : relaxrate105fields ] , dashed ) to allow for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> for both orientations of @xmath54 , @xmath7 is enhanced significantly for larger @xmath145 . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to phonons of the @xmath162 mode coupling @xmath163 and @xmath164 via a combination of @xmath165 and @xmath44 which dominates @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> due to cylindrical symmetry , applying @xmath150 for @xmath140 results in the same effect as described for @xmath146 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , in stark contrast to @xmath166 , only minor changes with respect to the curve at @xmath96 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : relaxrate105fields ] , dotted ) are observed when @xmath150 and @xmath139 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : relaxrate105fields ] , dashed ) . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> the dominant contributions of @xmath151 are already present in @xmath151 for @xmath96 .    in both cases , @xmath96 and @xmath167 , increasing the relative shell thickness @xmath168 shifts the @xmath7 curves to slightly larger @xmath145 and lowers the peak height , e.g.  increasing @xmath168 from @xmath169 to @xmath170 reduces @xmath7 by a factor @xmath171 . however , decreasing ( increasing ) @xmath35 and @xmath36 while keeping @xmath168 constant has no substantial effect on @xmath7 aside from slight shifts to the right ( left ) on the @xmath145 axis . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , for @xmath96 and for @xmath150 and @xmath139 , enhancing the confinement length @xmath161 lowers @xmath172 since the short wavelength regime is reached for smaller @xmath145 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is quite large , for instance raising @xmath161 from @xmath173 to @xmath174 tunes @xmath172 by factors between @xmath175 and @xmath176 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for @xmath146 and @xmath140 or @xmath139 , increasing @xmath161 results in larger @xmath172 . from this analysis </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that there exist optimal configurations of @xmath54 and @xmath52 in order to obtain long @xmath1 in this type of nw qd . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 should be applied perpendicular to the nw and the optional @xmath52 should lie perpendicular to both @xmath54 and the nw . for vanishing @xmath54 , as pointed out in ref .  , two - phonon processes @xcite might become relevant .    in the bloch - redfield framework , the decoherence time is given by @xmath177 , where @xmath178 denotes the dephasing time . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for @xmath96 , we find @xmath3 because the corresponding spectral function is super - ohmic and gives @xmath179 . for @xmath180 the soi results in a non - zero dephasing term @xmath181 and hence @xmath182 .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have examined effective zeeman splitting and hole spin dynamics for holes in the lowest vb of a ge / si core / shell nw qd . </S>",
    "<S> we reported a highly anisotropic effective @xmath0 factor which is strongly tunable by applying electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated relaxation rates and found configurations of electric and magnetic fields which correspond to very long spin relaxation times . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we pointed out that the relative shell thickness and the qd confinement length influence the spin relaxation time . </S>",
