    "for integer @xmath0 , _ elliptic polylogarithms _ that resemble @xmath16 were introduced by beilinson - levin in @xcite , and further studied in @xcite in relation to motivic cohomology conjectures for elliptic curves . for a recent survey on the better - known dilogarithm ,",

    "the @xmath0-polylogarithms for noninteger @xmath0 are also classical and modern objects .",
