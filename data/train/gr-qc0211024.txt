    "penrose introduced the seminal idea that the gravitational field of isolated systems can be conveniently described by means of the notion of asymptotic simplicity @xcite .",
    "central to the concept of asymptotic simplicity is the idea expectation that the conformal boundary of the spacetime null infinity , @xmath0 should possess a smooth differentiable structure .",
    "this approach to the description of isolated bodies in general relativity is usually known as _",
    "penrose s proposal _",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "static and stationary spacetimes have been shown to be ( weakly ) asymptotically simple , with a smooth null infinity @xcite . however , the main purpose behind introducing the concept of asymptotic simplicity is to provide a suitable framework for the discussion of radiation . in spite of its elegance and aesthetical appeal , penrose s proposal",
    "is of little use if one is not able to prove that there exists a big family of non - trivial ( in the radiative sense ) asymptotically simple solutions to the einstein field equations .",
    "a programme aimed to investigate the existence of such solutions , and provide a conclusive `` answer '' to penrose s proposal has been started by friedrich see e.g. @xcite .",
    "his strategy is based on the use of the so - called conformal field equations , which allow us to work and prove existence statements directly in the conformally rescaled , `` unphysical '' spacetime .",
    "along this lines , friedrich has been able to prove a semiglobal existence result that ensures that hyperboloidal initial data close to minkowski data yields an asymptotically simple development which includes the point @xmath1 ( future timelike infinity ) @xcite .",
    "recently , chruciel & delay @xcite retaking an old idea by cutler & wald @xcite using a refined version of some initial data set constructed by corvino @xcite have been able to prove the existence of a big class of non - trivial ( radiative ) asymptotically simple spacetimes .",
    "corvino s initial data is constructed so that it is schwarzschildean in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity , @xmath2 .",
    "this means that the radiation content in the spacetime arising from the development of the data is somehow special .",
    "this can be seen directly from the fact that the newman - penrose constants of the spacetime are zero @xcite .",
    "chruciel & delay s result is no doubt very important .",
    "however , it is not as general as one would like .",
    "it has been suspected for a long time now that the region of spacetime where null infinity and spatial infinity meet is somehow problematic see e.g. @xcite . from the analysis of the hyperboloidal initial value problem it turns out that the smoothness of null infinity is preserved by the evolution if smooth data sufficiently close to minkowski data are prescribed .",
    "the latter indicates that somehow the `` decision '' of having a smooth structure at null infinity is made in an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of spatial infinity . in some sense",
    ", corvino s data avoids all the intricacies and complications of this region of spacetime by setting the asymptotic end in the simplest way which is consistent with the presence of a non - vanishing adm mass on the initial hypersurface . in connection with this",
    ", friedrich @xcite has performed a detailed first analysis of the behaviour of the gravitational field arising from asymptotically euclidean , time symmetric initial data in the region where null infinity `` touches '' spatial infinity . by means of a novel representation of spatial infinity in which the point @xmath2 of the standard conformal picture is blown up to a cylinder @xmath3  the cylinder at spatial infinity a certain regularity condition on the cotton - bach tensor and symmetrised higher order derivatives of it has been obtained .",
    "the hope was that this regularity condition would ensure the smoothness of null infinity , at least in the region close to @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "a subsequent analysis by friedrich & knnr @xcite of the first orders of some expansions that can be obtained by evaluating the conformal field equations at @xmath3 , lead to conjecture that friedrich s regularity condition is the only condition one has to impose on time symmetric , initial data possessing an analytic compactification in order to obtain a development with smooth null infinity @xcite .",
    "more precisely ,    there exists an integer @xmath4 such hat for given @xmath5 the time evolution of an asymptotically euclidean , time symmetric , conformally smooth initial data set admits a conformal extension to null infinity of class @xmath6 near spacelike infinity , if the cotton - bach spinor is related to the cotton - bach spinor via : @xmath7 this correspondence is carried out by the infeld - van der waerden symbols . ]",
    "satisfies the condition , @xmath8 for a certain integer @xmath9 .",
    "if the extension is of class @xmath10 then the condition should hold to all orders .",
    "the objective of this paper is to provide a further insight into the conjecture above .",
    "it will turn out that the conjecture , as it stands , is false . in order to see why",
    "this is the case , the expansions of knnr & friedrich will be carried to an even higher order .",
    "this requires the implementation of the conformal field equations on a computer algebra system ( maple v ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that despite the use of the computer to perform the expansions , the results here presented are exact up to the order carried out . in order to simplify our discussion ,",
    "the analysis will be restricted to developments of time symmetric conformally flat initial data .",
    "the time symmetry requirement stems from the fact that friedrich s analysis has only yet been carried for this class of data .",
    "a similar analysis of initial data with non - vanishing second fundamental form lies still in the future .",
    "however , some first steps have already been carried out @xcite .",
    "the conformal flatness of the data ensures that the initial data satisfies the regularity condition trivially .",
    "again , the construction of non - conformally flat data satisfying friedrich s regularity condition is a non - trivial endeavour whose undertaking will be left for future studies . in the light of the results here presented ,",
    "it turns out that the restriction to the class of conformally flat data is not a drawback .",
    "furthermore , it is not hard to guess how the results could generalise in the case of general time symmetric data .",
    "the principal result of our investigation is the following ,    necessary conditions for the development of initial data which are time symmetric , conformally flat in a neighbourhood @xmath11 of ( spatial ) infinity to be smooth at the intersection of null infinity and spatial infinity are that the newman - penrose constants @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the higher order newman - penrose constants , @xmath14 , @xmath15 vanish .",
    "a more precise formulation of the theorem , including the definition of the newman - penrose constants and the higher order newman - penrose constants in terms of the initial data will be given in the main text .",
    "we note that the previous conditions are fulfilled by the schwarzschild initial data .",
    "the theorem has been obtained from the analysis , up to order @xmath16 of expansions constructed from the solutions of the transport equations induced by the conformal field equations upon evaluation on the cylinder at spatial infinity . from the evidence provided by the equations it is not unreasonable to conjecture that similar conditions arise if one were to obtain expansions to even higher orders .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the whole set up of the cylinder at spatial infinity is completely regular for schwarzschildean data .",
    "thus , the hypothetic new conditions must be satisfied by the schwarzschild initial data .",
    "it is on this ground that the following conjecture is put forward :    if an initial data set which is time symmetric and conformally flat in a neighbourhood @xmath11 of the point @xmath17 yields a development with a smooth null infinity , then the initial data are in fact schwarzschildean in @xmath11 .    again , a more technical version of the conjecture is given in the main text .",
    "the article is structured as follows : in section 2 a brief summary of the description of spacetime in the neighbourhood of spatial and null infinities in terms of the cylinder at spatial infinity is given .",
    "this digest has the intention of providing all the tools needed for the calculations described in the present article .",
    "particular attention is paid to the spatial 2-spinor formalism and to the expansions of functions on @xmath18 in terms of unitary representations of @xmath19 .",
    "the reader is , in any case , remitted to @xcite for a more extensive discussion . in section 3 ,",
    "the conformal field equations written in the conformal geodesic gauge are discussed .",
    "the initial data for the latter in the case of an asymptotically euclidean , time symmetric , conformally flat initial hypersurface are described .",
    "the transport equations implied by the conformal field equations on the cylinder at spatial infinity are introduced in section 4 . in order to properly motivate the calculations carried out in later sections , a careful discussion of their properties",
    "is undertaken .",
    "section 5 contains the new results to be presented in the article . here a description of the solution of the transport equations is done . due to the large size of the expressions involved",
    ", the description will be focused on what we believe are the most relevant features of the solutions .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that everything has been explicitly calculated .",
    "the main conclusions extracted from the calculations is presented as our main theorem . in order to understand the meaning of the conditions presented in the main theorem ,",
    "the schwarzschild solution is discussed in this context , and a conjecture is formulated . finally , in section 6 , some conclusions and extensions of the present work are considered .",
    "there is also an appendix in which the implementation of the transport equations and how to solve them in the computer algebra system maple v is briefly considered .",
    "let @xmath20 be a vacuum spacetime arising as the development of asymptotically euclidean , time symmetric , conformally analytic initial data @xmath21 .",
    "later , we will restrict the class of initial data sets under discussion to those conformally flat around infinity .",
    "assume for simplicity that @xmath22 possesses only one asymptotic end .",
    "let @xmath17 be the infinity corresponding to that end .",
    "the point @xmath17 is obtained by conformally compactifying the initial hypersurface @xmath22 , with an analytic conformal factor @xmath23 which can be obtained from solving the time symmetric constraint equations .",

    "unless some remarkable property of the conformal field equations comes into stage , the solution vector @xmath243 will contain some logarithmic terms and consequently also the coefficients @xmath231 .",
    "the algebraic structure of the integral in ( [ reduced_solution ] ) is too complicated to analyse directly without resorting to some further ( still unknown ) structure of the field equations . in order to shed some light into this direction ,",
    "friedrich & knnr have performed an analysis of the solutions of the transport equations up to order @xmath244 under the assumption that the initial data satisfies the condition ( [ regcond ] ) .",
    "quite remarkably they found that no logarithms appeared in the solutions .",
    "this meant that somehow , the simple poles in ( [ reduced_solution ] ) cancel out up to the order under consideration .",
    "at this point it is important to mention that due to the gauge conditions used in the whole construction , we know that the logarithmic singularities occurring in the solutions to the transport equations are associated with the conformal structure , and are not artifacts of a choice of gauge .",
    "note that the condition equation ( [ regcond ] ) is conformally invariant .",
    "it allows us to identify obstructions to the smoothness of null infinity explicitly in terms of the initial data .",
    "also , because of the hyperbolic nature of the equations suggest that if logarithmic terms are present in the solutions of the transport equations , then it is very likely these will propagate along @xmath0 .",
    "on simplicity and aesthetical grounds it is natural to wonder whether the regularity condition , equation ( [ regcond ] ) , is the only requirement one has to impose on the initial data in order to obtain solutions to the transport equations which are smooth see for example the discussion in @xcite . before trying to prove some statement along this lines , it is of clear interest to calculate the some further order in the expansions . the rationale behind it being firstly to verify whether the conjecture still holds , and secondly to try to find some patterns in the solutions that one could exploit in an eventual abstract proof .",
    "in order to simplify the calculations , we have chosen to restrict our attention to those time symmetric initial data sets which are conformally flat .",
    "these satisfy the regularity condition ( [ regcond ] ) in a trivial way .",
    "thus , they represent the simplest ( non - trivial ) class of initial data sets one can look at .",
    "their simplicity is somehow deceiving , and should not be regarded as a drawback on the kind of insight that can be gained through them . a great deal about the solutions of the einstein field equations",
    "has been learned from the analysis of this class of initial data see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the already `` big '' transport equation systems ( [ v_transport])-([b_transport ] ) do not give an appropriate dimension of the computational difficulties one has to face if one is to take the expansions carried in @xcite to even higher orders . however , the calculations one has to carry are suitable to a treatment using a computer algebra system . in order to analyse with ease the solutions of the transport equations some scripts in the computer algebra system maple v have been written .",
    "the reader is remitted to the appendix for further details on the implementation of the calculations on this system .    because of the largeness of the expressions contained inthe solutions , we have opted to provide a description of the qualitative features of the expansions rather than a complete list of all the terms calculated . in particular , attention will be focused on the solutions to the transport equations arising from the bianchi identities , the functions @xmath231 .",
    "it should be emphasized that this does not mean that the solutions to the @xmath125 unknown transport equations are not important .",
    "they are also crucial : a tiny mistake in the calculation of their solutions would destroy the whole structure of the solutions .",
    "however , as the discussion in the previous section has pointed out , the logarithmic terms that destroy the smoothness of null infinity appear firstly in the components of the weyl spinor .    in order to perform our expansions a number of assumptions",
    "have been made .",
    "we list them here for the purposes of a quick reference .",
    "it will be assumed that :    * the initial data set is asymptotically euclidean and time symmetric . * in a neighbourhood @xmath11 of @xmath17 the initial data is assumed to be conformally flat . the function @xmath131 appearing in the conformal factor of the initial hypersurface see equation ( [ omega_conformal_factor]) is a solution of the laplace equation admitting in @xmath11 a decomposition of the form , @xmath245 where @xmath246 with the coefficients @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 complex numbers satisfying @xmath250 so that @xmath131 is a real valued function .",
    "this is in consistency with the decomposition given in equation ( [ expansion_for_w ] ) .",
    "* likewise , the components of the vector unknowns @xmath173 and @xmath174 admit on @xmath3 expansions in terms of @xmath251 functions consistent with lemma [ lemma : expansion_types ] . *",
    "the two following choices of the function @xmath37 see equation ( [ conformal_factor]) will be considered : @xmath252    the result of the calculations under these assumptions are now described .",
    "firstly , calculations for the orders @xmath254 , @xmath255 and @xmath244 were undertaken .",
    "the results are in complete agreement with those given by friedrich & knnr when reduced to the case of conformally flat initial data .",
    "the solutions at order @xmath256 can be schematically written as ,    @xmath257    independently of the choice of @xmath37 . at order @xmath254",
    "one has ,    @xmath258    when @xmath259 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath260 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 and @xmath263 for the choice @xmath264 are similar .",
    "that of @xmath265 is given by , @xmath266    at order @xmath255 one has ,    @xmath267    where @xmath268 , @xmath269 are polynomials on @xmath31 .",
    "their explicit form is not relevant for our purposes .",
    "the polynomials are slightly different for each of the choices of @xmath37 , but of the same order .",
    "similarly , the components of the weyl tensor at order @xmath244 are of the form ,    @xmath270    again , the functions @xmath271 , @xmath272 are polynomials , while @xmath273 is a constant .",
    "the first new order corresponds to @xmath274 . here , again , the solutions are still fully regular and polynomial :    @xmath275    again , the functions @xmath276 , @xmath277 are polynomials .",
    "the calculation of the solutions to the bianchi transport equations up to order @xmath274 have shown that all of them are polynomial , and thus smooth at @xmath233 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath125 unknowns also happen to be polynomial .",
    "the first modifications to this behaviour occur at the rather high order @xmath279 .",
    "feeding the solution of the transport equations up to order @xmath274 into the @xmath125 transport equations ( [ v_transport ] ) with @xmath279 and solving one finds again that the components of @xmath280 are again polynomial . however ,",
    "the solution of the bianchi transport equations are of the form ,    @xmath281    where @xmath282 , @xmath283 , @xmath284 are non - relevant non - zero numerical factors , @xmath285 @xmath286 are polynomials analogous to , for example , those in ( [ phi_order4a])-([phi_order4e ] ) , depending on @xmath130 , @xmath287 , @xmath288 , @xmath289 , @xmath290 , their @xmath62 derivatives and products of them .",
    "most remarkably , @xmath291 where ,    @xmath292    thus , the coefficients @xmath12 are ( besides an irrelevant numerical factor ) the newman - penrose constants of the development of the time symmetric conformally flat initial data @xcite .",
    "plugging the solutions ( [ p0_5])-([p4_5 ] ) into the transport equations for @xmath16 one finds that the solutions of the sectors of the form @xmath293 develop terms containing @xmath294 and @xmath295 .",
    "furthermore , the sectors @xmath296 in @xmath297 contain logarithms .",
    "more precisely , the solution will be of the form , @xmath298 where @xmath299 , and @xmath300 are polynomials .",
    "the coefficients @xmath301 are new obstructions to the smoothness of the solutions .",
    "these will be discussed a bit later .",
    "it is not hard to imagine that from this point onwards , terms containing @xmath295 , @xmath302 and higher order powers of them will spread all around the solutions to the transport equations . instead of analysing this phenomenon",
    ", we will rather focus on the smooth solutions .    setting the newman - penrose constants to zero ,",
    "the solution at order @xmath16 is of the form ,    @xmath303    with @xmath304 polynomials , and @xmath305 where the coefficients @xmath14 , @xmath306 are given in terms of initial data quantities by ,    @xmath307    in analogy to the order @xmath279 we will refer to these coefficients as to the _ order @xmath308 newman - penrose `` constants''_. one is naturally bound to ask whether the coefficients @xmath301 are actually associated to some conserved quantities at null infinity in the same way that the coefficients @xmath309 are .",
    "this consideration is beyond the scope of the present article , and will be analysed in detail in future work .",
    "it is pointed out , as a plausibility argument , that in the analysis of polyhomogeneous bondi expansions carried out in for example @xcite , the first logarithmic terms appearing in the expansions were associated with a conserved quantity on null infinity . as it can be seen from our discussion , if @xmath310 , then the first logarithmic terms appearing in our expansions are precisely those associated to @xmath301 .",
    "notwithstanding , the expansions described here are based in the conformal geodesics gauge , while those in @xcite use the so - called bondi gauge .",
    "thus , one would have to look in detail the possible appearance of logarithmic terms in the transformation connecting the two gauges .",
    "necessary conditions for the development of initial data which is time symmetric and conformally flat in a neighbourhood @xmath11 of ( spatial ) infinity to be smooth on the set @xmath311 are that the newman - penrose constants , @xmath12 , @xmath312 , should vanish . furthermore ,",
    "the `` higher order '' newman - penrose constants , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , should also vanish .",
    "if only the coefficients @xmath12 vanish then the rescaled weyl spinor is at most @xmath313 on a neighbourhood of either @xmath314 or @xmath315 .",
    "if both @xmath309 and @xmath301 vanish then generically the weyl tensor will be at most of class @xmath316 of the latter neighbourhoods .",
    "from the last result one can extract directly the following ( important ) consequence :    the regularity condition ( [ regcond ] ) is not a sufficient condition for the smoothness at @xmath311 of the development of asymptotically euclidean , time symmetric initial data sets .",
    "this corollary is , thus , a negative answer to the conjecture raised in @xcite .",
    "it is nevertheless surprising that the obstructions to the smoothness of null infinity arise at such a high order in the expansions . in order to acquire a deeper understanding of why this is the case would require in turn an abstract understanding of the algebraic structure of the transport equations ( [ v_transport ] ) and ( [ b_transport ] ) .",
    "it is not unreasonable to reckon that some group theoretical properties of the whole set up play a major role here .",
    "the theorem also suggest the following un expected conjecture :    the developments of the brill - lindquist and misner initial data sets possess non - smooth null infinities .    in @xcite",
    "the newman - penrose constants of the brill - lindquist and misner data sets @xcite have been calculated using the formula found by friedrich & knnr @xcite . due to the axial symmetry",
    ", there is only one non - vanishing newman - penrose constant .",
    "furthermore , the constant vanishes if and only if the data sets are actually the schwarzschild initial data . that the development of these two initial data sets possess a non - smooth null infinity may have implications in the description of their late time behaviour in terms of linear perturbations on a schwarzschild background .",
    "some remarks regarding the theorem come also into place :    * remark 1 .",
    "* the calculations for the order @xmath317 are already beyond the capabilities of maple v the expressions involved are too large for the simplification routines of the computer algebra system , even for an origin computer available at the albert einstein institute",
    ". nevertheless , the calculations of axially symmetric situations are still possible .",
    "these have been carried out for the orders @xmath317 and @xmath318 inclusive .",
    "assuming that both @xmath309 and @xmath301 vanish , the solutions of the bianchi transport equations have again the expected form : @xmath319 where now due to the axial symmetry there is only one order @xmath320 newman - penrose constant , @xmath321 if in turn @xmath322 vanishes , @xmath323 with , @xmath324 from this evidence it is not too hard to guess the following general formula for the obstructions of the smoothness of null infinity in the axial situation , @xmath325 the proof of such a formula is nevertheless beyond our current understanding of the transport equations .",
    "the significance of the latter expression will be discussed in short .",
    "* remark 2 . * in the non - axially symmetric case , it is conjectured that obstructions to the smoothness of null infinity ( generalised newman - penrose constants ) are given in terms of the initial data by the following expressions , @xmath326 with @xmath327 , where the coefficients @xmath328 are some numerical constants .      as mentioned before , the newman - penrose constants of the schwarzschild spacetime are all zero .",
    "thus , in order to gain some insight into the significance of the expressions ( [ axial_higher_np ] ) and ( [ nonaxial_higher_np ] ) it is convenient to see what occurs in the case of the schwarzschild initial data .    it is not complicate although certainly messy to calculate an expression for initial data for the schwarzschild on the slice of time symmetry .",
    "on this slice the initial 3-metric is conformally flat .",
    "thus , the required ( harmonic ) conformal factor can be calculated directly from the green function for the three dimensional laplace equation in spherical coordinates .",
    "the green function is given by , @xmath329 for @xmath330 .",
    "the latter expression can be lifted into the frame bundle @xmath40 and written in terms of the functions @xmath251 using formula ( [ y_to_t ] ) to get , @xmath331 where @xmath332 denote the coordinates of the singularity of the green function on the frame bundle . thus , the @xmath333 are fixed complex numbers .",
    "we write , @xmath334 for @xmath335 and @xmath336 .",
    "the latter coefficients are not independent but related to each other via recurrence relations , like @xmath337 these can be readily obtained from similar recurrence relations holding for the spherical harmonics .",
    "the schwarzschild solution has an obvious axial symmetry .",
    "if one considers an orientation of the coordinate system in a way that makes this symmetry of the initial data explicit the singularity of the green function is set along the @xmath338 axis one ends up with a much simplified expression , @xmath339 so that the only non - vanishing @xmath340 coefficients are given by , @xmath341 one obtains precisely this expression if one requires that the hierarchy of axial newman - penrose constants , formula ( [ axial_higher_np ] ) , vanishes at every order @xmath165 .",
    "it is however important to point out that this is not a proof but again a plausibility argument as formula ( [ axial_higher_np ] ) has only been verified up to order @xmath318 .",
    "a much more involved calculation shows that the expressions one obtains for the coefficients @xmath342 and @xmath343 by setting @xmath309 and @xmath301 to zero are precisely those one has for the schwarzschild initial data .",
    "this involves the use of the recurrence relation ( [ recurrence ] ) .",
    "now , the fuction @xmath131 is a solution to @xmath344 , and thus analytic .",
    "this in turn implies that the function @xmath131 one deduces from requiring the coefficients ( [ axial_higher_np ] ) to vanish at all orders @xmath165 is exactly schwarzschildean .",
    "this evidence leads to the following ,    [ precise formulation ] for every @xmath345 there exists a @xmath346 such that the time evolution of an asymptotically euclidean , time symmetric , conformal flat , conformally smooth initial data set admits a conformal extension to null infinity of class @xmath6 near spacelike infinity , if and only if the initial data set is schwarzschildean to order @xmath347 .",
    "the latter is the successor of the conjecture , in the context of time symmetric conformally flat , of the conjecture by friedrich @xcite to which reference was made in the introduction .",
    "the results presented in the main theorem together with the considerations leading to the conjecture put forward in section 5 seem to suggest that no gravitational radiation should be present around spatial infinity if one is to have a smooth null infinity . in other words",
    ", the notion of smooth null infinity seems to be incompatible with the presence of radiation around @xmath2 . whether this behaviour of spacetime in the neighbourhood of spatial infinity has some implications on either the demeanour of the sources of the gravitational field in the infinite past or on the nature of incoming radiation travelling from past null infinity is a naturally arising question .",
    "a natural extension of the calculations here described would be to consider what happens with more general ( i.e. not conformally flat ) time symmetric initial data .",
    "if the time symmetric initial data is not conformally flat , then the newman - penrose constants are given in terms of the initial data by , @xmath348 where @xmath349 are coefficients appearing in the expansion of the ricci scalar @xmath350 of the initial @xmath351-metric , around spatial infinity .",
    "in the view of the present results one would expect to have the quantities @xmath352 appearing as obstructions to the smoothness of null infinity .",
    "similarly , one would expect to obtain generalisations @xmath353 of the higher order newman - penrose constants @xmath14 by adding suitable expressions containing the ricci scalar .",
    "ultimately , one would like to prove that there is an infinite hierarchy of such quantities as obstructions to the smoothness of @xmath0 .",
    "the relation of these quantities with static initial data is to be analysed , at least for the first orders",
    ". it could well be the case that a time symmetric initial data set will yield a development with smooth null infinity only if it is static in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity . in relation to this",
    ", it is noted that the asymptotically euclidean static initial data satisfy the regularity condition ( [ regcond ] ) see @xcite .    with regard to a proof to the conjecture presented in this article",
    ", it is noted that it would require a much deeper understanding of the properties of the transport equations at spatial infinity that the one currently available .",
    "in particular one would like to be able to discuss its algebraic properties in a much more abstract way , and with out having to resort to `` explicit expressions '' as it was done here . as mentioned before",
    ", group theoretical properties of the set up should play a crucial role here .",
    "i thank h. friedrich who suggested the problem and helped with discussions and clarifications all along the long winding road .",
    "i also thank s. dain and m. mars from which i have benefited through several discussions .",
    "the calculations described in this article are hefty , however quite amenable to the use of computer algebra systems . in the present case",
    "the computer algebra system maple v was used .",
    "the main source of difficulties in solving the transport equations implied by the conformal field equation on the cylinder at spatial infinity is not the actual procedure of solving the equations , but producing the equations that have to be solved . to understand why this is the case , we recall the quasilinear nature of the transport equations . accordingly , in the construction of the equations for the diverse spherical sectors of the various unknowns one encounters products of the functions @xmath251 , which have to be expanded using the formula ( [ monster ] ) , which in turn requires the computation of several clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "the number of these products heavily increases as one considers higher and higher expansions orders .",
    "there are maple v scripts available in the web .",
    "we have made use of those written by a. b. coates @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of the computer algebra implementation , the diverse spinor arising have been considered as arrays running on the set of indices @xmath354 . in this way",
    "all the elementary spinors introduced in section 2.1 can be readily defined .",
    "for example , the spinor @xmath355 would be encoded as , @xmath356:=0 : x[0,1]:=1/sqrt(2 ) : x[1,0]:=1/sqrt(2 ) : x[1,1]:=0:}\\ ] ] the functions @xmath251 have also been considered as arrays , t[j , k , l ] with empty entries , so that they can be manipulated formally as symbols ( names , in the maple v terminology ) . with this idea in mind , scripts that evaluate @xmath62 derivatives according to the usual rules and take complex conjugates of expressions containing @xmath251 have been written .",
    "two further scripts , one implementing the formula ( [ monster ] ) to express products of @xmath251 s as linear combinations of @xmath251 s , texpand , and another that given a expression collects the terms possessing the same @xmath251 , tcollect , are the core of our implementation .    in order to compute the expansions up to a given order @xmath165 one",
    "proceeds in two steps .",
    "firstly , one has to compute the initial data for the conformal propagation equations . as described in the main text we have restricted our implementation to time symmetric , conformally flat initial data .",
    "the computer algebra construction of time symmetric data satisfying the regularity condition ( [ regcond ] ) is a project on its own right that we expect to address in the near future . in the case of time symmetric ,",
    "conformally flat data the whole free data is contained in a function @xmath131 solution of the laplace equation . in order to calculate the solution of the transport equations up to say , order @xmath165 one needs to expand the function @xmath131 in @xmath27 up to order @xmath165 .",
    "thus , the main input of the script that calculates the initial data for the transport equations are the essentially the order of expansion p and the function kappa corresponding to the remaining conformal freedom available in our setting .",
    "two choices have been used , @xmath259 and @xmath264 . the function @xmath131 is provided as an object of type series in the form , @xmath357+sum('sum('(1/(i)!)*w[i,2*i , k]*t[2*i , k , i]*rho\\hat{\\phantom{x } } i ' , } \\\\ & & { \\tt ' k'=0 .. 2*i)','i'=1 .. 6)+o(rho\\hat{\\phantom{x}}7):}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "two versions of the script have been written : one which deals with axially symmetric initial data , and the other dealing with general time symmetric , conformally flat initial data , i.e. data which assumes no symmetries .",
    "the computations carried in these scripts are essentially completely automatised ( i.e. no human intervention is required ) , and their output is saved directly .",
    "the actual computation and solving of the transport equations is carried out in a second stage .",
    "given an order p the scripts load first the results of the previous orders , and then proceeds to the most computationally expansive part of the script : the calculation of the transport equations at order p. as discussed in the main text , for a given order one needs first to calculate and solve the so - called @xmath125 equations . using our definitions of spinors as arrays ,",
    "the transport equations can be readily coded .",
    "for example , equation ( [ p1 ] ) would be coded as : @xmath358:=-diff(c0[p , a , b],tau ) } \\\\ & & { \\tt    \\phantom{>foraforb}-sum('binomial(p , k)*sum('sum('sum('sum('eup[e , r]*eup[s , t]*chi[k , a , b , r , t ] } \\\\ & & { \\tt \\phantom{>foraforb}*c0[p - k , e , s]','e'=0 .. 1)','r'=0 .. 1)','s'=0 .. 1)','t'=0 .. 1)','k'=0 .. p)-f[p , a , b ] : } \\\\ & & { \\tt > \\phantom{fora}od : } \\\\ & & { \\tt > od : } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the remaining equations , ( [ p2 ] ) to ( [ p7 ] ) , have been encoded in a similar way .",
    "the procedure tcollect is then used to write all the equations in the form of linear combination of the t[j , k , l ] s .",
    "using , tcollect the resulting expressions are then grouped .",
    "a further script then collects all the equations corresponding to a given mode and picks up the corresponding initial data .",
    "the systems of equations which in the generic case consists of 45 linear ordinary differential equations is using the dsolve procedure of maple v with the series option set on . in this way maple",
    "v calculates the solutions directly as series expansions .",
    "the order of the expansion is set sufficiently high , order:=60 , so that the series can truncate if the solutions correspond to polynomials .",
    "once the solutions have been calculated , the solutions are saved and the memory of the system is cleared .    the transport equations arising from the bianchi identities , ( [ b0])-([b4 ] ) , are likewise encoded and solved . as a check of correctness",
    ", the constraint equations ( [ c1])-([c3 ] ) , have also been programmed .",
    "after the solutions to the equations ( [ b0])-([b4 ] ) have been obtained , these are substituted in the equations ( [ c1])-([c3 ] ) which should be satisfied automatically . as discussed in the main text , at order @xmath279 and higher",
    "the solutions to some of the spherical sectors contain logarithms .",
    "these are firstly detected in the maple v computations as series solutions that do not truncate .",
    "for the cases when this occurs , some supplementary scripts have been written .",
    "these essentially implement the analysis carried in the section 4.1 .",
    "the scripts calculates the fundamental matrix of the system , and uses it to calculate the solution in a closed form so that the logarithms present in the expression are explicit .    in order to give an impression of the progressive calculational complexity of the whole procedure",
    ", it is noted that the calculations in the axially symmetric case for the orders @xmath359 have taken @xmath360 , @xmath361 , @xmath362 , @xmath363 , @xmath364 , @xmath365 , @xmath366 , and @xmath367 seconds respectively in a computer with a dell xeon computer ( processor speed of about @xmath368 and @xmath369 of ram memory ) .",
