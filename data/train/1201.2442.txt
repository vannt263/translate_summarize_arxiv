    "transitions in the dynamical behavior of open quantum systems may be seen for a variety of driven systems .",
    "notable examples include the laser  @xcite , atoms coupled to optical cavity modes such as in the micromaser  @xcite and pumped bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , mechanical resonators coupled to optical cavities  @xcite , and nanoelectromechanical systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , an alternative perspective on the dynamics of open quantum systems has been developed  @xcite by studying ensembles of quantum - jump trajectories .",
    "applying the so - called _ s - ensemble _",
    "@xcite has given insights into dynamical crossovers by extending the space of parameters  @xcite .",
    "the new parameter ` @xmath0 ' is a counting field which may be adjusted to give ensembles of trajectories biased towards fewer or more quantum jumps .",
    "varying @xmath0 allows the phase structure of quantum - jump trajectories to be explored in a way analogous to tuning parameters across an equilibrium phase transition , such as the temperature in a ferromagnetic transition .",
    "the @xmath0-ensemble is developed in a formalism using a large - deviation method  @xcite , which treats the statistics of dynamical trajectories in the same way equilibrium statistical mechanics treats statistical ensembles of configurations @xcite .",
    "just as order parameters , such as the magnetization for a ferromagnetic transition , are used to characterize configurations , we can use a dynamical order parameter to characterize quantum - jump trajectories .",
    "the number of quantum jumps @xmath1 in a given time @xmath2 is the extensive conjugate variable to the counting field @xmath0 .",

    "@xmath3 , defined as the number of quantum jumps in unit time @xmath4 , as a dynamical order parameter . characterizing dynamical phases in this way has been shown to give rich phase diagrams with phase boundaries marked by discontinuities in @xmath3 , or its derivative with respect to system parameters , occurring at first and second - order transitions  @xcite .",
    "for the unbiased physical dynamics when @xmath5 , the transitions typically appear rounded and we understand these to be crossovers in dynamical behavior , which become transitions in an appropriate thermodynamic limit  . ] .",
    "physical dynamics correspond to the @xmath5 ensemble of trajectories .",
    "the method gives a new perspective on these unbiased @xmath5 dynamics through the structure of phase diagrams parametrized by @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that the statistics of trajectories when @xmath6 can be inferred from accurate measurements of the physical trajectories .",
    "the @xmath0-ensemble has already shown interesting results for driven 2- and 3-level dissipative systems .",
    "for example , it has been shown that for a particular ratio of driving and dissipation  @xcite , the two - level system exhibits a surprising self - similarity in the fluctuation properties for all @xmath0 , so that all trajectories look the same if rescaled by the number of counts , @xmath3 .",
    "for the three - level system studied in  @xcite it was shown that the intermittent bursts of quantum jumps  @xcite in the dynamics arise from a sharp crossover in activity occurring at @xmath5 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , dynamical phases of the micromaser were studied .",
    "the micromaser consists of a series of two - level atoms passing through a microwave cavity in their excited state . as the flux of atoms",
    "is increased , the atoms drive the cavity through different dynamical states . it was shown that , as a function of the counting field @xmath0 and the atom flux , distinct dynamical phases are seen , characterized by different values of the activity .    in this paper , we examine a more complex system consisting of two coupled components with non - trivial internal dynamics .",
    "we study a system constructed by coupling a resonator to a superconducting single - electron transistor ( sset ) close to a josephson quasiparticle resonance ( jqp )  @xcite .",
    "both the resonator and sset are themselves open quantum systems because the resonator loses energy to its surroundings and cooper pairs on the sset break into quasiparticles which , one - by - one , decay incoherently off the sset into a second lead .",
    "this allows us alternative ways of generating trajectories ; we may either keep a time record of quanta emitted by the resonator or measure charges leaving the sset island . while sset - resonator systems were first demonstrated with nanomechanical beam resonators  @xcite , superconducting stripline resonators have also been used in more recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is the latter set up which , along with very recent progress towards detecting single microwave photons from stripline resonators  @xcite , motivates our study of quantum jump trajectories presented here .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ] , we introduce the open - system model for the sset and resonator before describing how the trajectories of the system may be studied using the @xmath0-ensemble . in section  [ exact ] , we present numerical results for the trajectories of quantum jumps in the resonator .",
    "then , in section  [ mean ] , we discuss a mean - field theory which describes the resonator limit cycles at @xmath5 . from this",
    "we develop an effective stochastic master equation for the resonator , from which we derive the activity of the resonator for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , in section  [ quasi ] we demonstrate briefly that studying the trajectories of quasiparticles allows the resonator trajectories to be inferred in certain regimes . in section  [ conclusions ] we state our conclusions .",
    "the tandem of a resonator weakly coupled to an sset near the jqp resonance may be explored with an open quantum system description  @xcite .",
    "the sset island consists of a left- and a right - hand josephson junction , a gate capacitor across which a gate voltage is applied and a capacitively - coupled resonator , shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic](a ) .",
    "the detuning from the jqp resonance in the left - hand josephson junction can be controlled with drain - source and gate voltages , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , while a resonator gate voltage also allows the strength of the coupling to the resonator to be adjusted .",
    "near the jqp resonance , cooper pairs tunnel coherently across a josephson junction , causing oscillations between sset island states @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with zero and two extra charges on the sset respectively .",
    "however , the incoherent tunneling of quasiparticles through the right - hand lead takes the sset island to the state @xmath11 , with a single extra charge , and then back to the state @xmath9 , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ schematic](b ) .",
    "the coupling of a resonator to the sset island allows for energy exchange between resonator and sset .",
    "depending on the sign of the detuning from the jqp resonance , the resonator is either driven into states of self - sustaining oscillation  @xcite , or experiences a cooling effect  @xcite because of its coupling to the sset .    in the open - system model , the coherent oscillations of cooper pairs across the left - hand josephson junction , the motion of the resonator and the coupling of the resonator position to the charge on the sset island",
    "are all included in an effective hamiltonian . while the resonator may be a stripline resonator  @xcite or a nanomechanical beam  @xcite , for clarity we will stick to language more appropriate for a mechanical oscillator .",
    "both the dissipative effects of the environment on the resonator and the decay of quasiparticles from the sset island and the right - hand lead can be described by lindblad operators such that the dynamics of the sset - resonator system may be found from a master equation  @xcite .",

    "the resonator is also capacitively coupled to the sset island .",

    "the full hamiltonian for the coherent dynamics is then  @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 the difference in electrostatic energy between states @xmath9 and @xmath10 is given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the josephson energy of the junctions .",

    "a characteristic of this system is the ability of the sset to drive  @xcite or cool  @xcite the resonator depending on the sign of @xmath14 , which is set by the detuning of the sset bias point from the jqp resonance .",
    "when @xmath34 , the sset can drive the resonator into different steady states as the sset - resonator coupling strength is increased .",
    "when decoupled from the sset , the resonator remains in its ground state . upon increasing the coupling , a continuous crossover",
