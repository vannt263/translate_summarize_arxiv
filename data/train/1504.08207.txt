    "<S> pacs numbers : :    74.25.fg , 75.30.fv , 73.43.-f , 74.20.mn    in last few years , a new field in condensed matter systems has emerged which is called `` topological insulators and superconductors''@xcite . it is based on the realization that the spin - orbit interaction in materials can lead to such electronic phases@xcite which has been observed in real materials@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a topological insulator , similar to an ordinary insulator has a bulk energy gap separating the highest occupied electronic band from the lowest empty band@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is closely related to the two - dimensional integer quantum hall states@xcite which have unique edge states . </S>",
    "<S> the surface of such insulators however , necessarily has gapless states ( edge states ) that are protected by time reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> these states are conducting with properties unlike any other known one - dimensional or two - dimensional electronic systems . </S>",
    "<S> these states are predicted to have special properties which are thought to be useful for applications ranging from spintronics to quantum computation@xcite . due to such technological importance </S>",
    "<S> the field of topological systems has grown rapidly over the years . </S>",
    "<S> since one of the compelling criteria of a material to be topological is that the system ought to have an energy gap , the topological concept extends over to any gapped systems such as superconductors and superfluids etc.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a possibility of a topological phase in the coexistence phase of superconductivity and spin - density wave has been discussed@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of such topological phase depends on the symmetry as well as the amplitudes of both the order parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the photoemission and the scanning tunneling spectroscopy have become an important experimental tool in identifying the surface states in topological systems but the signature of such states in transport measurements is still under debate . </S>",
    "<S> the focus of experimental studies thus has shifted to the separation of bulk conduction from the surface conduction . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there is an attempt to formulate the thermoelectric transport in topologial insulators theoretically@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thermoelectric transport is basically conversion of heat to energy . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of such energy conversion depends on the `` figure of merit '' of the material which is defined as , @xmath2@xcite , where @xmath3 is the temperature , @xmath4 is the seebeck coefficient and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the electrical and thermal conductivities . in order to achieve a high @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> the system should be a good electronic conductor whereas a bad lattice conductor . </S>",
    "<S> further , the material low - dimensionality also have large @xmath4 and have high efficiency due to their peaked density of states@xcite . despite such proposals it was very hard to discover good thermoelectric materials in the past . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 cannoot be independently controlled , namely , a material with large electrical conductivity @xmath5 has large thermal conductivity @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of topological systems gives some hope on the above issues due to the fact that the edge state conduction remains good whereas the phonon conduction is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the edge states are one - dimensional which satisfies the low dimensionality@xcite criteria mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> the topological phenomena which has already been observed in materials such as @xmath8@xcite , @xmath9@xcite and @xmath10@xcite are known as good thermoelectric materials .    in this communication </S>",
    "<S> , we study the thermoelectric transport in two - dimensional topological system which has coexistence of superconductivity(sc ) and spin - density wave(sdw ) . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry of sc is considered to be of @xmath11 type whereas the sdw order parameter is of @xmath1 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian having such a structure is shown to have topological coexistence phases in addition to the conventional one . the thermoelectric transport in such topological system </S>",
    "<S> is discussed with respect to two distinct contributions : ( i ) the surface and ( ii ) the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the competition among the surface versus the bulk transport is analyzed in different parameter regimes and the possibility of enhancement of figure of merit is discussed in these systems .    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we consider the coexistence of sdw and d - wave superconductivity which can generate a triplet and non - zero center of mass superconducting order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we , thus start with a hamiltonian on a @xmath12d square lattice@xcite as ,    @xmath13    here , @xmath14 is the bare dispersion due to the tight binding approximation on a 2d square lattice , @xmath15 is the on - site coulomb interaction , @xmath16 are the pairing strengths for @xmath17-wave and @xmath18-wave superconductivity and @xmath19 is the number of sites . also , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) denotes creation ( annihilation ) operator of the electron with spin @xmath23 at @xmath24 . here , @xmath25 is the sum of @xmath26 over the reduced brillouin zone ( rbz ) . </S>",
    "<S> we express the wave - vector @xmath26 in units of @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the lattice parameter of the underlying square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 is the sdw nesting vector in 2d . </S>",
    "<S> we assume here a commensurate sdw so that @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the staggered spin magnetization is defined as @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> since the discussion would be about three order parameters below , the crystal symmetry are such that the commutator of any two of them should give the third one . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if @xmath32 is assumed to be of singlet d - wave symmetry , the sdw state guarantees that @xmath33 should be of triplet type . </S>",
    "<S> so we get the singlet interaction @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> we further assume that @xmath38 are attractive . </S>",
    "<S> the sc order parameters are defined as , for singlet state , @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the triplet order is @xmath40 while @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> defining @xmath42 and @xmath43 and employing the nesting property in the band dispersion i.e. @xmath44 , @xmath45 and also the order parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the hamiltonian in the momentum space can be expressed as , @xmath48 where the four - component spinor @xmath49 is , @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the hamiltonian matrix @xmath51 in this basis is written as , + @xmath52    in what follows , we study the energy spectrum of the above hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian ( eqn.(3 ) ) is diagonalized and the quasiparticle spectrum is obtained as ,    @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> , corresponding to coexistence of sc order parameters @xmath54 and that of the sdw order parameter showing fully gapped spectrum . for illustration , here , </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , ( @xmath58 ev ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that the energy spectrum is fully gapped as shown in fig . 1 and the gap closes only when the rhs of the above equation vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> a straight forward calculation provides a condition where the gap closes at points @xmath59 and @xmath60 is    @xmath61    thus , one can find a topologically trivial and non - trivial regions with respect to these parameters . since the critical phase lines(for @xmath62 ) </S>",
    "<S> are determined by the condition @xmath63 the phase becomes topological in the region where @xmath64 whereas it is trivial for @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the details of these work have been discussed in a recent paper@xcite .    in order to study thermoelectric transport in these system , </S>",
    "<S> we consider a 2-d sample as a ribbon geometry where the ribbon width is taken to be very narrow . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the edge states can have comparable contribution as compared with the bulk . using a linear response theory@xcite , the electric current @xmath66 and thermal current @xmath67 which are coupled , </S>",
    "<S> are written as    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the electron charge @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the chemical potential . here , </S>",
    "<S> the field used are the electric field and the thermal gradient . </S>",
    "<S> the electric and thermal transport coefficients are obtained as ,    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the electron thermal conductivitiy and @xmath74 is phonon thermal conductivity . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath75 s are the correlation functions determing the thermoelectric transport coefficients .    since the topological systems have distinct edge and bulk states , we consider the transport due to both independently . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the edge transport only . </S>",
    "<S> to describe the coherent transport of the edge states , we use the landauer formula . </S>",
    "<S> the edge states are assumed to be perfectly conducting and the transmission coefficient @xmath76 is taken as unity . </S>",
    "<S> this is true when the electron energy is within the bulk gap ( @xmath77 ) , @xmath78 being the effective gap . </S>",
    "<S> the energy here is measured from the bottom of the conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> while carrying out the calculation of the transport coefficients , we consider the bottom of the bulk conduction band and neglect the valence band such that we deal only with the edge states . </S>",
    "<S> we further , restrict the chemical potential @xmath71 to be within the gap . </S>",
    "<S> the edge state correlation fuction @xmath75 is given by    @xmath79    where the suffix @xmath80 means the edge transport , @xmath81 is the planck constant and @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively are the length and the cross - section of the sample , the factor 2 comes from the two gapless channels of the 2d system . the integral in the above correlation function can be rewritten in a dimensionless form as    @xmath84    where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , @xmath3 being the temperature . using this edge - state correlation functions the thermoelectric coefficients are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> it is noticed that the edge contribution to the thermoelectric coefficients such as the figure of merit ( zt ) is independent of the system size @xmath82 and @xmath83 eventhough the edge correlation functions are directly proportional to @xmath82 and inversely proprtional to the cross - sectional area @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> further , zt is unusually large and exceeds unity when the chemical potential is in the bulk band . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that when @xmath71 is in the bulk band , the correlation functions @xmath89 has only exponential dependence on @xmath71 but @xmath90 and @xmath91 have combined exponential and algebraic dependence . on the contrary , when the chemical potential is in the bulk gap , zt becomes exponentially small ( @xmath92 ) which is in agreement with the figures ( see fig . 2 and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we consider the bulk thermoelectric transport . the bulk transport </S>",
    "<S> are calculated using the boltzmann transport theory . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the relaxation time @xmath93 is constant . since these transports are valid within the inelastic scattering length , we regard the inelastic scattering length as the effective system size . </S>",
    "<S> we use only the upper two subbands because there is a large gap between the upper and lower subbands due to the narrow - ribbon confinement . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk correlation function @xmath94 is written as    @xmath95    where the suffix @xmath96 means the bulk transport and @xmath97 is the relaxation time which is assumed to be constant . </S>",
    "<S> also @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively are the bulk dos and the velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the above integral can be changed to integral over the momentum variables as    @xmath100    using dimensionless variables namely @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the above equation is written as    @xmath103    the variable @xmath104 in the above equations is written as , @xmath105 which is functions of @xmath106 and @xmath107 . using the parameters in the energy dispersion , the above correlation functions are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that all the bulk correlations @xmath94 behave algebraically when the chemical potential is in the bulk band whereas they have combinations of algebraic and exponential dependence when @xmath71 is in the bulk gap . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the figure of merit is larger when the chemical potential is away from the band edge .    </S>",
    "<S> since the actual thermoelectric transport coefficients involve both the edge and bulk correlation functions , we use @xmath108 and compute the transport properties . </S>",
    "<S> it has already been mentioned in the earlier section that the thermoelectric transports in the topological systems are due to the competition between the edge and the bulk contributions . as has already been discussed above , the relative magnitudes of both the edge and the bulk transports for different chemical potentials are different </S>",
    "<S> , the figure of merit zt is also different . </S>",
    "<S> when the chemical potential is in the bulk band , zt from the edge becomes larger eventhogh the number of edge carriers are exponentially small . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that that the edge transport is overridden by the bulk contributions and a high zt from the edge never appears . in a similar way </S>",
    "<S> , zt from the bulk becomes larger when the chemical potential is in the bulk gap . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , there are very few bulk carriers whereas there are some edge carriers for which the edge carriers dominate and hence zt is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> this is a clear indication that in topological system the edge and the bulk transport compete with each other suppressing the total zt . </S>",
    "<S> + in order to compute the transport properties , we consider the following parameters : the hopping integral is taken to be zero and the next nearest neighbour hopping integral as @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> the sc and sdw order parameters respectively are considered to be @xmath110 , @xmath56 where the parameter @xmath111 taken to be @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> the computation is performed at a temperature @xmath113 . the relaxation time is taken to be @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon thermal conductivity is taken to be constant which is @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective system size @xmath82 is assumed to be @xmath116 and the cross - sectional area @xmath83 is taken as @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> all these parameters are taken in an adhoc basis and the thermoelectric coefficients are computed . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious from fig . 2 and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 that the edge contribution to @xmath5 , @xmath73 and @xmath7 is much higher as compared to the bulk . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , the seebeck coefficient has comparable contribution from both , a positive contribution from edge whereas a negative contribution from bulk . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there is a partial cancellation due to opposite charge carriers in the edge and the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> this results a peak structure in the seebeck coefficient near the band edge which makes the figure of merit large .    due to the edge - bulk competition </S>",
    "<S> , there is a possibility that zt could be maximum when the chemical potential is near the band edge . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , the bulk conduction is dominant at high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> on lowering temperature , the bulk - edge cross - over takes place and there is a possibility that zt might be higher as shown in fig.2 and fig.3 . </S>",
    "<S> the edge current in these system provides ballistic transport but such transport crucially depends on the inelastic scattering length @xmath82 of the edge states because they loose their coherence due to inelastic scattering . at high temperature </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath82 is short and the bulk transport is dominant but at low temperature , @xmath82 is long and the edge transport is dominant </S>",
    "<S> . this might be the reason why an enhanced figure of merit results at low temperature .    in conclusion , we summarize the main findings of the present work . </S>",
    "<S> we study the thermoelectric transport in a two - dimensional topological system which has coexistence of superconductivity(sc ) and spin - density wave(sdw ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sc is presumed to be of @xmath11 type whereas the sdw order parameter is of @xmath1 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian having such a structure is shown to have topological coexistence phases in addition to the conventional one . </S>",
    "<S> the thermoelectric transport in such topological system is discussed with respect to two distinct contributions : ( i ) the surface and ( ii ) the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the competetion among the surface versus the bulk transport is analyzed in different parameter regimes and the possibility of enhancement of figure of merit is discussed in these systems . </S>"
