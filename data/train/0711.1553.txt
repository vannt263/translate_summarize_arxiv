    "the _ cosmic background explorer _ ( _ cobe _ ) revealed that the extragalactic background light at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths was comparable to that at optical wavelengths indicating that half of the star formation and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) emission , averaged over cosmic time , is obscured by dust ( e.g.  puget et al .  1996 ; hauser & dwek 2001 ) . in the local universe ,",
    "the volume density of dusty , infrared luminous galaxies is insufficient to account for this background .",
    "therefore the density of such galaxies must evolve strongly with redshift ( e.g.  see lagache , puget , & dole 2005 for a review ) .",
    "in fact , imaging observations with the _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ) and the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( hereafter _ spitzer _ ) have shown that about 70% of the comoving star formation rate density ( sfrd ) at @xmath7 is obscured by dust ( chary & elbaz 2001 ; lefloch et al .",
    "2005 ; prez - gonzlez et al .  2005 ) .    in the local universe ,",
    "we refer to these dusty galaxies as luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , @xmath8)<12 $ ] ) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , @xmath9 ) \\ge 12 $ ] ) where @xmath10 is the total ir luminosity from 81000@xmath11 m ( see sanders & mirabel 1996 for a review ) .",
    "it is now becoming clear that ir luminous galaxies are a heterogenous population with selection functions at different mid- and far - infrared wavelengths revealing different subsets of this population ( daddi et al .",
    "2005 ; lutz et al .  2005b",
    "; yan et al .  2005 ; pope et al .  2006 ) .",
    "perhaps the most enigmatic members of the high redshift ulirg population are the submillimeter ( submm ) galaxies ( smgs ) .",
    "these galaxies were initially discovered in the late 1990s with the submillimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba , holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) and then later with max - planck millimetre bolometer ( mambo ) camera on the institut de radio astronomie millimetrique ( iram ) 30-m telescope ( see blain et al .",
    "2002 for a review ) .",
    "they have proven to be difficult to study , due to the large beam size of submm observations and the difficulty in finding counterparts at other wavelengths ( e.g.  ivison et al .",
    "2002 ; pope et al .",
    "nevertheless , it has been found that they are very massive systems ( swinbank et al .",
    "2004 ; borys et al .",
    "2005 ; greve et al .  2005 ; tacconi et al .",
    "2006 ) at @xmath2 ( chapman et al .  2005 ; pope et al .  2006",
    "; aretxaga et al .  2007 ) which are thought to be connected to the most massive present day galaxies via an evolutionary sequence ( lilly et al .",
    "a crucial aspect that needs to be explored in smgs is what powers their extreme luminosities : agn activity or star formation ?",
    "the mid - ir spectral regime is a particularly good probe of what is producing the total infrared luminosity since it has contributions from both star - formation and agn each with a unique signature at these wavelengths .",
    "the 515@xmath11 m mid - ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can be decomposed into 3 main components ( e.g.  sajina et al .",
    "2007 ) : ( 1 ) emission features from what are thought to be polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules ( puget & leger 1989 ; allamandola et al .",
    "1999 ) ; ( 2 ) power - law ( or warm blackbody ) emission ; and ( 3 ) extinction characterized by prominent silicate absorption features ( e.g.  draine 2003 ) .",
    "the first is understood to be powered entirely by star formation while the second is predominantly emission from the agn ( genzel et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the second component can also contain contributions from hot dust ( very small grains ) present in the most energetic hii regions ( e.g.  tran et al .",
    "2001 ) . the third component can be found in both starbursts and agn since it just requires a dust screen around hot dust emission .",
    "measuring the contribution from ulirgs to the global star formation rate requires dissecting their ir emission into contributions from starbursts and agn .",
    "mid - ir spectroscopy with _",
    "iso _ made it possible to decompose the various contributors in local ulirgs with the result that they are predominantly starburst powered , although they also show signs of agn activity ( e.g.  genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; lutz et al .  1999",
    "; rigopoulou et al .  1999 ; sturm et al .  2000 ; tran et al .",
    "in particular , _ iso _ studies of local ulirgs showed that at low luminosities , the ulirgs are powered mainly by a starburst but at the very highest luminosities ( @xmath12 ) , the dominant emission source is the agn ( lutz et al .",
    "1998 ; tran et al .  2001 ) . from this",
    "one might expect that smgs , with their extreme ir luminosities ( @xmath13 , pope et al .",
    "2006 ) , are primarily agn - dominated .",
    "the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ; houck et al .",
    "2004 ) , with its sensitivity and spectral resolution , can extend this effort outside the local universe , allowing much larger samples to be observed to much fainter flux limits .",
    "the irs can detect emission features and continuum in ulirgs out to @xmath14 ( valiante et al .",
    "the 3 mid - ir spectral components listed above have been fit to the _ spitzer _ irs spectra of ulirgs at various redshifts to determine the agn contribution to the mid - ir luminosity ( e.g.  sajina et al .",
    "although x - ray imaging is very effective at identifying the presence of an agn in a galaxy , it is subject to obscuration in extreme , compton - thick sources .",
    "the x - ray luminosity provides a direct measurement of the power of the agn at x - ray energies but it is necessary to make assumptions about the geometry of the obscuring dust to determine the bolometric luminosity of the agn ( e.g.  alexander et al .",

    "2004 ; chapman et al .",

    "spitzer _ at these wavelengths and therefore they can be treated as point sources .    at mid - ir wavelengths , the dominant source of noise is the sky background , mostly from zodiacal light .",
    "since we have long integrations of very faint targets , additional data reduction steps are required to alleviate the detector and sky noise .",

    "there are a number of hot pixels in the irs arrays ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "rogue pixel masks were created from the campaign masks and from examining each 2d spectral image individually .",
    "we used irsclean[multiblock footnote omitted ] to replace the values of the hot pixels by extrapolating from the surrounding pixels .",

    "we explore several methods for removing the sky background including : a ) subtracting the average spectrum at each nod position ; b ) subtracting individual observations from opposite nod positions and then averaging ; c ) subtracting a ` supersky ' created from all files from that astronomical observation request ( aor ) ; and d ) subtracting a supersky created from all our data taken in a given campaign . in all methods , we mask out all sources which fall within the irs slit identified from the deep 24@xmath1 m imaging of the goods",

    "the supersky subtraction was carried out with and without normalizing to the median in each image .",
    "the third method of subtracting a normalized supersky created from all observations from that aor gave the lowest residual sky noise ( and thus highest snr ) in the final spectrum therefore this is what we used to remove the sky from all our observations .    after the sky was removed from the individual data files , we then coadded them using a clipped median .",
    "the coadds were checked again for persisting hot pixels and cleaned once more using irsclean .",
    "these steps produced two 2d spectra for each target , one for each nod position .",
    "we used the spitzer irs custom extraction ( spice[multiblock footnote omitted ] ) to extract the 1d spectra at each nod position .",
    "we used a narrow extraction window of 2 pixels ( @xmath3910 arcseconds for ll observations ) which was constant as a function of wavelength .",
    "we found this produced higher snr spectra than using an extraction window of increasing width , starting with 2 pixels at the blue end . using the optimal extraction option in spice",
    ", we found comparable results to the 2 pixel , fixed width , extraction .",
    "for each science spectrum , we also extracted a residual sky spectrum , offset from any sources , to provide a level of the error in our final spectrum as a function of wavelength .",
    "the uncertainty is calculated as the standard deviation of 10 pixels surrounding each wavelength in the residual sky spectrum . for each source , the 1d spectra at each nod position",
    "were then averaged together to produce the final spectrum for each source .",
    "further details about the final noise in our irs spectra are given in appendix  [ app : rms ] .    in order to calibrate the final irs spectra , we reduced standard star calibrator observations from the same campaign as our observations , in exactly the same way that we reduced the science observations .",
    "we then extracted the spectrum for the calibrator using our 2 pixel width and the default spice width in order to determine the calibration factor as a function of wavelength .",
    "this calibration was verified against the broad - band photometry at 8 , 16 and 24@xmath11 m and we found very good agreement ( see fig .",

    "2004 ) . for each of the 4 main pah lines ( 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.3@xmath11 m ) , we isolated a region around each line and simultaneously fit the line and continuum .",
    "both the center and the width of the line were allowed to vary .",
    "all measured line widths were consistent within the errors with the line widths measured in irs spectra of local star forming galaxies ( smith et al .",

    "all smg line measurements used in this paper including 3@xmath40 upper limits when the line is undetected in the irs spectrum are listed in table [ tab : lines ] .",
    "the biggest uncertainty in comparing pah line luminosities from different samples comes from differences in how the spectral lines are measured , more specifically , how the continuum is estimated for each line .",
    "this can lead to variations in the line flux and equivalent width of up to a factor of 4 ( see sajina et al .  2007",

    "our method of measuring the line strengths gives similar results to the cubic spline continuum fits performed in brandl et al .",
    "( 2006 , see next paragraph ) .",

    "2007 ; smith et al .  2007 ) since the continuum we adopt is higher .",
    "therefore , we took care to measure the pah lines in any comparison samples in the exact same way as we did for the smgs .    in this paper , we compare the smg pah line luminosities to those of other galaxy populations .",

    "note that c1 does not stick out as an outlier in these plots , since we have removed the agn component of its @xmath10 .",
    "the second thing which stands out in fig .",
    "[ fig : lir ] is that there is significant scatter in this relation for both the low redshift starbursts and the high redshift smgs . in the smaller panels",
    "the two larger colored error bars quantify the @xmath84 scatter seen in the starbursts and smgs .",
    "the scatter is similar for the smgs and starbursts and is considerably higher than would be implied by the measurement uncertainty .",

    "are likely playing a role in this scatter .",

[ fig : lir ] .",
    "the kennicutt ( 1998 ) relation between @xmath10 and sfr assumes a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function and applies to starbursts with ages less than @xmath99myr . assuming that both the pah and far - ir emission are tracing the star formation",
    ", we can use the kennicutt ( 1998 ) relation and the above pah line luminosity to @xmath10 correlations to determine the relation between sfr and the pah line luminosity .",
    "we use the 6.2@xmath11 m pah line since it is the least affected by the silicate absorption and line blending .",

    "[ equ : lir ] .",
    "we have shown from the mid - ir spectra of high redshift smgs that these systems are starburst - dominated and contain only a small contribution from the agn . despite , the fact that x - ray observations suggest that most smgs harbor an agn , only a small fraction of smgs ( 2/13 ) contain an agn which contributes significantly to the mid - ir luminosity . when extrapolated to the total ir luminosity ,",
    "all smgs are dominated ( @xmath72 of @xmath10 ) by star formation and not agn activity .    from table [ tab : lines ] we see that the median @xmath96 for our sample is @xmath101 , which corresponds to a sfr of around @xmath102 .",
    "this is an extremely high rate of star formation , capable of creating a massive @xmath103 galaxy in only @xmath104years .",
    "coupled with the low number density of smgs compared to other massive galaxies at high redshift , this leads us to suspect that smgs are a short - lived phase in the evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "smgs are only one of several populations of high redshift galaxies which are ultraluminous in the infrared .",
    "many @xmath2 galaxies selected in deep 24@xmath11 m surveys also qualify as ulirgs ( e.g.  daddi et al .",
    "2005 ; yan et al .  2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "these other ulirgs are generally not detected at submm wavelengths .",
    "what then are the fundamental differences between various populations of high redshift ulirgs ?    one of the main factors which could cause a bifurcation in the population of ulirgs at high redshift is the presence or absence of a bolometrically significant agn .",
    "the evolutionary scenario proposed by sanders et al .",
    "( 1988 ) shows massive galaxies going through several main stages en route to becoming a massive elliptical .",
    "it starts with an ir luminous phase most likely triggered by a massive merger . during this stage of intense star formation",
    ", the agn is also growing .",
    "as the agn becomes larger it begins to feedback on the galaxy , eventually quenching the star formation completely by blowing off all the dust and gas .",
    "thus begins the qso phase , where the agn is free to dominate the emission .",
    "eventually the qso consumes its gas and we end up with a quiescent massive elliptical galaxy . in this scenario ,",
    "the submm emission will be at a maximum during the initial ir luminous phase ( springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ) . however , one uncertainty in this scenario is the timescale . in particular , how long is the ir luminous phase and how long does it take the agn to develop ?    since most ulirgs at @xmath2 show a mix of agn and starburst activity ( e.g.  houck et al .",
    "2005 ; sajina et al .",
    "2007 ) they fit into this evolutionary scenario at the stage where the agn has developed but before it has had a chance to expel all the gas and dust , since the ir luminosities are high . since smgs show less of an agn contribution , it is likely that they represent a slightly earlier phase of this scenario , before the agn has time to develop fully and is significant to the ir luminosity .",
    "this is also consistent with the finding that smgs have cool dust temperatures ( pope et al .",
    "2006 ) , partly because the star - formation is taking place on extended spatial scales and partly because the agn is not yet energetically important for heating the dust .",
    "other high redshift ulirgs , like those selected at 24@xmath11 m ( e.g.  sajina et al .",
    "2007 ) , should have warmer dust temperatures ( or have overestimated infrared luminosities ) , otherwise they would be detected in the submm .",
    "therefore , they likely represent the stage after the smg phase in this evolutionary scenario .    for local ulirgs , there is evidence which shows that the luminosity of co emission decreases as the merger progresses ( rigopoulou et al .",
    "1999 ) , which is consistent with decreasing submm emission in the later stages of the merger .",
    "this idea is also consistent with morphological studies which show that smgs are often tidally disrupted systems ( chapman et al .",
    "2003 ; conselice et al .  2003 ; pope et al .  2005 ) . alternatively ,",
    "smgs and other high redshift ulirgs might appear different because of different merger progenitors .",
    "since the number density of smgs is much less than that of all 24@xmath11 m selected ir - luminous galaxies , then this phase in the evolutionary sequence must be shorter .",
    "we can make a rough estimate for the duration of the submm luminous phase . in the 2@xmath26gyrs between @xmath105",
    "there are roughly 20 smgs and 500 24@xmath11m - selected galaxies ( with @xmath106 , see chary et al .",
    "2004 ) within a portion of the goods",
    "- n field .",
    "assuming that all ir - luminous 24@xmath11m - selected galaxies will undergo a submm luminous stage during this period of time , we calculate the duration of the submm luminous phase to be on the order of @xmath104yrsm - selected galaxies will undergo a submm - luminous phase since smgs are known to be massive and could represent only the most extreme galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , this calculation provides a useful reality check on the expected duration of the smg phase . ] . as mentioned above",
    ", this timescale is what is needed to create a galaxy with a stellar mass of @xmath107 ( borys et al .",
    "2005 ) at a rate of @xmath108 .",
    "this timescale is consistent with those derived from gas masses of smgs ( greve et al .",
    "_ spitzer _ irs spectroscopy has been obtained for a sample of 13 smgs brighter than 200@xmath11jy at 24@xmath11 m .",
    "this has effectively confirmed the identification of these smg counterparts , and in some cases has provided a new redshift estimate .",
    "the smgs show strong pah emission and , on average , only a small continuum contribution from hot dust .",
    "we have explored several diagnostics from the mid - ir spectra of smgs to determine the level of agn contributing to the luminosity at these wavelengths .",
    "all of them seem to converge on a picture in which smgs are starburst - dominated systems with at most a 30% contribution from an agn at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "their mid - ir spectra are similar to a scaled spectrum of local starburst galaxies like m82 .",
    "the classification of an smg as agn or starburst - dominated from the mid - ir often disagrees with the classification from the x - rays . while x - ray observations are better suited for determining the presence of an agn in an smg , the mid - ir spectra can determine how important the agn is to the total infrared luminosity since it is directly detecting the hot dust emission and not subject to details about the geometry of the obscuring material .",
    "full ir sed fits to the mid - ir data , far - infrared and radio photometry show that smgs are best - fit by scaled up versions of local ir - luminous galaxy templates with additional extinction from the draine ( 2003 ) extinction curves .",
    "these models have cool dust temperatures ( @xmath109k ) and high @xmath10s which imply sfrs of @xmath110 assuming a salpeter initial mass function .",
    "smgs lie on the local relation between @xmath10 and @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) , which means that the pah line flux can be used to estimate the sfrs in these systems , albeit with large uncertainties .",
    "equivalent widths , which have been the focus of some other studies , are much less useful in this regard .",
    "smgs appear to be an earlier phase in the evolution of massive galaxies than other high redshift ulirgs .",
    "the average high redshift ulirg shows warmer dust and less pah emission .",
    "it is therefore likely that the agn in smgs has not yet grown strong enough to heat the dust substantially and destroy the pah molecules .",
    "we have been able to put constraints on the contribution from agn activity to the restframe 512@xmath11 m mid - ir emission , and have extrapolated this to far - ir wavelengths . without more data from 30100@xmath11",
    "m rest frame it is difficult to directly probe the emission at far - ir wavelengths .",

    "one further smg deserves special discussion and that is gn39 .",

    "both are confirmed to lie at @xmath117 ( swinbank et al .",
    "2004 ; chapman et al .",
    "2005 ) , therefore it is likely that they are both contributing to the submm emission .",
    "the separation corresponds to 70 kpc at this redshift .",
    "our irs observations picked up both counterparts and , with a narrow extraction window , we were able to extract a separate spectrum of each component .",
    "some of the flux from gn39a falls into the spectral extraction window of gn39b however a comparison of the 24@xmath11 m flux from the irs spectra to that from the mips 24@xmath11 m image confirms that only 1/3 of the flux in the irs spectrum of gn39b is from gn39a .",
    "the extracted spectra confirm that these two sources are indeed at the same redshift and both spectra look very similar to each other and to the rest of the smgs , supporting the idea that they are both submm emitters .",
    "furthermore , both components are x - ray detected and classified as obscured agn by alexander et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , although the two irs spectra show a completely starburst - dominated system at mid - ir wavelengths .    since these two smgs are at the same redshift , we know that they must be associated .",
    "given the physical distance between them , larger than those seen in most local ulirgs ( murphy et al .",
    "1996 ) , we could be seeing the early stage in the merger of two massive galaxies ( springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ) .",
    "note that gn04 , gn07 and gn19 also have double radio counterparts , which are thought to be at the same redshift .",
    "however , in these sources , the two components are separated by only 3 arcseconds and therefore they do not resolve into two separate 24@xmath11 m sources .",
