    "the half - metallic properties of la@xmath0sr@xmath8mno@xmath9 ( x=0.3 ) ( lsmo ) are of great importance for applications in spintronics .",
    "the tunnel magnetoresistance junction of lsmo / srtio@xmath2/lsmo shows magnetoresistance ratio in excess of 1800% @xcite .",
    "this result , according to ref . , strongly underlines the half - metallic nature of mixed - valence manganites .",
    "the electronic properties of lsmo , as described by band theory , are nearly half - metallic @xcite , reflecting the so - called transport half - metallic behaviour.@xcite however the fascinating electronic and magnetic properties of lsmo , including colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) , indicate that the electronic structure is more complex than the standard band theory picture ( see reviews @xcite ) . in particular , the electronic structure",
    "is determined by the competition of double exchange and superexchange interactions , charge / orbital ordering instabilities , and strong coupling to the lattice deformations .",
    "local jahn - teller effects , such as random jahn - teller distortions of the mno@xmath6 @xcite octahedra , as well as dynamical effects @xcite , have recently been invoked to explain the magnetoconductivity and optical conductivity respectively . despite the numerous studies of the phase diagram of lamno@xmath2-srmno@xmath2 ( lmo - smo ) ( such as in refs . ) , there are still many conflicting interpretations of the role of the jahn - teller effect in this material @xcite , localisation of _ d _ electrons , @xcite and polarisation of electrons at the fermi level.@xcite    in this paper we discuss issues concerning the charge ordering , and more specifically , the distribution of mn@xmath4 and mn@xmath5 in lsmo .",
    "we use the first principles self - interaction corrected local spin density ( sic - lsd ) approximation.@xcite this method can determine the number of valence band states .",
    "hence , it can differentiate between mn contributing three states ( mn@xmath4 ) to the valence band with the remaining four mn states ( 3@xmath10 and 1@xmath11 ) localised well below the valence band , and mn contributing four states ( mn@xmath5 ) to the valence band , with the remaining three mn states ( 3@xmath10 ) localised below the valence band .",
    "this method was successfully applied to the study of orbital order in lamno@xmath2.@xcite    calculations with the sic - lsd as a function of sr doping are presented in this paper for la@xmath12sr@xmath8mno@xmath9 where 0.0@xmath13x@xmath130.5 .",
    "the sr doping is modeled with supercells and also with the rigid band approach . in particular we",
    "will be concerned with determining the mn valency as a function of concentration x. it is found , as expected , that the valency changes as a function of sr doping from mn@xmath4 to mn@xmath5 . however , a mixed phase of mn@xmath4 and mn@xmath5 valencies is found to accompany the valency change .",
    "the mn@xmath4/mn@xmath5 ordering in this mixed phase is consistent with charge ordered stripes .",
    "furthermore it is found that , in the mn@xmath5 state and as a function of sr doping , a change of magnetic structure from ferromagnetic to anti - ferromagnetic takes place . to highlight the effects of sr doping on the mn",
    "valencies the lattice parameters are kept constant for all concentrations of sr doping .",
    "however , a slightly larger lattice parameter makes the mn@xmath4 valency less unfavourable .",
    "the structural properties of lsmo show an equally rich variety of charge ordered states . elongating the mno@xmath14 octahedron",
    "makes it for the mn ion more likely to take on the mn@xmath4 valency .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the theoretical background of our electronic structure calculations , and in particular , the self - interaction corrected local spin density method . the technical and computational details regarding the application of the sic - lsd to lsmo are discussed in section iii . in section iv , we verify that the method works separately for lamno@xmath2 and srmno@xmath2 .",
    "section v discusses the correlation between magnetic structure and charge order in lsmo .",
    "the influence of oxygen displacements on the charge order is investigated in section vi .",
    "section vii presents the results of calculations for various realizations of phase separation and their influence on the charge order .",
    "the conclusions of the paper are summarized in section viii .",
    "the basis of the sic - lsd formalism is a self - interaction free total energy functional , @xmath15 , obtained by subtracting from the lsd total energy functional , @xmath16 , a spurious self - interaction of each occupied electron state @xmath17@xcite , namely @xmath18 here @xmath19 numbers the occupied states and the self - interaction correction for the state @xmath19 is @xmath20+e_{xc}^{lsd}[\\bar{n}_{\\alpha } ] , \\ ] ] with @xmath21 $ ] being the hartree energy and @xmath22 $ ] the lsd exchange - correlation energy for the corresponding charge density @xmath23 and spin density @xmath24 .",
    "the sic - lsd approach can be viewed as an extension of lsd in the sense that the self - interaction correction is only finite for spatially localised states , while for bloch - like single - particle states @xmath15 is equal to @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the lsd minimum is also a local minimum of @xmath15 .",
    "a question now arises , whether there exist other competitive minima , corresponding to a finite number of localised states , which could benefit from the self - interaction term without loosing too much of the energy associated with band formation .",
    "this is often the case for rather well localised electrons like the 3@xmath25 electrons in transition metal oxides or the 4@xmath26 electrons in rare earth compounds .",
    "it follows from minimisation of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) that within the sic - lsd approach such localised electrons move in a different potential than the delocalized valence electrons which respond to the effective lsd potential .",
    "for example , in the case of manganese , three ( mn@xmath5 ) or four ( mn@xmath4 ) mn @xmath25 electrons move in the sic potential , while all other electrons feel only the effective lsd potential .",
    "thus , by including an explicit energy contribution for an electron to localise , the ab - initio sic - lsd describes both localised and delocalized electrons on an equal footing , leading to a greatly improved description of static coulomb correlation effects over the lsd approximation .    in order to make the connection between valence and localisation more explicit",
    "it is useful to define the nominal valence as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the atomic number ( 25 for mn ) , @xmath29 is the number of core ( and semi - core ) electrons ( 18 for mn ) , and @xmath30 is the number of localised , i.e. , self - interaction corrected , states ( either three or four for mn@xmath5 and mn@xmath4 respectively ) .",
    "thus , in this formulation the valence is equal to the integer number of electrons available for band formation . to find the valence we assume various atomic configurations , consisting of different numbers of localised states , and minimise the sic - lsd energy functional of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with respect to the number of localised electrons .",
    "the sic - lsd formalism is governed by the energetics due to the fact that for each orbital the sic differentiates between the energy gain due to hybridisation of an orbital with the valence bands and the energy gain upon its localisation . whichever wins determines if the orbital is part of the valence band or not and in this manner also leads to the evaluation of the valence of elements involved .",
    "the sic depends on the choice of orbitals and its value can differ substantially as a result of this . therefore , one has to be guided by the energetics in defining the most optimally localised orbitals to determine the absolute energy minimum of the sic - lsd energy functional .",
    "the advantage of the sic - lsd formalism is that for such systems as transition metal oxides or rare earth compounds the lowest energy solution will describe the situation where some single - electron states may not be bloch - like . for mn",
    ", these would be the mn 3@xmath25 states , but not the o 2@xmath31 states , as trying to localise the latter is energetically unfavourable .    in the present work the sic - lsd approach ,",
    "has been implemented @xcite within the linear muffin - tin - orbital ( lmto ) atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) band structure method , @xcite in the tight - binding representation @xcite .",
    "we performed sic - lsd calculations for both la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 for @xmath32 and smo .",
    "the space group symmetry of the lsmo structure changes , as a function of sr concentration , from @xmath33 ( 0% of the sr ) to @xmath34 ( between 10% and @xmath3550% of the sr ) and @xmath36 for smo .",
    "however , for the sake of comparison , we performed calculations using the same cubic crystal structure for all the concentrations . thus our results for lmo refer to a hypothetical cubic phase . in order to highlight the effect of the electron doping by substituting sr for la we also kept the lattice parameter constant at 7.32 atomic units ( a.u . ) - which is the average of the theoretical lattice parameters of ferromagnetic lmo and smo .",
    "the experimental lattice parameter , in going from lmo to smo , changes by 1% , i.e. , from 7.45 to 7.38 a.u ..    for the linear muffin - tin basis functions , we used 6_s _ , 5_p _ , 5_d _ partial waves for the la and 5_s _ , 4_p _ , 4_d _ for the sr atoms , and treated them as low - waves.@xcite including also 4_f_-basis functions on the lanthanum , treated as intermediate waves , was of no substantial importance for the final results .",
    "on the manganese atoms only 4_s _ and 3_d _ partial waves were treated as low waves , whilst the 4_p_-waves were treated as intermediate . on the oxygen only 2_s _ and 2_p _ partial waves were treated as low - waves , and 3_d_-waves as intermediate . the atomic sphere radii were 4.0 , 2.3 and 1.8 a.u .",
    "for the lanthanum and strontium , manganese and oxygen , respectively .",
    "these spheres were chosen to minimise the discontinuity in the hartree potentials , giving an overlap volume of approximately 8% .",
    "no empty spheres were used for the cubic system .",
    "care was taken to ensure that the results were converged with respect to both the size of the screening cluster and the number of * k * points for which the one electron equations were solved .",
    "this was imperative to allow comparisons to be made between different magnetic structures , which entailed the use of different unit cells .",
    "the screening clusters consisting of 111 atoms for the lanthanum , strontium and manganese sites and 99 atoms for the oxygen atoms were used .",
    "the number of * k * points used was 256 in the full brillouin zone for the paramagnetic / ferromagnetic , g - type and a - type magnetic structures .    to perform calculations for lsmo with @xmath37",
    ", we have utilized the sic - lsd within the rigid band model and supercell approach . in the rigid band model ,",
    "the variations in the band filling ( reduction by up to 0.5 electrons ) and lattice constant were the only variables depicting the change from the cubic lamno@xmath2 to lsmo .",
    "thus taking into consideration the dependence on the lattice constant , we could use the results from rigid band model to describe properties of other perovskites where sr may be replaced by ca or ba .",
    "supercells of the form la@xmath38sr@xmath39mn@xmath40o@xmath41 ( where @xmath42 and m=1,2,3 ) were constructed to describe charge ordering effects due to mn@xmath5 occurring in the vicinity of sr , and mn@xmath4 present around la sites .",
    "we start with the application of the sic - lsd to the end compounds of lsmo , namely lamno@xmath2 and srmno@xmath2 .",
    "table [ smotab ] summarizes the lsd and sic - lsd results for smo for three different magnetic structures , and two mn valence configurations . as seen in the table , the mn@xmath5 configuration in the g - type anti - ferromagnetic",
    "( af - g ) structure is the ground state solution .",
    "the latter is insulating , with a band gap of 1.08 ev , twice smaller than the measured band gap @xcite of 2.3 ev .",
    "the ground state configuration corresponds to the localization of the three @xmath10 electrons .",
    "localizing an extra @xmath25 electron , the @xmath11 one with the symmetry @xmath43 , giving rise to mn@xmath4 , is unfavourable by more than 100 mry , for all three different magnetic structures .",
    "this energy difference between mn@xmath5 and mn@xmath4 configurations in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) smo system decreases from 120 mry to 93 mry , when increasing the lattice parameter from 7.2 a.u .",
    "( corresponding to the theoretical pseudocubic fm ground state of smo with mn@xmath4 ) to 7.32 a.u .. on the other hand , table [ smotab ] also shows that only 5 mry separate the g - type from a - type antiferromagnetic state .",
    "this shows that the charge ordering energy in smo is a much larger energy scale than the magnetic order and that its dependence on the lattice constant is small .",
    "the charge transfer of 1.0@xmath44 and 0.1@xmath44 respectively from mn and o atoms to sr atom hardly changes for the three different magnetic structures .",
    "for each magnetic structure the localisation increases the mn magnetic moment , which , however does not change much between the different magnetic structures .",
    ".[smotab ] energy for different magnetic configurations for cubic srmno@xmath2 referred to the ground state energy .",
    "the energy differences are per chemical unit cell and the lattice parameter was taken to be 7.32 a.u .. the @xmath45 orbital is written as 1@xmath11 .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the la@xmath46sr@xmath7mn@xmath14o@xmath47 system , i.e. increasing the sr concentration to @xmath3530% , acquires the mn@xmath5 ground state configuration and is metallic .",
    "for this system we have studied the influence of the distribution of sro and lao layers on the total energy .",
    "the state with the lowest energy was attained by phase separating the sro layers from the lao layers , namely the two sro layers were nearest neighbors . separating the two sro layers by one and two lao layers , respectively , increases respectively the energy of the system by 2 and 5 mry .    in fig .",
    "[ fig ] , we show density of states ( dos ) of one of the configurations of la@xmath46sr@xmath7mn@xmath6o@xmath47 .",
    "the configuration is such that we have one mno@xmath7 plane with mn@xmath5 , sandwiched between two sro planes , and all other mno@xmath7 planes are occupied by mn@xmath4 .",
    "this supercell can be considered as a model of phase separated lsmo which was studied by koida.@xcite it is also of relevance to the la@xmath48ca@xmath49mno@xmath2 system investigated by bibes.@xcite as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig ] , this system lsmo is half - metallic .",
    "energetically unfavourable , however , the energy difference between this state and the ground state is reduced to 20 mry , in comparison with the energy difference between all mn having the mn@xmath4 configuration and the ground state ( 33 mry ) .",
    "the gap is reduced from 0.68 ev ( the scenario with the configuration of mn@xmath4 for all manganese atoms ) to 0.54 ev . note",
    "that this pseudogap is constant for all mno@xmath7 layers , independently of their valence .",
    "none of the supercells had this mn@xmath4 valence in their ground state configuration .",
    "however one could speculate that maybe at the surface mn@xmath4 could be the stable configuration since the lower coordination would favour the more localised state .",
    "more complex supercells , where more sr layers could phase separate , could plausibly lead to a half - metallic ground state .",
    "the magnetic moment increases from 2.82 @xmath50 for mn sandwiched between two sro planes ( denoted by mn@xmath51 to 2.99@xmath50 for mn@xmath52",
    "( mn sandwiched between two lao planes ) in the mn@xmath5 configured ground state and from 3.45@xmath50 for mn@xmath53 to 3.67@xmath50 for mn@xmath52 in the half - metallic mn@xmath4 configuration .",
    "we note that the magnetic moments on the oxygen atoms in the sro layers are dramatically reduced in the vicinity of mn@xmath4 , namely , a value of 0.01@xmath50 is obtained , and they have values of 0.15 and 0.2@xmath50 in the vicinity of mn@xmath4/mn@xmath5 and mn@xmath5 respectively .",
    "the magnetic moments of the o atoms residing in the lao plane remain small at 0.05@xmath50 independently of the mn valency .",
    "in contrast , the o magnetic moments in the mno@xmath54 planes are small with values around 0.05@xmath50 and do not change much depending on mn valency except for mn@xmath5 at the sro / lao interface were an o magnetic moment as large as 0.1@xmath50 has been calculated .    through the study of the la@xmath46sr@xmath46mn@xmath55o@xmath56 supercell we model an even further increase of the sr concentration to 50% .",
    "the geometry of the supercell is four la layers separated from the four sr layers . for this supercell",
    "the ground state configuration is all mn@xmath5 and this has 31 mry lower energy than the half - metallic system with mixed valence mn@xmath5/mn@xmath4 configuration ( 33333444 ) and 61 mry lower than the configuration with all mn@xmath4 .",
    "the magnetic moments , which are smaller than for 30% sr , are increasing , as is also the case for 30% sr , from 2.71 @xmath50 for mn@xmath53 to 3.05 @xmath50 for mn@xmath52 in the mn@xmath5 configured ground state , and from 3.56@xmath50 for mn@xmath53 to 3.61@xmath50 for mn@xmath52 in the half - metallic mn@xmath4 configuration .",
    "for the latter , more localised configuration , we note a large sensitivity of the magnetic moments of the oxygen atoms from the lao layers to the presence of the sro / lao interface . at the interface the o magnetic moment of the lao layer practically disappears . away from the interface ,",
    "this moment is 0.1 @xmath50 and remains constant in these lao layers . in the sro layers the o magnetic moment is slightly larger , at 0.13@xmath50 , and remains constant in all sro layers including the interface one .",
    "we have found that the ground state configuration of lsmo consists of manganese in the @xmath57 valence configuration . for sr concentrations less than 20% ,",
    "a mixed valence mn@xmath5/mn@xmath4 ground state was obtained , whilst for concentrations in excess of 20% a mn@xmath5 ground state was obtained .",
    "also , a close competition between fm and af - a mn@xmath5 states was seen with a crossover from fm to af - a mn@xmath5 around 35% sr concentration .",
    "the mn@xmath5 ground state has marginal spin polarization at the fermi level .",
    "we found , however , that the mn@xmath4 valency was not that energetically unfavourable and that small increases in the lattice parameter would lead to the occurence of mn@xmath4 in a mixed valence mn@xmath5/mn@xmath4 state .",
    "likewise , elongations of the mno@xmath14 octahedra lead to the formation of mn@xmath4 valence atoms . with the appearance of mn@xmath4 ions a half - metallic state is obtained .",
    "furthermore , in the mixed valence state we found that the total energy is minimized by an ordered array of mn@xmath5 and mn@xmath4 mno@xmath54 planes .",
    "the relation of this finding to the observed charge - ordered stripes@xcite will be the topic of a further study .",
    "as the sr doping increases , the mn@xmath5 state becomes more and more favoured with respect to the mn@xmath4 .",
    "the sr doping results in one more valence band electron which is obtained from delocalizing a mn@xmath4 @xmath11 state . in other words ,",
    "sr hole doping favours band formation instead of localization .    finally , for la@xmath48sr@xmath49mno@xmath9 , of huge relevance to spintronics applications , we suggest the following scenario to explain the half - metallic properties .",
    "whilst in la@xmath48sr@xmath49mno@xmath2 , from x - ray results , every mn - o bondlength is the same at 1.949 @xmath58,@xcite the bondlengths of mn - o in distorted lmo change from 1.907 @xmath59 to 2.179 @xmath59 , depending on direction .",
    "it seems however , based on pulsed - neutron diffraction measurements,@xcite that the jahn - teller distortion is still present in lsmo and could therefore , according to our analysis , lead to the formation of mn@xmath4 ions , which would be sufficient to give rise to a half - metallic state .",
