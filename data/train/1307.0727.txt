    "one of the most remarkable manifestations of the quantum nature of the electromagnetic ( em ) field is the so called ` motion induced radiation ' or ` dynamical casimir effect ' ( dce ) , whereby the accelerated motion of a mirror can make the em field vacuum to evolve to an excited state , namely , one containing a non - vanishing number of photons  @xcite .",
    "predictions about potentially observable dce effects have been obtained for a variety of geometries and systems , and by means of quite different theoretical tools  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the calculation of dce effects for the case of ` imperfect mirrors ' , by which we mean those that do not necessarily impose perfect conductor boundary conditions .    to conduct this study",
    ", we shall follow our previous work for scalar and spinorial vacuum fields  @xcite in which we used the particularly convenient functional approach proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the introduction of auxiliary fields inside the functional integral for the vacuum field , whose role is to impose the proper boundary conditions for the scalar field on each mirror .",
    "we shall here use an adapted version of the method , designed to deal with the case of imperfect mirrors , in the presence of the quantum em field .    in a recent work",
    "@xcite , the dce for imperfect mirrors has been analyzed using a scattering approach , for the case of a quantum scalar field . here",
    ", instead , we will consider the em case , and for mirrors that can be described by means of their vacuum polarization tensors ( vpt ) , which in turn are assumed to come from the integration of charged microscopic degrees of freedom constrained to them .",
    "our results are therefore applicable , for instance , to plasma and graphene sheets .",
    "formally , we will compute the euclidean effective action , and use analytic continuation to obtain the imaginary part of the real - time ` in - out ' effective action .",
    "the latter is proportional to the probability of vacuum decay , an effect due to the mirror s acceleration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : effect ] , we describe the kind of system that we shall consider , and define the corresponding effective action , within the framework of a perturbative expansion in powers of the departure of the mirror from its equilibrium position ( a planar , static configuration ) .",
    "we obtain a general expression for the effective action at the second order in that expansion , in terms of two scalar functions which entirely define the response functions of the mirror .",
    "moreover , up to this order , the result can be written as an integral that involves the transverse electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) reflection coefficients of the mirror .    in section  [ sec : examples ] we evaluate the euclidean effective action for different examples , discarding terms that do not contribute to the imaginary part of the vacuum energy ( i.e. , to the vacuum decay probability ) when rotated back to minkowski spacetime .",
    "the examples considered are distinguished by the different choices for the mirror s vpt .",
    "we consider , in particular , the vpt corresponding to a graphene sheet described by massless fermions .",
    "we present our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we shall begin by defining here the characteristics of the system and its geometry , as well as the conventions and approximations adopted to describe it .",
    "euclidean spacetime coordinates @xmath1 , with the metric   are used .",
    "the ( vacuum ) fluctuating field is assumed to be an abelian gauge field @xmath2 , with , interacting with a zero - width mirror .",
    "this interaction is realized , in a linear response approximation , via the vpt due to a medium confined to a surface .",
    "an approximation will be implemented here , regarding this object : the surface curvatures shall be assumed to be sufficiently small as to allow for a description where the linear response function corresponding to a plane can be used locally . in other words , at each tangent plane , we shall use the vpt due to a _ plane _ mirror .",
    "the rationale behind this approximation , as well as the kind of effect that are neglected by its implementation are discussed below .",
    "the most general kind of motion we shall deal with , amounts to a mirror whose shape and position can be defined by a single scalar function @xmath3 , such that , where @xmath4 . inside this general situation",
    "we shall focus on an interesting particular case , namely , a situation where the mirror s surface is defined by an equation of the form @xmath5 , i.e. , a rigidly moving infinite plane .",
    "the reason for considering this case is that it will allow us to find explicit expressions for some interesting models .",
    "nevertheless , expressions corresponding to more general functions will also be presented in the result for the effective action .",
    "we would like to stress that , to make the calculations in euclidean spacetime , is in no way mandatory ; rather , it is a technique that , in some situations , may simplify the intermediate calculations without altering the underlying physics . for the particular problem of moving mirrors ,",
    "the euclidean formalism has already been used in ref.@xcite .",
    "the connection with the  in - out \" and  in - in \" formalisms has been discussed in detail in our previous work @xcite . for more general discussions",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "the euclidean action @xmath6 is assumed to fall under the general structure : @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the free action for the electromagnetic field @xmath9 where @xmath10 and , in general , indices from the middle of the greek alphabet are assumed to run from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath13 accounts for the coupling between @xmath14 and the microscopic degrees of freedom on the moving mirror . to construct it ,",
    "we start by defining it in the case of a flat and static mirror at : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the vpt for the medium on the plane sheet , and @xmath17 .",
    "it depends , in this case , on the difference between its arguments , because of the ( assumed ) homogeneity of the medium .",
    "we are working in the usual linear response approximation , in which one retains only the quadratic terms in the gauge field .",
    "note that the component of the gauge field which is normal to the mirror s plane ( @xmath18 ) does not couple to the medium , something which is perfectly consistent with the assumption about the mirror to have zero width , since in this case the current associated to the microscopic degrees of freedom is confined to the plane .",
    "we consider now the general form of the interaction term for a moving and deformed mirror described by @xmath19 .",
    "formally , the integration of the microscopic degrees of freedom must be performed in a curved hypersurface , whose induced metric reads @xmath20 therefore , on general grounds we expect the interaction term to have the covariant expression @xmath21 where @xmath22 = 1 + \\partial_\\alpha \\psi(x_\\parallel ) \\partial_\\alpha \\psi(x_\\parallel)$ ] .",
    "the components of the gauge fields which are parallel the mirror ( @xmath23 ) can be written in terms of the components in the laboratory frame ( @xmath2 ) using three tangent vectors to the world - volume swept by the mirror during its time evolution : @xmath24 as follows @xmath25 note that , unlike for a flat and static mirror , the interaction term contains the laboratory frame component @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defspsi ] ) denotes the vpt for the medium on the curved mirror ( the subindex @xmath27 emphasizes the dependence of the vpt with the induced metric ) . for an arbitrary @xmath3 ,",
    "this is a rather involved object , which can be computed , in principle , using techniques of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes .",
    "we shall assume that the induced metric is almost flat , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "physically , this means that at each time the mirror is gently curved , and that its motion involves non - relativistic velocities , so that @xmath29 .",
    "we proceed as usual and expand the vpt around the flat metric @xmath30 where the first term is the flat vpt and the first correction , linear in the metric , will be quadratic in @xmath3 .",
    "one could compute @xmath31 , using , for instance a covariant perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "however , as we will see , the flat vpt will be enough for our purposes .",
    "our next step is to introduce @xmath32 , the effective action for the mirror s configuration : @xmath33 where @xmath34 \\ ; e^{- { \\mathcal s}(a,\\psi ) }      \\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath35 $ ] is the path integral measure including gauge fixing .",
    "then we use an equivalent way of writing the @xmath36 term , by means of an auxiliary field @xmath37 , a vector field in @xmath38 dimensions : @xmath39 where we introduced @xmath40 , a current concentrated on the mirror s world - volume : @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the inverse ( with respect to continuous and discrete indices ) of @xmath43 .",
    "the inverse is understood on the space of fields satisfying @xmath44 , the covariant divergence of the auxiliary field .",
    "the reason for introducing the factor with a functional @xmath45-function of this divergence has to do with the transverse nature of the vacuum polarization tensor ( ward - takahashi identities ) : the gaussian representation used in eq.([eq : lagrange ] ) has to be constructed not with unconstrained vector fields but rather only with transverse ones .",
    "indeed , @xmath46 is invertible , and has @xmath47 as its inverse , on the subspace of transverse fields .",
    "besides , the condition on the divergence of the auxiliary field implies the conservation of @xmath48 , and hence the invariance of the action under gauge transformations @xmath49 .",
    "using now eq.([eq : lagrange ] ) in eq.([eq : defza ] ) , and integrating out @xmath14 , we see that : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the vacuum amplitude for the free electromagnetic field , and @xmath52 where @xmath53 with @xmath54 denoting the gauge field propagator",
    ". we have found it convenient to use the feynman gauge , so that @xmath55 note that , since the auxiliary field is constrained to verify @xmath56 , in eq.([eq : defseff ] ) we may discard from @xmath57 any contribution which vanishes when acting on the subspace of fields satisfying that condition .",
    "let us now implement the second order perturbative expansion for the effective action @xmath32 to the second order in @xmath3 , the departure of the mirror from its average position .",
    "we first note that the formal result of integrating out the auxiliary field is : @xmath58 \\;.\\ ] ] denoting by @xmath59 the @xmath60-order term in an expansion in powers of @xmath3 , we obtain the corresponding expansion of @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath62-order term vanishes , as well as the first - order term , while the second - order term @xmath63 becomes : @xmath64 \\;.\\ ] ]    in this approximation , the effective action will be of the form @xmath65 for some two - point function @xmath66 . as we are interested in dissipative effects",
    ", we may neglect any contribution to @xmath67 which is local in derivatives of @xmath3 .",
    "this will simplify the calculations below .",
    "the explicit form of the zeroth - order kernel , which is translation invariant , is @xmath68 where @xmath69 @xmath70 is the fourier transform of the inverse of the flat vpt and @xmath71 .    regarding the second - order object @xmath72 , it receives many different contributions .",
    "however , as already stressed , we are here interested only in the calculation of dissipative terms .",
    "thus , we may ignore any term producing a local contributions .",
    "in particular , as the deviation of the induced metric from the identity tensor is already quadratic in @xmath3 , we can replace it by the identity tensor .",
    "for the same reason , we can omit the corrections to the flat vpt in eq.([pi approx ] ) , and replace @xmath47 by @xmath73 in eq.([mathcalk ] ) .",
    "note however , that there will be a non trivial contribution from the tangent vectors @xmath74 , that contain terms linear in @xmath3 .",
    "thus , @xmath75    we may obtain a more explicit formula for the second order contribution to @xmath61 , by taking into account the structure of the vpt , which appears in @xmath76 . under the assumption of invariance under spatial rotations on @xmath77=constant planes",
    ", this tensor can be decomposed into orthogonal projectors . indeed , since : @xmath78 the irreducible tensors ( projectors ) along which @xmath79 may be decomposed must satisfy the condition above and may be constructed using as building blocks the objects : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and . by performing simple combinations among them ,",
    "we also introduce : , and .",
    "then we construct two independent tensors satisfying the transversality condition , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , defined as follows : @xmath84 and @xmath85 defining also : @xmath86 we find the following algebraic properties : @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90    for a general medium , we shall have : @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are model - dependent scalar functions .",
    "in what follows , we particularize to the case of the rigid motion of a flat mirror along its normal direction , i.e. @xmath94 . in this case",
    "@xmath63 has the form : @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes the area of the @xmath97 space .",
    "using the projectors introduce above , after some algebra , we see that @xmath98 , the fourier transform of @xmath99 , naturally decomposes as follows : @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103    the decomposition in eqs.([eq : fdecomp])-([eq : fnu1 ] ) , the main general result of this article , implies that the em field problem is decomposed into two independent contributions , one due to @xmath104 and the other to @xmath105 , which , as we will see below , are the euclidean version of the te and tm mirror s reflection coefficients .",
    "the dissipative effects can be obtained from the imaginary part of the real time  in - out \" effective action @xmath106 , which is related to the probability @xmath107 of producing a photon pair out of the vacuum @xcite through @xmath108 \\ , .\\ ] ] the  in - out \" effective action can be obtained from the euclidean effective action performing a wick rotation . from eq.([gamma2fin ] ) we obtain @xmath109\\vert\\tilde q(p_0)\\vert^2\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath110 denotes the fourier transform of the physical trajectory in minkowski spacetime .",
    "it is noteworthy that the coefficients @xmath111 appearing in eq.([reflcoef ] ) and in the final formula for the effective action are just the static te and tm reflection coefficients of the mirror . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that for a thin mirror characterized by its vpt , the euclidean reflection coefficients are given by @xmath112 @xmath113 from eq.([piscalar ] ) and the definitions of the transverse and longitudinal projectors it is easy to see that @xmath114 inserting these results into eqs.([rtertm0 ] ) and ( [ rtertm ] ) one can verify that @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "an important remark is in order here , namely , that there are still in @xmath117 , as given by ( [ eq : fnu2 ] ) , contributions that are cancelled by the subtraction of @xmath118 , time - independent effects . in fourier space",
    "we shall simply implement that by subtracting from @xmath119 its value at @xmath120 . besides",
    ", depending on the large momentum behaviour of the @xmath111 functions , we may also need to perform the subtraction of more terms inside the momentum integral .",
    "indeed , depending on the superficial degree of divergence , we shall need to subtract from the integrand a polynomial of a higher degree in @xmath121 .",
    "note that these terms will not affect the imaginary part of the effective action , and could be absorbed by redefining the mass and , eventually , terms with higher derivatives in the classical action for the mirror .    in what follows we evaluate the resulting @xmath122 and its analytic continuation for some interesting examples .",
    "we start by considering the simplest case of perfect conductivity , for which @xmath123 .",
    "to evaluate the contribution of the te mode , we need to evaluate the integral @xmath124 or , using spherical coordinates @xmath125",
    "this integral is of course divergent . as mentioned in the previous section , to renormalize the form factor @xmath126 we follow a bphz approach , subtracting from the integrand its taylor expansion in @xmath127 around @xmath11 , up to the order @xmath128 ( dictated by the superficial degree of divergence ) .",
    "after the subtraction , the integrals in @xmath129 and @xmath130 can be performed analytically @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath131 which is the well known result for te contribution @xcite .",
    "we now consider the tm contribution .",
    "using again spherical coordinates , the form factor is given by @xmath132 following the same steps as before we obtain @xmath133 which reproduces the tm contribution computed using different methods @xcite .    the perfect conductor limit is useful not only as a consistency check of our calculations . indeed , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is a subtle difference in the boundary conditions for thin and thick perfect conductors .",
    "although this difference is not manifested in the static casimir effect , it influences the casimir - polder interaction .",
    "we have seen that this is not the case for the dce .",
    "we shall consider here the case in which the functions @xmath134 are constant ; namely , @xmath135 .",
    "the calculation can be performed following the same steps than for the perfect conductor case , inserting into the integrals the reflection coefficients latexmath:[\\[r_{t , l}(|k_\\parallel| ) \\,=\\ ,           \\frac{1 } { 1 + \\frac{2     it is worth to stress that the expression for the te contribution coincides exactly with that of a quantum scalar field with a @xmath45-potential , that was considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore , a vpt with a constant functions @xmath92 yields , for the te mode , the natural em generalization of the scalar problem , that was considered in several previous works to analyze the static and dce @xcite .",
    "using again spherical coordinates , we first subtract the taylor expansion up to the order @xmath128 , and then compute the integral in @xmath129 .",
    "the resulting expression can be integrated in @xmath130 analytically .",
    "the result is : @xmath137 where @xmath138    in the strong coupling ( almost perfectly conducting mirror ) limit , we get the expansion : @xmath139 among these terms , only the ones involving odd powers of @xmath140 contribute , when continued to real time , to the imaginary part of the effective action : @xmath141 \\;=\\ ; \\frac{|p_0|^5}{360 \\pi ^2 } - \\frac{|p_0|^7}{420 \\pi ^2\\lambda_t^2 } + \\ldots\\ ] ] where we recognize the leading term as identical to the one for a scalar field with dirichlet boundary conditions , and to the one of the te modes of the electromagnetic field for perfect conductors .    in the weak coupling limit",
