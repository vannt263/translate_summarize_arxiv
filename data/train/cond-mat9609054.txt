    "the standard spin - boson problem , described by the hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath0,\\ ] ] has served as a paradigm for the description of dissipative effects in condensed phases .",
    "some experimental realizations of such a hamiltonian include , e.g. , the detection of macroscopic quantum coherence in superconducting quantum interference devices @xcite , tunneling effects in metallic and insulating glasses @xcite , electron transfer reactions @xcite and the diffusion of light interstitial particles in metals @xcite .",
    "in each situation , the physical realization of the parameters in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is different .",
    "for instance , in metallic glasses at low temperatures the electron - hole pairs at the fermi level constitute the bosonic bath , while for insulating glasses , tunneling effects are damped by localized and delocalized vibrational modes .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian ( 1 ) embodies a wealth of physical situations and has been studied in great detail ( see for instance @xcite and references quoted therein , or more recently @xcite ) .    in order to study the dynamics of the two - level system",
    "coupled to a harmonic bath as in ( 1 ) , we need a method of `` tracing out '' the bath or spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the bath degrees of freedom can be specified by the spectral density function , @xmath1 which gives the bath density of states weighted by the square of the coupling strength between the two - level system and the bath . in most studies of the spin - boson problem",
    ", the spectral density takes the ohmic form @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a measure of the coupling strength , and @xmath4 is a frequency cutoff for the bath .",
    "we note that in many cases , such as the coupling of a spin degree of freedom to a three dimensional phonon bath in the deformation potential approximation , the spectral density ( 3 ) is not realistic , and must involve higher powers of @xmath5 .",
    "the usual approach to finding reduced equations for the spin variables of interest involves the use of the functional integral formulation of quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "formally exact equations may be found for the variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 refers to an average with respect to the canonical ensemble of ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 describes the population difference in the localized spin states of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) , given that the particle is initially localized in one well and in thermal equilibrium with the bath .",
    "it is the variable of interest in certain physical situations , for example , the electron transfer problem @xcite . the quantity @xmath10 , the symmetrized equilibrium correlation function of the tunneling coordinate , is related to the structure factor for neutron scattering off the tunneling particle , and is of great significance in various problems , including the antiferromagnetic kondo problem @xcite . for @xmath10 the long - time behavior at zero temperature",
    "is known from the generalized shiba relation which predicts algebraic decay @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath9 the situation is less clear , however some studies have predicted exponential decay as @xmath12 @xcite . despite the importance of @xmath10 , we will focus on the variable @xmath9 in the following .",
    "the formal path integral expression for @xmath9 is extremely cumbersome , and a suitable approximation must be implemented to obtain useful information .",
    "the so - called `` non - interacting blip approximation '' , or niba @xcite , is the most commonly used approximation . in this scheme @xmath10",
    "is entirely determined by @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "the niba may be obtained from the exact expression for @xmath9 by invoking a series of physically based approximations .",
    "for very low temperatures , these approximations often break down , unless @xmath3 is very small and only short times are considered . at zero temperature ,",
    "the niba is not justified in the antiferromagnetic kondo regime @xmath14 .",
    "the niba also incorrectly predicts asymptotically algebraic , rather than exponential , decay for the variable @xmath9 .",
    "lastly , niba incorrectly predicts that at zero temperature , @xmath15 .    despite these flaws ,",
    "the niba is useful for obtaining quantitative results for @xmath9 for high temperatures , when the tunneling dynamics is incoherent , and in predicting the qualitative behavior of @xmath9 for low temperatures .",
    "for instance , at zero temperature , the niba correctly predicts a crossover from damped oscillations to incoherent decay for the variable @xmath9 at the point @xmath16 .    as shown by aslangul et .",
    "@xcite , the niba may be obtained by first applying a small polaron transformation to the hamiltonian ( 1 ) , followed by a second order application of the usual nakijima - zwanzig projection operator technique .",
    "it has been known for some time that this projection technique , which leads to a master equation of the convolution form , is an order by order resummation of a particular type of cumulants known as `` chronologically ordered '' cumulants @xcite .",
    "the use of the `` chronological ordering prescription '' , or cop , when truncated at second order thus leads to the niba .",
    "interestingly , aslangul et .",
    "@xcite earlier applied a convolutionless master equation technique to the study of the zero temperature spin - boson problem .",
    "this type of master equation , which can be derived by using a different type of projection operator , involves the summation of a different type of cumulants , known as `` partially ( time)-ordered '' cumulants @xcite .",
    "this method was probably abandoned for two reasons .",
    "first , it incorrectly describes incoherent relaxation for @xmath9 _ for all values of _ @xmath3 .",
    "secondly , it can not be obtained in a simple manner from the exact path integral expression .",
    "the second objection is irrelevant , since it is still possible that such an approximate resummation describes the exact behavior of @xmath9 well .",
    "the first flaw , however , is quite serious . despite this",
    ", the expression obtained from the `` partial ordering prescription '' , or pop , which naturally resums to an exponential form , may be expected to give a better description of @xmath9 in the incoherent region .",
    "in fact , for values of @xmath3 greater than @xmath17 , but not too large , this method indeed describes ( nearly ) exponential relaxation . furthermore , as will be demonstrated in this paper , recent simulations of egger and mak @xcite show that the pop method more accurately captures the deep decay of @xmath9 at zero temperature for @xmath18 than does the cop ( niba ) method , _ even before the algebraic behavior of the niba is manifested_.    it is well known that by choosing a particular ordering in a truncated cumulant expansion , we are implicitly assuming different statistical properties for the relevant bath operators . the first purpose of this paper is to specify these statistical properties for the case of the spin - boson problem at zero temperature . using this `` stochastic '' type intuition",
    ", we then discuss various cumulant ordering schemes and their associated descriptions of the behavior of @xmath9 at @xmath19 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we first present a new derivation of the exact expression for @xmath9 that allows for clear specification of the statistical properties of the bath . for this purpose ,",
    "orthogonally to the conventional approach , we first integrate out the spin degrees of freedom exactly . in sec . 3",
    ", we briefly discuss the cop and pop methods .",
    "we then turn to a recently introduced new cumulant method , the `` non - crossing '' cumulants @xcite .",
    "lastly , in sec . 4",
    ", we compare the methods to exact simulation result .",
    "we begin with an explicit expression for @xmath9 through fourth order in @xmath20 .",
    "we could , if we wished , obtain these terms from the exact path integral expression for @xmath9 , however , we believe that the method used in this section most clearly shows the connection to the stochastic methods upon which the cumulant expansions are based . in effect , our method offers another route to the formal expression of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we begin with the hamiltonian ( 1 ) in the form , @xmath21 the quantity we wish to calculate is @xmath9 which is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the inverse temperature .",
    "we now diagonalize ( 6 ) _ in the spin manifold _ with the use of a transformation employed by shore and sander @xcite in their study of the self - trapping of an exciton coupled to phonons , namely , @xmath25 where @xmath26 the operator @xmath27 is seen to be the parity operator for the bath modes . in the transformed picture , we can express @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is now defined with respect to @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we now perform the trace over the spin degrees of freedom in ( 10 ) , leaving @xmath33,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 with @xmath35 this trace over the bath degrees of freedom is most easily performed in the small polaron representation , defined by the transformation @xmath36 in this picture , we may express @xmath37 as @xmath38 where @xmath39\\ ,   \\phi\\ ,   \\exp[\\xi(t)],\\ ] ] and @xmath40 the averaging ( denoted by @xmath41 ) is over the canonical ensemble of harmonic oscillators , ( i.e. , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) denotes a time ordered exponential with latest time to the right ( left ) . from this point on",
    ", all averaging will be with respect to this ensemble , and we will drop the subscript `` @xmath45 '' . since the spin degree of freedom has been removed , our method allows us to focus on the bath operators that arise in the expansion of @xmath9 . using the following properties of the parity operator , @xmath46 = \\exp[- \\xi(t ) ] \\ , \\phi,\\ ] ] and @xmath47 we can show , through fourth order in @xmath20 , the moment expansion for @xmath9 , @xmath48 where the moments @xmath49 equal @xmath50 ,   \\label{23}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath51.\\ ] ] note that @xmath52 . in this paper , we shall only use the first two nonvanishing moments , although it is a simple matter to execute the expansion to an arbitrary order . from ( [ 21])([23 ] )",
    "we conclude that @xmath9 is entirely determined by the statistical properties of the bath operators @xmath53 with respect to the canonical state of the bath .",
    "note that the operators @xmath54 always appear in pairs . in order to specify the statistics obeyed by the operators @xmath54",
    ", we now calculate the second and fourth moment of the @xmath54 s .",

    "this gives a type of `` wick '' theorem for the operators @xmath54 , and demonstrates the underlying reason why only the functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 appear in the exact path integral ( see eqs .",
    "( 4 - 17 ) to ( 4 - 22 ) in ref .",
    "it can now be explicitly checked that the expression ( [ 21 ] ) is identical to the exact path integral expression , at least through the fourth moment .",
    "note that the property ( [ 28 ] ) is different than the statistical properties held by commonly used stochastic processes such as gaussian , two - state - jump , or gaussian random matrix processes .",
    "we will return to this point in the next section .",
    "the moment expansion itself is not a very useful scheme for describing dynamics , because an arbitrary truncation of the expansion leads to secular terms that grow with time .",
    "we next resort to schemes that provide partial ( approximate ) resummations of the moment expansion to all orders .",
    "such schemes are the cumulant expansions that will be introduced in the next section .",
    "we now discuss the various ordering prescriptions which allow for partial resummation of the expansion ( 21 ) .",
    "each ordering method leads to a unique type of master equation @xcite .",
    "we note that , when carried out to infinite order , all of the ordering techniques give the same ( exact ) result . when truncated at a finite order , however , the results are different . in simple stochastic situations ,",
    "when the generator for time evolution ( the liouville operator ) commutes with itself for all times , i.e. , @xmath66 = 0 $ ] , the use of a particular truncated cumulant expansion implies a knowledge of the stochastic properties of the bath functions . in simple cases , truncation of the cumulant expansion in the `` correct '' ordering prescription can lead to _ exact _ results that may be obtained in the `` incorrect '' ordering prescription only at infinite order . in the quantum case described by the hamiltonian ( 1 ) , where @xmath66 \\neq 0",
    "$ ] , truncation of a cumulant expansion at finite order in any ordering prescription will never lead to exact results due to the non - commutivity of the liouvillian at different times @xcite .",
    "it is precisely this noncommutivity that leads to the variety of time - orderings of the operators @xmath54 in the expression ( [ 23 ] ) for @xmath67 . despite this fact",
    ", the statistical properties of the bath operators still dictate the choice of an ordering prescription that provides the most rapid convergence of the cumulant series ( if such convergence exists ) @xcite .    we begin by discussing the chronological ordering prescription , or cop . in this prescription , a master equation of the form ( see for instance @xcite ) @xmath68 is obtained .",
    "the kernel @xmath69 is obtained from the moment expansion as @xmath70 the cop cumulants , @xmath71 , are obtained from the moments by a recusion relation @xcite . in the present case",
    "this yields @xmath72    for the simple case where the stochastic liouvillian commutes with itself for all times , all of the cop cumulants @xmath73 vanish for @xmath74 if the stochastic bath functions have the two - state - jump behavior @xcite @xmath75 for @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the stochastic bath function responsible for system dissipation .",
    "if these bath functions have different statistics , it may not be a good approximation to truncate the series at low orders .",

    "this behavior has been qualitatively confirmed by monte carlo simulation @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the niba can not give the correct asymptotic decay of @xmath9 ( yielding the algebraic decay @xmath88 rather than exponential decay ) , and is unable to account for the depth of the decay in the region @xmath87 even before the incorrect algebraic behavior sets in .",
    "the niba is , however , known to work quite well for short times and weak coupling strengths .",
    "the analysis given in the last section provides a novel explanation for this fact . for `` short '' times and `` small '' values of @xmath3",
    "the function @xmath89 is a rather broad , weakly decaying function of time .",
    "when this is the case , the statistical property ( [ 28 ] ) of the operators @xmath54 is approximately of the two - state - jump form ( [ 32 ] ) _ as far as the integrations over the cumulants @xmath90 are concerned_. this approximate equivalence holds in a _",
    "sense , in that all of the four point correlation functions in @xmath67 ( see eq .",

    "for such times and coupling strengths , the niba will be essentially exact , as all cop cumulants for @xmath74 will vanish when integrated .",
    "we shall not provide precise meaning to the terms `` short '' or `` small '' , although their meaning should be clear in the context of the present discussion , and could be quantified without undue labor ( in fact `` short '' and `` small '' will be coupled in the sense that the effective timescale of oscillation or decay , @xmath92 , depends on @xmath3 ) .",
    "note that the statistical property ( [ 28 ] ) trivially gives two - state - jump behavior for @xmath93 , which leads to the correct behavior @xmath94 . while this is obvious",
    ", other cumulant techniques ( such as those discussed below ) do not embody this type of statistics for @xmath93 , and can not give the correct , freely oscillating solution for zero coupling strength upon truncation at second order . the statement ( often given in the literature @xcite ) that niba works for weak coupling because it is a perturbative scheme is thus not strictly correct .",
    "the ( somewhat heuristically ) demonstrated fact that the property ( [ 28 ] ) can resemble two - state - jump behavior under certain circumstances leads one to believe that extending the cop scheme to fourth order would not be useful , since this property is reflected in the vanishing of all cop cumulants higher than the second . extending the cop method to fourth order _ does not give a method for computing `` interblip '' interactions _ in the language of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now turn to the partial ordering prescription , or pop . at second order ,",
    "this method was applied by aslangul et .",
    "@xcite to the spin - boson problem at @xmath79 .",
    "the pop master equation has a convolutionless @xcite form @xmath95 @xmath96 may be obtained from the moments @xmath97 where @xmath98    the pop resummation is exact at second order for the simple case of a classical gaussian stochastic process .",
    "we note that the statistical property ( [ 28 ] ) appears to be very different from the standard wick theorem for gaussian processes .",
    "we may still expect that the pop method is better suited for the incoherent regime @xmath87 for the following reasons .",
    "first , the pop technique resums to an exponential form , which is expected to better capture the long time behavior of @xmath9 . in general , the pop method sums ( infinitely ) more terms than the cop method does .",
    "for example , expansion of the second order truncation in the cop gives , to fourth order @xmath99 whereas the pop gives @xmath100 clearly , the extra terms do not insure a more accurate result .",
    "for example , for weak coupling strengths , the pop must be carried out to infinite order to obtain coherent behavior . however , in the incoherent regime , the effective timescale , defined by ( [ 36 ] ) is very long , while the decay of the function @xmath89 is `` slow '' ( algebraic ) . in this case",
    ", we may expect that we must include terms like @xmath101 that extend over large portions of the integration region .",
    "as we will show in the next section , the pop method captures the behavior of @xmath9 better than the cop method in the incoherent regime , even before the full asymptotic time behavior is displayed .    at second order , ( @xmath102 ) the pop equation ( 38 )",
    "may be solved @xcite , @xmath103.\\ ] ] note that equation ( [ 40 ] ) describes a _ stretched exponential _ rather than exponential decay . for values of @xmath3",
    "that are not too much larger than @xmath17 , however , the pop expression should be much more accurate than the cop expression , at least at second order .",
    "we have now given some motivation for the belief that the cop method ( at lowest order ) should give a better description of @xmath9 in the region @xmath86 while the pop method should be better in the incoherent region @xmath87 .",
    "we now ask whether there is a summation method that is a `` hybrid '' of the two methods , in the sense that it can incorporate at low order features of the cop and pop methods . in the theory of stochastic processes ,",
    "such a technique has recently been developed @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the summation of `` non - crossing '' ( nc ) cumulants ( for a precise definition see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for simple stochastic situations ,",
    "if the coupling is not too strong , the nc technique ( including terms up to fourth order ) has been shown to interpolate between the two - state - jump behavior and the gaussian behavior @xcite .",
    "the nc description leads to a _ nonlinear _ equation of motion for @xmath9 @xcite , which at second order , may be expressed @xmath104 where @xmath105 to fourth order the master equation for @xmath9 in the nc scheme reads @xmath106 as in the previous two case , the nc cumulants , @xmath107 , may be obtained from the moments by a recursion relation @xcite . in the present case",
    "this yield up to fourth order @xmath108 it is clear that in appearance , the nc cumulants are a `` compromise '' between the cop and pop cumulants .",
    "we note in passing two interesting facts .",
    "first , in the stochastic realm , the nc ordering prescription truncated at second order is exact for the case of a stochastic bath modeled by symmetric @xmath109 gaussian random matrices for the @xmath45 s . in this case , the `` crossing contraction '' @xmath110 vanishes by means of a @xmath111 argument for @xmath112 .",
    "this leads naturally to the equation ( [ 42 ] ) and its systematic generalization ( [ 43 ] ) through the nc cumulants .",
    "( [ 42 ] ) has first been derived by kraichnan @xcite in the field of turbulences and fluid dynamics .",
    "our motivation for the application of this method is _ not _ based on a stochastic type of reasoning , but on the fact that in simple situations this ordering prescription may combine the benefits of the cop and pop methods .    before concluding this section",
    ", we would like to apply all three ordering prescriptions to the case @xmath19 , @xmath113 . here",
    ", it is known that the `` exact '' ( in the sense specified in ref .",
    "@xcite ) result for @xmath9 is @xmath114 in the limit @xmath82 .",
    "note that in this limit , the second moment becomes @xmath115correlated @xmath116 @xmath117 using the fact that @xmath118 , it is clear that _ all three ordering prescriptions give the same result _ given by ( [ 45 ] ) at second order .",
    "hence , the value @xmath119 corresponds to the _ white noise _ limit of the bath operators @xmath53 .",
    "before comparing the results of the three ordering methods , we make some comments on the methods discussed in sec .",
    "we have shown how three different cumulant methods give rise to different master equations with different properties .",
    "we have tried to physically motivate when each approach should have success when applied to the spin - boson problem at zero temperature .",
    "note that in general , the discussion of convergence of each cumulant series is a difficult task . this task is made more difficult by the fact that , at zero temperature , the algebraic decays of the bath correlation functions leave us with no clearly defined relaxation time for the bath .",
    "this means that we will rely almost exclusively on physical considerations and comparison with accepted results to determine the success or failure of the methods employed .",
    "the case of finite temperature , which can be studied by the same methods employed here , is often easier in this respect . if an exponential correlation time @xmath120 can be assigned to the decaying bath correlation functions , than it is possible to consider a systematic expansion in @xmath121 provided that this dimensionless parameter is small .",
    "when this is the case , the pop provides the most facile way of systematically summing terms in the parameter @xmath122 @xcite . in case of ohmic dissipation and finite temperature @xmath123 , the characteristic correlation time of the @xmath53",
    "is given by @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "this point of view provides a novel explanation for the familiar statement that the niba works well in the incoherent tunneling regime @xmath125 . in a stochastic language",
    ", this parameter region corresponds to the _ narrowing _ or _ markov _ limit of the @xmath126 s .",
    "similarly to the white noise limit mentioned above , one finds that all three cumulants schemes work well already at second order and provide essentially the same behavior , @xmath127 $ ] with @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "since we expect the niba to be accurate for very weak coupling strengths , we first turn to the case of weak to intermediate coupling strength , @xmath129 . for coupling strengths in this range , simulations at low temperatures have shown that the niba is qualitatively correct in predicting damped oscillations , but may fail in predicting the damping strength .",
    "an example of this is given by the simulations of makarov and makri @xcite which show that for intermediate coupling , niba may fail by slightly underestimating the number of oscillations in @xmath9 .",
    "we note , however , that these simulations were carried out for values of @xmath130 that are not very small . in fig.1",
    ", we plot the niba ( second order cop ) solution for @xmath9 against the solutions obtained from second and fourth order truncations of the non - crossing cumulant method , and the second order pop .",
    "note that , as expected , the second order pop solution for @xmath9 fails to produce any oscillations .",
    "we expect that for @xmath86 the pop will always be inaccurate at low orders .",
    "the second order non - crossing cumulant solution for @xmath9 , obtained from the kraichnan - type equation ( [ 41])([42 ] ) is similar to the niba solution , although the oscillation in @xmath9 is much weaker .",
    "the fourth order noncrossing cumulant solution gives a first oscillation which is very similar in magnitude to the niba solution , however , it describes one extra weak remnant of an oscillation .",
    "this behavior is very similar to the behavior displayed in the exact simulations of makarov and makri @xcite .",
    "although this example represents only one value of @xmath3 , similar results may be obtained for all moderately strong values of @xmath3 up to @xmath16 .",
    "thus , it appears that the non - crossing scheme works well in incorporating the qualities of the cop method for moderate values of @xmath3 when @xmath86 .",
    "one may be a bit alarmed by the magnitude of the difference between the second and fourth order plots of @xmath9 obtained via the non - crossing cumulant method .",
    "this is not necessarily indicative of a lack of convergence in the summation of the cumulants . as an example to support this",
    ", we mention the cumulant expansion results of aihara , budimir , and skinner @xcite . for a different model of relaxation , these authors compared the results obtained from truncation of the pop expansion at sixth order with exact simulations . for coupling strength that were not too large , they found that by sixth order , the cumulant method quantitatively describes the results obtained from simulations . in cases where convergence was obtained ,",
    "there was a large difference between the solutions obtained from truncating the cumulant series at second and fourth orders .",
    "in such cases , the fourth order solution was nearly quantitative , but sightly _ overestimated _ the exact result .",
    "we believe that this is precisely what is occurring here , although we have no direct evidence ( i.e. , a sixth order result ) for this belief .",
    "we base this statement on the similarity with exact simulations at slightly different coupling strengths , the fact that the fourth order non - crossing result shifts @xmath9 in the right direction , and the reasonable appearance of the result",
    ".    we now turn to the relaxation of @xmath9 in the incoherent regime @xmath87 . here , the beautiful path integral simulations of egger and mak @xcite provide a means of comparing the cumulant expansion methods with exact results . in this region",
    ", we expect the pop to be most successful , while the niba ( second order cop ) is expected to be worse .",
    "based on experience with simple stochastic situations , we hope , as in the coherent portion of the coupling space , that the non - crossing scheme can capture the essence of the pop in this regime . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the decay of @xmath9 calculated by differing ordering prescriptions for @xmath131 . it must be noted that the simulations were carried out for long times , but not long enough to show the asymptotic algebraic decay of the niba ( second order cop ) solution of @xmath9 , or the asymptotic exponential decay of the exact solution .",
    "regardless , the second order truncation of the pop still gives the most accurate description of the decay of @xmath9 . as we had hoped , the second order non - crossing technique is nearly identical to the pop for this value of @xmath3 .",
    "figure 3 shows the results for @xmath132 .",
    "again , the pop performs the best , while the second order non - crossing scheme over estimates the decay .",
    "as in the case of weaker coupling , we see if truncation after fourth order in the non - crossing cumulants can properly correct the second order result .",
    "this test is shown in fig .",
    "4 . while the results appear to show that the non - crossing scheme is converging to a pop - like description of @xmath9 , we again must exercise caution due to the lack of further concrete evidence for this belief . for such large value of @xmath3",
    ", it is quite possible that the cumulant methods break down .    one interesting property displayed in fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 is the near _ quantitative _ agreement between the pop description of @xmath9 and the exact simulation of @xmath9 for moderately long times . in order to test",
    "if this is a coincidence , we have computed @xmath133 and @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the @xmath136-th term in the expansion ( [ 38 ] ) . if the integrated",
    "second order pop cumulant is of order one for a given time interval , while all other pop cumulants are small when integrated over the appropriate time domain , then we expect the truncation at second order to be a good approximation .",
    "while we can not study all the pop cumulants , we have studied the second and the fourth . in fig . 5",
    ", we compare the properties of the second and fourth pop cumulants for @xmath132 .",
    "for @xmath137 to @xmath138 ( the boundary of the simulation results of egger and mak @xcite ) , we see that the contribution from the second pop cumulant is at least ten times greater than the contribution from the fourth cumulant .",
    "this strongly suggests that the agreement of the second order pop method with the exact simulations is no coincidence .",
    "in fact , the agreement between ( 41 ) and the simulation occurs precisely in the interval where the second order cumulant dominates the fourth order cumulant .",
    "since the slopes of the two curves suggest that this behavior continues for some time , we feel there is strong evidence for the somewhat remarkable conclusion that , for significant intermediate times , the decay of @xmath9 is quantitatively described by a stretched exponential . for longer times ,",
    "the decay is most likely purely exponential .",
    "we now summarize the results presented in this paper .",
    "we first carried out a new derivation of the moment expansion for the variable @xmath9 in the spin - boson problem .",
    "we then used this derivation to discuss the `` statistical '' properties of the relevant bath operators . using the moment expansion , we first discussed the chronological and partial ordering prescriptions that involve different types of cumulants .",
    "we discussed the merits and drawbacks of each method . in an effort to combine the merits of the cop and the pop",
    ", we applied the non - crossing scheme .",
    "specializing to the case of zero temperature , we tested each method , including fourth order terms when necessary .",
    "our results show that the non - crossing scheme is a promising candidate for combining the virtues of the cop and pop , especially for intermediate values of @xmath3 on either side of the coherent - incoherent transition value of @xmath113 .",
    "we note that more work should be done to test the validity of this claim .",
    "lastly , we have provided evidence to support the belief that the stretched exponential behavior described by second order truncation of the pop in the incoherent portion of coupling space may infact be very accurate for intermediate times .",
