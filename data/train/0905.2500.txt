    "studies on the @xmath4 meson production in hadronic collisions via different isospin channels have had a large contribution to the understanding of the reaction mechanism  @xcite . from the comparison of the total cross sections for reactions @xmath0",
    "@xcite and @xmath5  @xcite it was derived that the production of the @xmath4 meson with the total isospin @xmath6 in the initial channel exceeds the production with the isospin @xmath7 by over an order of magnitude , suggesting  @xcite the isovector meson exchange to be the dominant process leading to excitation of the s@xmath8 resonance .",
    "this mechanism is considered to be predominant  @xcite . however , relative contributions to the production process of @xmath9 and @xmath10 meson exchange are still not well settled  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we determine contributions of the i  =  0 and i  =  1 components to the total cross section of the @xmath1 reaction taking into account an entire available data base including our recent cross sections for the @xmath0 reaction determined near the kinematical threshold  @xcite .",
    "denoting by @xmath11 and @xmath12 the isospin i  =  0 and i  =  1 components of the total cross section for the @xmath1 reaction , we can write that : @xmath13 and that @xmath14 left panel of figure  [ pneta - deta ] shows the ratio of the total cross sections for the @xmath0 reaction to the total cross section for the @xmath5 reaction plotted as a function of the excess energy .",
    "it was surprising to observe this ratio to fall down at lower values of  q. however , as explained by wilkin  @xcite , to large extent , this behavior may plausibly be assigned to the difference in strength of the proton - proton and proton - neutron fsi . following the reference  @xcite the parameterization of the isospin i  =  0 component of the cross section for the @xmath0 reaction , taking into account proton - neutron fsi ,",
    "is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a constant , @xmath17 is an excess energy , and @xmath18  mev is the binding energy of the @xmath19 bound state  @xcite .",
    "analogously , the parameterization of the @xmath5 reaction total cross section ( pure isospin",
    "i  =  1 ) is given by : @xmath20 with @xmath21  mev being the  binding \" energy of the pp virtual state  @xcite , and @xmath22 being a constant .",
    "the value of @xmath21 was derived  @xcite from the fit of formula  [ faldt2 ] to the cross sections for the @xmath23 reaction  @xcite for which the influence from the proton - meson final state interaction can be neglected  @xcite .",
    "employing equations  [ faldt2 ] , [ faldt ] , [ eq3 ] , and [ skladowe ] one obtains for the cross sections ratio a following closed analytical formula which accounts for the interaction between nucleons  @xcite : @xmath24 we have fitted the function given by equation  [ krakow2 ] ( with c as the only free parameter ) to the data in the excess energy range from 0 to 40  mev where the higher partial waves of the nucleon - nucleon system are suppressed  @xcite .",
    "the result is presented in figure  [ pneta - deta](left ) as the solid line , and explains to some extent the observed decrease of the ratio at threshold .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 was found to be @xmath26 and the @xmath27 of the fit was equal to 1.6 .     and @xmath5 reactions .",
    "a superimposed line indicates a result of the fit taking into account the final state interaction of nucleons .",
    "( right ) ratio between the @xmath6 component of the @xmath0 total cross section and the total cross section for the @xmath28 .",
    "a superimposed lines indicate result of fits taking into account the final state interaction of nucleons ( black line ) , and assuming that the ratio of the total cross sections changes linearly with the excess energy ( straight line ) .",
    "[ pneta - deta],title=\"fig:\",width=234 ]   and @xmath5 reactions .",
    "a superimposed line indicates a result of the fit taking into account the final state interaction of nucleons .",
    "( right ) ratio between the @xmath6 component of the @xmath0 total cross section and the total cross section for the @xmath28 . a superimposed lines indicate result of fits taking into account the final state interaction of nucleons ( black line ) , and assuming that the ratio of the total cross sections changes linearly with the excess energy ( straight line ) .",
    "[ pneta - deta],title=\"fig:\",width=230 ]    a slight bump - like structure observed in the ratio presented in the left panel of figure  [ pneta - deta ]  with a flat maximum at the excess energy of about 50  mev  could be due to the fact that production of the @xmath4 meson in hadronic collisions proceeds via the intermediate resonance n@xmath29 ( m(n@xmath30 )  -  m@xmath31  -  m@xmath32  @xmath33  49  mev ) .",
    "this may indicate that coupling of this resonance to the neutron@xmath4 may be stronger than to the proton-@xmath4 channel .",
    "this interpretation is however controversial since it would imply a strong isospin breaking effects  @xcite .",
    "the total cross section for the @xmath28 reaction is a pure isospin i  =  0 since both deuteron and the @xmath4 meson have isospin equal to zero . in the case of the @xmath1 reaction",
    "the i  =  0 component of the cross section can be extracted from cross sections for the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath5 employing equations  [ skladowe ] and  [ eq3 ] .    in order to compare the production of the @xmath4 meson associated with the proton - neutron bound state  ( d@xmath4 ) to its production with the proton and neutron in continuum  ( pn@xmath4 ) in the way independent of the initial state interaction",
    "we have extracted the experimental values of the @xmath34 component , and compared them to the total cross sections for the @xmath28 reaction .",
    "the ratio of these two cross sections is presented in the right panel of figure  [ pneta - deta ] , plotted as a function of the excess energy q. an interesting observation is this ratio rises nearly linearly with the excess energy up to circa 60  mev , and above this value it starts to grow more steeply .",
    "this may suggest that from about 60  mev influence of the higher partial waves in the @xmath35 system is more pronounced than in the case of the @xmath36 system .    according to the reference  @xcite the low energy cross section for the @xmath28 reaction",
    "may be parameterized in the following way : @xmath37 where parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 are calculated from the nucleon mass , the @xmath4 and @xmath10 meson masses , and also the @xmath10 meson coupling constant  @xcite . as the latter is still",
    "not well known , and the values of parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 are model dependent   meson exchange current dominates the production amplitude .",
    "] we have treated @xmath38 and @xmath39 as free parameters of the fit .    dividing equation  [ faldt ] by equation  [ deta_cross ] we get : @xmath40 with @xmath41 being a constant .",
    "we have fitted formula  [ fit_func ] in the range between the threshold and q  =  50  mev ( see figure  [ pneta - deta ] ( right ) )   and  [ deta_cross ] apply . ] , treating @xmath41 and @xmath39 as free parameters of the fit .",
    "the fit procedure resulted in @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the value of reduced @xmath27 of the fit was equal to 1.4 .    on the other hand , the assumption that the @xmath34 to @xmath44 ratio is a linear function of q in the close - to - threshold region ( up to the excess energy of q  =  50  mev ) : @xmath45 yields @xmath46 , with the reduced value of @xmath27 equal to 0.3 . the best linear function fitted to the experimental data",
    "is presented in figure  [ pneta - deta ] ( right ) .",
    "one should , however , be careful in interpretation of the cross section ratios presented in figure  [ pneta - deta ] due to the rather low energy resolution for measurements of the @xmath0 reaction which was equal to about 5  mev for the cosy-11 experiment and circa 8  mev for experiments performed with the wasa / promice detector  @xcite .",
