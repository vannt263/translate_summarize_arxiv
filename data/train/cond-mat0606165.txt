    "understanding the effects of electron correlation and pseudogap phenomena  @xcite in doped oxides , including the cuprate superconductors is one of the most challenging problems in condensed matter physics  @xcite . although the experimental determination of various inhomogeneous phases in cuprates is still somewhat controversial  @xcite , the underdoped high t@xmath17 superconductors ( htscs ) are often characterized by crossover temperatures below which excitation pseudogaps in the normal - state are seen to develop  @xcite . in these materials ,",
    "the spectral weight begins to be strongly suppressed below some characteristic temperature t@xmath18 that is higher than the superconducting crossover temperature t@xmath17 .",
    "there are many experiments supporting a highly nonuniform hole distribution leading to the formation of hole - rich and hole - poor regions in doped la@xmath19sr@xmath20cuo@xmath21 and other cuprate htscs  @xcite .",
    "this electronic phase separation is expected to be mostly pronounced at low hole concentrations .",
    "recently , strong experimental evidence has been found for ` electronic phase separation ' in la - cuprates near optimal doping into separate , magnetic and superconducting phases  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of the hubbard model for studies of the htscs has been the focus of intensive research and debated for quite some time with no firm conclusions up to now .",
    "even though the small hubbard clusters do not have the full capacity to describe the complexity of copper ions and their ancillary oxygens detected in the htsc materials , it is still argued that this model can capture the essential physics of the htscs  @xcite .",
    "however , beyond one and infinite dimensions , there is no exact solution currently available for the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "it is also known that in the optimally doped cuprates , the correlation length of dynamical spin fluctuations is very small  @xcite , which points to the local character of electron interactions in the cuprates .",
    "therefore , exact microscopic studies of pairing , crossover and pseudogaps , by using analytical diagonalization of small hubbard clusters , which account accurately for short - range dynamical correlations , are relevant and useful with regard to understanding the physics of the htscs .",
    "our exact analytical solution appears to be providing useful insight into the physical origin of the high energy insulator - metal and low energy antiferromagnetic crossovers , electron pairing and spin density fluctuations in the superconducting phase .",
    "the following questions are central to our study : ( i ) when treated exactly , what essential features can the simple hubbard clusters capture , that are in common with the htscs ?",
    "( ii ) using simple cluster studies , is it possible to obtain a mesoscopic understanding of electron - hole / electron - electron pairing and identify various possible phases and crossover temperatures ?",
    "iii ) do these small clusters ( coupled to a particle bath ) contain important features that are similar to large clusters and thermodynamical systems ?",
    "our work has uncovered important answers to the questions raised above .",
    "this is a follow - up to our recent study , in which rigorous criteria were found for the existence of microscopic quantum critical points ( qcp ) , mott - hubbard ( mh ) and nel type bifurcations , and corresponding critical temperatures of crossovers and various phases in finite - size systems  @xcite .",
    "small 2- and 4-site clusters with short range electronic correlations provide ( unique ) insight into the thermodynamics and exact many body physics , difficult to obtain from approximate methods .",
    "in particular , we show that these small hubbard clusters , in the absence of long range order , exhibit particle - particle , mott - hubbard like particle - hole or antiferromagnetic - paramagnetic instabilities in the ground state and at finite temperatures .",
    "in addition , the 4-site ( square ) cluster is the basic building block of the cuo@xmath22 planes in the htscs and it can be used as a block reference to build up larger superblocks in 2d of desirable sizes by applying cluster perturbation theory ( cpt )  @xcite , non - perturbative real - space renormalization group ( rsrg )  @xcite , contractor renormalization group ( core )  @xcite , or dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) for embedded 4-site clusters coupled to an uncorrelated bath  @xcite .",
    "similar attempts at studying small clusters ( such as the ground state studies of weakly coupled hubbard dimers and squares by tsai and kivelson  @xcite ) have begun recently and the lessons learned here will be invaluable to such studies and useful to the condensed matter community in general . above all , these small clusters can be synthesized and utilized for understanding essential many - body physics at the mesoscopic level and hence are useful in their own right .",

    "unless otherwise stated , all the energies reported here are measured in units of @xmath24 ( i.e. @xmath24 has been set to @xmath25 in most of the equations that follow ) .",
    "our calculations are based on the exact _ analytical _ expressions for the eigenvalue @xmath26 of the @xmath27 many - body eigenstate of the 4-site hubbard clusters  @xcite .",
    "as we show here , this model , used in conjunction with the grand canonical and canonical ensembles , yields valuable insight into the physics of strongly correlated electrons .          the complete phase diagram of interacting electrons can be obtained with high accuracy due to the analytically ( exact ) given thermodynamic expressions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ensemble ] , possible electron configurations ( below half - filling ) in the grand canonical ensemble for the 4-site clusters are shown . the grand partition function z@xmath28 ( where the number of particles @xmath29 and the projection of spin @xmath30 are allowed to fluctuate ) and its derivatives are calculated ( exactly ) without taking the thermodynamic limit .",

    "the thermodynamic quantities with fixed @xmath29 ( _ canonical approach _ ) are certainly smooth , analytical functions of @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",

    "at finite temperature , the thermodynamic quantities @xmath31 and @xmath75 are both analytic and smooth functions of @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",

    "this procedure gives a rigorous definition for the mh crossover temperature @xmath77 ( from a localized into an itinerant state ) , at which the electron - hole pseudogap melts , i.e. @xmath82 . the mh crossover , due to its many - body nature , is also a cooperative effect which may occur even for a single atom .",
    "analogously , we define a ( positive ) spin pairing gap between various spin configurations ( projections of spin @xmath83 ) for a given number of electrons ( @xmath84 ) in the absence of a magnetic field ( @xmath85 ) as , @xmath86 this corresponds to the energy necessary to make an excitation by overturning a single spin .",

    "thus , at @xmath116 the spin and charge degrees are strongly coupled to one another . on the other hand ,",

    "it is also clear that short - range correlations alone are sufficient for pseudogaps to form in small and large clusters , which can be linked to the generic features of phase diagrams in temperature and doping effects seen in the htscs .",

    "the pseudogap formation can also be associated with the condensation of spin and charge degrees of freedom below spin and charge crossover temperatures .",
    "in addition , our exact analytical and numerical calculations provide important benchmarks for comparison with monte carlo , rsrg , dca and other approximations .",
    "finally , our results on the existence of qcp and crossover temperatures show the _ cooperative nature _ of phase transition phenomena in finite - size clusters similar to large thermodynamic systems .",
    "the small _ nanoclusters _ exhibit a pairing mechanism in a limited range of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath0 and share very important intrinsic characteristics with the htscs apparently because in all these ` bad ' metallic high t@xmath17 materials , local interactions play a key role . as",
