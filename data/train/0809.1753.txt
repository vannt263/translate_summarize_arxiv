    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binary stars containing a white dwarf primary component in a close orbit with a low - mass secondary star which fills its roche lobe . in most of these systems",
    "the secondary component is hydrogen - rich and transfers material to the white dwarf via an accretion disc .",
    "comprehensive reviews of the properties of cvs have been given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the evolution of cvs is thought to be governed primarily by the loss of orbital angular momentum due to gravitational radiation @xcite and magnetic braking @xcite .",
    "these effects are predicted to cause cvs to evolve towards shorter orbital periods until a minimum value of about 80min , at which point the secondary stars become degenerate and the cvs evolve back to longer periods ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of orbital periods of the observed population of cvs has a characteristic ` period gap ' @xcite in the interval between 2.2 and 3.2 hours .",
    "the deficiency in the number of systems in this period range is thought to result from the sudden cessation of magnetic braking due to structural changes in cv secondary stars @xcite .",
    "the number of cvs shortwards of this period gap are observed to be roughly equal to the number which are longward of the gap ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , theoretical studies of the population of cvs have consistently predicted that the vast majority of these objects should have short periods ( @xmath10hours ) due to their relatively longer evolutionary timescale @xcite , culminating in a strong ` spike ' in the population at a minimum period of about 65min .",
    "the remarkable differences between the predicted and observed populations of cvs have not yet been satisfactorily explained , although it is clear that observational selection biases have a lot to answer for .    to understand these selection biases , and to discover what the properties of the intrinsic population of cvs are",
    ", we are conducting a research program to characterise the sample of cvs identified by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "a total of 212 of these objects have been found spectroscopically from an initial selection based on single - epoch photometric colour indices @xcite .",
    "this sample is therefore not biased towards cvs which are variable or strong x - ray emitters , and also has a much wider coverage of colour space than previous large - scale surveys @xcite .",
    "results and further discussion of our project to measure the orbital periods of sdss cvs can be found in @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paperi ) , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    in this work we present time - resolved spectroscopy and photometry of nine cvs , and measure orbital period for five of these .",
    "we shall abbreviate the names of the targets to sdssj0043 , sdssj0337 , sdssj1601 , sdssj1637 , sdssj1642 , sdssj1658 , sdssj1659 , sdssj2232 and sdssj2238 .",

    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have presented time - resolved photometry and spectroscopy of nine faint cvs which were identified by the sdss . for five of these systems we have determined orbital periods ( table[tab : result ] ) , and four of these are shorter than the 23hour period gap apparent in the known population of cvs . this work brings the total number of sdss cvs with measured orbital periods to approximately 110 of the total population of 212 objects .    from vlt spectroscopy of sdssj0043",
    "we found an orbital period of @xmath2min , placing this object close to the observed minimum period for hydrogen - rich cvs .",
    "its spectrum shows a strong contribution from the white dwarf in the system , indicating that the accretion disc is faint and the mass transfer rate is low .",
    "we have used doppler tomography to decompose the spectra into a doppler map in velocity space .",
    "the map shows a circular accretion disc and an inner emission peak .",
    "the latter feature can be attributed to the irradiated inner face of the secondary star , if the velocity amplitude measured from the h@xmath0 emission line overestimates the motion of the white dwarf by a factor of two .",
    "the doppler map shows enhanced emission from two bright regions on the accretion disc .",
    "if the inner emission peak does indeed come from the secondary star , one of these bright regions is in the correct position to be a bright spot caused by the mass transfer stream impacting the disc .",
    "this interpretation is supported by its presence in a doppler map of the he 6678  line .",
    "the second region of enhanced emission is in an unusual position in velocity space and its origin is not straightforwardly explicable . a short light curve of sdssj0043 shows evidence of a variation with a period of @xmath12s and an amplitude of @xmath13mmag .",
    "the white dwarf component may be a zzceti - type pulsating star .",
    "sdssj1637 was observed with the vlt during quiescence , resulting in an orbital period measurement of @xmath14min .",
    "this object is a dwarf nova which has previously been observed in superoutburst , when superhumps with a period of @xmath15min were detected . using the calibrations presented by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath4 from these two period measurements . assuming a white dwarf mass of 0.8@xmath16  gives an estimated secondary mass of 0.13@xmath16 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the expected properties of a cv with @xmath17min , and together with the velocity amplitude from the h@xmath0 emission line point to the system having an orbital inclination of roughly 40@xmath18 .",
    "sdssj1642 was studied both photometrically with the ntt and spectroscopically with the vlt .",
    "the vlt data yield an unambiguous period of @xmath19min .",
    "the ntt photometry shows a number of features and results in a periodogram with a small forest of peaks at frequencies below 15@xmath20 .",
    "the spectroscopic period is in best agreement with the peak corresponding to a period of @xmath21min , but we prefer the spectroscopic value for our final orbital period measurement .",
    "doppler maps of the h@xmath0 and he emission lines reveal a clear accretion disc and bright spot as well as weak emission from the secondary star .",
    "more surprisingly , the he maps show an accretion disc with much higher velocities than those for h@xmath0 , indicating that the emitting region for he is physically smaller and closer to the white dwarf than for h@xmath0 .",
    "the h@xmath0 map also shows strong emission arising from the part of the disc opposite the bright spot , but the short duration of our spectroscopic observations means this unusual feature could be caused by brightness variation which differ from orbit to orbit .",
    "sdssj1658 is perhaps the most unusual system studied in this work .",
    "its sdss spectrum shows the strong emission lines characteristic of a short - period cv whose light is dominated by a hydrogen - rich accretion disc .",
    "however , our vlt spectra show a much weaker and narrower central emission line , and broad absorption features arising from both the white dwarf and secondary star , but no flux which could be unambiguously assigned to an accretion disc .",
    "the object was only 0.4mag fainter during our observations than when the sdss spectrum was taken , so the strong emission lines in that spectrum were accompanied by only weak continuum flux from the accretion disc .",
    "the velocity variation of the narrow h@xmath0 emission in our vlt spectra yields a period measurement of @xmath7min , confirming that this object is a short - period binary star system .",
    "the velocity amplitude ( 125kms@xmath22 ) is too large for the white dwarf , so we have attempted to assign it to the secondary star .",
    "the observational constraints can be satsified in this scenario if the white dwarf is massive ( @xmath231@xmath16 ) and the orbital inclination is low ( 1030@xmath18 ) .",
    "a modest number of photometric and spectroscopic observations of sdssj2232 suggest that this is a dwarf nova with an orbital period close to 4.5hr . from the flux contribution of the secondary star we infer a distance of roughly 3kpc , corresponding to distance of 2pkc from the galactic plane .",
    "further investigation is needed to prove its membership of this old stellar population .",
    "we obtained 59 magellan spectra of sdssj2238 , which is the brightest of the five objects for which we determine orbital periods in this work .",
    "velocity measurements of its h@xmath0 emission line give a period of @xmath8 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with a published photometric period , which also confirmed that the system contains a magnetic white dwarf with a rotational period of 6.7284min .",
    "these observations provide further confirmation that the faintest of the cvs identified by the sdss have predominantly short orbital periods .",
    "theoretical population studies of cvs predict a huge population of faint short - period cvs which has not previously been detected .",
    "our observations are now uncovering this ` quiet majority ' of the cv population .",
    "the unusual characteristics of several of the objects studied in this work show that even the short - period cvs demonstrate impressively varied behaviour , many aspects of which can not easily be explained in the standard picture of cv structure .",
    "our project to study the sdss cv population is invaluable for extending our knowledge of these fascinating objects .",
