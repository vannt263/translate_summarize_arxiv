    "the irreversible magnetization of type - ii superconductors was successfully treated by bean s critical state model ( csm ) in the early sixties.@xcite the basic idea is that the material develops a maximum ( critical ) current density in those regions which have been affected by an electric field , opposing to the magnetic flux changes . with remarkable simplicity",
    ", the csm could explain the dependence of the magnetization on the macroscopic dimensions of the sample , as well as the observed hysteresis .",
    "both features are a manifestation of the non - equilibrium thermodynamic processes which take place in the experiments and , thus , can not be explained by the abrikosov s flux line lattice ( fll ) theory.@xcite furthermore , hard type - ii materials develop such a pronounced hysteresis that the reversible contribution from the equilibrium fll may be usually neglected .",
    "nowadays , the hit of bean s intuition is well understood in terms of the fll dynamics in the presence of pinning centers.@xcite in the process of punching vortices in or out the superconductor one produces metastable equilibrium states for which the gradient in the density of vortices is maximum .",
    "this results in the development of the macroscopic critical current density @xmath1 and corresponds to the balance between a repulsive vortex - vortex interaction and attractive forces towards the pinning centers .",
    "bean s _ ansatz _ has permitted the development of the theory with a maximum simplicity while incorporating the main experimental facts .",
    "however , it was early recognized insufficient for problems in which lattices of non - parallel flux tubes must be considered . for such cases ,",
    "the current density within the sample is no more a vector with fixed direction , and additional prescriptions are required . on the other hand , a wealth of phenomena",
    "have been reported along the last decades associated to crossed field measurements .",
    "provide some outstanding experiments , and the interested reader is directed to the papers cited therein for more complete landscape of the topic .",
    "roughly speaking , when the experimental scenario is such that compression and rotation of vortices are induced , both the scalar repulsion between rigid parallel vortices and the cutting energy barrier for adjacent twisted flux lines come into play . in particular",
    ", this has consequences on the transport properties of type - ii superconductors in a magnetic field , as the pinning of the fll is strongly influenced by its internal stiffness.@xcite    several efforts have been made for the interpretation of rotating field experiments .",
    "bean himself developed an approach for such problems.@xcite however , to our knowledge , the most extensive general critical state theory is due to clem and prez - gonzlez@xcite who have developed the so - called double critical state model ( dcsm ) .",
    "these authors have provided a physical basis for the limitations on the current flow both parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic induction .",
    "thus , the so - called parallel critical current density @xmath7 and perpendicular critical current density @xmath8 were introduced .",
    "@xmath7 relates to the flux cutting threshold , whereas @xmath8 stands for the _ conventional _ depinning current density .",
    "recently , a more sophisticated approach was introduced , the so - called _ two - velocity hydrodynamic model_.@xcite essentially , this theory incorporates the flux pinning and cutting phenomena within the framework of fll s which consist of two vortex subsystems . under certain circumstances",
    "it is fully equivalent to the dcsm , but , different , non - expected scenarios are also predicted .",
    "in earlier work@xcite we have envisioned the csm realm as a phenomenological approach which can be formulated by means of a variational problem with constraints .",
    "this permits to deal with a wide class of restrictions on the current density .",
    "thus , the optimal control ( oc ) theory@xcite allows the minimization of a cost functional @xmath9 $ ] which weighs the changes of the magnetic field vector within the sample under the constraint @xmath10 , with @xmath5 a bounded set .",
    "this general formulation gives freedom to fix the particular region @xmath5 of feasible current densities .",
    "for instance , the isotropic hypothesis @xmath11 corresponds to choosing @xmath5 as a disk , and the dcsm conditions @xmath12 , @xmath13 , to an oriented rectangle .    in this work we present a detailed discussion of the variational principle ( sec.[varpri ] ) , as well as",
    "the general aspects about the hamiltonian equations which arise from our formulation ( sec . [ hameq ] ) .",
    "sec.[mag ] gathers a series of simulations of the field penetration profiles for two different selections of the control space @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , it is explicitly shown that the dcsm becomes a particular case of our treatment .",
    "then , sec .",
    "[ magloops ] is devoted to observe some properties of the magnetization loops which can be derived from the simulated profiles . in sec.[conclusions",
    "] we give a general overview of the model and discuss the compatibility of different choices of @xmath5 with available experimental data .",
    "in this section we will show that the coarse - grained electrodynamics of type - ii superconductors in the critical state may be formulated as a minimization problem . from a more conventional side , on using the dcsm approach , one can obtain the successive field penetration profiles in a magnetization process by means of maxwell differential equations , and the constitutive @xmath14 law for the material .",
    "these equations , together with the boundary conditions allow to solve for the dependencies @xmath15 .",
    "as it is usual in hard superconductivity we are assuming @xmath16 .",
    "now we recall that many physical theories , which are typically posed by a differential equation statement have been interpreted as the minimization of a given functional .",
    "for instance , the lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics relies on the equivalence of newton laws and the stationarity condition for the action @xmath17 , when the time evolution of the system is determined .",
    "below , we derive the functional @xmath3 whose minimization is equivalent to the standard approach for the critical state in superconductors . in order to gain physical insight",
    ", we will infer the csm equations after considering some aspects of the more familiar eddy - current problem in normal metals ( @xmath18 ) . assuming a discretization scheme in which @xmath19 stands for the magnetic field intensity at the time layer @xmath20 and ampre s law ( @xmath21 )",
    ", the successive field profiles in a magnetic diffusion process may be obtained by the finite - difference expression of faraday s law @xmath22 which defines a differential equation for @xmath23 in the spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "then @xmath23 can be solved in terms of the previous field distribution @xmath24 and the boundary conditions at the time layer @xmath25 .",
    "the minimization statement can be found by _",

    "c_@xmath38 for each advancing time layer is just an equivalent statement of faraday s laws in time discretized form .",
    "in addition , eq.([eqn3 ] ) allows a physical interpretation which can be used for comparison and generalization to other systems .",
    "notice that the minimization of @xmath39 balances the _ screening _ term @xmath40 and the isothermal _ entropy production _",
    "term @xmath41 .",
    "this can be identified as a quite general property of dynamical systems subjected to dissipative forces .",
    "the quasistationary time evolution of the system holds a compensation between some _ inertia _ term and the irreversible loss of energy .",
    "the minimum principle for the global entropy production rate lies behind the previous statement .",
    "it was introduced by i. prigogine@xcite in the context of linear irreversible thermodynamics and applies for non - equilibrium stationary states . as a simple exercise",
    ", the reader can check that minimizing @xmath42 with respect to @xmath43 one reproduces the discretized statement of newton s law for the motion of a particle against a viscous damping force . in the case of eddy currents",
    "@xmath44 stands for the magnetic field inertia , including both the magnetostatic energy term @xmath45 and the term @xmath46 , which describes the work against electromotive forces .",
    "eventually , we notice that hard type - ii superconductors may be treated by a modification of the functional _",
    "c_@xmath38 for normal metals .",
    "we want to emphasize that the concept of hard material is associated to a limiting case for the @xmath14 characteristic , i.e : the electric field is zero for current densities below a critical value ( @xmath1 ) and abruptly raises to arbitrarily large values if @xmath1 is overrun .",
    "in fact , this vertical graph limit is attained for the experimental situations in which the excitation typical period is large as compared to the magnetic diffusion time constant @xmath47 , where @xmath48 stands for the flux flow resistivity and @xmath49 is some typical length of the sample .",
    "then , for current densities below @xmath1 , @xmath50 vanishes as no electric field is generated in stationary conditions .",
    "on the other side , in the approximation of arbitrarily large flux flow resistivity , @xmath50 would diverge if @xmath51 and , thus , @xmath52 must be minimized constraining the current density to @xmath53 .",
    "we wish to remark that the definition of critical current density may be done in a very general sense .",
    "in fact , one can postulate vertical @xmath14 relations for definite directions of space as it is the case of the dcsm , in which one uses parallel and perpendicular projections with respect to the local magnetic field .",
    "one could even dictate that huge dissipation occurs whenever the current density vector @xmath54 lies outside some allowed region @xmath5 , generating an almost instantaneous change of the magnetic profile .    in the light of the previous discussion",
    ", the evolutionary critical state profiles can be obtained either by using maxwell equations and a vertical @xmath14 law or the principle :    _ in a type - ii superconducting sample @xmath55 with an initial field profile @xmath37 , and under a small change of the external drive , the new profile @xmath23 minimizes the functional _",

    "first , we will analyze the isotropic case @xmath11 ( i.e. : @xmath5 is a disk ) .",
    "then the variational formulation of the dcsm @xmath58 will be given .",
    "in this case @xmath5 is an oriented rectangle .",
    "the next section is devoted to some aspects on the mathematical formalism of the optimal control theory .",
    "we will show that this method provides a very convenient framework for applying the variational principle stated above .",
    "from the mathematical point of view , the problem of minimizing the action integral @xmath59 $ ] [ eq.([eqnvarpri ] ) ] with @xmath60 given , and @xmath61 fulfilling the differential equation @xmath62 is a problem of variational calculus with nonholonomic constraints ( constraints on the derivatives of the state variables ) .",
    "being the constraint set @xmath5 a compact region with boundary , we must take into account the possibility that the minimum is either reached in an interior point or in a boundary point .",
    "the machinery generalizing the classical variational calculus to sets with boundaries is the maximum principle of optimal control , introduced by pontryagin.@xcite oc is a standard theory in engineering , where dynamical systems are actuated by external controls ( limited to some maximal values ) in order to get a desired behaviour .",
    "the given system of differential equations , including the effect of external actions is named the control system , and the integrand of the minimizing functional is the cost or performance function .",
    "the mathematical problem here is similar , with ampere s law as control system and performance function @xmath63 , although of course the bounded variable @xmath64 is not an external control .",
    "as we will see later on , the algebraic condition of maximality embraces the cases of interior and boundary optimal points , therefore including the classical equations of variational calculus for unconstrained problems , and the modified equations for minimal solutions in the boundary .",
    "in addition to the original reference,@xcite the interested reader is invited to review refs . for a more comprehensive and topical statement of the oc machinery .    in this paper , in order to simplify the presentation , we fix the geometry of the sample to be an infinite slab , so that the control system ( ampere s law ) becomes by symmetry considerations a simple system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "other geometries , as the cylinder , give way to different control systems , and the case of a finite sample generates a more involved system of partial differential equations . for the slab geometry , with applied magnetic field parallel to the faces we have @xmath65 as control system .",
    "hereafter , we take the x axis perpendicular to the slab faces and the origin of coordinates at the midplane . by construction ,",
    "the vector @xmath66 is orthogonal to the physical variable @xmath64 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "notice that , despite the applied rotation , we use the same notation for the allowed control set @xmath5 .",
    "note also that the function @xmath69 has dependence on the local magnetic field ( this allows to include the usual models @xmath70 , and possible anisotropy ) , on the position ( for potentially inhomogeneous materials ) and on some independent coordinates @xmath71 , the control variables in oc notation , parameterizing the region @xmath5 .",
    "the first step in the theory of constrained variational calculus is the definition of a hamiltonian density , containing the performance function , and momenta variables that play the role of lagrange multipliers for the constraints .",
    "@xmath72 recall that here @xmath73 is a given profile .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath74 is not the usual hamiltonian function of classical mechanics in phase space ; here it depends on the usual state @xmath75 and momenta @xmath76 variables , but additionally on the control @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , the associated equations are not only the hamiltonian differential equations but also an extra algebraic condition of maximality , in order to determine the extra variables @xmath71 .",
    "denoting by @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 the optimal solution functions ( i.e. minimizing @xmath3 and satisfying the control system ) , the oc equations are @xmath80 the adjoint equations for the momenta @xmath81 and the algebraic condition of maximality @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath76 are fixed in this last condition . in general , this allows to find a relation @xmath84 .",
    "when this relation is replaced in the former hamiltonian equations [ eqs.([eqnham1 ] ) and ( [ eqnham2 ] ) ] , a well posed system of ordinary differential equations appears .    for the class of hamiltonian @xmath74 described above , the algebraic condition of maximality is fulfilled for a vector @xmath69 with maximum projection over the momentum @xmath76 . as a simple exercise ,",
    "the reader is invited to check that this rule produces the bean csm for one dimensional problems ( parallel vortices ) .",
    "thus , on choosing @xmath85 one has @xmath86 .",
    "the restriction on the current density reads @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "then , eq.([eqnmax ] ) gives @xmath89 and this leads to @xmath90 in agreement with bean s prescription .",
    "remarkably , for the case of multidimensional systems ( non - parallel vortices ) the maximality condition will give the _ critical current _",
    "vector both in modulus and direction .",
    "note that @xmath54 is determined dynamically , through the evolution of the momentum vector .",
    "the specific details on the distribution rule for the components of @xmath91 depend on the control space @xmath5 and will be discussed in the next section .    as regards the boundary conditions that must be used for obtaining the solution profiles @xmath92 from eqs.([eqnham1 ] ) and ( [ eqnham2 ] ) , several considerations must be made .",
    "firstly , in the absence of demagnetizing effects , @xmath93 is determined on the faces of the slab by continuity of the external applied field . for the remaining boundary conditions , two typical situations appear . in the first case ,",
    "the modified penetrating profile @xmath92 equals the former profile @xmath73 before reaching the centre of the slab .",
    "this gives place to an ( unknown in advance ) point @xmath94 such that @xmath95 .",
    "the free boundary condition @xmath96 applies in this case , and allows to determine @xmath94 . in the second case",
    ", the new profile never meets the former one , and the value of @xmath97 is unknown ; then , the corresponding transversality condition @xmath98 completes then the number of required boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian formalism developed above can be expeditiously applied to calculate the field penetration profiles for magnetization processes in which non - parallel vortex configurations are enforced . as the applied field",
    "is assumed to be the same on both sides of the slab under consideration , we can restrict to the interval @xmath99 . by virtue of the symmetry",
    ", the same behavior appears for @xmath100 .",
    "first , we will derive some results for the field penetration process in the so - called isotropic hypothesis : @xmath101 . in order to show the capabilities of the model",
    ", a field dependence @xmath102 will be allowed .",
    "in particular , the kim s model@xcite expression @xmath103 will be used . recall that the microstructure dependent parameters",
    "@xmath104 are included . for convenience ,",
    "the following dimensionless units are introduced : @xmath105 is given in units of @xmath106 , @xmath107 in units of @xmath108 , and @xmath109 in units of @xmath110 .",
    "then , the statement of ampre s law , together with the critical current restriction read @xmath111 above we have introduced the dimensionless constant @xmath112 and the so - called _ control variable _",
    "@xmath113 , which is a vector within the unit disk @xmath114 .",
    "this means that the current density belongs to a disk of variable radius , depending on the local magnetic field .",
    "thus , following the oc terminology , we have the _ control equations _ for the _ state variables _ @xmath115 .",
    "next , we require the minimization of the _ functional _",
    "@xmath116 $ ] constrained by the state equations . following the oc machinery introduced in sec.[hameq ] ,",
    "the maximization of the associated hamiltonian @xmath117 [ eq.([eqnhamiltonian ] ) ] with respect to the control variable @xmath113 leads to the condition @xmath118 .",
    "this has the physical counterpart @xmath119 , i.e. : within the isotropic model , the maximum allowed current density modulus @xmath1 is carried within those regions which have been affected by the perturbation .",
    "then , the hamiltonian equations that provide the field profile are    [ eqncanslab : all ] @xmath120 \\frac{dp_i^{*}}{dx}&=&h_{\\rm n+1,i}^{*}-h_{\\rm n , i}+ \\frac{\\beta p^{*}h_{{\\rm n+1},i}^ { * } } { h_{\\rm n+1}^{*}(1+h_{\\rm n+1}^{*})^2 } \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eqncanslab : b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eventually , appropriate boundary conditions must be supplied to solve this set of equations . as it was discussed in sec.[hameq ] these conditions are given by the external drive values , together with the field penetration regime .",
    "if the new profile matches the old one at a point @xmath121 ( partial penetration ) one uses @xmath122 and @xmath123 . within the full penetration regime",
    ", however , one uses the momenta transversality conditions @xmath124 .    in order to illustrate the bundle of phenomena which can be expected in crossed field measurements",
    ", we have calculated the penetration profiles for a zero field cooled sample to which a constant excitation @xmath125 is applied , followed by cycling stages of the other field component at the surface @xmath126 .",
    "we want to emphasize that , in order to approximate the continuum evolution , small increments of @xmath126 have been applied in the iterative solution of eqs.([eqncanslab : a ] ) and ( [ eqncanslab : b ] )",
    ". however , for clarity , only a selection of representative field and current density curves are depicted .",
    "the value of @xmath127 is set to unity for definiteness hereafter .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] displays the penetration profiles for the initial magnetization process that is induced by increasing the surface field @xmath126 .",
    "we notice that the conventional @xmath128 profile ( which was obtained by the standard csm ) is pushed towards the center as @xmath126 increases . in physical terms , a current flow @xmath129 is required for shielding the new field component @xmath130 . owing to the constraint @xmath119 ,",
    "this results in a reduction of @xmath131 ( the slope of @xmath132 ) and @xmath133 develops a subcritical behavior . just for clarity ,",
    "we have only plotted advancing fronts until the centre of the sample is reached .",
    "ongoing profiles will be shown in the next subsections .      here",
    ", we analyze the hysteresis effects which can be observed when the surface field is cycled .",
    "first , the maximum applied field ( @xmath134 ) is chosen so as to keep a zero field value at the midplane .",
    "we define the penetration field @xmath135 as the value of @xmath126 for which the front reaches the point @xmath136 .",
    "this is somehow equivalent to the so - called partial penetration regime in the standard csm .",
    "however , notice that now @xmath135 depends on the previously set value of @xmath125 .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] displays the results .",
    "it can be observed that @xmath137 basically shows a conventional critical state behavior , whereas @xmath128 develops a prominence .",
    "this shape relates to the corresponding slope reduction near the surface ( @xmath138 ) and the subsequent reentry in the unperturbed profile .",
    "physically , the distribution rule for the current density vector enhances the @xmath129 component near the surface in order to shield the change in @xmath130 ( i.e. : reducing latexmath:[$\\int     diminishes and , therefore @xmath128 flattens .",
    "an internal slope increase is obviously required for the previous profile @xmath140 to be reached at some point @xmath121 .",
    "notice the _ peak structure _ that appears in @xmath141 and the corresponding sign change in the @xmath129 component .",
    "the point of vanishing @xmath129 determines the maximum of the peak structure in @xmath131 , i.e : the full current flow is parallel to the y axis .      when the maximum applied field @xmath142 is allowed to increase beyond @xmath135 new phenomena appear .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] displays some outstanding features , which are sketched here : ( i ) it is apparent that the @xmath137 curves do not show a conventional hysteresis cycle structure .",

    "( ii ) contrary to the case of low field cycles , the profiles @xmath128 do not repeat values for the ascending / descending branches . when the sample centre is reached ( profile no.4 ) irreversible flux entry happens ( no.5 and no.6 ) .",
    "further changes ( curves no.7 to no.11 ) occur over a reduced shielding curve .",
    "finally , one can see that the aforementioned features are clearly translated to the current density vector @xmath144 .",
    "in this part we show that , within the isotropic model , a transverse field @xmath126 may effectively collapse the longitudinal diamagnetic profile @xmath128 .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] displays a magnetization process in which @xmath126 is increased up to the value @xmath145 in our dimensionless units .",
    "then , @xmath126 is decreased down to @xmath146 .",
    "further increase to @xmath145 is not shown just to avoid intricacy in the graph .",
    "however , the complete hysteresis cycle will be presented in the next section . here",
    "one can see that @xmath137 follows a typical csm high field evolution , whereas @xmath128 irreversibly evolves to a flat profile , compatible with the boundary condition @xmath147 .",
    "simultaneously , the current density related to @xmath132 becomes zero .",
    "thus , a constant trapped field @xmath125 is generated within the sample .",
    "any subsequent change in @xmath126 will not affect the trapped field and the associated current density component .",

    "the nonmagnetic initial state , which corresponds to the so - called field cooled experiment is analyzed here in the framework of our theory .",
    "we assume initial uniform flux density within the superconductor @xmath193 .",
    "then , consider the quasisteady evolution towards the state @xmath194 with boundary conditions at the surface @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the minimization of @xmath3 for the @xmath197 time layer requires an initial ct - zone given by @xmath198 \\alpha_{\\rm n+1}(x)&=&\\alpha_{s , n+1}-x\\quad ; \\quad p_{\\alpha}<0 \\ ; . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ct - zone spreads up to the point @xmath199 where the conditions @xmath200 are reached .",
    "this point may be determined by iteration of the governing hamiltonian equations ( eqs .",
    "( [ eqndcsm : all ] ) ) over the previous steps .",
    "such process leads to @xmath201 x_{v , n+1}=h_{s}\\left [ 1-\\cos{(\\alpha_{s , n+1}-x_{v , n+1})}\\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and defines the beginning of a c - zone .",
    "the equation determining @xmath199 has been obtained within the approximation @xmath202 .",
    "this condition yields the continuum limit of our discretized approach .",
    "notice that our expression matches the one obtained by the conventional dcsm .",
    "finally , the c - zone stretches from @xmath199 to @xmath203 , the point where @xmath204 vanishes .",
    "then , the field modulus profile becomes @xmath205 the associated momenta @xmath206 may be straightforwardly obtained by integration of their first order differential equations . in fig.[fig6 ] we have plotted the first step profiles @xmath207 .",
    "several points have been marked on the curves @xmath208 and @xmath209 , that correspond to the sequence of values of the control variable @xmath113 standing out in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "notice that @xmath210 always takes values on the boundary of the control space . within a ct - zone @xmath113 remains on a vertex of the square .",
    "as soon as a component of @xmath171 vanishes ( point 3 in our example ) the associated component of @xmath113 must be determined by the condition of zero derivative . in our case , this produces a jump to the vector @xmath211 , which defines the beginning of the c - zone @xmath212 .",
    "this jump in the control variable is known as _ bang - bang _",
    "phenomenon among mathematicians .",
    "eventually , if the center of the sample is not reached by the variations , a new jump in the current density gives way to the o - zone ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "though some experiments have been devised for the direct measurement of the field or current penetration profiles , the common practice is to record average values .",
    "thus , the vast majority of data on vortex matter in type ii superconductors consist of magnetic moment measurements . recall that the macroscopic magnetization of the sample is defined as @xmath214 , where @xmath215 stands for the uniform applied field .    in this section",
    "we concentrate on the magnetization loops which can be derived from the previously treated field penetration profiles .",
    "it will be shown that important experimental results can be reproduced .",
    "new observable features are also predicted , which may be used as a test for the physically meaningful critical current control space .",
    "all the results presented below correspond to the isotropic hypothesis , which has been mainly developed in this paper .",
    "the comparison to the already well established dcsm and a discussion on the selection of the control space for the current density are considered in the next section .",
    "first , we analyze the influence of the maximum applied field @xmath6 on the magnetization loop .",
    "fig.[fig7 ] collects the results corresponding to the profiles analyzed in subsec.[circ ] : low field ( @xmath216 ) , intermediate field ( @xmath217 ) , and high field ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "we have depicted both @xmath219 and @xmath220 for the zero field cooled process : ( i ) apply @xmath125 , ( ii ) increase @xmath126 from zero to @xmath142 , ( iii ) decrease @xmath126 to @xmath221 , and ( iv ) increase @xmath126 to @xmath142 again .",
    "@xmath222 roughly displays a standard behavior , but shows a noticeable peculiarity for the intermediate field loop .",
    "the loop fails to close after a complete field cycle .",
    "this feature was not noticed for the low / high field loops , at least to the numerical precision of our calculations .",
    "the @xmath223 curves show a quite less conventional behavior as compared to one dimensional measurements in which a single field component appears .",
    "in addition , qualitatively different tendencies can be observed in terms of the value @xmath6 .",
    "thus , low field cycles produce a _ butterfly _ loop ; intermediate fields produce a descending behavior for the transverse magnetic moment , and high fields produce the irreversible collapse of magnetization .    as a final observation",
    ", we describe an outstanding feature that was observed in our simulations . a second cycle in the applied field @xmath126 succeeds to close the hysteresis loop @xmath222 in the intermediate field region .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath224 keeps the descending trend , though seeming to stabilize around a non - vanishing value .",
    "this has been depicted in fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "we want to emphasize that our intermediate field simulations reproduce the experimental observations in ref .",
    "and in some related papers cited therein .",
    "thus , the isotropic hypothesis sets a simple model for those crossed field measurements .",
    "furthermore , we suggest to extend such measurements as a test of the theory , i.e. : perform low / high field loops and a second cycle in order to check the predicted features .",
    "we have introduced a variational formulation that generalizes bean s critical state model for hard superconductors , while keeping its conceptual simplicity . in the spirit of the original theory ,",
    "we have also avoided the explicit use of the electric field @xmath225 .",
    "however , the time evolution of the magnetic field profiles @xmath226 can be obtained by replacing @xmath225 with an appropriate restriction on the current density @xmath54 flowing within the sample .",
    "mathematically , a wide range of possibilities are allowed as we pose it in the form @xmath227 with @xmath5 a bounded set . upon the selection of a definite set @xmath5",
    ", our theory may be considered as the background for a variety of critical state models . in particular , we have analyzed the cases of choosing either a circle or a rectangle ( isotropic model and dcsm respectively ) .",
    "the variational quantity which is minimized under the aforementioned restriction has got a clear physical interpretation and quite general validity .",
    "we propose that the time evolution is governed by the balance between a screening term ( inertia ) and an entropy production term .",
    "this relies on basic principles of non - equilibrium thermodynamics.@xcite within the usual assumption of instant response ( vertical @xmath14 graph ) the singular behavior of @xmath228 is treated by replacing the associated term with the condition @xmath229 in the minimization principle .",
    "this kind of statement fits the mathematical theory of optimal control,@xcite that has been applied in this paper .",
    "the method is appropriate for the numerical treatment of realistic problems in which the magnetization is a vector quantity .",
    "such situation occurs in experimental setups designed for studying the interaction of twisted vortices and in the field of technological applications of hard type - ii superconductors .",
    "we want to emphasize that the selection of the permitted set @xmath5 for the current density should be either justified in terms of fundamental theories or bounded by experimental observations .",
    "the scope of our paper is to provide a suitable mathematical treatment for general csm problems and a physical background for the method .",
    "a well posed inversion theory , allowing to obtain the set @xmath5 from experiments is still an open question .",
    "however , some conclusions can be drawn from the comparison of simulations with different sets @xmath5 .",
    "on the one side , some experimental observations are quite independent of the region @xmath5 in use .",
    "this is the case of the field penetration profiles in rotating field experiments .",
    "a very similar behavior is predicted either by the isotropic or dcsm hypothesis.@xcite on the other side , one can find outstanding differences between these two models .",
    "firstly , the former predicts the criticality condition @xmath230 for those regions which have been affected by an electric field . within the dcsm framework , however , one can obtain _ critical _ regions ( ct zones ) where @xmath231 and _ subcritical _ regions ( c or t zones ) where @xmath232 .",
    "microscopic probes can be used to investigate this property .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "reports neutron polarization analysis of the magnetic field profiles within ceramic ybco samples subjected to rotation stages .",
    "the isotropic hypothesis seems to be favoured for this josephson medium . on the macroscopic side",
    ", one can design adequate experiments which check the compatibility with specific selections of @xmath5 .",
    "the investigation of the so - called _",
    "magnetization collapse_@xcite is a promising possibility .",
    "in fact , recent experimental results on melt - textured and single crystal ybco samples@xcite are nicely described within the isotropic model .",
    "the authors of ref . have studied the transverse magnetic moment @xmath220 suppression by cycling the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath126 . as the most important observed feature they emphasize the symmetric decrease of @xmath220 for the diamagnetic and paramagnetic initial states of the sample .",
    "this is shown to be in clear contradiction with the dcsm hypothesis and qualitatively interpreted by their _ two - velocity hydrodynamic model_. in fig.[fig9 ] we show that our general critical state theory gives a quite satisfactory explanation of the experimental facts .",
    "we get a symmetric suppression of @xmath220 .",
    "the field penetration profiles show that the slope decrease in @xmath233 near the surface , due to the enhancement of the current density component which shields the change in @xmath151 , occurs in a quite similar fashion , regardless the initial magnetic state .",
    "additionally , we want to notice that the behavior of @xmath220 upon a second cycle in @xmath126 which is observed in our simulations ( see fig.[fig8 ] ) gives further evidence of the validity of the model .",
    "the coincidence with the experimental data depicted in fig.5 of ref .",
    "is remarkable .",
    "finally , we will comment on some future extensions of our work .",
    "here we have used a time - discretization scheme , and a slab geometry , in order to produce an ordinary differential equation statement of our principle .",
    "this simplifies the theory , but should not be considered as a limitation .",
    "optimal control for systems governed by partial differential equations may be applied for more general cases .",
    "thus , one could afford a continuum approach to the problem and also include the sample finite size effects if necessary .",
    "other issues as the use of different physically meaningful control sets @xmath5 ( f.i .",
    ": elliptic , so as to incorporate material anisotropy ) , spatial inhomogeneity or surface barrier effects are also suggested .",
