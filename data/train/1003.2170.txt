    "the short proof by apostol ( 1983 ) can be found in ref .",
    "he starts by expanding the integrand of beukers integral @xmath18 as a geometric series , in order to show that it is equivalent to @xmath19 the interchange of integrals and sums being justifiable by the fact that each integrand is nonnegative and the sums converge absolutely ( see the only corollary of theorem  7.16 in ref .",
