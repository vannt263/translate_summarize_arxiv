    "the spatial velocity gradient to lagrangian evolution of the deformation gradient tensor provides significant insights into the deformation structure of the flow .",
    "whilst this problem is well - studied in the context of turbulent flows  @xcite there also exist several classes of steady 3d flow including chaotic and porous media flow which exhibit complex deformation behaviours .",
    "the steady nature of these flows imposes important constraints upon the evolution dynamics of both the velocity and deformation gradient tensors and so simplifies the link between flow structure and deformation .",
    "such insights are of relevance to studies of fluid mixing , scalar dissipation or pair dispersion as they allow statistically quantified flow properties to be linked to evolution of fluid deformation which directly controls the associated fluid - borne phenomena . for example , in the context of fluid mixing , the distribution of lagrangian fluid stretching rates serves as a quantitative input for lamellar mixing models  @xcite based upon evolution and coalescence of concentration inhomogeneities which evolve as interacting lamellae .",
    "similarly , the evolution of material surfaces and interfaces governs chemical reaction and front propagation . whilst fluid deformation plays a pivotal role in these problems , it is often difficult to correlate lagrangian deformation to eulerian properties of the flow field",
    "this is particularly challenging in the case of highly heterogeneous flow fields where perturbation methods are not appropriate .",
    "fluid deformation and strain history in non - newtonian fluids controls the development of material stress and molecular or fibre orientation , and so is central to the constitutive modelling of complex fluids  @xcite .",
    "many such constitutive models are posed in terms of a memory integral representation for the stress tensor  @xcite , the solution of which can be very computationally intensive .",
    "several works  @xcite have devised lagrangian numerical methods to alleviate the computational overhead associated with tracking and resolving particle trajectories and calculation of associated strain histories and convolutions thereof .",
    "this computational overhead is significantly reduced when the system is in transformed in streamline coordinates  @xcite , resulting in an upper triangular rate of strain tensor . for steady flows tracking of lagrangian trajectories and",
    "free surface flows is greatly simplified as particles are confined to fluid streamlines  @xcite .",
    "this approach also simplifies calculation of fluid deformation and strain history , as the deformation gradient tensor admits closed - form solution consisting of a definite integrals evaluated along the streamline  @xcite .",
    "this solution permits much more efficient calculation of both fluid deformation , strain history and associated convolutions .",
    "reorientation into streamline coordinates is also closely related to qr decomposition methods  @xcite for accurate computation of lyapunov exponents in continuous dynamical systems ( posed as linear first order odes ) .",
    "this approach is based upon continuous decomposition of the fundamental solution matrix into orthogonal @xmath0 and upper triangular @xmath1 components which satisfy individual auxiliary evolution equations ( odes ) and possess beneficial qualities with respect to numerical approximation of lyapunov spectra and adherence to constraints such as regularity and preservation of phase space .",
    "qr decomposition of 2 degree - of - freedom ( d.o.f ) autonomous linear first - order continuous dynamical systems is directly analogous to that of 2d fluid deformation in streamline coordinates , whereby the orthogonal matrix @xmath0 represents a rotation into the `` streamline '' coordinates of the dynamical system , and the upper triangular matrix @xmath1 is given by closed - form integrals of the reoriented systems along a `` streamline '' .",
    "previously , qr decomposition methods have been considered as primarily numerical techniques for efficient and accurate computation , rather than to elucidate the governing dynamics and constraints of the dynamical system .    as such , reorientation of deformation evolution in 2d flows into streamline coordinates not only provides benefits with respect to numerical analysis , but also basic physical properties of the flow field ( e.g. incompressibility , mass conservation ) are naturally preserved by this formulation . moreover , additional topological constraints associated with steady flow of continua ( or autonomous continuous dynamical systems in general ) are naturally recovered without need for ad - hoc enforcement .",
    "these constraints are particularly relevant as they directly limit evolution of the deformation gradient tensor .",
    "one such constraint is imposed by the poincar - bendixson theorem  @xcite which arises due to the fact that 1d streamlines can not `` cross '' each other in a steady 2d flow .",
    "a direct consequence of this topological constraint is that fluid deformation in steady 2d flows on topologically simple manifolds can only grow at most algebraically in time .",
    "this constraint has important implications for the construction of models of fluid deformation in such flows , as naive implementations inherently generate exponential fluid stretching due to the homogeneous linear form of the temporal deformation evolution equation ( [ eqn : deform ] ) .",
    "although sub - exponential stretching can be imposed via _",
    "ad - hoc _ means such as the imposition of exponential waiting times between stretching events  @xcite , such dynamics are not supported by experimental observations . to properly capture the underlying deformation dynamics",
    ", it is necessary that the modelling framework naturally recovers constraints on the deformation dynamics .",
    "such constraints both simplify the modelling process and more clearly elucidate the role of flow structure in controlling fluid deformation .",
    "whilst the poincar - bendixson theorem applies to 2d steady flow fields ( or autonomous continuous dynamical systems on manifolds of zero topological genus in general ) , it also has significant implications for deformation in some steady 3d flows . as shown in @xcite , flows with zero helicity density also must exhibit sub - exponential stretching as a consequence .",
    "the local helicity density @xmath2 introduced by moffatt  @xcite is the product of the fluid velocity @xmath3 and vorticity @xmath4 @xmath5 and the total helicity @xmath6 given by the volume integral @xmath7 over the closed flow domain @xmath8 is a measure of topological complexity of the flow field , related to the total knottedness of vortex lines within @xmath8 . there exist a wide class of zero helicity density flows , including all 2d flows ; e.g. those defined by a stokes streamfunction @xmath9 , @xmath10 , irrotational 2d and 3d flows @xmath11 in terms of the velocity potential @xmath12 , isotropic heterogeneous darcy flow @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity ) , and toroidal flows @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the toroidal potential such as the arter flow  @xcite . note that in general tensorial darcy flows have non - zero helicity density @xcite .",
    "spositio  @xcite shows that fluid streamlines in zero helicity density flows are confined to topologically simple 2d surfaces to which the poincar - bendixson locally applies , enforcing sub - exponential fluid deformation under steady flow conditions . as per 2d steady flow",
    ", an appropriate modelling framework must enforce this constraint to avoid spurious non - physical behaviour .",
    "the use of streamline coordinates for steady 3d flows is analogous to the qr method for 3 d.o.f .",
    "systems , however in 3d the qr method does not necessarily conform to streamline coordinates and so does not recover these topological constraints .",
    "such constraints not only have significant implications for models of fluid deformation in random flows , but also the fluid mechanics of complex fluids , as the rate of fluid stretching is integral to many constitutive models .    as outlined above , transformation into streamline",
    "coordinates in steady 2d flow greatly simplifies the evolution equations for the deformation tensor and recovers constraints upon the deformation dynamics . in this paper",
    "we extend this concept to steady 3d flows and uncover the deformation structure of several classes of such flows . whilst streamline coordinates are unique in steady 2d flows ,",
    "such a frame is not unique in steady 3d flows due arbitrary rotation of frame about a streamline , and do not necessarily render the transformed velocity gradient tensor upper triangular . in this study",
    "we develop a transform which aligns with 3d streamline coordinates and also renders the velocity gradient tensor upper triangular . following adachi  @xcite we term a system with these properties as a _ protean _",
    "coordinate system , which inherits the advantages of both the qr decomposition and streamline coordinate systems with respect to both numerical computation and physical insights into the dynamics which govern fluid deformation in 2d and 3d steady flows .",
    "we present an alternative derivation to previous studies  @xcite for the streamline coordinate transform into 2d flow , and then extend this to steady 3d flows to generate integral solutions of the full strain tensor . whilst it was previously considered  @xcite",
    "that such analysis was too complex to be undertaken in 3d flow , we show this is possible for all steady 3d flow as the qr decomposition may be applied to all real square matrices .",
    "due to the simplicity of deformation evolution equation in the protean frame , this transformation elucidates the link between eulerian flow features and fluid deformation along lagrangian trajectories and moreover , naturally enforces physical constraints upon deformation evolution .",
    "this structure naturally recovers the inherent kinematic and topological constraints associated with the poincar - bendixson theorem and zero helicity flow , and so provides a framework for the development of a kinematically - consistent continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) model  @xcite of deformation in steady 3d flow . by way of example",
    "we apply this approach to a series of model flows , both compressible and incompressible , helical and non - helical and assess the numerical accuracy of the method and implications for understanding fluid deformation structure in complex 3d flows .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows ; in the following section we briefly review the evolution of finite strain tensors in continuous media , and in section  [ sec : transform ] we consider objective transformation of the deformation gradient tensor into the protean frame .",
    "we apply this transformation in section  [ sec:2d ] to derive the core results for steady 2d flow via a more transparent route than previous studies , and then extend application to 3d flow in section  [ sec:3d ] .",
    "this method is then applied to the example flow classes in section  [ sec : examples ] and concluding remarks are provided section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "fluid deformation and strain history are typically couched in terms of finite - strain tensors such as the right cauchy - green @xmath17 , left cauchy - green ( finger ) @xmath18 , green - lagrangian @xmath19 and hencky @xmath20 strain tensors @xcite , all of which are derived directly from the deformation gradient tensor @xmath21 , defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the @xmath24 respectively are reference material vectors in the eulerian and lagrangian frames .",

    "such computations may be significantly simplified via transformation of the deformation gradient @xmath36 into the protean coordinate frame  @xcite .",
    "whilst a formal description of fluid deformation in an arbitrary orthogonal curvilinear coordinate frame requires an excursion into differential geometry and tensor calculus , to clarify exposition and physical interpretation we consider transform of an orthogonal cartesian coordinate system , and note that the formulation herein may be extended to general curvilinear coordinates via the standard tools of differential geometry .",
    "we denote spatial coordinates in the cartesian coordinate system as @xmath52 , and the reoriented protean ( streamline ) coordinate system by @xmath53 , such that the arbitrary velocity vector @xmath54 in the cartesian frame transforms to @xmath55 in the protean frame , where @xmath56 .",

    "this constraint limits the rate of strain tensor along as streamline ( [ eqn : velevolve ] ) , as formalised by the poincar - bendixson theorem .",
    "one implication of this theorem is that fluid stretching in steady 2d flow both parallel and transverse to the flow direction ( quantified respectively by @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) must converge toward zero mean over long times for both incompressible and compressible flow . as such",

    "in contrast to steady 2d flow , the additional degree of freedom associated with steady 3d flow admits the possibility of chaotic lagrangian dynamics .",

    "as the protean coordinate frame renders the transformed velocity gradient tensor @xmath67 upper triangular , this method is directly analogous to the continuous qr decomposition method for a @xmath89-dimensional autonomous nonlinear dynamical system @xmath168 which may be considered as the generalisation of the advection equation @xmath169 for a steady flow field . for a given solution trajectory @xmath41 , the lyapunov exponents of ( [ eqn : fx ] )",
    "are given by the eigenvalues of the fundamental solutions @xmath170 of the linear variational equation @xmath171 which is the generalisation of ( [ eqn : deform ] ) , where @xmath172 is the jacobian along the trajectory @xmath41 .",
    "the continuous qr method considers the decomposition @xmath173 where @xmath174 is orthogonal and @xmath175 upper triangular , and satisfy the auxiliary equations @xmath176 where , similar to ( [ eqn : ftransform])-([eqn : epsilon ] ) , @xmath177 @xmath178_{ij},&\\quad i > j,\\\\ 0,&\\quad i = j,\\\\ -[\\mathcal{q}^t(t)\\cdot\\mathcal{a}(t)\\cdot\\mathcal{q}(t)]_{ji},&\\quad i < j .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] hence the evolution equations for the orthogonal and upper triangular matrices @xmath174 , @xmath179 , @xmath175 for the continuous qr method are directly analogous to the reorientation operator @xmath59 , protean rate of strain @xmath67 and protean deformation gradient @xmath90 tensors for the protean transform method .",
    "however , the actual values differ in that the initial condition for the qr method corresponds to the unrotated frame ( @xmath152 ) , whereas the protean frame always aligns with the flow direction as per ( [ eqn : qrotn ] ) . due to the temporal derivative in the reoriented jacobian ( [ eqn : aaux ] ) for the qr decomposition method , solutions to @xmath174 which render @xmath179 upper triangular",
    "are not unique .",
    "whilst @xmath174 asymptotically converges to the protean coordinate frame ( due to the dissipative nature of ( [ eqn : qraux ] ) ) , for finite times the continuous qr method does not align with the streamlines of the flow and hence inferences regarding topological and kinematic constraints upon the dynamics do not universally hold .",
    "moreover , for 2d steady flows ( and analogous dynamical systems ) , the protean transform provides a simple closed solution ( [ eqn : qrotn ] ) for @xmath59 , hence it is not necessary to explicitly solve the ode system ( [ eqn : qraux ] ) or employ unitary integration routines  @xcite to preserve orthogonality of @xmath174 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , all 3d zero helicity density flows may be posed in the form of an isotropic darcy flow @xmath180 where @xmath12 is the flow potential , @xmath9 the streamfunction and @xmath181 is a scalar , with @xmath182 .",
    "the streamsurfaces of constant @xmath9 are the lamb surfaces of the flow , material surfaces which are spanned by both the velocity and vorticity vectors .",
    "such zero helicity density flows admit an orthogonal material coordinate system which aligns with the stream lines , vorticity lines and lamb vector field lines of the flow . in this frame",
    "the velocity gradient tensor @xmath167 takes on a particularly simple form , and so for zero helicity density flows we define this material frame as the protean coordinate system .",
    "the covariant base vectors @xmath183 of this material coordinate system are then given by the normalised velocity , vorticity and lamb vectors respectively as @xmath184 under this formulation the isopotential , stream and lamb surfaces ( respectively @xmath12=const .",

    "are all orthogonal and are normal to @xmath113 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 respectively .",
    "the orthogonal coordinates of the material coordinate system are then @xmath189 where @xmath190 denote the distance along the coordinate @xmath191 .",
    "the differential arc length @xmath192 then satisfies @xmath193 , and the metric tensor for the orthogonal coordinate system is then @xmath194 note that as the components of the covariant @xmath195 and contravariant @xmath196 metric tensors transform as @xmath197 and as @xmath198 , then the scale factors @xmath199 are then @xmath200 from the isotropic darcy equation ( [ eqn : darcycross ] ) and coordinate definitions ( [ eqn : xi1])-([eqn : xi3 ] ) these scale factors are explicitly @xmath201 where the local density of lamb surfaces is defined as @xmath202 following batchelor ( 1967 ) , the components of the velocity gradient tensor @xmath67 are then @xmath203 hence the velocity gradient is upper triangular , and the @xmath139 components fully decouple as @xmath204 where @xmath205 and the longitudinal shear rate @xmath206 and vorticity @xmath207 are respectively @xmath208 hence fluid deformation in 3d steady flows with zero helicity density evolve in a similar manner to 2d steady flow due to longitudinal shear and vorticity within lamb surfaces and stream surfaces . as these surfaces are material ,",
