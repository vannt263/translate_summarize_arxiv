    "the unusual transport properties in the normal state of the cuprates continue to attract widespread interest .",

    "both the resistivity and inverse hall angle show a rather simple matthiessen s rule  @xcite , suggestive of additive scattering mechanisms . however ,",
    "their temperature dependences differ significantly .",
    "this has led to the suggestion that the resistivity and the inverse hall angle are controlled by very different scattering rates ( the so - called ` two - lifetime ' behavior )  @xcite .",
    "this view seems to be confirmed by optical measurements  @xcite which suggest two independent scattering rates in these materials .",
    "the magnetoresistance does not follow kohler scaling behavior but appears also to be controlled by the hall angle scattering rate  @xcite .",
    "attempts to understand this behavior may be divided into three categories .",
    "anderson  @xcite has argued that a non - fermi liquid description must be invoked to understand transport in the cuprates . in anderson",
    "s picture the electron decays into holons and spinons which separately control resistivity and magneto - transport respectively .",
    "a phenomenological transport equation was introduced by coleman , schofield and tsvelik  @xcite to capture a model of transport where the two lifetimes are controlled by independent fluids of particles .",
    "a second approach argues that the magnetic field plays a special role in the transport process . in the model of kotliar , sengupta and varma  @xcite a singular skew scattering term",
    "is invoked . in the picture by lee and lee",
    "@xcite only recombined slave - fermion and slave - boson particles can interact with the true applied magnetic field .",
    "the slave particles themselves are insensitive to the true field because of the large fluctuations in the fictitious gauge field . in both of these scenarios",
    "the measured cyclotron frequency would appear to be temperature dependent  a result at odds with current optical hall experiments  @xcite .    the third possibility ",
    "the ` anisotropic scattering ' scenario  envisages a conventional metallic state characterized by an electron quasiparticle scattering rate which depends strongly on the particle momentum .",
    "this picture was first suggested by cooper  @xcite and has been further elaborated upon by stojkovi and pines  @xcite , and also by yakovenko and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "_ argue that antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the normal state strongly scatter regions on the fermi surface which are connected by the antiferromagnetic wave vector .",
    "regions away from these ` hot - spots ' are weakly scattered .",
    "however , hlubina and rice  @xcite have claimed that the cold regions would tend to ` short - circuit ' the hot spots , thereby leading to conventional transport at low temperatures .",
    "ioffe and millis  @xcite have introduced a new variant on the anisotropic scattering picture which is partly motivated by the short - circuiting problem and also inspired by the direct measurements of electron lifetimes .",
    "they use angle - resolved photoemission data to argue that quasiparticles are very strongly scattered over most of the fermi surface .",
    "the only long - lived quasiparticles are found at the zone diagonals , where they decay with a weak @xmath1 fermi liquid form .",
    "this is known as the ` cold spot ' model and has been used to understand a wide variety of experiments ( see for example van der marel  @xcite and xiang and hardy  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider this third scenario of anisotropic scattering and treat a minimal model which we believe is illustrative of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach ( similar in spirit to some treatments of the cuprate superconducting state  @xcite ) . whilst more sophisticated treatments exist , either with a specific relaxation mechanism  @xcite or in the limit of extremely anisotropic in - plane scattering  @xcite , there are advantages to this model s simplicity .",
    "we can obtain analytic expressions for a wide range of transport properties over the full range of anisotropy .",
    "our calculations illustrate the conclusions of ioffe and millis in the limit of strong anisotropy , but also allow us to see how this evolves from the more familiar isotropic metal .",
    "this is important as the approach to the isotropic limit may be more relevant to experiments on overdoped materials where the two - lifetime behavior is less apparent .",
    "we also consider the transition to the intermediate and high field regimes of magnetoresistance within this picture , and non - linear effects at high electric field .",
    "perhaps the key discrepancy between the ` cold - spot ' model and the transport properties of the cuprates is the in - plane orbital magnetoresistance .",
    "the model predicts a large magnetoresistance with a distinct temperature dependence in contrast with current experiments .",
    "this was was noted in ioffe and millis original paper  @xcite and is reproduced in passing here .",
    "it has been argued that proper inclusion of vertex corrections could account for this discrepancy  @xcite .",
    "the most important new work in this paper is to consider the orbital magnetoresistance for currents moving along the @xmath0-axis .",
    "the @xmath0-axis conductivity in a quasi - two dimensional metal may be computed _ without _ vertex corrections  @xcite and so should be a robust feature of this scenario .",
    "we show how an in - plane magnetic field affects the @xmath0-axis conductivity and argue that this experimental geometry provides a key test of the model .",
    "indeed experiments exist on tl-2201  @xcite but only in the overdoped regime where the two lifetimes become less distinct .",
    "nevertheless our complete solution of an anisotropic scattering model allows us to obtain a reasonable fit to the data provided we include both scattering anisotropy and bandstructure effects .",
    "our main conclusions are that within our model the in - plane magnetoresistance remains an outstanding problem if this model is to fit the experiment  not just from its magnitude and temperature dependence but from the scale at which deviations from the weak - field regime occur .",
    "while a proper treatment of vertex corrections may correct this for in - plane properties , the @xmath0-axis magnetoresistance is insensitive to these corrections and provides a robust test of the model .",
    "experiments here have mainly been done on overdoped cuprates and our detailed fit to experiments are consistent with this model .",
    "high field @xmath0-axis measurements on optimally doped cuprates should be made to test unambiguously this transport phenomenology .",
    "this paper is planned as follows . in section  [ aniso ]",
    "we present our models of scattering and bandstructure which are the ingredients for the analytic calculation of transport properties .",
    "the results are to be found in section  [ results ] .",
    "these are displayed in the general case , and also in the limit of large scattering anisotropy .",
    "both in - plane and out - of - plane magnetoresistivity are shown , and compared with experimental observations in section [ application ] .",
    "non - ohmic in - plane conductivity is also calculated .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "our main assumption in this work is to use a boltzmann equation within the relaxation time approximation as a description of transport .",
    "we write the collision integral , @xmath2 $ ] , as @xmath3 $ ] and impose a phenomenological scattering rate , @xmath4 , which varies smoothly around the in - plane fermi surface and has square symmetry .",
    "we do not speculate on the underlying cause of the quasiparticle relaxation rate but , if this scattering were due to scattering from a soft bosonic mode at finite @xmath5 ( antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations for example ) , then the validity of the relaxation time approximation might be questionable  @xcite .",
    "this is because such scattering would tend to equilibrate quasiparticles only between points on the fermi surface connected by the spanning vector ( @xmath5 ) of the mode .",
    "by contrast , the relaxation time approximation assumes that the quasiparticle is equilibrated uniformly around the fermi surface .",
    "this will not affect our calculation of c - axis response if the bosonic mode is 2-dimensional , but it could change the in - plane physics .",
    "this is presumably the reason why vertex corrections could be important for in - plane transport . however , including this process correctly would tend to make the quasiparticle distribution even more anisotropic when driven out of equilibrium .",
    "as we will see , the anisotropy of the out - of - equilibrium distribution of quasiparticles is precisely what is probed by the in - plane magnetoresistance .",
    "increasing this anisotropy is likely to increase further the in - plane magnetoresistance .    within the relaxation time approximation",
    "we now introduce two forms of scattering rate to model the anisotropy .      following ioffe and millis  @xcite",
    ", the angle - resolved photoemission results suggest that there are points on the fermi surface where the electron is a fairly long - lived excitation : points where the fermi surface intersects the brillouin zone diagonal . elsewhere on the fermi surface ,",
    "only broad features in energy are seen in the photoemission . within a fermi liquid picture",
    "one would then infer that electron - like quasiparticles are strongly scattered everywhere except for these special points .",
    "we can capture this by the following form for our scattering rate @xmath6    here @xmath7 is the azimuthal angle between the in - plane momentum wavevector @xmath8 and the @xmath9-axis direction of the crystal , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "-axis dispersion greatly exaggerated .",
    "the degree to which the @xmath0-axis dispersion depends on the in - plane momentum varies within this model from ( a ) no dependence ( @xmath10 ) to ( b ) the case when there is no dispersion along the zone diagonals ( @xmath11 ) . ]",
    "this is a simple model which nevertheless allows us to explore the transition from isotropic ( @xmath12 ) to extremely anisotropic scattering ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the latter limit corresponds to the case studied by ioffe and millis , where , at the planar zone diagonals [ @xmath14 the scattering rate has a minimum . in their model",
    ", @xmath15 is just the fermi - liquid scattering rate , @xmath16 . the scattering around the fermi - surface in the limit of strong anisotropy is illustrated in fig .  [ figure2 ] .    ) and the hot - spot model ( solid line and eq .",
    "[ hotrate ] ) .",
    "although the current is preferentially carried by the longest - lived quasiparticle , in the cold - spot model the short - lived particles can contribute since they cover most of the fermi line . in the hot - spot model the cold regions short circuit all transport processes and dominate all quantities . ]    it will often be convenient to express the scattering rate in terms of an anisotropy parameter , @xmath17 , where eq .",
    "[ scatrate1 ] is written as @xmath18 with @xmath19 in this form @xmath20 gives us the isotropic scattering case whilst @xmath21 or @xmath22 gives large anisotropy with cold spots on the zone diagonals or zone axes respectively .",
    "we will express results in either notation ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) depending on applicability to available data and ease of interpretation , and are always able to calculate across the full range of @xmath17 .",
    "alternatively it is has been proposed that hot spots exist near the @xmath25 points of the brillouin zone where strong scattering occurs , perhaps due to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "this leaves quasiparticles on the rest of the fermi surface with a longer lifetime . to capture this within our phenomenology",
    "we add the scattering lifetimes around the fermi surface so @xmath26 here we expect @xmath27 to be smaller than @xmath28 so that we have a model with strong - scattering hot spots and extended cold regions with less scattering ( see fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) .",
    "the next component of the model is the bandstructure .",
    "we assume that the in - plane dispersion is isotropic , which is not unreasonable for the cuprates .",
    "by contrast the dispersion in the out - of - plane direction is known to have significant dependence on the in - plane momentum  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the local chemistry of the copper - oxide planes as emphasized by xiang  @xcite .",
    "transport between planes occurs principally through the copper 4s orbitals . since these orbitals are circularly symmetric in the plane , their overlap amplitude with the cu 3d@xmath29o 2p hybrids has d - wave symmetry as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .     and oxygen 2p orbitals and a copper 4s has d - wave symmetry .",
    "since transport between layers occurs primarily via the copper 4s orbitals , the @xmath0-axis tunneling probability vanishes when the in - plane quasiparticle momentum is directed along the zone diagonals ",
    "the zeros of the @xmath30 form ( after xiang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . ]",
    "the resulting tunneling term is therefore proportional to the square of this amplitude and can be represented by the form @xmath31 .",
    "the most important effect this has on @xmath0-axis transport stems from the fact that the longest - lived quasiparticles on the zone diagonals are precisely those that have a vanishing probability of @xmath0-axis hopping .",
    "for this reason we ignore other features of the @xmath0-axis dispersion which may lead to additional small tunneling probabilities at other points on the fermi - surface such as those due to a body - centered tetragonal unit cell considered elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "our bandstructure is then given by    @xmath32    to illustrate the importance of this effect and to allow for other tunneling mechanisms we parameterize the degree of tunneling anisotropy by @xmath33 , which we allow to vary from 0 to 1 .",
    "when @xmath33=1 , we have complete elimination of c - axis transport for quasiparticles with in - plane momentum along the zone diagonals .",
    "the frequency dependence of this end - point of the model has been studied by van der marel  @xcite .",
    "allowing both the degree of scattering anisotropy ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath0-axis dispersion ( @xmath33 ) to vary across their full range turns out to be crucial in understanding the out - of - plane transport and is a novel aspect of this work .",
    "it unifies various other approaches  @xcite which focus on the extremes of one or other of the ranges of @xmath17 and @xmath33 .",
    "using the standard representation of the quasiparticle distribution , @xmath34 , we write the boltzmann equation ( for uniform fields and temperature gradients ) as  @xcite @xmath35 we will solve this equation in various limits in the subsequent sections",
    ". we will only be interested in d.c .",
    "properties in this paper , however our results for the cold - spot model ( eq .  [ coldrate ] ) are easily extended into the frequency domain .",
    "after fourier transforming with respect to time , we see that @xmath36 we can therefore obtain the finite frequency results for the cold - spot model from our expressions at d.c . simply by the prescription @xmath37",

    "we expand @xmath44 and @xmath45 to order @xmath46 and the resistivity is then found by simple matrix inversion .    if we consider first hot - spot scattering ( eq .  [ hotrate ] ) , we can see that this scattering rate can be eliminated as a viable model for the cuprates .",

    "is now solved by jones - zener expansion in @xmath56 and is given by @xmath57 from the 4-fold symmetry of the system , it is straightforward to deduce that the currents in the @xmath58 and @xmath59 directions must have the following form at third order in the electric field : @xmath60 we then find that @xmath61 which all simplify or reduce to zero appropriately in the isotropic limit , @xmath62 . furthermore , in the limit of strong anisotropy , @xmath63 , we find @xmath64 , as demonstrated by hlubina  @xcite .",
    "the most obvious consequence of non - linear response in the electric field is that the current no longer flows parallel to the electric field . defining the parallel current ( @xmath65 ) as being the response parallel to the applied field , and the transverse current",

    "[ nonohm1 ] and  [ nonohm2 ] ) we may write @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the drude drift velocity of a fast decaying quasiparticle .",
    "so , although the @xmath73 is generally tiny , nonlinear effects are indeed strongly enhanced by anisotropy .      in this treatment",
    "we have not speculated on the anisotropy of the energy relaxation rate around the fermi surface . however",
    "if we make the assumption that the energy relaxation follows the quasiparticle relaxation rate and only varies around the fermi surface ( as opposed to variations away from the fermi surface ) we can calculate all of the thermal transport coefficients . without reproducing the details of the calculation we can see immediately from the form of the boltzmann equation ( eq .  [ simpleboltz ] ) that temperature gradients drive the quasiparticle distribution in exactly the same way as electric fields except for the usual factor of @xmath74 .",
    "this is seen in the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "[ simpleboltz ] .",
    "this factor is isotropic around the fermi surface and does not introduce any further angular dependence . thus we can conclude that all currents proportional to temperature gradients will have exactly the same dependence on scattering rate as those driven by electric fields ( for example @xmath75 in the absence of a magnetic field ) . within this approximation",
    "the thermal conductivity will obey the wiedemann - franz law and the diffusion thermopower will have the usual linear temperature dependence and be independent of the scattering rate . to account for the unusual systematics in the measured thermopower of the cuprate metals  @xcite in this model one would need to add a significant anisotropic energy dependence of the scattering rate that differs from the anisotropy of the transport relaxation rate .",
    "in order to apply the analytic results of our model to experimental data , we have made a comparison of magnetoresistivity results with measurements on overdoped samples of single - crystal tl@xmath76ba@xmath76cuo@xmath77 , made by tyler  @xcite and hussey  @xcite .",
    "we choose this system because its @xmath0-axis magnetoresistance is well characterized .",
    "we have argued that @xmath0-axis properties are the most robust quantities in this model since they are not affected by vertex corrections , nor do they rely on a quasiparticle picture .",
    "we then identify combinations of measured @xmath0-axis quantities which directly probe the degree of anisotropy with minimal dependence on unknown parameters .",
    "finally we address the in - plane transport features .",
    "we also identify combinations of experimental quantities which allow a comparison with theory involving the fewest assumptions on unknown parameters .",
    "in particular we can constrain the degree of anisotropy in the @xmath0-axis dispersion ( @xmath33 ) and the range of scattering anisotropy ( @xmath17 ) from the @xmath0-axis magnetoresistance .",
    "first we consider the overall magnitude of the fourth order magnetoresistance by comparing this to the second order term .",
    "this is shown in fig .  [ figure5](b ) .",
    "when we compare this to our model [ fig .",
    "[ figure5](a ) ] we see that to obtain the observation of an essentially temperature independent result of around 0.6 , the degree of scattering anisotropy must be limited to @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath17 is to have any temperature dependence at all then @xmath33 should be approaching 1 where the gradients in fig .",
    "[ figure5](a ) are smallest .    we have already remarked on a second conclusion from a comparison between theory and experiment . in order for the maxima in the @xmath0-axis magnetoresistance to occur when the field is along the zone - diagonals , @xmath0-axis transport along these directions must be suppressed .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure6](a ) where we see that with @xmath79 we require @xmath80 to obtain a ratio of @xmath81 of the correct sign . furthermore the experimental bounds on this ratio [ illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure6](b ) ] confirm that the degree of scattering anisotropy ( @xmath17 ) must be less than about 0.6 . in no sense",
    "then are we in the limit of strong anisotropy in this overdoped material .",
    "a further observation comes from the temperature dependence shown in fig .",
    "[ figure6](b ) . generically the quantities shown in figs .  [ figure5](b ) and",
    "[ figure6](b ) should be temperature dependent so the observation that only the second of these has any significant variation with temperature restricts @xmath17 to vary between about 0.2 and 0.4 with a band structure anisotropy @xmath82 .",
    "also , in order to fit the trends in the data , we see that the overdoped state must become less anisotropic as the temperature is lowered .",
    "proximity to a zero temperature critical point would suggest the opposite should be true but perhaps here elastic processes are begining to dominate .    in order to predict other experimental quantities",
    ", we then need to know the temperature dependence of @xmath83 .",
    "this too can be found from the second order c - axis magnetoresistance , when data is compared with the functional form in table [ rhoctable ] , here fixing @xmath11 .",
    "in addition it can also be independently infered from the in - plane resistivity but now relying on the assumptions of boltzman transport theory .    with these two temperature dependencies",
    "known , we may try to predict in - plane properties .",
    "we show plots of the cotangent of the hall angle , @xmath84 , and the in - plane magnetoresistance @xmath85 , together with experimental data from hussey and tyler in figs .",
    "[ figure7 ] and  [ figure8 ] .",
    "we see by comparing the experimental data with the parameters extracted from other measurements that the data and theory follow the same trends and are of the correct order of magnitudes .",
    "the two different fits on each plot represent the two different methods of infering @xmath86 : either using the in - plane resistivity or the out - of - plane magnetoresistance .",
    "the difference in these two methods is that the in - plane measurements would be expected to be sensitive to the transport lifetime , as opposed to the quasiparticle lifetime in the case of out - of - plane measurements .",
    "surprisingly it appears that the quasiparticle lifetime is longer than the transport lifetime .     with experimental data  @xcite from measurements on tl@xmath76ba@xmath76cuo@xmath77 .",

    ". these effects should be measurable but again rely on using in - plane transport lifetimes to provide a measure of in - plane quasiparticle lifetimes .",
    "however , we can make an unambiguous prediction within this model : that the positions of the maxima in resistivity at fourth order should move from the [ 110 ] directions ( seen in the overdoped system ) to the [ 100 ] directions in the optimally doped materials .",

    "<S> a simple model of anisotropic scattering in a quasi two - dimensional metal is studied . </S>",
    "<S> its simplicity allows an analytic calculation of transport properties using the boltzmann equation and relaxation time approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the @xmath0-axis magnetoresistance provides the key test of this model of transport . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this model with experiments on overdoped tl-2201 and find reasonable agreement using only weak scattering anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that optimally doped tl-2201 should show strong angular - dependent magnetoresistance within this model and would provide a robust way of determining the in - plane scattering anisotropy in the cuprates . </S>"
