    "electron - phonon interactions ( epi ) are at the heart of the pairing mechanism in the bcs theory @xcite that successfully describes traditional superconductors .",
    "it is believed , however , that epi can not produce the high critical temperatures observed in cuprate superconductors and , for this reason , most of the research in the field has focused on the interaction between charge and magnetic degrees of freedom as a source of the pairing mechanism in the cuprates.@xcite    despite almost 20 years of intensive research , the pairing mechanism in the cuprates is still unknown . the experimental evidence indicating that phonons and lattice degrees of freedom play an active role in these materials keeps mounting.@xcite in addition , inhomogeneous structures described as stripes , patches , tiles , etc .",
    ", have been detected in the underdoped regime of several cuprates.@xcite the emerging phase complexity is reminiscent of the experimental data for manganites where competing electronic , magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom are responsible for the rich phase structure.@xcite it is also likely that the strong electronic correlations present in these materials , in particular the proximity to a mott insulating phase in the cuprates , could radically change the effects of epi with respect to those in conventional metals and superconductors .",
    "most theoretical efforts that tried to incorporate epi in models for the cuprates were performed in the 90 s and they focused on whether the interactions could produce d - wave pairing ( instead of s - wave)@xcite , and on the tendency of phonons towards the stabilization of charge density wave ( cdw ) states that could compete with superconductivity ( sc ) . in order to observe cdw states most of these calculations",
    "were performed at quarter filling.@xcite currently , our aim is to understand whether epi stabilize or destabilize charge stripes , and what kind of inhomogeneous textures , if any , develop . instead of focusing on the phonons as an alternative source of the pairing mechanism we want to explore whether the interplay of magnetic and phonon interactions with the electrons may lead to an enhancement of the pairing already observed in purely electronic models of high t@xmath0 superconductors.@xcite    in the early studies only diagonal epi were considered and the effects on hopping terms and heisenberg coupling due to the lattice distortions ( off - diagonal terms ) were disregarded .",
    "most of the numerical work was performed with on - site holstein phonons , and when more extended modes were considered the focus was on breathing modes@xcite that would tend to stabilize cdw states and in buckling modes that were known to produce the tilting of the octahedra in ybco.@xcite at present , the experimental evidence indicates that the electron - phonon coupling to the breathing mode is strongly anisotropic and , as a result , half - breathing modes seem to have the strongest epi in the high tc cuprates.@xcite in addition , some authors believe that off - diagonal couplings could be stronger than the diagonal ones.@xcite    most of the recent studies of epi in models for the cuprates have been performed using mean - field , slave - boson , or lda approximations.@xcite here , we propose to revisit the t - j model and study the effects of epi with unbiased numerical techniques . in order to find the relevant phononic modes we will start by studying adiabatic phonons , i.e. @xmath1 .",

    "the off - diagonal epi breaks the degeneracy in momentum and selects de ground state with momentum @xmath40 .",

    "the peaks at momentum @xmath56 ( squares ) and @xmath50 ( diamonds ) in the magnetic structure factor remains essentially unchanged as well .",
    "while this happens the pairing correlations and the average number of phonons decrease slightly ( fig .",
    "this trend continues up to @xmath122 . beyond this value , there are no indications of the formation of a charge inhomogeneity but there are some changes in the magnetic channel with an incipient order with momentum @xmath123 .",
    "we will also study the effects of off - diagonal interactions for @xmath124 , i.e. , in the region with dynamical stripes .",
    "the effect of @xmath22 in this case is to select the state with momentum ( 0,0 ) as the ground state . at @xmath121 the ground state",
    "presents a charge inhomogeneous state with two stripes according to the large peak at @xmath39 in @xmath36 ( circles in fig .",

    "once this incommensurability has disappeared , a second level crossing takes place at @xmath128 and the ground state momentum is again @xmath129 . by further increasing @xmath22 ,",
    "the charge ordering is reestablished .",
    "this complex behavior , together with the one previously found for @xmath120 , illustrates the interplay between the diagonal and off - diagonal epi . in particular , due to a nonzero @xmath23 ,",
    "the spin degrees of freedom are now directly coupled to the ion displacements , and hence magnetic orderings are more relevant to the overall behavior than with purely diagonal epi .    for completeness",
    "we are going to comment on the effects of the diagonal electron - phonon coupling to buckling modes with quantum phonons .",
    "our studies with adiabatic phonons showed that in a very narrow region of parameter space stripes were stabilized by a buckling mode that breaks rotational invariance .",
    "the mode that stabilizes vertical stripes would have a maximum coupling constant at momentum @xmath39 . selecting this momentum in eq.(12 )",
    "( with the plus sign ) we arrive to the same hamiltonian as in the half - breathing case , except that the single phonon modes are now along the @xmath46 direction ( parallel to the stripe ) rather that in the direction @xmath45 as in the half - breathing case , in agreement with the results obtained in the adiabatic case ( fig .",
    "in addition , off - diagonal effects vanish in this case .",
    "thus , the same physical properties as in the diagonal half - breathing case are obtained .    in ref .",
    "it was shown at the mean - field level that a diagonal coupling was sufficient to enhance d - wave pairing correlations . selecting the plus sign in eq.(12 )",
    "we observe that the effective coupling constant is maximum for @xmath38 and vanishes at momentum @xmath56 in agreement with the result of nazarenko et al.@xcite .",
    "regretfully keeping only momentum @xmath38 in eq.(12 ) leads to @xmath130 and @xmath131 which does not couple the electrons to the phonons since the number of electrons is fixed in our simulations and @xmath132 is constant for all states .",
    "a study of this case conserving more than two phonon modes would be desirable since mean field calculations @xcite and results for 2 holes doping obtained with a truncated approach@xcite provided encouraging results towards d - wave pairing stabilization .",
    "summarizing , we have studied the effects of electron - phonon interactions in the t - j model for a variety of phononic modes , couplings , and electronic densities using small clusters solved exactly .",
    "the most remarkable result is that charge inhomogeneous states with mobile holes are stabilized by these interactions . in particular , stripe states which are very difficult to stabilize in the t - j model",
    "are clearly observed .",
    "tile structures , detected experimentally in some cuprates , are stabilized for the first time in the t - j model .",
    "our calculations also confirm that the half - breathing mode that stabilizes the stripes is the most energetically favorable in some regions of parameter space .",
    "we have also found that buckling modes can generate stripe and tile states in a very narrow range of electron - phonon coupling constants .",
    "thus , this mode also has to be considered in the interpretation of experimental data .",
    "the pairing correlations vanish in the regime of localized holes induced by the epi but it is encouraging that not drastic effects occur in the states with mobile holes .",
    "in fact , small enhancements have been detected in some cases .",
    "this should be contrasted with the pair breaking effects of the full breathing mode in d - wave superconductors .",
    "as previously observed in the context of the spin - fermion model @xcite and diagramatic calculations , @xcite diagonal epi induce charge localization while off - diagonal epi encourages hole mobility .",
