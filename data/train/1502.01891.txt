    "in this paper , we consider a reaction - diffusion equation that includes discontinuous two - state two - threshold relay operators . this equation was proposed as a model for dynamics of a population of bacteria that can switch their phenotype in response to changes of the environment @xcite .",
    "the model exhibits formation of patterns in the space of distributions of the two phenotypes over an admissible range of the switching thresholds .",
    "the convergence of solutions to a stationary pattern observed numerically in @xcite was proved in @xcite .",
    "the objective of this work is to obtain asymptotic formulas for the pattern and the timing of its formation under the assumption of slow diffusion .",
    "the model includes several time scales .",
    "the `` spatial '' variable is a scalar parameter @xmath0 that measures the distance between the switching thresholds of a bacterium and characterizes its switching strategy ( the smaller the @xmath0 the more responsive is the strategy to variations of the environmental conditions ) . that is , a solution describes the evolution of the distribution of each of the two phenotypes over possible switching strategies parameterized by @xmath0 .",
    "the diffusion of this distribution models sporadic changes of the switching strategy by individual organisms ; it is assumed to be slow compared to the rate of growth and competition precesses .",
    "the rate of transition from one phenotype to the other in bacteria is assumed to be much higher than the rate of other processes .",
    "every such transition is modeled by an instantaneous switch of a relay from state @xmath1 to state @xmath2 or vice versa ( where each state represents a particular phenotype ) .",
    "the central assumption that we make is that the switching threshold for the transition of a relay ( bacterium ) from state @xmath1 to state @xmath2 is different from the switching threshold for the opposite transition ( the difference of the thresholds @xmath3 is called the bi - stability range ) .",
    "that is , we assume hysteresis , or multi - stability , in the switching response of bacteria to the exogenous stimulus .",
    "this hysteresis can be viewed as form of the persistent memory of past environmental conditions by organisms . since the seminal work of max delbrk @xcite , epigenetic differences arising in the process of cell differentiation have been attributed to multi - stability of living forms .",
    "a classical example of such multi - stability is the behavior of _ lac - operon _ in _",
    "e.  coli _",
    "( _ lac - operon _ is a collection of genes associated with transport and metabolism of lactose in the bacterium ; expression of these genes can be turned on by molecules called inducers ) .",
    "experimental studies of the regulation of enzymes in _",
    "e.  coli _ and yeast that were conducted as early as in the 1950 - 60 s effectively demonstrated that two phenotypes each associated with `` on '' and `` off '' state of _ lac - operon _ expression can be obtained from the same culture .",
    "the fraction of each phenotype in the total population depended on the history of exposure to the inducer , and each phenotype remained stable through multiple generations of the bacteria @xcite .",
    "this behavior resembles the two - threshold hysteretic relay shown in fig .",
    "[ hyst ] . later , multi - stable gene expression and hysteresis have been well - documented in many natural as well as artificially constructed systems @xcite . in particular",
    ", recent experiments using molecular biology methods permitted a further study of the region of bi - stability of the _ lac - operon _ when multiple input variables are used to switch the _ lac - operon _ genes on and off .    a substantial amount of experimental and theoretical work provides an evidence that organisms use various ( often randomized ) strategies of phenotype switching in order to adapt to changing environmental conditions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is intuitively clear that phenotypic diversity within the population can help to increase the chances of survival in varying environment .",
    "switching strategies that establish phenotypic diversity are called bet - hedging @xcite . indeed ,",
    "experimental and theoretical models of adaptation demonstrate that bet - hedging can evolve to maximize the net growth of the total population @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a simple differential model was used to show that switching strategies with two thresholds where the switching moment depends not only on the state of the environment , but also on the phenotype itself , can further increase darwinian fitness of species .",
    "these strategies exploit hysteresis and are described by a two - threshold relay shown in fig .",
    "[ hyst ] in the adiabatic limit when switching is faster than the characteristic rate of the environment variations .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that the optimal bi - stability range , that is the optimal separation of thresholds @xmath3 of the relay , which maximizes the net growth rate of the population is different for different environmental inputs .",
    "for this reason , the model that is considered in this work includes the distribution of bacteria ( relays ) over a set of switching strategies which have different separation of switching thresholds with @xmath0 taking the values from an interval @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the diffusion process included in the model acts as a factor that diversifies the switching thresholds ( strategies ) in the population , while the competition provides a mechanism of selection that may favor a subpopulation with a specific @xmath0 for a given law of variation of the state of environment .",
    "more detailed discussion of the model assumptions and the biological background can be found in @xcite .",
    "parabolic equations with distributed non - ideal relays were previously used for modeling spatial structures that were observed in spatially distributed colonies of bacteria , for example concentric rings in petri dish experiments @xcite . in these models ,",
    "all the relays have the same fixed separation of thresholds .",
    "the mechanism of pattern formation discussed in this work is based on the long - term memory of the hysteretic relays and is related to dynamics of free boundary separating the domain where relays are in state @xmath1 from the domain where relays are in state @xmath2 on the interval @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "this mechanism is different from the mechanism found in @xcite .",
    "other important aspects of dynamics of parabolic and hyperbolic differential equations with distributed relays were studied in @xcite in relation to multiple applied problems ( not related to patterns ) such as phase transitions , population dynamics , multi - phase flows in porous media , thermostat control and others .    in the following sections 2 and 3 we present the model and a statement on its well - posedness that has been obtained earlier .",
    "section 4 contains the main statement on the asymptotics of the patterns and its proof .",
    "in this paper , we consider a class of models , which attempt to account for a number of phenomena , namely ( a ) switching of bacteria between two phenotypes ( states ) in response to variations of environmental conditions ; ( b ) hysteretic switching strategy ( switching rules ) associated with bi - stability of phenotype states ; ( c ) heterogeneity of the population in the form of a distribution of switching thresholds ; ( d ) bet - hedging in the form of diffusion between subpopulations characterized by different bi - stability ranges ; and , ( e ) competition for nutrients .",
    "the resulting model is a reaction - diffusion system including , as reaction terms , discontinuous hysteresis relay operators and the integral of those .",
    "this integral can be interpreted as the preisach operator  @xcite with a time dependent density ( the density is a component of the solution describing the varying distribution of bacteria ) . in  @xcite",
    ", we have shown that fitness , competition and diffusion can act together to select a nontrivial distribution of phenotypes ( states ) over the population of thresholds .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to give a quantative description of this distribution for small diffusion .",
    "we assume that each of the two phenotypes , denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , consumes a different type of nutrient ( for example , one consumes lactose and the other glucose ) . the amount of nutrient available for phenotype @xmath5 at the moment @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "the model is based on the following assumptions ( see  @xcite for further discussion ) .    1 .",
    "each bacterium changes phenotype in response to the variations of the variable @xmath9 , which measures the deviation of the relative concentration of the first nutrient from the value 1/2 in the mixture of the two nutrients .",
    "the input @xmath10 is mapped to the ( binary ) phenotype ( state ) of a bacterium @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the non - ideal relay operator with symmetric switching thresholds @xmath0 , @xmath13 with @xmath14 ; see fig .",
    "[ hyst ] and the rigorous definition   in section  [ secsetting ] .",
    "the population includes bacteria with different bi - stability ranges @xmath15 , where the threshold value @xmath0 varies over an interval @xmath16\\subset ( 0,1/2)$ ] .",
    "we will denote by @xmath17 the density of the biomass of bacteria with given switching thresholds @xmath18 at a moment @xmath6 .",
    "4 .   there is a diffusion process acting on the density @xmath19 .",
    "5 .   at any particular time moment @xmath6 , for any given @xmath0 , all the bacteria with the switching threshold values @xmath18 are in the same state ( phenotype ) .",
    "that is , @xmath17 is the total density of bacteria with the threshold @xmath0 at the moment @xmath6 and they are all in the same state .",
    "this means that when a bacterium with a threshold @xmath20 sporadically changes its threshold to a different value @xmath0 , it simultaneously copies the state from other bacteria which have the threshold  @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , this may require a bacterium to change the state when its threshold changes .    with these assumptions ,",
    "we obtain the following model of the evolution of bacteria and nutrients , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the derivatives of the population density @xmath19 ;  @xmath24 is the diffusion coefficient ; dot denotes the derivative with respect to time ; and all the non - ideal relays @xmath12 , @xmath25 $ ] , have the same input @xmath9 .",
    "we additionally assume the growth rate @xmath26 based on the mass action law for bacteria in the phenotype @xmath8 .",
    "the rate of the consumption of nutrient in the equation for @xmath27 is proportional to the total biomass of bacteria in the phenotype @xmath5 , hence to the integral ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the lower and upper bounds on available threshold values , respectively .",
