    "it has long been recognized that production of @xmath1-bosons in hadronic collisions can provide new insights into the partonic structure of hadrons , with polarization observables being of particular interest . in this context the parity - odd longitudinal single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) in proton - proton scattering plays a very important role , both for leptonic as well as hadronic final states ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . a major aim of looking into this observable is to get new and complementary information on the quark helicity distributions inside the proton .    in the meantime ,",
    "also a few studies for @xmath1-production with transversely polarized protons are available  @xcite .",
    "these papers mainly focus on a particular parity - even transverse single spin effect in @xmath2 ( with a subsequent decay of the @xmath3 into a lepton pair ) that is related to the transverse momentum dependent sivers function @xmath4  @xcite in the polarized proton .",
    "such an observable could , in principle , be measured at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in brookhaven . in order to have clean access to transverse momentum dependent parton distributions ( tmds ) like the sivers function ,",
    "one has to reconstruct the @xmath1-boson in the experiment .",
    "however , what one measures is @xmath0 , and the detectors at rhic do not allow to fully determine the momentum of the @xmath1 .",
    "the kinematics for inclusive production of a single lepton in proton - proton collisions coincides with the one for inclusive production of a jet or a hadron , for which mostly collinear factorization is used in the literature . in this letter , we compute transverse spin observables for @xmath0 in the collinear twist-3 formalism at the level of born diagrams .",
    "the machinery of collinear twist-3 factorization was pioneered already in the early 1980 s  @xcite , and in the meantime frequently applied to transverse spin effects in hard semi - inclusive reactions ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if one of the protons in @xmath0 is transversely polarized , and the other is either unpolarized or longitudinally polarized , one can identify two parity - even and two parity - odd spin observables .",
    "we will discuss below that , in the collinear twist-3 approach , these four observables contain two specific twist-3 quark - gluon - quark correlation functions .",
    "one is the so - called etqs ( efremov - teryaev - qiu - sterman ) matrix element  @xcite , which is related to a particular moment of the transverse momentum dependent sivers function as shown in  @xcite .",
    "the second is related to the tmd @xmath5",

    "in addition to the analytical results , we provide numerical estimates for typical rhic kinematics @xmath6 .",
    "all the observables are peaked around @xmath7 , with @xmath8 representing the transverse momentum of the lepton and @xmath9 the @xmath1-boson mass . in each case",

    "we emphasize that measuring @xmath10 would provide a crucial test of our present understanding of transverse ssas in qcd .",
    "in particular , this means that such a measurement would test the same physics  the gluon exchange between the remnants of the hadrons and the active partons  which underlies the famous process - dependence of the sivers function and of related time - reversal odd parton distributions  @xcite . in other words , experimental results for @xmath10 in @xmath0 ,",
    "even if analyzed in terms of collinear parton correlators , would check a crucial ingredient of tmd - factorization  @xcite .",
    "such a check , in essence , can be considered to be as fundamental as measuring the sign of the sivers asymmetry in the drell - yan process .",
    "we start by fixing the kinematical variables for the process @xmath0 , and assign 4-momenta to the particles according to @xmath11 by means of these momenta we specify a coordinate system through @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 representing the transverse momentum of the jet ) , and @xmath15 .",

    "nevertheless , in this kinematical region we expect @xmath75 to be measurable . as discussed in the introduction , in this context it is important to recall that information on the sign of the asymmetry is already sufficient for a crucial test of our current understanding of transverse ssas .    in particular in the peak region , the asymmetry is larger for @xmath85-production ( @xmath91-production ) than for @xmath86-production , which is partly due to the rather large sivers function for @xmath92-quarks obtained in the fit of ref .",
    "the @xmath85-asymmetry and @xmath86-asymmetry come with opposite sign because the sivers function for @xmath93-quarks and @xmath92-quarks have an opposite sign .",

    "moreover , it is worthwhile to mention that the contributions from the antiquark sivers functions are not negligible in the backward region .",

    "nevertheless , the asymmetry should be within experimental reach . like in the case of the parity - even ssa ,",
    "also @xmath76 is almost entirely determined by the @xmath90-term in the 3rd line in  ( [ e : master ] ) .",
