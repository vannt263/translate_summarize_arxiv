    "x - rays are emitted from the inner accretion disks around both stellar - mass and supermassive black holes .",
    "this gives us our most effective probe to date of accretion physics close to black holes as well as the immediate environments of black holes .",
    "studies of x - ray spectral variability are a particularly powerful diagnostic . for example , combined spectral and timing analyses have led to the discovery of distinct hardness / flux states in x - ray binaries @xcite which almost certainly correspond to distinct accretion modes .",
    "spectral variability also facilitates the decomposition of a complex spectrum into physical components that would be degenerate in a single spectrum .",
    "detailed studies of long term ( year@xmath1 ) x - ray variability in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have been possible since the launch of the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) but a relatively small number of sources have been targeted for detailed study @xcite .",
    "these studies are crucially important as they probe timescales comparable to the viscous timescale on which the true mass accretion rate would be expected to vary .",
    "more typical x - ray observations of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) probe timescales of hours - to - days , characteristic of dynamical or thermal timescales but much shorter than the viscous timescales .",
    "long - term studies are also important for uncovering rare / transient phenomena that may give unique windows into the physics and structure of agn .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we report the discovery of an unusual pattern of x - ray variability in the nearby seyfert-1 galaxy fairall  9 ( @xmath2 ) using the long - term monitoring data from pointed _ rxte _ observations . rather than displaying the usual ",
    "flary \" lightcurve with a log - normal flux distribution @xcite , fairall  9 shows long - timescale modulations punctuated by strong and sudden _",
    "dips_. this behavior was apparent but not commented upon when the monitoring was first presented by @xcite . using the latest background models and calibration files , we analyze all available _ rxte _ data and confirm the presence of these dips in the _ rxte _ lightcurve . we discuss their possible origins , including the possibility that they correspond to eclipses of the x - ray source by clouds in the broad line region ( blr )",
    "alternatively , the dips may result from a genuine accretion disk instability , suggesting an interesting parallel between fairall  9 and broad line radio galaxies .",
    "the observations considered in this analysis are all those of fairall  9 with public _ rxte_/pca data , a total of 744 pointings spanning the period from late 1996 until early 2003 .",
    "this gives an average time resolution of about 4days with an average pointing length of 1.1 ks .",
    "only data from the top layer of proportional counter unit 2 were used .",
    "the data were reduced as outlined in @xcite , using heasoft 6.10 . for each pointing , we produce a background - subtracted pca spectrum using the appropriate epoch - dependent background / response files .",
    "the count rates quoted below were obtained from the spectra for each pointing .",
    "we do not consider any intra - pointing variability in this work .",
    "the long - term light curve in the 2 - 10kev and 10 - 20kev bands is plotted in figure  [ rates ] ( left ) .",
    "this light curve displays the unusual behavior already noted in the introduction ; long timescale flux modulations punctuated by short and intense dips .",
    "these dips consist of a rapid flux decline by a factor of 24 in 510 days and then a recovery to the pre - dip level with an entire dip - duration of 1020 days ( fig .",
    "[ rates ] right ) .",
    "the existence of these dips introduces a low - flux tail to the flux distribution , skewing it strongly away from log - normal ( fig .",
    "[ histogram ] ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "these unusual dips in fairall  9 have not been commented upon previously .    on longer timescales the source is experiencing a flux decline from early 1999 reaching its low in the fall of 2000 and then recovering to a higher flux value towards the middle of 2001 .",
    "there is clearly a greater propensity to dip during the lower - flux state .",
    "the average flux in 210kev for the object is @xmath3 .",
    "both the long term and short term variability seem to be of similar nature in the two different bands .",
    "in particular , while the dips are most clearly seen in the 210kev light curve due to the higher signal - to - noise , they are also present in the 1020kev light curve .          to further explore the nature of the variability ,",
    "we perform flux resolved spectroscopy .",
    "we choose to use the 25kev flux as our flux discriminator since this will be dominated by the primary power - law rather than a soft excess component or reflection .",
    "we define a  high state \" as @xmath4 and , by summing the data for all pointing which exceed this flux , form a  high state spectrum \" .",
    "similarly , we define a",
    " low state spectrum \" ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "a flux of @xmath6 in 25kev corresponds to a 210kev count rate of about 1.45 counts per second .",
    "dip state spectrum \" , with a dip defined as a count rate drop of a factor of 1.5 in 210kev , with respect to the rate right before the dip and the two pointings following the drop , is also defined .",
    "the pointings considered to be part of a dip were excluded from high and low states .",
    "previous studies have shown that , to first order , the spectrum can be well described by a continuum , originating from a comptonizing corona , and cold reflection .",
    "we model this scenario using the ` pexmon ` model @xcite , which consists of a power law continuum plus the cold reflection continuum and associated iron k@xmath7/k@xmath8 fluorescent lines ( with a self - consistent strength ) .",
    "the quality of the data does not allow constraints on all parameters in the model , therefore the abundances are assumed to be solar and the inclination of the reflector is fixed to 60degrees ( the most probable value , assuming a random orientation ) .",
    "we also include cold galactic absorption with a column density @xmath9 , modeled by ` tbnew ` a newer version of ` tbabs ` @xcite with cross sections set to ` vern ` and abundances set to ` wilm ` .",
    "table  [ spec ] shows the spectral fitting results for these three flux - sorted spectra .",
    "the spectra are well described by the model , see fig .",
    "[ spectral ] , except for the high state spectrum where a residual line in the iron k region remains .",
    "this feature can be modeled with an additional iron line at the redshift of fairall  9 , with an equivalent width of @xmath10ev .",
    "the uncertainties in the energy of this additional line span both neutral and h - like iron . beyond that required by the reflection component , an additional line with this strength is rejected by both the low - state and dip - state spectra .",
    "thus , it appears that the additional iron line component is exclusively displayed by the high state spectrum .",
    "we comment on the nature of this spectral feature in section  4 .    in agreement with previous studies of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. ,",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the continuum softens ( @xmath11 increases ) from the low- to the high - state ( fig .",
    "[ col ] ) .",
    "we also see a reflection fraction which is inversely proportional to the continuum flux ; i.e. , the x - ray reflection is consistent with being a constant flux contribution .",
    "the most obvious interpretation is that a significant component of the reflection is from a distant structure . given that the modulation betwen high- and low - flux states occurs on timescales of @xmath12year , we infer that the distant reflector is situated at least a light year from the central x - ray source .",
    "we note that x - ray reflection from the inner accretion disk is also expected to be present @xcite and , given the error bars on @xmath13 , its presence is consistent with these data .",

    ".spectral parameters for cold reflection fits , see text for details on the model set - up . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     although flux resolved spectroscopy is a powerful tool , it does not offer the possibility to study the actual spectral evolution in time .",
    "higher time resolution can be achieved by looking at x - ray flux - flux plots in different bands .",
    "figure  [ col ] shows the 25kev/510kev flux - flux plot ; a positive correlation is apparent , although it is clearly non - linear as can be seen by a comparison with a spectral variability model possessing a flux variable power law with a constant hard component ( i.e. constant cold reflection ) . at high fluxes ,",
    "the non - linearity appears dominated by a genuine softening of the primary continuum .",
    "this was already seen in earlier studies for fairall  9 and other seyfert  1 galaxies @xcite . at the lowest fluxes ( corresponding to the dip state )",
    "there is a change in the nature of this non - linearity , with the lowest few 25kev flux points having an almost constant 510kev flux .",
    "this signals a significant spectral hardening during the deepest parts of the ( 25kev ) dips . however , the spectrum is never dominated by reflection .",
    "we do note that this non - linearity calls into question the use of @xmath14-intercepts in extrapolated flux - flux diagrams to determine constant components in agn spectra ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "in this letter , we studied the x - ray variability of fairall  9 on timescales of a few days to five years . on the long timescales studied by the flux resolved spectroscopy , a significant fraction of the reflected x - rays appear to maintain a constant normalization , suggesting that potentially a significant fraction of the x - ray reflection might originate from a structure at least a light year across . the excess iron emission line ( above and beyond that associated with the reflected component ) in the high - state spectrum suggests that , in this state , there might be an appreciable increase in the amount of compton - thin material intercepting the primary x - ray continuum .",
    "this material must be out of our line of sight since we see no iron absorption edge in the high - state spectrum .",
    "a possible identification for these feature is iron line emission ( fluorescence or radiative recombination ) from a radiatively - driven disk wind that forms in the high - flux state .",
    "the spectral resolution of the pca prevents us from constraining the charge state of the additional iron line and hence the ionization state of this additional material .",
    "the most unusual finding is the discovery of strong and sudden dips in the observed x - ray flux from fairall  9 . in the rest of this section",
    ", we discuss the nature of these dips .",
    "there are two fundamentally different interpretations ; transient absorption events ( i.e. eclipses ) of the inner accretion disk , or a genuine turning - off of x - ray emission from the inner disk .",
    "we begin by addressing the absorption possibility . at least upon the immediate onset of a dip , both the 210kev and 1020kev fluxes drop by similar magnitudes requiring that the absorber be compton - thick ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "suppose that the radius of an absorbing  cloud \" has radius @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the gravitational radius ) and it is situated @xmath18 from the black hole .",
    "assuming keplerian motion , the velocity of the cloud is @xmath19 and hence the eclipse of the inner disk by the cloud with take a duration @xmath20 . for a black hole mass of @xmath21 @xcite ,",
    "this gives @xmath22 .",
    "the observed 210kev dips have duration @xmath23 , implying that @xmath24 . assuming that the x - ray source has a size of @xmath25 , we must have @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) in order for the cloud to be able to block the source and create a strong dip , implying @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the absorbing clouds are consistent with being at blr distances . for a cloud with radius @xmath30 to be compton - thick , it must have a density exceeding @xmath31 .",
    "thus , these absorbing clouds also have a density consistent with that of blr clouds ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* )    x - ray eclipses by putative blr clouds have been found recently in some other agn , notably ngc  1365 @xcite and mrk  766 @xcite .",
    "there are some important differences between the fairall  9 events and the events in these other sources .",
    "firstly , in ngc  1365 , even the non - eclipse spectrum shows significant absorption .",
    "by contrast , the non - dip state of fairall  9 is notable for being so clean , having _ no _ discernible cold or ionized absorption seen in any of its previous _ asca _",
    "@xcite , _ xmm - newton _ @xcite or _ suzaku _ @xcite observations .",
    "secondly , the eclipsing clouds in ngc  1365 and mrk  766 are generally compton - thin with strong evidence that the column density spikes up and then steadily decreases during the event .",
    "this led to the notion of blr  comets \" @xcite with high column density heads followed by lower column tails .",
    "by contrast , the fairall  9 clouds must be compton - thick , at least at the beginning of the dip event .",
    "however , a  comet \" scenario would predict a compton - thick to compton - thin transition , leading to a recovery of the hard band light curve before the soft band dip ends .",
    "the signal to noise of the current data is insufficient to detect such an early hard - band recovery .",
    "future studies with _ suzaku_. _ nustar _ or _ astro - h _ are required to test these predictions .",
    "the presence of well - defined compton - thick clouds in an otherwise extremely clean environment raises questions about cloud confinement and , more generally , the nature of these clouds @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of the physics of such clouds is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "we do however note that the properties of these clouds ( compton - thick and @xmath32 ) are consistent with the irradiated envelopes of circumnuclear stars .",
    "bloated stars have been ruled out as a viable model for the broad emission lines themselves on the basis of the smoothness of the h@xmath7 profile @xcite . however , especially in high - mass systems such as fairall  9 , bloated stars may nevertheless be present and could readily eclipse the x - ray source producing dips .",
    "could the dips be intrinsic to the accretion process , i.e. , signal a genuine  turning - off \" of x - ray emission from the inner accretion disk ?",
    "it will be useful to delineate a few characteristic timescales for the inner regions of this agn .",
    "the light crossing time of the inner x - ray emitting regions of the accretion disk ( say , out to @xmath33 ) is @xmath34 , and the dynamical timescale of the disk at @xmath33 is @xmath35 .",
    "assuming an angular momentum transport parameter @xmath36 , the thermal timescale at this radius is @xmath37 .",
    "finally , we consider the viscous timescale , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the geometric thickness of the accretion disk . with an average 210kev flux of @xmath40ergs / sec/@xmath41 and using a bolometric correction of 50 from @xcite , we find an eddington ratio of @xmath42 for fairall  9 .",
    "for such an eddington ratio ( and assuming a radiative efficiency of @xmath43 ) , standard accretion disk theory @xcite , the inner disk is radiation pressure dominated and has a geometric thickness @xmath44 .",
    "thus , at @xmath45 , we have @xmath46 and a viscous timescale of @xmath47 ( i.e. , approximately 110 days ) .",
    "the most obvious ( albeit dramatic ) scenario is one in which the innermost parts of the radiatively - efficient optically - thick accretion disk are destroyed / ejected by a dynamical or thermal instability .",
    "this is hypothesized to occur in radio - loud broad line radio galaxies ( blrgs ) as part of the process of jet formation @xcite . in the blrgs ,",
    "a distinct dip in the x - ray flux precedes large radio flares and the creation of a new superluminal knot .",
    "since , as with seyferts , the x - ray emission in blrgs is also dominated by the corona of the inner accretion disk @xcite , this x - ray / radio connection conclusively demonstrates a link between changes in the inner accretion disk structure and powerful jet ejection events .",
    "in fact , it is instructive to compare directly fairall  9 with the blrg 3c120 .",
    "3c120 has a slightly lower - mass black hole , @xmath48 for 3c120 compared to @xmath49 for fairall  9 @xcite .",
    "however , they possess a very similar eddington ratio , @xmath50 compared to @xmath51 , derived using the bolometric luminosity for 3c120 from @xcite .",
    "thus , their accretion disks might be expected to be in rather similar regimes of behavior .",
    "it is possible that the x - ray dips seen in fairall  9 have the same physical origin as the ejection - related x - ray dips seen in 3c120 but , for some reason , these disk disruption events lead to the creation of powerful jet outflows in 3c120 but not in fairall  9 ( indeed , fairall  9 has yet to be detected in the radio band , with an upper limit of @xmath52mjy at 1.4ghz , see * ? ? ?",
    "either the magnitude / direction of the black hole spin or the magnetic field structure in the inner disk may be the determining factor in deciding whether disk disruptions generate relativistic outflows .",
    "for fairall  9 , the black hole spin has already been measured and was found to be moderate @xcite .",
    "observations of galactic black hole x - ray binaries support this idea of viewing the dips in the context of jet ejections , as some were observed to possess very faint jets , undetectable in case of an agn @xcite .",
