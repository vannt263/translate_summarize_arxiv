    "according to cosmological n - body / hydrodynamic simulations , intergalactic shock waves develop as a consequence of the large scale structure formation of the universe .",
    "infall of baryonic gas toward sheets , filaments and knots , as well as supersonic flows associated with hierarchical clustering , induce shocks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . those cosmological shock waves , like most astrophysical shocks , are `` collisionless '' features mediated by collective , electromagnetic viscosities . such viscosities rely on irregular magnetic field components , mhd wave turbulence that is self - excited by the streaming suprathermal particles produced during shock formation ( see , e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the existence and character of these shocks is important for several reasons . through dissipation",
    "the cosmological shock waves convert part of the gravitational energy associated with structure formation into heat and , thus , govern the gas thermal history in the universe .",
    "thermal energy is then radiated away , manifesting the large scale structure as well as the dynamics that created it ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at the same time , due to incomplete plasma thermalization at collisionless shocks , a sizeable portion of the shock energy can be converted into cosmic ray ( cr ) energy ( mostly ionic ) via diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) ( for reviews , see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this nonthermal population represents a small fraction of the ion flux through a collisionless shock that leaks back upstream to become subject to dsa ; that is , to be `` injected '' into the nonthermal population . numerous nonlinear studies of dsa have shown that substantial fractions of the energy flux through strong shocks can be captured by the nonthermal populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "extensive nonlinear simulations by some of us incorporating a plasma - physics - based `` thermal leakage '' injection model into combined gas dynamic / cr diffusion - convection simulations found that strong shocks transfer up to @xmath7 of the initial shock kinetic energy to crs by this process @xcite .",
    "there is clear evidence that one or more processes energize significant nonthermal particle populations in and around cosmic structures .",
    "a number of clusters have been found with diffuse synchrotron radio halos or / and radio relic sources , indicating the existence of relativistic electron populations in intracluster medium ( icm ) ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , some clusters have been reported to possess excess euv and/or hard x - ray radiation compared to that expected from the hot , thermal x - ray emitting icm , most likely produced by inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) photons by cr electrons ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . also it has been suggested that a fraction of the diffuse @xmath9-ray background radiation could originate from the same process @xcite .",
    "if some of those cr electrons have been energized at cosmological shock waves , the same process should have produced greater cr proton populations .",
    "hence , although cr protons in the icm have yet to be confirmed by the observation of @xmath9-ray photons produced by inelastic collisions between cr and thermal - gas protons ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , there may very well exist cr proton populations there whose pressure is comparable to the gas thermal pressure @xcite .",
    "the properties of cosmological shock waves in the large scale structure of the universe were analyzed quantitatively by @xcite using numerical simulations with @xmath10 grid zones in a cubic comoving region of size @xmath11 mpc for a scdm model and a @xmath0cdm model .",
    "they identified accretion shocks , merger shocks and internal flow shocks which were formed by infall and hierarchical clustering , and showed that the topology of these shocks is very complex .",
    "they found merger and internal flow shocks distributed over mach numbers from 3 to 10 with a peak at @xmath12 and accretion shock mach numbers ranging between 10 and a few @xmath13 . in a recent study based on a higher resolution simulation with @xmath14 grid zones in a cubic comoving region of size @xmath15 mpc for a @xmath0cdm model",

    ", we critically re - examine the properties of cosmological shock waves with a new set of cosmic structure formation simulations .",

    "simulations are detailed along with shock identification . the main results of shock characteristics and shock dissipation are described in  3 and  4 , respectively , followed by a summary in  5 .",
    "the cold dark matter cosmology with a cosmological constant ( @xmath0cdm ) was employed with the following parameters : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , @xmath22/(100 km / s / mpc ) = 0.7 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the above values are consistent with those fitted with the recent wmap data ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". a cubic region of comoving size @xmath24 mpc was simulated inside a computational box with @xmath25 , @xmath14 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 grid zones for gas and gravity and @xmath14 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 particles for dark matter .",
    "it allows a uniform spatial resolution of @xmath30 kpc @xmath31 @xmath32 mpc .",
    "the simulations were performed using a pm / eulerian hydrodynamic cosmology code .",
    "the code is described in @xcite .",
    "but the version of the code used includes several updates . for instance",
    ", it now adopts the mc ( monotonized central difference ) limiter , instead of the original minmod limiter .",
    "the update to the mc limiter was intended to enhance the density resolution and to capture shocks more sharply ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "we did not include in our simulations several physical processes such as radiative cooling , galaxy / star formation , feedback from galaxies and stars , that can play significant roles in determining conditions within cluster cores , nor reionization of the intergalactic medium that effectively sets a temperature floor to the igm .",
    "our primary goal is to study cosmological shocks which are mostly outside cluster core regions .",
    "we established a temperature floor as a part of our analysis procedure .",
    "the conclusions drawn in this study , hence , should not be significantly weakened by the exclusion of those additional physical processes .      while shocks are automatically detected during the simulations by the riemann solver within the hydrodynamics routine ,",
    "there are additional steps necessary to identify and characterize shocks for analysis .",
    "we have done this as a post - processing step using the simulation data at selected epochs .",
    "ideally , explicitly three - dimensional flow motions should be considered in identifying shocks in simulation data . however , to simplify the analysis we used a one - dimensional procedure applied successively in all three primary directions .",
    "a zone was tagged as a `` shock zone '' currently experiencing shock dissipation whenever these three criteria are met : 1 ) @xmath33 , the gradients of gas temperature and entropy have the same sign , 2 ) @xmath34 the local flow is converging ( where @xmath35 is the divergence of three - dimensional velocity field ) , 3 ) @xmath36 , where in each case we define central differences according to the scheme , @xmath37 .",
    "the third condition corresponds to the temperature jump of a mach 1.3 shock .",
    "typically , a shock is represented by a jump spread over @xmath38 tagged zones .",
    "hence , we identified a `` shock center '' within the numerical shock where @xmath35 is minimum and labeled this center as part of a shock surface .",
    "the mach number of shock centers , @xmath39 , was calculated from the temperature jump across shocks , which is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the postshock and preshock temperatures .",
    "shock centers identified in multiple directional passes were labeled by the maximum @xmath39 .",
    "we followed only those portions of shock surfaces with @xmath2 to avoid confusion from complex flow patterns and shock surface topologies associated with very weak shocks . in the actual simulations ,",
    "the minimum gas temperature was set as the temperature of cmbr , that is , @xmath43 , since photoionization and heating as well as radiative cooling were ignored .",
    "however , considering that significant reionization would have taken place by @xmath44 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in post - processing we set the minimum gas temperature at @xmath45 k. the shock properties described below include that consistency adjustment .",
    "figure 1 shows a two - dimensional slice from the @xmath25 simulation isolating a typical group with x - ray emission weighted temperature , @xmath46 kev , and x - ray luminosity , @xmath47 erg s@xmath48 .",
    "the figure shows the locations of identified shocks along with the x - ray emissivity , gas temperature , density , and velocity field distributions .",
    "although the x - ray emissivity distribution looks relatively smooth and round , there are complex accreting flows around the group including three sheets ( dotted line contours in the temperature contour map ) and one filament ( thin solid line contours ) .",
    "a complex topology of shock surfaces surrounding the group can be seen in the temperature contour map and through the locations of identified shocks .",
    "the group as well as the associated sheets and filament are bounded by shocks , but there are several additional shock structures within that represent a variety of converging flow patterns . to illustrate the limitations of conventional spherical accretion concepts , we note that this group provides an example of structures where shocks can form in the core by organized infall flows accreting from filaments and sheets that penetrate deep into the center of potential wells .",
    "the mach number of the surface along the portion of the accretion shock centered at @xmath49 mpc ranges over @xmath50 with a mean value of 3.2 , while that along the portion centered at @xmath51 mpc ranges @xmath52 with a mean value of 6.5 .",
    "although quite strong shocks of mach number of a few , including these , were often found within @xmath53 mpc from the center of clusters and groups , most shocks identified in our simulations are located outside the cores of clusters and groups ( see the next section and figure 5 ) .    in order to illustrate how our shock identification scheme works , we plot in figure 2 the flow structure along the horizontal path drawn just below @xmath54 mpc in the shock location plot of figure 1 . as indicated in the upper right panel of the figure , two outer shocks with high mach numbers and three inner shocks with lower mach numbers",
    "were identified along the path .",
    "the existence of these five shocks is also clearly evident in the velocity field and temperature contours in figure 1 .",
    "extensive tests showed that our scheme identifies shock surfaces reliably with a typical error of a few percent in mach number .",
    "in previous studies by @xcite and by other authors , cosmological shock waves were often organized into three categories ; accretion shocks , merger shocks , and internal flow shocks . however , based on close examination of shock locations and the properties of the shocks and their associated flows in our simulations , we suggest instead that it is very informative to classify cosmological shocks into two broad populations that can be conveniently labeled as _ external _ and _ internal _ shocks , depending on whether or not the associated preshock gas was previously shocked ( that is , whether @xmath55 or @xmath56 for the preshock temperature in practice ) .",
    "this binary classification facilitates the understanding of their role in energy dissipation ( see the next section ) . _",
    "external shocks _ surround sheets , filaments and knots , forming when never - shocked , low density , void gas accretes onto those nonlinear structures .",
    "subsequent , _ internal shocks _ are distributed within the regions bounded by external shocks . they are produced by flow motions accompanying hierarchical structure formation inside the bounding shocks . for more refined questions internal shocks can be further divided into three types : 1 ) accretion shocks produced by infall from sheets to filaments and knots and from filaments to knots , 2 ) merger shocks formed during subclump mergers , and 3 ) flow shocks induced by chaotic supersonic motions inside the nonlinear structures .",
    "figure 3 represents a two dimensional slice of a @xmath57 mpc)@xmath58 volume extracted from the @xmath25 grid zone simulation .",
    "it shows the distributions of external and internal shocks in a cluster with x - ray emission - weighted temperature , @xmath59 kev , and x - ray luminosity , @xmath60 erg s@xmath48 , along with the gas density distribution and the velocity field of the inner parts of the slice .",
    "external shocks here define an entire `` cluster complex '' which has dimensions of about @xmath61 .",
    "numerous internal shocks were identified inside the complex .",
    "the two - dimensional velocity field demonstrates that infalls from several associated filaments and sheets form accretion shocks and also induce chaotic flow motions in the medium around the cluster .",
    "figure 4 shows a three - dimensional view of shock surfaces around the same cluster complex .",
    "surfaces of external shocks with high mach numbers , represented with yellow , encompass the complex and filaments associated with it .",
    "several sheets with lower mach numbers , which intersect at the complex , are also clearly visible .",
    "these figures show clearly that the canonical spherical external accretion shock model around a cluster would be far too simple to apply to this sample cluster .",
    "note , in particular , that a `` spherical '' cluster of @xmath62 kev has the first caustic at @xmath63 mpc from the center in our @xmath0cdm model @xcite , around which the external shock would be located .",
    "that is well inside the external , accretion shock in this simulated cluster complex .",
    "we will now estimate some quantitative measures of shock frequency . to start we computed the surface area of identified shocks per logarithmic mach number interval , @xmath64 , normalized by the volume of the simulation box .",
    "this provides an effective inverse comoving mean distance between shock surfaces . in this accounting",
    "each shock center contributes a surface @xmath65 , which is the mean projected area within a three - dimensional zone for random shock normal orientations .",
    "the upper two panels of figure 5 show @xmath64 for external and internal shocks at several epochs in the simulation with @xmath25 grid zones .",
    "table 1 lists the integrated mean shock separation , @xmath66 , along with the mean values of the shock mach number , the shock speed , the preshock sound speed and the preshock gas density .",
    "several important points are apparent .",
    "1 ) the two populations of shocks have distinctive distributions of shock surfaces , @xmath64 , implying they are induced by flows of different characteristics .",
    "the area distribution of external shock surfaces peaks at @xmath67 , extending up to @xmath1 or higher .",
    "in contrast , the comoving area of internal shocks increases to the weakest shocks we identified in our analysis ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "2 ) while the comoving area of external shock surfaces has not changed much since @xmath69 , that of internal shocks has increased significantly .",
    "the former behavior reflects the fact that the `` bounding '' shapes associated with external shocks have evolved towards simpler shapes to almost balance the increasing comoving volumes enclosed . on the other hand both",
    "the volume enclosed and the complexity of internal shocks has increased , so that these shocks now include more area . at the present epoch",
    "the total area of external shock surfaces is @xmath70 times of that of identified internal shocks .",
    "3 ) although the mean mach number is higher for external shocks , the mean shock speed is actually larger for internal shock . in addition , the preshock gas density is significantly higher for internal shocks .",
    "these factors enhance their dynamical importance ( see the next section ) .",
    "4 ) we found that most clusters and groups with @xmath71 kev have shocks within @xmath72 mpc from the centers at present .",
    "the area distribution of these `` cluster shocks '' , shown in the upper right panel of figure 5 , fits best to @xmath73 with @xmath74 in the range of @xmath75 .",
    "their mean mach number is @xmath76 .",
    "the cluster shocks , however , actually account for only a very small fraction of identified shock surfaces .",
    "we emphasize that the statistics for the cluster shocks would have been affected by the finite resolution , @xmath30 kpc , as well as by the exclusion of physical processes like radiative cooling and feedback from galaxies and stars that influence conditions inside cluster cores .",
    "still , it is significant that , compared with the distribution of binary merger shocks studied in @xcite , shocks with higher mach numbers are more common in the environments of clusters and groups in our simulation .",
    "this difference is because our cluster shock population includes accretion shocks created by infall from filaments and sheets to knots and flow shocks generated by chaotic supersonic motions , as well as those induced by hierarchical merging .",
    "especially , internal accretion shocks are strong with a typical mach number of several ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "the lower two panels of figure 5 show @xmath77 for external and internal shocks at @xmath78 in the simulations with different numerical resolutions of @xmath79 grid zones .",
    "table 2 lists the integrated surface area , @xmath80 , along with the mass of the gas that went through shocks at least once , @xmath81 , and the total gas thermal energy inside the computational box , @xmath82 , at the present epoch in the simulations with @xmath83 grid zones .",
    "the shocked gas mass , @xmath84 was estimated by summing the mass of gas with @xmath85 k. we expect that finite resolution would affect the statistics of shocks in two different ways : 1 ) some shocks , especially weak ones with low mach numbers , may not have been `` captured '' in the hydrodynamic part of simulations , and 2 ) they may not have been `` identified '' by our post - processing shock identification scheme , especially in the regions with complex three - dimensional flow structures .",
    "the former causes quantities like @xmath84 and @xmath86 to be underestimated . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter reduces the estimated value of @xmath87 and so the estimation of shock dissipation ( see the next section ) .",
    "we see that @xmath84 and @xmath86 converge rather quickly and their converged values should be within @xmath88 or so of those from the simulation with @xmath25 .",
    "this indicates that the ability of our code to capture shocks is not the major limitation .",
    "the convergence of the mean shock separation , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , is not as obvious from the table .",
    "the difficulties in reaching final convergence in these quantities is evident in figure 5 .",
    "detection of strong shocks with @xmath91 , especially strong external shocks , is relatively robust in the simulation data with @xmath26 or more grid zones .",
    "however , the area spanned by weak shocks continues to increase with resolution , reflecting the increased flow complexity captured inside nonlinear structures .",
    "the quantities of @xmath89 and @xmath90 are , however , also plotted in figure 8 , where it is evident that convergence is underway between the two highest resolution simulations .",
    "it is likely that @xmath92 mpc , and @xmath93 .",
    "it is , then , interesting to note that since the volume of the nonlinear structures where internal shocks are found is @xmath94 of the entire computed volume , the mean distance between internal shock surfaces is @xmath95 mpc within the nonlinear structures , which is comparable to the scale of the nonlinear structure involved .",
    "this conclusion , of course , includes the caveats that only shocks with @xmath96 have been counted and that we have omitted from the simulations physics likely to influence shock formation inside cluster cores . accepting the above limitations , we argue in the next section from estimations of the gas thermal energy dissipated at shocks and the mass passed through external shocks that the identification of dynamically important shocks should be complete within an error of order @xmath97 in the simulation data with @xmath25 grid zones .",
    "as the first step to quantitative estimates of the gas thermal energy and cr energy from dissipation at cosmological shock waves , we defined the following fluxes of mass and energies at each `` shock center '' : 1 ) the gas mass flux incident on shocks , @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) ; 2 ) the incident kinetic energy flux , @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) ; 3 ) the thermal energy flux generated at shocks , @xmath102 ( defined below ) ; and 4 ) the cr energy extracted , `` nonthermal dissipation '' , at shocks , @xmath103 ( defined below ) .",
    "here subscripts 1 and 2 stand for preshock and postshock conditions , respectively .",
    "we define thermal energy flux generated at shocks as @xmath104u_2.\\ ] ] we point out that the second term inside the brackets subtracts the effect of adiabatic compression occurred at a shock , not simply the thermal energy flux entering the shock ; namely , @xmath105 .",
    "the ratio @xmath106 then defines the efficiency of shock thermalization , which is a function of mach number only , and can be determined from the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions .",
    "the left panel of figure 6 shows @xmath107 .",
    "as expected , @xmath107 increases with mach number , asymptotically approaching @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "we express the cr energy extraction rate as @xmath110 , where @xmath111 measures the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration for a given mach number . to estimate this efficiency",
    "we have used results of numerical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of cr modified quasi - parallel plane shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the simulations utilize a plasma - physics - based model for the leakage of thermal ions into the cr population , which depends on a single parameter measuring the enhancement of nonlinear scattering waves across the shock transition . that parameter is reasonably well limited by the theory and by plasma simulations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and , in the dsa simulation we used , typically limits the fraction of protons injected into the cr population at shocks to be of order @xmath112 .",
    "the cr acceleration efficiency characteristics of our dsa model are broadly consistent with other widely used theoretical and numerical studies of nonlinear cr shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to apply properties of our dsa model to cosmological shock waves , we calculated proton acceleration and accompanying cr - modified flow evolution for shocks with @xmath113 km s@xmath48 propagating into media of @xmath114 k , assuming bohm - type diffusion for the crs ( for details see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as the shock structures evolved we determined the ratio of the total cr energy extraction during the evolution of a shock to the kinetic energy passed through the shock according to @xmath115}.\\ ] ] the values of @xmath116 quickly reached approximate `` time - asymptotic '' values , after which the shock structures evolved approximately `` self - similarly . '' these asymptotic values of @xmath116 were taken as our estimates for @xmath117 .",
    "the left panel of figure 6 shows the resulting cr acceleration efficiency , @xmath117 , along with the gas thermalization efficiency @xmath107 .",
    "both @xmath107 and @xmath117 increase with mach number . in",
    "strong , high mach number shocks , @xmath117 approaches the asymptotic value of @xmath118 .",
    "we see that @xmath107 is somewhat larger than @xmath117 over all mach numbers . on the other hand",
    ", we note that @xmath119 was computed for purely gasdynamical shocks ; that is , without accounting for energy removal into crs and enhanced adiabatic compression within the cr shock precursor .",
    "if nonlinear dynamical feedback of crs were included self - consistently in estimating @xmath107 , the resulting @xmath107 would be somewhat smaller than that shown in figure 6 .    from the above gas mass and kinetic energy fluxes at each shock center , we calculated the associated fluxes through surfaces of shocks with mach number between @xmath120 and @xmath121 at different redshifts ; @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "we also calculated the similarly defined fluxes of gas thermal and cr energies dissipated at shocks as @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "the right panel of figure 6 illustrates @xmath126 per unit comoving volume for external and internal shocks at different redshifts in the simulation with @xmath25 grid zones .",
    "a noticeable point is that the kinetic energy flux , and also the gas mass flux through external shocks were larger in the past .",
    "this is because the preshock gas density was larger in the past .",
    "however , the kinetic energy flux through internal shocks has been more or less constant since @xmath127 , and was smaller before that .    to provide measures of the roles of shocks over time we integrated from @xmath128 to @xmath78 the gas mass and kinetic energy that passed through shock surfaces and the gas thermal and cr energies dissipated at shock surfaces as @xmath129 where the subscript @xmath130 stands for the four fluxes defined above .",
    "the quantities were normalized either to the shocked gas mass , @xmath131 , for mass or to the total gas thermal energy inside the computational box , @xmath132 , for energies ( see table 2 ) .",
    "we also summed these time - integrated measures to calculate the associated global shock - processed quantities , @xmath133 d \\log m.\\ ] ] @xmath134 and @xmath135 not only measure the total mass that passed through shocks in the @xmath128 to @xmath78 interval , but also , by way of their normalization , measure the mean number of times that gas has been subjected to shock dissipation .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath136 and its derivative measure the total kinetic energy that has been subject to shock dissipation .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath137 and @xmath138 compare the total thermal and cr energies that have resulted from shock dissipation .",
    "figure 7 shows @xmath139 and @xmath140 for external and internal shocks in the simulation with @xmath25 grid zones .",
    "again , several important points are apparent .",
    "1 ) the plots for @xmath135 and @xmath141 indicate that more mass has passed through internal shocks than external shocks .",
    "with @xmath142 for internal shocks , the mass inside the nonlinear structures of sheets , filaments and knots has been shocked , on average , twice or so by internal shocks from @xmath128 to 0 .",
    "but we note that @xmath135 for internal shocks increases to @xmath143 , the lowest mach number we kept , and weak shock identification is not fully converged yet with this numerical resolution .",
    "so the above value of 2.2 should be regarded as the lower limit .",
    "2 ) on the other hand , since gas enters the nonlinear structures by passing through external shocks , @xmath144 for external shocks ( the mass passed through external shocks from @xmath128 to 0 ) should match the increase in the shocked gas mass , @xmath84 , from @xmath128 to 0 . in the simulation with @xmath25 grid zones , we get @xmath145 for external shocks , while @xmath146 is expected with @xmath147 and @xmath148 ( where @xmath149 is the total gas mass in the computational box ) .",
    "although a fraction of the hot gas may have been heated above @xmath150 k by adiabatic compression in void regions or by weak shocks with @xmath151 , some of this discrepancy could be due to the under - counting of external shocks .",
    "so we estimate an error of @xmath88 or so in the completeness of the identification of external shocks .",
    "3 ) the lower two panels of figure 7 show that internal shocks play a more important role than external shocks in the dissipating energy associated with structure formation .",
    "specifically , internal shocks with @xmath152 account for @xmath7 of dissipation . while the thermal energy generation peaks for shocks in the range @xmath153 , the cr energy extraction peaks in the range @xmath154 .",
    "@xcite identified shocks with @xmath155 as the most important in gas thermalization .",
    "our result indicates a somewhat lower mach number range , because we found more weaker shocks in our simulation data .",
    "this difference is probably due to our greater resolution ( see , e.g. , figure 5 ) , as well as due to improved shock capturing in the present code and a more sophisticated shock identification scheme .",
    "4 ) the amount of thermal energy generated at shocks from @xmath128 to 0 was computed to be @xmath156 times the current gas thermal energy in the simulation with @xmath25 grid zones . since",
    "no other heating or cooling physics was included , there are two likely contributors to the difference .",
    "first , we attribute some of the difference to adiabatic expansion of nonlinear structures after formation .",
    "expansion of @xmath157 along each dimension would be enough to reduce the gas thermal energy by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "in addition , some of the discrepancy could be the result of multiple counting of internal shocks in the regions with complex flow structures .",
    "so again , we put an error of a few @xmath97 , at most , in the completeness of the identification of shocks .",
    "5 ) with the dsa model we adopted @xcite the ratio of the cr to gas thermal energies dissipated at cosmological shock waves with the mach number greater than 1.5 is @xmath158 .",
    "6 ) there are many shocks with @xmath159 , but they are not important in energetics . hence , although we ignored the shocks with @xmath151 in this work , that should not significantly impact quantitative energetics results presented here .",
    "figure 8 shows @xmath160 through all shock surfaces in the simulations with different resolution of @xmath83 grid zones .",
    "note that @xmath161 s were normalized with @xmath84 and @xmath162 for a given resolution ( table 2 ) . yet , for instance , @xmath136 , the integrated kinetic energy flux through shock surfaces , decreases in the plot by @xmath163 from @xmath25 to @xmath14 and by @xmath164 from @xmath14 to @xmath26 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath162 , the total gas thermal energy inside the computational box , decreases only by @xmath165 from @xmath25 to @xmath14 and @xmath166 from @xmath14 to @xmath26 .",
    "this reinforces the statements in the previous section that the error in quantitative assessments of this paper comes mostly from shock identification in the post - processing analysis rather than shock capturing in the code .",
    "this also shows that our estimation of an error of order @xmath97 in the data of the @xmath25 simulation is consistent with resolution convergence .",
    "we identified and studied shock waves with mach number @xmath2 in a set of cosmological n - body / hydrodynamic simulations for a @xmath0cdm universe in a cubic box of comoving size @xmath24 mpc . to facilitate the analysis of their properties , the cosmological shock waves were classified as external and internal shocks , depending on whether or not the preshock gas was previously shocked .",
    "external shocks form around outermost surfaces that encompass nonlinear structures , so they are by nature accretion shocks that decelerate the previously unshocked intergalactic gas infalling toward sheets , filaments and knots .",
    "internal shocks are produced within those nonlinear structures by accretion flows of previously shocked gas from sheets to filaments and knots and from filaments to knots , by merging of subclumps , or by chaotic flow motions induced in the course of hierarchical clustering .",
    "for all shocks of @xmath2 identified in the simulation of highest resolution , the mean distance between shock surfaces , the inverse indicator of shock occurrence , is @xmath167 mpc at present .",
    "further , external shocks are more extensive , with their surface area @xmath70 times larger than that of identified internal shocks at present . with the volume of nonlinear structures which is @xmath94 of the total volume ,",
    "the mean distance between internal shock surfaces is @xmath95 mpc within nonlinear structures at present . although external shocks typically have higher mach numbers , internal shocks have higher shock speed and higher preshock gas density . as a result , internal shocks are responsible for @xmath168 of gas thermalization and for @xmath169 of cr acceleration at shocks , and they process about 6 times more gas mass through shock surfaces than external shocks do from @xmath128 to @xmath78 . internal shocks with @xmath170",
    "are especially important in energy dissipation , contributing @xmath7 of the total . by adopting a model of cr proton acceleration based on nonlinear diffusive shock simulations @xcite ,",
    "our study predicts that the ratio of the cr to gas thermal energies dissipated at all cosmological shocks through the history of the universe could be @xmath8 .",
    "due to long cr proton trapping times and energy loss lifetimes , they should fill the volumes inside filaments and sheets as well as in clusters and groups .",
    "short electron lifetimes , however , lead that population to depend on other factors @xcite . the existence of substantial cr populations could have affected the evolution and the dynamical status of the large scale structure of the universe ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the examination of results from simulations of different resolutions showed that the convergence with resolution in shock identification is slower than in shock capture within the simulation itself .",
    "consistency checks and resolution convergence analysis lead to error estimates of order of @xmath97 in our quantitative estimates of the accounting of and energy dissipation in cosmological shock waves .",
    "strong , external shocks are energetically less important than moderate strength internal shocks .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that the large curvature radii and long life times of these shocks make them viable candidates to accelerate crs to ultra high energies of several @xmath171 ev @xcite .",
    "the mach number distribution and the amount of energy dissipation at cosmological shocks have significant implications for several cosmological observations such as radio and @xmath9-ray emissions as well as x - ray emission from the icm and contribution to the cosmic @xmath9-ray background from crs accelerated at these shocks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
