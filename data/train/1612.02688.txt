    "<S> it has been pointed out by various astronomers that very interesting relationship exists between interstellar alcohols and the corresponding thiols ( sulfur analogue of alcohols ) as far as the spectroscopic properties and chemical abundances are concerned . </S>",
    "<S> monohydric alcohols such as methanol and ethanol are widely observed and 1-propanol is recently claimed to have been seen in orion kl . among the monohydric thiols , </S>",
    "<S> methanethiol ( chemical analogue of methanol ) , has been firmly detected in orion kl and sgr b2(n2 ) and ethanethiol ( chemical analogue of ethanol ) has been claimed to be observed in sgr b2(n2 ) though the confirmation of this detection is yet to come . </S>",
    "<S> it is very likely that higher order thiols could be observed in these regions . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the formation of monohydric alcohols and their thiol analogues . based on our quantum chemical calculation and chemical modeling </S>",
    "<S> , we find that ` tg ' conformer of 1-propanethiol is a good candidate of astronomical interest . </S>",
    "<S> we present various spectroscopically relevant parameters of this molecule to assist its future detection in the interstellar medium ( ism ) . </S>"
