    "during the last years the evolution experienced by stars of intermediate mass after the consumption of central helium has received a growing interest by the astrophysical community .",
    "this phase , known as asymptotic giant branch ( agb , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is much shorter than the previous stages of core hydrogen and helium burning , but is extremely important for the role played by these sources in the pollution of the interstellar medium . during the agb evolution",
    "the stars loose all their external mantle , returning into the interstellar medium material whose chemical composition was altered by internal nuclear processes .",
    "agbs have been suggested as the main contributors to the pollution of the interstellar medium in globular clusters , giving rise to the formation of multiple populations @xcite .",
    "the gas ejected by agbs , possibly diluted with pristine gas , may stimulate the formation of one or more additional stellar components , overlapped to the original population present in the cluster @xcite .",
    "this scenario can explain most of the observational data , such as the chemical anomalies involving light elements @xcite and the photometric features of the main sequence and of the horizontal branch of globular clusters @xcite .",
    "the interest towards agbs stems also from the physical conditions of their circumstellar envelopes , particularly suitable to gas condensation into dust grains .",
    "the surface layers of these stars are sufficiently cool ( @xmath18k ) to allow dust formation at typical distances of 310 stellar radii from the surface , where the densities are still sufficiently large ( @xmath19 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to allow formation of meaningful quantities of dust .",
    "dust formation is a complex phenomenon , which is strongly interfaced with the dynamical and thermal structure of the winds of this class of objects @xcite .",
    "stellar pulsation is known to trigger the formation of periodic shocks , that favours the increase in the local density , thus stimulating gas condensation in cool regions in the stellar surroundings .",
    "radiation pressure on dust grains is currently believed as the dominant mechanism triggering mass loss in these structures @xcite .",
    "a self  consistent description of the dust formation process would require full coupling of results from stellar evolution modelling with the description of the wind .",
    "a natural outcome of such a treatment would be the outwards velocity of gas and dust particles leaving the star , thus the mass loss rate experienced . because we are still far from achieving this target , the few models available in the literature treat the wind independently , based on the results coming from the integration of the equations of stellar equilibrium , from which the values of luminosity , effective temperature and mass loss rate of the star are obtained @xcite .",
    "these studies may be considered as a preliminary step towards a more complete treatment , where central object and external wind are described simultaneously .",
    "the reliability of the results obtained , in terms of the amount of dust formed , is hampered by the uncertainties associated to the wind model , for what concerns , e.g. , the initial velocity of gas particles , the opacities relevant to determine the radiation pressure on grains , the sticking coefficients of each dust species @xcite .",
    "agb modelling is also relevant for the results obtained .",
    "the type of grains formed , either silicates or carbonaceous particles , depends on the description of the processes able to alter the surface chemistry of agbs , i.e. third dredge  up ( tdu ) and hot bottom burning ( hbb ) .",
    "the efficiency of either mechanisms is affected by the modelling of convection and in particular by the treatment of the convective / radiative interface @xcite and of the temperature gradient in regions unstable to convective motions @xcite .",
    "the description of mass loss is also extremely relevant , because it has a direct impact on the agb evolutionary time scale @xcite ; furthermore , the mass loss rate determines the density profile of the wind , thus the amount of dust formed .",
    "it is for all these reasons that results in the literature presented by different research groups , though using the same description of the wind and of the dust grains formation and growth , differ considerably in the mass and composition of dust formed @xcite .",
    "the scope of this work is to discuss how the properties of dust formed in the winds of agbs depend on the implementation of some fundamental features of the model , namely : i ) the macrophysics adopted to describe the agb evolution ; ii ) the thermodynamical description of the wind : iii ) the formation and growth of grains .",
    "we present a new grid of dust formation models assuming stellar metallicities of z=@xmath20 , which fills the gap among the chemistries of our previous explorations , i.e. z=@xmath21 @xcite , z=@xmath15 @xcite , z=@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this allows to explore in details the role played by the chemical composition in the dust formation process .",
    "also , this metallicity will enable to compare model predictions with observational data in the small magellanic cloud @xcite and in metal  rich galactic globular clusters @xcite .",
    "in addition to our previous investigations on this topic , we present agb models of different metallicities where",
    "i ) some extra  mixing is assumed from any convective border ( including the base of the external mantle ) ; ii ) the description of mass loss is based on hydrodynamical wind models including carbon  dust formation @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present an overview of the status of the art of the modelling of dust formation around agbs ; sections 3 and 4 describe the inputs used to model the agb evolution of stars and the dust grain growth in the expanding winds ; carbon dust formation is discussed in section 5 , whereas silicates production in more massive agbs experiencing hbb is presented in section 6 ; finally , section 7 is devoted to an overall discussion of the results obtained .",
    "the pioneering explorations by the heidelberg group @xcite set the framework to describe the dust formation process in the winds of agbs . the wind is assumed to expand isotropically from the surface of the star , moving with velocities of a few km / s , entering into the dust formation layer , where gas ( and dust ) particles are accelerated via radiation pressure on the newly formed grains .",
    "the dust grains are assumed to grow owing to the gas molecules impinging on the already formed solid particles .",
    "the rate at which the grains grow scales with the density of the gas ; this defines a very narrow region where dust formation occurs .",
    "an asymptotic behaviour is reached , with the wind expanding outwards with large velocities ( tipically @xmath23 km / s ) .",
    "this is a simplified view of a much more complex situation , where large amplitude pulsations trigger periodic shocks @xcite : gas particles , rather than expanding at constant velocity , are projected on ballistic trajectories , where they contribute to the increase in the local density in regions very cool , thus extremely suitable to dust formation @xcite .",
    "a complete , self  consistent treatment would require the simultaneous description of the periodic variation of the stellar properties and of the structure of the wind , such that condensation takes place in the regions where the shock favours the increase in the density . a natural outcome of such a treatment would be the determination of the mass loss rate , via the density and the velocities of the gas leaving the star @xcite .",
    "such a self  consistent approach is still missing and the models currently available treat the wind independently , assuming as inputs the physical parameters of the central star , i.e. effective temperature , luminosity , mass loss rate and the surface chemical composition .",
    "the most relevant shortcoming of this approach is the lack of any feedback between the formation of dust grains and the mass loss rate , which is assumed apriori ; we will come back to this point in the following .    because the structure of the wind is based on the properties of the central star , the effective temperature ( t@xmath24 ) , luminosity ( l ) and mass loss rate ( @xmath25 ) are key quantities in determining the amount of dust formed .",
    "condensation of gas molecules is favoured at low t@xmath24 s , because smaller temperatures in the wind allows the dust forming region to be closer to the surface of the star , in higher density zones .",
    "larger values of @xmath25 favour dust formation , because mass conservation requires the density in the wind to increase linearly with @xmath25 ( see eq .",
    "[ eqro ] below ) .",
    "luminosity has no direct impact on the dust formation process , but it affects the acceleration due to radiation pressure , which scales with l ( eq .",
    "[ eqv ] and [ eqgamma ] below ) .",
    "the surface chemistry of the star is relevant in determining which kind of dust is formed .",
    "the co molecule has an extremely large dissociation energy ( 11ev ) , which means that the least abundant between carbon and oxygen is bound in co molecules . in c  rich environments there is no oxygen available , thus the only dust that can be formed is solid carbon , silicon carbide ( sic ) and iron @xcite . when the c / o ratio is below unity all the carbon present is locked into co : silicates , iron and corundum can form @xcite .",
    "the physical evolution of agbs , and of their surface chemistry , depends on some fundamental physical properties such as convection and mass loss @xcite .",
    "the treatment of the convective instability is the largest uncertainty affecting stellar evolution models .",
    "owing to the lack of a self  consistent theory of turbulence , the transport of energy within regions unstable to convective motions is treated parametrically . the mixing length @xmath26 , the typical scale of convective motions , is assumed to be proportional to the pressure scale height h@xmath27 : @xmath28h@xmath27 .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 is calibrated to reproduce the current radius of the sun ; with the latest updates in the micro ",
    "physics adopted , recent investigations give @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the agb phase is the most sensitive to the convection model adopted .",
    "models based on the full spectrum of turbulence ( fst , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) evolve at larger luminosities , on more expanded configurations , in comparison with their counterparts calculated with the traditional mixing length theory @xcite .",
    "fst models loose their envelopes more rapidly , and experience on the average a smaller number of thermal pulses ( tp ) .",
    "the efficiency of the convective model adopted has also an important feedback on the hot bottom burning phenomenon , in models with mass m@xmath31m@xmath3 : the base of the convective envelope becomes sufficiently hot ( t@xmath32 mk ) to favour an advanced proton capture nucleosynthesis , with the destruction of the surface carbon , and , when the temperatures exceed @xmath33 mk , the depletion of oxygen and the production of aluminium via activation of the mg  al chain .",
    "hbb is found in all models with core mass above @xmath34m@xmath3 when convection is modelled according to the fst formulation .",
    "also mlt models with @xmath35 achieve much more easily hbb conditions @xcite .",
    "the ignition of hbb is accompanied by the increase in the luminosity @xcite , which , in turn , triggers the increase in the mass loss rate .    in models experiencing hbb",
    "the production of silicates is greatly favoured : the c  star stage is inhibited by the destruction of the surface carbon , and the star evolves at large luminosities , loose mass at a high rate , which increase the dust formation rate .",
    "low  mass agbs ( m below @xmath36m@xmath3 ) do not reach hbb conditions , independently of convection modelling . in these stars",
    "the only mechanism able to alter the surface chemistry is the third dredge  up , which gradually enriches the surface in carbon , eventually making c / o to exceed unity .",
    "initially , when the mass loss rate is small and the c  star stage is not yet reached , small quantities of silicates are produced ; in the final evolutionary stages carbon dust is produced in great quantities , owing to the large surface carbon abundances and the high mass loss rates experienced .",
    "while there is a general consensus on the sequence of events given above , the amount of carbon dust formed is still matter of debate , because the evolutionary stage at which the star becomes a c  star and the extent of the surface carbon enrichment depend on the inwards penetration of the convective envelope during the tdu ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "this is rendered uncertain by the poor knowledge of the behaviour of convective eddies near the convective / radiative interface , particularly of the extent of the extra  mixing , i.e. the distance they travel within radiatively stable regions .",
    "the extra  mixing from convective cores of stars in central burning phases can be calibrated via comparison with the observed main sequences of open clusters @xcite , by analysis of binary star data @xcite , and asterosismological investigations @xcite .",
    "the situation for the agb phase is more complex , as there is no observable that allows a straight calibration of the overshoot from the base of the envelope , and from the boundaries of the shell which forms at the ignition of each tp .",
    "the most widely argument used so far is the reproduction of the carbon star luminosity function in the magellanic clouds , which allows to determine the core mass at which tdu begins , and the extent of the inwards penetration of the convective envelope @xcite .",
    "these information can be used to estimate the extension of the mixed regions within the agbs interiors .",
    "the larger is the extra  mixing , the more carbon dust is produced , because more and more carbon is dredged  up to the surface regions .",
    "the description of the mass loss mechanism is also extremely relevant in determining the evolution of agbs @xcite .",
    "the rate at which agbs loose mass determines the duration of the whole evolutionary phase @xcite , but has also important consequences on the modification of the surface chemistry . in massive agbs , experiencing hbb , the mass loss rate is stricly correlated with the degree of p  capture nuclesynthesis at the bottom of the surface envelope : lower rates allow a stronger nucleosynthesis , thus larger changes in the abundances of the elements involved in the cno , ne  na and mg ",
    "al cycles . in the low  mass regime ,",
    "large rates favour faster consumption of the envelope : the star undergoes a smaller number of tps , thus the carbon surface enrichment is reduced .",
    "this has a strong impact on the dust formation in the circumstellar envelopes .",
    "a direct effect of the mass loss description is associated with the higher density of the winds when the mass loss is large , which enhance dust production . also , as stated above",
    ", mass loss changes the surface chemical composition , and the mass fractions of those elements relevant to allow dust formation ( e.g carbon for carbon  type dust ) : this clearly changes the amount of dust which can be formed .",
    "the evolutionary sequences presented here were computed by means of the aton code for stellar evolution .",
    "the interested reader may find in @xcite a detailed description of the numerical structure of the code .",
    "the most recent updates can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "we recall here the main physical inputs , most relevant for the topic of the present investigation .",
    "the arguments presented in the previous section outline how relevant the description of convection is for the agb phase , in terms of the evolution of the main physical quantities , number of thermal pulses experienced , change in the surface chemical composition due to hbb and tdu .    in agreement with other investigations by our group ,",
    "the temperature gradient within convective regions is found by the fst model , developed by @xcite .",
    "mixing of chemicals and nuclear burning were coupled with a diffusive approach , according to the scheme suggested by @xcite .",
    "the overshoot of convective eddies into radiatively stable regions is described by an exponential decay of the velocity @xmath37 beyond the formal border found via the schwarzschild criterion .",
    "the relation used is    @xmath38    where the argument of the exponential is taken positive for overshoot from the upper border of the convective zone , whereas the minus sign is used for overshoot below the convective region .",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 are the values of velocity and pressure at the formal boundary .",
    "the extent of the overshoot is given by the free parameter @xmath41 .",
    "for the convective cores that form during the hydrogen and helium burning phases , and generally for the phases previous the agb evolution , we followed the calibration given in @xcite , and assumed @xmath42 .    for what concerns the agb phase , we calibrated the extent of the extra  mixing from the base of the convective envelope and from the borders of the shell that forms at the ignition of each thermal pulse based on the luminosity function ( lf ) of carbon stars in the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "we find that adopting @xmath43 leads to a satisfactory agreement between the observed and the predicted lfs . with this assumption",
    "we recover the relation between initial mass and luminosity of the transition from o  rich to c  rich surface chemical composition given in @xcite .      in agreement with our previous explorations focused on the agb evolution ,",
    "we use for the phases preceeding the c  star stage the formulation by @xcite . the blcker formula ( @xmath44 , where m , r and l are , respectively , the stellar mass , radius and luminosity ) is suitable to describe the steep increase of @xmath45 with luminosity that characterizes massive agbs ; however , it underestimates the mass loss suffered by c  stars , because it is based on a description of the circumstellar envelope of mira variables that neglects the carbon  dust formation process , and the radiation pressure on dust grains , which induces a great acceleration of the wind . to describe the c  star phase we rely on the formulation by @xcite , giving the mass loss rates experienced by low  mass agbs as a function of mass , luminosity and effective temperature .",
    "the expression used is @xmath46 , where typical values for the exponents ( partly depending on the metallicity ) are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .      the radiative opacities @xmath50 for temperatures above @xmath51",

    "this choice allows to account for the increase in the opacity associated with the change in the surface chemistry determined by tdu .",

    "the structure of the wind and the dust formation process is described following the schematization by @xcite . as discussed in the introduction , the thermodynamic structure of the wind and the dust formation process",
    "are entirely determined by the physical and chemical conditions at the surface of the central star .",
    "the latter is assumed to evolve independently of the properties of the wind : this is possible because the mass loss rate is determined via a parametric recipe , rather than by full coupling of star s and wind s descriptions .",

    "<S> the dust formation process in the winds of asymptotic giant branch stars is discussed , based on full evolutionary models of stars with mass in the range @xmath0m@xmath1m@xmath2m@xmath3 , and metallicities @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> dust grains are assumed to form in an isotropically expanding wind , by growth of pre  existing seed nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> convection , for what concerns the treatment of convective borders and the efficiency of the schematization adopted , turns out to be the physical ingredient used to calculate the evolutionary sequences with the highest impact on the results obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> low  mass stars with m@xmath5m@xmath3 produce carbon type dust with also traces of silicon carbide . the mass of solid carbon formed , fairly independently of metallicity , ranges from a few @xmath6m@xmath3 , for stars of initial mass @xmath7m@xmath3 , to @xmath8m@xmath3 for m@xmath9m@xmath3 ; the size of dust particles is in the range @xmath10m@xmath11 m . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the production of silicon carbide ( sic ) depends on metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath12 the size of sic grains varies in the range @xmath13 m , while the mass of sic formed is @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> models of higher mass experience hot bottom burning , which prevents the formation of carbon stars , and favours the formation of silicates and corundum . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the results scale with metallicity , owing to the larger silicon and aluminium contained in higher  z models . at z=@xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> we find that the most massive stars produce dust masses @xmath16m@xmath3 , whereas models of smaller mass produce a dust mass ten times smaller . </S>",
    "<S> the main component of dust are silicates , although corundum is also formed , in not negligible quantities ( @xmath17 ) .    </S>",
