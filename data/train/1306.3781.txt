    "linear superposition principle in quantum mechanics tells us that spontaneous symmetry breaking is not possible in quantum mechanics as the infinite number of degenerate states that are associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking can superpose to give a general state that has the same symmetry as the hamiltonian . in spite of it , certain heavy nuclei exhibit rotational excitations , that can not be explained by the shell structure alone of a spherical nucleus .",
    "initial understanding of this was provided by bohr and mottelson @xcite in terms of collective modes of oscillation of a deformed nucleus .",
    "such nuclear deformation may well be due to spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "however as nuclear forces and nuclear hamiltonian are still not precisely known , a first principle quantum mechanical analytic understanding is not yet possible .",
    "similar ideas of spontaneous symmetry breaking can also explain the details of the mass spectra of alkali metal clusters and indicate the existence of a spin - density wave in quantum dots @xcite .    in these systems , since earlier days",
    ", researchers have approached the problem from two practical points of view although it becomes difficult to obtain a clear , reconciled understanding . in the first approach , one either makes a numerical solution of hartree - fock equations or the kohn - sham equations for a few electrons and",
    "obtain the electron density .",
    "the density profile shows a typical crystal like structure consisting of hills and valleys @xcite .",
    "it is known that this is an artifact of the non linearity of the equations in use while the exact theory is linear @xcite . in the other approach",
    ", one makes an exact diagonalization for even fewer electrons .",
    "whereby , the density do not show any signature of broken symmetry because of the linear superposition principle .",
    "however if one calculates the pair correlation function , then that shows oscillations @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "these oscillations survive over a finite length and decay rapidly which is expected in finite size systems .",
    "the correlation function is not defined in hartree - fock theory or density functional theory .",
    "the density oscillations obtained therein do not decay beyond a length scale .",
    "still one makes the ad hoc assumption that the non linearity of hartree - fock theory or density functional theory show density oscillations by projecting the pair correlation function and consequently , the discrepancy of the decay disappears for infinite systems . with exact diagonalization",
    ", one also looks at the degeneracy of eigen energies after subtracting the center of mass energy and checks if the degeneracy can be explained by the representative point group corresponding to the broken symmetry crystalline state @xcite .",
    "once again , one can not go to very large energy limits due to numerical problems . already at higher energies",
    "one starts to notice deviations from exact degeneracies just as oscillations in pair correlation function decay beyond a certain length scale @xcite .     where m is the total angular momenta and @xmath0 is the moment of inertia for 8 classical particles in a one dimensional ring .",

    "wigner crystallization of electrons , one such bulk phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking proposed long ago , is still a debatable issue .",

    "the points b and c correspond to excitations that are therefore decoupled from the center of mass motion and corresponds to vibrations of localized electrons in center of mass frame .",
    "if the parabolic contribution is subtracted then the yrast spectra show periodic oscillation ( fig . [ 1d]b ) .",

    "[ thickness ] and associated narrations , it seems that symmetry breaking is not possible in two dimensions that can be obtained by gradually increasing the thickness of a q1d ring .",
    "but if we increase the radius and the thickness simultaneously , it results in a symmetry breaking as we will explain now .",
    "we take 16 electrons interacting only due to fermi statistics and compare the energy spectra for two rings .",
    "one with inner radius 4@xmath57 and outer radius 6@xmath57 and another with inner radius 8@xmath57 and outer radius 12@xmath57 .",
    "here we have not plotted the yrast spectra , but plotted the energy values after subtracting the parabolic data we obtain by connecting the minima ( fig .",
    "[ rthickness ] ) .",
    "we see that both the curves show the same periodicity signifying broken symmetry .",
    "the amplitude of energy for the ring with inner radius 8@xmath57 and outer radius 12@xmath57 is 1/4-th of the amplitude for the ring with inner radius 4@xmath57 and outer radius 6@xmath57 .",
    "this is also similar to the case of a one dimensional ring , where if one makes the radius double , the energy becomes 1/4-th .",
    "hence it seems quite natural that , by increasing the radius and the thickness simultaneously one can observe symmetry breaking for an infinite two dimensional system as well .",
    "this is because the act of increasing the radius consequently lowers the azimuthal component of the momentum and the act of increasing the thickness lowers the radial component of the momentum .",
    "thus it seems that even in 2d , one can find very low energy states with a broken symmetry .     and @xmath92 , and circles are data for @xmath93 and @xmath91 for a ring with 16 spin up electrons . ]",

    "<S> electronic charge and spin separation leading to charge density wave and spin density wave is well established in one dimensional systems in the presence and absence of coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we start from quasi one dimension and show the possibility of such a transition in quasi one dimension as well as in two dimensions by going to a regime where it can be shown for free electrons that just interact via fermi statistics . since coulomb interaction can only facilitate the phenomenon , the purpose of our work is to show the phenomena unambiguously in the limit when coulomb interaction can be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> finally we also comment on dimensions greater than two and including coulomb interactions . </S>"
