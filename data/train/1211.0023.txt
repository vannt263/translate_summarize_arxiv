    "asteroid belts can ( in principle at least ) affect the habitability of a planet , the emergence of life , and potentially even the evolution of complex life in several important ways .",
    "terrestrial planets typically form in a dry region of a protoplanetary disc @xcite .",
    "water therefore must be later delivered to the planet s surface , most likely by asteroids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although other sources , such as comets and the interaction between the magma and atmosphere have been suggested @xcite . the formation of large moons may also require an asteroid collision @xcite , although here again , a different origin for the impactor has been considered ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our moon , for instance , stabilises the rotation axis of the earth and prevents weather extremes that would have resulted from chaotic motion .",
    "this process may not be universal , since it depends on initial conditions . according to some hypotheses , life",
    "itself may have been delivered to earth by an asteroid ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "heavy elements , including some that are essential for life , were also probably delivered to the earth s crust through collisions @xcite . during the early times of formation",
    "the earth was molten and its gravity pulled heavy elements to its core leaving the crust depleted of elements such as iron , gold and platinum . on a much more speculative note ,",
    "the asteroid impact that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs on earth @xcite may have allowed for the emergence of dominant mammals and intelligent life .",
    "the point is that even if only one of these ideas turns out to be true , it makes it extremely intriguing to examine the formation and evolution of asteroid belts and consider the possibility for complex life in other observed solar systems .",
    "the asteroid belt in our solar system is located between the inner terrestrial planets and the outer giant planets , between mars and jupiter .",
    "it contains millions of irregularly shaped bodies made of rock , ices and metals with a total mass of about 4 per cent of that of the earth s moon .",
    "studying the asteroid belt allows us a glimpse into the early stages of planet formation .",
    "observations suggest that at the time of planetesimal formation the location of the snow line was within the asteroid belt .",
    "the snow line marks the radius outside of which ice forms .",
    "the inner asteroids , closest to earth , are water devoid , while outside a radius of about @xmath1 the asteroids are icy c - class objects ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the asteroid belt formed from planetesimals within the solar nebula . in the generally accepted scenario",
    ", planetesimals stuck together to form larger and larger bodies until the protoplanets were formed .",
    "it is thought that the asteroid belt exists because gravitational perturbations from jupiter gave the planetesimals inside of its orbit too much orbital energy to form a planet .",
    "the violent collisions produced fragmentation rather than fusion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the picture that we envisage and examine in the current work , that was first observationally motivated by @xcite , is the following : giant planets likely form by core accretion outside of the snow line where the solid mass density is much higher because of water ice condensation @xcite .",
    "consequently , we propose that if an asteroid belt forms at all , _ its location is likely to be around that of the snow line_. simulations of the formation of terrestrial planets agree with this scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the habitable , rocky terrestrial planets should form inside the snow line , as was the case in our own solar system .",
    "observational evidence suggests that jupiter formed close to its current location .",
    "the generally accepted theory of the formation of our solar system infers that jupiter migrated through planetesimal interactions only by about @xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the asteroid belt is thought to have originally contained about an earth mass .",
    "as jupiter migrated slightly inwards , its gravitational perturbations caused the majority of the mass to be ejected , leaving behind only about 0.1 per cent of the original .",
    "jupiter is still responsible for nudging asteroids and sending them towards the inner solar system .",
    "it is unlikely that complex life would have have been able to develop on earth had the asteroid belt remained as massive as it had originally been , because there would have been far too many devastating impacts .",
    "however , it is probably also unlikely that complex life on earth would exist had all of the asteroids been scattered away .    to test our suggestion for the location of asteroid belts , in section  [ obs ] ,",
    "we first use detailed protoplanetary disc models to examine the location of the snow line for different stellar masses .",
    "we then describe and tabulate the observations of warm dust that may indicate the presence of exo - asteroid belts and show that their locations coincide with the snow line .",
    "the formation of the asteroid belt depends on the formation of an exterior giant planet . in section  [ hab ]",
    "we therefore consider observations of giant planets in exo - solar systems and discuss the implications of their locations for the presence of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone and the likelihood of a compact asteroid belt .",
    "we also examine the question of how special our solar system is .",
    "in this section we calculate numerical models of protoplanetary discs to determine the snow line evolution .",
    "we then examine observations of warm dust that may indicate the presence of exo - asteroid belts and show that their radial locations coincide with the theoretical radius of the snow line .",
    "the snow line marks the distance from the star outside of which ice forms .",
    "it is thought to occur at temperatures of around @xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite find that there is an extended region down to almost @xmath4 , the snow border , in which both icy and dry planetesimals can coexist .",
    "particles migrating through the disc accumulate near the snow line over a short radial extent and grow through collision @xcite .",
    "planetesimal formation rates increase by an order of magnitude or more moving across the snow line when the solid surface density increases by a factor of two @xcite .    to model the evolution of the snow line we used a detailed model for a layered protoplanetary disc of the type first described in @xcite and further developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we should note that our model is different from previous models that assumed a fully turbulent disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and failed to explain the current location of the snow line in the solar system ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) .",
    "in our model , the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) drives turbulence and angular momentum transport within the disc if it is sufficiently ionised @xcite .",
    "however , protoplanetary discs are thought to contain dead zones at the mid - plane ( a region of zero mri turbulence ) , because they are too cool for thermal ionisation , and cosmic rays or x - rays do not penetrate the entire disc @xcite .",
    "we used a critical magnetic reynolds number , @xmath5 , to determine the precise extent of the dead zone ( e.g. as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our simulations , where a dead zone is present",
    ", material accumulates and flows only through the active layers on the surfaces .",
    "once sufficient material collects , the dead zone becomes self - gravitating and a second type of gravitational turbulence is driven .",
    "the increased heating leads to the mri being triggered in the dead zone and fu orionis type outbursts . in the present work we are interested in the detailed structure of the disc at late evolutionary times , after the outbursts have ceased .",
    "we found that the snow line of the disc moves in over time ( as was also shown in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "here , we use the same disc model as in @xcite but we expand the calculation and consider central stars of different mass , @xmath6 . for each stellar mass",
    "we numerically evolve the time - dependent disc model up to a time of @xmath7 , and in fig .",
    "[ surf ] we show the radius , @xmath8 , of the inner and outer edges of the snow border that correspond to temperatures of @xmath9 and @xmath4 at times @xmath10 and @xmath7 .",
    "we find that the location of the snow line is only weakly dependent on the mass of the star .",
    "we can heuristically understand the general shape of the snow line location as a function of stellar mass by the following simple argument . since the generated power is due to accretion , @xmath11 . scaling to the radial location of the snow line in our solar system we have @xmath12 fig .",
    "1 shows that this analytic expression for the shape of the snow line is a reasonable approximation for the minimum snow line radius for the numerical models considered in this work .",

    "a large number of jupiter - mass planets exist much closer to their host star than jupiter is to our sun .",
    "it is thought that they formed farther out in the gas disc ( outside of the snow line ) and migrated inwards through type ii migration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this must have occurred within a few myr , while the gas disc was still present @xcite .",
    "in order for a planet not to migrate we require it to form at just the right time ( when the gas is depleted ) during the evolution of the protoplanetary disc .",
    "@xcite found that only in about @xmath66 of systems does the most massive planet around a solar type star linger around jupiter s orbital distance .    during the migration process",
    ", a significant fraction of an asteroid belt ( if present ) would be accreted on to the star , the planet , or scattered to large radii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence , we would not expect a substantial or compact asteroid belt in these systems .",
    "the observed warm dust belts described in section  [ obs ] , therefore , likely remain because there has been little or no giant planet migration .",
    "giant planets in these systems must have formed towards the end of the lifetime of the protoplanetary disc .",
    "we do however note that under special circumstances there could be asteroid belts elsewhere in the system but statistically speaking the most likely place that we have identified is around the snow line .    out of 520 giant planets shown in fig .  2 , only 19 are outside the snow line .",
    "we therefore suggest that less than @xmath0 of these _ observed _ systems could possibly harbour a compact asteroid belt .",
    "this is an upper limit because we have taken the lower limit on the snow line radius ( see section 2 ) and it is not clear how far out from the snow line giant planets form .",
    "for example , jupiter is twice the radial distance of the snow line in our solar system and is thought to have only migrated a short distance .",
    "planets close to the snow line , but still outside it , may have undergone more significant migration than jupiter which could have disrupted their asteroid belt .",
    "the observational results therefore agree with the theoretical models of @xcite and suggest that our solar system may be rather special .",
    "this argument is based on the detected giant planets , and not on the ( clearly difficult ) direct detection of asteroid belts .",
    "we should note though that selection effects almost certainly affect the statistics , because planets with higher orbital separations are more difficult to detect ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion ) .",
    "therefore , observations over longer periods of time will be needed to assess accurately how special our solar system really is ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "mars - size bodies are formed through planetesimal accretion on a timescale of @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "these coagulate on a timescale of around @xmath68 to form earth mass planets @xcite",
    ". this is considerably longer than the timescale to form the giant planets outside the snow line .",
    "thus , the inner giant planets ( `` hot jupiters '' ) must have migrated through the habitable zone ( that is around @xmath69 in our solar system , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) before terrestrial planet formation there was complete .",
    "earth mass planets could still be found ( in principle at least ) in orbits inner to the hot jupiters , however the hot conditions close to the star are unlikely to produce a habitable planet .    theoretically , terrestrial planet formation in the habitable zone after the inward migration of a giant planet is possible @xcite .",
    "replenishment of the solid disc material after the migration is inefficient @xcite , but @xcite found that more than 50 per cent of the solids survive the migration process and are scattered into larger radius orbits , where terrestrial planet formation can resume .",
    "the solid material of the scattered disc is diluted , excited and radially mixed .",
    "the resulting planets , that may form within the habitable zone , may be more water rich than earth due to inward mixing from outside the snow line .",
    "however , on the basis of the considerations presented in the introduction , one may speculate that the lack of a compact asteroid belt exterior to the planet s orbit makes the probability for complex life lower .",
    "an asteroid belt may be crucial for the emergence and evolution of life on a planet .",
    "asteroid collisions can deliver water , heavy metals and possibly even primitive life .",
    "they can also create large moons which can stabilise planets .",
    "while these ideas are clearly speculative , they are sufficiently intriguing to warrant an investigation of the formation and evolution of asteroid belts .",
    "we have proposed that asteroid belts , when present , are most likely to approximately coincide with the location of the snow line in protoplanetary discs . using detailed numerical models of protoplanetary discs",
    "we have shown that the radial distance and temperature of the snow line are indeed entirely consistent with that of observed warm dust , that could correspond to exo - asteroid belts .",
    "giant planets are likely to form outside the snow line , where the solid density increases , thus creating an interior asteroid belt around the snow line where the planetesimals are too excited to fuse . however ,",
    "less than about @xmath0 of the observed giant planets are found in this region .",
    "inward migration disrupts the asteroid belt .",
    "terrestrial planets may still form from scattered planetesimals in the habitable zone after the migration , but if asteroid belts are indeed necessary for complex life to evolve , then such evolution is unlikely in these systems . on the other hand",
    ", a small amount of giant planet migration may be necessary to remove a significant fraction of the initial belt mass because otherwise there would be too many devastating impacts on the planet for life to evolve .",
    "consequently , there appears to be a very narrow `` window of opportunity '' of time during which the giant planet should form , in order for the correct amount of migration to take place  potentially making our solar system even more special .",
    "we do note , however , that the presently existing data may be significantly affected by selection effects .",
    "long period planets are harder to observe , and in the future more giant planets may be observed outside of the snow line . based on our scenario , _ it is on these systems ( with a giant planet outside of an asteroid belt ) that we should concentrate our efforts to look for complex life .",
    "_ finally , we note that the asteroid belt could prove to be even more important to intelligent life on earth in the future . on one hand",
    ", asteroids could become a source of heavy metals that could be brought back to earth should our own sources become depleted ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and in addition , asteroids could also be used as a launch pad for further exploration .",
