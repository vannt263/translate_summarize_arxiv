    "feynman s path integral formulation of quantum mechanics  @xcite based on cited earlier work of heisenberg  @xcite and dirac  @xcite has two distinct parts .",
    "the first is a set of rules ( the laws i  v of section 2 below ) concerning the construction and interpretation of probability amplitudes for space - time experiments in quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "these rules are valid in both the non - relativistic and relativistic theories .",
    "the second part is the detailed mathematical development of the non - relativistic limit  @xcite .",
    "the most detailed working - out of feynman s space - time concepts for quantum mechanics is to be found , not in the research literature or text books , but in the popular book ` qed the strange story of light and matter '  @xcite published shortly before his death .",
    "the photons of which light consists are , of course , unlike the particles considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , ultra - relativistic . in this book , many experiments on propagation , reflection , refraction , diffraction and interference of light , which are conventionally described by the classical wave theory , are all treated as applications of feynman s path integral formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "although a complete physical description of the experiments was given ( neglecting only polarisation effects ) no equations were employed .",
    "many of the experiments described in this book have been worked out in full mathematical detail in a previous paper  @xcite by the present author .",
    "the present paper also describes physical optics experiments for both photons and massive particles ( electrons ) in a similar manner to ref .",
    "@xcite , but has more avowedly pedagogical goals .",
    "in particular , the path integral analysis of the experiments , is confronted , in a critical manner , with typical concepts of the ` copenhagen interpretation ' that are found in quantum mechanical text books .    before presenting a space - time analysis of the original davisson - germer experiment  @xcite in which ` matter waves ' were discovered , a reflection diffraction grating experiment with a similar geometry , but using photons produced in the decays of excited atoms , is analysed .",
    "although the two experiments are explained similarly by classical , spatial , wave theories with similarly defined phenomenological de broglie wavelengths , the underlying space - time physics is seen to be entirely different in the two cases .",
    "this distinction was previously pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of young double slit experiments using photons or electrons .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in the following section feynman s rules for constructing and interpreting probability amplitudes  @xcite are reviewed . in section 3 the space - time propagator for a free relativistic particle is derived .",
    "the following three sections present space - time analyses of different experiments : in section 4 , one in which a photon , produced in the decay of an excited atom , is detected , in section 5 , an experiment with a similarly produced photon scattered from a reflection diffraction grating , and in section 6 a similar experiment using an electron beam the davisson - germer experiment . in section 7",
    "it is shown , following , ref .",
    "@xcite , how the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics leads to similar , purely spatial , classical wave theories for both photons and massive particles , in spite of completely different underlying space - time processes in the two cases .",
    "the final section contains a critical discussion , in the light of the experiments presented , of some basic concepts within the standard ` copenhagen interpretation '  @xcite of wave - mechanics , such as wave packets and uncertainty relations .",
    "finally the interpretation of the famous ` schrdinger s cat ' experiment  @xcite within the path integral formulation is considered .",
    "feynman s path integral formulation of quantum mechanics is the development of earlier work by heisenberg and dirac in which the axiomatic basis of the formulation was already specified .",
    "heisenberg s work  @xcite , concerned the manner in which probability amplitudes are to be constructed and interpreted .",
    "dirac s seminal paper ` the lagrangian in quantum mechanics '  @xcite provided the dynamical foundation of the theory by specifiying the connection between a quantum mechanical path amplitude and the lagrangian function of the corresponding classical system .",
    "this work of heisenberg and dirac is valid in both the non - relativistic and relativistic limits of the theory .",
    "feynman chose , in his original path integral paper  @xcite , to consider only the non - relativistic case for detailed mathematical treatment .",
    "however , section 2 of this paper , ` the superposition of probability amplitudes ' , reviewing the earlier work of heisenberg  @xcite , is applicable also to the relativistic theory . the construction of probability amplitudes for a space - time quantum mechanical experiment , and how such an experiment differs from the corresponding classical experiment , which , according to heisenberg , ` when stated in a sufficiently general form ' is ` the center of the whole quantum theory '  @xcite , will now be described .",
    "suppose that some quantum mechanical system is prepared in the state @xmath0 and measured to be in the state @xmath1 , having , at some intermediate time , passed through the state @xmath2 . and detected in another @xmath3 having passed through an intermediate state @xmath4 may be considered , though the formula ( 2.1 ) is of quite general validity . ]",
    "the probability amplitude to measure the state @xmath5 given the prepared state @xmath6 is : @xmath7 where the dirac bra - ket notation  @xcite for states and transition amplitudes is employed . in this formula",
    "the amplitudes @xmath8 are complex numbers determined by the underlying physics of the process considered .",
    "they are typically either space - time propagators giving the amplitude to find a particle at some position when it is at a known position at some earlier time , or the amplitude for a particle scattering or production process .    according to the born rule  @xcite the probability to observe the state @xmath5 given the states @xmath6 and @xmath9 is : @xmath10 this formula expresses the law of conditional probability : the probability of @xmath5 given @xmath9 and @xmath6 is the probability of @xmath9 given @xmath6 times the probability of @xmath5 given @xmath9 . if @xmath9 takes , with equal probabilities , several different , but unknown , values the overall probability @xmath11 ( where the suffix @xmath12 stands for ` classical ' ) of @xmath5 , given @xmath6 , is : @xmath13 i.e. the overall probability is the sum of the conditional probabilities . in quantum mechanics , the formula ( 2.3 ) for the case that the intermediate state @xmath2 is one of a set specified by the label @xmath9 , but the value of @xmath9 is unknown , is replaced by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 expresses the _ principle of superposition of the path amplitudes @xmath16_.    the difference between ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) and the non - intuitive nature of the latter equation constitute what feynman called ( as exemplified in the young double slit experiment ) the _ only _ mystery of interpretation of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "it is the same as what heisenberg earlier called ` the center of the whole quantum theory '  @xcite .",
    "although it is not possible to ` explain ' the fundamental formula ( 2.4 ) in terms of our understanding of space , time and causality in the world of everyday experience , it is at least possible to _ state _ how the classical formula ( 2.3 ) differs from the quantum mechanical one ( 2.4 ) that describes the real world .",
    "both ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) make predictions for probabilities concerning a statistical ensemble of experiments in which @xmath9 is allowed to vary for fixed values of @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "both predictions are ` probabilistic ' .",
    "it is not the case that the classical formula is deterministic and the quantum one probabilisitic .",
    "however , the classical formula is probabilistic because the value of @xmath9 , although existing , ( i.e. corresponding to a physically existing trajectory of a particle or a definite time - ordered sequence of space - time events ) is not known , whereas for the quantum formula the value of @xmath9 is not simply unknown , _ but in principle unknowable _ , without destroying the assumed experimental conditions .",
    "the probabilistic nature of the quantum formula is therefore not a consequence of simple ignorance of the values of some actually - existing physical parameter .",
    "the logical basis of ( 2.3 ) is that , in the different experiments of the ensemble , each one corresponds to a unique value of @xmath9 .",
    "say @xmath17 for one experiment and @xmath18 for another , corresponding , according to ( 2.2 ) to the conditional probabilities @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which are added in as contributions to the overall probability in ( 2.3 ) .",
    "that is , each value of @xmath9 corresponds to a distinct causal chain in space - time which may be called a ` classical history ' . on the other hand , in ( 2.4 ) , different values of @xmath9 _ contribute to every measurement of _",
    "@xmath5 , as if , loosely speaking , the quantum system is simultaneously occupying all possible intermediate states allowed by the experimental configuration .",
    "however , the conventional notions of space and time must still be applied to calculate correctly the path amplitudes @xmath16 , i.e. particles of known identity and kinematical properties are assumed to be produced , destroyed or scattered and _ to propagate in space - time according to the classical laws of space - time geometry and kinematics_. particle concepts are therefore essential to calculate the path amplitudes and any ` wave ' concept is irrelevant .",
    "this will become clear in the specific space - time experiments to be discussed in the following sections .",
    "when the path amplitudes @xmath16 are combined , according to the superposition law ( 2.5 ) , to give the quantum probability amplitude @xmath21 , the modulus squared of which gives the probability to measure the state @xmath22 when the state @xmath23 is prepared , but the experimental configration allows all members of the set of intermediate states @xmath24 , there is a breakdown of the correspondence between different values of @xmath9 and different classical histories which occurs in ( 2.3 ) .",
    "quantum mechanical superposition requires that amplitudes ( not probabilities ) for different classical histories are added to form the overall probability amplitude for the experiment , like the simultaneous overlapping of different melodies ( each one musically coherent ) in musical counterpoint .",
    "it is as though the unique causal chain of classical physics is replaced , in constructing the probability amplitude , by an , in general , infinite number of such chains in one - to - one correspondence with the path amplitudes when a _ single measurement _ of the final state @xmath22 is performed .",
    "this is reminiscent of everett s ` many worlds ' interpretation  @xcite except that the correspondence is between the one unique actual world described by quantum mechanics and all the different distinct classical histories that must be considered in the calculation of the overall probability amplitude for an experiment .",
    "the essentially non - classical ( and counter intuitive ) aspect of the situation is that a correspondence exists between a _",
    "single _ observed quantum system ( for example the photon or electron discussed in the following sections of the present paper ) and _ all _ path amplitudes consistent with the experimental configuration .",
    "the fundamental formula ( 2.4 ) generalises , by iteration , to give  @xcite : @xmath25 the quantity @xmath26 is the probability to observe any one of the set of final states @xmath27 : @xmath28 , @xmath29 when any one of the set of initial states @xmath30 : @xmath31 , @xmath32 is prepared and where @xmath33,@xmath34, ... @xmath35",
    "are intermediate states that are unobserved , but which must be specified in order to calculate the path amplitude : @xmath36 three fundamental quantum mechanical laws  @xcite are incorporated in ( 2.6 ) :    * the born probability interpretation of the amplitudes : @xmath37 * sequential factorisation of temporally - ordered amplitudes : @xmath38 * superposition of the path amplitudes @xmath16 : @xmath39    notice that matrix mutiplication , introduced into quantum mechanics by heisenberg  @xcite and refined by the work of born and jordan  @xcite and by dirac in his ` transformation theory '  @xcite , is axiomatically embodied in the laws ii and iii .",
    "a fourth important quantum mechanical law is applicable when the initial and final states are tensor products such as @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "such states occur in experiments where two or more particles are detected in coincidence in the final state .",
    "such experiments are conventionally described as having an ` entangled wavefunction '  @xcite . in the case that there are no intermediate states in common in the path amplitudes @xmath42 , @xmath43 , the probability amplitude is given by the law :    * composite factorisation : @xmath44    since there is no discussion , in the present paper , of experiments with entangled wavefunctions , no applications of ( 2.11 ) are considered . a brief discussion of composite factorisation in the annihilation of para - positronium : @xmath45 may be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the laws i - iv above describe simply how probability amplitudes are to be constructed and interpreted .",
    "they have no dynamical content .",
    "feynman  @xcite , restricting his discussion to the trajectories of particles in space - time , introduced dynamics into the problem , following dirac  @xcite , in the second of the two postulates :    * if an ideal measurement is performed to determine whether a particle has a path lying in a region of spacetime , the probability that the result will be affirmative is the absolute square of a sum of complex contributions , one from each path in the region . *",
    "the paths contribute equally in magnitude but the phase of their contribution is the classical action ( in units of @xmath46 ) i.e. the time integral of the lagrangian taken along the path .",
    "these postulates give the following law specifiying the probability amplitude , @xmath47 , that a particle , initially , at time @xmath48 , at position @xmath49 , will be found at later time @xmath50 , at position @xmath51 , having followed the spacetime paths : @xmath52 $ ] , @xmath53 :    * the feynman path integral : @xmath54 ) }                   { \\hbar } \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 ) \\equiv \\int_{t_a}^{t_b}l([\\vec{x}^{(j)}(t ) ] , t)dt.\\ ] ]    in ( 2.12 ) @xmath56 is a ( possibly space - time dependent ) normalisation factor .",
    "a particular path @xmath57 $ ] is specified by an array of space - time coordinates .",
    "considering one spatial dimension : @xmath58 : & ~ x_a^{(j ) } , t_a^{(j)};~x_1^{(j ) } , t_1^{(j)};~x_2^{(j ) } , t_2^{(j)};.~.~.            ~x_n^{(j ) } , t_n^{(j)};.~.~.~x_b^{(j ) } , t_b^{(j ) } \\nonumber \\\\            &    &   t_a^{(j)}<t_1^{(j)}<~t_2^{(j)}.~.~.<~t_n^{(j)}.~.~.~<~t_b^{(j)}. \\nonumber           \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that the velocity argument , @xmath59 , of the lagrangian is implicit in the specification of the path @xmath60 $ ] : @xmath61    this completes the presentation of the laws of feynman s formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "all the laws are equally valid in both the non - relativistic and relativistic limits . indeed a prime motivation for dirac s introduction , in ( 2.12 ) , of the lagrangian was to enable the construction of a relativistic theory , which is not possible in a hamiltonian - based formulation due to the lack of symmetry between temporal and spatial coordinates .",

    "the kernel can then be written in a ` wave - like ' manner as : @xmath83 where the last member of ( 3.8 ) shows the functional dependence of @xmath84 on @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "it consists of a part that exists in the real world ( e.g. the earth - moon system ) and is _ described by _ an abstract mathematical entity ( e.g. a lagrangian ) from which its space - time behaviour ( its motion ) can be derived . for a quantum mechanical system ,",
    "say a particle moving in a region of known potential energy , there is also a part that exists in the real world ( the particle and the source of the potential ) as well as the probability amplitude , which is a useful mathematical abstraction , from which statistical information on the space - time evolution of the system can be derived .",
    "it turns out that , in feynman s formulation , the essential ingredient of the probability amplitude is , according to the law v , the same as for the classical example , the ( classical ) lagrangian function of the system .",
    "in fact as pointed out by dirac  @xcite , the classical motion is recovered from the probability amplitude in the limit @xmath346 where @xmath347 is the minimum size of any quantity with dimensions of action that enters into the physical description of the system under consideration .",
    "the ontological confusion of statements like ` an electron sometimes behaves like a particle , and sometimes behaves like a lagrangian ' or ` an electron is sometimes a particle and sometimes a lagrangian ' is quite evident . in fact",
    "an electron _ is _ always a particle and its motion in space - time is always _ described _ by an appropriate ( classical ) lagrangian in both classical and quantum mechanics in the space - time formulation due to dirac and feynman .",
    "quite simply , in this case , there is no ontological duality .",
    "the failure of the matrix mechanics and wave mechanics formulations to incorporate space - time concepts in a transparent manner , as well as the ontological confusion between ` particles ' and ` waves ' which has persisted until the time of this writing is primarily due to two circumstances : ( 1 ) because of the quantitative success of the 19th century classical wave theory of light as developed by young , fresnel and others , as well as maxwell s identification of light with electromagnetic waves , the concept of ` light waves ' was already firmly woven into the fabric of physics at the time of the advent of quantum mechanics.(2 ) the problem which was addressed by the pioneers of quantum mechanics the theory of atomic structure and atomic radiative transitions was one one in which space - time concepts play no essential role . as correctly remarked by bohr  @xcite :    for example , the experiments regarding the excitation of spectra by electronic impacts and by radiation are adequately accounted for on the assumption of discrete stationary states and individual transition processes .",
    "this is primarily due to the circumstance that in these questions no closer description of the space - time behaviour of the processes is required .",
    "indeed , the wavefunction concept and the schrdinger equation are essential for the quantum description of atomic states and atomic transitions ( which may be characterised as ` quantum statics ' ) but they are , unlike the probability amplitude of feynman s formulation , ill - adapted to the description of dynamical experiments where space - time ideas are primordial , such as those described in sections 4 , 5 and 6 above or  @xcite .    another subject to be found in typical quantum mechanical text books is ` measurement theory ' based on projection operators in an abstract hilbert space , following the methodology introduced by von neumann in the early 1930 s  @xcite . ` measurement '",
    "is defined as the projection of an eigenfunction out of some general hilbert space state vector .",
    "for example :    ... we see that a measurement always causes a system to jump into an eigenstate of the dynamical variable that that is being measured , theeigenvalue of this eigenstate being equal to the result of the measurement .    in the case of the experiments described in ref .",
    "@xcite and in sections 4 and 5 above ` measurement ' ( i.e. detection of the photon ) does not produce a photon in ` an eigenstate of position ' but simply destroys it .",
    "the electrons which are detected in the faraday box of the davisson - germer experiment are also not left in ` position eigenstates ' after detection .",
    "to state the situation bluntly , the basic concepts of text book quantum mechanical ` measurement theory ' , although mathematically elegant , have little direct applicability to most real - world experiments .",
    "rigorous conclusions are obtained within a limited , well - defined , but abstract model .",
    "however this model is , in general , too simplistic to address the complexity of actual , real world , experiments like those considered in sections 5 and 6 above .",
    "a cat is penned up in a steel chamber along with the following diabolical device ( which must be secured against direct influence by the cat ) : in a geiger counter there is a tiny bit of radioactive substance so small that  _ perhaps _  in the course of one hour one of the atoms decays , but also , with equal probability , perhaps none ; if it happens , the counter tube discharges and through a relay releases a small hammer which shatters a small flask of hydrocyanic acid .",
    "if one has left this entire system to itself for an hour one would say that the cat still lives  _ if _",
    "meanwhile no atom has decayed.the first atomic decay would have poisoned it .",
    "the @xmath348 function of the entire system would express this by having in it the living and dead cat ( pardon the expression ) mixed , or smeared out in equal parts .",
    "( italics in the orginal )    the conditions of the experiment are met by considering a single radioactive atom of mean lifetime @xmath349  hr .",
    "what is relevant here is not ` the @xmath348 function of the entire system ' but the time - dependent transition amplitude : @xmath350 of the decay process where @xmath6 and @xmath5 are the initial and final states of the unstable radioactive nucleus .",
    "using ( 4.9 ) and ( 2.8 ) the probability that the cat is still alive after a time interval @xmath86 is : @xmath351 where @xmath352 is the delay time , determined by a chain of events related by classical causality , after the decay of the radioactive atom , before the cat actually dies .",
    "the cat is dead at , or after , the time interval @xmath86 if the atom decays within the time interval @xmath353 so that : @xmath354 since the atom either decays , or does not decay , within the time interval @xmath353 .",
    "the probabilities in ( 8.1 ) and ( 8.2 ) are independent of whether the chamber is opened or remains shut after the experiment , i.e. whether the cat is observable or not . at each instant during the experiment the cat is either alive or dead so its wavefunction is either @xmath355 or @xmath356 .",
    "schrdinger s putative wavefunction , after one hour , ( neglecting the delay @xmath352 ) of @xmath357/\\sqrt{2}$ ] therefore has no relevance to the analysis of the experiment .",
    "note that the quantum mechanical superposition evident in schrdinger s wavefunction plays no role in the derivation of the prediction ( 8.2 ) in feynman s formulation , much less ` entangled ' wavefunctions , that are appropriate only to quantum experiments with dual final states .",
    "consider paths a or b followed by a free particle of mass @xmath64 with velocities @xmath358 or @xmath359 .",
    "if the corresponding times of transit are @xmath48 , @xmath50 then the lengths of the paths are : @xmath360 , @xmath361 . with the definitions :",
    "it follows that @xmath363 if @xmath364 then the physically allowed regions of @xmath365 and @xmath366 are : @xmath367 the conditions @xmath246 and @xmath368 correspond to equal transit times . also of particular interest",
    "is the condition : @xmath369 which can be seen , from ( a.2 ) , to correspond to equal velocities @xmath370 .",
