    "field theories can be constructed from three kinds of pictures which are called heisenberg , interaction and schrdinger pictures [ 1 ] . among them , the heisenberg picture is known to provide a convenient basis for the study of dynamics of operators and systematic perturbative improvement on physical quantities . on the other hand ,",
    "the schrdinger picture approach focuses on the dynamics of wavefunction , which allows detailed study on time evolution .",
    "however , in this approach , it is known that systematic improvement on obtained result is rather difficult .",
    "instead , it has a powerful technique which is called a variational method which allows nonperturbative access to problems , so that it could be applied to strongly correlated systems where perturbative approaches break down",
    ".    there have been successful applications of the schrdinger picture to field theories [ 2 - 8 ] and later on to nonrelativistic many - particle systems [ 9 - 15 ] . while it has been proved useful , still the controlable range of trial wavefunctionals has been found to be narrow and further improvement from results of a trial wavefunctional demands much endeavor in field theories .",
    "therefore , recent investigations on the picture have focused on overcoming its drawbacks towards a more managable theory .",
    "gaussian trial wavefunctional apporach in bose fields has been widely applied and proven to be an efficient and powerful method in the schrdinger picture [ 3,8 ] .",
    "further improvements beyond the gaussian approxiamtion have been investigated mostly in two directions .",
    "one is to try it with non - gaussian wavefunctionals [ 16,17 ] , and the other is to perform appropriate expansions based on gaussian trial wavefunctional [ 18 - 24 ] .    in fermi fields , a convenient prescription for operators",
    "was proposed by floreanini and jackiw [ 5 ] .",
    "it was shown that this approach gives successful results on gaussian approximations of fermi fields as in bose fields . however ,",
    "in contrast to the bosonic case [ 1 ] , no successful rayleigh - schrdinger type perturbation formalism for fermi fields has been proposed so far , although several alternative schemes including functional integrals [ 25 ] and background field methods [ 8 ] have been reported using the floreanini - jackiw representation(fjr ) .",
    "since the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation formalism is the most familiar form of perturbation theories and especially suitable for the schdinger picture representation in quantum mechanics , it is rather puzzling that it is not so in field theories .",
    "indeed , the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation scheme for bose fields was formulated early [ 1 ] . however , for fermi fields , grassmann nature of functional variables has not allowed no such straighforward formalism as for bose fields .    in this paper , we present a successful perturbation formalism for fermionic many - body systems combining the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation with goldstone s ( rsg ) expansion .",
    "the scheme will be used to formulate a variational perturbation scheme , which provides a systematic improvement beyond the gaussian approximation . in order to make the presentation compact , we directly formulate a rsg perturbation scheme based on the variational gaussian wavefunctionals .",
    "the formalism is trivially reduced to the conventional perturbation scheme by using a true gaussian vacuum instead of an effective gaussian vacuum .",
    "this point will be made clear once the formalism is given .",
    "it will be shown that the fjr provides surprisingly simple expressions for fermion wavefunctionals . as examples ,",
    "we calculate the first order correction to the gaussian wavefunctional and the second order energy of an electron gas with the yukawa - type interaction .",
    "the action of fermi field operators on hilbert space can be represented by product or derivatives of grassmann variables in the grassmann function space .",
    "then , schrdinger equations are transformed into functional differential equations [ 1 ] . among many possible representations preserving the anticommuting relations of fermi field operators ,",
    "the simplest one is generated from the fermion coherent states which are defined as eigenstates of annihilation operators [ 26 ] . in this representation ,",
    "annihilation operators \\{@xmath0 } are described by grassmann variables \\{@xmath1 } , and creation opeators \\{@xmath2 } , by grassmann derivatives \\{@xmath3}. a representation without a complex conjugate notation @xmath4 is also possible and has been used by duncan et al .",
    "[ 4,9 ] . however , we find that the representation proposed by floreanini and jackiw is more convenient to formulate the present theory .    in the fjr ,",
    "the creation and annihilation operators are given as follows [ 5 ] ; @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath1 are grassmann variables . in the fjr for free fermi systems ,",
    "vacuums are described by gaussian wavefunctionals just as for bosonic systems . however , the norms between basis states for the fjr are not orthogonal since @xmath7 .",
    "it can be proven by the fact that four kinds of states relative to a quantum number @xmath8 are possible .",
    "they are represented by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath6 and @xmath11 . actually , only two kinds of physical states for @xmath8 exist .",
    "one is the occupied state by a fermion and the other unoccupied .",
    "thus , the fjr is a reducible representation and only a subspace of the total grassmann functional space can be used to describe physically well - defined wavefunctionals .",
    "the subspace can be constructed only after a physical vacuum wavefunctional is chosen .",
    "the dual space wavefunctional @xmath12 for the wavefunctional @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 \\psi e^{{{u}_{i}'}^ * u_i - { u}_{i}^ * { u}_{i } ' } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the norm is calculated by @xmath15\\bar{\\psi } \\psi$ ] .",
    "it can be easily shown that the free fermion vacuum is described by gaussian wavefunctional [ 5 ] as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and we find the dual wavefunctional is also gaussian .",
    "gaussian expectation values of some normal ordered operators are calculated as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an identity matrix and @xmath20 are source fields which are inserted into the gaussian wavefunctional as @xmath21 during the calculation .",
    "it allows that the grassmann integrals are represented by grassmann derivatives of source fields .    for the free field hamiltonian , @xmath22 ,",
    "the functional schrdinger equation in the fjr is @xmath23 this equation contains second order derivatives and a quadratic term which are similar to the harmonic oscillator problem .",
    "thus , we expect the gaussian wavefunctional , eq.(3 ) , as a vacuum . in order for eq.(3 ) to be an eigenfunctional with an eigenvalue @xmath24 in eq.(6 ) , @xmath25 should satisfy the following condition ; @xmath26 eq.(7 ) has trivial and non - trivial solutions .",
    "trivial solutions are @xmath27 and non - trivial ones , @xmath28 . here",
    ", we note that the number of particles @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 can be expressed as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a chemical potential .",
    "diagonalized , diagonal elements of @xmath25 become @xmath9(-1 ) below(above ) @xmath32 . in the case of free dirac fields , @xmath32 is zero and all the negative energy states are fully filled in the dirac vacuum .",
    "when interactions between fermions exist , exact eigenfunctionals are different from the above gaussian .",
    "variational method or perturbation theory is applied in order to approximate true eigenfunctionals .",
    "although the variational method depends largely on intuition in contrast to the systematic perturbative approach , it could provide excellent results if trial states are chosen carefully .    in the gaussian approximation , gaussian wavefunctional with variational parameters",
    "is used as a trial functional .",
    "we now consider the case of interacting fermion system where the hamiltonian has a general form , @xmath33 trial wavefunctional is chosen to be @xmath34 where @xmath25 is a variational parameter matrix .",
    "then , the energy expectation value is readily calculated with the aid of eq.(5 ) .",
    "@xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "minimization of the energy under a fixed number of particles is achieved through the relation , @xmath38=0 $ ] , where @xmath32 , the chemical potential , is introduced as a lagrange s multiplier .",
    "thus , the solution @xmath25 should satisfy the following condition ; @xmath39 the equivalent condition for @xmath40 is obtained by minimizing with respect to @xmath41 , and is given by @xmath42 which provides the same @xmath25 as in eq.(11 ) .",
    "as in eq.(7 ) , the nontrivial solution @xmath25 of eq.(11 ) is given by @xmath43 with this solution , the ground state energy @xmath44 is given as @xmath45 .",
    "the parent hamiltonian @xmath46 which has the above gaussian vacuum is easily found to be @xmath47 . in order to obtain excitations based on the gaussian wavefunctional",
    ", we should have a unitary matrix @xmath48 which diagonalizes @xmath25 as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a diagonal matrix with elements of + 1(-1 ) below(above ) the fermi level @xmath32 .",
    "thus , @xmath25 can be rewritten as follows ; @xmath51 therefore , we obtain an expression for @xmath48 , @xmath52 the gaussian wavefunctional is diagonalized by the new grassmann variables @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we use capital(small ) letters above(below ) the fermi see , so that @xmath55 we define new creation and annihilation operators as follows ; @xmath56 excited wavefunctionals and their duals are obtained by these operations to the gaussian as @xmath57 which has an excitation energy of @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the @xmath8th matrix element of @xmath60 .",
    "we note here that any physical wavefunctional in the fjr could be represented by multiplying only some combinations of @xmath61 and @xmath62 to the gaussian , while in other representations , wavefunctionals should also contain grassmann derivatives for describing hole states and , thus , are quite complicated in general .",
    "an important aspect of the present result is that eqs.(17 ) and ( 18 ) have same structures to those in bose systems [ 1 ] .",
    "in order to go beyond the gaussian approximation by a perturbative method based on the parent hamiltonian @xmath46 , hamiltonian is rearranged as @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . here , we note that the whole formalism simply reduces to the conventional perturbation if @xmath67 is set to zero . in the previous section ,",
    "we have already obtained whole spectrums of eigenvalues and eigenfunctionals of the parent hamiltonian @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation procedure [ 1 ] can be readily adopted for improving the gaussian approximation . however , in order to carry out the calculation , it is necessary to have a general rule for combination of grassmann operations which is similar to wick s theorem of the green function approach . in the following ,",
    "we show that another perturbative approach in the time independent formulation , namely goldstone s expansion [ 27 ] , becomes an extremely useful tool in the present approach .",
    "since final results from goldstone s expansion are same as from the rayleigh - schrdinger scheme order by order , we follow the goldstone s approach to obtain the expressions for the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation .",
    "goldstone s expansion is as follows .",
    "if @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , then @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 is normalized as @xmath74 .",
    "the prime in summation represents exclusion of terms with zero denominators and subscripts @xmath75 and @xmath76 represent @xmath77 and @xmath78 diagrams respectively .",
    "the @xmath78 has the same meaning as in other many - particle theories . however , the @xmath77 diagrams in the goldstone s usage are such that even when some diagrams have unconnected parts , if unconnected parts all have external lines , then , the diagrams are treated @xmath77 .",
    "let s expand the exact ground state wavefunctional @xmath13 in terms of the renormalized interaction , @xmath79 .",
    "it gives @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",
    "then , the @xmath82th order wavefunctional is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 \\bar{\\psi}_g \\psi$ ] = @xmath84 \\bar{\\psi}_g \\psi_g$ ] is satisfied .    in order to represent explicitly the grassmann wavefunctional , we use the following useful relations .",
    "when capital(small ) letters are defined for states above(below ) the fermi see , that is , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we arrive at simple commuting relations as follows , @xmath87 these commuting relations will be shown to reduce calculational efforts substantially in the fjr .",
    "we further define @xmath88 and @xmath8 for notational simplicity as @xmath89 where explicit forms of @xmath88 and @xmath8 in the right - hand side are defined through eq.(23 ) according to their position in the fermi see . then , we obtain @xmath90 the right - hand side above consists of combinations of grassmann variables and grassmann derivatives .",
    "we can easily see that if there is no @xmath91 ( @xmath1 ) on the right - hand side of @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) , it should be zero .",
    "@xmath94 is defined as a grassmann derivative result which is expressed by @xmath95 self - contractions of bare interaction , @xmath96 are canceled out by @xmath97 because @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , the interaction term can be simply expressed as @xmath99 where the prime means that contractions should be performed with elements outside @xmath100 . with this prime notation ,",
    "the wavefunctional is expressed as @xmath101   \\nonumber \\\\         & & \\times \\left [ \\left ( ( \\bar{i}_1 \\bar{j}_1 k_1 l_1 ) ' ( \\bar{i}_2 \\bar{j}_2 k_2 l_2 ) '    \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot ( \\bar{i}_n \\bar{j}_n k_n l_n ) ' \\right)_l \\right ]      , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 means excitation energy .",
    "each index in the second square bracket in eq.(29 ) could be a grassmann variable or a grassmann derivative .",
    "therefore , in order to be non - zero , all derivatives should be contracted out with corresponding variables and finally remaining elements should be grassmann variables only .",
    "they are summarized as follows : ( i ) the following steps are repeated for each @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "( ii ) a possible set of @xmath104 pairs of bar and non - bar indices is selected .",
    "self - contractions are forbidden and isolated parts fully connected by contractions are also excluded .",
    "( iii ) each contraction has the value given by eq.(26 ) or eq.(27 ) . if odd numbers of permutations are performed for contraction , ( -1 ) is multiplied .",
    "remaining indices without contraction are converted by @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "( iv ) all other possible @xmath104 contractions are performed .",
    "then , @xmath107 is calculated by multiplying the first square bracket term of eq.(29 ) to each contraction term and finally by summing out all indices .",
    "the corresponding @xmath82th order energy @xmath108 is calculated as @xmath109 \\bar{\\psi}_g ( h-\\tilde{h}_0 ) \\psi_n } { \\int d[u^ * u ] \\bar{\\psi}_g \\psi_g } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum { } ^ { ' } { \\tilde{v}_{i_1",

    "as well as energy values , gaussian expectation values of any operators like @xmath110 are also simply expressed in the fjr as follows , @xmath111 e^{g_{ij}u_i^ * u_j } { \\cal o}(\\tilde{a}_i^\\dagger , \\tilde{a}_j , \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot )   e^{g_{ij}u_i^ * u_j }   } { \\int d[u^ * u ] e^{2 g_{ij}u_i^ * u_j } } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\int d[u^ * u ] e^{2 g_{ij}u_i^ * u_j } { \\cal o}(\\bar{i } , j , \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot ) } { \\int d[u^ * u ] e^{2 g_{ij}u_i^ * u_j } } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & { \\cal o}(\\bar{i } , j , \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot ) |_{u^ { * } , u = 0 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 should be the variational solution , eq.(12 ) , and the notational abbreviations , eq.(16 ) and ( 24 ) are also used .",
    "the third line of eq.(31 ) is equivalent to the full contractions allowing unconnected ones .    as examples ,",
    "we calculate the first order wavefunctional @xmath112 and the second order energy @xmath113 .",
    "if we use capital(small ) letters above(below ) the fermi see in the correction parts , they are represented as @xmath114 @xmath115 here , we note that @xmath116 is always zero and @xmath112 has no terms like @xmath117 because self - contraction is forbidden .    in the case of electron gas ,",
    "the quantum numbers are usual wavevector @xmath118 and spin @xmath119 and the interaction has a form , @xmath120 for a homogeneous case , the gaussian variational solution @xmath25 of eq.(12 ) is already diagonalized by @xmath121 representation .",
    "therefore , we can use the grassmann variables @xmath122 as basis states instead of @xmath123 .",
    "the energy component of parent hamiltonian @xmath46 is calculated as @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the free electron energy band and @xmath126 is the fermi distribution function at zero temperature .",
    "thus , we finally have @xmath127 @xmath128 the first order wavefunctional has a very simple form and higher order ones are also expected to have such simple forms in this variational fjr .",
    "we find that the above ground state energy is same as the zero temperature limit of the variational perturbation theory [ 25 ] previously obtained from a functional integral representation , because gaussian approximations of both representations employed same variational basis .",
    "for a numerial energy value , we modeled an electron gas with a bare kinetic energy @xmath129 and a yukawa - type interaction @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the bare electron mass and the charge , and @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the system volume and the bohr s radius respectively .",
    "@xmath135 , and @xmath136 are parameters to modulate the mass , charge and interaction range . in fig.1 , we plot the second order contribution to the ground state energy as a function of @xmath137 , which is the average distance ratio between electrons defined by @xmath138 .",
    "we find the second order contribution is much reduced in the present variationl procedure than the conventional one which usually gives exceedingly negative result .",
