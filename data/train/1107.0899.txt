    "the r - process , or rapid neutron - capture process , of stellar nucleosynthesis is invoked to explain the production of the stable ( and some long - lived radioactive ) neutron - rich nuclides heavier than iron , which are observed in stars of different metallicities as well as in the solar system ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "despite a growing wealth of observational data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and although increasingly better r - process models with new astrophysical or nuclear physics ingredients have been developed over decades , the stellar production site(s ) of r - process material has ( have ) not been identified yet .",
    "all proposed scenarios face serious problems .",
    "supernovae ( sne ) , for example , appear attractive because of their potential to explain observational features of the galactic chemical enrichment history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "early in the development of the theory of nucleosynthesis , an alternative origin of r - process nuclei was proposed @xcite .",
    "it relies on the fact that at high densities ( typically @xmath8 g@xmath9 ) matter tends to be composed of nuclei lying on the neutron - rich side of the valley of nuclear stability as a result of endothermic free - electron captures .",
    "the astrophysical plausibility of this production mechanism as the source of the observed r - nuclides has long been questioned .",
    "it remained largely unexplored until @xcite and @xcite studied the decompression of cold , neutronized matter ejected by tidal effects of a black hole ( bh ) on a neutron star ( ns ) companion .",
    "recently , special attention has been paid to ns mergers because hydrodynamic simulations of ns - ns and ns - bh mergers showed that a non - negligible amount of matter may be ejected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all previous investigations of the ejecta from coalescing nss @xcite were parametrized in one way or another , which makes their results and conclusions subject to open questions . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the thermodynamic profiles were constructed by a simple decompression model ( see * ? ? ? * ) , but the neutron enrichment ( or equivalently the electron fraction @xmath10 ) was consistently taken from @xmath11-equilibrium assumed to have been achieved at the initial density prior to the decompression .",
    "it was found that the final composition of the material ejected from the inner crust depends on the initial density , at least for the outer parts of the inner crust at @xmath12g/@xmath13 ( where @xmath144.2@xmath1510@xmath16g/@xmath13 is the neutron - drip density ) .",
    "for the deeper inner - crust layers ( @xmath17 ) , large neutron - to - seed ratios drive the nuclear flow into the very heavy - mass region , leading to multiple fission recycling . as a consequence ,",
    "the resulting abundance distribution becomes independent of the initial conditions , especially of the initial density .",
    "it was found to be in close agreement with the solar distribution for @xmath18 nuclei @xcite .",
    "different approaches were taken to nucleosynthesis calculations for merger ejecta by @xcite and @xcite . in their calculations , while the density evolution of the mass elements was adopted from hydrodynamical simulations , both the initial neutron enrichment and the temperature history were considered as free parameters . in particular , @xmath10 was chosen in order to obtain , after decompression , an r - abundance distribution as close as possible to the solar distribution .",
    "this led to values of @xmath19 @xcite or 0.2 @xcite , corresponding to relatively near - surface layers of the inner crust and to nuclear flows that are not subject to multiple fission cycles . in our simulations ,",
    "most of the ejecta mass originates from the deep layers of the inner crust so that any contribution from near - surface layers remains minor .",
    "in addition , previous studies assumed that the nucleosynthesis is independent of the initial temperature of the ejected material , while we find that the initial temperature may not only affect the initial composition , but potentially also the nucleosynthesis ( see sect .  [ sect_in ] ) so that special attention should be paid to the detailed temperature history of the ejected material prior to its free expansion .",
    "the work presented here is based on recent three - dimensional relativistic simulations of ns - ns mergers to determine the nucleosynthesis - relevant conditions of the ejected matter .",
    "the hydrodynamical model is described in sect .",
    "[ sect_hydro ] .",
    "section [ sect_in ] presents the nucleosynthesis results for two binaries , a symmetric ns - ns system and an asymmetric one .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , detailed information about the density , @xmath10 , and entropy evolution of the ejecta is extracted from the hydrodynamical simulations and included in the network calculations .",
    "the expected electromagnetic emission that is powered by radioactive decays following the heavy - element nucleosynthesis is estimated by a simple , approximative light - curve model in sect .",

    "ns merger simulations were performed with a general relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics scheme @xcite representing the fluid by a set of particles with constant rest mass , whose hydrodynamical properties were evolved according to lagrangian hydrodynamics , keeping @xmath10 of fluid elements fixed .",
    "the einstein field equations were solved assuming a conformally flat spatial metric .",
    "binaries with two mass ratios were modeled , namely symmetric 1.35@xmath201.35@xmath20  and asymmetric 1.2@xmath201.5@xmath20  systems , both with a resolution of about 550,000 particles .",
    "the 1.35@xmath201.35@xmath20  case is of particular interest since , according to population synthesis studies and pulsar observations , it represents the most abundant systems @xcite .    for the results presented here we used the @xcite equation of state ( eos ) , which includes thermal effects that become important when the nss collide .",
    "the corresponding nss have radii of @xmath615 km ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to assess the eos influence on gross properties of the ejecta",
    ", we also performed simulations with the @xcite ls220 eos with an incompressibility modulus of 220  mev and a ns radius of @xmath612 km .",
    "note that both of our eoss are in agreement with the observation of a 2@xmath21 ns @xcite . since an accurate calculation of the temperature evolution in the hydrodynamic simulations is hampered by high initial degeneracy and limited numerical resolution , we postprocessed the temperature of each ejected fluid element by assuming an adiabatic flow in the absence of shocks and increasing the specific entropy ( consistent with the shock - jump conditions ) when a shock was detected .    in the case of the symmetric ns binary ,",
    "about 3@xmath22@xmath20   are found to become gravitationally unbound , whereas about 6@xmath22@xmath20  are ejected from the asymmetric system ( using the ls220 eos , we obtain an ejecta mass of @xmath62@xmath22@xmath20  and 6@xmath22@xmath20 respectively ) .",
    "the ejected `` particles '' ( i.e. , mass elements ) originate mostly from two different regions in the inner crust of the initial stars . for the symmetric model @xmath675% of the material",
    "are squeezed out from the contact interface of the nss .",
    "the remaining 25% are ejected from the near - surface regions close to the orbital plane , see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_histo ] , where the arrows indicate by trend which initial densities the majority of fluid elements corresponds to .",
    "note that the `` contact '' interface of the asymmetric merger is different from the symmetric case .",
    "while in the latter the two nss collide in a shearing way and violently along a broad area , the impact of the tidally stretched lower - mass companion in the asymmetric case happens in a more grazing way such that a conical `` nose '' of the lower - mass star digs off matter from the higher - mass object .",
    "for this reason , in the asymmetric system the contact region preferentially contributes to ejecta with low initial densities . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_histo ] , all ejecta have low @xmath10 ranging between 0.015 and 0.050 ( about 30% of the mass have @xmath23 ) . in the asymmetric case a small amount of ejected material starts out from densities above 2@xmath24 and has @xmath10-values up to 0.07 .",
    "for the first 27ms the density history is consistently followed by the numerical simulation .",
    "afterwards the escaping ejecta are assumed to expand freely with constant velocity .",
    "the radii of the ejecta clumps thus grow linearly with time @xmath25 and consequently their densities drop like @xmath26 .",
    "note that due to a lack of resolution the dynamics and mass of unbound crust material with initial densities @xmath27 can not be reliably calculated in the hydrodynamic model . however , compared to the @xmath1@xmath28@xmath20  of inner crust matter its contribution to the ejecta remains small .",
    "the ejected matter is initially cold , but most of it gets shock - heated during the ejection to temperatures above 1mev .",
    "its composition is then determined by nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) . when the drip density is reached during expansion",
    ", most of the matter has cooled below 1  mev and the nse composition has frozen out .",
    "as soon as the temperature has dropped below @xmath29  k , further changes of the composition are followed by a full network calculation ( as detailed below ) , and the temperature evolution is determined on the basis of the laws of thermodynamics , allowing for possible nuclear heating through @xmath11-decays , fission , and @xmath30-decays , as described in @xcite .",
    "the reaction network includes all 5000 species from protons up to z=110 lying between the valley of @xmath11-stability and the neutron - drip line .",
    "all fusion reactions on light elements that play a role when the nse freezes out are included in addition to radiative neutron captures and photodisintegrations .",
    "the reaction rates on light species are taken from the netgen library , which includes all the latest compilations of experimentally determined reaction rates @xcite .",

    "are also included , i.e neutron - induced fission , spontaneous fission , @xmath11-delayed fission , photofission , as well as @xmath11-delayed neutron emission .",
    "the @xmath11-decay processes are taken from the updated version of the gross theory @xcite based on the hfb-14 @xmath31-values , whereas all fission processes are estimated on the basis of the hfb-14 fission path and the full calculation of the corresponding barrier penetration @xcite .",
    "the main fission region is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_fission ] .",
    "the fission fragment distribution is taken from @xcite , and the fragment mass- and charge - asymmetry are derived from the hfb-14 prediction of the left - right asymmetry at the outer saddle point .",
    "due to the specific initial conditions of high neutron densities ( typically @xmath32 at the drip density ) , the nuclear flow during most of the neutron irradiation will follow the neutron - drip line .",
    "for these nuclei at @xmath333@xmath34  k , ( n,2n ) and ( 2n , n ) reactions are faster than ( @xmath35,n ) and ( n,@xmath35 ) reactions and must be included in the reaction network .",

    "[ fig_ab ] by the @xmath44 peak corresponding to the mass - symmetric fragment distribution .",
    "it is emphasized that significant uncertainties still affect the prediction of fission probabilities and fragment distributions so that the exact strength and location of the @xmath44 fission peak ( as well as the possible @xmath45 bump observed in the solar distribution ) depend on the adopted nuclear model .    while most of the matter trajectories are subject to a density and temperature history leading to the nuclear flow and abundance distribution described above , some mass elements can be shock - heated at relatively low densities . typically at @xmath46",
    "the coulomb effects shift the nse abundance distribution towards the high - mass region @xcite , but at lower densities , the high temperatures lead to the photodissociation of all the medium - mass seed nuclei into neutrons and protons .",
