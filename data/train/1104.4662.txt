    "wormholes are handles or tunnels in the geometry of spacetime connecting two distinct regions of our universe or of completely different universes .",
    "the pioneer work of morris and thorne @xcite has shown that , being solutions of the einstein field equations , macroscopic wormholes may be actual physical objects that could even be traversed by humanoid travelers . unlike black holes , which are also predictions of einstein s theory ,",
    "wormholes can only be held open by the use of  exotic \" matter ; such matter violates the weak energy condition .    because of the close connection between space and time , general relativity is able to tolerate science - fiction type phenomena such as wormholes and even time travel , as exemplified by the gdel solution .",
    "quantum field theory , on the other hand , is not so forgiving : it places severe restrictions on the existence of traversable wormholes @xcite . in fact , according to ford and roman @xcite , the wormholes discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite could not exist on a macroscopic scale .",
    "interesting exceptions are the wormholes discussed in refs . @xcite and @xcite , but they are subject to extreme fine - tuning .",
    "this fine - tuning became an issue in seeking compatibility with quantum field theory by a suitable extension of the quantum inequalities @xcite .",
    "given that exotic matter is rather problematical , the idea behind the extension was to strike a balance between reducing the size of the exotic region and the concomitant fine - tuning of the metric coefficients .",
    "one can only be accomplished at the expense of the other .",
    "a particularly interesting generalization of the morris - thorne wormhole can be obtained by the addition of an electric charge , as proposed by kim and lee @xcite .",
    "the resulting spacetime is a combination of a morris - thorne spherically symmetric static wormhole and a reissner - nrdstrom spacetime .",
    "as in the case of black holes , wormholes with an electric charge have been of interest for some time .",
    "for example , by adding an electric charge , gonzales , guzman , and sarbach @xcite studied the possibility of stabilizing a wormhole supported by a ghost scalar field , discussed in their earlier papers @xcite .    rotating and magnetized wormholes supported by phantom scalar fields are discussed in ref .",
    "( a ghost scalar field is often considered a simple example of phantom energy , which is itself of interest in a wormhole setting since it leads to a violation of the weak energy condition . )",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that a relatively small modification of the metric describing a charged wormhole suffices to satisfy an extended version of the ford - roman inequality , thereby making such a wormhole compatible with quantum field theory .",
    "the modified model is also a solution of the einstein field equations .",
    "the spacetime geometry of a traversable wormhole can be described by the metric    @xmath0    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 as @xmath3 and where @xmath4 has a continuous derivative .",
    "( we are using units in which @xmath5 . ) the function @xmath6 is called the _ redshift function _ , which must be everywhere finite to prevent an event horizon .",
    "the function @xmath7 is related to the _ shape function _ @xmath8 : @xmath9 so @xmath10 .",
    "( observe that @xmath11 is continuous and that @xmath12 as @xmath3 . )",
    "the minimum radius @xmath13 is called the _ throat _ of the wormhole , where @xmath14 . also , @xmath15 ,",
    "referred to as the _ flare - out condition _ in ref .",
    "it follows that @xmath16 has a vertical asymptote at @xmath13 : @xmath17    to hold a wormhole open , the weak energy condition ( wec ) must be violated .",
    "the wec states that the stress - energy tensor @xmath18 must obey @xmath19 for all time - like vectors and , by continuity , all null vectors .",
    "to make this paper reasonably self - contained , we need a brief discussion of the quantum inequalities due to ford and roman @xcite , slightly extended in @xcite .    in a series of papers , ford and roman ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) discuss a type of constraint on the violation of the weak energy condition by means of certain quantum inequalities which limit the magnitude and time duration of negative energy .",
    "these inequalities place severe restrictions on the dimensions of morris - thorne wormholes .",
    "one of these quantum inequalities , applied to different situations , deals with an inertial minkowski spacetime without boundaries . if @xmath20 is the observer s four - velocity , that is , the tangent vector to a timelike geodesic , then @xmath21 is the expectation value of the local energy density in the observer s frame of reference .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the observer s proper time and @xmath24 the duration of the sampling time .",
    "more precisely , the energy density is sampled in a time interval of duration @xmath24 which is centered around an arbitrary point on the observer s worldline so chosen that @xmath25 at this point .",
    "[ see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . ]    in a wormhole setting , a more convenient form is inequality ( [ e : qi3 ] ) below , as we will see .",
    "applied to spherically symmetric traversable wormholes in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that none were able to meet this condition . as a result",
    ", the throat sizes could only be slightly larger than planck length .",
    "the inequality was subsequently extended in refs .",
    "@xcite to cover an entire region around the throat .",
    "it was then shown that it is possible to strike a balance between the size of the exotic region and the amount of fine - tuning required to achieve this reduction .    before discussing the extended quantum inequality ,",
    "we need to introduce the following length scales , modeled after the length scales in ref .",
    "@xcite , which were introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath26.\\ ] ] it is shown that if @xmath27 is the magnitude of the maximum curvature , then @xmath28 . so the smallest radius of curvature @xmath29 is @xmath30 working on this scale , the spacetime is approximately minkowskian , so that inequality ( [ e : qi1 ] ) can be applied with an appropriate @xmath24 .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , whenever the density @xmath31 is positive or zero , one should lorentz transform to a frame of a radially moving geodesic observer moving with velocity @xmath32 relative to the static frame . in this",
    " boosted frame \" the density and maximum curvature are denoted by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",

    "@xcite : @xmath44 observe that inequality ( [ e : qi3 ] ) is trivially satisfied if @xmath45 , but not necessarily if @xmath46 .",

    "( [ e : qi2 ] ) could actually be omitted @xcite .",
    "the reason is that , according to ref .",
    "the boosted frame may be replaced by a static observer .",

    "the proposed metric is @xmath59    comparing metrics ( [ e : line1 ] ) and ( [ e : line2 ] ) , since @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 and since @xmath62 $ ] in ( [ e : line1 ] ) , it follows that the effective shape function @xmath63 is @xmath64 given the conversion factor @xmath65 , @xmath66 is likely to be small in geometrized units .",
    "accordingly , we will assume that @xmath67 in the vicinity of the throat .",
    "for reasons discussed later in this section , we are going to propose the following modified metric for a charged wormhole : @xmath68 it is assumed that @xmath69 , thereby avoiding an event horizon , and that @xmath70 has a continuous derivative . as in metric ( [ e : line2 ] ) , @xmath71 .",

    "@xcite , employing the effective shape function @xmath71 and assuming @xmath78 ( total matter ) in the original kim - lee model , yields a self - consistent solution of a system of equations similar to that of the scalar field case discussed earlier in ref .",
    "the inclusion of the smooth function @xmath70 does not alter this conclusion .",
    "so the metric ( [ e : line3 ] ) may be viewed as a solution of the einstein field equations representing a wormhole with an electric charge .",
    "returning to the wec , if we use the radial outgoing null vector @xmath79 , then @xmath80 . for the above components ,",
    "since @xmath81 and @xmath82 drop out , we have @xmath83 whenever the condition is violated .",
    "( we will examine this violation shortly . )    next , let us assume that @xmath8 is a typical shape function in the sense of morris and thorne @xcite : if the charge @xmath54 is zero , then the wormhole has a throat at @xmath84 , where @xmath85 . for @xmath86 , we must have @xmath87 .",
    "it follows that @xmath88 .",
    "( see fig . 1 . ) the new shape function @xmath89    [ eq .  ( [ e : beff ] ) ] has analogous properties : in particular , there is a throat at @xmath13 , that is , @xmath90 _ remark 2 : _ eq .",
    "( [ e : analogous ] ) actually has two roots , @xmath91 ^ 2 - 4q^2}\\right).\\ ] ] in the special case @xmath92 , we get two possibilities , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , showing that the smaller root is meaningless .",
    "we will therefore assume that there is only one throat , corresponding to the larger root .    for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , or @xmath97 .",
    "hence @xmath98 for @xmath95 .",
    "so we have , once again , @xmath99 . finally , the profile curve @xmath100 is such that @xmath101 showing that there is a vertical tangent at the throat @xmath13 in the usual embedding diagram . as noted at the end of sec .",

    "since we are using geometrized units , @xmath66 is likely to be small , so that @xmath50 is not much less than @xmath106 .",

    "this is consistent with the violation of the wec , @xmath83 : @xmath109.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] at the throat , @xmath110 by inequality ( [ e : flare1 ] ) .",
    "in order to study the feasibility of the charged wormhole , let us denote the redshift function in the kim and lee wormhole by @xmath111 .",
    "thus @xmath112    recall next that inequality ( [ e : qi3 ] ) is trivially satisfied if @xmath113 at the throat . for either of the charged wormholes ,",
    "if @xmath54 is chosen properly , the condition can be met : from eq .",
    "( [ e : beff ] ) , @xmath114 so for a proper choice of @xmath54 , @xmath115 , even if @xmath116 is less than 1 .    to study the problem more closely ,",
    "let us restate inequalities ( [ e : velocity ] ) and ( [ e : qi2 ] ) for @xmath63 : @xmath117 and @xmath118 as before , at the throat , inequality ( [ e : qi4 ] ) is trivially satisfied if @xmath119    problems arise when we move away from the throat .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for any of the typical shape functions ( which would include @xmath63 ) , @xmath120 .",
    "so for the wormhole in sec .",
    "[ s : kl ] , the denominator on the right side of inequality ( [ e : qi4 ] ) is no longer 0 , since @xmath121 is negative .",
    "furthermore , with @xmath54 fixed , @xmath122 can not be altered .",
    "it is easy to demonstrate using specific shape functions that the quantum inequalities can not be met away from the throat .    to salvage the charged wormhole ,",
    "some modification is evidently needed . with the reissner - nrdstrom metric in mind , eq .",
    "( [ e : line3 ] ) appears to be a natural generalization , as long as @xmath70 is not equal to @xmath123 . to distinguish this case from eq .",
    "( [ e : redshift1 ] ) , let us denote the modified redshift function by @xmath124 : @xmath125 the situation regarding the quantum inequalities is now quite different : @xmath126,\\ ] ] which is positive for a proper choice of @xmath70 . also , @xmath127 is continuous if , and only if , @xmath128 is continuous .",
    "we proceed by first showing that @xmath124 ( and hence @xmath70 ) can be constructed or adjusted to meet inequality ( [ e : qi4 ] ) away from the throat .",
    "suppose we start at the throat and return to the condition @xmath115 .",
    "then @xmath129 by inequality ( [ e : velocity2 ] ) , and inequality ( [ e : qi4 ] ) is trivially satisfied .",
    "moving away from the throat , the redshift function , now denoted by @xmath122 , can be adjusted so that inequality ( [ e : qi4 ] ) is still satisfied , i.e. , @xmath130 is 0 or close to 0 .",
    "assume that @xmath131 is continuous .",
    "( we also assume that the shape function is fairly typical in the sense of having a gradually decreasing slope , at least in the vicinity of the throat . )    substituting the newly determined @xmath122 in eq .",
    "( [ e : beta2 ] ) , we get after rearranging , @xmath132 the solution of the differential equation is @xmath133 the continuity of @xmath131 is sufficient to guarantee that @xmath70 is a solution . using integration by parts , the solution can be written @xmath134 showing that @xmath135 .",
    "so it is in principle possible to determine @xmath70 from @xmath122 such that inequality ( [ e : qi4 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the resulting wormhole will therefore become compatible with quantum field theory .",
    "there are several parameters that come into play when describing the wormhole geometry .",
    "in particular , @xmath136 and @xmath115 lead to @xmath137 and @xmath138 if @xmath139 and @xmath54 are known , we can determine @xmath50 .",
    "it is also possible to fix @xmath50 at some desired ( macroscopic ) value and determine @xmath139 and @xmath54 . as a simple example ,",
    "suppose @xmath139 has the form @xmath140 , @xmath141 . then from eqs .",
    "( [ e : condition1 ] ) and ( [ e : condition2 ] ) , we find that for nonzero @xmath54 , @xmath142 @xmath143 can be so chosen that @xmath66 is relatively small , as desired in our geometrized units .",
    "this also confirms our earlier assertion that @xmath50 can not be much smaller than @xmath106 without making @xmath66 unrealistically large .    as a check on the traversability by humanoid travelers ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , consider the proper distance @xmath144 from the throat to a point away from the throat : @xmath145 for @xmath140 and @xmath146 , this distance is finite . for example , if @xmath147 m , and @xmath148 , then @xmath149 140 m. however , if @xmath150 , then @xmath151 for this particular shape function , so that the wormhole would not be traversable .",
    "in this paper the charged wormhole described by the metric @xmath152 due to kim and lee is extended to @xmath153 where @xmath69 has a continuous derivative at the throat , and @xmath135 .",
    "the main objective was to show that @xmath70 can be so chosen that the quantum inequality ( [ e : qi4 ] ) is satisfied in the vicinity of the throat , thereby making the extended model compatible with quantum field theory .",
    "it is also shown that the flare - out condition has been satisfied and that an event horizon has been avoided .",
    "various combinations of @xmath139 , @xmath54 , and @xmath13 are possible and may be chosen to make the wormhole traversable by humanoid travelers .",
