    "monolayers of transition - metal dichalcogenides @xmath0 ( @xmath1 mo , w , @xmath2 s , se ) have attracted intense recent interest due to their unique optical and electronic properties .",
    "@xcite these two - dimensional materials can be regarded as semiconductor analog of graphene : their band structure consists of two degenerate but inequivalent valleys located at the corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone , with a direct band gap in the visible frequency range .",
    "@xcite it was predicted that ,  @xcite due to the lack of inversion center in the crystal structure , the two valleys can be distinguished by the berry phase of the bloch bands ,  @xcite which gives rise to the valley hall effect and valley - dependent optical selection rule .",
    "@xcite this prediction has motivated several recent experiments , in which the optical generation  @xcite and electric control  @xcite of valley polarization have been demonstrated .",
    "another interesting property of @xmath0 is the large spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) derived from the heavy metal @xmath3-orbitals .  @xcite it was pointed out that broken inversion symmetry",
    "also gives rise to a strong spin - valley coupling ,  @xcite i.e. , carriers in opposite valleys have opposite spin moment ( fig .",
    "[ fig : band_dispersion ] ) .",
    "this coupling has a number of implications .",
    "first , various valley - dependent phenomena now become spin - dependent . in particular ,",
    "the valley hall effect is accompanied by a spin hall effect , in which a transverse spin current can be generated by a longitudinal electric field .",
    "secondly , the spin - valley coupling dictates that intravalley scattering conserves the spin index whereas intervalley scattering necessarily flips it , resulting in prolonged spin lifetime in the diffusion regime .",
    "@xcite the intra- and inter - valley scattering also leads to opposite localization behavior .",
    "@xcite    .",
    "red ( blue ) curves represent bands with spin up ( down ) .",
    "black dashed line shows the fermi energy @xmath4 measured from the middle of the gap . ]    in general , the spin hall effect consists of both intrinsic and extrinsic contributions .",
    "the intrinsic part , determined by the berry curvature of the bloch bands ,  @xcite has been discussed for monolayer @xmath0 based on first - principles band - structure calculations .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , it is well known that impurity scattering could modify the intrinsic contribution as demonstrated in the rashba model .",
    "@xcite furthermore , impurity scattering itself may lead to extrinsic spin hall effect,@xcite including both skew - scattering  @xcite and side - jump  @xcite mechanisms . since the strong spin - valley coupling severely limits the possible scattering channels , it is important to investigate its role in the spin hall effect in @xmath0 monolayers .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the spin hall conductivity ( shc ) of @xmath0 monolayers .",
    "we find that symmetric vertex correction has little effect on the intrinsic contribution due to the large band gap .",
    "for the extrinsic mechanisms , the side - jump contribution is comparable to the intrinsic contribution , while the skew scattering contribution is suppressed by the large band gap for both scalar and magnetic scattering . in hole - doped samples ( fig .",
    "[ fig : band_dispersion ] ) , the sign of the shc is opposite for the side - jump and intrinsic contributions , and the side - jump contribution is always suppressed by intervalley scattering due to the loss of coherence .",
    "hence , by tuning the relative strength of intra- and intervalley scattering , the total shc shows a sign change , i.e. , it is negative for weak intervalley scattering and positive for strong intervalley scattering .",
    "our study is also extended to the multiband case when the system is electron- or heavily hole - doped ( such that the fermi energy crosses multiple bands ) .",
    "we find that the sign change exists in the hole - doped regime , but not in the electron - doped regime .",
    "therefore , the shc may provide another measure to determine the strength of intervalley scattering in hole - doped @xmath0 monolayers .",
