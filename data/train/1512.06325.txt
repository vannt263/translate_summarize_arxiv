    "a graph bisection is a partition of the vertex set into two parts of equal order , thereby creating two subgraphs .",
    "a bisection is considered good if the number of edges between the two partitions is small .",
    "finding the graph bisection that minimizes the number of edges between the two partitions is np - complete @xcite . despite this , graph bisections have found application in scientific computing , vlsi design , and task scheduling @xcite .",
    "a variety of heuristic algorithms have been implemented in an attempt to approximate the optimal graph bisection .",
    "one of the most popular techniques approximates the optimal cut via the zero level set of the discrete laplacian eigenvector corresponding to the smallest non - zero eigenvalue .",
    "naturally , such technique is called a spectral bisection .",
    "the efficient construction and the properties of spectral bisections is and has been an active area of research @xcite .",
    "experiments have shown that this technique works well in practice , and it has been proven that spectral bisection works well on bounded degree planar graphs and finite element meshes @xcite . for general graphs , however , this is not the case , and , in what follows , we show that spectral bisection is not a robust technique for approximating the optimal cut .",
    "in particular , we construct a special class of graphs for which the maximum error in the spectral approximation of the optimal bisection is bounded below by a constant multiple of the order squared .",
    "we begin the technical discussion by briefly introducing notation and definitions from graph theory , referring the readers to @xcite for details .",
    "let @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , be a simple , connected , undirected graph .",
    "the graph laplacian associated with @xmath3 is the matrix @xmath4 , defined via the following bilinear form @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the standard euclidean scalar product on @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the set of neighbors of @xmath9 ; namely , @xmath10 .",

    "we have that @xmath15 and @xmath16 for all graphs , and that @xmath17 for all connected graphs @xmath3 . the eigenvalue @xmath18 is known as the _ algebraic connectivity _ of @xmath3 , denoted by @xmath19 . the eigenvector @xmath20 is known as the fiedler vector , or _",
    "characteristic valuation _ of @xmath3 @xcite . when @xmath19 is a repeated eigenvalue of multiplicity @xmath21 , the fiedler vectors lie in the @xmath21-dimensional eigenspace corresponding to @xmath19 , denoted here by @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath3 is clear from the context , we will omit the argument `` @xmath23 '' in @xmath24 , @xmath25 and simply write @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "further , by @xmath28 we denote the indicator vector ( function ) of a set . for a subset @xmath29",
    "this function is defined as follows @xmath30_k = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } 1 , & k\\in w,\\\\ 0 , & k\\notin w.   \\end{array } \\right .",

    "for a vector @xmath41 , its median cut is defined as corresponding to the vector @xmath44 , where @xmath45    adopting notation from @xcite , we consider the graph partitioning problem , that is , partitioning @xmath39 into two disjoint sets @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , such that the edge cut ( number of the edges with one vertex in @xmath46 and one in @xmath47 ) is minimized . in the notation we just introduced , this is equivalent to @xmath50 the relation @xmath49 quite ambiguous , and one of the most common approaches to resolve this is to minimize over the sets @xmath51 . in what follows",

    ", we refer readers to @xcite .",
    "numerous techniques have been devised and aimed at approximating the optimal solution in polynomial time and are currently used in graph - partitioning software  @xcite .",
    "some of the techniques involve the use of a fiedler vector of the graph laplacian @xcite .",
    "miroslav fiedler , @xcite , proved many results about algebraic connectivity and its associated eigenvector .",

    "the approximation can be seen by noting that minimizing the rayleigh quotient of the laplacian over integer vectors is equivalent to minimizing the edge cut of the corresponding partition ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the case when @xmath58 is non - empty is more complicated and still provides a bisection , depending on how the zero valuated vertices in @xmath59 are distributed between @xmath46 and @xmath47 . for more details on such special cases ,",
    "we refer to  @xcite .",
    "in this section we show how far from optimal a spectral bisection can be .",
    "we note that the area of cut quality has been studied previously .",
    "spielman and teng showed that spectral partitioning performs well for bounded degree planar graphs @xcite .",
    "guattery and miller produced a class of graphs for which the error in cut quality of a spectral bisection is bounded below by a constant multiple of the order of the graph .",
    "in addition , they found estimates for how poorly spectral techniques can perform in the cut ratio partition @xcite .",
    "by contrast , our focus is solely on the bisection problem , and we aim to produce a lower bound of a constant multiple of the order squared .",

    "one eigenvalue equal to @xmath75 with eigenvector @xmath76    we now consider a family of graphs for which the cut produced by spectral bisection and the optimal bisection are `` far '' from each other .",
