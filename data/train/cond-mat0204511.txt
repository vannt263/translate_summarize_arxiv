    "with recent advances in oxide epitaxy , coherent growth of nearly perfect ultrathin perovskite films and heterostructures is now possible @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "individual constituent layers are under mixed mechanical boundary conditions : constrained to the substrate lattice constant in - plane , the films are free to relax in the normal direction .",
    "the strains achieved in this way can be quite significant , and can be controlled to tune structure , ferroelectric , and dielectric properties of these nanostructured materials @xcite .",
    "for example , the polarization could be increased over that of known bulk compounds @xcite , improving the performance of ferroelectric field - effect transistors and nonvolatile memories .",
    "when the interfaces in lattice - matched heterostructures are between sufficiently similar materials , even the thinnest layers can be well described by considering the behavior of the bulk under the same boundary conditions .",
    "thus , for example , many properties of batio@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 superlattices can be understood by considering the effects of large strains on bulk batio@xmath0 . this has led to great interest in information about highly strained bulk and film states in the perovskites , for example as presented previously in a phenomenological landau - devonshire framework @xcite .",
    "here we perform first - principles calculations and obtain information about the structure , spontaneous polarization , and zone - center phonons of bulk tetragonal batio@xmath0 with misfit strains down to about -2.3% . while our results correspond to zero temperature",
    ", previous work @xcite suggests that in this high - strain regime , the tetragonal phase is stable with increasing temperature and thus our analysis is relevant to the study of ultrathin batio@xmath0 films and batio@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 superlattices at room temperature @xcite .",
    "to predict the ground state structure of strained batio@xmath0 and compute the associated polarization , we use density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite within the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite , as implemented with a plane - wave basis in the vienna _ ab initio _ simulations package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "results are obtained using projector - augmented wave ( paw ) @xcite potentials provided with vasp .",
    "the paw potentials explicitly treat 10 valence electrons for sr ( @xmath1 ) , 12 for ti ( @xmath2 ) , and 6 for oxygen ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the ions are steadily relaxed toward equilibrium until the hellmann - feynman forces are less than 10@xmath4 ev /  .",
    "brillouin zone integrations are performed with a gaussian broadening of 0.1 ev during all relaxations .",
    "all calculations are performed with a 6@xmath56@xmath56 monkhorst - pack * k*-point mesh and a 50 ry plane - wave cutoff .",
    "once ground - state structures are obtained , polarizations are determined from first principles using the berry - phase formalism @xcite .",
    "the force - constant matrices are then obtained with a frozen - phonon approach .",
    "specifically , a series of calculations is performed in which each ion in turn is displaced along @xmath6 by 0.1% of the lattice parameter and the hellmann - feynman forces on all the atoms computed ; the phonon frequencies and eigenvectors are then acquired through diagonalization of the corresponding dynamical matrix .",
    "we begin by calculating the equilibrium structural parameters of batio@xmath0 under zero stress .",
    "the observed phases of bulk batio@xmath0 are closely related to the cubic perovskite structure @xmath7 @xcite , which is the structure of the high - temperature phase ( t@xmath8403 k ) .",
    "the simple cubic unit cell of this structure can be chosen so the ti cation occupies the body - centered site 1b ( @xmath9,@xmath9,@xmath9 ) and is octahedrally coordinated by oxygen anions at 3c ( @xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath9 ) ; the ba cation is then at wyckoff position 1a ( @xmath10,@xmath10,@xmath10 ) , and twelve - fold coordinated by oxygens .",
    "the rhombohedral @xmath11 phase is computed to be the ground state of batio@xmath0 , consistent with observations @xcite ; however , it is just slightly lower in energy ( only @xmath121 mev per unit cell ) than the optimized tetragonal @xmath13 structure @xcite , the observed room temperature phase @xcite . in the tetragonal phase ,",
    "the simple cubic lattice distorts , resulting in two independent lattice parameters @xmath14 ( in - plane ) and @xmath15 ( normal ) .",
    "the lower symmetry also permits relative displacement of the atomic sublattices along @xmath6 , with wyckoff positions 1a ( @xmath10,@xmath10,@xmath10 ) for ba and 1b ( @xmath9,@xmath9,@xmath9+@xmath16 ) for ti , while two wyckoff positions are occupied by oxygens , designated o@xmath17 , and o@xmath18 : 1b ( @xmath9,@xmath9,@xmath19 ) and 2c ( @xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath9+@xmath20 ) .",
    "these displacements result in a nonzero polarization along [ 001 ] .",
    "the computed values of the structural parameters are given in the first line of table i. our calculated lattice parameters @xmath14=3.945   and @xmath15=3.988   are slightly smaller than those found experimentally ( @xmath14=3.994   and @xmath15=4.036   @xcite ) , the size of the underestimate being typical of that found in lda studies of a wide variety of insulators and semiconductors .",
    "the smaller volume is known , however , to suppress the polar instability @xcite , and indeed the computed displacements ( in reduced units of @xmath15 ) of 0.0122 , -0.0192 , and -0.0124 for @xmath16 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively , are smaller than the measured values @xcite , which are 0.015 , -  0.023 , and -0.014 .",
    "the polarization of the optimized tetragonal phase ( @xmath21=24.97  @xmath22c/@xmath23 ) is thus also significantly less than that computed with the experimental structural parameters ( 32.2  @xmath22c/@xmath23 ) . as a consequence , in the following",
    "we define misfit strains to be relative to the calculated lattice constants , and define polarization enhancement relative to the computed zero - stress polarization @xmath21 .    in coherent epitaxial thin films and [ 001 ] superlattice heterostructures ,",
    "the two lattice vectors in the plane of the interface are constrained to match the substrate while the third lattice vector is free to relax . here",
    ", we consider tetragonal batio@xmath0 ( @xmath13 ) under mechanical boundary conditions corresponding to coherent epitaxy of a @xmath15-axis oriented phase on simple cubic substrates , such as srtio@xmath0 , having lattice constants slightly smaller than that of stress - free bulk tetragonal batio@xmath0 .",
    "we perform a series of constrained relaxations in which the in - plane lattice constant @xmath14 of bulk tetragonal batio@xmath0 is compressed ( e.g. , to the value of a hypothetical substrate ) and the length of the normal axis and atomic positions are optimized .",
    "we consider misfit strains ranging from -0.28% to -2.28% .",
    "the absolute stabilities of the resulting structures require independent investigation .",
    "for example , it may be energetically favorable for the polarization vector and c - axis to tilt toward the [ 110 ] direction ( this has been referred to as the @xmath24 phase in previous work @xcite ) , lowering the point symmetry to monoclinic .",
    "we have , however , verified that for misfit strains of -0.76% and larger , lowering the symmetry to monoclinic does not result in a lower energy , and we can therefore tentatively conclude that the @xmath13 structure is relevant under the boundary conditions considered in this work .",
    "the optimized structural parameters of strained @xmath15-phase batio@xmath0 are summarized in table i. a tendency to conserve volume is manifested as an increase in @xmath15 with increasing magnitude of the misfit strain , through this increase does not result in a full compensation of the in - plane compression and the volume actually decreases moderately .",
    "the atomic displacements relative to the centrosymmetrically - strained cubic perovskite structure exhibit a significant , nearly linear , increase with increasing misfit strain . both the average and deviation ( or splitting ) of the two ti - o@xmath17 distances ( along the @xmath6-oriented ti - o chain ) increase with misfit strain , from 1.994 @xmath25 0.125  at zero misfit to 2.066 @xmath25 0.233  at -2.28% .",
    "thus , the smaller ti - o@xmath17 distance actually decreases slightly , from 1.87 to 1.83  , while the larger distance increases by 8% over the same range .",
    "the shortest ba - o@xmath18 distance also declines modestly from 2.77 to 2.75  .",
    "the shortest ba - o@xmath17 distance , however , decreases more rapidly with increasing strain and , for the largest strain considered ( 2.28% ) , this separation is smaller than the minimum ba - o@xmath18 contact .",
    "these structural trends are accompanied by a significant change in polarization @xmath26 .",
    "specifically , the increased atomic displacements associated with the increase of tetragonality ( @xmath27 ) tend to increase the polarization ; for 2.28% strain , the polarization _",
    "increases _ by nearly a factor of two .",
    "these results are consistent with a previous first - principles study , in which a strong dependence of the polarization on the @xmath15 parameter was observed for batio@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "we also report the increase in energy per unit cell , @xmath28 , which reflects the energy cost of nonzero misfit strain .",
    "it varies quadratically with misfit strain over the range shown , with an estimated effective elastic constant of 135 ev / unit cell .",
    "the computed frequencies for the @xmath6 polarized zone - center phonons for each optimized structure are given in table ii .",
    "as there are five atoms in each primitive cell , 12 zone - center optical phonons are expected ( plus three acoustic modes ) . at the zone center",
    "these are labeled by the irreducible representations of the c@xmath29 point group .",
    "there are 4 a@xmath30 modes ( raman and ir - active ) , 1 b@xmath30 mode ( raman active ) , and 5 doubly - degenerate e modes ( raman and ir - active ) , of which the a@xmath30 and b@xmath30 modes have atomic displacements and polarization ( if nonzero ) only along @xmath6 .",
    "the frequencies of the three a@xmath30 modes are 503 , 252 , and 178  @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "these agree quite well with a room - temperature experiment , which reports 512 , 276 , and 178  @xmath31 for the same to modes @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the corresponding eigenvectors indicates that the two highest - frequency modes involves primarily ti and o motion ; in the lowest the cations move opposite to the anions , with each ion in the primitive cell participating almost equally .",
    "the b@xmath30 mode , for which the computed frequency is 294  @xmath31 , is raman active and involves alternating motion of the two o@xmath18 ions . as for the a@xmath30 modes , our computed frequency agrees well with the value of 308  @xmath31 measured at room temperature @xcite .",
    "we are presently unaware of previous first - principles calculations of zone - center phonon frequencies in tetragonal batio@xmath0 , although we note previous calculations have been performed using an empirical rigid - ion model @xcite and shell - model potentials @xcite .    in the remainder of table",
    "ii , we report the effect of in - plane compression on the frequencies of these four modes .",
    "we find that the two highest a@xmath30 modes _ increase _ with increasing misfit strain , while the frequency of the lowest - lying a@xmath30 mode is nearly independent of misfit strain down to about -2.3% .",
    "in contrast , the computed raman - active b@xmath30 mode frequency is found to _ decrease _ with increasing misfit strain .",
    ".structural parameters of batio@xmath0 under in - plane compression , computed from first principles .",
    "the misfit strain ( % ) is measured relative to the calculated lattice parameter of the computed tetragonal phase , reported in the table as 0.0% strain .",
    "displacements are given relative to the centrosymmetrically - strained cubic - perovskite structure with the ba position fixed at ( 0,0,0 ) in reduced coordinates ( units of @xmath15 ) .",
    "p@xmath32 is the berry - phase polarization in @xmath22c/@xmath23 , with p@xmath33 being the polarization of the equilibrium tetragonal structure .",
    "@xmath28 is the increase in energy in mev per unit cell relative to the equilibrium tetragonal structure .",

    "the trends witnessed here in the computed properties of strained batio@xmath0 are quite general and reflect the underlying physics of ferroelectric perovskites under the mixed - mechanical boundary conditions associated with epitaxy .",
    "in - plane compression resulting from epitaxial stress favors expansion of @xmath15 normal to the substrate and , by a mechanism analogous to that responsible for the enhancement of the ferroelectric instability with increasing volume , the polar distortion and associated polarization along @xmath6 is expected to increase , as observed .",
    "while larger polarization enhancements may in principle be achieved through larger misfit strains , the role of misfit strain in materials design is limited by a rapidly increasing strain energy @xmath28 . above a critical thickness , misfit dislocations will become energetically favorable , and the film or heterostructure will relax to its bulk lattice constant , relieving stress and decreasing the polarization .",
    "however , coherent epitaxy of batio@xmath0-based heterostructures of useful thicknesses has already been demonstrated @xcite , and the present results show that the misfit strain of batio@xmath0 on a srtio@xmath0 substrate ( @xmath122% ) is large enough to achieve significant enhancement of the polarization .",
    "our computed phonon frequencies are of interest chiefly for two reasons .",
    "first , combined with the computed born effective charges and electronic dielectric constant ( to be reported in a separate publication ) , they determine the phonon contribution to the static dielectric response @xmath34 .",
    "while clearly an important property in itself , @xmath35 should also be relevant for understanding the effects of changing electrical boundary conditions on films and superlattices .",
    "second , the sensitivity to strain of the mode frequencies , particularly the intermediate frequency a@xmath30 mode , can provide an experimental probe of the strain state of a batio@xmath0 layer .",
    "indeed , for the closely related material pbtio@xmath0 , mode hardening has been observed in films under compressive epitaxial stress @xcite .    although our focus here centers on the effects of strain , macroscopic electric fields , interfacial effects , and finite size effects must also play a fundamental role in determining the properties of coherent epitaxial thin films and superlattices .",
    "however , knowledge of strain effects has already proved to be invaluable for analyzing experimental and first - principles results @xcite , and for separating out the contributions of other intrinsic as well as extrinsic effects .",
    "therefore , a broader study of batio@xmath0 , which includes calculation of the dielectric tensor and related quantities , is currently in progress .",
    "a similar study of other perovskites , such as pbtio@xmath0 , pbzro@xmath0 , srtio@xmath0 , knbo@xmath0 and ktao@xmath0 , would also be pertinent .",
