    "the recent superkamiokande data @xcite on atmospheric neutrinos provides evidence for neutrino oscillations , thus suggesting that neutrinos have non - vanishing masses .",
    "the simplest way of understanding the smallness of these masses is through the seesaw mechanism @xcite which naturally leads to majorana neutrinos .    in this article",
    "we provide a geometrical interpretation of cp violation with majorana neutrinos . in the quark sector of the three - generation standard model ( sm )",
    "it is well known that cp violation can be described by six unitarity triangles @xcite .",
    "they are obtained from orthogonality of the rows and columns of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix @xmath0 @xcite , and are all equivalent . under a rephasing transformation of the quark fields ,",
    "these unitarity triangles rotate and therefore their orientation has no physical meaning .",
    "however , their area does have physical meaning and in fact all the six triangles have the same area which is proportional to the rephasing invariant cp violating quantity @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask how this geometrical analysis can be extended to the leptonic sector , when majorana neutrinos are present . in this article",
    "we will address to this question , considering first the cases of three and four left - handed majorana neutrinos and then the case of three left - handed and an arbitrary number of right - handed neutrinos .",
    "we will interpretate the well - known features of cp violation for majorana neutrinos in terms of geometrical properties of polygons .",
    "in the sm extension with majorana neutrino masses , the mass terms of the leptonic lagrangian , in the weak eigenstate basis , can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are three - dimensional vectors in flavour space , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are @xmath8 complex matrices and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath7 can be taken as symmetric without loss of generality .",
    "the mass term for the neutrinos can be generated extending the scalar sector with a higgs triplet or can be the result of a seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "the charged current term in this basis is @xmath10 the leptonic mass matrices @xmath6 , @xmath7 are diagonalized through the transformations @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xmath8 unitary matrices , so that @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the diagonal mass matrices .",
    "one can then write , in the mass eigenstate basis , @xmath20 the mixing matrix @xmath21 is the analogous of the ckm matrix in the quark sector , and can be parametrized with 3 mixing angles and 6 phases . the phase of the charged lepton mass eigenstates is arbitrary , and we can use this freedom to eliminate three of these phases",
    ". however , the phase of the neutrino mass eigenstates can not be changed , since this transformation does not leave invariant the neutrino mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ ec:4 ] ) .",
    "hence the mixing matrix @xmath22 has in general three independent , cp violating physical phases instead of one .",
    "two of these phases are `` majorana phases '' that could be removed if rephasing of the neutrino fields was allowed .",
    "the other phase is the analogous to the ckm phase which can not be removed even for dirac neutrinos , a `` dirac phase '' .",
    "the mixing matrix can be parametrized in general as a diagonal matrix of phases multiplied by a @xmath8 unitary matrix in the standard parametrization @xcite @xmath23 in this parametrization , @xmath24 is the dirac phase and @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the majorana phases .",
    "cp is conserved if @xmath27 mod @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 mod @xmath31 ( from now on we will write for simplicity @xmath27 , @xmath32 , @xmath30 ) . note that majorana phases of @xmath33 do not imply cp violation but indicate different cp parities of the neutrino mass eigenstates @xcite .",
    "the only rephasing transformations allowed are @xmath34 under these transformations , the matrix elements of @xmath22 transform as @xmath35 .",
    "hence the minimal rephasing invariant terms are the products @xmath36 , and the minimal cp violating quantities their imaginary parts @xmath37 . are not cp violating if @xmath38 ( see section 4 ) . ]    one can define triangles analogous to those depicted in the quark sector by multiplying two columns of @xmath22 , _ e. g. _ @xmath39 . under rephasing transformations , these triangles rotate in the complex plane , @xmath40 , so their orientation has no physical meaning .",
    "they share a common area @xmath41 .",
    "we will call these triangles `` dirac triangles '' .",
    "the vanishing of their area implies @xmath42 , but does not imply that the minimal cp violating quantities @xmath37 are zero , and cp can still be violated . in terms of phases",
    ", @xmath43 implies that the dirac phase vanishes ( @xmath27 in the parametrization in eq .",
    "( [ ec:5 ] ) ) but the majorana phases can still violate cp . thus these triangles provide a necessary but not sufficient condition for cp conservation and are not enough to completely describe cp violation .",
    "one can also define three `` majorana triangles '' multiplying two rows of @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) : @xmath44    under a change of phase these triangles do not rotate in the complex plane , since all their terms are rephasing invariant .",
    "thus their orientation is physically meaningful .",
    "these majorana triangles provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for cp conservation :    1 .",
    "vanishing of their common area @xmath45 .",
    "[ cond2 ] orientation of all majorana triangles along the direction of the real or imaginary axes .",
    "the first condition implies that the three triangles collapse into lines in the complex plane and the dirac phase vanishes .",
    "condition ( 2 ) implies that the majorana phases do not violate cp .",
    "if the three collapsed triangles are on the @xmath46 axis , one has @xmath47 @xmath48 and cp is obviously conserved .",
    "if one of these triangles , @xmath49 , is parallel to the @xmath50 axis , that means that the mass eigenstates @xmath51 and @xmath52 have opposite cp parities , but there is not cp violation .",
    "multiplying the @xmath53 or the @xmath54 row by @xmath55 we can rotate the triangle to the @xmath46 axis making the mass of the corresponding eigenstate negative .",
    "hence the three majorana triangles provide a complete description of cp violation .",
    "each one of their sides , if not parallel to one of the axes , is itself a signal of cp violation , contrarily to the dirac case where only a nonzero area signals cp violation .",
    "one may wonder whether the three conditions ( [ cond2 ] ) are independent , _",
    "i. e. _ whether the orientation of the three triangles is related . if at least one column of @xmath22 , _ e. g. _ the first column , has nonzero elements , one has @xmath56 this is true independently of the area @xmath57 , but in the case of vanishing areas , eq .",
    "( [ ec:7 ] ) implies that the angles between the triangles and the real axis are related , and only two triangles are needed , for instance @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "requiring that these two triangles are on the @xmath46 or @xmath50 axis eliminates the two majorana phases .    to describe cp violation in the most general cases ,",
    "the three triangles are needed . in order to see that this is the case ,",
    "let us consider the mixing matrix @xmath60 for this particular matrix , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are trivial , and cp is violated unless @xmath61 mod @xmath31 , _ i. e. _",
    "@xmath62 is parallel to one of the axes .",
    "analogous mixing matrices can be written to show that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are necessary in general .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us discuss two interesting special cases . if one neutrino is massless ,",
    "_ e. g. _ @xmath63 , the phase of @xmath64 can be changed leaving @xmath65 invariant .",
    "the orientation of the triangles @xmath58 and @xmath59 has no physical meaning , and all cp violation can be summarized in @xmath62 . in this case",
    "we have only the dirac phase ( @xmath24 ) and one majorana phase ( @xmath26 ) . requiring that the area of @xmath62 is zero eliminates @xmath24 , and requiring that @xmath62 is parallel to the @xmath46 or @xmath50 axis eliminates @xmath26",
    ". the cases @xmath66 and @xmath67 are similar .    in the case that there is one and only one zero in @xmath22 , _",
    "e. g. _ @xmath68 , the three triangles have null area and the dirac phase is zero . the orientation of the three triangles is related and only two of them are necessary to describe cp violation .",
    "if there are two zeroes in the mixing matrix , @xmath22 is analogous to the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ ec:8 ] ) with at most one majorana phase , and only one triangle is nontrivial .",
    "before considering the inclusion of right - handed neutrinos it is convenient to analyze the simpler case of four left - handed neutrinos . the ckm matrix in this case is a @xmath69 matrix , with three dirac phases and three majorana phases .",
    "the unitarity relations between its rows can be represented in the complex plane as six majorana quadrangles .",
    "for example , the orthogonality condition between the first and second rows can be represented as the quadrangle @xmath70 its area is when drawn in the order of eq .",
    "( [ ec:9 ] ) is convex . in other case",
    ", its sides must be reordered , obtaining an expression similar to eq .",
    "( [ ec:10 ] ) .",
    "the results are unchanged . ]",
    "@xmath71 if @xmath72 , the four imaginary products are zero .",
    "the condition for the vanishing of the three dirac phases is that the areas of three independent convex quadrangles ( for instance , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 or @xmath73 , @xmath76 , @xmath74 ) are zero @xcite .",
    "when this condition is fulfilled , the areas of all the quadrangles are zero . to describe cp violation with all generality the six quadrangles @xmath73 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath74 , @xmath78 , @xmath75 are necessary , since there are special cases when all quadrangles but one are trivial .",
    "cp is conserved if , and only if , these six convex quadrangles have null area and are orientated in the direction of one of the axes . however , if at least one column of @xmath22 has all elements non - vanishing , _",
    "e. g. _ the first column , @xmath79 and the three quadrangles @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 completely characterize cp violation .",
    "the case of 3 left - handed and @xmath80 right - handed neutrinos is similar to the extension of the sm with @xmath80 up - type quark singlets , with some differences due to the majorana character of the neutrinos .",
    "the ckm mixing matrix @xmath22 is a @xmath81 submatrix of a @xmath82 unitary matrix , with @xmath83 dirac phases and @xmath84 majorana phases .",
    "in addition , the neutral current lagrangian contains nondiagonal terms , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a @xmath82 hermitian matrix with complex nondiagonal elements .",
    "note that @xmath87 is a linear combination of weak eigenstates @xmath5 , @xmath88 with different isospin .",
    "however , the flavour - changing neutral ( fcn ) couplings do not contain additional cp violating phases . for any number of right - handed neutrinos @xmath80",
    ", the unitarity relations between rows of @xmath22 can be represented as convex majorana quadrangles in the complex plane @xcite .",
    "for example , the orthogonality condition between the first and second rows reads @xmath89 with @xmath90 the fcn coupling between the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath64 and @xmath91 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the geometrical interpretation is then very similar to the previous case .",
    "the condition for the vanishing of the @xmath92 dirac phases is that the area of @xmath93 independent convex quadrangles is zero , for instance @xmath73 , @xmath74  @xmath94 . in this case , the areas of the remaining quadrangles are also zero .",
    "the condition for the vanishing of the @xmath84 majorana phases is that all the @xmath95 quadrangles are parallel to the @xmath46 or @xmath50 axis .",
    "hence , the complete description of cp violation with three left - handed and @xmath80 right - handed neutrinos is achieved with @xmath95 quadrangles .",
    "note that in the limit where the heavy neutrinos decouple , @xmath96 for @xmath97 and the three quadrangles involving only the light neutrinos reduce to the three triangles described in the previous section .",
    "the other quadrangles are trivial .",
    "relevant information on the unitarity polygons ( and the cp violating phases ) can be extracted from cp violating and cp conserving processes .",
    "the cp violating processes may be sensitive to the majorana phases or may not .",
    "we will show examples of each case .",
    "cp violation in neutrino oscillations is not sensitive to majorana phases .",
    "the dirac or majorana character of the neutrinos is not revealed in this kind of experiments , and thus cp violation observables are proportional to imaginary quartets @xmath98 .",
    "neutrino oscillations can only provide information on the areas of the unitarity polygons and the dirac phases .    one important process",
    "to test the majorana character of the neutrinos is neutrinoless double - beta decay .",
    "this process is mediated by the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , where we can observe that the majorana character of the neutrinos is essential .",
    "the cross - section of this process is @xmath99 where the rephasing invariance is explicit .",
    "@xmath100 is a factor independent of the mixing angles .",
    "there are terms proportional to @xmath101 and also terms proportional to the first sides of the triangles ( or quadrangles ) , the sides involving the couplings of the neutrinos to the electron .",
    "the measurement of the neutrinosless double beta decay rate then serves to constrain the cp violating parameters .",
    "the decay of heavy majorana neutrinos has been proposed as a source of cp violation for baryogenesis @xcite . here for definiteness we will consider the cp asymmetry in the decay of a heavy neutrino @xmath102 . the tree - level and one - loop diagrams relevant for the cp asymmetry in this decay",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "note that the majorana character of the neutrinos plays an essential rle in the second diagram .",
    "there are four more one - loop diagrams not taken into account .",
    "two of them involve @xmath103 and photon exchange between the electron and the @xmath104 .",
    "they have the same weak phase as the tree - level diagram and do not contribute to the cp asymmetry at lowest order .",
    "the other two involve @xmath103 exchange between the neutrino and the electron and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "if fcn couplings are neglected , they also have the same weak phase as the tree - level diagram .",
    "the difference @xmath105 is a cp violating observable .",
    "extracting the dependence on the mixing angles it can be written as @xmath106 with @xmath107 form factors independent of mixing angles . to understand this formula we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] that the mixing angle factors of the tree - level and one - loop contributions , @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively , transform in the same way under rephasing of the charged lepton fields ( as they must ) , but not under rephasing of the neutrino mass eigenstates ( as they should in the case of dirac neutrinos ) .",
    "if the two mixing angle factors transformed in the same way under rephasing of the neutrino mass eigenstates , we would have a dependence @xmath110 or similar , and the asymmetry would not be sensitive to the majorana phases .",
    "the diagrams involving @xmath103 exchange between the neutrino and @xmath111 , @xmath104 give an additional contribution of this type .    the cp asymmetry in eq .",
    "( [ ec:14 ] ) is written as a linear combination of imaginary parts of products of the sides @xmath112 of the quadrangle @xmath113 , summing over @xmath54 and @xmath114 .",
    "the terms with @xmath115 contain @xmath116 .",
    "we see that a side of @xmath113 does not contribute to the cp asymmetry if it is parallel to one of the axes , although it may contribute in the terms of mixing with other sides if the dirac phases are nonzero , _ i. e. _ if other sides of the same quadrangle are cp violating .",
    "finally we will show the relation between the unitarity triangles and the weak - basis invariants .",
    "the lowest order weak - basis invariant for three left - handed majorana neutrinos is @xcite @xmath117 with @xmath118 the mass of the charged lepton @xmath53 .",
    "( [ ec:16 ] ) rephasing invariance is explicit .",
    "the invariant is written as a sum of imaginary parts of products of two sides @xmath119 of the same triangle @xmath49 weighted by mass factors .",
    "the terms with @xmath120 are proportional to @xmath121 .",
    "we see that a side of @xmath49 parallel to the real or imaginary axis does not contribute to @xmath122 .",
    "if the dirac phase is also zero , the whole contribution of @xmath49 is zero .",
