    "recently , significant progress has been made in understanding the creation of a baryon number asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the electroweak phase transition @xcite,@xcite is one particularly attractive possibility for the generation of this asymmetry .",
    "indeed the standard model contains all the necessary ingredients @xcite , i.e. baryon number violating interactions , c and cp violation and a first order phase transition , that provides departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "unfortunately , problems arise when one tries to quantitatively reproduce the observed baryon number asymmetry , using the mechanism of @xcite,@xcite in the framework of the standard model with the experimentally allowed higgs mass range :    * a baryon asymmetry created during the electroweak phase transition is washed out in the true vacuum phase @xcite , * the phase transition is not strongly first order @xcite,@xcite * the cp violation due to the ckm matrix is small .",
    "it is under controversial debate whether this suffices for baryon asymmetry generation @xcite or not @xcite    thus one has to face the situation that the standard model with one higgs might not be sufficient .",
    "more complicated higgs sectors , in particular models with two higgs doublets have been suggested as a possible way out . in the case of two - doublet models",
    "additional cp violation in the higgs sector can be introduced and the enlarged number of free parameters will help to solve the other problems .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on models having a two stage phase transition as proposed in . at some critical temperature",
    "the universe would have first evolved towards some metastable intermediate higgs phase , followed by a first order phase transition towards the present higgs configuration at some lower temperature . in this way",
    "one can easily avoid a baryon wash - out in this last phase , just due to the lowering of the transition temperature .",
    "the mass of the usual higgs meson ( responsible for spontaneous symmetry breaking ) can be as high as a few hundred gev , well above the current experimental limit .",
    "the second higgs doublet can also be quite massive ( again up to the order of 200 gev ) and would not have been observed yet .",
    "the crucial problem for this model will be whether baryon number violating processes in the intermediate phase are fast enough to support baryon number generation .    in chapter 2 we introduce the model and discuss the appropriate parameter region fora two - stage transition . in chapter 3 , b+l violation in the final phase is studied .",
    "chapter 4 contains the discussion of sphaleron transitions in the intermediate phase .",
    "finally we present our conclusions .",
    "we will parametrize the potential of the two doublet model in a slightly unconventional form following    @xmath0    this version of the two higgs potential can be easily transformed into the representation usually adopted ( e.g. , @xcite ) but is more convenient for our purpose .",
    "we only couple the @xmath1 doublet to the quarks to give them a mass .",
    "this arrangement avoids tree level flavour changing neutral currents .",
    "@xmath2 is real and the corresponding term has a structure which differs from the one in .",
    "this is not essential , however , since we ( as well as carlson and land in ref . )",
    "consider the limiting case @xmath3 .",
    "the cp violation in both cases is expressed by @xmath4 and @xmath2 .    as usual",
    ", we express @xmath5 in terms of real fields with the proper normalization of the kinetic term    @xmath6    as in we adjust the phases of the higgs doublets such that the only fields getting a vacuum expectation value are @xmath7 .",
    "to find the temperature dependent contribution to the potential we proceed in a standard way @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we only take into account lowest order effects and since only the top quark has an appreciable yukawa coupling @xmath8 we ignore the effects of the other quarks and derive the temperature dependent part of the effective potential as    @xmath9    where    @xmath10    @xmath8 is related to the top quark mass by @xmath11 . for our calculations we use a top mass @xmath12 gev .",
    "the w - boson and top quark part of the @xmath13 s is calculated using the standard procedure @xmath14    these values differ from those given in reference by factors of @xmath15 , and therefore numerical results are substantially different from those of reference .    for simplicity , we restrict our analysis from now on to two - higgs theories without explicit cp violation in the higgs sector , i.e. we set @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the dynamics of the phase transition will not be affected substantially by small non - vanishing couplings of this kind .",
    "this also implies that the vev s of @xmath18 can be taken to be real , i.e. @xmath19 vanishes .    in this particular range of parameters the high temperature effective potential",
    "is found to be    @xmath20    using this potential we get for the temperature dependent vev s @xmath21 and @xmath22 . from the second derivative of the potential we read off the zero temperature higgs masses as @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the critical temperatures @xmath25 are defined as those where the symmetric ( i.e. @xmath26 ) minimum becomes unstable into the @xmath27 respectively @xmath28 direction .",
    "@xmath29    in order to have a two stage phase transition",
    "as proposed in we require @xmath30 , such that the first stage of the transition leads to a minimum located at @xmath31 .",
    "then at @xmath32 the second minimum evolves which lies in the @xmath33 direction .",
    "as the temperature decreases the depths of the two minima become equal .",
    "this defines another temperature below which the minimum in the @xmath34 direction is lower than the minimum in @xmath35 direction , and critical bubbles may occur .",
    "this critical temperature is given by    @xmath36    a further extremum is located at    @xmath37    where @xmath38 .",
    "this is a saddle point separating the two minima . for certain combinations of the coupling constants",
    "we find that the saddle point moves closer to the @xmath39 minimum as the temperature is falling below @xmath40 and merges with it at the roll - over temperature @xmath41 . now",
    "the minimum in @xmath39 direction is not even classically stable .",
    "the roll over temperature is    @xmath42    the actual transition will take place in the temperature intervall between the tunneling and the roll - over temperature . in order to decide whether the transition is completed before roll - over takes place , we have to study the critical bubble solutions to get the free energy .",
    "the existence of a roll - over temperature is not necessary for a phase transition to occur . in some parameter range , tunneling and bubble formation",
    "occur close to the critical temperature although the second minimum is preserved for all temperatures .",
    "we require the following hierarchy for the above defined temperatures in order to have the desired two stage phase transition :    @xmath43    the existence of @xmath44 ensures that @xmath45 holds below @xmath40 , i.e. the @xmath28 minimum is the true one .",
    "furthermore , we find that the conditions @xmath46 and @xmath47 happen to lead to the same restrictions on the free parameters of the theory , i.e. @xmath48 , the two higgs masses , and @xmath49 .",
    "thus we get an upper and a lower bound for @xmath50 as a function of the other three parameters .",
    "the upper bound corresponds to @xmath51 , the lower one to @xmath52 .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath53 is sharpened by taking into account the wash - out behaviour .",
    "we require sufficient suppression of baryon number violating sphaleron transitions in the broken phase in order to maintain the baryon asymmetry assumed to be generated during the second stage of the phase transition , or before .",
    "this defines the wash - out temperature @xmath54 according to the followingline of arguments .",
    "we define the three - dimensional effective coupling @xmath55 , which is the relevant temperature dependent expansion parameter for the effective potential , as    @xmath56    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite the sphaleron rate in two - higgs models with positive couplings only , can fairly accurately be estimated by an effective coupling and the coresponding one - higgs sphaleron rate . in the case of a two stage phase transition",
    "we have two kinds of sphalerons , one when the @xmath27 minimum is the absolute minimum ( at @xmath57 ) and the other , when the @xmath28 minimum plays this role ( at @xmath58 ) .",
    "taking the boundary conditions for the higgs fields of the sphaleron configuration and the positive definiteness of @xmath59 into account , we find that there is a sphaleron minimum of the true vacuum only involving the @xmath28 field , whereas in the intermediate phase only the @xmath27 field is responsible .",
    "thus , as long as we neglect cp violation , the condition for a baryon number freeze - out inside the true vacuum bubble reads    @xmath60    where the function @xmath61 is of the order of 3.5 , somewhat depending on @xmath62 but only sligthly varying with t ( see fig.2 of ref . ) .",
    "the number @xmath63 arises from the comparison with the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "the above relation allows us to define the wash - out temperature , below which the wash - out constraint is fullfilled :    @xmath64    we define the nucleation temperature @xmath65 as the temperature where the probability of finding a critical bubble in the causal horizon of the universe is equal to one .",
    "this temperature defines the start of the phase transition with bubble expansion .",
    "we find @xmath65 ( see @xcite ) by calculating the bubble solution and the corresponding free energy numerically .",
    "since we are dealing with a two point boundary value problem in two dimensions the numerical treatment turns out to be rather involved .",
    "our numerical method consists of two steps . in the first step",
    "we calculate an approximate bounce configuration .",
    "we use an adapted shooting method and do the necessary integrations of the equations of motion with the help of the boerlisch - stoer method .",
    "then , we fit the approximate bounce solution to the asymptotic behaviour of the fields .    in the second step we use a discrete set of points to describe the solution given by the first step . for this set of points",
    "we minimize the sum of the absolute value of the error of the equations of motion in each point by using multidimensional minimisation techniques .",
    "the discussion of the numerical methods and the calculations of general bounce solutions will be subject to a subsequent publication .",
    "the nucleation temperature @xmath65 must be below @xmath54 .",
    "for an optimal model it should be close to @xmath54 since otherwise baryon number violation in the intermediate phase is more strongly suppressed as well , and a smaller baryon asymmetry is generated .",
    "one can also define a temperature @xmath66 where the phase transition is completed , and all space is converted to the true vacuum .",
    "@xmath66 is usually very close to @xmath65 .    in order to clarify the meaning of all these temperatures we discuss one example .",
    "we consider the higgs masses @xmath67 gev and @xmath68 gev , and choose @xmath69 .",
    "the various critical temperatures are presented in figure 1 as function of @xmath53 for a fixed @xmath70 .",
    "( 14,8.3 ) ( 4.3,6.2)@xmath71 ( 3,4.5)@xmath72 ( 3,3.4)@xmath54 ( 3.5,2)@xmath40 ( 7.5,2)@xmath65 ( 9.6,2)@xmath73 ( 1.5,0.2 ) ( 7,0.2)@xmath50 ( 4.1,7.3)@xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 [ gev ] ( 1,3.4 )    @xmath77 do not depend on @xmath50 .",
    "the point where the three critical temperatures intersect gives one upper bound on @xmath53 , shown in fig.2 as the upper curve .",
    "the point where the wash - out temperature and the nucleation temperature @xmath65 meet , gives the true upper bound on @xmath53 if we require baryon number violating processes being out of equilibrium in the low - temperature phase .    at the crossing of @xmath54 and @xmath65 , the two temperatures @xmath66 and @xmath78 are still very close together .",
    "therefore , for practical purposes , @xmath78 can be used to set the upper bound on @xmath53 .",
    "in fig.2 we display the accessible parameter space for a given set of higgs masses taking into account the above limits for given @xmath79 .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath53 ( fig .",
    "2 ) has been obtained from requiring @xmath80 , i.e. the minimum in @xmath28-direction being the true vacuum .",
    "a stricter lower bound follows from @xmath81 ( i.e. the phase transition should actually have taken place ) .",
    "since we want to maximize baryon number violation in the intermediate phase the relevant @xmath53 range is close to the upper bound .",
    "the stronger upper bound comes from the wash - out condition .",
    "it is remarkable that the three curves intersect in two points ( the other located at @xmath82 , @xmath83 outside the range of fig.2 ) that give a lower and upper limit for the coupling constants @xmath49 .",

    "@xcite ) . for the standard model , extended by a second higgs doublet ,",
    "such an analysis is not available .",
    "the couplings @xmath89 should not exceed some number of order one , however .",
    "therefore , only the lower - left corner of fig.2 is relevant .",
    "this still leaves open a large region in the @xmath90 plane , however .",
    "restrictions on the masses arise from triviality bounds on @xmath70 , not @xmath50 .",

    "solutions with the correct hierarchy pattern exist as long as @xmath93 does not exceed the triviality bound @xmath94 . in fig.3",

    "if we now insist on generating the baryon asymmetry during the phase transition ( see , e.g. , the scenarios proposed by @xcite,@xcite or , @xcite ) , we need strong b violation in the false vacuum phase , in order to wash out any accumulated anti - baryon number in front of , or perhaps inside the bubble wall .",
    "this is a requirement in conflict with avoiding the baryon wash - out in the final phase . lowering the transition temperature",
    "will also reduce the sphaleron rate in the metastable intermediate phase .",
    "the generated baryon asymmetry will be proportional to this rate , however , quite independently from details of the mechanism .",
    "the sphaleron rate in the intermediate phase is difficult to estimate because we have to handle strong coupling problems both regarding @xmath53 , and the effective gauge coupling @xmath99 .",
    "actually , increasing the sphaleron rate immediately implies reducing @xmath100 , and thereby increasing the effective gauge coupling .",
    "nevertheless , the higgs field still provides an infrared cut - off , and therefore the situation is better under control than for the high temperature phase with unbroken symmetry .",
    "non - perturbative methods for estimating sphaleron rates at stronger coupling are being developed @xcite but no results for realistic theories are available yet .",
    "therefore , we will simply assume that the quasiclassical expression for the sphaleron rate would still be applicable in the domain of stronger coupling @xmath101 where we follow the notation of @xcite , .",
    "we compare the wash - out rate of the intermediate phase and the true vacuum phase to find out where the strongest wash - out in the intermediate phase can be achieved .",

    "we find that the minimal ratio @xmath107 solely depends on @xmath108 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the only expressions involving @xmath109 are @xmath110 and @xmath54 .",
    "but since their quotient is independent of @xmath109 , the ratio itself is independent of the second higgs mass . in figure",
    "@xmath111 we show the dependence of the calculated ratio on @xmath108 for various triviality bounds on @xmath50 .    in this case",
    "@xmath50 hits the triviality bound before @xmath70 ( compare figure 2 ) .",
    "we find the best wash - out behaviour in the intermediate phase for small @xmath108 .    in order to decide whether this wash - out rate is strong enough , @xmath112 of eq.([unser ] ) , applied to the intermediate phase , should be compared with the expression adopted on dimensional grounds for the symmetric phase .",
    "@xmath113    where @xmath114 is a dimensionless constant asumed to be of order @xmath115 .",

    "( [ unser ] ) to the rate eq.([1higgs ] ) .",
    "the ratio of @xmath116 shows how close we can get with our models to the required wash - out rate @xmath117 .",
    "it is shown in figure 5 that at smaller higgs masses close to the experimental limit we loose about @xmath118 orders of magnitude in the baryon asymmetry compared to estimates starting from the symmetric phase . at larger",

    "the viability of the class of two - higgs models considered for explaining the baryon asymmetry of the universe through the electroweak phase transition depends crucially on the sphaleron rate in the intermediate phase .",
    "if this rate is much smaller than the assumed rate of b+l violation in the high temperature symmetric phase , no significant baryon asymmetry can be generated .",
    "the problem of washing - out a baryon asymmetry in the final higgs phase can be easily avoided , however , without introducing upper bounds on the higgs mass conflicting with experimental lower bounds .    estimating the sphaleron rate in the intermediate phase is a non - perturbative strong coupling problem , and therefore no reliable results are available .",
    "it does not seem plausible , however , that this rate could be high enough for baryon number generation .",
