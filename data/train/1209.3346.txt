    "more than 30 years ago , @xcite published his scaling relations for molecular clouds ( mcs ) : the column density - size relation ( or `` larson s third relation '' )    @xmath7    and the velocity dispersion - size relation    @xmath8    the exponents reported in that work were @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "however , the more widely accepted values are @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; and these have been usually thought to be observational evidence that clouds are in virial equilibrium , although it is important to recall that any pair @xmath13 satisfying @xmath14 will be consistent with virial equilibrium ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "larson s relations have been used in many papers to describe the internal structure of clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* to cite just one of the more recent examples ) .",
    "however , their validity has been called into question for observational reasons @xcite .",
    "specifically , clouds should have a minimum column density to be detected ; and if the column density where too large , clouds will become optically thick ( in co ) , and then such dense regions would not be easily detected .",
    "the net result of these effects would be that observed co clouds should exhibit a small dynamic range in column density , independent of their intrinsic structure .",
    "in a recent study , @xcite used near - infrared extinction measurements to increase the dynamic range of inferred mass column densities .",
    "they studied a sample of local mcs with substantially different physical properties , from giant mcs hosting massive star formation , and masses of the order of 2@xmath15 ( e.g. , orion ) , down to clouds with less star formation activity , and masses of the order of several thousand  ( the pipe nebula ) .",
    "their main results are :    * for an ensemble of mcs observed at a given extinction threshold @xmath16 , the mass varies with size as @xmath1 , implying that the column density @xmath17 is constant and depends on that threshold . * the numerical value of the column density changes with the value of the threshold @xmath16 . *",
    "when analyzing a single mc at different thresholds @xmath16 , the mass - size relation varies as a power - law , with a somewhat shallower power law index ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "@xcite argue that their results can be understood as a consequence of the fact that clouds exhibit a column density probability distribution function ( ) with a lognormal functional form , although in a recent paper , @xcite revisit the @xcite analysis , and suggest ( without demonstration ) that other forms than a lognormal  can produce the same result .",
    "they also argue that the only requirement to satisfy larson s third relation is that the mean  is uncorrelated with region - to - region dispersion in area .    in the present work",
    "we discuss why mcs with very different properties appear to have very similar column densities at a given threshold . in  [ sec : toy ] we draw  diagrams to show that the main features found by @xcite are found for very different functional forms , and that the scatter in column density at any threshold is smaller than a factor of 3 . in  [ sec : thresholding ] we show , furthermore , that when thresholding the volume density , what appears to be constant is the volume density , suggesting that the relation is a consequence of the procedure adopted .",
    "we argue that the only special feature of the structure of local mcs is that they peak at a particular value of the mean , in agreement with @xcite . in  [ sec : intracloud ] , we analyze the case of the mass - size relation for a single cloud , showing that rather than a power - law , the relation is a curve that has slope approaching to 2 at small radii , and flattens for larger radius . as a consequence",
    ", there is some interval in which the slope is close to 1.6 - 1.7 , as reported in observations .",
    "the properties of this relation are determined directly by the shape of the . in  [ sec : discussion ] we further identify the physical reasons for having a typical : first , there is a minimum column density for co shielding ; and second , above this threshold the amount of mass decreases rapidly with increasing column density , which is probably the result of gravitational contraction and collapse .",
    "in our analysis we follow the formalism outlined by @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath19 to denote the extinction in the @xmath20 band unless otherwise specified .",
    "we also recall that @xmath21 , and that the  published by @xcite have a peak at @xmath22  0.1 , equivalent to @xmath23 or @xmath24  cm2 .",
    "now , given a probability distribution function of the extinction @xmath25 , the area and mass above some extinction threshold @xmath16 are defined as :    @xmath26    and    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the mean molecular weight within the mc , @xmath29 is the mass of the hydrogen atom , and @xmath30 is the ratio between the total hydrogen column density and the dust extinction coefficient .",

    "( [ eq : masa ] ) divided by eq .",
    "( [ eq : surface ] ) , is nearly constant for low thresholds @xmath16 , and varies approximately linearly for large thresholds , i.e. ,    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the extinction value at which the  peaks .",
    "since this behavior reproduces qualitatively that of the 12 mcs in the solar neighborhood they analyzed , these authors suggest that the observed constancy of the column density for different clouds is due to their intrinsic internal structure , given by a lognormal",
    ". however , many of the mcs in the solar neighborhood do not exhibit a lognormal  at large column densities but rather frequently exhibit power - law or more complicated shapes @xcite .",
    "thus , the behavior of @xmath33 described above can not be consequence of a universal distribution function of the column density of the mcs .    in order to understand the origin of larson s third relation for multiple clouds , we analyze the following examples . for clarity s sake",

    "furthermore , we showed that if one could in principle threshold the volume density , one would get a @xmath183  volume relation .",
    "this strongly suggests that these types of relations , rather than universal laws , are mostly an artifact of the thresholding process .",
    "operationally , cloud masses are obtained by integrating or summing column densities over the cloud area .",
    "it is thus not surprising that cloud masses are observed to correlate with areas , specially , if most of the mass is at low densities , i.e. , occupying most of the area .",
    "if then the  is rapidly decreasing with increasing column density , this means that most of the column density and thus most of the mass is near the threshold .",
    "thus one automatically gets a cloud mass linearly proportional to its area . similarly , if one were able to measure densities directly , the same principle results in mass linearly proportional to volume .",
    "the significance of the mass - area relationship then reduces to understanding why the mean or peak of the  seems not to vary much from region to region @xcite , and why the  has a rapid decrease with increasing column density in the thresholds of interest .",

    "* ) , since as it would not be a co cloud and these studies are focused towards mcs .    secondly , we argue that most of the mass of clouds is at low density , because the shielding value is roughly the column density at which one expects self - gravity to become important @xcite . numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that the slope of the  at large column densities @xmath2 is steeper than @xmath187 , as a result of gravitational collapse . more specifically , in non - spherical , non - uniform geometries gravitational collapse can be highly non - linear as a function of position @xcite , such that the dense material is a small fraction of the total cloud mass .",
    "@xcite concluded that the `` universality '' of larson s third relation is a result of having the dispersion in the mean value of the column density be smaller than the dispersion in cloud areas .",
    "our argument is that this occurs because the large column density regions of clouds have a small filling factor as a consequence of the gravitational contraction and collapse , producing the mass @xmath188  area result .",
    "we agree with @xcite that therefore the  itself is much more instructive about cloud structure than the mass - area `` law '' , and that the power - law or other high - column density `` tails '' on s is a result of gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our previous arguments that modern versions of larson s second relation @xcite imply global ( and local ) gravitational collapse @xcite , not virial equilibrium .",

    ". the typical values of the exponent used to be smaller , typically @xmath190 @xcite , although it should be recognized that the diagrams presented by @xcite show that the relation is a curved line , rather than a power - law .",

    "we show that for a set of clouds , this relation is an artifact of thresholding the surface density , as long as the form of  peaks near or below the threshold used , and that the mass is a steeply decreasing function of increasing column density .",
    "we argue that the physical reasons for these features of the column density distribution are that there is a minimum column density to shield co , and that this minimum value is not far from that at which the molecular gas becomes jeans unstable , resulting in cloud collapse to form stars .",
