    "understanding the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is the central goal of particle physics today .",
    "a full understanding of ewsb will include a solution to the hierarchy or naturalness problem  that is , why the weak scale is so much lower than the planck scale .",
    "whatever is responsible for ewsb and its hierarchy , it must manifest experimentally at or below the tev energy scale .",
    "our first glimpse at the ewsb scale came from the electroweak precision data from the cern lep collider , which is sensitive to the higgs boson mass in the standard model ( sm ) via radiative corrections .",
    "this electroweak precision data points to the existence of a light higgs boson in the sm , with mass below roughly 200 gev @xcite .",
    "the tev scale is currently being probed at the fermilab tevatron and will soon be thoroughly explored at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . further into the future ,",
    "a linear @xmath3 collider will offer an excellent opportunity to study the dynamics of the new physics with uniquely high precision .",
    "the wealth of data on tev scale physics promised by this experimental program has driven model - building on the theoretical side .    a wide variety of models",
    "have been introduced over the past three decades to address ewsb and the hierarchy problem : supersymmetry , extra dimensions , strong dynamics leading to a composite higgs boson , and the recent `` little higgs '' models @xcite in which the higgs is a pseudo - goldstone boson . in this paper",
    "we consider the last possibility . for concreteness",
    ", we choose a particular model framework , the `` littlest higgs '' @xcite , for our calculations .    in the little higgs models , the sm higgs doublet appears as a pseudo - goldstone boson of an approximate global symmetry that is spontaneously broken at the tev scale .",
    "the models are constructed as nonlinear sigma models , which become strongly coupled ( and thus break down ) no more than one loop factor above the spontaneous symmetry breaking scale .",
    "in fact , in many models unitarity violation in longitudinal gauge boson scattering appears to occur only a factor of a few above the spontaneous symmetry breaking scale , due to the large multiplicity of goldstone bosons @xcite .",
    "thus the little higgs models require an ultraviolet ( uv ) completion at roughly the 10 tev scale .",
    "the first uv completions of little higgs models have been constructed in refs .  @xcite .",
    "the explicit breaking of the global symmetry , by gauge , yukawa and scalar interactions , gives the higgs a mass and non - derivative interactions , as required of the sm higgs doublet .",
    "the little higgs models are constructed in such a way that no _ single _ interaction breaks _ all _ of the symmetry forbidding a mass term for the sm higgs doublet .",
    "this guarantees the cancellation of the one - loop quadratically divergent radiative corrections to the higgs boson mass .",
    "quadratic sensitivity of the higgs mass to the cutoff scale then arises only at the _",
    "two_-loop level , so that a higgs mass at the 100 gev scale , two loop factors below the 10 tev cutoff , is natural .",
    "a light higgs boson is the central feature of the little higgs models . in the littlest higgs model ,",
    "the couplings of the higgs boson to sm particles receive corrections due to the new tev - scale particles @xcite .",
    "these corrections are suppressed by the square of the ratio of the electroweak scale to the tev scale , and are thus parametrically at the level of a few percent .",
    "percent - level measurements of higgs couplings are expected to be possible at a future linear @xmath3 collider and its photon collider extension .",
    "corrections to the higgs couplings can also be induced by the uv completion at 10 tev .",
    "for example , the loop - induced higgs coupling to photon pairs receives corrections from new heavy particles running in the loop .",
    "if the uv completion is weakly coupled , these corrections should naively be suppressed by the square of the ratio of the electroweak scale to the 10 tev scale , and thus be too small to detect with the expected experimental capabilities . however",
    ", if the uv completion is strongly coupled , the strong - coupling enhancement counteracts the suppression from the high mass scale , leading to corrections naively of the same order as those from the tev scale physics . to reiterate ,",
    "if the uv completion is weakly coupled , we expect the corrections to the higgs couplings to be accurately predicted by the tev - scale theory alone .",
    "however , if the uv completion is strongly coupled , we expect the higgs couplings to receive corrections from the uv completion at the same level as the corrections from the tev - scale theory .",
    "the parameters of the littlest higgs model can be measured at the lhc and then used to calculate predictions for the corrections to the higgs couplings due to the tev - scale physics . comparing these predictions to high - precision higgs coupling measurements will serve as a test of the model , as well as a probe for a strongly - coupled uv completion . in this paper , we focus on the process @xmath0 , the rate for which will be measured with high precision at a future photon collider .",

    "the requirement on the @xmath17 mass measurement for the extraction of @xmath12 is much more stringent .",

    "for a heavier @xmath24 , the precision @xmath29 required to give @xmath13 is greater than one ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mzh ] ) .",
    "in addition to the parametric uncertainties in the calculation of the rate for @xmath2 , we must consider other sources of uncertainty . in this section",
    "we discuss potential theoretical and experimental uncertainties in the littlest higgs model parameter extraction , issues in the extraction of @xmath30 from photon collider measurements , and the sources of uncertainty in the sm higgs coupling calculation .",
    "we have computed the correction to the higgs partial widths working to leading nontrivial order in the expansion of the littlest higgs nonlinear sigma model in powers of @xmath31 .",
    "higher - order corrections to the higgs partial widths from the @xmath31 expansion are unlikely to be relevant .",
    "higher - order corrections to the parameter translations ( e.g. , @xmath32 ) and parameter extractions from lhc data , however , could be important .",
    "their effects on the parameter extraction will be at the few - percent level , which is relevant in particular for the @xmath17 mass in the extraction of @xmath12 at low @xmath12 values .",
    "these higher - order terms in the expansion are straightforward to include .",
    "qcd corrections to the cross section for @xmath17 production at the lhc must be taken into account in the determination of the @xmath12 scale .",
    "these can be taken over directly from the sm computations for @xmath33-mediated drell - yan .",
    "the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to drell - yan were computed some 25 years ago @xcite and yield @xmath34-factors of order 1.4 . with the computation of the inclusive nnlo @xmath34-factor more than ten years ago @xcite and the recent computation of the differential nnlo cross section within the past year @xcite , the qcd uncertainty in the @xmath17 cross section is well under control .",
    "similarly , the ( relatively small ) qcd corrections to the @xmath17 branching fraction to dileptons can be taken over from the corresponding calculation for @xmath35 decays .",
    "in addition , the lhc luminosity uncertainty will contribute to the uncertainty in the @xmath17 cross section .",
    "however , a quick examination of table  [ tab : fscale - points ] reveals that even a @xmath36 ( statistical ) uncertainty on the @xmath17 production cross section times leptonic branching ratio does not contribute significantly to the uncertainty in @xmath12 , so that these systematic uncertainties are not a problem .",
    "more important for the determination of @xmath12 are the corrections to , and measurement uncertainties of , the @xmath17 boson mass . for @xmath37 tev , a measurement of @xmath14 at the @xmath38 level is desirable . at this level of precision ,",
    "electroweak radiative corrections to the @xmath17 mass could be important . to be more precise",
    ", the parameter translations between lhc measurements , littlest higgs model parameters , and the @xmath2 rate may need to be treated at next - to - leading order in the electroweak couplings .",
    "this could also be important for the parameter @xmath39 at low @xmath37 tev , which we have proposed to extract from the @xmath40 boson mass measurement .",
    "radiative corrections to the @xmath40 mass within the littlest higgs model could be important for this extraction ; in particular , because the model contains a scalar triplet that gets a nonzero vev , violating custodial symmetry at the tree level , the renormalization of the electroweak sector at the one - loop level requires one additional input ( to fix the triplet vev counterterm ) beyond the usual three sm inputs @xcite .",
    "this extra input parameter can have important effects on the parameter dependence of the one - loop corrections to the sm observables @xcite . the first one - loop calculation in the littlest higgs model involving renormalization of the electroweak sector",
    "was done in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are also experimental issues in the measurement of the @xmath17 mass to high precision , which have been discussed , e.g. , in ref .",
    "the measurement of the mass of a new heavy ( tev - scale ) gauge boson at the lhc relies on accurate measurements of the energy / momentum of very high - energy electrons or muons . for the @xmath17 masses considered ( @xmath41 tev )",
    ", these leptons will have energies of 1 tev or higher . for electrons ,",
    "the energy measurement will come primarily from the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "uncertainties come from both the energy resolution and the energy scale calibration .",
    "a calibration of the lepton energy scale at tev - scale energies could be made , e.g. , using very high-@xmath42 @xmath35 bosons decaying to dielectrons . for muons ,",
    "the momentum is measured from track curvature . while the calibration is under control here ,",
    "the energy resolution per event is worse because the tracks are very stiff , so higher statistics may be needed .",
    "since many models of tev - scale new physics contain high - mass resonances that decay to dileptons , we feel that a more detailed study of the systematic uncertainties affecting the @xmath43 mass measurement would be worthwhile .",
    "photon collider studies @xcite claim a 2% measurement of the @xmath2 rate , which we interpret as a measurement of @xmath30 .",
    "we mention here some sources of uncertainty that must be under control before such a high precision measurement is claimed .",
    "first , the @xmath44 luminosity and polarization spectra must be measured to normalize the higgs production rate .",
    "the photon and electron luminosity and polarization spectra are currently simulated using the programs cain @xcite and guinea - pig @xcite .",
    "the luminosity spectrum can be measured using the reactions @xmath45 @xcite and perhaps @xmath46 .",
    "the photon polarization spectrum could be measured using @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "further study is needed .",
    "second , a photon collider collides more than just photons .",
    "the photon has a parton distribution function containing quarks , gluons , etc . , and collisions of such `` resolved '' photons",
    "can yield higgs production via , e.g. , gluon fusion or @xmath49 fusion .",
    "this resolved - photon part of the higgs production cross section is not proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "the resolved photon contribution to sm higgs production has been studied in ref .",

    "@xcite and found to be small if the photon collider beam energy is optimized for higgs production . ] similarly , the remnant electron beams can contribute to higgs production via @xmath9 fusion , @xmath52 .",
    "these contributions to higgs production are likely to be small , but a quantitative estimate would be useful .    finally , the background to @xmath2 consists mostly of @xmath53 production , with some @xmath54 contribution from charm quarks mistagged as bottom .",
    "the signal is peaked at the higgs mass on top of a background steeply falling with increasing two - jet invariant mass ( due to the photon beam energy spectrum )",
    ". the background can be simulated based on the beam spectra @xcite and the qcd - corrected cross sections for heavy quark pair production in @xmath44 collisions @xcite .",
    "the background normalization must be under control to subtract from the signal .      in order to predict the rate for @xmath2 at the 1% level in the littlest higgs model , the sm rate",
    "must be known at the same level of precision .",
    "we outline here the known radiative corrections and sources of uncertainty in the sm prediction .",
    "the sm @xmath55 decay partial width receives qcd corrections , which of course only affect the top - quark diagrams .",
    "because the external particles in the @xmath56 vertex are color neutral , the virtual qcd corrections are finite by themselves .",
    "since no real radiation diagrams contribute , the qcd corrections to @xmath55 are equivalent to those to the inverse process @xmath57 .",
    "this is in contrast to , e.g. , the qcd corrections to the @xmath58 vertex .",
    "the qcd corrections to @xmath50 in the sm are known analytically at the two - loop [ @xmath59 order @xcite and as a power expansion up to third order in @xmath60 at three - loop [ @xmath61 order @xcite .",
    "they are small for higgs masses @xmath62 ; the @xmath63 corrections are only of order 2% for @xmath64 , and the @xmath65 corrections are negligible , demonstrating that the qcd corrections are well under control .",
    "the sm @xmath55 decay partial width also receives electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "the the electroweak corrections are much more difficult to compute than the qcd corrections and a full two - loop calculation does not yet exist . the electroweak correction due to two - loop diagrams containing light fermion loops and @xmath40 or @xmath35 bosons ( with the higgs boson coupled to the @xmath40 or @xmath35 boson , because the light fermion yukawa couplings are neglected ) was computed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite and contributes between @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 gev .",
    "the leading @xmath69 electroweak correction due to top - mass - enhanced two - loop diagrams containing third - generation quarks was also computed recently in ref .",

    "@xcite , whose results disagree with that of ref .",

    "the expansion appears to be under good control for @xmath68 gev , where this correction contributes about @xmath71 almost independent of @xmath72 .",
    "correction was computed in ref .",
    "@xcite for large @xmath72 ; however , this limit is not useful for the light higgs boson that we consider here . ]",
    "we conclude that the electroweak radiative corrections to @xmath57 appear to be under control at the 12% level .",
    "we now consider the uncertainty in the sm prediction for the @xmath73 branching ratio .",
    "the radiative corrections to higgs decays to fermion and boson pairs have been reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; we give here a brief sketch of the known corrections and refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for references to the original calculations .",
    "the full qcd corrections to the higgs decay to @xmath74 are known up to three loops neglecting the quark mass in the kinematics and up to two loops for massive final - state quarks .",
    "the electroweak corrections to the higgs decay to quark or lepton pairs are known at one - loop ; in addition , the qcd corrections to the leading top - mass - enhanced electroweak correction term are known up to three loops , to order @xmath75 .",
    "all of these corrections to the higgs partial widths to fermions are included in a consistent way in the program hdecay @xcite",
    ".    for the higgs masses below the @xmath5 threshold that we consider here , decays into off - shell gauge bosons ( @xmath5 , @xmath9 ) are important and affect the total higgs width , thus feeding in to @xmath76 .",
    "hdecay takes into account decays with both @xmath40 ( @xmath35 ) bosons off - shell .",
    "one - loop electroweak corrections to higgs decays to @xmath5 and @xmath9 are known , together with the qcd corrections to the leading @xmath69 result up to three loops .",
    "these corrections to @xmath77 amount to less than about 5% in the intermediate higgs mass range @xcite ( translating to less than roughly 2% in @xmath76 for @xmath78 gev ) and have been neglected in hdecay , although their inclusion would seem straightforward .",
    "the @xmath73 branching ratio in the sm also has a parametric uncertainty due to the nonzero present experimental uncertainties in the sm input parameters .",
    "the largest sources of parametric uncertainty are the bottom quark mass and ( to a lesser extent ) the strong coupling @xmath79 ( which contributes via the qcd corrections to the @xmath80 coupling ) .",
    "this parametric uncertainty in @xmath76 was evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite to be about 1.4% for @xmath81 gev , using the standard @xmath82 @xcite and a somewhat optimistic @xmath83 gev ( @xmath84 ) @xcite .",
    "the parametric uncertainty in the branching ratio is suppressed due to the fact that @xmath85 makes up about 2/3 of the higgs total width at @xmath81 gev , leading to a partial cancellation of the uncertainty in the branching ratio ; we thus expect the parametric uncertainty to be somewhat larger at higher higgs masses , where @xmath85 no longer dominates the total width .",
    "the best measurements of @xmath79 come from lep - i and ii ; the tevatron and lhc are unlikely to improve on this .",
    "the bottom quark mass is extracted from heavy quarkonium spectroscopy and @xmath86 meson decays with a precision limited by theoretical uncertainty .",
    "there are prospects to improve the bottom quark mass extraction through better perturbative and lattice calculations @xcite and more precise measurements of the upsilon meson properties from cleo @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath87 corrections to the partial widths of the light higgs boson in the littlest higgs model .",
    "these results allow numerical calculations of the corrections to the higgs boson total width and decay branching ratios , as well as the corrections to the higgs boson production cross section in two - photon fusion and in gluon fusion .",
    "we studied the correction to the rate of @xmath2 , which is expected to be measured at a future photon collider with 2% precision for a light higgs boson with mass in the range @xmath88 gev .    for @xmath37 tev ,",
    "the correction to the @xmath2 rate is roughly @xmath89 . in order to make a theoretical prediction for the corrected rate @xmath90 with 1% precision ( i.e.",
    ", a theoretical uncertainty comfortably smaller than the experimental uncertainty of 2% ) , the correction @xmath91 need only be computed at the @xmath92 level for @xmath37 tev .",
    "we studied the precision with which the littlest higgs model parameters must be measured in order to match the photon collider precision , and conclude that measurements of the model parameters with high enough precision should be possible at the lhc over much of the relevant model parameter space .",
    "the measurement of @xmath2 provides a nontrivial test of the littlest higgs model .",
    "more interestingly , it also provides a probe of the uv completion of the nonlinear sigma model at the 10 tev scale .",
    "the loop - induced higgs coupling to photon pairs , for example , can receive corrections from the new heavy particles of the uv completion running in the loop .",
    "equivalently , the dimension-6 operator @xmath93 that gives rise to the @xmath56 coupling receives a contribution from the 10 tev scale .",
    "if the uv completion is weakly coupled , these corrections will be suppressed by the square of the ratio of the electroweak scale to the 10 tev scale , and thus be too small to detect with the expected 2% experimental resolution . if the uv completion is strongly coupled , however , the strong - coupling enhancement counteracts the suppression from the high mass scale , leading to corrections parametrically of the same order as those from the tev scale physics that should be observable at the photon collider .",
