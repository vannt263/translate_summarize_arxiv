    "local adaptivity in numerical methods for partial differential equations makes possible to solve real problems leading to a suitable approximation of the desired solution without exceeding the limits of available software .",
    "when considering isogemetric methods  @xcite , from a theoretical point of view , the design of efficient and robust strategies for local refinement constitutes a challenging problem because the tensor product structure of b - splines  @xcite is broken .",
    "hierarchical b - splines ( hb - splines ) based on the construction presented in  @xcite are a promising approach , because their construction and properties are closely related to the ones of hierarchical finite elements .",
    "moreover , truncated hierarchical b - splines ( thb - splines ) have been introduced in  @xcite , where their use as a framework for isogeometric analysis that provides local refinement possibilities has been analysed ; see also  @xcite .",
    "local approximation estimates for hierarchical spline spaces have been studied in  @xcite using quasi - interpolants described in terms of the truncated hierarchical basis while the use of thb - splines in conjunction with residual based error indicators has been proposed in  @xcite under a few assumptions on the meshes .",
    "it is important to remark that truncation is indeed a possible strategy to recover partition of unity and convex hull property . on the other hand",
    ", the procedure of truncation requires a specific construction that entails complicated basis function supports ( that may be non convex and/or not connected ) and their use may produce a non negligible overhead with an adaptive strategy .    in the present paper , we take the point of view of classical hierarchical b - splines and we study their structure with a special attention to all those properties that may be needed or may facilitate their use with an adaptive isogeometric method .",
    "when considering an underlying sequence of nested tensor - product spline spaces and the corresponding b - spline bases , a particular way of selecting b - spline basis functions from each different level in order to build a hierarchical basis @xmath0 has been established in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "this hierarchical basis @xmath0 enjoys some important properties :    * @xmath0 is a set of linearly independent b - spline functions . *",
    "it is possible to identify uniquely the basis @xmath0 from the knowledge of a hierarchical mesh . *",
    "all functions in the coarsest underlying tensor - product spline space belong to the hierarchical space @xmath1 .",
    "* under certain assumptions about the hierarchy of subdomains associated to @xmath0 , it is possible to define a multiscale quasi - interpolant operator in @xmath1 obtaining optimal orders of local approximation .",
    "* any enlargement of the hierarchy of the subdomains associated to @xmath0 gives rise to a _ refined _ basis @xmath2 in the sense that @xmath3 .    on the other hand , unlike tensor - product b - spline bases",
    ", the functions in the hierarchical basis @xmath0 do not constitute a partition of unity .",
    "if we consider the corresponding coefficients @xmath4 in order to form such a partition , i.e. , @xmath5 it is known that the coefficients @xmath6 are nonnegative , but in fact , some of them can be equal to zero .    in this article we analyse the local approximation properties of hierarchical splines spaces through the construction of a multiscale quasi - interpolant operator .",
    "kraft  @xcite has introduced such a operator for the case of bivariate spline spaces on infinite uniform knot vectors and has studied its pointwise approximation properties .",
    "we extend his results to the case of open knot vectors with possible multiple internal knots in @xmath7-dimensional domains , for @xmath8 , and we also provide local approximation estimates in @xmath9-norms , for @xmath10 .    furthermore , we propose a new hierarchical spline space , through a construction of a set of basis functions named @xmath11 that satisfies all important properties just listed above . in particular , @xmath12 , and therefore , in general , the _ new _ hierarchical space @xmath13 may be smaller than @xmath1 .",
