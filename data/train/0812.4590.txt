    "two - body breakup processes involving nuclei at high momentum and energy transfer play an important role in studies of nuclear qcd .",
    "the uniqueness of these processes is in the effectiveness by which large values of invariant energy are produced at rather moderate values of beam energy .",
    "the kinematics of two - body photodisintegration provide the relation @xmath8 in which the produced invariant energy grows with the energy of the probe twice as fast as compared , for example , to hard processes involving two protons , in which case @xmath9 . as it follows from eq.([s ] ) , already at photon energies of @xmath10  gev the produced invariant mass on one nucleon , @xmath11 , exceeds the threshold at which deep - inelastic processes become important , @xmath12  gev .    combining the above property with a requirement that the momentum transfer in the reaction exceeds the masses of the particles",
    "involved in the scattering ( @xmath13 ) one sets into a hard scattering kinematic regime , in which case we expect that only the minimal fock components dominate in the wave function of the particles involved in the scattering .",
    "assuming that all the constituents of minimal fock component participate in a hard scattering one arrives at the constituent - counting rule@xcite .",
    "according to this rule we are able to predict the energy dependence of any hard processes at fixed and large center of mass  ( c.m . ) scattering angles .",
    "for example , for the @xmath14 hard scattering process the constituent - counting rule predicts the following energy dependence for the scattering amplitude : @xmath15 with @xmath16 in eq.([qqrule_m ] ) @xmath17 is the number of constituents in the minimal fock component of the wave function of particle @xmath18 involved in the scattering .",
    "these predictions were confirmed for a wide variety of hard processes involving leptons and hadrons .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of the constituent - counting rule is that its application allows us to check the onset of quark degrees of freedom in hard reactions involving nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this is essential for probing the quark - gluon structure of nuclei .",
    "for example if quarks are involved in hard photodisintegration of the deuteron then according to eqs.([qqrule_m ] ) and ( [ crs_scale ] ) one expects that @xmath19  @xcite .    during the last decade",
    "there were several experiments in which 90@xmath20 c.m .",
    "photodisintegration of the deuteron had been studied at high photon energies @xcite .",
    "these experiments clearly demonstrated the onset of @xmath2 scaling for the differential cross section at 90@xmath20 c.m .",
    ", starting at @xmath21  gev . also , the polarization measurements@xcite were generally in agreement with the prediction of the helicity conservation  a precursor of the dominance of the mechanism of hard gluon exchange involving quarks .    even though two - body scattering experiments demonstrate clearly an onset of quark degrees of freedom in the reaction",
    ", they do not affirm the onset of the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) regime .",
    "indeed it has been argued that the validity of constituent - counting rule does not necessarily lead to the validity of pqcd(see , e.g. , refs@xcite ) . in several measurements in which the constituent quark rule works",
    "pqcd still underestimates the observed cross sections sometimes by several orders of magnitude ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the latter may indicate a substantial contribution due to nonperturbative effects although one still may expect sizable contributions from pqcd due to generally unaccounted hidden color components in the hadronic and nuclear wave functions@xcite .",
    "a similar situation also exists for the case of hard photodisintegration of the deuteron . even though experiments clearly indicate the onset of @xmath2 scaling for the cross section of these reactions at 90@xmath20c.m .",
    ", one still expects sizable nonperturbative effects . theoretical methods of calculation of these effects are very restricted .",
    "they use different approaches to incorporate nonperturbative contributions in the process of hard photodisintegration of the deuteron .",
    "the reduced nuclear amplitude  ( rna ) formalism includes some of the nonperturbative effects through the nucleon form factors@xcite , while in the quark - gluon string model  ( qgs)@xcite nonperturbative effects are accounted for through the reggeization of scattering amplitudes .",
    "also recently , large c.m .",
    "angle photodisintegration of the deuteron for photon energies up to 2  gev was calculated within point - form relativistic quantum mechanics approximation@xcite in which the strength of the reaction was determined by short range properties of the @xmath1 interaction potential .    in the qcd hard rescattering model  (",
    "hrm)@xcite it is assumed that the energetic photon knocks - out a quark from one nucleon in the deuteron which subsequently experiences hard rescattering with a quark of the second nucleon .",
    "the latter leads to the production of two nucleons with large relative momentum .",
    "the summation of all the relevant rescattering diagrams results in a scattering amplitude in that the hard rescattering is determined by the large - momentum transfer @xmath6 scattering amplitude , which includes noncalculable nonperturbative contributions .",
    "experimental data are used to estimate the hard @xmath6 scattering amplitude .",
    "the hrm allows us to calculate the absolute cross section of @xmath22 c.m .",
    "hard photodisintegration of the deuteron without using additional adjustable parameters .",
    "also , within the qgs@xcite approximation and the hrm@xcite rather reasonable agreement has been obtained for polarization observables@xcite .",
    "although all the above - mentioned models describe the major characteristics of hard photodisintegration of the deuteron they are based on very different approaches in the calculation of the nonperturbative parts of the photodisintegration reaction .",
    "to investigate further the validity of these approaches it was suggested in ref.@xcite to extend the studies of high energy two - body photodisintegration to the case of large angle c.m .",
    "breakup of two protons from the @xmath0he target . in this case",
    "not only do the predictions of the above - described models ( rna , qgs , hrm ) for absolute cross section diverge significantly , but also the two - proton breakup reaction from @xmath0he provides additional observables such as spectator - neutron momentum distributions that can be used to check further the validity of the models .",
    "the analysis of the first experimental data on @xmath5 photodisintegration of @xmath0he nucleus at high momentum transfer is currently in progress at jefferson lab@xcite .",
    "it may significantly advance our understanding of the mechanism of hard breakup reactions involving nuclei .",
    "in the present work we carry out detailed studies of reactions involving hard breakup of both @xmath5 and @xmath6 pairs from the @xmath0he target .",
    "we demonstrate that comparative study of @xmath5 and @xmath6 breakup processes allows us to gain new insight into the nature of large c.m .",
    "angle scattering .",
    "one of the observations is that the relative strength of @xmath5 to @xmath6 breakup is larger than the one observed in low energy reactions .",
    "this is related to the onset of quark degrees of freedom in hard breakup reactions in which effectively more charges are exchanged between two protons than between proton and neutron .",
    "another signature of the hrm is that the shapes of the energy dependencies of @xmath3-scaled differential cross sections of @xmath5 and @xmath6 breakup reactions mirror the shapes of the energy dependencies of @xmath4-scaled differential cross sections of hard elastic @xmath5 and @xmath6 scatterings .    within",
    "the hrm one observes also that @xmath5 and @xmath6 hard breakup processes are sensitive to different components of the @xmath0he ground state wave function .",
    "this results in different spectator - nucleon momentum dependencies for @xmath5 and @xmath6 hard breakup cross sections .    because of the different ground state wave function components involved in @xmath5 and @xmath6 breakup reactions , the hrm also predicts significantly different magnitudes for transferred longitudinal polarizations for these two processes .",

    "the fast quark is knocked out from a low - momentum nucleon in the nucleus by an incoming photon .",
    "this approach is an alternative to the models in which it is assumed that the incoming photon breaks the preexisting two - nucleon state which has very large relative momentum in the nucleus .",
    "the validity of the hrm is based on the observation that the ground state wave functions of light nuclei peak strongly at small momenta of bound nucleons , @xmath46 .",
    "thus , diagrams in which an energetic photon interacts with bound nucleons of small momenta will strongly dominate the diagrams in which the photon interacts with bound nucleons that have relative momenta @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting scenario that the hrm sketches out is as follows ( see e.g. fig.[fig.1 ] ) : first , the incoming photon will knock out a quark from one of the nucleons in the nucleus and then the struck quark that now carries almost the whole momentum of the photon will share its momentum with a quark from the other nucleon through the exchanged gluon .",
    "the resulting two energetic quarks will recombine with the residual quark - gluon systems to produce two nucleons with large relative momentum  ( @xmath48@xmath27 ) .",
    "this recombination will contain gluon exchanges and also incalculable nonperturbative interactions .",

    "the difference of the cross sections due to the different composition of the nuclear spectral functions entering the @xmath5 and @xmath6 breakup reactions can be seen in fig.[fig.al_dep](b ) in which case one calculates the ratio of @xmath6 to @xmath5 breakup cross sections normalized to their values at @xmath255 .",
    "the drop of the ratio in fig.[fig.al_dep].(b ) at values close to @xmath255 is due to the suppression of the same - helicity two - proton component in the ground state nuclear wave function at small momenta . in this case",
    "the spectral function is sensitive to the higher angular momentum components of the ground state nuclear wave function .",
    "this yields a wider momentum distribution for the @xmath5 spectral function as compared to that for @xmath6 because no same - helicity state suppression exits for the latter .",
    "the estimates indicate that differences in @xmath285 dependencies of @xmath5 and @xmath6 breakup cross sections are rather large and can play an additional role in checking the validity of the hrm .",
    "one of the unique properties of the hard rescattering mechanism of two - nucleon breakup is that the helicity of the nucleon from which a quark is struck is predominantly defined by the helicity of the incoming photon @xmath310 [ see eq.([ampl5 ] ) ] .",
    "this is based on the fact that in the massless quark limit the helicity of the struck quark equals the helicity of the photon , @xmath133 , and assuming that at large @xmath311 the quark carries almost all the helicity of the parent nucleon one obtains @xmath312 .",
    "because within the hrm , the energetic struck quark shares its momentum with a quark of the other nucleon through a hard gluon exchange , it will retain its initial helicity when it merges into the final outgoing nucleon .",
    "it will also have @xmath313 , which allows us to conclude that the final outgoing nucleon will acquire the large part of struck quark s ( as well as the photon s ) helicity .",
    "this mechanism will result in a large ( photon ) polarization transfer for the hard two - nucleon breakup reactions .",
    "an observable that is sensitive to polarization transfer processes is the quantity @xmath314 , which for a circularly polarized photon measures the asymmetry of the hard breakup reaction with respect to the helicity of the outgoing proton .",
    "a large value of @xmath314 was predicted within the hrm for the hard breakup of the deuteron in ref.@xcite that was observed in the recent experiment of ref.@xcite .",
    "for the case of the @xmath0he target an additional experimental observation will be a comparison of @xmath314 asymmetries for @xmath5 and @xmath6 breakup channels .",
    "for the @xmath0he target we define @xmath314 as follows : @xmath315 using eq.([ampl5 ] ) and the definitions of eq.([phis ] ) for @xmath314 one obtains @xmath316 where @xmath317 and @xmath318 .    as follows from eqs.([cz2 ] ) and",

    "the hard rescattering mechanism of a two - nucleon breakup from the @xmath0he nucleus at large c.m .",
    "angles is based on the assumption of the dominance of quark - gluon degrees of freedom in the hard scattering process involving two nucleons .",
    "the model explicitly assumes that the photodisintegration process proceeds through the knock - out of a quark from one nucleon with a subsequent rescattering of that quark with a quark from the second nucleon .",
    "while photon - quark scattering is calculated explicitly , the sum of all possible quark rescatterings is related to the hard elastic @xmath1 scattering amplitude .",
    "such a relation is found assuming that quark - interchange amplitudes give the dominant contribution in the hard elastic @xmath1 scattering .",
    "the model allows one to calculate the cross sections of the hard breakup of @xmath6 and @xmath5 pairs from @xmath0he expressing them through the amplitudes of elastic @xmath6 and @xmath5 scatterings , respectively .",
    "several results of the hrm are worth mentioning : first , the hrm predicts an approximate @xmath2 scaling consistent with the predictions of the quark - counting rule .",
    "however , the model by itself is nonperturbative because the bulk of the incalculable part of the scattering amplitude is hidden in the amplitude of the @xmath1 scattering that is taken from the experiment .",
    "second , because the hard @xmath1 scattering amplitude enters into the final amplitude of the photodisintegration reaction , the shape of the energy dependence of the @xmath3 weighted breakup cross section reflects the shape of the @xmath4 weighted @xmath1 elastic scattering cross section . because of a better accuracy of @xmath5 elastic scattering data for @xmath277  gev@xmath58 , we are able to predict a specific shape for the energy dependence of the hard @xmath5 breakup cross section at photon energies up to @xmath324  gev .",
    "another observations is that , when @xmath2 scaling is established , the hrm predicts an increase of the strength of the @xmath5 breakup cross section relative to the @xmath6 breakup as compared to the low energy results .",
    "this is due to the feature that within the quark - interchange mechanism of @xmath1 scattering one has more charges flowing between nucleons in the @xmath5 pair than in the @xmath6 pair .",
    "this situation is opposite in the low energy regime when no charged meson exchanges exist for the @xmath5 pair .",
    "even though the large charge factor is involved in the @xmath5 breakup its cross section is still by a factor of ten smaller than the cross section of the @xmath6 breakup . within the hrm ,",
    "this is due to cancellation between the helicity conserving amplitudes @xmath225 and @xmath226 , which have opposite signs for the @xmath5 scattering .",
    "because of the smallness of the @xmath5 breakup cross section , within the eikonal approximation , we estimated the possible contribution of three - body / two - step processes in which the initial two - body hard @xmath6 breakup is followed by the charge - exchange rescattering of an energetic neutron off the spectator proton .",
    "we found that this contribution has @xmath250 energy dependence and is a small correction for spectator nucleon momenta @xmath325150  mev/@xmath30 .",
    "however , the three - body / two - step process will dominate the hard @xmath5 breakup contribution at large transverse momenta of the spectator nucleon starting at @xmath326  mev/@xmath30 .",
    "the next result of the hrm is the prediction of different spectator - momentum dependencies of breakup cross section for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 pairs .",
    "this result follows from the fact that the ground state wave function of @xmath0he containing two protons with the same helicity is significantly suppressed as compared to the same component in the @xmath6 pair .",
    "because of this , the @xmath5 spectral function is sensitive to the higher angular momentum components of the nuclear ground state wave function .",
    "these components generate wider momentum distribution as compared to say the @xmath213 component of the wave function . as a result",
    "the cross section of the @xmath5 breakup reaction exhibits wider momentum distribution as compared to the @xmath6 cross section .",
    "additionally because of the strong @xmath256 dependence of the reaction , the cross section exhibits an asymmetry in the light - cone momentum distribution of the spectator nucleon , favoring larger values of @xmath285 .",
    "the final result of the hrm is the strong difference in prediction of the polarization transfer asymmetry for @xmath5 and @xmath6 breakup reactions for circularly polarized photons . because of the suppression of the same helicity @xmath5 components in the @xmath0he ground state wave function",
    ", the dominant helicity conserving @xmath278 component will not contribute to the polarization transfer process involving two protons .",
    "because of this effect , the hrm predicts longitudinal polarization transfer @xmath327 , for the @xmath5 breakup to be close to zero .",
    "because no such suppression exists for the @xmath6 breakup , the hrm predicts a rather large magnitude for @xmath328 .    even though the hrm model does not contain free parameters , for numerical estimates we use the magnitude of elastic @xmath1 cross sections as well as some properties of the @xmath1 helicity amplitudes",
    "this introduces certain error in our prediction of the magnitudes of the breakup cross sections . for the @xmath6 breakup",
    "this error is mainly related to the uncertainty in the magnitude of the absolute cross section of hard elastic @xmath6 scattering which is on the level 30% . for the @xmath5 breakup",
    "the main source of the uncertainty is the magnitude of the cancellation between @xmath225 and @xmath226 , which is sensitive to the angular distribution of helicity amplitudes .",
    "the uncertainty due to the angular function is on the level of 40  % .",
    "these uncertainties should be considered on top of the theoretical uncertainties that the hrm contains due to approximations such as estimating the scattering amplitude at maximal value of the nuclear wave function at @xmath125 .",
    "the latter may introduce an uncertainty as much as @xmath177 in the breakup cross section .",
    "in conclusion we expect that experimental verification of all above - mentioned predictions may help us to verify the validity of the hard rescattering model",

    "<S> we investigate a large angle photodisintegration of two nucleons from the @xmath0he nucleus within the framework of the hard rescattering model ( hrm ) . in the hrm a quark of one nucleon knocked out by an incoming photon rescatters with a quark of the other nucleon leading to the production of two nucleons with large relative momentum . assuming the dominance of the quark - interchange mechanism in a hard nucleon - nucleon scattering , the hrm allows the expression of the amplitude of a two - nucleon break - up reaction through the convolution of photon - quark scattering , @xmath1 hard scattering amplitude and nuclear spectral function which can be calculated using a nonrelativistic @xmath0he wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the photon - quark scattering amplitude can be explicitly calculated in the high energy regime , whereas for @xmath1 scattering one uses the fit of the available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the hrm predicts several specific features for the hard breakup reaction . </S>",
    "<S> first , the cross section will approximately scale as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the @xmath3 weighted cross section will have the shape of energy dependence similar to that of @xmath4 weighted @xmath1 elastic scattering cross section . </S>",
    "<S> also one predicts an enhancement of the @xmath5 breakup relative to the @xmath6 breakup cross section as compared to the results from low energy kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> another result is the prediction of different spectator momentum dependencies of @xmath5 and @xmath6 breakup cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that same - helicity @xmath5-component is strongly suppressed in the ground state wave function of @xmath0he . because of this suppression the hrm predicts significantly different asymmetries for the cross section of polarization transfer @xmath1 breakup reactions for circularly polarized photons . for the @xmath5 breakup </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry is predicted to be zero while for the @xmath6 it is close to @xmath7 . </S>"
