    "in view of its importance in explaining the observational cosmology many authors have considered cosmological models with dark energy . in a recent paper kremer @xcite has modelled the universe as a binary mixture whose constitutes are described by a van der waals fluid and by a dark energy density .",
    "@xcite showed that `` tracker field '' , a form of qiuntessence , may explain the coincidence , adding new motivation for the quintessence scenario .",

    "since the theoretical arguments and recent experimental data support the existence of an anisotropic phase that approaches an isotropic one , it makes sense to consider the models of universe with anisotropic back - ground in presence of dark energy .",
    "the simplest of anisotropic models , which nevertheless rather completely describe the anisotropic effects , are bianchi type - i ( bi ) homogeneous models whose spatial sections are flat but the expansion or contraction rate is direction - dependent . in a number of papers ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite , we have studied the role of a @xmath2 term in the evolution of a bi space - time in presence of spinor and/or scalar field with a perfect fluid satisfying the equation of state @xmath0 . in this paper we study the evolution of an initially anisotropic universe given by a bi spacetime in presence of a perfect fluid obeying not only @xmath0 , but also the van der waals equation of state .",

    "soon after e. hubble had experimentally established that the universe is expanding , einstein returned to the original form of his equations citing his temporary modification of them as the biggest blunder of his life .",

    "finally after the pioneer paper by a. guth @xcite on inflationary cosmology researchers began to study the models with @xmath2 term with growing interest .",
    "note that in our previous papers @xcite we studied the einstein field equations where the cosmological term appears with a negative sign . here",
    "following the original paper by einstein and one by sahni @xcite we choose the sign to be positive . in this paper",
