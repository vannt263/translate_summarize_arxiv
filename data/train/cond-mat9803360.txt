    "when in a cold winter morning at the start of 1976 one of us ( gc ) entered the institute of nuclear physics of the siberian division of the ussr academy of sciences in akademgorodok , the main purpose was to discuss with the author boris v. chirikov , a startling paper which appeared as a cern preprint at the end of the sixties@xcite .",
    "except to few , the paper remained almost unnoticed and practically none had the perception that this paper was a cornerstone of the new building of nonlinear science which , only few years later , expanded in an impressive way . among other things , the so - called standard map or chirikov map was discussed as a model of classical dynamical chaos",
    ". it was in that same occasion that we quantized the map thus obtaining the quantum kicked rotor which became later a basic model for the study of quantum chaos@xcite .",
    "the importance of the chirikov map lies in the fact that it gives an approximate description of a wide class of dynamical systems . as a matter of fact it contains most of the complex features of dynamical motion . for these reasons",
    "its properties are continuously being studied and it is used in university courses to teach the emergence of random motion in deterministic systems .    in the quantum world",
    "the standard map played a fundamental role in bridging different fields of research : solid state physics , atomic physics , random matrix theory .",
    "in particular it allowed to discover the phenomenon of quantum dynamical localization namely the fact that quantum interference effects suppress the classical diffusive process and lead to localization of the quantum excitation .",
    "this phenomenon had then been observed in several laboratory experiments in atomic physics@xcite and , more recently , a physical microscopic realization of the kicked rotator had been possible @xcite .",
    "all the above experiments refer to systems under external perturbations .",
    "it was however not clear how quantum localization could take place in conservative systems . indeed in this case",
    "an eigenfucntion ( ef ) is always a superposition of a practically a finite number of unperturbed efs and therefore it is not even clear what localization should mean here .    in refs.@xcite , by using a well known model of quantum conservative systems , the so - called wbrm model , it was shown that efs can be localized inside the energy shell .",
    "more precisely , an ergodicity parameter @xmath0 was introduced which acts as a scaling parameter . for @xmath1",
    "the efs are localized inside the energy shell @xmath2 , while for @xmath3 the efs are extended or ergodic .",
    "the width @xmath2 is the width ot the local density of states ( ldos ) or strength function .",
    "therefore for @xmath3 an ef actually excites the maximum number of unperturbed states .",
    "as it is quite evident this problem calls in question the notion of quantum ergodicity @xcite .",
    "it was then shown that quantum localization actually takes place in a more physical model of conservative systems : the billiard in a stadium @xcite . the same effect",
    "was successively confirmed in a different shape , classically chaotic , billiard @xcite .",
    "the question remains open however , whether or not the mechanism of localization is the same as in wbrm . in particular",
    "it is necessary to understand how the structure of ef changes as one moves from the perturbative regime to the region of complete ergodicity .    in this paper , on the basis of the results of @xcite , we discuss in detail the above problem .",
    "we show that contrary to wbrm , localization here manifests via the sparsity of the structure of the efs and we surmise that this should be a general feature of localization in conservative systems .",
    "we also show that the presence of cantori in the classical motion plays an important role in the quantum motion .",
    "the `` quantum cantori '' should be observable in real laboratory experiments .",
    "in this paper we mainly consider a _ stadium billiard _ , that is the motion of a free point particle of unit mass and velocity @xmath4 ( energy @xmath5 ) bouncing elastically inside a stadium - shaped well : two semicircles of radius @xmath6 connected by two straight line segments of length @xmath7 . the classical motion , for arbitrary small @xmath8 , is ergodic , mixing and exponentially unstable with lyapunov exponent @xmath9 .",
    "it can be approximated ( up to @xmath10 ) with the discontinuous stadium - map @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the rescaled angular momentum , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the polar angle ( identical to the arc - length for small @xmath8 ) .",
    "note that , due to symmetry , the stadium map ( [ eq : stadiummap ] ) has a period @xmath15 in the angle @xmath14 .",
    "one should note also that the stadium map is topologically similar to the sawtooth map @xmath16 the behaviour of the sawtooth map ( 2 ) has been studied analytically and numerically in great detail @xcite . for the stadium billiard , due to the classical chaotic motion , the angular momentum @xmath17 undergoes , for small @xmath8 , a process of diffusive behaviour @xmath18 with diffusion rate @xmath19 which may depend on local value of angular momentum @xmath17 .",
    "rigorous results on the sawtooth - map @xcite have shown that the diffusion rate goes as @xmath20 if @xmath21 or @xmath22 if @xmath23 .",
    "the same dependence @xmath24 on the small control parameter @xmath8 has been numerically found in @xcite for the billiard and for the map ( [ eq : stadiummap ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath25 in the local shift of angular momentum leads to a dependence of diffusion rate on the local value of angular momentum . as a result",
    ", it is easily seen that , for the map ( [ eq : stadiummap ] ) : @xmath26 where the prefactor @xmath27 has been numerically computed . in figure 1",
    "we show the weak dependence of @xmath28 on the local angular momentum @xmath17 for various values of the parameter @xmath8 in the stadium billiard .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) gives the diffusion rate in the discrete time @xmath29 .",
    "the physical time @xmath30 between collisions depends on the local angular momentum , namely @xmath31 .",
    "since the stadium billiard is mixing , the classical dynamics will lead to the microcanonical equilibrium distribution .",
    "this implies that the equilibrium distribution of angular momenta is uniform in the discrete time @xmath32 ( invariant measure of the approximate poincar ' e map ( [ eq : stadiummap ] ) ) while , in the continuous time , it obeys the semicircle distribution @xmath33 ( invariant measure of the smooth dynamics in the full phase space ) .",
    "the power @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) ( instead of @xmath35 as found for smooth deformations of the circle @xcite ) , is due to the existence of _ cantori _ in the classical billiard motion which are also typical of discontinuous maps like ( [ eq : stadiummap],[eq : sawtoothmap ] ) the cantori form strong obstacles to phase space transport and therefore they reduce the diffusion rate ( even if the diffusion remains normal ) .",
    "it is important to evaluate the flux @xmath36 of the phase space area which is transported through a cantorus in one iteration of the map .",
    "for the sawtooth map there are no dominant cantori in phase space and the flux @xmath36 is independent of the winding number of the resonance and is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for small values of the control parameter @xmath39 the flux goes as @xmath40 .",
    "we can now use this result to estimate the flux through cantori for the stadium map for small @xmath8 .",
    "we obtain @xmath41 which incorporates the correct energy scaling of phase space area .",
    "the size of a cantorus @xmath42 , in the rescaled angular momentum variable @xmath43 , that is @xmath44 , averaged over all the resonances , can be estimated from the exact results on sawtooth map @xcite . after averaging over all the resonances one finds that the average size is proportional to the parameter @xmath8 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is some numerical constant . from our numerical computations on the stadium , @xmath46 turns out to be in the range @xmath47 for eps=0.05 , and @xmath48 for eps = 0.005 .",
    "the fact that @xmath46 slowly increases with decreasing eps is due to existence of the cantorus along the separatrix of 2:1 resonance ( around @xmath49 ) which has a larger size and scales as @xmath50 . in figure",
    "2a we illustrate the structure of cantori by showing a phase space portrait of a typical orbit ( @xmath51 ) around the largest 2:1 resonance .",
    "in this section we consider the structure of quantum eigenfunctions for the stadium billiard @xmath52 which are solutions of the helmholz equation @xmath53 with consecutive eigenenergies @xmath54 .",
    "we consider only odd - odd states with dirichlet boundary conditions on the quarter - stadium .",
    "it is interesting to consider the eigenstates @xmath55 of the stadium billiard expressed in terms of eigenstates of the nearest integrable billiard , namely the circle billiard .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the unit quarter - circle billiard are @xmath56 where @xmath57 are zeros of even - order bessel functions .",
    "one may expand an eigenstate of the stadium billiard ( for small is not really small , in order to be able to express the eigenfunctions of the stadium in terms of eigenfunctions of the circle , one should consider the smallest enscribing circle billiard with radius @xmath58 . ]",
    "@xmath8 ) in terms of eigenstates of a quarter - circle billiard @xmath59 the probability of having a value @xmath60 of angular momentum ( only even values of angular momentum are allowed due to symmetry ) is @xmath61 if quantum eigenstates were ergodic one would expect to recover the classical microcanonical distribution ( [ eq : mc ] ) of angular momentum namely one would expect the quantum distribution @xmath62    however , since the classical motion is approximated by the map ( 1 ) , then in analogy with the quantization of the standard map , one would expect the phenomenon of quantum localization to take place with localization length @xmath63 proportional to the classical diffusion rate @xmath64 the localization length @xmath63 , which is defined more precisely below ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : ll ] ) , section 6 ) , measures the ( average ) number of excited angular momentum eigenfunctions , that is the average width of the probability distribution @xmath65 .    in a bound conservative system like the stadium however , there are two main peculiarities which influence the process of quantum localization . first , the range of variation of angular momentum @xmath17 is finite , @xmath66 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this implies the existence of an upper bound for the localization length which is defined by the condition @xmath67 .",
    "this leads , together with ( [ eq : ld ] ) , to the _ delocalization or ergodicity border _",
    "@xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the sequential quantum number in the stadium billiard",
    ". therefore , in order to observe ` dynamical ' localization , this border must be above the _ perturbative border_. the perturbative border is given simply by the condition @xmath70 , which states that the length of the straight line segment of the stadium should be at least one de broglie wavelength in order to be visible to quantum mechanics @xmath71 .",
    "the same border can be obtained from the map ( [ eq : stadiummap ] ) via the condition that in one iteration the change in angular momentum is at least one quantum @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , for small values of the parameter @xmath8 the two borders are well separated @xmath73 and is possible to observe localization as actually done in @xcite .",
    "the second peculiarity is due to the presence of cantori .",
    "already long ago it has been surmised by mckay and meiss @xcite that cantori may act as perfect barriers for the quantum motion if the flux through cantori , for each iteration of the quantum map , is less than one planck s cell .",
    "however , to our knowledge , this effect has never been observed neither numerically nor experimentally and therefore it is not really known whether the above condition actually plays a role in quantum mechanics . for our present case of the stadium map this border",
    "can be estimated from the flux ( [ eq : flux ] ) @xmath74 ( note that we have @xmath75 ) , and gives @xmath76 it is interesting to observe that , for sufficiently small @xmath8 , this border is well separated from the other two borders @xmath77 and should be ( numerically or experimentally ) observable .",
    "hence , for small values of the control parameter @xmath8 , we expect to see four different regimes in the quantum dynamics of the stadium biliard : ( 1 ) perturbative regime for @xmath78 , ( 2 ) pseudo - integrable or cantori regime where eigenstates are expected to be localized on classical cantori , for @xmath79 , ( 3 ) dynamical localization for @xmath80 , and finally ( 4 ) for sufficiently large energy , @xmath81 , we should enter the regime of quantum ergodicity where ( [ eq : qe ] ) holds .",
    "here we would like to illustrate explicitly the effect of cantori on quantum eigenfunctions . in the regime where @xmath82 it is natural to expect that cantori will influence the localization process . indeed , as shown above , in such situation the cantori act as perfect barriers , and the quantum system looks as if classically integrable @xcite .",
    "it is therefore expected that the localization length of eigenstates must be of the order of the size of cantori . on the other hand , since for small @xmath8",
    "the cantori border can be much higher than the perturbative border , we may have here a nice possibility to study the effect of cantori in quantum mechanics .",
    "the average size of cantori has been found analytically and numerically to be ( see section ii , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sizeofc ] ) ) @xmath83 with @xmath46 a numerical constant . in figure",
    "2b we show an eigenstate in angular momentum basis in the cantori region near the 2:1 resonance . in figure 3 ( and also figure 4 ) our numerical data show that at @xmath84 the behaviour of localization length changes : for @xmath85 namely below the cantori border the localization length agrees with the theoretical estimate ( [ eq : lc ] ) .",
    "this provides the first numerical evidence that the idea of flux quantization through cantori introduced in@xcite is indeed correct .",
    "even more convincing is the inspection of individual quantum eigenstates in the husimi phase space representation ( see figure 5 ) which show very clearly , that in the cantori region , the relative phase space area occupied by the localized eigenstates does not increase with increasing @xmath8 or with increasing @xmath86 .",
    "we checked this even quantitatively , by computing the phase space area of husimi phase space distributions via information entropy or inverse participation ratio @xcite .",
    "the width of husimi functions on quantized cantori in the perpendicular direction is given only by the width of the wavepacket which is used for the computation of husimi functions ( see section vi ) .",
    "above the quantum cantori border @xmath84 the flux through the turnstiles becomes larger than a planck s cell , the cantori do not act any more as barriers for quantum dynamics and the quantum motion starts to follow the classical diffusive behaviour up to the quantum relaxation time @xmath87 ( break time ) , which is proportional to the density of _ operative eigenstates _ namely of those states which enter the initial condition and therefore actually control the quantum dynamics .",
    "for @xmath88 instead , the quantum dynamics enter an oscillatory regime around the stationary localized state .",
    "the density of operative eigenstates is by a factor @xmath89 smaller than the total density of states @xmath90 and therefore the relaxation time is less than the heisenberg time which is given by the level density . the angular momentum width @xmath63 of the localized state is then given by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the average time between bounces .",
    "this leads to the simple expression for the average ( scaled ) localization length @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a constant to be determined numerically .",
    "we need however to take into account the fact that for @xmath85 the width of eigenfunctions is determined by classical cantori and not by dynamical localization .",
    "since we measure the localization length in angular momentum space , then for @xmath95 , we need to add the average size of cantori to the angular momentum spread due to dynamical localization .",
    "therefore , above the cantori border @xmath96 , we expect the following expression for the numerical ( scaled ) localization length @xmath97 , @xmath98 which takes into account the fact that we need to rescale the total size of angular momentum space , and that for @xmath84 , @xmath99 which is the average size of cantori as determined numerically . in figure 3",
    "( see also figure 4 ) it is seen that expression ( [ eq : resc ] ) is in excellent agreement with our numerical data up to @xmath100 @xmath101 and for different values of @xmath8 .",
    "the obtained value of the numerical constant is @xmath102 .",
    "notice that only for very small @xmath8 the constant contribution due to cantori in ( [ eq : resc ] ) will be negligible and localization length would be simply proportional to @xmath103 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynloc ] ) .",
    "notice also that due to the discontinuity of the stadium map , the quantum eigenfunctions are not exponentially localized , like for the standard map or for smooth chaotic billiards @xcite , but they have power - law tails @xmath104 this is consistent with results based on the quantization of the stadium map @xcite , and with rigorous results on band random matrices with increasing band size @xcite . in figure 6",
    "we show two ( averaged ) localized states in angular momentum basis in which the power law tails are clearly seen .",
    "the pseudo - integrable ( cantori ) regime may also be detected by inspecting the energy level statistics , e.g. the commonly studied nearest neighbour level spacing distribution @xmath105 , the delta3 statistics etc .",
    "as an example in figure 7 we show that @xmath105 is nearly poissonian in cantori regime while it is intermediate between poisson and wigner ( goe ) in the regime of dynamical localization .",
    "we would like to stress that the above deviations from goe predictions have no relation with periodic orbit theory and bouncing ball orbits .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath106 of the stadium billiard may be written as a small deformation of the integrable circle billiard @xmath107 , namely @xmath108 .",
    "the exact stadium - eigenstates may be expanded in terms of unperturbed quarter - cirlce eigenstates @xmath109 where @xmath110",
    "are the eigenvalues of the integrable quarter - circle  the zeros of the even - order bessel functions ( [ eq : express ] ) . or , vice versa",
    ", we can express eigenstates of integrable quarter - circle in terms of exact eigenstates of the perturbed billiard by the same ( orthogonal ) matrix of coefficients @xmath111 , @xmath112    it is important to note that unlike for wigner - band - random matrices @xcite the matrix of coefficients @xmath113 , ordered with increasing wavenumber ( energy ) , has been found to have a symmetric appearance ( see figure 8a for an example ) .",
    "the structure of rows ( expansions of exact states in terms of circle states ) is very similar to the structure of columns ( expansions of circle states in terms of exact states ) .",
    "the effective bandwidth @xmath114 of the matrix @xmath111 determines the width of the energy shell @xmath115 while the effective number of nonzero entries in each row ( fixed @xmath29 ) is proportional to the localization length @xmath63 of that state @xmath55 .",
    "such a symmetry between perturbed and unperturbed states seems to be generic for conservative hamiltonian systems .",
    "indeed , a similar structure of the matrix of coefficients has been found for the chaotic rough billiards ( with shapes of wiggled circles ) introduced in @xcite as well .",
    "however , the bandwidth @xmath114 for the stadium billiard has been found to take always its maximal value , that is @xmath116 independent of the parameter @xmath8 , except in the perturbative regime @xmath78 where it becomes smaller .",
    "this should be contrasted with chaotic rough billiards @xcite for which , below the so called wigner - ergodicity border , the bandwidth @xmath114 has been found to decrease as @xmath117 .    below the ergodicity border , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , the matrix @xmath120 is sparse in both horizontal and vertical directions ( see figure 8a ) .",
    "( note that the same is true also for the rough billiard ) as a consequence of that , the averaged local density of states ( ldos ) , @xmath121 ( averaged columns shifted to the same center ) is nearly the same as average ef in circular basis @xmath122 ( average rows shifted to the same mean ) .",
    "see figure 8b .",
    "both distributions , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , agree quite well with the theoretical distribution @xmath125 which has been proposed@xcite for ldos of nearly circular billiards in the regime of quantum ( shnirelman ) ergodicity .",
    "such structure is found in the regime of dynamical localization as well as in the regime of cantori localization where the quantum system behaves as if classically integrable .",
    "we would like to stress that for the case of wbrm there is instead a strong asymmetry in the sense that the ef s are solid and narrow , namely they are localized inside the energy shell , while the expansion of a basis state in terms of exact ef s shows a sparse structure @xcite .",
    "in order to check the above theoretical predictions we had to compute numerically the quantum eigenfunctions @xmath126 of chaotic billiards which are solutions of the schr \" odinger equation @xmath127 ( where @xmath128 ) satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions along the boundary .",
    "we had to compute eigenstates with extremely large sequential quantum numbers @xmath100 of the desymmetrized stadium billiard ( and also of the rough billiards ) up to @xmath129 .",
    "we have used a recently proposed scaling method @xcite , but we expanded quantum eigenfunctions @xmath130 in terms of more suitable circular waves ( here we consider only odd - odd states ) @xmath131 instead of the originally proposed plane waves .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath86 is determined by minimizing a certain positive bilinear form along the boundary of the billiard @xcite .",
    "this can be done by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem of dimension @xmath132 which yields @xmath133 accurate eigenvalues @xmath134 and eigenvectors @xmath135 simultaneously .",
    "therefore , with this method , the computer workload required per energy level is by a factor @xmath136 or even @xmath137 ( namely from @xmath138 to @xmath139 for @xmath140 ) smaller than with more traditional methods , like the original heller s plane wave decomposition or boundary integral method !",
    "note that the magnitude of coefficients @xmath135 is proportional to the probability ( [ eq : pn ] ) of having angular momentum @xmath60 in a quantum state @xmath55 , @xmath141 the number of levels below a given wavenumber @xmath136 or energy @xmath142 , in a desymmetrized billiard , is given by the weyl formula @xmath143 .",
    "the effective spread in angular momentum of an eigenstates @xmath144 is characterized by the localization length @xmath63 which measures the typical number of @xmath65 values which are substantially different from zero , or the size of the angular momentum interval in which @xmath145 is significantly different than zero .",
    "of course , there is no a unique definition of localization length .",
    "in particular the choice is quite delicate for the quantum stadium where localization is algebraic unlike billiards with smooth boundary where localization is expected to be exponential .",
    "we have therefore considered four different working definitions : ( i ) spread in angular momentum @xmath146 ( ii ) information entropy @xmath147 ( iii ) inverse participation ratio , @xmath148 ^ 2)^{-1},\\ ] ] ( iv ) @xmath149 probability localization length @xmath150 the numerical constants @xmath151 have been determined with the condition that @xmath152 should take the maximal value @xmath153 in the regime of quantum ergodicity .",
    "all the four definitions of localization length give _",
    "qualitatively _ the same results .",
    "however , the @xmath149 localization length ( [ eq : ll ] ) which is proportional to the minimal number of angular momentum eigenvalues that are needed to support @xmath149 probability , is the least sensitive to the slowly ( algebraically ) decaying tails of the distribution @xmath145 and has given the sharpest and less fluctuating numerical results .",
    "the results shown in figures @xmath154 and @xmath155 were obtained using the definition ( [ eq : ll ] ) of localization length with the numerical value@xmath156 .      in figure 5",
    "we show husimi functions of ( quarter ) stadium eigenstates on the poincar ' e - birhkoff section , with coordinates @xmath157 .",
    "the desymmetrized phase space is a rectangle @xmath158\\times[0,k ] , k=\\sqrt{2e}$ ] .",
    "we consider ( almost ) minimal wavepackets @xmath159 at phase space point @xmath160 , which in the angle representation @xmath161 , @xmath162 read @xmath163 where @xmath164 is a normalization constant and @xmath165 is the aspect ratio . we take @xmath166 which means that the wavepacket has the same relative size in both directions . the husimi function @xmath167 of a billiard eigenstate @xmath168",
    "is computed w.r.t .",
    "the normal derivative of an eigenfunction along the boundary @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 where the numerical integration along the boundary of the billiard has been performed accurately using high - order gaussian quadratures .",
    "the billiard in a stadium is a very clean mathematical model of classical chaos and it is therefore particularly convenient to study the modifications that quantum mechanics introduces in our general picture of deterministic chaos . while the classical motion is ergodic and mixing for any non zero values of the parameter @xmath8 , the quantum motion , as we have seen in this paper , exhibits a very rich structure and different regimes of motion as a function of the parameter @xmath8 or the energy @xmath142 .",
    "two are the main points we would like to stress : a ) classical cantori may have strong effects on quantum mechanics .",
    "they lead to a new quantum border which is distinct from the perturbative border and from the localization border . in the regime of",
    "_ quantum cantori _ the rescaled localization length @xmath172 does not depend on energy or wavenumber @xmath136 . in other words , the quantum dynamics is basically determined by the classical structure .",
    "this effect should be observable in real experiments .",
    "b ) the mechanism of localization is strictly connected to the sparsity of ef s when expanded on the basis of unperturbed circle states ( or vice versa , sparsity of unperturbed states when expanded in terms of the stadium ef s ) .",
    "when we increase perturbation ( or decrease @xmath173 ) , sparsity decreases , localization length of ef s increases until the delocalized or quantum ergodic regime is reached .",
    "we conjecture that this mechanism of localization is typical of conservative hamiltonian systems .",
    "quite interestingly , the mechanism of localization in wbrm is quite different and is associated to an asymmetry between ef s ( solid and narrow ) and unperturbed states ( delocalized but sparse ) . in this sense",
    ", wbrm can not be taken to represent the typical behaviour of classically chaotic conservative systems .    the main impulse to the present paper originated from a previous work of b.chirikov@xcite in which a wiggled circle billiard was introduced as a model for localization in conservative systems .",
    "also we have benefit from several results on the standard map .",
    "this confirms the importance and generality of the chirikov standard map for the study of classical and quantum deterministic chaotic motion . since 30 years , generations of physicists all around the world , have learned the beauty and complexity of nonlinear dynamics on the base of this apparently simple map .",
    "we believe that the chirikov map is at the root of the impressive growth of the whole field of nonlinear dynamics and chaos . strangely enough",
    "this fundamental contribution of b.v .",
    "chirikov to one of the main achievements of physics of this century has never been properly recognized .",
    "several years ago , in a friendly private letter to a colleague concerning a paper in which he failed to give the necessary credit to chirikov , a common friend joseph ford , now deceased , wrote `` .. why not give to the old russian bear his due ? ''",
