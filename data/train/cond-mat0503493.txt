    "the pairing symmetry is very essential for uncovering the mechanism both for conventional and high-@xmath4 superconductivity .",
    "the recently discovered intermetallic perovskite @xmath0 superconductor@xcite is regarded as a bridge between conventional superconductors and high-@xmath4 cuprates , and the issue concerning its symmetry of order parameter has attracted considerable attention . however",
    ", pairing symmetry about @xmath0 remains highly controversial in reported literatures .",
    "nmr@xcite , specific heat@xcite , scanning tunneling measurement@xcite and point contact tunneling spectra@xcite favor the s - wave pairing in @xmath0 . on the other hand , the earlier theoretical calculation@xcite , the tunneling spectra@xcite and the penetration depth measurement@xcite support non - s - wave superconductivity .",
    "recently a two - band s - wave model has been proposed by w@xmath5lte _ _ et al.__@xcite who try to explain the complex behavior observed in @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the thermodynamic parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 of two @xmath0 samples by careful magnetization measurement .",
    "it is found that the normalized superfluid density , @xmath6 , can be described by bcs prediction for a s - wave pairing symmetry .",
    "therefore , our magnetization data support the conventional single band s - wave superconductivity in @xmath0 .    this paper is organized as follows : the samples and experimental details are presented in section ii . the data and discussions are given in section iii .",
    "and section iv gives the summary .",
    "the polycrystalline @xmath0 sample investigated here has been prepared by powder metallurgy method , and the details of preparation can be found elsewhere@xcite . the superconducting transition temperature is 6.9 k measured by both magnetization [ ac susceptibility ( @xmath7 hz , @xmath8 oe ) and dc diamagnetization shown in fig .",

    "the @xmath9 curves show a sharp transition with the transition width less than 0.5 k. the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) analysis presented in fig .",
    "1 ( b ) shows that all diffraction peaks are from the @xmath0 phase , which indicates that the sample is nearly of single phase .     measured by maglab with ac field 1 oe and frequency 333 hz .",

    "the demagnetization factor in this situation is almost negligible since the field has been applied along the axis of the cylinder .",
    "another sample ( denoted as @xmath10-@xmath12 ) has been polished to an ellipsoid with semi - major axis a=3.74 mm and semi - minor axis b=1.5 mm .",
    "the demagnetization factor for the ellipsoidal sample is @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "the magnetic fields have been applied parallel to the longitudinal axis of the samples .",
    "the magnetic measurements are mainly carried out on an oxford cryogenic maglab system ( maglab12exa , with temperature down to 1.5 @xmath15 ) and checked by a quantum design superconducting interference device ( squid , mpms 5.5 t ) .",
    "after zero - field cooled ( zfc ) from 25 k to a desired temperature , the magnetization curve @xmath16 is measured with the applied magnetic field swept slowly up to 1000 oe ( @xmath17 @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the magnet has been degaussed at t= 25 k in order to eliminate the remanent field before each measurement .",
    "it is essential to do degaussing since otherwise even 5 oe residual field may cause significant effect on the result of magnetization .",
    "in this section , the processes to obtain the superconducting parameters by magnetization measurement have been reported in detail for two @xmath0 samples , one is a cylinder and another is an ellipsoid .      the curves of dc magnetization are shown in fig .",
    "2 . the temperature varies between 1.57 k and 6.88 k with steps 0.2 k ( some 0.4 k ) .",
    "all curves show clearly the common linear dependence of the magnetization on field caused by meissner effect at low fields , and this extrapolated common line is the so - called meissner line ( ml ) .",
    "the optimal ml ( solid line in fig.2 ) is achieved by doing linear fit @xmath16 of the lowest temperature ( 1.57 k ) at low fields , which represents the magnetization curve of meissner state .",
    "the value of h@xmath18 is determined by examining the point of departure from linearity on the initial slope of the magnetization curve ( ml ) with a certain criterion .",
    "the results of subtracting this ml from magnetization curves are plotted in fig .",
    "3 and the @xmath19 between @xmath20 and @xmath21 emu are shown in the inset with an enlarged view .",
    "all curves show a fast drop to the resolution of device when the real @xmath1 is approached , so the value of h@xmath18 is easily obtained by choosing a proper criterion of @xmath22 m .",
    "the h@xmath23 acquired by using criteria of @xmath24 and @xmath25 emu are shown in fig .",

    "in addition , @xmath19 drops sharply with decreasing magnetic field , the use of lower @xmath19 value in our criterion will not result in a much different @xmath32 curve . if not specially mentioned , the discussion is based on the data using the criterion of @xmath38 emu hereinafter . at the temperatures below 2.8 k ( @xmath39 0.4 @xmath4 ) ,",
    "the values of @xmath32 and @xmath26 are almost constant despite the lack of the data below 1.5 k. this may imply the conventional s - wave nature in @xmath0 , because the finite energy gap manifests itself with an exponentially activated temperature dependence of thermodynamic parameters . this can be further confirmed in the following discussion on superfluid density .",
    "worthy of noting is that , it is very difficult to distinguish a slight difference of @xmath1 ( or 1/@xmath40 ) in low temperature region between different pairing symmetries , for example for an ideal s - wave , an exponential dependence is anticipated , for a dirty d - wave , a quadratic form @xmath41 is expected .",
    "here we use an alternative way , i.e , to fit the data in intermediate and high temperature region to extract useful message for pairing symmetry .    as we know , the total superfluid density @xmath42 is proportional to @xmath43 , and @xmath6 represents the normalized superfluid density . in fig . 5",
    ", we display the temperature dependence of @xmath6 of @xmath0 with @xmath44 as a fit parameter .",
    "the predictions of bcs s - wave ( dashed ) and two - fluid model ( dotted ) are also shown . according to the bcs theory for clean superconductors@xcite",
    ", the normalized superfluid density @xmath6 is expressed as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the bcs superconducting energy gap , @xmath47 $ ] is the fermi distribution function , and @xmath48 is the quasiparticle density of states . the most appropriate superconducting gap @xmath49 is chosen in our bcs calculation with @xmath50 , and this value is reasonable for @xmath0 because the generally reported results are larger than the conventional bcs value(@xmath51 ) . it is found that @xmath6 of @xmath0 can be well described by the s - wave bcs theory with a single gap , but the two - fluid model shows a substantial deviation .",
    "this suggests the s - wave nature of superconductivity in @xmath0 , which is consistent with our previous conclusion reached by point - contact - tunneling@xcite . later on",
    "we will show that our results are not compatible with any other pairing symmetry with nodes on the gap function which normally contributes a power law dependence to the temperature dependence @xmath42 .    for the sake of comparison , the temperature dependence of the normalized superfluid density in @xmath35 obtained by exactly the same magnetization method@xcite is also shown in fig .",
    "5 , with @xmath44 as a fit parameter . clearly the data can not be understood in isotropic s - wave bcs theory or two - fluid model because of the two - gap characteristic of @xmath35@xcite .",
    "the data obtained from this simple magnetization method on @xmath35 was found to be close to that determined by more elegant microwave method@xcite and radio frequency technique@xcite , which can be seen from fig .",
    "this indicates that the same magnetization method used in @xmath0 to get @xmath1 and @xmath2 is reliable , and the corresponding results are plausible .",
    "one may argue whether the @xmath1 obtained here is the lower critical field of grains because of the polycrystalline nature of our sample . in our magnetization experiment",
    ", the nominal @xmath52 of our sample is about 145.1 oe . combined with @xmath53 ( @xmath54 oe ) determined from our previous measurement of specific - heat@xcite , we can reach that the value of @xmath29 is 39 and @xmath55 equals to 2165 oe by eqs .",

    "this manifests that @xmath1 measured here reflects the bulk property .",
    "in addition , the value of @xmath59 for @xmath0 is quite large , so that the influence of the grain boundary is weak .",
    "another argument is that the nominal @xmath1 relation obtained in our experiment may not reflect the true @xmath1 but the flux entry field because of the bean - livingston surface barrier and effects of sample corners geometrical barriers .",
    "however , we would argue that the influence of surface barrier is not important to our cylindrical sample , since the magnetization hysteresis loops are very symmetric in the temperature and filed regimes we measured . in order to further verify the validity of this method to obtain @xmath1 ,",
