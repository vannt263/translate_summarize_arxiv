    "solitary waves propagating on the surface of fluids have been extensively studied since john scott russell discovered them in 1834 @xcite .",
    "they occur naturally in the form of tidal bores , but they can be generated in a laboratory as well .",
    "the most striking property of these solitary waves is their well - distinguished shape which they maintain during propagation ; they can travel extremely long distances without considerable dispersion or dissipation .    the first theory to successfully explain the existence of solitary waves",
    "was developed by korteweg and de vries @xcite .",
    "it is based on the shallow - water theory of ideal fluids , which predicts linear waves in the small amplitude limit ; these waves are slightly dispersive . however , nonlinearity is also present due to the convective term appearing in the euler equation .",
    "according to the korteweg@xmath0de vries ( kdv ) theory , solitary waves emerge as a balance between nonlinearity and dispersion .",
    "the shape of the waves and their propagation velocity can be obtained from the exactly solvable kdv equation .",
    "the kdv theory can be considered as a first - order approximation to solitary waves .",
    "although it explains their unusual properties and agrees well with experiments for small amplitude solitary waves , further refinements to the theory are possible . by using the systematic expansion method developed by friedrichs @xcite , the second - order approximation to the solitary waves was found by laitone @xcite .",
    "later on , fenton extended the method to nine orders @xcite , while schwartz reached the 70th - order approximation with the aid of computers @xcite .",
    "the derivations of the kdv equation or any higher order approximations are absent from many standard textbooks @xcite , while others giving more complete account on the topic use involved mathematical techniques @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present an alternative method for treating shallow - water solitary waves .",
    "this method is mathematically simpler and physically more intuitive ; it can be presented in any undergraduate course . based merely on the conditions of incompressibility and irrotational flow , we use bernoulli s law to obtain equations that describe the shape of solitary waves in the different order approximations mentioned above .",
    "the first two equations are solved to find approximate shapes and two expressions for the propagation velocities .",
    "we test the validity of these expressions by comparing them to large amplitude solitary waves in the laboratory , and find that the second - order approximation gives much better correlation with the experimental results .    ,",
    "let us consider a solitary wave propagating to the left along the @xmath1 direction with velocity @xmath2 in an unbounded fluid of ambient height @xmath3 . examining it from a co - moving system , the stationary flow described in figure [ figure1 ]",
    "is observed .",
    "the origin of the coordinate system is placed to the bottom of the fluid under the peak of the solitary wave .",
    "the horizontal ( @xmath4 ) and vertical ( @xmath5 ) components of the flow velocity are functions of the coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 , while @xmath8 denotes the excess fluid height compared to @xmath3 .",
    "the amplitude of the solitary wave is defined as the value @xmath9 . in the limiting case of @xmath10 ,",
    "it is obvious that @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    for many liquids , in particular water ,",
    "the effect of viscosity can be neglected , therefore the problem can be described by the euler equation .",
    "instead of trying to solve it directly , we first recite some important properties of the flow to be examined : first , water is practically incompressible , hence @xmath14 as a consequence , the density @xmath15 of the liquid is constant .",
    "it can be assumed by most wave phenomena that the flow is irrotational so that @xmath16 according to the standard boundary conditions , the vertical velocity must vanish at the bottom of the liquid : @xmath17 it is also clear that the material flux through the full depth must be the same for all vertical cross - sections taken at any @xmath6 .",
    "the constant value of this flux can be obtained by calculating it for the limiting case of @xmath18 such that @xmath19 the last important property of the flow is that the liquid pressure equals the pressure of air on the surface : @xmath20 finding a flow that satisfies conditions ( [ cond - div])@xmath0([cond - top ] ) is much easier than solving the euler equation directly .",
    "in this section , we present a method for obtaining an ordinary differential equation for @xmath8 in an iterative sequence of steps .",
    "let us first examine the flow with the velocity components @xmath21 it is clear that the conditions ( [ cond - rot])@xmath0([cond - rate ] ) are fulfilled ; however , the divergence of the velocity does not vanish . to satisfy condition ( [ cond - div ] ) ,",
    "we add a new term to the vertical velocity @xmath5 .",
    "the new term @xmath22 can be obtained by elementary methods : differentiation of @xmath4 with respect to the coordinate @xmath6 and integration with respect to the single variable @xmath7 .",
    "an arbitrary function of @xmath6 appears after the integration which can be chosen to fulfil condition ( [ cond - bottom ] ) .",
    "the new term obviously does not contribute to the flux , therefore the flow with these modified components satisfies conditions ( [ cond - div ] ) , ( [ cond - bottom ] ) and ( [ cond - rate ] ) .",
    "for the new flow , however , the rotation of the velocity does not disappear ; to satisfy condition ( [ cond - rot ] ) , we now add a new term @xmath23 to the horizontal velocity @xmath4 .",
    "the method for obtaining @xmath23 is nearly the same as above ; after the differentiation of @xmath5 with respect to @xmath6 and the integration with respect to @xmath7 an arbitrary function of @xmath6 appears .",
    "this can be chosen to make the flux resulting from the new term vanish .",
    "the vertical velocity at the bottom of the water obviously remains zero , hence the flow with the new term satisfies the conditions ( [ cond - rot])@xmath0([cond - rate ] ) .    , width=377 ]    at this point , the situation is formally the same as at the beginning : the divergence of the flow is non - zero again",
    ". it can be assumed , however , that after these steps we are closer to the exact flow solution .",
    "once again , a new term must be added to the vertical velocity and another one to the horizontal velocity as mentioned above . by following this iteration scheme and repeating the steps shown in figure [ figure2 ] ,",
    "we obtain infinitely long expressions for both components of the velocity . assuming that this method is convergent",
    ", the new terms become less and less significant .",
    "the remaining divergence and rotation after all the steps therefore approach zero and the limiting flow satisfies conditions ( [ cond - div])@xmath0([cond - rate ] ) .",
    "it is , however , still left to examine whether condition ( [ cond - top ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "since viscosity can be neglected and the flow is irrotational , bernoulli s law holds between two points of the water surface ; one of these points can be chosen to be infinitely far away , while the other is arbitrary with its horizontal coordinate @xmath6 : @xmath24}. \\label{eqn - bern1}\\ ] ] after rearranging this equation , both the air pressure @xmath25 and the density @xmath15 of water cancel out , hence we obtain @xmath26 this equation determines the shape @xmath8 of the surface .",
    "the velocity components are given by the infinitely long expressions obtained from the iteration scheme of figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "equation ( [ eqn - bern2 ] ) is thus an infinitely long ordinary differential equation , which is impossible to treat without approximations .",
    "by substituting in principle the infinitely long expressions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 into equation ( [ eqn - bern2 ] ) we obtain an equation containing an infinite number of complicated terms .",
    "these terms can , however , be expanded into series with respect to dimensionless quantities much less than unity . assuming a long solitary wave of small amplitude , these quantities are @xmath29 for example",
    ". the derivatives of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath6 are denoted by primes .",
    "after the expansion the equation is still infinitely long , but its terms are simpler and can more easily be classified . equation ( [ eqn - bern2 ] ) can formally be written as @xmath30 where all terms denoted by @xmath31 take the similar form : they are the products of the function @xmath8 and its different derivatives multiplied or divided by the appropriate power of @xmath3 to keep them dimensionless . some of the terms are nonlinear , while those containing derivatives are responsible for dispersion .",
    "examples of such terms are @xmath32 both nonlinearity and dispersion can occur in more complex terms , such as @xmath33 to estimate the magnitudes of these different terms , let us write the shape of the solitary wave as @xmath34 the new quantity @xmath35 is an effective wave number , which is inversely proportional to the horizontal extension of the solitary wave , while @xmath36 denotes an appropriately smooth unknown function of the dimensionless product @xmath37 .",
    "the magnitude of the derivatives of @xmath8 can be estimated via equation ( [ shape - gen ] ) .",
    "for example , the magnitudes of the terms in ( [ term - h1 ] ) are @xmath38 respectively .",
    "it is assumed that the amplitude @xmath39 is much smaller , while the length @xmath40 is much larger than the initial water height @xmath3 : @xmath41 which are equivalent to the relations in ( [ term - small1 ] ) .",
    "solitary waves emerge as a balance between nonlinearity and dispersion ; in the most simplistic case , it is enough to keep the largest nonlinear and the largest dispersive term .",
    "these are the terms in ( [ term - h1 ] ) , therefore in this case they must have the same order of magnitude : @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43 this relation determines the relative magnitudes of the small quantities in ( [ term - small2 ] ) . in the following section ,",
    "we derive the simplest approximation , which corresponds to a case where all terms @xmath31 in equation ( [ eqn - tn ] ) are neglected except for the terms in ( [ term - h1 ] ) .",
    "the solution can be checked to be in agreement with relation ( [ term - comp ] ) .",
    "it is natural to expect that the same relation also holds for the more accurate approximations since keeping smaller terms does not essentially change the order of magnitude relationships .",
    "in order to derive the approximate equations , let us return to equation ( [ comp - xy ] ) and implement the method described in the previous two sections .",
