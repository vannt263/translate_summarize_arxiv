    "magnetic field plays an important role in present - day star formation .",
    "observations indicate that molecular clouds have the magnetic field strengths of order @xmath11 g and magnetic energies comparable to the gravitational energies @xcite .",
    "these strong fields significantly affect star formation processes .",
    "for example , protostellar jets , which are ubiquitous phenomena in the star - forming region , is considered to be driven from the protostar by the lorentz force @xcite .",
    "the jet influences the gas accretion onto the protostar and disturbs the ambient medium .",
    "in addition , the angular momentum of the cloud is removed by the magnetic braking and protostellar jet .",
    "@xcite showed that , in his two dimensional mhd calculation , 99.9% of the angular momentum is transferred from the center of cloud by the magnetic field .",
    "this removal process of angular momentum makes the protostar formation possible in the parent cloud that has much larger specific angular momentum than that of the protostar . on the other hand , so far , magnetic effects in primordial gas clouds have been ignored in many studies because the magnetic field in the early universe is supposed to be extremely weak .",
    "however , recent studies indicate that moderate strength of magnetic fields exists even in the early universe .",
    "@xcite showed that cosmological fluctuations produce magnetic fields before the epoch of recombination .",
    "these fields are large enough to seed the magnetic fields in galaxies .",
    "@xcite proposed the generation mechanism of magnetic fields at the epoch of the reionization of the universe .",
    "they found that magnetic fields in the intergalactic matter are amplified up to @xmath12 .",
    "these fields can therefore increase up to @xmath13 in the first collapsed object having the number density @xmath14 .",
    "these fields may influence the evolution of primordial gas clouds and the formation of population iii stars .    under the spherical symmetry including the hydrodynamical radiative transfer , the star formation process are carefully investigated by many authors both in the present - day ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and primordial star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a significant difference between present - day and primordial star formation exists in the thermal evolution of the collapsing gas cloud because of difference in the abundance of dust grains and metals . in present - day star formation ,",
    "gas temperature in molecular clouds is @xmath15k .",
    "these clouds collapse isothermally with polytropic index @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) in @xmath18 , then the gas becomes adiabatic ( @xmath19 ) at @xmath20 , and an adiabatic core ( or the first core ) is formed , where @xmath21 denotes the central number density of the collapsing cloud .",
    "when the number density reaches @xmath22 , the molecular hydrogen is dissociated ( @xmath23 ) , and the cloud begins to collapse rapidly again . when the number density reaches @xmath24 , the equation of state becomes hard again ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the protostar is formed at @xmath26 . on the other hand ,",
    "primordial gas clouds have temperature of @xmath27k at @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "these clouds collapse keeping @xmath23 for a long range of @xmath29 .",
    "after the central density reaches @xmath22 , the thermal evolution in the primordial collapsing cloud begins to coincide with that in present - day cloud ( for detail , see fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the difference in thermal evolution between present - day and primordial clouds arises in the period of @xmath30 . in present - day star formation , two distinct flows ( molecular outflow and optical jet ) , which are frequently observed in star forming regions ,",
    "are driven by the respective core ; the outflow is driven by the adiabatic cores ( the first core ) and the jet is driven by the protostar @xcite .",
    "in addition , many numerical simulations have shown that fragmentation of the adiabatic core , and thus possible formation of binary or multiple stellar systems .",
    "in contrast , primordial protostars are formed directly without the prior formation of adiabatic core , because the thermal pressure smoothly increases keeping @xmath31 for @xmath30 .",
    "even when the primordial cloud is strongly magnetized , the wide - angle outflow which corresponds to the present - day molecular outflow ( that is driven from the adiabatic core formed at @xmath20 ) may not appear , but the well - collimated jet ( that is driven from the protostar ) is ejected at @xmath32 . in addition , it is expected that , in the collapsing primordial cloud , fragmentation rarely occurs for @xmath30 , because the cloud continues to collapse and the perturbation inducing fragmentation can not grow sufficiently .    another major difference between",

    "@xcite also showed that ionization fraction is high enough for the magnetic field to couple with the gas even in the accretion phase after the protostar is formed . in summary , the magnetic field is largely dissipated by the ohmic dissipation before the protostar formation in present - day cloud , while the magnetic field can continue to be amplified without dissipation in primordial cloud .",

    ", the magnetic field strongly suppresses the rotation driven fragmentation @xcite .",
    "for the primordial cloud , effects of the magnetic field on fragmentation are still unknown .    in this paper , we investigate the evolution of weakly magnetized primordial clouds and formation of population iii stars using three - dimensional mhd simulations , and show the driving condition of a jet from proto - population iii stars and the fragmentation condition in the collapsing primordial cloud cores .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig:5 ] , the jet supplies gas above and below the disk , and the density becomes higher there for the jet models , while these region remains less dense for the non - jet models .",
    "the jet models are distributed in the lower right region in figure  [ fig:5 ] , indicating that a jet is driven in strongly magnetized but slowly rotating cloud .",
    "it should be also noted that the non - jet models coincide with the fragmentation models except for models 31 and 32 . in other words , almost all the clouds experience either jet formation or fragmentation . in the fragmentation models ,",
    "the angular momentum of the parent cloud is distributed to both the orbital and spin angular momenta of the fragments , and fragmentation therefore reduces the spin angular momentum of the protostar .",
    "this deficiency of the spin angular momentum of the fragments suppresses jet formation .",
    "firstly , to investigate the relation between jet and magnetic field strength , we focus on models in the fourth row ( models 27 - 30 ) . in model 27 , which has a weakest magnetic field @xmath131 g ( or @xmath171 ) at the initial stage , no jet appears because of fragmentation . in model 28 ,",
    "the protostar manages to drive the jet , while the initial cloud has a considerably small magnetic energy ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "when the cloud has a weak magnetic field , a jet is considered to be driven by the magnetic pressure gradient force , not by the disk wind mechanism .",
    "the jet structure in model 28 is similar to the magnetic bubble as reproduced by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite shows that when the magnetic field around the central object is extremely weak ( @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the plasma beta ) , the magnetic field is amplified by the spin of the central object , and the magnetic pressure drives a jet .",
    "a prominent jet is reproduced in model 29 , in which the jet is considered to be driven mainly by the disk wind mechanism .",
    "the jet in model 30 is weaker than that in model 29 in spite of the stronger initial field strength ; the jet in model 30 has slower average speed and smaller mass ejection rate than those in model 29 .",
    "the weakness of the jet in model 30 is attributed to the strong magnetic braking , which slows down the spin of the cloud before the protostar formation in model 30 .",
    "in fact , the protostar has an angular velocity of @xmath175s@xmath8 in model 29 while @xmath176s@xmath8 in model 30 at the protostar formation epoch .",
    "the protostar therefore rotates @xmath15 times faster in model 29 than that in model 30 .",
    "in addition , the growth rate of the angular velocity in the collapsing cloud is smaller in strongly magnetized cloud ( see  [ sec : dis - ang - mag ] ) . in models 27 - 30 , the jet in model 29 has highest speed and largest jet momentum flux at the end of the calculation . as a result ,",
    "moderate strength of the magnetic field is necessary to drive strong jet from the protostar .",
    "next , to investigate dependence on rotation , we focus on the models in the third column in figure  [ fig:5 ] ( models 11 , 17 , 23 , 29 , and 35 ) . in these models ,",
    "the most prominent jet appears in model 23 , while weak jets appear both in slowly ( model 35 ) and rapidly rotating clouds ( model 11 ) .",
    "the weakness of the jet in model 35 is due to deficiency of rotation to drive a strong jet , and that in model 11 is due to a low amplification of the magnetic field during the collapse ; amplification of the magnetic field is related to the rotation , and spin - up is also related to the magnetic field strength as discussed in  [ sec : dis - ang - mag ] .",
    "therefore , a moderate rotation speed as well as a moderate magnetic field strength is necessary to drive a strong jet . in summary",
    ", a jet appears in models distributed in the lower right region ( i.e. , models with stronger magnetic field and slower rotation ) , and models showing strong jets are limited in the range of @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "since we calculated the evolution of the jets only for short duration ( @xmath179a few 10 days ) for numerical limitation , we can not estimate the momentum of a jet , mass ejection speed and final speed of jet in long - term evolution .",
    "in addition , strength of a jet may largely change in further long - term evolution .",
    "we do not discuss the further evolution of a jet ( c.f .",
    ", final jet speed , mass ejection rate , etc .. ) , because our purpose in this paper is to investigate the condition for driving jet in primordial collapsing clouds .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] shows a configuration of magnetic field lines ( black - white streamlines ) and a structure of a jet ( transparent red iso - velocity surface ) for each models .    in the jet models , the magnetic field lines are twisted inside the jet region .",
    "almost axisymmetric jets are seen in models 18 , 23 , 24 , 28 , 29 , 34 , and 35 .",
    "these jets have the hourglass - like configurations of the magnetic field lines , where the poloidal component is more dominant than the toroidal component as shown in figure  [ fig:1]_f _ and [ fig:2]_c_. these configurations of the magnetic field lines can easily drive a jet by the disk wind mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "non - axisymmetric jets are seen in models 17 , 30 , and 36 .",
    "they are caused by the non - axisymmetric density distribution at the protostar formation epoch .",
    "such a non - axisymmetric density distribution is also reflected by non - axisymmetric circumstellar disks , represented by a red iso - density surface in figure  [ fig:6 ] .",
    "for example , model 30 exhibits the non - axisymmetric jet ( transparent red iso - velocity surface ) driven from the bar - like density distribution ( red iso - density velocity surface ) at the root of the jet .    in the fragmentation models ,",
    "the configurations of the magnetic field lines are disturbed , and the toroidal field tends to be more dominant than the poloidal filed as shown in models 16 and 22 in figure  [ fig:6 ] and also in figure  [ fig:3]_f_. these configurations of the magnetic field lines indicate weakness of the field strength , which is insufficient to drive a jet .",
    "the weak poloidal field is attributed to the oblique shocks on the surface of the disk envelope , and the disturbance of the field lines are attributed to the orbital motion of the fragments and the spin of the fragments .",
    "the spin of the fragment winds the magnetic fields around its rotation axis , and the field strength is amplified . in the further stages ,",
    "the magnetic pressure may drive a jet .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] shows the evolution track of the central magnetic field strength ( @xmath138-axis ) and central angular velocity ( @xmath139-axis ) from the initial state for some models .",
    "the @xmath138-axis indicates @xmath180 , which corresponds to the pressure ratio of @xmath181 at the center , where @xmath182 and @xmath183 denote the central magnetic pressure and the central thermal pressure .",

    "this variable also coincide with the energy ratio of @xmath189 at the center if assuming a uniform sphere . hereafter",
    "this variable is called the normalized angular velocity .",
    "the asterisks at the ends of the loci denote the initial values of normalized magnetic fields and normalize angular velocities .",
    "the diamonds on the loci denote the stages of @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , and these values are labeled for the loci of models 2 , 9 , 21 , 23 , 33 , and 35 .",
    "the arrows on the loci indicate the directions of the cloud evolutions .    the normalized magnetic fields and angular velocities increase as the central density increases except for stages of very high density in all the models . for comparison ,",
    "a relationship of @xmath194 is plotted with the solid line at the lower right corner of figure  [ fig:7 ] , and all the model evolves in the direction almost parallel to this line .",
    "this implies that both of the normalized magnetic fields and the normalized angular velocities are amplified during the early phase of the collapse at the almost same growth rate . as indicated by @xcite , the central magnetic field and angular velocity increase as , @xmath195 during the nearly spherical collapse phase that corresponds to figure  [ fig:1]_a_[fig:1]_d_. the relationship of the angular velocity in equation  ( [ eq : solid ] )",

    "the difference between the power indexes is attributed to the equation of state in the primordial gas , @xmath198 .",
    "the polytropic index @xmath199 is assumed as a function of density , and it is approximated to @xmath200 for @xmath201 ( see fig.1 of @xcite ) . adopting the relation of @xmath202 , the equation ( [ eq : bz ] ) is obtained . the slightly larger power index in the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : bz ] ) is reflected in the slope of loci slightly steeper than that of equation ( [ eq : solid ] ) .",
    "the relationships of equations ( [ eq : omega ] ) and ( [ eq : bz ] ) are examined in detail in  [ sec : dis - spherical - collapse ] .",
    "the slope of loci also indicates that the magnetic braking is ineffective during the spherical collapse phase .",
    "if magnetic braking is effective ( i.e. , it slows down the spin of a cloud ) , increase in the angular velocity was less than that indicated by equation ( [ eq : omega ] ) , and the slope of the loci would be shallower .",
    "we confirmed that the magnetic braking become prominent only after the protostar formation .",
    "in other words , the magnetic field is not amplified enough to affects the evolution of the cloud during the spherical collapse of the early phase . in the later phase ,",
    "the cloud center exhibits transition from nearly spherical collapse to the disk - like collapse because of rapid rotation and/or strong magnetic field , which are amplified in the nearly spherical collapse phase , and the evolutionary track stagnated in the hatched band of figure  [ fig:7 ] .",

    "figure  [ fig:8 ] shows the evolution of the normalized angular velocity in models 3 , 9 , 15 , 21 , 27 , and 33 , which are located in the third column of figure  [ fig:4 ] and have the common weak magnetic field @xmath203 g and different angular velocities @xmath204s@xmath8 at the initial stage ( see table  [ table ] )",

    "the cloud in model 3 can not collapse spherically because the cloud has a large rotational energy at the initial stage .",

    "the upper panel indicates the power law amplification of @xmath209 ( equation  [ [ eq : mag - omega ] ] ) except in the high - density phase and therefore the spherical collapse of the clouds for all models .",
    "figure  [ fig:9 ] lower panel also shows the evolution of the magnetic field in terms of the @xmath210 .",
    "all the curves indicate the power law amplification of @xmath211 , corresponding to equation  ( [ eq : bz ] ) .",
    "the curves in the lower panel undulate more than those in the upper panel because of the undulation in the pressure included in the normalization .",
    "however , the curves in the lower panel converges well to @xmath212 at the high density phase compared with those in the upper panel . as a result , when the cloud collapses spherically ( i.e. , early evolution phase ) , the evolution of the angular velocity and magnetic field are well expressed by equation  ( [ eq : mag - omega ] ) , and the normalized variables are also expressed by equations  ( [ eq : omega ] ) and ( [ eq : bz ] ) .",
    "as the cloud collapses , the normalized angular velocities converge to @xmath213 in figure  [ fig:8 ] , and the normalized magnetic fields converge to @xmath214 with initially strong magnetic fields ( models 34 , 35 , and 36 ) in figure  [ fig:9 ] lower panel .",
    "figures  [ fig:8 ] and [ fig:9 ] present only limited models .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:7 ] where more models are plotted , the normalized magnetic field and the normalized angular velocity converge to the so - called flux - spin relation , @xmath215 this relation is represented by the gray band in figure  [ fig:7 ] . if an initial stage is located in lower and left - side of the gray band in figure  [ fig:7 ] , a points indicated by the two normalized variables moves in the upper right direction according to equations ( [ eq : omega ] ) and ( [ eq : bz ] ) in the nearly spherical collapse phase . when the point reaches the gray band of equation ( [ eq : bw ] ) , the cloud changes the geometry of collapse from a sphere to a disk .",
    "after the transition , the point remains around the gray band with small oscillation .",
    "the numerical factors in equation ( [ eq : bw ] ) are determined empirically .",
    "the horizontal gray band corresponds to the convergence value in figure  [ fig:8 ] [ @xmath216 , and the vertical gray band corresponds to the convergence value in figure  [ fig:8 ] lower panel [ @xmath217 .",
    "the convergence value of the angular velocity was found by @xcite , and that of magnetic field was found by @xcite , for isothermal clouds modeling the present - day star formation .",
    "while they considered either rotation or magnetic field , @xcite considered both the rotation and magnetic field , and obtained the convergence values for rotation and magnetic field ( flux - spin relation ) for the present - day star formation .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : bw ] ) is an extension of flux - spin relation of @xcite to the primordial star formation .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] indicates that the magnetic field strengths and angular velocities converge to the flux - spin relation represented by equation  ( [ eq : bw ] ) even in the primordial magnetized clouds .",
    "the length of the locus before the convergence to the spin - flux relation depends on the initial magnetic field strength and the initial angular velocity . figures  [ fig:8 ] and [ fig:9 ] show that models having stronger magnetic field and/or more rapid rotation at the initial state converge to the spin - flux relation in the earlier evolutionary phase ( or lower density phase ) .",
    "in other words , a model initially located near the gray band converges earlier .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig:7 ] , the evolutionary track of model 9 reaches gray band at @xmath218 , while that of model 21 reaches the gray band at @xmath219 .",
    "this is because the initial normalized angular velocity in model 9 is stronger than that in model 21 ( models 9 and 21 have the same strengths of the magnetic field at the initial ) . in order to confirm the relation of equations  ( [ eq : omega ] ) and ( [ eq : bz ] ) in figure  [ fig:7 ] , we focus on the evolutionary track for model 33 , which has @xmath220 and @xmath221 at the initial stage .",
    "the evolutionary track in model 33 reaches gray band at @xmath222 , that is @xmath223 times higher than the initial density . according to equations  ( [ eq : omega ] ) and ( [ eq : bz ] )",
    ", the normalized angular velocity and magnetic field should be amplified by factors of 464 and 83.2 respectively . on the other hand , the model 33 exhibits @xmath224 and @xmath225 when the evolutionary track reaches gray band , and the amplification factors are therefore 364 and 71.4 , which are consistent with that derived from equations  ( [ eq : omega ] ) and ( [ eq : bz ] ) .    when an evolutionary track converges to the flux - spin relations , the central cloud deforms from a sphere to a disk because the central angular velocity and/or magnetic field have been amplified during the nearly spherical collapse phase .",
    "for example , model 23 , shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] , produces a thin disk at @xmath219 , at which the evolutionary track converges to the gray band in figure  [ fig:7 ] .",
    "after evolutionary track converges to the flux - spin relation , it oscillates around the flux - spin relation as shown in figures  [ fig:7 ] .",
    "we also noticed that the strong accretion shocks are generated on the surfaces of the disk when the model converges to the flux - spin relation .",
    "the shock generation is also related to the oscillation of the evolutionary track after the convergence .",
    "when the evolutionary track oscillates around the flux - spin relation , a new shock is generated inside the collapsing disk intermittently .",
    "the intermittent shock generation results in a nested structure of the shocks .",
    "such nested shocks are first reproduced in the simulation of collapse of a rotating isothermal disk by @xcite .",
    "the convergence and oscillation is also seen in figures  [ fig:8 ] and [ fig:9 ] .",
    "the convergence indicates a power law amplification of angular velocity and magnetic field during the disk - like collapse phase . in the case of homologous collapse of an isothermal disk with a thin disk approximation ,",
    "this power law amplification is expressed as @xmath226 @xcite .",
    "for the polytropic gas , the growth rate is modified as @xmath227 .",
    "the normalized variables are also modified as @xmath228 and @xmath229 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in our case of @xmath200 , the normalized angular velocity would increase slightly in proportion to @xmath230 , and such a small increase is hardly seen in figures  [ fig:7 ] and [ fig:8 ] because of the significant amplitude of the oscillation .",
    "all the models examined in this paper exhibit convergence to the flux - spin relation of equation  ( [ eq : bw ] ) as shown in figure  [ fig:7 ] . a convergence point within the flux - spin relation",
    "depends on the initial angular velocity and the initial magnetic field , and the convergence point characterizes the fate of a cloud . a model with initially fast",
    "rotation and weak magnetic field starts its evolutionary track at a point in the upper left region , and the evolutionary track converges to the horizontal gray band .",
    "such a model is called `` the rotation - dominated model . '' on the other hand , a model with initial slow rotation and strong magnetic field starts its evolutionary track at a point in the lower right region of figure  [ fig:7 ] , and the evolutionary track converges to the vertical gray band .",
    "such a model is called `` magnetically - dominated model . ''",
    "we classified all the models into the rotation ( @xmath231 ) and magnetic ( @xmath232 ) dominated models and summarized it in the last column of table  [ table ] .    only the rotation - dominated models exhibit fragmentation because the rotation is amplified enough to promote fragmentation and magnetic braking is insufficient to prevent fragmentation . @xcite examined fragmentation of non - magnetized primordial clouds , and showed that fragmentation occurs in the case where the normalized angular velocity at the center converges to @xmath233 before the protostar formation .",
    "a magnetically - dominated model never converges to equation  ( [ eq : fcri ] ) because the evolutionary track never reaches the horizontal band in figure  [ fig:7 ] .",
    "a rotation - dominated model is satisfied with equation  ( [ eq : fcri ] ) when the initial normalized angular velocity is @xmath234 where @xmath235 denotes an upper - bound of density where the equation state is approximated by the polytrope with @xmath200 , and @xmath236 denote the initial central density .",
    "we used the relationship of @xmath206 when equation  ( [ eq : fcri2 ] ) is derived . examining the initial conditions of the rotation - dominated models , all the rotation - dominated models except for models 31 , 32 , and 33 satisfies equation  ( [ eq : fcri2 ] ) , and these models exhibit fragmentation , consistently with the fragmentation condition .",
    "the fragmentation condition of equation  ( [ eq : fcri ] ) is therefore valid even for magnetized primordial clouds .",
    "the fragmentation condition can be rewritten in terms of the rotational energy .",
    "assuming that the center of the cloud undergoes homologous collapse with rigid rotation , the parameter @xmath237 is expressed as @xmath238 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : fcri ] ) therefore indicates that fragmentation occurs when the rotational energy reaches @xmath239% of the gravitational energy owing to spinning up of the cloud center .",
    "all the magnetically - dominated models presented here show the jet formation .",
    "the condition for jet formation coincides with the flux - spin relation of the magnetic - dominated models , @xmath240 when the central magnetic field is amplified up to the level of equation  ( [ eq : out - cond ] ) before the protostar formation , a jet appears just after a protostar is formed .",
    "this condition is expressed as , @xmath241 using the power law amplification of the magnetic field during the spherical collapse ( eq . [",
    "[ eq : bz ] ] ) . examining the initial conditions of the magnetically - dominated models , they are satisfied with equation  ( [ eq : out - cond2 ] ) except for model 34 , although the evolutionary track of model 34 converges to the point satisfying equation  ( [ eq : out - cond ] ) .",
    "this exceptional feature of model 34 is attributed to the slightly steeper slope in the lower panel of figure  [ fig:8 ] than that of the reference line , @xmath242 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : out - cond ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath243 since @xmath244 .",
    "this indicate that a jet is driven by the protostar when the magnetic field is amplified and the plasma beta reaches @xmath245 before the protostar formation .",
    "the equation  ( [ eq : out - cond ] ) can not be realized in rapidly rotating clouds , because the evolutionary track converges to horizontal gray band in figure  [ fig:7 ] and never reach the vertical band .    although the magnetically and rotation dominated models are separated clearly , some models are located on the border between the categories present mixed features . model 11 and 17",
    "are located near the border between the rotational and magnetic dominated models , and exhibit both fragmentation and jet . in these models , fragments merge to form a single core after fragmentation , while other fragmentation model does not show merger until the end of the calculation . after the merger ,",
    "the jet begins to be driven from the merged core .    in the fragmentation models ,",
    "we do not observe a jet driven from either fragment .",
    "this indicates that fragmentation occurs in rotation dominated models where the magnetic field is too weak to drive the jet .",
    "however , it may be possible that the magnetic field amplified by the spin of the protostars drive the jet in the further stage .",
    "we conclude that the condition of equation  ( [ eq : out - cond ] ) is valid for the jet which is formed within a few times 10 days after the protostar formation .      in our calculation",
    ", both the normalized angular velocity and normalized magnetic field are bounded by values expressed by equations  ( [ eq : fcri ] ) and ( [ eq : out - cond ] ) ( i.e. , gray band in fig .  [ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "therefore , given a central density , the maximum angular velocity and magnetic field strength are expressed as , @xmath246 and @xmath247 when the protostar is formed at @xmath248 , which is @xmath249 times larger than @xmath250 , the protostar has a maximum angular velocity of @xmath251 which corresponds to the rotation period of @xmath252days .",
    "the maximum magnetic field strength is given by , @xmath253 at the protostar formation epoch ( @xmath254 ) , where the thermal pressure adopted in our calculation is used .",
    "we measure the magnetic field strengths ( @xmath255 ) and angular velocities ( @xmath256 ) at the protostar formation epoch for every models , and the measured values are listed in 7th and 8th column of table  [ table ] . for the models with parenthesis , we can not follow the cloud evolution by the protostar formation epoch because fragmentation occurs in relatively early phases . for these models ,",
    "the magnetic field and angular velocity just before fragmentation are listed . as listed in table  [ table ] , the protostars at their formation epoch have the angular velocities in the range of @xmath257 , which corresponds to the rotation periods of @xmath258 .",

    "the magnetic fields are ranged in @xmath259 , which are also bounded by the value of equation  ( [ eq : bps ] ) .",
    "the observations indicate that the present - day protostar have magnetic fields of @xmath260 kg at the maximum @xcite . according to our simulations , population",
    "iii protostars can possess 10 times stronger magnetic field than protostars at present day .",
    "the smallness of the magnetic field in the present day protostars is attributed to the magnetic dissipation during the protostellar collapse .",
    "@xcite studied collapse of magnetized clouds for the present - day star formation , and showed that the magnetic fields of the protostar is @xmath179 kg at the maximum because the magnetic field is largely dissipated by the ohmic dissipation in the late phase of collapse , @xmath261 ( see also , @xcite ) . on the other hand , the dissipation of the magnetic field is not supposed to be effective in primordial collapsing clouds as shown in @xcite .",
    "population iii stars therefore possess stronger magnetic field than that in present day if they are formed via the process of the magnetically - dominated models .",
    "the magnetic fields and angular velocities of the protostar listed in table  [ table ] are the values at the moment of the protostar formation , in which the mass of protostars is only @xmath262 .",
    "since stars acquire a large fraction of mass in a subsequent accretion phase , the magnetic field strength and angular velocity may be changed in further evolution .",
    "the angular momentum is transferred by magnetic interaction between the protostar and circumstellar disk .",
    "the magnetic field can be amplified by convection inside the protostar . however , since the purpose of this paper is to investigate the magnetic effect in collapsing primordial clouds , we do not discuss subsequent evolution of the magnetic field and angular velocity .",
    "to determine the magnetic field and angular velocity of population iii stars , further long - term calculations is necessary including a model of stellar evolution .",
    "in this paper , we calculated cloud evolution from the stage of @xmath263 until the protostar is formed ( @xmath264 ) for 36 models , parameterizing the initial magnetic field strength and the initial rotation , to investigate effects of magnetic fields in collapsing primordial clouds . in figure  [ fig:10 ] ,",

    "the solid line clearly separates the models ; fragmentation occurs but no jet appears when @xmath266 , and jet appears after without fragmentation when @xmath267 .",
    "in addition , the solid lines almost coincide with the boundary between the rotation - dominated model and the magnetically dominated models ( see table  [ table ] for which category each model falls into ) . as a result , in the collapsing primordial cloud",
    ", the cloud evolution is mainly controlled by the centrifugal force than the lorentz force when @xmath266 , while the lorenz force is more dominant than the centrifugal force when @xmath268 .",

    "they can be scalable at any initial density as @xmath269 , assuming the spherical collapse , which is approximated well in the early phase .",
    "a jet is driven when the initial cloud has magnetic field of @xmath270 g if the cloud rotates slowly as @xmath271s@xmath8 .",
    "this condition corresponds to that in @xcite and is also consistent with the condition of equation  ( [ eq : out - cond2 ] ) .",
    "a strong jet is expected in primordial star formation .",
    "the power of a jet , e.g. , a mass ejection rate , is considered to be controlled by the accretion rate as indicated in present - day star formation ; the mass ejection rate of a jet is 1/10 of the mass accretion onto the protostar .",
    "the accretion rate of primordial star formation is expected to be considerably larger than that at present day , and it produces a stronger jet .",
    "the life time of the jet also seems to be controlled by accretion in the present - day ; a jet stops when mass accretion stops . for population iii stars , the gas accretion does not halt within their lifetimes @xcite .",
    "therefore , a jet also may continue during the all lifetime of the protostar , and the strong jet propagates to disturb a surrounding medium significantly .",
    "the disturbance of the medium could trigger the subsequent star formation as frequently observed in present - day star formation .    assuming the power law growth of @xmath272 , the critical strength of the magnetic field , @xmath273 g at @xmath274 corresponds to @xmath275 g at @xmath276 , which is much stronger than the background magnetic field of @xmath277 g derived by @xcite .",
    "however , when the magnetic field is amplified to @xmath278 g by some mechanisms , the magnetic field can affect the collapse of the primordial cloud .",
    "even if a cloud has a magnetic field weaker than the critical strength @xmath273 g , the magnetic field may play an important role after the protostar formation .",
    "@xcite studies analytically the evolution of accretion disks around the first stars , suggesting that magnetic fields amplified in the circumstellar disk eventually give rise to protostellar jets during the protostellar accretion phase .",
    "rotation promotes fragmentation when the first collapsed objects has the angular velocity of @xmath279s@xmath8 as shown in figure  [ fig:10 ]",
    ". this condition coincides with that given by equation  ( [ eq : fcri2 ] ) .",
    "the fragmentation is expected to produces binary or multiple stellar system .",
    "when a multiple stellar system is formed , some stars can be ejected by close encounters . at the protostar formation epoch , the protostar has a mass of @xmath280 .",
    "the ejected proto - population iii stars may evolve to metal - free brown dwarfs or low - mass stars .",
    "when a binary component in a multiple stellar system is ejected from the parent cloud by protostellar interaction , a low - mass metal free binary may also be appeared in the early universe .",
    "@xcite indicates that the extremely metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath281 - 5 ) stars @xcite discovered recently are formed as binary members from metal - free gas , and then have been polluted by the companion stars during the stellar evolution .",
    "@xcite shows that a binary frequency in population iii star is comparable to or larger than that at present day . in order to confirm the ejection scenario ,",
