    "this paper addresses a question asked to the first author by masanori morishita , on the possibility of adapting to @xmath0-manifolds the bost  connes construction @xcite of a quantum statistical mechanical system associated to the abelian extensions of @xmath1 , and its generalizations to number fields @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , along the lines of the general  arithmetic topology \" program .",
    "the latter can be seen as a broad dictionary of analogies between the geometry of knots and @xmath0-manifolds and the arithmetic of number fields , with knots as analogs of primes and @xmath0-manifolds , seen as branched coverings of the @xmath0-sphere , viewed as analogs of number fields . in this paper",
    "we answer morishita s question by providing explicit constructions of quantum statistical mechanical systems associated to ( alternating ) knots , to knot groups , and to cyclic branched covers of the @xmath0-sphere , with the latter providing our analog of the abelian extensions of @xmath1 in the bost  connes construction .",
    "the structure of the resulting quantum statistical mechanical systems is different from the bost  connes case and it leads to an algebra of observables that can be expressed in the form of a bernoulli crossed product , of the type studied in noncommutative bernoulli actions in the theory of factors .",
    "we relate the geometry and dynamics of our system to known invariants of knots and @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "arithmetic topology originates from insights by john tate and michael artin on topological interpretations of class field theory .",
    "the analogy between primes and knots , which is the founding principle of arithmetic topology , was first observed by barry mazur , david mumford , and yuri manin .",
    "the subject developed over the years , with various contributions , such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , as a powerful guiding principle outlining parallel results and analogies between the arithmetic of number fields and the topology of @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "the basic analogy sees number fields as analogs of compact oriented @xmath0-manifolds , with @xmath1 playing the role of the @xmath0-sphere @xmath2 . here",
    "the main idea is that , while number fields are finite extensions of @xmath1 , ramified at a finite set of primes , all compact oriented @xmath0-manifolds can be described as branched coverings of the @xmath0-sphere , branched along a link . a major point where this analogy does not carry over",
    "is the fact that , while the description of a number field as ramified covering of @xmath1 is unique , there are many inequivalent ways of describing @xmath0-manifolds as branched covers of the @xmath0-sphere , branched along knots or links ( or more generally embedded graph ) .",
    "while this lack of uniqueness for @xmath0-manifolds can be used to make the construction dynamical , see @xcite , the same dynamics does not apply to number fields .",
    "however , the corresponding analogy between knots and primes , that results from this first analogy between number fields and @xmath0-manifolds , has been very fruitful , leading to many new results , ranging from arithmetic analogs for higher linking numbers @xcite , @xcite , to arithmetic chern  simons theory , @xcite .    over the past two decades ,",
    "the connection between number theory and quantum statistical mechanics was also widely explored , starting with early constructions of statistical systems associated to the primes , @xcite , @xcite , the more refined bost ",
    "connes system @xcite which also involves the galois theory of abelian extensions of @xmath1 , and subsequent generalizations of this construction to arbutrary number fields , obtained in @xcite and further studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to recast the bost  connes construction in the setting of arithmetic topology , with the semigroup of knots with the connecting sum operation replacing the multiplicative semigroup of positive integers , and the cyclic branched coverings of the @xmath0-spheres replacing the abelian coverings of @xmath1 .",
    "we recall briefly the construction of the bost  connes algebra and quantum statistical mechanical system from @xcite ( see also @xcite and  3 of @xcite ) . consider the group ring @xmath3 $ ] with generators @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "the maps @xmath6 given by @xmath7 determine an action of the semigroup @xmath8 by endomorphisms of the group ring @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "these endomorphisms have partial inverses @xmath9 \\to \\q[\\q/\\z]$ ] , @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 an idempotent in @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "thus , one can define the semigroup crossed product .",
    "this is the ( rational ) bost  connes algebra @xmath14\\rtimes \\n$ ] with generators @xmath15 and @xmath4 and relations @xmath16 @xmath17 the complexification @xmath18 has a @xmath19-algebra completion given by the semigroup crossed product @xmath20 , with the same generators and relations .",
    "the time evolution of the bost  connes system is defined by @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the algebra @xmath23 has representations on the hilbert space @xmath24 , parameterized by the choice of an element @xmath25 , of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a root of unity in @xmath28 determined by the embedding of @xmath29 specified by the choice of @xmath25 , where we identify @xmath30 .",
    "given a pair @xmath31 of a @xmath19-algebra and a time evolution @xmath32 , a kms@xmath33 state for @xmath31 is a continuous linear functional @xmath34 satisfying normalization @xmath35 and positivity @xmath36 ( that is , a _ state _ on @xmath37 ) such that , for all @xmath38 there is a function @xmath39 that is holomorphic on the strip @xmath40 and continuous on the boundary @xmath41 of the strip , such that @xmath42 in other words , the failure of a kms@xmath33 to be a trace is measured by interpolation by a holomorphic function .",
    "the kms states of the bost  connes system @xmath43 are completely classified and given by the following list of cases ( see @xcite ) :    * for every @xmath44 there is a unique kms@xmath33 state @xmath45 determined by @xmath46 where @xmath47 , with @xmath48 the mbius function ; * for every @xmath49 , the extremal kms@xmath33 states are given by gibbs states determined by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the polylogarithm function , @xmath27 is a root of unity , for a given @xmath25 , and @xmath52 is the riemann zeta function ; * for @xmath53 the extremal kms@xmath33 states are determined by @xmath54 .    the bost  connes system is related to the arithmetic of @xmath1 and the galois theory of its abelian extensions .",
    "generalizations of this quantum statistical mechanical system were constructed for arbitrary number fields in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and further studied in @xcite , @xcite .      in  [ qsmknotssec ]",
    "we develop a quantum statistical mechanics of knots .",
    "there is a natural semigroup structure on knots .",
    "it is given by the operation of connected sum defined on equivalence classes of _ oriented knots_. this operation gives rise to an abelian semigroup @xmath55 , which is infinitely generated , with generators the prime knots .",
    "each knot has a unique prime decomposition @xmath56 for some @xmath57 , with @xmath58 prime knots .",
    "we focus on knot invariants that behave well with respect to the connected sum operation .",
    "in particular , we focus on simple invariants such as the genus and the crossing number . in the latter case , it is at present an open conjecture whether the invariant is additive over connected sums for all knots , but the result is known to hold for alternating knots .",
    "therefore , in the paper we often restrict our attention to alternating knots , purely for the purposes of using these results about the crossing number . conditionally to the above mentioned conjecture , one can reformulate them in terms of the larger semigroup of knots .",
    "we construct a hamiltonian based on genus and crossing number and we estimate in theorem  [ zetacrg ] the range of convergence of the partition function using results of @xcite , @xcite on the rate of growth of multiplicities .",
    "we show the uniqueness of kms states for this system of knots without interaction in proposition  [ kmska ] and we discuss the type iii nature of the high temperature state in proposition  [ kmska ] and theorem  [ iiiq ] .",
    "in  [ intersec ] we return to the original system without interaction of @xcite and @xcite , with prime numbers contributing independent oscillators ( in the form of toeplitz operators ) and we discuss how one can try to extend it from the multiplicative semigroup @xmath8 of positive integer to the group @xmath59 of positive rational numbers .",
    "we show that the hamiltonian can be extended so that the corresponding partition function is again expressible in terms of the riemann zeta function .",
    "we show in  [ semikgroupgsec ] that the same construction extends to the case of the grothendieck group of the semigroup of ( alternating ) knots with the connected sum .",
    "again , this result relies on estimates of @xcite , @xcite on the number of alternating knots with fixed genus and crossing number .",
    "however , at the level of the algebra of observables of the system , this generalization of the hamiltonian requires an extension of the algebra by the spectral projections of the hamiltonian , in order to remain invariant under the time evolution .",
    "this extension has the effect of making the time evolution inner , which is not desirable from the operator algebra perspective .",
    "we bypass this problem by considering more general systems with interaction involving both knots and @xmath0-manifolds .    in  [ 3mfldsec ] , we introduce cyclic branched coverings of @xmath2 , branched along a knot .",
    "we discuss the behavior of knot groups under connected sums of knots , and we construct a directed system of knot groups over the semigroup of knots ordered by  divisibility \" with respect to the connected sum operation .",
    "we interpret the resulting direct limit as the knot group of a wild knot .",
    "we also consider a projective limit , related to changing the order of the cyclic branched cover .    in  [ 3mfldqsmsec ] we construct a more refined system , which is more similar in nature to the bost  connes system and which involves not only knots but also the cyclic branched covers of @xmath2 .",
    "we begin by investigating the action of the semigroup of knots with connected sum on the group algebra of the direct limit of the system of knot groups considered in the previous section .",
    "we show that , unlike the bost ",
    "connes case , the endomorphisms @xmath60 are injective and not surjective .",
    "the resulting crossed product system is then more similar to the generalization of the bost ",
    "connes considered in @xcite , in relation to the habiro ring . in particular , we show that the resulting crossed product algebra is in fact a noncommutative bernoulli shift @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the grothendieck group of the semigroup of knots @xmath55 and @xmath63 is the direct limit of the system of knot groups .",
    "the action of @xmath62 is the bernoulli action that permutes the terms in the crossed product @xmath64 .",
    "we then include the datum of the branched covers , in the form of a group homomorphism @xmath65 .",
    "we construct a projective limit of groups @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which correspond to adding @xmath68-th roots of the generators of the knot group .",
    "this construction is modelled on the construction of roots of tate motives in @xcite .",
    "this construction allows us to replace the algebra @xmath69 , which encodes the information about the knot groups , but not about the coverings , with the more refined @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the projective limit of the system of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 is a subsemigroup of @xmath8 , given by those integers that are relatively prime to @xmath74 , which is the order of the root of unity that is the image under the morphism @xmath75 of the generators of the group @xmath76 .",
    "the semigroup action of @xmath73 on @xmath77 is modeled on the bost  connes action , by viewing @xmath71 as a fibered product inside @xmath78 .",
    "we then construct time evolutions , first on the algebra @xmath70 , induced by the bost ",
    "connes time evolution on @xmath79 , and then on the tensor product @xmath80 , with @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in this tensor product case",
    ", we take on each factor a version @xmath83 of the bost ",
    "connes time evolution , with the hamiltonian @xmath84 scaled by a factor @xmath85 , for a function @xmath86 . in proposition",
    "[ zetasigmag ] , we identify a summability condition on the function @xmath85 that guarantees that the hamiltonian has a well defined partition function , which is convergent for @xmath87 . here",
    "the trace of the operator @xmath88 in the partition function is a combination of the operator trace on @xmath89 and the von neumann trace on the group algebra of @xmath71 .",
    "we also show how the kms states of the bost ",
    "connes determine kms states for the system @xmath90 .",
    "in particular the low temperature states give rise to kms states @xmath91 for this system that are gibbs states with respect to the partition function and the trace described in proposition  [ zetasigmag ] .",
    "we then consider the crossed product @xmath92 and we show that the kms states @xmath91 transform , under the action @xmath93 of @xmath94 as @xmath95 .",
    "restricting to the subsemigroup @xmath96 of alternating knots , we show that the same estimates of @xcite , @xcite on the number of alternating knots with fixed genus and crossing number that we used in ",
    "[ semikgroupgsec ] , and the result of theorem  [ zetacrg ] , imply that a function satisfying the desired convergence properties can be constructed using the crossing number and the genus of knots .",
    "consider the semigroup @xmath97 or ambient isotopy classes of oriented knots with the connected sum operation .",
    "the primary decomposition of knots states that every @xmath98 can be decomposed into a direct sum of prime knots .",
    "there are infinitely many prime knots , hence the semigroup @xmath99 is a countably generated free abelian semigroup .",
    "a choice of an enumeration of the prime knots gives a ( non - canonical ) semigroup isomorphism of @xmath55 with @xmath100 by mapping prime knots to the prime numbers .",
    "the identification is non - canonical as prime knots , unlike prime numbers , have no natural ordering .",
    "however , this identification suggests that the quantum statistical mechanics of creation - annihilation operators constructed out of the primary decomposition in @xmath8 ( see @xcite , @xcite , and  2 of @xcite ) can be directly adapted to the semigroup of knots .",
    "let @xmath101 denote the set of prime knots .",
    "as in the case of the semigroup @xmath8 , we can identify @xmath102 with the bosonic fock space @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the @xmath68-th symmetric power of a hilbert space @xmath105 , see  2 of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19-algebra @xmath106 is generated by isometries @xmath107 , for @xmath108 , with @xmath109 , and such that , for @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "the @xmath19-algebra @xmath106 is an infinite tensor product of toeplitz algebras @xmath112 .",
    "let @xmath113 be a knot invariant that behaves multiplicatively under connected sums , @xmath114 .",
    "any such invariant determines a semigroup homomorphism @xmath115 .",
    "[ zknotinvprod ] the alexander polynomial @xmath116 $ ] of a knot @xmath117 is multiplicative under connected sums .",
    "thus , for instance , setting @xmath118 to be the absolute value of the coefficient of the top degree term of @xmath119 provides an example of such a semigroup homomorphism @xmath113 .",
    "simpler examples can be obtained by considering additive invariants .",
    "let @xmath120 be a non - negative integer invariant of knots satisfying @xmath121 .",
    "for a choice of a positive integer @xmath122 ( for example , @xmath123 ) , the invariant @xmath124 satisfies the multiplicative property as above .",
    "[ addinv ] _ there are several examples of knot invariants with values in non - negative integers that behave additively under connected sums : for example , the knot genus @xmath125 satisfy additivity @xmath126 . _",
    "a more interesting example is the crossing number @xmath127 , the minimum number of crossings over all planar diagrams @xmath128 . while it is clear that @xmath129 , it is an open conjecture that the crossing number is in fact additive , @xmath130 .",
    "it is known that additivity is satisfied for alternating knots @xcite , and for certain classes of knots , like connected sums of torus knots .",
    "a larger class of knots on which additivity is satisfied is identified in @xcite .",
    "thus , we can either use @xmath127 on the entire semigroup @xmath99 , conditionally , or restrict to a subsemigroup @xmath96 of alternating knots , or @xmath131 generated by those prime knots that are torus knots , or one corresponding to the subclass of @xcite .",
