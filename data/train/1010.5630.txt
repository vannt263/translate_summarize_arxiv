    "the old concept of multiband / multigap superconductivity @xcite has found its strong experimental evidence only recently in the rich physics of magnesium diboride @xcite .",
    "consequently more superconductors are ( re)considered along this line .",
    "one of the important examples are the iron pnictides , a new class of high-@xmath8 superconductors @xcite for which multigap superconductivity is suggested to lead to an exotic pairing mechanism with a sign reversal of the order parameter between separated fermi - surface sheets .",
    "a revision in dichalcogenides brings more and more signatures of a distribution of superconducting energy gaps , which can be either due to different gaps on different fermi - surface sheets or anisotropic single gap .",
    "transition - metal dichalcogenides 2h - mx@xmath9 ( m = nb , ta , x = s , se ) are materials with layered structure .",
    "nb or ta atoms are trigonally prismatic coordinated by chalcogen atoms and metallic layers are held together by weak van der waals forces .",
    "because of this layered structure , electrical , magnetic , and optical properties show a high degree of anisotropy .",
    "nbs@xmath9 is the only member of the 2h - mx@xmath9 family , which does not undergo a charge - density wave transition @xcite .",
    "this could be a reason for its strong anisotropy , much larger than that of nbse@xmath0 .",
    "nbse@xmath9 had been considered for a long time as being a conventional type ii superconductor @xcite .",
    "later on , effects of the anisotropic and strong coupling interactions were taken into account @xcite .",
    "recent measurements sensitive to the order parameter show evidence that more than one energy scale is necessary to account for establishing superconductivity @xcite .",
    "nbs@xmath9 was also originally considered as just another anisotropic superconductor and its unusual specific heat dependence was not interpreted in detail @xcite .",
    "an important breakthrough came with scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm ) measurements by guillamn et al .",
    "@xcite , showing strong indications for two superconducting energy gaps instead of a single anisotropic one . since stm is a surface probe , this strong statement certainly needs independent support showing that the two gaps are reflecting the bulk properties of the system . in this paper",
    "we address this issue with bulk thermodynamic measurements of the specific heat at temperatures down to 0.6 k and in magnetic fields up to 14 tesla via ac - calorimetry technique .",
    "we find that the electronic specific heat @xmath2 can not be described by the standard bcs model with a single isotropic energy gap .",
    "first , at the lowest temperatures the data shows that quasiparticles are excited over an energy gap much smaller than the bcs weak coupling limit . the overall temperature dependence of @xmath2 can be described only if two gaps or an anisotropic one gap case is considered .",
    "second , the field dependence of the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath3 shows a strong curvature in striking similarity with that of nbse@xmath0 and mgb@xmath0 .",
    "however , the anisotropy of @xmath3 decreases with magnetic field in an opposite manner compared to the latter system .",
    "finally , the two gap scenario is supported by the absence of in - plane gap anisotropy in recent stm imaging of the vortex lattice in nbs@xmath0 @xcite , and by the fact that the numerical values of the two gaps obtained from fitting our data , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are also in a very good agreement with the stm data .",
    "details of the synthesis of the single crystalline samples can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the crystals used for the specific heat measurements come from the same batch as those used in the previous stm studies @xcite .",
    "their chemical composition was checked using an energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) .",
    "single crystals were also confirmed to be of 2h polytype by x - ray diffraction measurements . in our experiment a thin crystal with a well defined hexagonal shape and dimensions 500x500x30 @xmath12 m was chosen .",
    "specific heat measurements have been performed using an ac technique as described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the high sensitivity of this technique is not only very well adapted to measure the specific heat of very small samples but also to carry continuous measurements during temperature or magnetic field sweeps .",
    "we were thus able to obtain the field dependence of the electronic part of @xmath13 at @xmath14 k which only differs from its zero temperature limit , the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath3 , by about 2@xmath15 .",
    "measurements were performed with the magnetic field aligned along the two main crystallographic orientations , i.e. parallel and perpendicular to the basal @xmath16 plane of the sample .",
    "the temperature oscillations of the sample were recorded by a thermocouple calibrated in magnetic field using measurements on ultrapure silicon .",
    "we performed measurements at temperatures down to 0.6 k and in magnetic fields up to 8 t in the @xmath17he and @xmath18he refrigerators in koice .",
    "supplementary measurements up to 14 tesla and down to 2 k were performed in grenoble .",
    "figure 1 displays the temperature dependence of the specific heat of the sample ( plus addenda ) in selected magnetic fields up to 8 t for @xmath19 and up to 3 t for @xmath4 .",
    "the thermodynamic superconducting transition temperature at zero field was determined from the local entropy balance around the phase transition giving @xmath20 6.05 k. the zero - field anomaly at the transition is sharp ( @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 @xmath24 0.4 k ) indicating the high quality and homogeneity of the sample .",
    "the position of the specific - heat jumps are gradually shifted toward lower temperatures for increasing magnetic field . despite a significant broadening at high fields ,",
    "the anomaly remains well resolved at all fields .",
    "a field of 3 tesla applied along the c - axis was sufficient to completely suppress superconductivity in all the temperature range .",
    "on the other hand , 8 tesla applied along the ab - planes shifts the superconducting anomaly down to only about 3 - 4k underlying the strong anisotropy of this system .",
    "later we extended the measurements down to 0.6 k in a @xmath17he fridge where the specific heat was measured at zero field and at @xmath25 t. in the case of a very small crystal like ours , it is difficult to evaluate the exact total contribution of the addenda . the electronic part of the total specific heat value can be obtained by extrapolation of @xmath26 for t approaching zero .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath27 of @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the electronic heat capacity of the sample in the normal state . to avoid any fitting procedures , the addenda and the phononic contributions",
    "have been eliminated by subtracting the data taken at @xmath25 t from all the other runs .",
    "thus , the electronic specific heat of the sample , @xmath30 , normalized to its normal state value , @xmath29 , can be obtained experimentally by : @xmath31 , where @xmath32t@xmath33 and @xmath28 = @xmath34t@xmath35 .",
    "the result is presented in fig . 2 by the open circles .",
    "the only assumption in this procedure is the absence of magnetic field dependence of the addenda .",
    "this has been previously verified in numerous experiments using the same thermocouple wires and also confirmed here independently by the entropy conservation required for a second order phase transition , proving the thermodynamic consistency of the data and its treatment .",
    "we first compare the electronic specific heat with the isotropic single gap ( isg ) bcs model . the dashed line in fig .",
    "2 presents the isg bcs specific heat ( weak coupling of 2@xmath36 ) .",
    "one can see that while the height of the jump at @xmath8 of the experimental data is quite well reproduced , a significant deviation occurs at lower temperatures .",
    "the discrepancy between the bcs curve and the measured data represents 18 @xmath15 ( 7 @xmath37 ) of the total signal at 1.4k ( 4k ) , which is significantly larger than the error bars of our measurements .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "2 displays the logarithm of the electronic specific heat versus @xmath38 .",
    "as shown , one obtains an exponential dependence @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath41 is significantly lower than the value expected for the bcs weak coupling limit in the temperature range @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to coupling ratio 2@xmath21/@xmath43 2.3 that is much smaller than the isg bcs value of 3.52 , indicating that the quasiparticles are activated over a small energy gap .",
    "this fact as well as the overall shape of the specific heat temperature dependence resembles the case of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "a phenomenological @xmath44-model of the specific heat accounting for independent contributions from two bands with two different energy gaps has been successfully applied in the case of mgb@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the small gap 2@xmath45 and of the large gap 2@xmath46 at @xmath47 are fitting parameters of the model .",
    "the third parameter is the relative fraction of the density of states of the two bands @xmath48 . the full line in fig .",
    "2 represents a fit to the experimental data yielding the following parameters : 2@xmath49 2.1 @xmath500.05 , 2@xmath51 4.6@xmath500.2 , and @xmath48 = 0.67@xmath50 0.15 .",
    "the value of the small gap is close to the one evaluated from the exponential decay shown in the inset of fig .",
    "2 . importantly , both gap values are in striking agreement with those found in the stm experiment @xcite confirming that the latter are characteristic of the bulk .    as previously shown by huang et al .",
    "@xcite , the temperature dependence of the specific heat of nbse@xmath0 , another two - gap superconductor , can also be described by an anisotropic @xmath7-wave model , where the gap anisotropy is supposed to be in the form of @xmath52 corresponding to the hexagonal in - plane symmetry .",
    "here , @xmath53 is the average gap value and @xmath44 denotes its anisotropy , yielding @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this model with parameters @xmath56 and 2@xmath57 fits our data as well as the two gap scenario , @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath58 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 .",
    "we remark that the anisotropic gap should leave its footprint in the anisotropic vortex core @xmath65 as it is proportional to the related fermi velocity @xmath66 divided by the gap at zero temperature @xmath67 .",
    "however , in contrast to nbse@xmath0 , for which sts images revealed a sixfold star shape of the vortex cores , the fully isotropic vortices have been imaged in nbs@xmath0 @xcite questioning the applicability of the anisotropic single gap model in our case .",
    "we have measured thoroughly the evolution of the specific heat in the mixed state . at @xmath68",
    "k the electronic specific heat term @xmath69 is very close to the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath3 . its field dependence is displayed in fig . 3a and 3b for both principal field orientations .",
    "our maximum field available at this temperature range ( 8 tesla ) was not sufficient to reach the normal state for @xmath19 , but it was well above the upper critical field value of 2.4@xmath500.1 tesla for @xmath4 .",
    "3a emphasizes the strong non - linearity of @xmath70 when @xmath71 is applied perpendicular to the @xmath16 plane .",
    "again , such a non - linearity could be associated with the existence of 2 gaps or a single anisotropic one .",
    "the increase of @xmath3 with magnetic field is mainly due to the quasiparticle contribution inside the vortex cores . in the case of superconductor with a single isotropic gap ,",
    "@xmath3 should increase linearly in small magnetic field and a small nonlinearity in @xmath70 appears above the field where flux lines start overlapping . according to the calculations of nakai et al .",
    "@xcite , much stronger non - linearity of @xmath70 is achieved in case of anisotropic - gap superconductors . the full line in the fig .",
    "3a displays the field dependence of the normalized density of states @xmath72 ( proportional to the sommerfeld coefficient ) calculated by nakai et al . for the anisotropic gap with @xmath73 .",
    "the model qualitatively reproduces the behavior in our data ( open circles ) , but fails to describe the fast increase of @xmath3(h ) at low fields .",
    "this is evident in the inset of fig .",
    "3a where the derivative @xmath74 , i.e. the slope of @xmath75 for @xmath73 ( line ) and the slope of measured sommerfeld coefficient @xmath76 ( open circles ) are compared .",
    "this discrepancy makes the explanation of the specific heat data by the anisotropic gap scenario rather inconsistent .",
    "the observed @xmath70 behavior resembles the two - gap case of mgb@xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "3c , left curve ) @xcite , where the initial rapid increase of @xmath70 due to dominant role of the @xmath77 band with the small gap changes at fields where the @xmath78 band with the large gap comes into play .",
    "next , we compare the behavior of the sommerfeld coefficients in magnetic fields applied parallel and perpendicular to the basal planes of the both materials , nbs@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "3b ) and mgb@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "the latter is taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "following the procedure introduced by bouquet et al . in ref.@xcite",
    "an effective anisotropy @xmath79 can be obtained from these @xmath70 dependences .",
    "it is defined as the ratio of the magnetic fields in the @xmath16 plane and along the @xmath6 axis yielding the same @xmath3 value in fig .",
    "3b and fig .",
    "@xmath79 is plotted in fig 4a for both compounds as a function of the field @xmath4 normalized to its upper critical field value @xmath80 . as discussed already in the work of bouquet et al .",
    "on mgb@xmath0 @xcite the choice of the abscissa is arbitrary .",
    "we chose @xmath4 , but we could plot @xmath79 versus @xmath19 or versus @xmath70 as well . note that this @xmath79 tends towards the usual anisotropy of h@xmath81 , @xmath82 when @xmath83 at large magnetic fields . in mgb@xmath0 at low fields ( @xmath84 ) , the @xmath70 curves for the two principal directions are practically identical which gives @xmath85 as shown in fig .",
    "4a . at larger fields , @xmath79 increases reflecting a reduced contribution from the isotropic @xmath77-band , reaching @xmath86 which is the anisotropy of the dominant @xmath78-band @xcite . in nbs@xmath0",
    ", one observes an opposite field dependence of @xmath79 which starts from a highly anisotropic value @xmath87 at low fields and decreases to @xmath88 at our maximum field .",
    "a field dependent superconducting anisotropy is a typical signature of multigap superconductivity where a role of bands with different gaps can significantly vary with magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in contrast to mgb@xmath0 case , in nbs@xmath0 both bands would be anisotropic , as suggested by analogy with nbse@xmath0 in which band structure calculations @xcite show mostly 4 fermi surface sheets derived from nb @xmath89-bands forming warped cylinders along the @xmath6 axis , centered on the @xmath90 and @xmath91 points in the brillouin zone .",
    "moreover , two sheets derived from the bonding nb @xmath89 band are significantly more warped than the two derived from the antibonding nb @xmath89 band .",
    "different warping of nb sheets can naturally lead to a different level of anisotropy in each band .",
    "thus , a qualitatively different behavior of @xmath92 compared to mgb@xmath0 can be expected .    finally , we inspected the upper critical magnetic fields for both principal orientations of magnetic field .",
    "5 summarizes the values of @xmath71@xmath81 derived from the temperature - sweep measurements of the specific heat shown in fig .",
    "1 , as well as from field - sweep measurements . two sets of field - sweeps were performed , one in 14 tesla magnet for @xmath19 in a temperature range down to 2 k , and another one taken in the @xmath93 cryostat down to 0.6 k in the 8 tesla coil .",
    "as stated above , we determined @xmath8 at zero field from the local entropy balance around the anomaly .",
    "however , at finite fields this definition is not very practical for establishing @xmath94 , or @xmath95 . in order to reduce the uncertainty of the @xmath96 value arising from the broadening of the transition particularly at lower temperatures ( higher fields ) , we inspected the temperature shift between two neighboring curves in fig .",
    "1 . a similar procedure was used to determine @xmath96 from field - sweep measurements .",
    "the resulting temperature dependence of @xmath96 is shown in fig . 5 for both @xmath97 and @xmath4 .",
    "importantly , the three independent sets of temperature and field - sweeps measurements yield consistent results with a nice overlap . both temperature dependencies",
    "show a slight positive curvature for temperatures @xmath98 .",
    "the upper critical field in the @xmath16 plane reveals very high values with @xmath99 slope of about 3 tesla / k , close to the pauli paramagnetic limit .",
    "the temperature dependence of the superconducting anisotropy @xmath90 calculated as a ratio @xmath71@xmath100 of the upper critical fields is displayed in fig . 4b together with the results obtained in mgb@xmath0 @xcite . as shown , in contrast to mgb@xmath0 ,",
    "the resulting anisotropy @xmath90 is close to 7 and approximatively constant for @xmath101 .",
    "note that this value might be slightly underestimated in case of a small misalignement of the crystal for @xmath102 .",
    "our results are consistent with those obtained by onabe et al .",
    "@xcite from resistive measurements in a field up to 2 tesla .",
    "the strong decrease of @xmath90 in mgb@xmath0 close to @xmath8 is a direct consequence of the existence of the isotropic @xmath77- band .",
    "this is not a general feature of multiband superconductivity since @xmath103 results from a subtle balance between the fermi velocities and the relative weight in the dos of the different bands @xcite .",
    "these precise calculations are still to be carried out in the case of nbs@xmath0 .",
    "analysis of the zero - field specific heat data has shown that : ( 1 ) the zero - field electronic term of the specific heat can not be described by an isotropic single - gap bcs formula , but it is compatible with the two - gap @xmath44 model ; ( 2 ) the large ( small ) gap is 2@xmath104 4.6 ( 2@xmath105 2.1 ) .",
    "the measurements in the mixed state have supported the two - gap scenario revealing : ( 3 ) a strongly non - linear @xmath106 ; ( 4 ) a field - dependent superconducting anisotropy . even if some of these features of the specific heat could be eventually explained by an extremely anisotropic - gap superconducting model",
    ", this would not be compatible with the observation of two well - resolved gap features with sizes of 2@xmath107 2 and 4 , respectively , and also with the absence of in - plane anisotropy in the vortex lattice images by the scanning - tunneling spectroscopy of guillamn et al . to conclude ,",
    "our bulk thermodynamic measurements are in full agreement with stm spectra , supporting that nbs@xmath0 is another case of well resolved two - gap superconductor .",
