    "the properties of non - relativistic many - body quantum systems , as arise in many branches of physics , are described by the schrdinger equation .",
    "unfortunately , the schrdinger equation can be solved exactly in but a few exceptional cases , either involving one - dimensional or symmetry - restricted hamiltonians or for systems with very few particles . for almost all problems ,",
    "reliable approximate solutions must be sought .",
    "many methods of approximately solving the schrdinger equation for many - body quantum systems have been developed , often tailored to the specific system or problem under investigation .",
    "especially challenging has been to come up with methods that can treat large numbers of particles with great accuracy , particularly in the vicinity of a phase transition .",
    "a major breakthrough was the development of the numerical renormalization group ( rg ) method by wilson @xcite in the mid-1980s , which provided for the first time an efficient strategy for solving the kondo problem @xcite .",
    "the enormous power of the rg method immediately suggested its application to quantum lattices .",
    "it soon became clear , however , that the wilson rg method ran into difficulties when dealing with such systems .",
    "the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) was introduced by white in 1992 @xcite in an effort to overcome the limitations of wilson s rg in describing one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum lattice models .",
    "the new method was soon shown to be extremely powerful , producing results for the ground state energy of the s=1 heisenberg chain that were accurate to twelve significant figures @xcite , well beyond the precision of large - scale diagonalization methods combined with finite size corrections or of monte carlo techniques .",
    "the dmrg is an approximate variational procedure that is rooted in wilson s _ onion picture _ @xcite . in the context of quantum lattices ,",
    "the idea is to start with a set of lattice sites and then to iteratively add to it subsequent sites until all have been treated . at each iteration ,",
    "the dimension of the enlarged space increases as the product of the dimension of the initial subspace and that of the added site .",
    "the renormalization group procedure consists of reducing the enlarged space to the same dimension as the initial subspace and then transforming all operators to this new truncated basis ( renormalization ) .",
    "one of the key features that distinguishes the dmrg from wilson s rg is the criterion by which the truncation is implemented .",
    "while the wilson rg retains the lowest hamiltonian eigenstates of the enlarged space , the dmrg uses a very different strategy .",
    "here the idea is to construct the reduced density matrix for the enlarged space in the presence of a medium that approximates the rest of the hilbert space , then to diagonalize this density matrix , and finally to maintain only those states with the largest density matrix eigenvalues .",
    "this method of truncation is guaranteed to be optimal in the sense that it maximizes the overlap of the approximate ( truncated ) wave function with the wave function prior to truncation .    following the ideas just described",
    ", one can treat the entire set of  onion \" layers . depending on the manner in which correlations between layers fall off and in the choice of the order in which layers are treated",
    ", this can sometimes lead to an accurate representation of the ground state of the system .",
    "usually , it does not , however , since the early layers know nothing of the physics of those treated subsequently .",
    "this suggests the use of a  sweeping \" algorithm , whereby once all layers have been sampled , we simply reverse direction and update them based on the information of the previous  sweep \"",
    ". such a sweeping algorithm can be iteratively implemented until acceptable convergence in the results has been achieved .",
    "the real - space dmrg ( rdmrg ) , as described above , has been applied extensively and with enormous success to many 1d systems @xcite , such as spin chains and ladders @xcite , t - j @xcite and hubbard models @xcite , models with disorder @xcite , models with impurities @xcite , polymers @xcite , and the kondo model @xcite .",
    "extension of the method to 2d lattices @xcite requires establishing a path that covers all of the sites of the lattice .",
    "since there are many possible paths through a 2d lattice , it is critical that the path chosen conform to the dominant correlations of the problem .",
    "electrons in small square or rectangular lattices with t - j or hubbard hamiltonians @xcite have been treated using this dmrg strategy , though with much less precision than for 1d systems .",
    "problems in 3d are beyond the scope of the dmrg in real space .    a pedagogical introduction to the real space dmrg method together with a summary of some of its most important applications can be found in the proceedings of the workshop  density - matrix renormalization \" @xcite held in dresden in september 1998 .    since then , there have been many important developments and advances of the dmrg , which has opened up the possibility of its application to finite fermi systems . these new developments originated with the introduction of a transformation of the dmrg from real space to momentum space ( kdmrg ) .",
    "the kdmrg method was first discussed by xiang @xcite and applied to the hubbard model in 2d .",
    "the results were not very encouraging , however , and the method was therefore not pursued at that time for other 2d quantum lattices .",
    "this method was recovered in a slightly modified form in 1999 in an effort to build a dmrg methodology appropriate to problems in quantum chemistry @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the momentum basis was replaced by a basis of single - particle orbitals , so as to better accommodate the dynamics of the problem .",
    "the first applications were reported in refs .",
    "several other applications to problems in quantum chemistry were subsequently reported @xcite .",
    "a somewhat different extension of the dmrg methodology was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the context of a study of ultrasmall superconducting grains . in that work ,",
    "a modification of the algorithm  called the particle - hole dmrg ( phdmrg )  was proposed in order to optimally account for the crucial correlations close to the fermi energy .",
    "the method was shown to work extremely well for superconducting grains up to very large dimensions .",
    "the phdmrg was then introduced for possible application in large - scale nuclear shell - model calculations @xcite .",
    "several other important applications of the extended methodology have also been reported recently , including applications to electrons in the lowest three landau levels @xcite .",
    "the dmrg methodology , both in real space and in the versions appropriate to finite fermi systems , usually violates some symmetries of the underlying hamiltonian .",
    "while this is not critical when studying certain features of the associated quantum systems , it may be critical when dealing with others .",
    "there have been some recent efforts to modify the dmrg algorithm @xcite to permit the preservation of symmetries throughout the iterative truncation process .    in this review , we summarize the rapid progress now being made on the dmrg methodology and the wide variety of important applications that have been reported recently for strongly correlated finite fermi systems .",
    "we begin in section ii with an historical overview of the method and review its application in real space to quantum lattices . in the same section , we describe the basic features of the kdmrg extension and discuss its application to quantum lattices in more than one dimension . in section iii , we begin our focus on finite fermi systems , discussing the modifications to the general dmrg algorithm needed in such cases and reviewing the applications to date . then in section iv we discuss the issue of symmetry restoration , summarizing recent developments and describing in some detail how this new machinery can be used in the context of angular momentum restoration . in section v",
    ", we close the presentation by providing some perspectives for future applications of the dmrg approach in finite fermi systems .",
    "a quantum many - body problem is completely defined by giving a basis of one - body states , a hamiltonian operator and the number of particles .",
    "usually , the one - body states are obtained from a self - consistent mean - field calculation , such as hartree - fock ( hf ) , or by some optimized orbital basis . in atomic and molecular physics",
    "@xcite , for example , the electrons move in the attractive coulomb field generated by the atomic nucleus .",
    "the residual electron - electron interaction can be taken into account in mean field to give a set single - electron energy states , which then can serve as the starting basis . in nuclear physics @xcite ,",
    "the nucleon - nucleon mean field generates a set of self - consistent single - nucleon levels , which can provide the basis .",
    "alternatively , we can ignore detailed self - consistency and choose a basis for convenience .",
    "convenient single - nucleon bases used frequently in nuclear physics include the eigenstates of a harmonic oscillator potential ( all localized ) and the eigenstates of a woods - saxon potential ( both localized and continuum states ) .",
    "though the main goal of this review is to present the latest developments using the dmrg method in such finite fermi systems , we will begin with an historical overview , starting with the development of the method for quantum lattices and its applications in that domain . here",
    ", the single - particle basis state is replaced by a single active electron level , located at a given site in real space .",
    "one of the most well - known models of strongly interacting electrons on a lattice is the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "it describes the hopping of electrons between nearest neighbor sites ( atoms ) subject to a repulsive coulomb interaction between them when they occupy the same site .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hubbard model takes the form    @xmath0    the operator @xmath1 creates ( annihilates ) an electron on site @xmath2 with spin projection @xmath3 .",
    "the first term represents the hopping of electrons with intensity @xmath4 .",
    "the strength of the on - site coulomb repulsion is @xmath5 and @xmath6 denotes the number operator for an electron on site @xmath2 with spin projection @xmath7 .    assuming that we have a system with @xmath8 sites , the exact solution of the problem amounts to constructing the many - body basis of states in the appropriate hilbert space , calculating the matrix elements of the hamiltonian in this basis and then diagonalizing . in the hubbard model ,",
    "each site admits precisely four states , as it can be empty , it can contain an electron with spin up , it can contain an electron with spin down , or it can be fully occupied by two electrons .",
    "thus , the dimension of the fock space is naively @xmath9 , growing exponentially with the number of sites . because of conservation of symmetries in the many - body basis , _",
    "e.g. _ total particle number , total spin , total momentum , etc .",
    ", the hamiltonian matrix separates into blocks , each with reduced dimension . nevertheless , the order of magnitude of each block dimension is still comparable to the full fock space dimension and thus likewise grows exponentially with the number of lattice sites . for this reason ,",
    "exact large - scale diagonalization using the lanczos or davidson algorithms is only feasible for a small number of sites .",
    "the largest reported exact diagonalization of the hubbard model , for example , was for a 4@xmath104 2d lattice .",
    "exact diagonalization , combined with finite size extrapolation , has proven very useful when trying to understand the gross features of several lattice models .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to do better , by being able to treat larger systems . obviously , if we want to treat larger systems we have to implement an efficient truncation strategy , one that permits an accurate description of the low - energy properties of the system while only keeping a reasonably small part of the full hilbert space .    in the finite fermi systems that arise in quantum chemistry ( qc ) and in nuclear structure ( ns ) , similar issues",
    "arise as regards the size of the hilbert space and the need for an efficient truncation strategy . in those fields , a variety of methods",
    "have been developed and used with great success in the study of small systems , such as simple molecules and light nuclei . in qc , for example , the configuration interaction ( ci ) method @xcite working in a hf basis with a limited set of particle - hole states can be used to build a truncated many - body hilbert space in which to diagonalize the hamiltonian and obtain approximate solutions of the schrdinger equation . in ns , the shell model ( sm )",
    "@xcite starts with a nuclear mean field generated by the average interaction of one nucleon with all the others . for simplicity , the mean field",
    "is often modelled by a harmonic oscillator potential with a spin - orbit coupling , defining a set of shells well separated in energy .",
    "the nuclear interaction expressed in this basis is typically diagonalized for a given nucleus within one major shell for each type of nucleon . despite the enormous truncation inherent in both the ci approach in qc and the sm approach in ns , the methods are limited as to the systems that can be treated accurately . in ns , for example ,",
    "_ exact _ shell - model diagonalization techniques can not be applied to nuclei beyond the @xmath11 shell , leaving outside the scope of detailed shell - model microscopy most medium - mass and heavy nuclei .",
    "going beyond the limits of exact diagonalization techniques , even within the restricted bases just described , requires a new kind of truncation strategy .",
    "one that has been used with great success in many systems is the monte carlo approach .",
    "another is the renormalization group ( rg ) approach @xcite , the subject of this review . in this method ,",
    "a set of renormalization transformations that gradually grow the size of the system while keeping the dimension of the configuration space constant is introduced .",
    "the procedure is implemented iteratively . at each step , the system is grown by the addition of new degrees of freedom .",
    "the enlarged system is then truncated to the same size as before , and a renormalization is implemented which transforms the hamiltonian and all other relevant operators to the truncated space .",
    "the numerical renormalization group of wilson represented a breakthrough in the application of rg ideas to a non - trivial strongly correlated system , the single - impurity kondo problem @xcite . later on",
    "it became clear that the wilson rg ( wrg ) could not be applied to other strongly correlated lattice problems @xcite , for reasons that we will discuss below .",
    "nevertheless , the method and its failure provide the basis for the development of the dmrg .      in this subsection",
    ", we briefly describe the numerical renormalization group of wilson for a generic one - dimensional lattice . while we will have in mind for concreteness the hubbard hamiltonian ( [ hub ] ) ,",
    "the formalism we will describe is general enough to incorporate other one - dimensional lattice models , including the kondo problem .",
    "in fact , wilson first formulated his numerical rg after mapping the kondo problem onto a 1d lattice in energy space .",
    "the starting point of a wrg calculation ( and as we will discuss later the dmrg as well ) is a small system for which we know all of the states and for which we can calculate the matrix elements of all relevant operators including the hamiltonian .",
    "we begin , therefore , by considering a set of @xmath12 contiguous lattice sites - which we will call a _ block _ - with @xmath12 small enough so that we can exactly diagonalize the hamiltonian in the associated subspace .",
    "figure [ wrgsites ] illustrates a chain of lattice sites , with the filled dots representing the sites of the initial system - @xmath13 in this case - and the open dots representing all other sites in the problem . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the number of states in the block for the hubbard model is @xmath14 .",
    "the wrg procedure begins with a calculation of the matrix elements of all relevant operators in the initial block .",
    "the relevant operators are those that enter the hamiltonian , namely @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the hamiltonian ( [ hub ] ) itself .",
    "= 4.5 cm    then we continue as follows :    @xmath18 add the site @xmath19 and calculate the matrix elements of all operators in the enlarged block space of @xmath20 states .",
    "[ note : if we wish , we can partition the states of a site and add only 2 states , rather than 4 in each step .",
    "when this is done , the enlarged block space has @xmath21 states instead of @xmath20 . ]",
    "@xmath22 diagonalize the hamiltonian and select the lowest @xmath23 eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "@xmath24 transform all operators in the enlarged block to a truncated basis involving these @xmath23 states only .",
    "@xmath25 if @xmath19 is lower that the total number of sites @xmath8 , substitute @xmath19 for @xmath12 and repeat steps @xmath26 .",
    "the key ingredient in the wilson renormalization strategy is step @xmath27 ,",
    "whereby @xmath23 states are selected from the @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) states of the enlarged block _ by a purely energetic criterion_. clearly , the accuracy of the method relies on the assumption that the low - energy properties of the system are fully contained in the low - energy states of the individual blocks into which the system was partitioned .",
    "indeed , this was the case for the kondo problem , which was solved by wilson by transforming it to a discretized energy basis , and for other impurity models like the anderson model @xcite .",
    "the kondo model describes the antiferromagnetic interaction of the conduction electrons with a localized impurity .",
    "its hamiltonian in a discretized energy basis takes the form    @xmath28    where @xmath29 creates ( annihilates ) an electron in the energy interval @xmath30 with spin @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the strength of the antiferromagnetic interaction between the conduction electrons and the impurity , @xmath33 is the density of states and @xmath34 is a discretization parameter defining the intervals of energy . for @xmath35 and beginning from the origin ( @xmath36 ) of the linear chain ,",
    "the interaction along the chain decays exponentially , assuring the validity of the truncation procedure .",
    "the wrg was the first numerical implementation of the rg to a non - perturbative problem like the kondo model , for which it had enormous success .",
    "as such , it is still used to this day to study problems with one or few impurities .    unfortunately , the wilson rg can not be applied to other lattice problems .",
    "for example , when it is applied to 1d hubbard models it begins to deviate significantly from the exact results in the fourth iteration .",
    "obviously , the problem resides in the fact that the truncation strategy was based solely on energy arguments .",
    "the solution to this problem was proposed by white with his introduction of the dmrg , which we turn to in the next subsection .",
    "the essential limitation of the wrg , as discussed in the previous subsection , is the method used for truncation at each rg iteration step .",
    "once the enlarged block is constructed by adding the site @xmath19 in step @xmath37 , the hamiltonian in the @xmath19  site subspace of the total hilbert space is diagonalized , without considering the coupling to the rest of the space . obviously , the method will work well when this coupling is perturbatively small .",
    "this is the case for hamiltonians that can be transformed to the form ( [ kondo ] ) . in general",
    ", however , the wrg performs very poorly for strongly correlated lattice systems . in searching for a more suitable method of truncation , white analyzed the case of a block immersed in a medium representing the rest of the system , as depicted in figure [ dmrgblocks1 ] .",
    "= 4.2 cm    assume that we know the ground state @xmath38 of the system and the complete set of @xmath39 states of the block @xmath40 and @xmath4 states of the medium @xmath41 .",
    "then the ground state of the full system @xmath38 can be expanded in the product space of the block and the medium as    @xmath42    our aim is to determine the best approximation @xmath43 to the ground state @xmath44 when we select only @xmath23 states of the block , with @xmath45 . to show how this is done , we will make use of the concept of the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of a matrix @xcite .",
    "the singular value decomposition of the wave function matrix @xmath46 in ( [ psi ] ) permits its factorization as    @xmath47    where the @xmath48 are real positive numbers greater than or equal to 0 , @xmath49 is an orthogonal square matrix of dimension @xmath39 and @xmath50 is a column orthogonal rectangular matrix of dimension @xmath51 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath48 are known as the weight factors of the svd .    up to this point , everything is exact .",
    "now consider what happens if some of the weight factors in ( [ svd ] ) are zero or very small .",
    "if that is the case , then @xmath52 can be very well approximated by discarding them , _",
    "i.e. _ by truncating the sum in ( [ svd ] ) to those with the largest weights .",
    "if fact , it can be shown that the approximate wave function factorized as in ( [ svd ] ) but retaining the largest @xmath23 weight factors has the largest overlap with the exact wave function for any factorization involving @xmath23 terms .    in what follows , we will use the singular value decomposition as a convenient factorization for deriving the conditions for optimal truncation in a density matrix formalism .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the same approach has been used to develop a powerful new technique for numerically diagonalizing the nuclear shell - model problem without actually introducing the dmrg @xcite .",
    "now consider the reduced density matrix of the block associated with the ground state wave function ( [ psi ] ) , which is defined as    @xmath53    with the summation running over the @xmath4 states of the medium .",
    "inserting the factorization ( [ svd ] ) into ( [ ro ] ) and using the orthogonality relations of the matrices @xmath49 and @xmath50 and the normalization of the wave function , we can express the reduced density matrix ( [ ro ] ) as    @xmath54    from this we see that @xmath49 is the matrix of eigenvectors of the reduced density matrix and @xmath55 are the corresponding eigenvalues . each eigenvalue @xmath56 represents the probability of finding the block state @xmath57 in the ground state @xmath38 of the coupled system .",
    "the normalization of the wave function @xmath52 guarantees that the trace of @xmath58 is 1 .",
    "clearly a truncation to @xmath23 states implies the selection of the largest @xmath23 eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "the discarded @xmath59 states contribute with a probability @xmath60 .",
    "this parameter provides an important control on the accuracy of the truncation .",
    "up to now , we have considered the system as being in a pure state .",
    "a similar analysis can be carried out for systems in a mixed state .",
    "mixed states naturally arise when considering a system at finite temperature ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "they can even arise at @xmath62 if we decide to target several states with the dmrg truncation strategy . by using mixed density matrices associated with several states ,",
    "we can build a truncation algorithm whereby the gradually enlarging block optimally reflects the physics of all of the associated states and not just the physics of the ground state .",
    "the most important states of the block , when it is immersed in a mixed - state system , are those corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of the mixed density matrix ,    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the probability with which a given pure state @xmath65 enters in the mixed state . in the case of systems at finite temperature , @xmath64 is the boltzmann factor . for a mixed state at t=0",
    ", we have the freedom to select the weights so as to assign a relative importance to each state .      in the previous subsections we described how we can choose the optimal states of a part of a quantum system from its density matrix in the presence of a medium approximating the rest of the system . here",
    ", we show how this can be used in a systematic treatment of many - site quantum lattices .",
    "we begin by verbally detailing the key ingredients of the method .",
    "the basic idea is to _ systematically _ take into account the physics of _ all _ sites on the lattice .",
    "the procedure begins by starting at the left ( or right ) edge of the lattice and then gradually growing the size of the space that has been taking into account by adding the other lattice sites . at each step of this iterative procedure ,",
    "a truncation is implemented , so as to optimally take into account the effect of the most important states within that part of the problem .",
    "the calculation is carried out as a function of the number of states that are maintained after each iteration .",
    "this parameter , which we call @xmath23 , is gradually increased and the results are plotted against it .",
    "experience suggests that the results converge exponentially with @xmath23 .",
    "thus , once we achieve changes with increasing @xmath23 that are acceptably small we terminate the calculation .    in the following ,",
    "we show how this strategy is implemented at two different levels of complexity , referred to as the infinite algorithm and the finite algorithm , respectively .",
    "we then describe some technical details of importance to the computational feasibility of applying the method .      the infinite algorithm , as we will soon see ,",
    "can only be applied meaningfully in the presence of a uniform ( or translationally invariant ) lattice .",
    "thus , in what follows we assume that the lattice under discussion satisfies this criterion .",
    "consider such a lattice , as illustrated in figure [ dmrg2]a .",
    "assume that each site on the lattice admits @xmath66 states .",
    "in the case of a spin-@xmath67 chain , @xmath68 , corresponding to spin up or spin down . in the case of the t - j model , @xmath69 , as the site can also be empty . finally , as noted earlier , in the hubbard model a site can also have both spin - up and spin - down particles and @xmath70 .",
    "we now begin to add sites , by assumption from the left . until we have included enough sites @xmath71 so that @xmath72 , no truncation is required .",
    "we thus begin our discussion after we have added a sufficient number of sites to be in the truncation regime .",
    "we assume that we have already treated the leftmost @xmath71 lattice sites and have identified the most important @xmath23 states .    at that point",
    ", we can view the problem as illustrated in figure [ dmrg2]b .",
    "the collection of @xmath71 sites that have already been treated is represented by a @xmath73 and denoted @xmath74 . immediately to its right is another site , which contains @xmath66 states and is denoted @xmath75 .",
    "we then have another site to its right , which also contains @xmath66 states and is denoted @xmath76 .",
    "after that we have another block , representing the optimal states from sites @xmath77 . because of the translational invariance of a uniform quantum lattice ,",
    "all parts of the lattice look the same . as a consequence ,",
    "once we know the optimal states from sites @xmath78 we also know the optimal states from any other group of @xmath71 contiguous sites .",
    "this second block is denoted @xmath79 .",
    "and then finally we have other sites to the right that are still to be considered .",
    "= 5.5cm=6.9 cm    we then consider as an enlarged block the @xmath80 states obtained by adding the states of site @xmath75 to those of block @xmath74 .",
    "we will use the density matrix strategy described in the previous subsection to truncate from these @xmath80 states to the optimal @xmath23 states , the same number that we had before we enlarged the block .",
    "as the medium in which to implement the truncation , we use the set of @xmath80 states of the site @xmath76 coupled to the block @xmath79 . the rationale for growing both the block and the medium at the same time",
    "is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    following implementation of the density matrix truncation",
    ", we make the following replacements :    * the set of @xmath23 states of the enlarged block now becomes block @xmath74 . * the next available site to its right becomes @xmath75 * the next site after that becomes @xmath76 . * the truncated set of @xmath23 states from the next @xmath81 sites becomes block @xmath79 .",
    "this leaves us in the same position as in figure [ dmrg2]b , with a block of @xmath23 states , followed by a site of @xmath66 states , then another site of @xmath66 states and finally a block of @xmath23 states . as",
    "before , we build enlarged blocks out of the first two and out of the second two , respectively .",
    "we then truncate the enlarged block from @xmath74 and @xmath75 to the same @xmath23 states as before .",
    "and we then use the translational symmetry of the problem to form another set of four objects , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath79 , and continue the iteration .",
    "this iterative process can be continued until the block includes half of the sites . at this point ,",
    "the superblock contains the physics of all of the sites and thus gives a representation of the entire problem .",
    "such a procedure , in which we grow the system from left to right ( or from right to left ) until all sites have been treated is called the infinite dmrg algorithm .",
    "clearly it requires that the lattice be uniform , so that we can use the translational invariance of the problem to relate the collective structure of the medium to that of the block . in such cases ,",
    "the accuracy of the procedure still depends on how rapidly the correlations between sites fall off .",
    "_ exact _ numerical results can be obtained when the correlations are predominantly between fairly close neighbors or , more precisely , when the correlation length is finite .",
    "a typical example is the @xmath82 heisenberg chain @xcite .",
    "often the above criteria for success of the infinite algorithm are not satisfied and it is necessary to do better . when the lattice is not unform , there is no natural way to build a medium that properly reflects correlations in that part of the lattice .",
    "when the correlations do not fall off significantly rapidly , there is no way to take into account the effects of distant sites - those that are not part of the medium - in defining the collective structure of the block .",
    "a way to overcome these limitations is to use the so - called finite algorithm , which we now describe .",
    "the basic idea of the finite algorithm is that we _",
    "sweep _ forwards and backwards through the set of sites , at each stage updating the information from the previous sweep .",
    "we will continue to focus here on quantum lattices , and in that context show how the method is implemented .",
    "we will first carry out the discussion for a uniform lattice and then mention the modifications needed when the lattice is not uniform .    as before we begin by growing the system from the left .",
    "for a unform lattice , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ dmrg2]a , we follow the infinite algorithm until half of the sites have been treated in the left block and half in the right block . in each iteration we store on hard disk all relevant matrix elements within the block for later use . from this point on , the superblocks will involve all the @xmath8 sites of the finite lattice .",
    "we then continue to grow the sites in the left block , one at a time . for each enlarged block ,",
    "we use for the medium the remaining set of sites from the right half .",
    "all information on that set of sites is obtained by a reflection from the stored information of the left block from an earlier iteration , assuming inversion symmetry around the center of the lattice .",
    "we continue this process until the left block has been grown to include all sites but three . at this point , we have stored information on all subgroups of sites , from 2 through @xmath83 .",
    "that information includes the matrix elements of all sub - operators of the hamiltonian , within the space of states being maintained .",
    "if the lattice is not uniform , we must use a slightly different strategy , since there is no simple prescription for relating the states of the medium to those of the block .",
    "one possibility is to use the wilson rg procedure , growing the system one site at a time and truncating by energy considerations @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can use the infinite algorithm , beginning with blocks at the two ends and gradually expanding them by adding sites in between in the direction of the lattice center @xcite . in either case",

    "we begin to enlarge the right block , by adding one site at a time .",
    "the medium for this enlarged block is the set of sites on the left , which consists of the block @xmath41 and the extra site .",
    "note that all relevant information on the block @xmath41 was stored in the previous sweep .    at this point , we reverse again , sweeping from left to right . the sweep process is continued iteratively until the results from one sweep are acceptably close to those from the previous sweep .",
    "the comparison can be done for the ground - state energy and for the density matrix eigenvalues of the retained states .",
    "note that the first ( or warm - up ) stage , in which we sweep through the sites for the first time , need not necessarily produce very good results , since we still have the opportunity to improve on them in subsequent iterations .",
    "it is for this reason that the finite algorithm can provide a good approximation to the physics of non - unform lattices .      for the purposes of this discussion ,",
    "we assume that the hamiltonian describing the system under investigation contains one- and two - body terms only and can be written as    @xmath84    the above hamiltonian is itself built up out of other operators , which we referred to earlier and will continue to refer to as the hamiltonian sub - operators .",
    "they are    @xmath85    plus their hermitean adjoints .",
    "a key to the computational feasibility of the dmrg algorithms described earlier in this subsection is that it can be readily automated , using information from previous steps .",
    "here we discuss this point in somewhat more detail .",
    "as we have seen , the dmrg approach involves a systematic enlargement of blocks , followed by a truncation to the same block size as before the enlargement .",
    "consider a representative block enlargement as illustrated in figure [ dmrg4 ] .",
    "the original block @xmath86 with dimension @xmath87 was obtained from an earlier step , at which point the matrix elements of all sub - operators of the hamiltonian ( see eq .",

    "if it is a single lattice site , the matrix elements of the hamiltonian sub - operators were stored at the outset of the calculation . in either case , the matrix elements of all hamiltonian sub - operators are accessible in storage when the enlargement of the block is implemented .",

    "( [ sub - ops ] ) .",
    "obviously , the number of terms in the sum increases with the number of creation and/or annihilation operators that define the composite operator being treated .",

    "the method described worked directly in the real space of lattices , growing the system through the addition of sites .",
    "a key to the success of the dmrg algorithm is being able to define an appropriate order in which to add layers of the onion . in the case of lattices",

    "what is the correct path through this set of lattice sites to consider ?    for such reasons , it may be useful when dealing with lattices in more than one dimension to consider an alternative labelling of the states of the system , one that is more conducive to a natural ordering .    in 1994 ,",
    "xiang @xcite proposed the possibility of carrying out dmrg calculations in momentum space , rather than in real space . in this section ,",
    "we review the new ideas that emerged from this proposal .",
    "as we will see in the next section , this idea provides the inspiration for the algorithms that have since been developed for finite fermi systems , the principal focus of this review .    to make the ideas most transparent",
    ", we will carry out the discussion in terms of the two - dimensional hubbard model with nearest - neighbor hopping , as was done in the original paper of xiang .",
    "the hamiltonian for this model was given earlier in eq .",
    "( [ hub ] ) .",
    "the operator that creates a particle in bloch state @xmath103 with spin @xmath3 and momentum @xmath104 and the one that creates a particle with the same spin @xmath3 but at lattice site @xmath2 are related according to    @xmath105    where @xmath8 is the total number of sites in the lattice and @xmath106 is the coordinate - space location of site @xmath2 .    using this , it is straightforward to transform the hubbard hamiltonian ( [ hub ] ) to momentum space ,    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the number operator for particles with spin @xmath3 and momentum @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the energy dispersion of the particles , which is explicitly diagonal in the momentum basis .    in particular , by diagonalizing the one - body hopping term for a 2d lattice we find that    @xmath111    in table [ hubbard12 ] , we give the momentum  spectrum \" for a 2d 4@xmath104 lattice .",
    "possible values for @xmath112 and @xmath113 in this case are -@xmath114/2 , 0 , @xmath114/2 , and @xmath114 .",
    "what is clear is that there is a large degeneracy at half filling .",
    "while it is natural to consider filling momentum - space levels in order of increasing energy dispersion , it is clear that there will be a problem with degeneracies ( or near degeneracies when more general hopping terms are used ) .",
    "thus , the rationale we gave above for introducing momentum space - namely to provide a more natural ordering of levels ( onion layers ) - may not turn out to be warranted .",
    "nevertheless , we will discuss what happens when the methodology is in fact used . before doing so , however , we will first discuss some issues related to the implementation of the momentum - space dmrg algorithm , which we subsequently refer to as the kdmrg .",
    "ccc @xmath115 & degeneracy & ( @xmath112,@xmath113 ) + -4 & 1 & ( 0 , 0 ) + -2 & 4 & ( -@xmath114/2,0 ) , ( 0,-@xmath114/2 ) , ( @xmath114/2,0 ) , ( 0,@xmath114/2 ) + 0 & 6 & ( -@xmath114/2,-@xmath114/2 ) , ( -@xmath114/2,@xmath114/2 ) , ( @xmath114/2,-@xmath114/2 ) , ( @xmath114/2,@xmath114/2 ) , ( @xmath114,0 ) , ( 0,@xmath114 ) + 2 & 4 & ( -@xmath114/2,@xmath114 ) , ( @xmath114/2,@xmath114 ) , ( @xmath114,-@xmath114/2 ) , ( @xmath114,@xmath114/2 ) + 4 & 1 & ( @xmath114,@xmath114 ) +      as emphasized by xiang in his original paper , the two - body interaction appearing in ( [ khub ] ) contains of order @xmath116 terms , since each of the sums goes over @xmath8 possible momentum values .",
    "thus , a straightforward application of the dmrg algorithm in momentum space would require iteratively calculating and storing matrix elements of @xmath117 operators , which would obviously be very time and memory consuming for a large number of sites .",
    "xiang figured out a very clever way to group the operators , so as to dramatically reduce the number whose matrix elements need to be calculated and stored . since an analogous strategy will be required in all extensions of the usual rdmrg method , we will now discuss how this is accomplished .",
    "consider the following set of operators , operating in a subspace @xmath86 of the full 2d hubbard hilbert space :    @xmath118    the total number of such composite operators is @xmath119 , significantly less than the total number of sub - operators of the full hubbard hamiltonian in momentum space .    for notational purposes ,",
    "we only use the above set of composite operators when referring to block a. when considering another block b , we systematically replace @xmath120 by @xmath121 .",
    "the key point is that all matrix elements needed for the iterative algorithm can be obtained from these composite operators . to see this ,",
    "consider for example the hubbard hamiltonian in a product space a@xmath10b .",

    "the same remarks can be straightforwardly shown to apply .",
    "the above development is specific to the hubbard hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hub ] ) .",
    "however , as we will discuss later , similar considerations are essential to preserve the computational feasibility of the dmrg algorithm in the more general quantum problems that arise in the description of finite fermi systems .      as noted earlier , the real - space dmrg when applied to uniform quantum lattices benefits greatly from the fact that all positions on the lattice look the same .",
    "thus , once a certain portion of the lattice has been treated , the same results can be transferred to any equivalent set of sites .",
    "the momentum - space dmrg loses this simplicity .",
    "a given group of quantized momentum levels has no obvious relation to any other group .",
    "of course the equivalence of a given group of sites on a uniform lattice to any other analogous group was a consequence of the translational invariance of the problem .",
    "that symmetry is not lost by transforming to momentum space ; it simply shows up elsewhere",
    ". in particular , in momentum space the translational invariance of the lattice shows up in terms of momentum conservation .",
    "when building the superblock , we need not mix states of different total momentum .",
    "this has the advantage of reducing the size of the superblocks in momentum space compared to real space , even for the same assumed block dimension .    in building states of a given total momentum in the superblock",
    ", we must maintain all allowed momentum states for the blocks themselves .",
    "the resulting density matrix for the block will thus contain different momenta .",
    "however , it will be block diagonal in momentum and thus likewise be effectively reduced in dimension relative to the corresponding matrix in real space .",
    "similar considerations play a role in applications of the dmrg to finite fermi systems , where symmetries likewise must be treated carefully . in rotationally - invariant systems , for example , angular momentum is a conserved quantum number . as we will discuss in section iv , full incorporation of angular momentum symmetry",
    "can be built into the formalism , but at an increase in complexity .",
    "minimally , however , when working in a basis of single - particle states with well - defined angular momentum projection , we can build states with conserved m - projection and thereby reduce the size of the superblocks that must be diagonalized . any additive quantum number associated with an abelian symmetry can be used in this way to reduce the size of the superblock and to make the reduced density matrices block diagonal .      in a real - space description of uniform lattices",
    ", we can use the equivalence of contiguous sites throughout the lattice to facilitate the introduction of a medium with which to build a dmrg superblock in the warm - up phase . in momentum - space , as noted above , this is no longer the case . on the one hand , this makes it clear that it is not appropriate to use the infinite dmrg algorithm when working in momentum space . but even with the finite algorithm it is necessary to adopt a strategy for implementing the warm - up phase , where the first approximation to the description of the the various size blocks is obtained .    in the work of xiang and the others who have implemented the kdmrg ,",
    "the procedure has been to perform truncation in the warm - up phase according to wilson s numerical rg procedure , namely to truncate to the lowest eigenstates of the enlarged block hamiltonian . as for a real - space description of non - uniform lattices ,",
    "the expectation is that subsequent sweeps should correct any deficiencies that might exist in this procedure .",
    "having described the key elements of the kdmrg method , we now discuss some of the applications that have been reported .",
    "we first discuss some of the results reported by xiang in the paper that first introduced the method @xcite .",
    "the calculations were carried out for the 1d and 2d hubbard models , using the standard hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hub ] ) .",
    "they were performed as a function of the number of lattice sites @xmath8 and the ratio @xmath125 of the strength of the on - site coulomb repulsion to that of the one - body hopping term . in the case of the 1d model ,",
    "all calculations were done at half filling , whereas the 2d calculations considered different filling fractions . in all cases , the number of states @xmath23 kept in each truncation was 1000 and comparison with exact results was reported where available .",
    "applications in 1d showed two important points : ( 1 ) that the momentum - space dmrg method is significantly more accurate than the wilson rg when applied to the 1d hubbard model , and ( 2 ) that the kdmrg results for 1d lattices are less precise than those for real - space dmrg .",
    "the latter conclusion is worthy of further comment .",
    "as noted earlier , the accuracy of the dmrg algorithm depends critically on how rapidly the correlations fall off . in real space , the correlations decay with distance since the hamiltonian only couples neighboring lattice sites .",
    "an analogous statement does not apply in momentum space , where the interaction is highly non - local and can strongly couple momentum states that are far apart . a critical question there is how strong is this coupling relative to the single - particle splittings between the bloch states .",
    "nevertheless , the conclusion to draw from this work is that when studying 1d lattices using the dmrg algorithm , the real - space formalism remains the method of choice .",
    "xiang s results for the hubbard model on a @xmath126 2d lattice are summarized in table [ xiang2d ] .",
    "the results are shown for several values of @xmath125 and for several numbers of electrons .",
    "where available they are also compared with results of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and stochastic diagonalization ( sq ) calculations .",
    "there are two key points to note .",
    "the first is that the method works very well for weak on - site repulsion .",
    "this should not be surprising , since it is exact when @xmath127 . in that case , the exact solution - a slater determinant of bloch states up to the fermi momentum - is a trivial one - state kdmrg wave function .",
    "the second point to note is that the method continues to work reasonably well even for stronger coupling , producing results that are competitive with those obtained using the two other popular many - body methods against which it was compared .",

    "they redid some of the calculations reported by xiang and also carried out a much more systematic investigation , considering several different hopping scenarios .",
    "an important difference of their calculations relative to those of xiang was in the blocking scheme .",
    "these authors applied white s blocking scheme , adding two sites at a time to enlarge the superblock .",
    "xiang , in his kdmrg work , added only one site at a time .",
    "this makes it somewhat difficult to draw comparative conclusions , as the sizes of the superblocks that would arise in the two blocking approaches are different for the same number of states @xmath23 retained in each block .",
    "we summarize here some of the key conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite .    * in 1d with nearest - neighbor hopping",
    ", xiang s results do not match theirs .",
    "several possible explanations were put forth , including that xiang s calculations may not have converged and that it could be a consequence of the different blocking schemes used in the two calculations . * in 2d , both the rdmrg and the kdmrg become less accurate with increasing dimensionality , albeit for different reasons . in real space , it relates to the level of off - diagonal coupling . in momentum space",
    ", it relates to the increased degeneracies and to the long - range nature of the interaction . *",
    "the kdmrg is less dependent on the form of the hopping term . in real space ,",
    "the method becomes rapidly worse as the hopping range increases ; this is not the case in momentum space .",
    "* in agreement with xiang , they find that the accuracy of the dmrg method becomes worse with increasing strength @xmath5 , scaled by the band width . * in the case of the @xmath126 2d lattice at half filling , the kdmrg was found to be more accurate than the rdmrg for @xmath132 .",
    "the real - space dmrg has proven extremely successful in describing the physics of one - dimensional systems with short - range interactions . as discussed in sect .",
    "ii.b.4 , the method can be extended to 2d systems by selecting a particular path covering the lattice at the expense of introducing long - range interactions .",
    "these long - range interactions arise between neighboring sites in the 2d lattice , which may be located far away within the selected 1d path .",
    "the interplay between short - range and long - range interactions works to the detriment of the optimal accuracy of the 1d dmrg and to an increase in the memory requirements to implement the algorithm , because of the necessity of storing the matrix elements of long - range correlators . in practice ,",
    "real - space 2d dmrg calculations were therefore restricted to small clusters or to ladders up to six legs @xcite .",
    "the kdmrg represented a possible way to extend the dmrg methodology to larger dimensions .",
    "unfortunately , the results obtained for the hubbard models of 2d lattices were not very encouraging and the procedure was not pursued very much .",
    "however , the formal procedure developed by xiang to reduce the number of matrix elements needed to store at each iteration was a critical step in the subsequent application of the dmrg methodology to finite fermi systems , to which we now turn .    in finite fermi systems",
    "one typically starts with a one- plus two - body hamiltonian expressed in some single - particle basis,@xmath133 where @xmath134 takes into account the kinetic energy and the mean - field interaction between particles and @xmath135 represents the residual interaction .",
    "a typical basis used in studies in quantum chemistry , nuclear physics , matter waves , etc . involves the use of the hartree - fock ( hf ) mean - field approximation .",
    "other frequently - considered possibilities include the kohn - sham basis or approximate mean fields . as an example of the latter",
    ", nuclear structure calculations often use for simplicity a 3d harmonic oscillator basis or a basis comprised of the eigenstates of a woods - saxon potential , as approximations to the nuclear mean - field potential .    the first attempt to apply the dmrg to a 3d finite fermi system",
    "was performed by white and martin@xcite .",
    "they proposed the use of the dmrg for @xmath136 @xmath137 calculations of the electronic structure of molecules .",
    "the method was further studied and refined for calculations in quantum chemistry and for application to quantum hall systems @xcite .",
    "other forms of the dmrg procedure were developed and applied to ultrasmall superconducting grains@xcite and the nuclear shell model@xcite . in the following subsections , we describe the progress achieved in each of these domains , as well as the difficulties and limitations of the procedures that were used .",
    "calculations in quantum chemistry ( qc ) are based on the approximate treatment of a system of @xmath8 electrons moving in a field created by @xmath41 fixed atomic nuclei and interacting through the coulomb force .",
    "the electronic hamiltonian of the system is    @xmath138    there are two possible avenues @xcite for the treatment of the electronic hamiltonian ( [ he ] ) .",
    "one involves the use of density functional theory ( dft ) , which has been used extensively and with great success in the treatment of fairly large molecules .",
    "the other involves the use of hartree - fock ( hf ) mean - field theory as a starting point for an improved treatment of the electron - electron interaction .    in principle , the best means of treating the electron - electron interaction in a hf framework is through the full configuration interaction ( ci ) approach @xcite . in this approach , the electron - electron interaction is exactly diagonalized in a basis of orthogonal states generated by the hf method . for problems that are not too large , this can be implemented through the use of diagonalization routines appropriate to sparse matrices , such as lanczos or davidson . with present computational resources",
    ", matrices of dimension @xmath139 to @xmath140 can be treated in this way , with little hope of a dramatic increase in the future . other approximate but very accurate",
    "methods to treat the residual electronic interactions , such as coupled cluster theory ( cct ) , are often used , but like the full ci they scale exponentially with the number of basis states , thereby imposing limitations on the hamiltonian matrix dimensions that can be treated and permitting complete calculations for relatively small molecules only .",
    "the dmrg method was proposed by white and martin @xcite as an alternative procedure for approximately diagonalizing the residual electronic interaction , but in a much more computationally efficient way . despite requiring a much slower polynomial computational effort ,",
    "the method nevertheless has been shown to provide highly accurate results .",
    "more precisely , the dmrg computational effort scales as @xmath141 where @xmath30 is the total number of basis states and @xmath23 is the number of states retained in the iterative algorithm .",
    "this suggests that application of the dmrg algorithm to the field of qc could open up the possibility of a wide range of highly accurate molecular structure calculations , well beyond the limits of the full ci .",
    "the usual way to generate a second quantized hamiltonian in a finite molecular basis is to first consider a small number of atomic orbital states for each atomic nucleus , generating a local non - orthogonal basis , and then to use hf mean - field theory to produce an orthogonal molecular basis of @xmath30 orbitals , doubly - degenerate in the spin quantum number .",
    "the second - quantized hamiltonian in this basis is    @xmath142    where @xmath143 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron in orbital @xmath2 with spin projection @xmath7 .",
    "the matrix @xmath61 is a radial integral of the electron kinetic energy and the electron - nucleus interaction in the hf basis , while the matrix v is a corresponding radial integral of the repulsive coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "the key point in applying the dmrg procedure to qc problems is to treat each orbital as a  site \" in a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "this site can be empty , singly occupied with spin up , singly occupied with spin down , or doubly occupied .",
    "the situation is analogous to the kdmrg and in fact it was the use of the xiang trick for reducing the three - index operators to an effective one - index operator that made the procedure tractable in qc .",
    "the most complex operators that need to be calculated and stored in each iteration are those with two electronic creation and/or annihilation operators , requiring storage space of order @xmath144 .",
    "as we will see below , a key issue , which is still not in our view fully resolved , is how to establish the optimal relative order among the orbitals .",
    "two possibilities are to order the orbitals in terms of hf energies or to maximize the interactions between neighboring orbitals . a satisfactory resolution of this problem",

    "this ordering is not always equivalent to the cuthill - mckee ordering that had been proposed in @xcite .",
    "there have been several other applications of the dmrg algorithm in quantum chemistry to large polymers @xcite .",
    "these applications have typically utilized the original real - space dmrg algorithm building on the fact that polymers can be represented either by a chain or by another cyclic structure .",
    "since our focus is on applications that require the machinery appropriate to finite fermi systems , we will not discuss these applications here .      in 1959 , anderson @xcite posed the question of what would be the lower size limit for a metallic grain to sustain superconductivity . since the average level spacing @xmath204 in a metallic particle is inversely proportional to its volume , for small enough particles ( namely when @xmath204 is of the order of the bulk gap @xmath205 ) the scattering of pairs across the fermi surface ceases to be an efficient mechanism for lowering the energy of the system . at this point superconductivity",
    "should therefore disappear .",
    "anderson estimated the critical grain size to be in the range of nanometers .",
    "this old question has recently been revived in the context of experiments performed by ralph , black and tinkham @xcite on ultrasmall aluminum grains .",
    "they succeeded in constructing a single electron transistor whose central island was an al grain of a few nanometers with an estimated mean level spacing @xmath206 , of the order of the bulk gap .",
    "the experiments showed the existence of a spectroscopic gap that could be driven to zero by the application of magnetic fields .",
    "the hamiltonian proposed in @xcite to study the physics of such small grains is of the reduced bcs form ,    @xmath207    where @xmath208 label the single - particle energy levels , which are assumed to be equally spaced ( @xmath209 ) , and @xmath210 are the electron annihilation operators associated with the two time - reversed states @xmath211 and @xmath212 . finally , @xmath31 is the chemical potential and @xmath213 is an adimensional bcs coupling constant , whose appropriate value for al grains is 0.224 @xcite .",

    "in such systems , there are strong number fluctuations proportional to @xmath216 .",
    "several levels of approximations were thus applied to the hamiltonian ( [ d1 ] ) , to see whether any could describe the physics of pairing in finite systems . in increasing order of complexity , they included i ) bcs approximation with parity projection @xcite , ii ) lanczos diagonalization up to @xmath217 with finite - size corrections @xcite , and iii ) number - projected bcs @xcite approximation .",
    "all of these approximations predicted a phase transition from superconducting behavior to a normal state at a critical grain size , and in all cases the transition was _",
    "abrupt_. in contrast , the dmrg method ",
    "when applied in a somewhat modified form @xcite  showed that the crossover as a function of decreasing grain size had a smooth reduction in pairing correlations .",
    "following completion of @xcite , the authors learned that the hamiltonian ( [ d1 ] ) had been solved exactly by richardson during the 1960s @xcite .",
    "this made it possible to carry out a comparison of the dmrg results with those obtained from richardson s exact solution .",
    "for the largest system treated , with 400 doubly - degenerate levels , the condensation energy was @xmath218 with a predicted relative error of @xmath219 .",
    "richardson s exact result was @xmath220 , confirming the accuracy of the phdmrg . and",
    "showing that the relative error predicted by the dmrg method was in fact appropriate . on this basis , it is clear that the dmrg method provides an essentially exact description of the physics of pairing in finite systems and that the correct crossover from superconducting to the normal state is indeed smooth and not abrupt .",
    "the modifications implemented in the dmrg method for its application to small metallic grains were based on the fact that in a finite fermi system the fermi energy ( @xmath221 ) naturally separates the single - particle space into a primarily occupied subspace and another primarily empty subspace .",
    "the method that emerges from such a construction was called the particle - hole dmrg ( phdmrg ) , which we now briefly describe .",
    "consider the set of single - particle levels shown in fig .",
    "note that they are divided into two sets .",
    "the particle levels are those above the fermi surface , which should be essentially empty .",
    "the hole levels are those below the fermi surface and they should be essentially filled . in the phdmrg method , one first defines particle and hole blocks from the levels nearest to the fermi surface , and then gradually grows those blocks by adding levels progressively further away .",
    "the figure is meant to signify that we have already created particle and hole blocks involving the first two available levels , respectively , and are enlarging them by adding the third level(s ) .",
    "the particle block then serves as the medium for the hole block and the hole block as the medium for the particle block as we implement the dmrg truncation strategy .",
    "this process is continued until all particle and hole levels have been treated .",
    "= 5.5 cm = 7.2 cm    the phdmrg procedure , as just described , is related to the infinite dmrg algorithm in that sweeping is not implemented .",
    "it is extremely difficult to implement sweeping with particle and hole blocks while at the same time preserving the four block structure of the method . as such",
    ", it is expected that the phdmrg will only work well for systems where the correlations fall off rapidly as we move away from the fermi surface .",
    "the key point is that at the beginning of the iterative procedure the levels that are outside the particle - hole superblock do not impact on the selection of the optimal state(s ) with which to truncate the two blocks .",
    "this is a recurring limitation of the infinite algorithm , which can be partially overcome by combining the dmrg truncation strategy with the use of effective interaction theory . in the application to ultrasmall superconducting grains , this",
    "was implemented through a phenomenological renormalization of the pairing strength at each iteration . when the system described by the pairing hamiltonian ( [ d1 ] ) for @xmath214 levels at half filling is considered in bcs approximation , the bulk gap is given by @xmath222 .",
    "the effect of the levels outside a superblock that consists of @xmath223 levels can thus be taken into account in an average way by introducing an effective coupling strength @xmath224  corresponding to step @xmath30 of the iteration  such that the gap in the superblock being considered equals the bulk gap .",
    "this is guaranteed if the renormalized coupling strength @xmath224 is chosen according to    @xmath225    note that the pairing strength assumes its full value when all levels are included , _",

    "there is a very smooth crossover as the size of the grains decrease , from superconducting grains to metallic grains with strong pairing fluctuations .",

    "the second is the josephson coupling , namely the strength of the term in the hamiltonian that governs pair tunnelling .    for the purposes of this review , perhaps the key point that emerged from the study",
    "concerns the range of validity of the two - grain dmrg method as a function of these two variables .",

    "the two - grain dmrg method has a very different range of validity .",
    "it does not in general work well for weakly - coupled grains , except if the grain sizes are sufficiently small .",

    "@xcite , does not work very well for @xmath281 .",
    "there are several possible reasons for the failure of these calculations .",
    "one is that the infinite algorithm that was used can not capture the correlations between the different single - particle levels in the problem .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to incorporate sweeping in the phdmrg , especially for systems with active neutrons and protons , because of the preponderance of blocks involved .",
    "a second is that the method , as used , does not preserve rotational invariance . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss how rotational invariance , and other non - abelian symmetries , can be built into the dmrg . a third concerns the order in which the levels were included . as noted in sect .",
    "[ qc ] , a hf ordering , or indeed any ordering based solely on single - particle energy considerations , may not be optimal .",
    "finally there are possible issues regarding implementation of the dmrg truncation algorithm .",
    "in particular , no effort was made in the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite to ensure that at least one state of each partition ( number of particles / holes and their spin projection ) was maintained in each iteration . in a more traditional dmrg study of @xmath281",
    ", it was found that implementation of such a condition dramatically improved convergence of the results @xcite .",
    "symmetries are a crucial element of all quantum systems .",
    "the invariance of a system under a group of symmetry transformations gives rise to conserved quantum numbers for the physical states of the system and associated degeneracies . in the case of uniform quantum lattices ,",
    "translational invariance is a natural symmetry , with the associated conserved quantum number being the linear momentum . in spin lattices ,",
    "the total spin of the system is likewise a conserved quantum number for all physical states . and in finite fermi systems , total angular momentum is conserved as a reflection of the rotational invariance of the system .    methods of approximately solving the schrdinger equation frequently break the symmetries of the hamiltonian and thereby lead to states that do not contain the appropriate quantum numbers .",
    "often this is done intentionally , as spontaneous breaking of symmetries is a natural way to include collective correlations between the particles in the system .",
    "it is then critical , however , to restore the broken symmetries in order to establish contact with the states of the physical system , i.e. , those probed in experiment .",
    "the dmrg method , being a truncation of the full hilbert space of the problem , in general violates symmetries , _ unless it is implemented very carefully_. to understand this , consider the problem of a spin lattice , where we gradually add spin sites as we grow the system . to construct states of good total spin ,",
    "it is necessary to include all the spin projections required by the clebsch gordan series .",
    "truncation to a limited number of states based solely on density matrix considerations will not in general keep all the spin configurations needed to reconstruct the full spin eigenstates .    as pointed out by white @xcite , it is possible to preserve spin symmetry , in principle , by careful implementation of the density matrix strategy . in particular , as long as the density matrix truncation always includes all states from degenerate multiplets , it will preserve spin symmetry .",
    "however , because of the numerical limitations inherent in computational algorithms , it is extremely difficult to guarantee that we do not eliminate states that in a perfect calculation were degenerate with those that are kept . equally important , it is not feasible to fix the number of states kept a priori in such a calculation , since that number is dictated by the sizes of the degenerate multiplets .    for the above reasons , several groups have been looking into alternative ways to conserve symmetries within the dmrg algorithm . in this section",
    ", we briefly review the important progress that has been made .",
    "the first significant progress along these lines was the work of sierra and nishino @xcite . in their work",
    ", they showed that hamiltonians with a continuous symmetry could be recast into the form of interaction round a face ( irf ) hamiltonians , familiar in statistical mechanics .",
    "they then showed how to develop a dmrg algorithm appropriate to irf hamiltonians .",
    "the method was applied to several spin chains with impressive success .",
    "examples include the spin-1/2 @xcite , spin-1 and spin-2 @xcite heisenberg chains and the xxz chain @xcite . in all cases",
    "considered , the method achieved significantly greater accuracy than the usual dmrg algorithm when keeping the same number of states .    despite the historical importance of the irf - dmrg algorithm in the proper incorporation of symmetries in the dmrg , it is difficult to imagine its use for more complex systems with more complicated symmetries . where major progress was made towards the development of a general framework for incorporating symmetries in the dmrg was through the work of mcculloch and gulcsi @xcite .",
    "their work presented a formalism that could be applied to any group of symmetry transformations , through proper construction of basis states that preserve the symmetry .",
    "they refer to this as the non - abelian dmrg method . in the following subsection",
    ", we describe in some detail how their method can be applied to a finite fermi system with conserved total angular momentum",
    ". we will refer to this specific example of their method as the jdmrg algorithm .      in htis subsection ,",
    "we develop the jdmrg formalism , showing in some detail how it can be implemented for finite fermi systems so as to produce exact angular momentum eigenstates . for simplicity , we restrict the discussion to systems with but one type of particle . for systems with two or more types of particles , atomic nuclei being an example , some slight modifications are required .",
    "we begin by stating the problem .",
    "we wish to solve the schrdinger equation for a set of @xmath8 identical particles subject to a hamiltonian written in second - quantized form as    @xmath287 _ { 0}^{0 } ~,\\ ] ]    where @xmath288 .",
    "note that we are assuming here that the particles under discussion are created ( annihilated ) in the single - particle state @xmath289 by the operator @xmath290 and that the irreducible tensor operator associated with the single - particle annihilation operator is defined by @xmath291 . by working in terms of the irreducible tensor operators @xmath292 and @xmath293 ,",
    "we are able to couple operators directly and thus properly reflect the scalar nature of the hamiltonian .",
    "note that we use a coupling notation whereby @xmath294 and @xmath295^j_m$ ] refer to coupled irreducible tensor operators of rank @xmath32 and projection @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath8 particles will be restricted to a finite set of single - particle levels @xmath289 , as depicted schematically in figure [ jdmrg]a for five orbits .",
    "the orbits are shown in ascending order according to their single - particle energies @xmath296 .",
    "the jdmrg procedure involves three stages .",
    "the first is a preliminary stage , in which all necessary information on the individual active single - particle orbits are calculated and stored .",
    "the second is the  warm - up \" stage , familiar to all dmrg algorithms . and",
    "the third is the likewise familiar  sweeping stage \" .      as the procedure will include the effects of all active single - particle levels in an angular - momentum coupled representation , we must store the following :    * all single - shell states @xmath297 , for the various active orbits @xmath298 . here",
    "@xmath299 refers to the number of particles in the state and @xmath300 refers to any additional quantum numbers needed to fully describe the state of total angular momentum @xmath301 . * the one - particle coefficients of fractional parentage ( cfps ) for all active orbits .",
    "these are the expansion coefficients required to express an antisymmetrized @xmath30-particle state as a product of antisymmetrized states of @xmath302 particles and a single particle . * the reduced ( or double - bar ) matrix elements of all possibly relevant operators for those orbits , namely @xmath303 , @xmath304^k$ ] , @xmath305^k$ ] , @xmath306^k$ ] and @xmath307 ^ 0 $ ] .",
    "the reduced matrix elements of @xmath308 and @xmath309 are very simply related to the one - particle cfps .",
    "the reduced matrix elements of the more - complicated product operators can be obtained from them using well - known formulae @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the warm - up phase , in which we build a first approximation to the dominant structure within groups of active orbits .",
    "as we will see , most of the formalism we develop for the warm - up phase will also be needed in the sweep phase . in fig .",
    "[ jdmrg]b , we schematically illustrate the  warm - up \" phase for the same set of five orbits .",
    "we start off with the first orbit @xmath310 , for which all the single - shell matrix elements were calculated in the  preliminary \" stage .",
    "we then add the second orbit , forming an enlarged  block \" .",
    "this is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ jdmrg]b , where the enlarged block contains orbits @xmath310 and @xmath311 .",
    "next , we must build the reduced matrix elements of all relevant sub - operators of the hamiltonian for the enlarged block . to see how this is done , we consider a generic block involving @xmath71 orbits , @xmath312 .",
    "the enlarged block basis , in which orbit @xmath313 has been added , is @xmath314 .",
    "the matrix elements of the single - particle creation operator @xmath315 in the enlarged block are    @xmath316    @xmath317 @xmath318    @xmath319 @xmath320    it involves a reduced matrix element from the previous iteration ( which has already been calculated ) and a reduced matrix element for the orbit that is being added ( which was calculated in the preliminary stage ) .",
    "thus , all information is available to calculate this reduced matrix element , and indeed all others , in the enlarged block .",
    "as in all dmrg algorithms , we now wish to choose out of all the states in the enlarged block those to keep . here",
    "the strategy is somewhat different depending on whether there is only one kind of particle or two .",
    "if there are two kinds of particle , one can couple the corresponding states together , build and diagonalize the superblock hamiltonian and then truncate in the sector of interest by using its reduced density matrix , assuming each type of particle is the medium for the other .",
    "when there is only one kind of particle , as in the example under discussion , an alternative strategy must be found .",
    "a natural one is to use the wilson rg strategy of diagonalizing the hamiltonian in the enlarged space and keeping the @xmath23 lowest eigenstates for each value of @xmath30 and @xmath32 .    following truncation , the reduced matrix elements for the truncated enlarged block are calculated and stored on hard disk",
    "this is done for all size blocks , @xmath310 , @xmath321 , @xmath322 , @xmath323 , and @xmath324 .",
    "we now discuss the sweep stage , whereby we sweep back and forth through the single - particle levels to improve the description of each block by optimally taking into account its correlation with _ all _ other levels .",
    "the sweep stage is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ jdmrg]c for the same five orbits . at the point represented by the figure , we are sweeping backwards through the single - particle levels and have treated as a block the last two levels , @xmath325 and @xmath326 .",
    "we wish to enlarge this block to include level @xmath327 .",
    "the medium for this enlarged will be levels @xmath321 .",
    "the sweep stage involves first a calculation of all relevant matrix elements in the enlarged block consisting of levels @xmath328 .",
    "this can be done using exactly the same formulae developed for the warm - up stage , with one example given in eq .",
    "( [ coupledmes ] ) .",
    "once we have calculated all matrix elements in the enlarged block , we construct the states of the superblock by coupling those of the enlarged block ( orbits @xmath329 ) to those of the medium ( orbits @xmath321 ) , _ viz : _ @xmath330 .",
    "we only construct states with the correct total number of particles @xmath331 .",
    "the calculation of the hamiltonian matrix in the superblock involves a sum of terms , each being a product of a reduced matrix element in the enlarged block ( just calculated ) and a reduced matrix element in the medium ( output from the previous sweep or the warm up ) .    as always , the sweep stage is iterated until acceptable convergence has been achieved .",
    "the first application @xcite of the non - abelian dmrg method was reported by mcculloch and gulcsi for the one - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "this model has the usual spin symmetry and also a pseudo - spin symmetry generated by the set of operators @xmath332 , @xmath333 , and @xmath334 .",
    "thus the dmrg algorithm can be implemented at three levels : ( 1 ) by only including the spin projection as a conserved quantum number ( called @xmath335 ) , ( 2 ) by including the total spin as a conserved quantum number ( called @xmath336 ) and ( 3 ) by considering both the total spin and the pseudo - spin as good quantum numbers ( called @xmath337 ) .",
    "there is also an additive ( or abelian ) symmetry of number conservation ( likewise @xmath335 ) , which can be included at each of the three levels .",
    "results for the three levels of dmrg application are summarized in table [ tablemg1 ] for a half - filled 60-site hubbard lattice with @xmath338 .",
    "cccccr basis & @xmath23 & @xmath339 & @xmath340 & @xmath341 & cpu + @xmath342 & @xmath156 & @xmath156 & @xmath343 & @xmath344 & @xmath146 + @xmath345 & @xmath162 & @xmath162 & @xmath346 & @xmath347 & @xmath348 + @xmath349 & @xmath156 & @xmath350 & @xmath351 & @xmath352 & @xmath353 + @xmath349 & @xmath162 & @xmath354 & @xmath355 & @xmath356 & @xmath357 + @xmath337 & @xmath156 & @xmath358 & @xmath359 & @xmath360 & @xmath251 + @xmath337 & @xmath162 & @xmath361 & @xmath362 & @xmath363 & @xmath364 +    the table includes a quantity @xmath339 , which in the case of a non - abelian symmetry is equal to the number of states in the abelian analysis required to get the same results as in the symmetry - adapted analysis .",
    "thus , for example , a calculation in which the full so(4 ) symmetry is preserved and in which a total of m=100 states are maintained in a block would require @xmath365 states for comparable accuracy when only the z - projection and the particle number are conserved .",
    "the table also indicates the computational effort required for these various calculations .",
    "keeping the same number of states in a calculation with full symmetry restoration as in a calculation with only additive symmetries increases the cost in cpu time very little , but yields an enormous improvement in accuracy .",
    "the results shown in table [ tablemg1 ] are for the the s=0 ground state of the system . calculations of higher spin states do not lead to as dramatic an improvement and cost savings .",
    "ccc basis & @xmath23 & @xmath340 + @xmath335 & @xmath366 & @xmath367 + @xmath336 & @xmath168 & @xmath368 + @xmath336 & @xmath369 & @xmath370 + @xmath336 & @xmath371 & @xmath372 + @xmath373 & @xmath374 & @xmath375 +    subsequently , the method was applied to the two - dimensional t - j model for lattices up to 24@xmath106 @xcite . here",
    "the purpose was no longer to simply assess the usefulness of symmetry restoration in the dmrg approach , but rather to use the power of the method to provide useful insight into this model of possible relevance to high-@xmath376 superconductors .",
    "in particular , it attempted to address the important , but controversial , issue of stripe formation in the t - j model .",
    "the analysis made use of the liang and pang approach to 2d lattices @xcite , which unrolls the 2d lattice onto a 1d lattice with long - range interactions .",
    "the calculations included up to @xmath377 states per block .",
    "an indication of the accuracy of the method is given in table [ tablemg2 ] , where the results obtained for a 16@xmath106 lattice with full spin conservation are compared with those having conserved spin projection only @xcite .",
    "as can be readily seen , the calculations with full su(2 ) spin conservation lead to significantly lower energies for comparable block sizes .",
    "the ground state emerges from this calculation in a two - stripe configuration , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "more recently , the method was applied to the problem of localized spin ordering in kondo lattice models @xcite . by exactly preserving spin symmetry in the problem ,",
    "the authors were able to directly measure the magnetization of the ground state and this made it possible for them to confirm the existence of a second ferromagnetic phase in the model @xcite , for which weak signals had been observed in a previous dmrg study that did not fully restore symmetries @xcite .",
    "in this review , we have described the current status of efforts to develop the density matrix renormalization group for application to finite fermi system .",
    "enormous progress has been made on this front and the method has indeed been applied with impressive success in several areas , especially in applications to quantum chemistry , to study the physics of ultrasmall superconducting grains and to study the properties of two - dimensional electron systems . along with these applications has come much work aimed at identifying the key issues that must be resolved in order to build an optimized dmrg algorithm for use in these and other systems .",
    "one of the most important issues concerns the optimal approach to ordering the single - particle basis states that are iteratively added by the dmrg algorithm .",
    "while important progress has been made , questions still remain and more work remains to be done .",
    "another area in which important progress has been made concerns the full incorporation of symmetries in the dmrg method .",
    "it is now possible to consistently incorporate non - abelian symmetries , such as rotational invariance , in addition to additive or abelian symmetries .",
    "early applications of the associated new methodology suggest that it permits increased accuracy in dmrg calculations , while requiring less cpu cost .",
    "more work along these lines is clearly warranted .",
    "another interesting point that has recently emerged concerns the usefulness of the dmrg method when treating weakly - coupled strongly - correlated subsystems .",
    "an application of the particle - hole dmrg method to tunnelling between ultrasmall superconducting grains suggests that the methodology breaks down when the tunnel coupling between the two grains is very weak .",
    "similar issues also arise when dealing with a set of single - particle levels that involve well - separated subsets ( _ e.g. _ shells ) , which are also very weakly coupled @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether the dmrg algorithm can be appropriately modified to handle such scenarios .",
    "a possibility might be to apply the dmrg separately to the various subsystems and then to couple them perturbatively .",
    "the issue of the ordering of levels for their optimal treatment within the dmrg method has recently led to the suggestion that quantum information theory might provide a useful handle on the problem .",
    "this connection needs further exploration .",
    "we have focussed our remarks on some of the most critical questions that have recently been raised in the context of the dmrg method as it applies to finite fermi systems and some of the most interesting methodological breakthroughs .",
    "as further progress is made to address these and other issues regarding the optimal protocol for dmrg studies , we expect a rapid increase in the number of applications .",
    "a potentially fertile area that has not yet been explored is the atomic nucleus .    in closing , we believe that the density matrix renormalization group method will continue to grow as a viable method for carrying out reliable and extremely accurate calculations for the properties of complex finite fermi systems , adding to the enormous history of success it has already achieved in the description of quantum lattices .",
    "we would like to express our appreciation to mario stoitsov , sevdalina dimitrova , german sierra , nicu sandulescu and larisa pacarescu , all of whom made important contributions to the dmrg projects on which we have worked .",
