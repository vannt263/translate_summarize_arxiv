    "by the infinite - dimensional unitary group we mean the inductive limit group @xmath6 .",
    "this group ( as well as any its topological completion ) is not locally compact and hence does not admit an invariant measure which is a necessary element for constructing the regular or biregular representation .",
    "nevertheless , there exists a 4-parameter family of unitary representations of @xmath7 which are reasonable analogs of the biregular representations of the pre - limit groups @xmath8 ( olshanski @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of harmonic analysis for @xmath0 in the formulation of @xcite consists in the decomposition of these `` generalized biregular representations '' of @xmath7 into a continuous integral of irreduciblle representations .",
    "as explained in @xcite , for nonexceptional values of the parameters , the decomposition problem can be reduced to the description of a certain family @xmath9 of probability measures which live on an infinite - dimensional space @xmath1 .",
    "the space @xmath1 , initially defined as a kind of a dual object to the group @xmath0 , can be identified with the boundary of the gelfand  tsetlin graph  a graded graph whose vertices of level @xmath10 represent the irreducible characters of @xmath11 and the graph structure reflects the branching rule of characters .",
    "each measure @xmath12 from our family is approximated by a canonical sequence @xmath13 of discrete probability measures , which are defined on the growing levels of the gelfand ",
    "tsetlin graph .",
    "we call the latter measures the _ zw - measures _ , and the limit measures @xmath12 on @xmath1 are called the _ boundary zw - measures_.    in borodin - olshanski @xcite it is shown that every boundary zw - measure @xmath12 can be turned into ( the law of ) a determinantal point process on the real line with two punctures , and the correlation kernel of that process can be explicitly computed : it is expressed in terms of the gauss hypergeometric function @xmath14 . at present , this is the only way to describe the boundary zw - measures @xmath12 .    the zw - measures @xmath15 on the levels of the gelfand ",
    "tsetlin graph play a fundamental role in the whole theory , because the only existing way to handle the boundary measures @xmath12 relies on the approximation @xmath16 .",
    "there is a remarkable similarity between the zw - measures and @xmath17 log - gas - type particle systems ( forrester @xcite ) arising in random matrix theory . here",

    "is it possible to go further and construct other deformations of the zw - measures , parallel to macdonald s @xmath19-deformation of the canonical scalar product in the algebra of symmetric functions ? in the present work , we get an affirmative answer for the simplest non - jack case , namely , for @xmath20 .    at",
    "first we believed that the desired @xmath3-analog of the zw - measures can be constructed with the use of the @xmath3-boundary of the gelfand - tselin graph  a concept , which was introduced in gorin @xcite and then successfully exploited in borodin - gorin @xcite . and indeed , we were able to do it for certain special values of the parameters corresponding to _ degenerate _ versions of the measures .",
    "however , in the case of general parameters , all our attempts failed .",
    "eventually we realized what was the cause of failure .",
    "it turned out that , for our purposes , the very notion of the gelfand - tsetlin graph is not suitable and has to be extended .",
    "the key idea of the definition of the _ extended gelfand  tsetlin graph _ is the following : the vertices of the ordinary gelfand - tsetlin graph can be identified with the finite point configurations on the one - dimensional lattice @xmath21 , which label irreducible representations of unitary groups . in the extended graph",
    ", the lattice @xmath22 has to be replaced by the _ double lattice _",
    "@xmath23 , which we identify with the double @xmath3-lattice of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are fixed parameters .",
    "the specific choice of parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 does not play a substantial role , the most important is that they are of opposite sign , so that the lattice lies on both sides of the zero in @xmath29 .",
    "the lattice @xmath30 comes from the askey scheme of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials ( see koekoek - swarttouw @xcite ) . as explained in @xcite , the pre - limit zw - measures are closely related to certain unnamed",
    "_ finite _ systems of orthogonal polynomials on @xmath22 ; in @xcite , we called them the _ askey - lesky polynomials_. it turns out that suitable @xmath3-analogs of the askey - lesky polynomials are the so - called _ pseudo big @xmath3-jacobi polynomials _ ( koornwinder @xcite ) . these polynomials are eigenfunctions of a second order @xmath3-difference operator @xmath31 ( a natural @xmath3-analog of the difference operator associated with the askey - lesky polynomials ) and they are orthogonal on @xmath30 .",
    "the idea to use the double lattice @xmath30 came to us when we became aware of the papers of groenevelt and koelink @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thanks to them we realized that @xmath31 admits a suitable selfadjoint version only when it is considered on a double lattice .      very briefly , the main results of the present paper are the following :    \\1 . _ the description of the @xmath3-boundary of the extended gelfand - tsetlin graph . _",
    "we show that the @xmath3-boundary can be identified with the space of two - sided bounded countable point configurations on the lattice @xmath30 . in the case of the ordinary gelfand  tsetlin graph , various approaches to the description of the ( @xmath3- ) boundary were devised in okounkov ",

    "the ensembles with different values of @xmath10 are linked to each other by means of certain canonical stochastic matrices associated with the graph .",

    "kernels of such a form as in , are called _ integrable _ ( in the sense of its - izergin - korepin - slavnov , see deift s survey paper @xcite ) .",
    "there are a lot of examples of integrable kernels coming from different models of random matrix theory and other sources , but the above kernel seems to be the first one which is expressed through basic hypergeometric functions .      in section [ sect2 ]",

    "we start with generalities concerning the notion of boundary that we need : it is defined as the set of extreme points of a projective limit of simplices .",
    "then we pass to our concrete situation where the simplices in question are spanned by the vertices from the levels of the extended gelfand  tsetlin graph and the maps between the simplices are given by the @xmath3-links .",
    "the description of the boundary is given in theorems [ thm1 ] , [ thm2 ] , [ thm3 ] , [ thm4 ] .",
    "together they constitute our first main result . at the end of the section we define the correlation functions for arbitrary probability measures on the boundary and",
    "show that they can be obtained , in principle , by a large-@xmath32 limit transition .",

    "we start with their definition .",

    "finally , we establish the coherency property of the pre - limit @xmath3-zw - measures ( theorem [ theorem_coherency ] ) .",

    "we compute the correlation kernels of the boundary @xmath3-zw - measures ( theorem [ theorem_ergodic ] ) .",

    "the computation is a bit tedious because we have to manipulate with long formulas , but it is quite elementary : the desired kernel is obtained by a direct limit transition in the @xmath32-th christoffel  darboux kernel for the pseudo big @xmath3-jacobi polynomials as @xmath36 .",

    "<S> the required decomposition is governed by certain probability measures on an infinite - dimensional space @xmath1 , which is a dual object to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> a way to describe those measures is to convert them into determinantal point processes on the real line ; it turned out that their correlation kernels are computable in explicit form  they admit a closed expression in terms of the gauss hypergeometric function @xmath2 ( borodin and olshanski , ann . </S>",

    "<S> this leads us to a new family of determinantal point processes . </S>",
    "<S> we reveal its connection with an exotic finite system of @xmath3-discrete orthogonal polynomials  the so - called pseudo big @xmath3-jacobi polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> the new point processes live on a double @xmath3-lattice and we show that their correlation kernels are expressed through the basic hypergeometric function @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> a crucial novel ingredient of our approach is an extended version @xmath5 of the gelfand - tsetlin graph ( the conventional graph describes the gelfand - tsetlin branching rule for irreducible representations of unitary groups ) . </S>",
