    "elasticity problem is an important branch of solid mechanics , which describes the changes of stress , strain , and displacement of the elastic medium by external factors .",
    "it is also the foundation of material mechanics , plastic mechanics and some interdisciplinary . since the elasticity problem is very complicated , so it is a challenge due to the huge computation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "many researchers studied the finite difference methods , finite element methods and some discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods .",
    "from the view of physics , the dg method is very natural to handle with the elasticity problem because dg method is locally conservative , stable , high order accurate and easily adaptive .",
    "the first dg method was introduced in @xcite by reed and hill for the hyperbolic equations , and then many dg methods were designed , one can refer @xcite .",
    "the dg methods for linear elasticity was firstly studied by @xcite , afterwards , a local discontinuous galerkin ( ldg ) method for linear elasticity problem is developed in @xcite .",
    "cai and ye presented a kind of mixed discontinuous finite element method in @xcite . besides , rivire , shaw and wheeler introduced a standard dg scheme for linear elasticity in @xcite .",
    "houston and schtzau gave an adaptive mixed dg method for nearly incompressible linear elasticity in @xcite .",
    "however , the above mentioned methods mainly consider the order of error estimates depending on @xmath1 for the linear elasticity problem . in the work ,",
    "we propose absolutely stable hp dg methods for the elasticity problem , which are different from the general dg methods , and we prove the optimal order of convergence in the energy norm and @xmath0-norm by the superpenalization technique .",
    "the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows . in section 2 , we introduce some notations and the model problem . in section 3 , we derive the new hp dg methods for the elasticity problem and prove the stability of the methods . in section 4 ,",
    "we prove the optimal order of convergence of our methods for the elasticity problem in the energy norm and @xmath0-norm .",
    "finally , we give a numerical example to illustrate the performance of our theoretical results .",
    "in the paper , we consider the following elasticity problem : @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) is a convex polygonal domain with @xmath6 , and the stress tensor @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the identity tensor , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a fourth - order tensor satisfying the symmetric property : @xmath12 .",
