    "the single band hubbard hamiltonian@xcite captures several of the most fundamental consequences of electron - electron interactions in solids , namely magnetic order and the mott metal - insulator transition .",
    "although the question is still open , it may even contain the fundamental physics of @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the cuprates@xcite .",
    "multi - band hamiltonians like the periodic anderson model ( pam ) @xcite examine what happens when two species of electrons , one delocalized ` conduction ' band ( often @xmath0 ) , and another localized band ( often @xmath1 ) are present . here",
    "a central effect is the competition between singlet formation@xcite , when the conduction and localized electrons are strongly hybridized , and ordering of the local moments mediated indirectly through the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida interaction@xcite .    in heavy fermion materials@xcite ,",
    "this competition is believed to explain different low temperature phases , e.g.  non - magnetic ceal@xmath2 where the @xmath1 moments are screened by the conduction electrons , and ceal@xmath3 which becomes antiferromagnetic ( af ) at low temperatures .",
    "likewise , in ce metal itself , as well as in other rare - earths , the tuning of the @xmath1-@xmath0 hybridization @xmath4 through pressure is believed to play a crucial role in the ` volume collapse ' transition@xcite .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) studies of the pam have explored some of this physics , in one@xcite , two@xcite , and three dimensions@xcite .",
    "the focus has been on bipartite lattices which , at half - filling , host af order without frustration and are also free of the fermion sign problem@xcite .",
    "qmc in infinite dimensions@xcite complements work in finite @xmath0 by allowing simulations at very low temperature , at or even well below the kondo scale , at the expense of some of the knowledge of correlations in space .",
    "there is interest in understanding the magnetic correlations in more general geometries .",
    "one such modification allows for intersite , rather than on - site , hybridization between conduction and local orbitals and hence metallic behavior in the absence of interactions@xcite .",
    "another motivation is provided by chemical substitution in heavy fermion materials , either by the replacement of some of the local moment atoms by non - magnetic ones , as in ( ce , la)coin@xmath5@xcite or by changes to the conduction orbitals , as in the alloying of cd onto in sites in ceco(in , cd)@xmath5 @xcite . in the latter situation , @xmath4 is reduced locally , and af droplets can form around the impurity sites .",
    "a second motivation is the recent observation of a quantum critical state in magnetic quasicrystals@xcite . in these au - al - yb alloys ( au@xmath6al@xmath7yb@xmath8 ) ,",
    "measurements of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath9 and specific heat @xmath10 diverge as @xmath11 .",
    "this non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior is associated with strongly correlated @xmath12 yb electrons .",
    "these two sets of materials share a common feature which is that the coordination number of the different atoms is no longer spatially uniform .",
    "the effects of these unique local environments can be probed with nuclear magnetic resonance@xcite .",
    "the nfl behavior of au - al - yb alloys has recently been studied by solving the @xmath13 anderson impurity model ( aim ) for a single local moment coupled to conduction electrons in a quasicrystal approximant geometry@xcite .",
    "the crucial result is that singular responses in @xmath9 and @xmath10 occur as a consequence of a broad ( power law ) distribution of kondo temperatures which delays screening of a large fraction of the magnetic moments until very low temperatures .    in this paper",
    "we study the pam in two different geometries : the lieb lattice and a 2d  ammann - beenker \" tiling@xcite .",
    "quasicrystaline approximates@xcite for au@xmath6al@xmath7yb@xmath8 are in 3d ; the quasi - periodic ammann - beenker tiling is a more tractable 2d alternative for qmc , which is limited in the number of sites which can be simulated .",
    "our goal is to explore the nature of magnetic correlations as a function of @xmath1-@xmath0 hybridization , and , specifically , to understand the competition of antiferromagnetic order and singlet formation in geometries where the coordination number of different sites in the lattice is non - uniform .",
    "our work extends that of @xcite by examining a dense array of local orbitals and also by including the effect of finite @xmath14 .",
    "we begin with the lieb lattice , because it contains two separate coordination numbers , @xmath15 while still retaining very simple lattice periodicity .",
    "we then turn to the more complicated quasicrystal approximant structure .",
    "we do not at present address the anomalous nfl behavior of the magnetic susceptibility , since those phenomena appear to be associated only with the quasicrystal itself , and not its approximant@xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of quantum antiferromagnets in geometries which have variable coordination number ( the crown , dice , and cavo lattices ) have also been studied in the context of the spin-1/2 heisenberg hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , unlike the case of regular geometries where the ordered moment _ increases _ from the honeycomb ( @xmath16 ) to square ( @xmath17 ) lattices , it is found that the local af order parameter",
    "_ decreases _ with @xmath18 .",
    "we will comment on this further in our conclusions .",
