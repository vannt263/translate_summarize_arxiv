    "the imf connects a variety of astrophysical phenomena including star formation , stellar feedback , the relative number of stellar remnants , and heavy element production , and is a critical ingredient in modeling the integrated light from distant galaxies .",

    "unfortunately , the imf is very difficult to measure when individual stars can not be resolved , owing to the intrinsic faintness of lower main sequence stars relative to the evolved giants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the emerging consensus is that the imf appears to vary systematically from a milky way - like imf @xcite at lower galaxy masses to a @xcite imf , or even more bottom - heavy imf , for the most massive galaxies .",
    "this consensus is not without challenges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "at the same time , evidence has emerged that the imf may vary strongly within galaxies , at least at high masses @xcite .",
    "not all authors find evidence for radial variation in the imf @xcite , though it is not clear if the different conclusions are due to small sample sizes or the analysis techniques .",
    "the existence of strong imf gradients implies that direct comparison between different techniques requires careful consideration of aperture effects .    when inferring the imf from the depth of stellar absorption lines , all analyses to date have focused on parameterized imfs , e.g. , a single power - law or a broken power - law , with a fixed low - mass cutoff .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have combined stellar population and dynamical constraints for individual galaxies in order to place stronger constraints on the shape of the imf .    here",
    "we go one step further and attempt to constrain the general form of the imf directly from the absorption line spectra of old stellar systems .",

    "our goals are 1 ) to assess what is measurable from absorption line spectra in the idealized limit of perfect models , and 2 ) to reconstruct from real data the imf under different assumptions and assess how the derived mass - to - light ratio depends on these assumptions .",
    "our approach to constructing stellar population models follows ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cvd12a ) , with several important updates .",
    "first and foremost , the models now span a wider range of ages and metallicities , with ages extending from @xmath4 gyr and metallicities from [ z / h]=-1.5 to [ z / h]=+0.25 .",
    "second , we now adopt the mist stellar isochrones @xcite which obviate the need to stitch together various isochrone databases as done in cvd12a .",
    "third , we have obtained irtf nir spectra for 283 stars from the miles spectral library @xcite , providing continuous spectral coverage from @xmath5 for stars with well - known stellar parameters over a wide range in metallicity .",
    "the details of the new library are presented in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the new library , we have created a polynomial spectral interpolator that provides stellar spectra for arbitrary @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and [ z / h ] , the details of which are presented in @xcite .",
    "we include the library of m dwarfs from @xcite to more fully population the cool dwarf regime for the purposes of constraining the interpolator .",
    "fourth , the theoretical response functions , which are computed from the atlas and synthe model atmosphere and spectrum synthesis package @xcite , have been recomputed with updated atomic and molecular data and for stellar parameters covering the full age and metallicity range of the new models .",
    "the element response functions are then tabulated as a function of age and metallicity assuming a kroupa imf .",
    "we have checked that the derived mass - to - light ratios do not change substantially if the response functions are instead computed with a salpeter imf ( but see * ? ? ? * for an example where this choice may affect the nir na@xmath8i lines at @xmath9 ) .",
    "the methodology for fitting models to data is similar to the approach described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "namely , we employ a markov chain monte carlo algorithm @xcite in order to sample the posteriors of the following parameters : redshift and velocity dispersion , a two component star formation history ( two bursts with free ages and relative mass contribution ) , the overall metallicity , [ z / h ] , 18 individual elements ( though many are irrelevant from the standpoint of the imf , e.g. , sr and ba ) , the strengths of five emission line groups ( including the balmer lines which are assumed to have relative line strengths determined by case b recombination ) , a hot star component with @xmath6 that can vary from 8,000k to 30,000k , and imf parameters described below .",
    "in addition , we fit for several data - related systematics , including a a multiplicative factor applied to the observed errors , a sky emission spectrum that is used to increase the errors specifically around sky lines , and a telluric absorption spectrum , whose overall strength is a free parameter . the parameters affecting the observed errors are given a penalty in the likelihood calculation in order to discourage the fitter from inflating the errors to be arbitrarily high .",
    "mismatch between the observed and model continuum shape is treated by fitting a polynomial to the ratio of the model and data .",
    "this polynomial is recomputed for each likelihood evaluation .      in all models in this work the imf slope above @xmath10",
    "is assumed to have the @xcite value of 2.35 , the upper mass limit is @xmath11 and stellar remnants are included in the final mass calculation following @xcite .",
    "we explore three options for the parameterization of the imf .",
    "the first option has two free parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , corresponding to the logarithmic slope of the imf ( @xmath14 ) over the mass intervals @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in this first option",
    "the low - mass cutoff is fixed to @xmath17 .",
    "grids of models were pre - tabulated with @xmath18 ranging from @xmath19 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "option two is the same as option one except that the low - mass cutoff , @xmath20 is a free parameter .",
    "pre - computed grids were made for @xmath21 .",
    "option three is a non - parametric imf .",
    "we have pre - computed what we call `` partial ssps '' ( simple stellar populations ) , which are ssps computed within a bin in stellar mass of width @xmath22 from @xmath23 , and @xmath24 for the lowest mass bin .",
    "one must still choose the imf weighting within each bin ; for this work we adopt a salpeter imf intra - bin weighting because direct measurements of the imf are consistent with salpeter - like slopes , at least for @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we will also consider kroupa - like intra - bin weighting to explore the impact of this assumption . in a more general treatment",
    "the intra - bin weighting would be an additional free parameter . in order to keep the number of free parameters manageable ,",
    "we only explicitly include five parameters in the model for the bins starting at 0.08 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 and 0.9@xmath26 .",
    "the weights for the other bins are computed via linear interpolation between the fitted bins .",
    "we emphasize that all bins contribute to the final model and hence to the @xmath27 minimization .",
    "the overall normalization has no effect on the spectrum nor the mass - to - light ratio , so to further decrease the number of free parameters we have fixed the weight for the highest - mass bin to 1.0 .",
    "this leaves four free parameters for the non - parametric imf option .",
    "finally , we adopt a regularization procedure in order to ensure that the final imf is smooth .",
    "the prior requires that the logarithmic slope of the imf between two mass bins can not change from negative to positive when moving from lower to higher masses ( e.g. , if the logarithmic slope in the @xmath28 bin is negative while the slope in the @xmath29 bin is positive , then the prior on that point in parameter space is set to 0.0 ) .",

    "the sensitivity of various features to surface gravity and temperature is strong throughout the entire wavelength range ( see also cvd12a ) .",
    "the middle and bottom panels show the percentage change to the full ssp model when doubling the weight assigned to each mass bin , assuming a fiducial salpeter imf . unsurprisingly",
    ", the lowest mass bins contribute very little flux in the blue , which is why the nir spectral range is critical for robust constraints on the low mass imf .",
    "in this section we explore the extent to which the imf and @xmath39band mass - to - light ratio , @xmath30 , can be recovered from mock data ( in this paper mass - to - light ratios are quoted in units of @xmath40 ) .",
    "we create mock spectra with a fixed s / n per  over the wavelength range @xmath41 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath42 ( these characteristics were chosen to be similar to the observations discussed in the following section ) . in all cases the age is fixed to 10 gyr , the metallicity is [ z / h]=0.0 , with solar - scaled abundance patterns , and the various nuisance parameters are set to zero .",

    "the contribution to the total flux from the lowest mass bins is very small , and so the non - parametric imf recovery is biased low , a consequence of the very wide priors on the individual imf weights .",
    "however , the very fact that these low - mass bins contribute very little to the light and so are difficult to constrain also implies that they contribute little to the mass . as an example , the bias shown in the upper left panel results in only a 16% bias in the recovered @xmath30    we explore the @xmath30 ratios explicitly in figure [ fig : mlr ] .",

    "results at s / n@xmath52 tend to be biased low when the low - mass cutoff is @xmath53 .",

    "the results are never biased by more than 10% for the input models explored here .    another important conclusion to draw from figure [ fig : mlr ]",

    "this is important and suggests that the @xmath56 parameter is a reliable , compact metric for imf measurements .",

    "<S> these results provide strong evidence for the existence of extreme ( super - salpeter ) imfs in the cores of massive galaxies . </S>"
