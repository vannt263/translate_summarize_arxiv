    "we consider a function @xmath0 of the variables @xmath1 that is twice continuously differentiable ( @xmath2 ) over an open set containing the compact set @xmath3 . because @xmath4 is @xmath2 over @xmath3 , its first and second derivatives on",

    "while one may generalize this pattern to even higher orders , we will content ourselves with the linear and quadratic cases as we believe these to be sufficient for most applications ",

    "to limit our analysis to a single dimension , we will consider the line segment between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "as @xmath4 is @xmath2 , it follows that @xmath21 is as well , which allows us to use the taylor series expansion between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , together with the mean - value theorem @xcite , to state :    @xmath24    for some @xmath25 .",
    "we proceed to define the first - order derivative in terms of the original function @xmath4 .",
    "to do this we apply the chain rule :    @xmath26    noting that @xmath27 and @xmath28 , one may substitute ( [ eq : lproof3 ] ) into ( [ eq : lproof2 ] ) to obtain    @xmath29    because @xmath30 , we may use ( [ eq : lip1 ] ) to bound the individual summation components as    @xmath31    or , to account for both cases , as    @xmath32 \\leq \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i } \\big |_{x ( \\tilde \\gamma ) } ( x_{b , i } - x_{a , i } ) \\\\",

    "the derivation is similar to that of the linear case , and simply involves taking the taylor series expansion one degree higher , with    @xmath33    for some @xmath25 . applying the chain rule    @xmath34    and then differentiating once more with respect to @xmath35 yields    @xmath36    where we have ignored the terms corresponding to @xmath37 as all such terms are 0 . applying the chain rule again yields    @xmath38    substituting the results of ( [ eq : qproof3 ] ) and ( [ eq : qproof5 ] ) into ( [ eq : qproof2 ] ) , noting that @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and rearranging then leads to    @xmath39    the bounds on the quadratic term are derived in a manner analogous to what was done in the linear case :    @xmath40    and ,",

    "this globality may , however , add unnecessary conservatism and thus motivate local relaxations @xcite .",
    "noting that the derivations of the bounds only require them to be valid on the line between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , let us define the local lipschitz constants with respect to these two points in particular as                        c. cartis , j. m. fowkes , and n. i. m. gould ( 2013 ) . branching and bounding improvements for global optimization algorithms with lipschitz continuity properties .",
