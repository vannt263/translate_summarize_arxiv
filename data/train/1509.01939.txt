    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) play a central role in the life of our own and other galaxies , as they are the sites where essentially all star formation occurs .",
    "for this reason , the study of the formation and evolution of gmcs is a highly important topic .",
    "however , this study is hampered by the fact that the two main constituents of the gas making up a gmc  molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) and atomic helium  do not emit radiation at the low gas temperatures present in most gmcs . in order to study the molecular gas",
    ", it is therefore necessary to observe emission from less abundant chemical species that do emit at low temperatures and that are correlated with the h@xmath0 distribution .",
    "one of the most popular such tracer species is carbon monoxide ( co ) .",
    "this has several advantages as a tracer of molecular gas .",
    "first , there is a lot of it in most gmcs : it is typically the second most abundant molecular species , after h@xmath0 .",
    "second , it emits readily at low temperatures : the energy separation between the rotational ground state ( @xmath4 ) and the first rotationally excited level ( @xmath5 ) is only 5.5  k. in addition , the main chemical pathways that lead to the formation of co in the interstellar medium all involve h@xmath0 as a key ingredient at some point ( see e.g.the detailed discussion of co formation chemistry in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and so we would not expect large amounts of co to form in regions devoid of h@xmath0 .",
    "observationally , co emission has indeed proved to be a good tracer of molecular gas within the milky way .",
    "a number of different studies , summarized in the recent review by @xcite , have shown that on scales comparable to or larger than individual gmcs there is a good correlation between the velocity - integrated intensity in the @xmath6 line of @xmath7co and the h@xmath0 column density . the conversion factor from integrated intensity to column density  the so - called x - factor  is given approximately by @xmath8 for milky way gmcs , and similar values are also found for other nearby , milky way - like disk galaxies .",
    "simulations of gmcs in environments similar to that of the local ism typically yield values for @xmath3 close to this observationally determined value ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". its lack of significant variation from cloud to cloud can be understood as a consequence of the fact that the main cloud properties that determine @xmath3 in metal - rich galaxies  the velocity dispersion , the temperature and the surface density of the gas  do not vary much from cloud to cloud @xcite .",
    "however , in low metallicity systems such as dwarf galaxies , co is much less useful as a tracer of molecular gas .",
    "a growing number of observational studies have provided evidence that @xmath3 increases substantially as the metallicity decreases ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , owing to the reduction in the mean extinction of the molecular gas ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulations also suggest that the @xmath3 may become strongly time - dependent at low metallicity ( @xcite ; see also section  [ sec : time_evol ] below ) .",
    "furthermore , co has proved to be extremely difficult to detect in very low metallicity systems : at @xmath9 , there are secure detections of co in only two systems , the wolf - lundmark - melotte and sextans a dwarf galaxies @xcite .    in view of the difficulties involved with using co as a tracer of molecular gas in metal - poor galaxies",
    ", it is natural to ask whether there are better tracers that we might use .",
    "one interesting possibility is neutral atomic carbon , c. this produces two fine structure lines in its electronic ground state , the @xmath10 transition at 609@xmath11 m and the @xmath12 transition at 370@xmath11 m .",
    "its potential as a tracer of molecular gas was championed by @xcite , who pointed out that although simple pdr models predict that it will be confined to a thin transition region at the edge of molecular clouds ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , observations do not bear this out , and have long shown that c and co emission are surprisingly well correlated in local clouds @xcite .",
    "this behaviour can be understood as a consequence of clumpy substructure within molecular clouds : co emission comes primarily from within clumps and filaments , while [ ci ]  emission traces their surfaces , but since the typical scale of the structures is small and there are often many along each line of sight , the result is that the projected co and [ ci ]  emission are well - correlated , both spatially and also in terms of velocity @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have explored the usefulness of atomic carbon as a molecular gas tracer in solar metallicity clouds .",
    "they used the 3d - pdr code @xcite to post - process simulations of turbulent molecular clouds , allowing them to predict the chemical composition and temperature of the gas at each point in the cloud .",
    "based on this , they then computed synthetic emission maps for the 609@xmath11 m of [ ci ]  and the @xmath6 transition of co , using the radmc-3d radiation transfer code.dullemond/software/radmc-3d/ ] they found that [ ci ]  emission was indeed a good tracer of h@xmath0 column density in their model clouds .",
    "they also computed a mean [ ci]-to - h@xmath0 conversion factor , @xmath1 , for their models , and showed that @xmath13 for a cloud with solar metallicity illuminated by the standard interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , and @xmath14 for a solar metallicity cloud illuminated by a ten times stronger isrf .",
    "however , @xcite did not explore whether @xmath1 is sensitive to the metallicity of the gas .",
    "in addition , there are a couple of inconsistencies in the @xcite approach that may influence their results .",
    "firstly , they perform their hydrodynamical simulations assuming an isothermal equation of state @xcite , and only solve for the actual temperature distribution during the later post - processing step .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation in dense , well - shielded gas , but not in the lower density , moderately shielded gas where atomic carbon dominates ( c.f .  their figures 6 and 7 ) .",
    "secondly , they evolve the chemistry for a period of 10  myr , but stop the hydrodynamical simulation after @xmath15 .",
    "they may therefore miss important non - equilibrium effects in the chemistry .    in @xcite  ( 2015 ; hereafter , paper i ) , we presented results from a study of the [ ci ]  emission produced by a model of a turbulent molecular cloud that does not suffer from these inconsistencies . in our simulation , we evolved the chemistry and internal energy of the gas simultaneously with the hydrodynamics , allowing us to capture any influence of the non - isothermal equation of state on the dynamical evolution and to ensure that the chemistry is not evolved for a longer period of time than the dynamics .",
    "the cloud that we modeled in paper i had a solar metallicity , and was illuminated by the standard @xcite ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation field .",
    "we found , in agreement with @xcite , that the [ ci ]  emission line was a good tracer of the molecular mass of the cloud . in the present paper ,",
    "we extend this study by examining clouds with a range of different metallicities . for each metallicity",
    ", we run models with several different values for the strength of the isrf .",
    "our goal is to understand how well [ ci ]  emission can be used as a tracer of molecular gas in this wider range of systems , and whether it becomes clearly superior to co at low metallicities . since clouds in extragalactic systems are typically unresolved or only marginally resolved , our main focus in this study is on how @xmath1 varies as a function of metallicity , radiation field strength and time .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in section  [ method ] , we outline the numerical method used to perform our simulations and to post - process the results .",
    "we also give details of the initial conditions that we used for our simulations . in section",
    "[ result ] , we present and discuss our results . finally , we conclude in section  [ conc ] .",
    "to model the chemical , thermal and dynamical evolution of the gas in our model clouds , we use a modified version of the gadget 2 sph code @xcite .",
    "our modified version of the code includes a simplified chemical model that follows the abundances of h , h@xmath0 , h@xmath16 , c , c@xmath16 , co , hco@xmath16 , he , he@xmath16 , and free electrons @xcite , a detailed cooling function , and a treatment of the effects of attenuation of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) based on the treecol algorithm @xcite . to model gravitationally",
    "collapsing regions that become too small to resolve , we use a sink particle algorithm based on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the version of the code used here is the same as that used in paper i , and a more extensive discussion of its capabilities can be found in that paper .",
    "although our use of a simplified chemical network introduces some uncertainty into our results that would not be present if we used a more extensive network , the impact of this on our predicted c and co abundances is likely to be small .",
    "we showed in an earlier paper @xcite that the simplified chemical network that we use in this study produces comparable results for the c and co distributions to the larger @xcite network .",
    "that network was in turn benchmarked against an extensive model derived from the umist astrochemical database @xcite and shown to produce results in good agreement with the latter for a range of different physical conditions .",
    "in addition , the fact that our results agree well with those of @xcite , who make use of a chemical network containing over 200 species and several thousand reactions , also gives us confidence that our use of a simplified network is not a major source of error .",
    "we construct synthetic emission maps of our simulated clouds in the @xmath10 fine structure line of [ ci ]  ( hereafter simply referred to as the [ ci ]  @xmath17 line ) and the @xmath6 line of @xmath7co using the radmc-3d radiation transfer code .",
    "the region modelled with radmc-3d is a cubical sub - volume of the cloud , with a side length of 16.2  pc that contains almost all of the co and neutral atomic carbon present in the model clouds . before feeding our data to radmc-3d , we first interpolate it onto a cartesian grid with a resolution of @xmath18 zones . in paper",
    "i we explored the effect of varying this resolution and showed that @xmath18 zones was sufficient to fully resolve the [ ci ]  emission .",
    "to compute the level populations required by the code , we used the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation .",
    "the implementation of this approximation within radmc-3d is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we fixed the velocity resolution of the code at @xmath19 and accounted for small - scale unresolved velocity fluctuations by including a microturbulent contribution to the linewidth with size @xmath20 .",
    "however , the values that we derived for the [ ci ]  and co velocity - integrated intensities are relatively insensitive to these choices .",
    "our default initial conditions in this study are similar to those used in paper i and in several other previous papers ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cloud mass is @xmath21 , and the cloud is simulated using two million sph particles .",
    "the resulting mass resolution is @xmath22 . in paper",
    "i , we explored the effects of increasing this resolution , but found that this resulted in only minor differences in the [ ci ]  emission produced by the cloud .",
    "the cloud was initially spherical , with a radius of 6.3  pc .",
    "the initial h nuclei number density of the gas was @xmath23 , within a factor of two of the median value determined for local gmcs by @xcite .",
    "the initial gas temperature was @xmath24 and the initial dust temperature was @xmath25 . and @xmath26 rapidly adjust to close to their thermal equilibrium values following the beginning of the simulations , our results do not depend on these starting values . ]",
    "the velocity field of the gas in the clouds was constructed as a gaussian random field , with a power spectrum @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the wavenumber .",
    "the amplitude of the velocity fluctuations was constrained to yield an initial rms velocity of @xmath29 .",
    "this value was chosen so that the initial kinetic energy of the cloud was equal to its gravitational binding energy .",
    "the velocity field was then allowed to evolve during the simulation without any further kinetic energy input .",
    "the cloud was simulated using vacuum boundary conditions , but the artificial `` evaporation '' of material from the edge of the cloud was prevented by the application of an external pressure term @xcite .",
    "we performed a series of simulations using these initial conditions , and varying the metallicity of the gas and the strength of the imposed radiation field .",
    "the values used in the different simulations are summarized in table  [ tab : sims ] . in our solar metallicity simulations ,",
    "the total abundances of carbon and oxygen relative to hydrogen were taken to be @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively @xcite . in the lower metallicity simulations ,",
    "these values were scaled by a factor @xmath32 . in most of our simulations , we also assumed that the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath33 scaled as @xmath32 .",
    "however , there is some observational evidence that it actually falls off more rapidly as the metallicity decreases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and so we also performed three simulations ( z05-g1-d0375 , z02-g1-d01 and z01-g1-d001 ) in which we adopted smaller dust - to - gas ratios . for simplicity , we neglect any effects arising due to changes in the size distribution or composition of the dust as we change the metallicity and dust - to - gas ratio . in all of our simulations ,",
    "the oxygen and hydrogen were assumed to begin in neutral atomic form , and the carbon was assumed to start as c@xmath16 .",
    "the spectral shape of our adopted interstellar radiation field follows @xcite in the ultraviolet and @xcite at longer wavelengths .",
    "we consider several different radiation field strengths , quantified by the parameter @xmath34 which is normalized so that @xmath35 corresponds to the @xcite radiation field . in our treecol - based treatment of the attenuation of the radiation field",
    ", we used a total of 48 pixels to represent the angular variation of the radiation field around each sph particle . in paper",
    "i , we verified that this was sufficient to yield well - converged results . in most of our runs",
    ", we adopted a cosmic ray ionization rate for atomic hydrogen given by @xmath36 .",
    "however , we also carried out a few simulations with larger values of @xmath37 .",
    "cosmic ray ionization rates for h@xmath0 , co etc .  were computed by scaling the h ionization rates , as described in @xcite .",
    ".list of simulations [ tab : sims ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath3 is given in units of the galactic co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor @xmath38 ( see eq .  [ xcomw ] ) and is computed for @xmath39 .",
    "we have carried out this analysis for three of our cloud models , z1-g1 , z02-g1 and z003-g1 , chosen to span the full range of metallicities examined in this study .",
    "we list the resulting values of @xmath3 in table  [ tab : freeze ] , along with the values that we obtain in the absence of freeze - out .",
    "we see that at solar metallicity , freeze - out has a negligible effect on the predicted value of @xmath3 .",
    "this is easy to understand , as by the time we reach the densities at which co freeze - out becomes significant , the gas is highly optically thick in the @xmath7co @xmath17 line . because the line is optically thick , removing even a large fraction of the co has little effect on the total emission ( provided that @xmath40 remains greater than one ) , and hence little effect on @xmath3 .",
    "as we reduce the metallicity , we find that freeze - out starts to have a greater effect on @xmath3 .",
    "again , this is easy to understand : at lower @xmath41 , we have much less co and hence the optical depth of the line is much smaller , making it more sensitive to the actual co abundance . on the other hand , reducing the dust - to - gas ratio , which is assumed in these models to scale with z ,",
    "reduces the freeze - out rate , since there is less dust for the co molecules to freeze out onto .",
    "consequently , in the lower metallicity models , the density at which @xmath42 is much higher than in run z1-g1 . as a result ,",
    "freeze - out remains relatively unimportant in these models despite the lower optical depths , increasing @xmath3 by at most 30% .",
    "finally , what about the other simulations studied in this paper ? in the other runs with @xmath35 , we would expect to recover results intermediate between the z1-g1 and z003-g1 results , with the precise behaviour depending on the metallicity . in the runs with reduced dust - to - gas ratio",
    ", the effects of freeze - out will be smaller , since @xmath43 . in the runs with @xmath44 or 100",
    ", we would again expect the effects of freeze - out to be smaller , since the dust will be warmer , making @xmath45 larger .",
    "finally , in the runs with elevated cosmic ray ionization rates , @xmath46 will be larger , and so once again we will have less freeze - out .",
    "therefore , it seems safe to conclude that the freeze - out of co onto dust will not strongly affect the results we recover for the behaviour of @xmath3 in any of our cloud models .",
    "real molecular clouds are known to be magnetized ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we carry out our simulations using a purely hydrodynamical approach , in view of the technical difficulties involved in modeling magnetized gas with smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( see the lengthy discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the question therefore arises as to how much this is likely to affect our results .    we know from previous simulations of turbulent molecular clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that prior to the onset of runaway gravitational collapse , the width of the volume density and column density pdfs are sensitive to the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "increasing the field strength provides additional resistance against compression or rarefaction and leads to a narrower volume density pdf .",
    "projection of this into two dimensions then leads in turn to a narrower column density pdf .",
    "the extent to which this will affect @xmath1 and @xmath3 will then depend on the size of the characteristic column density ( or visual extinction ) at which we find the transition from c@xmath16 to c or from c to co. if this column density is comparable to or smaller than the mean column density of the cloud , then a significant fraction of the gas will be [ ci ]  or co rich , regardless of whether we consider a magnetized or unmagnetized cloud . in this case , we would expect the values of @xmath1 and @xmath3 to be insensitive to the magnetic field strength .",
    "similarly , if the required column density is so large that it is reached only in regions that go into runaway gravitational collapse ( as in e.g.  our low metallicity runs ) , then the amount of c and co that form in the cloud will be insensitive to the width of the turbulence - dominated density pdf , implying that @xmath1 and @xmath3 will also not vary much .",
    "the only case in which the difference in the width of the pdf is likely to have a large effect is if the characteristic column density is such that it is 12 standard deviations above the mean in the unmagnetized cloud , but multiple standard deviations above the mean in the magnetized cloud , owing to the change in the size of the standard deviation . in this case",
    ", we would go from predicting that the cloud is [ ci ]  and co - rich in the unmagnetized case to predicting that it is [ ci ]  and co - poor in the magnetized case .",
    "however , such a situation will rarely be encountered in practice , as magnetic fields of the level observed in most gmcs do not make a large difference to the width of the column density pdf .",
    "we therefore expect that accounting for this effect may lead to minor changes in our results at intermediate metallicities , but that it will not greatly change our main conclusions regarding the utility of [ ci ]  and co as tracers of molecular gas",
    ".    the other potentially important effect of the magnetic field will be to suppress the gravitational collapse of dense regions , if they are magnetically sub - critical .",
    "this can have a large effect on @xmath3 in low metallicity clouds : if gravitational collapse is suppressed , the gas will never become co - bright , and so @xmath3 will remain large .",
    "clouds that are so magnetically dominated that they remain starless for long periods will therefore also remain invisible in co for long periods . in this circumstance , [ ci ]  will clearly be a much better tracer of the clouds .",
    "however , it should also be noted that the importance of this effect is unclear .",
    "measurements of the magnetic field strength in dense prestellar cores in local molecular clouds suggest that these cores are generally magnetically supercritical , and hence that gravitational collapse is not strongly suppressed @xcite .",
    "whether the same holds true for dense clouds in much lower metallicity environments is unknown .",
    "our simulations do not account for the effects of stellar feedback .",
    "because of this , we can not explore how @xmath1 and @xmath3 evolve over the entire lifetime of one of our simulated clouds , as without feedback , there is nothing to stop the whole of the gas eventually being converted to stars .",
    "we have therefore focussed primarily on their evolution prior to the onset of star formation ( i.e.  at @xmath47 ) , when stellar feedback is , by definition , completely absent .",
    "however , in section  [ sec : time_evol ] we did investigate how @xmath3 and @xmath1 evolved in the interval between @xmath39 and @xmath48 in a few of our simulations , and it is therefore important to note that our results for this regime may be affected by our neglect of feedback .",
    "the importance of feedback during this period will depend on the star formation rate of the clouds and how much of the dense , co - bright gas is actively forming stars .",
    "for example , in run z1-g1 , the star formation efficiency of the cloud at @xmath48 is only around 0.3% , and much of the co is located in gas which is too diffuse to be actively star - forming . in this cloud",
    ", we would not expect the evolution of @xmath3 and @xmath1 at @xmath49 to have yet been strongly affected by stellar feedback . on the other hand , in run z003-g100 ,",
    "the star formation efficiency of the cloud at @xmath48 is around 7.8% , more than an order of magnitude larger than in the solar metallicity case .",
    "this difference in star formation efficiency is a consequence of the different thermal structure of the two clouds .",
    "the gas in the low metallicity , strongly irradiated cloud is significantly warmer than the gas in the solar metallicity cloud .",
    "this means that it takes longer to form a dense core which is sufficiently massive to be self - gravitating ( see table  [ tab : tsf ] ) , but also that once such a core has formed , it is able to form a lot of stars relatively rapidly . because of the high instantaneous star formation rate in this cloud , and the fact that all of the co is located in a single dense core , it is plausible that if we were to include the effects of stellar feedback , much of the co would be destroyed . in this case , the period during which the cloud is co - bright would be even more short - lived that we find in our simulations .",
    "however , confirmation of this requires simulations that do account for the effects of stellar feedback , which are out of the scope of our present study .",
    "the most important point to take away from this study is that the usefulness of [ ci ]  emission as a tracer of h@xmath0 mass in low metallicity clouds depends strongly on the evolutionary state of the clouds . at early times ,",
    "prior to the onset of gravitational collapse in the cloud , [ ci ]  is a far better tracer of h@xmath0 than co. the [ ci]-to - h@xmath0 conversion factor , @xmath1 , is not constant  it varies with the metallicity roughly as @xmath50@xmath51 for metallicities in the range @xmath52  but it is far less sensitive to changes in the metallicity than co , which is an extremely ineffective tracer of molecular mass in starless clouds at low metallicity .    shortly before the onset of star formation , however , co becomes a much better tracer of the molecular mass . at @xmath39 , both @xmath3 and @xmath1 scale approximately with metallicity as @xmath53 , but",
    "@xmath3 is consistently smaller than @xmath1 , by a factor ranging from a few to an order of magnitude .",
    "since it is much easier to observe the @xmath7co @xmath6 line in terrestrial conditions than the [ ci ]  609@xmath54 m line , the conclusion we draw from this is that at redshifts close to zero , co should be preferred to [ ci ]  as a tracer of the h@xmath0 mass of star - forming clouds in low metallicity systems.ii ] 158@xmath54 m fine structure line is an even better tracer of h@xmath0 in these systems ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this topic lies outside of the scope of this paper . ] at higher redshifts , however , the [ ci ]  609@xmath54 m line becomes much easier to observe from the ground , and in this case [ ci ]  can become competitive with co as a tracer of molecular gas in metal - poor star - forming systems @xcite .",
    "the difference in the behaviour of starless and star - forming clouds can be understood as a consequence of the physical conditions required to form co in low metallicity clouds .",
    "substantial amounts of co form only in gas with @xmath55 or above . in low metallicity clouds",
    ", this gas is found only in dense , gravitationally collapsing cores . at early times in the evolution of the cloud ,",
    "its structure is dominated by turbulence rather than gravity , and these dense cores are not present . consequently , the mean co brightness of the cloud at this time is extremely small . at later times",
    ", however , dense cores form due to gravitational instability , leading to a dramatic increase in the co brightness of the cloud . on the other hand , the [ ci ]",
    "abundance is far less sensitive to the visual extinction , and so the mean [ ci ]  brightness of the cloud varies much less as the cloud evolves .",
    "we have also examined how our results change if we relax our assumption that the dus - to - gas ratio @xmath33 scales linearly with the gas - phase metallicity , and instead allow it to drop more rapidly with decreasing @xmath41 , as suggested by the available observational data .",
    "we find that in practice , this strengthens our results regarding the relative usefulness of co and [ ci ]  as molecular gas tracers . significantly decreasing @xmath33 leads to a substantial decrease in the co content of the clouds at early times , and hence a substantial increase in @xmath3 . on other other hand",
    ", it has little influence on the value of @xmath3 that we recover once star formation begins . at the same time",
    ", reducing @xmath33 also leads to a decrease in the amount of h@xmath0 formed in the cloud , which acts to decrease @xmath3 , although this effect only seems to be important if the dust - to - gas ratio is very low .",
    "finally , we have examined the consequences of allowing the cosmic ray ionization rate to increase at the same time as the strength of the isrf , as we would expect to occur if both directly track the star formation rate ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we find that qualitatively , we recover similar results , but some of the quantitative details change .",
    "notably , increasing the cosmic ray ionization rate by a factor of 10 or 100 has only a minor effect on the values of @xmath3 we recover for our star - forming clouds ( contrary to the prediction of @xcite ) , but can lead to a factor of two to three decrease in @xmath1 , improving our prospects for using [ ci ]  emission to trace h@xmath0 in these systems .",
