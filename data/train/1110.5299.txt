    "free - space eit with standing - wave field geometries has been investigated both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite , and the influence of the atomic motion on the storage and retrieval of pulses in such geometries has been discussed in e.g.  @xcite .      to discuss the influence of the atoms longitudinal velocities on the cavity field spectrum in an eit situation in a relatively simple fashion , one can start from the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian1 ] ) without switching field and neglecting the variation of the control and probe field gouy phases and @xmath154-vector difference ( @xmath155 ) @xmath156 introducing @xmath157 and @xmath158 the optical dipole operators corresponding to the two running wave fields propagating with @xmath159 , one can recast ( [ eq : hamiltonian1bis ] ) into @xmath160 making the same assumptions as in sec .",

    "their dipole is reduced which means that the coupling strengths can be effectively rescaled by @xmath165 , yielding the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian2 ] ) .",
    "if we now assume that the atoms are sufficiently cold for their longitudinal positions to be fixed with respect to the longitudinal standing - wave structure of the cavity fields during the eit interaction , one keeps the longitudinal dependance in the coupling terms to solve the previous equations of motion , which are equivalent to @xmath166 solving eqs .",
