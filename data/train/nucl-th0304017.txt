    "heavy meson production in nucleon nucleon ( @xmath9 ) collisions can , in principle , provide important information about the short - range part of the @xmath9 interaction  @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath10 reactions at their threshold energies probe distances between the two colliding nucleons of about @xmath11 fm  @xcite .",
    "the distance corresponds to the  overlapping region \" of the two interacting nucleons , in contrast to the distance of about @xmath12 fm probed by much lighter pion production  @xcite .",
    "therefore , investigation of such heavy meson production reactions should ultimately provide relevant information for testing qcd - based @xmath9 interactions .",
    "recently , there has been considerable interest in the vector mesons @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in connection with the ozi rule  @xcite violation , and in the strangeness content of the nucleon wave function  @xcite .",
    "for example , the crystal barrel experiments at lear ( cern )  @xcite found a strong violation of the ozi rule in the @xmath13 production rate in antiproton - proton ( @xmath14 ) annihilation .",
    "furthermore , it was also found that the @xmath1 to @xmath0 production ratio in the @xmath15 reactions was enhanced by about an order of magnitude relative to the ozi prediction after correcting for the available phase space volume  @xcite .",
    "these findings may be interpreted as a considerable admixture of the @xmath16 configuration in the nucleon wave function .",
    "another item of interest in @xmath0 meson production processes is the so - called  missing resonances \" problem , where constituent quark models predict more states than have been observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "this has been attributed to the possibility that many such missing resonances couple either weakly or not at all to the @xmath17 channel , but may couple more strongly or exclusively to the @xmath18 channel .",
    "indeed , some theoretical studies of @xmath0 photoproduction were made  @xcite inspired by this possibility .",
    "although , so far , no baryon resonances have been observed to decay into the @xmath18 channel , some theoretical efforts have been made to estimate the coupling strengths of @xmath0 to the experimentally observed resonances  @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations for such a study is the possibility to account for the observed enhancement of the low - mass dilepton pair production in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the downward shift of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 meson masses ( but a smaller shift for the @xmath1 meson mass ) in the nuclear medium  @xcite is also considered as a possible source of the observed enhancement . indeed if the downward shift is large enough , @xmath0 meson is expected to form meson - nucleus bound states  @xcite . in any case",
    "a better understanding of the vector meson production mechanism in free space is a prerequisite to study such in - medium effects , and also to study the possible couplings of the @xmath0 meson to ( missing ) resonances .",
    "however , in spite of the pronounced interest in the vector mesons @xmath21 and @xmath1 , so far there exist only a limited number of theoretical studies of the near - threshold @xmath4  @xcite and @xmath7  @xcite reactions .",
    "this situation also holds for the near - threshold @xmath22  @xcite and @xmath23he@xmath24  @xcite reactions .    from the experimental side , apart from the old data at high excess energies  @xcite , only the total cross section data from saturne",
    "@xcite were available until recently for @xmath4 in the near - threshold region with excess energies below @xmath25 mev , where the excess energy @xmath26 is defined as , @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 being the total center - of - mass energy and masses of the particles in the final state , respectively .",
    "there are also total cross section and angular distribution data at excess energy @xmath30 mev from the disto collaboration  @xcite .",
    "recently the cosy - tof collaboration has measured the total cross section for @xmath4 at two excess energies , @xmath31 and @xmath32 mev  @xcite .",
    "these fill in partly the energy gap between the saturne and disto data , and are critical in studying the energy dependence of the total cross section in the extended near - threshold region .",
    "in addition to the total cross sections , the cosy - tof collaboration has also measured the angular distribution of the @xmath0 meson produced at @xmath33 mev . as has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the angular distribution plays a major role in disentangling different reaction mechanisms .",
    "these new data from the cosy - tof collaboration , together with earlier data  @xcite , offer the opportunity to investigate the @xmath4 reaction more in detail than has been done previously .",
    "thus , in the present study we focus on the near - threshold @xmath4 reaction in free space .",
    "we study this reaction by considering two different possibilities : with and without the inclusion of nucleon resonances  @xcite . the possibility of a large , off - shell @xmath34 resonance contribution has been considered recently by the tbingen group  @xcite .    in the present work we also consider the @xmath7 reaction .",
    "the only data available for this reaction near - threshold energies are the reanalyzed total cross section and angular distribution from the disto collaboration at @xmath35 mev  @xcite .",
    "these data are not sufficient to provide stringent constraints on theoretical models . in studying the @xmath7 reaction we do not consider the possibility of nucleon resonances , because not enough data exist to either draw any meaningful conclusions about their role , or to fix new parameters associated with the resonances .",
    "( also note that no baryon resonances have been observed decaying into the @xmath36 channel . )    to study the @xmath3 reactions , we use a relativistic effective lagrangian at the hadronic level , where the reaction amplitude is calculated within the distorted wave born approximation , including both the initial and final state @xmath2 interactions ( denoted by isi and fsi , respectively ) .",
    "the isi is implemented in the on - shell approximation  @xcite , while the fsi is generated using the bonn @xmath9 potential model  @xcite .",
    "the finite width of the @xmath0 , which is very important near threshold energies , is also included .",
    "the @xmath37 fsi is included only via the pole diagrams ( s - channel processes ) .",
    "many of the cut - off parameters and coupling constants necessary for the present study have already been fixed from other reactions in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath4 reaction is apparently described better with the inclusion of nucleon resonances .",
    "however , in order to draw a definite conclusion we need more data for exclusive observables in the energy region above , but close to @xmath38 mev .",
    "this is because there is no established method to remove the multi - pion background associated with the @xmath0-meson width from the raw data in order to extract the cross sections .",
    "the finite @xmath0 width is very important for energies @xmath39 mev and can possibly make the extracted data strongly dependent on the model used in the analysis  @xcite . as for the @xmath7 reaction , we definitely need more data to constrain the model parameters .    this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the general structure of the reaction amplitude in the present approach is explained . in section iii",

    "different momentum dependences of the vector ( @xmath174 ) and the tensor ( @xmath175 ) strong form factors at the @xmath119 meson production vertex are quite possible . in particular , recent experimental results from the jefferson lab  @xcite for the ratio of the proton electric and magnetic form factors , @xmath176 ( @xmath177 : proton magnetic moment ) , show a linear decrease as the four - momentum transfer squared ( @xmath178 ) increases , namely , the vector ( @xmath174 ) to the tensor ( @xmath175 ) electromagnetic ratio is , @xmath179  @xcite , which shows that @xmath174 and @xmath175 have different momentum dependences .",

    "we have also considered a possible contribution of the @xmath187 mesonic current by assigning a reasonable range of values for the coupling constants and cut - off parameters associated with this current .",
    "but this also gives only a small contribution .",
    "thus , within the approach of considering only the contributions from the nucleonic and mesonic currents , it seems unlikely to be able to reproduce the measured energy dependence of the total cross section in the range of excess energies @xmath188 mev .",

    "in particular , as shown by penner and mosel  @xcite , effects of higher - order terms than the born term in the t - matrix equation is important and , consequently , they should be taken into account in a better way than through a form factor as has been done in the present work .",
    "the @xmath7 reaction can be treated in an analogous way to the @xmath4 reaction in section iii , namely , considering only the nucleonic ( @xmath99 ) and mesonic ( @xmath98 ) current contributions .",
    "however , the scarcity of data , especially in the near - threshold region , makes this study more difficult .",

    "@xcite was made within a similar approach to that of the present study , in the sense that it used a relativistic meson - exchange model , considering contributions from the nucleonic and @xmath293 exchange currents as the dominant contributions .",
    "the present study differs from that of ref  @xcite in that : ( 1 ) the @xmath1 angular distribution data from disto  @xcite used in this study were reanalyzed  @xcite and absolute normalization of the corresponding total cross section was established , and ( 2 ) the @xmath2 isi is included explicitly .",
    "the relative importance among the possible meson exchange current contributions was estimated based on an su(3 ) effective lagrangian , together with various effects described in ref .",
    "furthermore , the test calculations performed in ref .  @xcite showed that the @xmath293-exchange current was by far the dominant mesonic current .",
    "the _ combined _ contribution of all other meson - exchange currents to the total cross section is about two orders of magnitude smaller than this . moreover ,",
    "possible contributions from meson - exchange currents involving heavy mesons , in particular , the @xmath294- and @xmath295-exchange currents were also examined using the larger values of the coupling constants calculated from the observed decay of @xmath296 .",
    "however , this contribution , as well as the @xmath297- and @xmath298-exchange currents , also turned out to be negligible  @xcite . finally , as in the case of @xmath0 production , there are neither experimental indications of any of the known isospin-1/2 @xmath201 resonances decaying into the @xmath299 channel , nor do there exist enough data for the near - threshold @xmath7 reaction to fix the relevant parameters and judge their validities .",
    "thus , we study the @xmath7 reaction considering the contributions only from the nucleonic and @xmath293 mesonic currents .    the coupling constant , @xmath300 , associated with the mesonic current @xmath137 , can be extracted from the measured branching ratio .",
    "specifically , the coupling constant @xmath301 is determined directly from the measured decay width of @xmath302  @xcite , where the sign is inferred from su(3 ) symmetry  @xcite .",
    "we note that the coupling constant @xmath301 is extracted at different kinematics compared to that of the @xmath0 : @xmath300 is determined at @xmath303 and @xmath304 , whereas @xmath145 is extracted at @xmath305 and @xmath304 .",
    "then , the corresponding form factor ( cf .",

    "although we do not have to use the same parameters for the @xmath1 production as those used in the @xmath4 reaction , we use the same value @xmath160 mev for the cut - off parameter in the @xmath8 meson production vertex , because the @xmath293 exchange current gives the dominant contribution to the total cross section , and reproducing the absolute normalization of the total cross section is relatively insensitive to the cut - off parameter @xmath136 in the nucleonic current compared to the cut - off parameters in the @xmath293 vertex form factors .",
    "therefore , we have three free parameters to be adjusted to reproduce the @xmath1 meson production total cross section and angular distribution data  @xcite , namely , @xmath308 and @xmath309 in the nucleonic current , after replacing @xmath310 in eq .",

    ", it may be interesting to compare the values of @xmath308 and @xmath309 obtained in the present work with those extracted in ref .",
    "@xcite by studying the off - shell time - like nucleon form factors using the @xmath322 reaction .",
    "they obtained @xmath323 .",
    "( note that their definition of @xmath309 is different from that of the present study by a factor @xmath324 ( @xmath325 : masses of the nucleon and @xmath1 meson ) ; for comparison , this factor is included in the value of @xmath309 here . )",
    "next , using the four parameter sets given in table  [ tab_phi ] , we study the energy dependence of the @xmath7 total cross section . we show the calculated results in fig .",
    "[ fig_phixsec ] .",
    "the results exhibit very similar energy dependences for the parameter sets @xmath326 and @xmath327 , while that for @xmath328 shows a different dependence especially at excess energies in the region @xmath329 mev .",
    "thus , measuring the energy dependence of the total cross section for @xmath329 mev will help constrain better the model parameters , in particular , the magnitude of the coupling constant @xmath308 .",
    "we have studied the @xmath3 reactions using a relativistic effective lagrangian at the hadronic level , including both the initial and final state @xmath2 interactions . for both reactions",
    "we have made use of the recently measured @xmath0 and @xmath1 angular distributions in addition to the total cross section data to fix the model parameters .",
    "we have studied the @xmath4 reaction considering two possibilities , i.e. , the @xmath0 meson is produced by : ( 1 ) the nucleonic and mesonic current contributions , and ( 2 ) the nucleonic , mesonic and nucleon resonance current contributions .",
    "the results show that the energy dependence of the total cross section in the range of excess energies @xmath330 mev , is apparently described better by the inclusion of nucleon resonances , which is implemented in a way to be consistent with the @xmath5 reaction .",
    "however , the calculation still underestimates the saturne data by about a factor of two , where the data points are in the range of excess energies @xmath6 mev .",
    "this remains still a problem in understanding the reaction mechanism . in this connection , we need more data for exclusive observables in the energy region above , but close to @xmath38 mev because there is no established method for removing the multi - pion background associated with the @xmath0-meson width from the raw data .",
    "this removal is necessary for extracting the cross sections in the energy region , @xmath39 mev , where the effect of the width is very important , and the extraction can be highly model dependent .    in connection with studying resonance contributions to the @xmath4 reaction , we plan to investigate the @xmath331 invariant mass distributions for this reaction  @xcite",
    ". a measurement of the invariant mass distributions for this reaction , should give significant information as to whether contributions from resonances are appreciable or not .",
    "such theoretical studies have been made for the @xmath83  @xcite , and @xmath332  @xcite reactions .",
    "thus , the study of the invariant mass distributions may be an alternative method for studying the possible @xmath0-meson ( and @xmath1-meson ) resonance couplings both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "in addition to the @xmath4 reaction , we have studied the @xmath7 reaction considering the contributions solely from the nucleonic and mesonic current contributions . because of the scarcity of data for this reaction in the near threshold energy region",
    ", we have obtained four parameter sets which can reproduce the @xmath1 angular distribution data from disto  @xcite equally well .",
    "predictions for the energy dependence of the @xmath7 total cross section indicate that a measurement of the cross section close to threshold should be able to constrain better the coupling constant @xmath308 ( @xmath333 or @xmath334 ) .",
    "finally , although there exists an enormous interest in vector meson properties in highly complicated many - nucleon environments , e.g. , dilepton production in heavy ion collisions and meson ( @xmath0 ) nuclear bound states , the data for the @xmath335 reaction ( @xmath102 : vector meson ) are currently inadequate for understanding the production mechanism of these mesons in free space .",
    "thus , more measurements of vector meson production in free space , and especially in @xmath9 collisions , may be a first step towards understanding the properties of vector mesons in such complicated nuclear environments .",
