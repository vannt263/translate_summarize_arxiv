    "the characterization and quantification of quantum correlations in composite quantum systems is of primary importance in quantum information theory . in particular , it is a prerequisite for understanding the origin of the quantum advantages in tasks of quantum technology and quantum information processing .",
    "it has been recognized in the last decade that quantum correlations may be present even in separable mixed states .",
    "the quantum - correlated states are singled out by a non - vanishing value of the entropic quantum discord ( whose definition and properties will be recalled in the following )  @xcite .",
    "states of a bipartite system @xmath0 with vanishing quantum discord with respect to subsystem @xmath1 possess only classical correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath2 and are called classical - quantum ( or @xmath1-classical ) states .",
    "they are of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space @xmath5 of the reference subsystem @xmath1 , @xmath6 is the dimensionality of @xmath5 , the set @xmath7 is a probability distribution ( i.e. , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , and @xmath10 are arbitrary states of subsystem @xmath2 .",
    "the classical - quantum states ( [ eq : cq ] ) form a non convex set @xmath11 , the convex hull of which is the set of all separable states .",
    "this means that there are separable states which are not classical - quantum . for pure states ,",
    "however , classicality is equivalent to separability , since a pure state is classical - quantum if and only if it is a product state .",
    "therefore quantum correlations must coincide with entanglement on pure states .",
    "the evaluation of the entropic quantum discord is a highly nontrivial challenge , even when one restricts to the simplest case of two qubits ( see e.g. refs .",
    "geometric measures of quantum discord provide alternative ways to the entropic discord for quantifying quantum correlations in bipartite systems  @xcite .",
    "these measures offer the advantage of easier computability .",
    "most of them have operational interpretations in terms of state distinguishability .",
    "on the other hand , they depend on a specific choice of some distance @xmath12 on the set of quantum states of the bipartite system @xmath0 .",
    "the most common choices are : 1 ) the _ trace distance _ @xmath13 and _ hilbert - schmidt distance _ @xmath14 , defined respectively as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two arbitrary states of @xmath0 and @xmath18 is the modulus of the operator @xmath19 ; 2 ) the _ bures distance",
    "_  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the uhlmann fidelity between @xmath16 and @xmath22 ; 3 ) the _ quantum hellinger distance _ , called `` hellinger distance '' for brevity in the sequel , which is defined as @xmath23 for each of these distances , three major classes of geometric measures have been introduced in recent years :    * the requirement that quantum correlations must vanish on the classical - quantum states has been exploited in refs .",

    "this inequality is an equality if @xmath12 is the hilbert - schmidt distance  @xcite . for the trace distance , the geometric discord and measurement - induced geometric discord coincide only if @xmath1 is a qubit ( see ref .",

    "[ sec - meas_ind_geo_disc ] below ) .",
    "* imposing the fundamental requirement that quantum correlations should be invariant under local changes of basis , one can introduce the _ discord of response _ , defined as  @xcite @xmath31 where the minimum is taken over all local unitary operators @xmath32 on @xmath5 separated from the identity by the condition of having a fixed non - degenerated spectrum @xmath33 given by the roots of unity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a thorough discussion on the choice of the spectrum ) .",
    "hereafter we denote by @xmath34 the family of such unitaries with spectrum @xmath35 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath36 in eq .",

    ", the normalization is such that @xmath39 has maximal value equal to unity .",
    "the discord of response characterizes how distinguishable is the locally unitarily perturbed state from the original one .",
    "alternatively , it can be seen as a measure of the sensitivity of the state @xmath16 to local unitary perturbations .",
    "for the hilbert - schmidt distance it holds @xmath40 when @xmath1 is a qubit  @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we omit for simplicity the lower subscript @xmath1 on the discord @xmath41 , as we will always take @xmath1 as the reference subsystem .",
    "the chosen distance is indicated explicitly .",
    "for instance , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 denote the geometric discords defined via the trace , hilbert - schmidt , bures , and hellinger distances , respectively .",
    "let us note that another class of geometric measures , called the surprisal of measurement recoverability , has been studied recently in ref .",
    "it is given in terms of the minimal distance between @xmath16 and the subset formed by all transformations of @xmath16 under entanglement breaking channels acting on @xmath1 .    besides the fact that the discords defined in eqs .",
    "( [ def : geomdisc1])-([def : quantumn ] ) are typically easier to compute than the entropic quantum discord of refs .",
    "@xcite , one of the main appealing features of the geometric approach is that it contains additional information . more specifically ,",
    "let us consider a state @xmath16 in the set @xmath46 of all quantum states of @xmath0 and a distinguished subset of @xmath46 , which might coincide with i )  the subset @xmath11 of classical - quantum states , or ii )  the subset formed by all post - measurement states obtained from @xmath16 through local von neumann measurements on @xmath1 , or iii )  the subset formed by all local unitary transformations of @xmath16 with unitaries in @xmath34 .",
    "then the state belonging to this subset that is closest to @xmath16 for the distance @xmath12 provides some useful geometrical information about @xmath16 , which goes beyond the sole knowledge of the value of the distance between @xmath16 and this closest state .",
    "for instance , it has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to measure classical correlations in @xmath16 by determining the minimal distance between a product state and a closest classical - quantum state to @xmath16 .",
    "the geometrical information can also be useful when considering dissipative dynamical evolutions .",
    "for instance , one can get some insight on the efficiency of the dynamical process in changing the amount of quantum correlations by comparing the physical trajectory @xmath47 in @xmath46 with the geodesics connecting @xmath48 to its closest classical - quantum state(s ) .",
    "another important feature of the geometric measures , which is related to the distinguishability of quantum states , concerns their operational interpretations . indeed",
    ", various instances of these measures turn out to be valuable figures of merit in the context of quantum technology protocols  @xcite , including quantum illumination  @xcite , quantum metrology and phase estimation  @xcite , quantum refrigeration  @xcite , and quantum local uncertainty  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the discord of response enjoys a beautiful operational interpretation in terms of the probability of error in protocols of quantum reading and quantum illumination  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop a systematic theory and exact mathematical characterization , quantification , and comparison between the geometric measures according to the different definitions in eqs .",
    "( [ def : geomdisc1])-([def : quantumn ] ) and to the different distances introduced above .",
    "we establish algebraic relations and inequalities holding between them .",
    "in particular , we provide a lower bound on the geometric discord @xmath49 for the bures distance in terms of the corresponding discord for the hellinger distance , and show that the latter is simply related to the hilbert - schmidt geometric discord for the square root of the state . thanks to this relation ,",
    "the hellinger geometric discord @xmath50 is fully computable ; we illustrate this point by giving a closed expression for arbitrary qubit - qudit states . for a fixed distance , we also bound @xmath51 and @xmath52 in terms of @xmath53 and @xmath51 in terms of @xmath52 .",
    "bounds between @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are obtained as well .",
    "we show that some of these bounds are tight . in the particular case where the reference subsystem @xmath1 is a qubit ( the other subsystem being arbitrary )",
    ", we show that @xmath57 and derive an exact algebraic relation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 holding for both the bures and the hellinger distances .",
    "remarkably , this relation has the same form for the two metrics .",

    ", we establish that the hellinger geometric discord @xmath50 and the hellinger discord of response @xmath58 provide the first two instances of measures of quantum correlations that are fully computable , reliable  since they satisfy all the basic axioms that must be obeyed by a _ bona fide _ measure of quantum discord ( which are detailed below )  , and operationally viable in terms of distinguishability of quantum states .    a further way to compare the measures defined in eqs .",
    "( [ def : geomdisc1])-([def : quantumn ] ) is to study the maximally quantum - correlated states at fixed global state purity for the different measures .",
    "we obtain analytical expressions for the maximal discord of response of two - qubit states as a function of their purity for the trace and hellinger distances and compare our results with those found previously in the literature for the hilbert - schmidt and bures metrics .",
    "finally , we discuss applications of the geometric measures to the problem of quantumness breaking channels .",
    "we determine a necessary condition for a local channel to destroy completely the quantum correlations of any bipartite state .    before going into the detailed presentation and discussion of our results , it is worth recalling what we exactly mean by a _ bona fide _ measure of quantum correlations .",
    "following previous works  @xcite , we stipulate that such a measure must be a non - negative function @xmath41 on the set of quantum states of the bipartite system @xmath0 fulfilling the following four basic axioms :    * @xmath41 vanishes on classical - quantum states and only on such states ; * @xmath41 is invariant under local unitary transformations @xmath59 ( here @xmath32 and @xmath60 are unitaries acting on subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively ) ; * @xmath41 is monotonically non - increasing under local completely positive trace preserving ( cptp ) maps acting on subsystem @xmath2 ; * @xmath41 reduces to an entanglement monotone on pure states .",
    "axioms ( i - iv ) are satisfied in particular by the entropic quantum discord . here , we point out that proper measures of quantum correlations should also obey the following additional requirement ( which is also fulfilled by the entropic discord )  @xcite :    * if the dimension @xmath6 of @xmath5 is smaller or equal to the dimension @xmath61 of the space @xmath62 of @xmath2 , then @xmath63 is maximum if and only if @xmath16 is maximally entangled , that is , @xmath16 has maximal entanglement of formation @xmath64 .",
    "let us note that axioms ( iii ) and ( iv ) imply that , when @xmath65 , @xmath41 is maximum on maximally entangled pure states , i.e. , if @xmath16 is a maximally entangled pure state then @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "this follows from the facts that a function @xmath41 on @xmath46 satisfying ( iii ) is maximal on pure states if @xmath65  @xcite and that any pure state can be obtained from a maximally entangled pure state via a locc  @xcite .",
    "thus , if axioms ( i - iv ) are satisfied , the additional requirement in axiom ( v ) is essentially that @xmath66 holds _ only _ for the maximally entangled states @xmath16 .    it has been shown in previous works  @xcite that the geometric discord @xmath49 and discord of response @xmath67 satisfy axioms ( i)-(iv ) for the bures distance , and hence are _ bona fide _ measures of quantum correlations . in this paper",
    ", we will prove that this is also the case for the three measures @xmath50 , @xmath68 , and @xmath56 based on the hellinger distance , as well as for the bures measurement - induced geometric discord @xmath69 and trace discord of response @xmath54 .",
    "in contrast , it is known that @xmath70 and @xmath71 do not fulfill axiom ( iii ) because of the lack of monotonicity of the hilbert - schmidt distance under cptp maps ( an explicit counter - example is given in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath72 and applies to @xmath71 as well , see below ) .",
    "therefore , the use of the hilbert - schmidt distance in the definitions of eqs .",
    "( [ def : geomdisc1])-([def : quantumn ] ) can and does lead to unphysical predictions . considering the distances @xmath73 associated to the @xmath74-norms @xmath75 , one has that for @xmath76 , @xmath73 is not contractive under cptp maps  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a counter - example for @xmath77 , which also holds for any @xmath76 ) .",
    "this is why the distances @xmath73 can not be used to define measures of quantumness apart from the case @xmath78 , corresponding to the contractive trace distance , while for @xmath77 the non - contractive hilbert - schmidt distance is well tractable and thus used to establish bounds on the _ bona fide _ geometric measures .",
    "regarding our last axiom ( v ) , the only result established so far in the literature concerns the bures geometric discord  @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate below that all the other measures based on the trace , bures , and hellinger distances also satisfy this axiom .",
    "our proofs are valid for arbitrary ( finite ) space dimensions @xmath6 and @xmath61 of subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 , excepted for @xmath50 , for which they are restricted to the special cases @xmath79 , and for @xmath80 , @xmath42 , and @xmath81 , for which they are restricted to @xmath82 .    the paper is organized as follows .",
