    "it is well known that the multi - antenna transmission scheme is imperative for reliable , high data rate , wireless communication which unfortunately comes at the cost of substantial decoding complexity at the receiver .",
    "the inherent cause for high decoding complexity at the receiver is the inter - antenna element ( iae ) interference which arises due to the simultaneous activation of all the antennas at the transmitter .",
    "for example , in the vertical bell laboratories layered space - time ( v - blast ) architecture @xcite , the maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding complexity is exponential in the number of transmit antennas .",
    "though , the sphere decoding ( sd ) @xcite algorithm with sufficiently large search - radius guarantees ml performance @xcite , @xcite the reduction in the search complexity due to sd at low signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) is very low compared to that at the high snrs .",
    "furthermore , the v - blast scheme offers the maximum multiplexing gain while the diversity gain offered by it is only one . in order to achieve full transmit diversity , space - time block codes ( stbc ) @xcite were developed while aiming at reducing the decoding complexity as much as possible .",
    "some examples of these codes whose decoding complexities are same as that of a single - input multiple - output ( simo ) system are alamouti code @xcite , stbcs from orthogonal designs @xcite , and codes from complex interleaved orthogonal design ( ciod ) @xcite . though these codes offer low complexity ml decoding , their achievable multiplexing gains are limited . in @xcite , full diversity ,",
    "maximum multiplexing gain codes for arbitrary number of transmit antennas were proposed which also have been shown to have non vanishing determinant ( nvd ) property under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "current research in the area of stbcs is focused on obtaining codes having full diversity , high multiplexing gain , nvd property , and low ml decoding complexity .",
    "reference @xcite gives a comparison of the decoding complexities of various best known stbcs for @xmath1 and @xmath2 multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems .",
    "some recent results in this area for some asymmetric mimo configurations such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc , can be found in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "spatial modulation ( sm ) @xcite , @xcite and space shift keying ( ssk ) @xcite are some of the novel developments in the family of low complexity mimo schemes that reduce the ml decoding complexity at the receiver by completely removing the iae interference .",
    "specifically , in these schemes only one transmit antenna is activated in any symbol duration which results in the complete removal of iae interference , but this results in the transmit diversity order of only one and also limits the achievable rates . in @xcite , it was shown that a transmit diversity order of more than one can be achieved in sm systems by employing time - orthogonal pulse shaping ( tops ) filters . in @xcite , as an improvement over @xcite , the conventional sm scheme is extended by activating two transmit antennas for the transmission of the alamouti code @xcite and by employing tops waveforms over partitioned antenna pairs to achieve a transmit diversity order of two . recently , the authors in @xcite have compared the bandwidth requirement of the conventional sm scheme assumed to be employing raised - cosine filter / half - sine filter with that of the tops assisted ssk scheme employing hermite polynomial based tops filter @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that under stringent conditions on the energy containment , the bandwidth required by the tops assisted sm scheme is lesser than that of the conventional sm scheme .    against this background following are the novel contributions of this paper :    @xmath4 inspired by the application of tops filter in sm / ssk scheme , we propose tops for stbcs .",
    "we show that by properly applying the tops waveforms across space and time the iae interference can be partially removed thereby reducing the ml decoding complexity of the stbcs . specifically , given a design of an stbc we define an equivalence relation on its set of weight matrices and partition the set into disjoint subsets which do not overlap in space and time .",
    "if the number of such disjoint subsets is @xmath0 , then @xmath0 distinct tops waveforms are assigned to @xmath0 subsets .",
    "the transmitted symbols belonging to different subsets become separable over space and time since they do not overlap in space and time and also their associated shaping waveforms are time - orthogonal . thus",
    ", an stbc having @xmath0 disjoint subsets which don not overlap in space and time becomes @xmath0-group decodable .",
    "@xmath4 we study the reduction in the ml decoding complexity by the proposed application of the tops waveforms in some of the best known stbcs in the literature .",
    "we show that the order of the ml decoding complexity in these stbcs can be greatly reduced due to the application of the tops filters .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the system model considering distinct pulse shaping filters across transmit antennas and channel uses .",
    "section iii describes the proposed application of tops filters in stbcs and gives a systematic method for reducing the ml decoding complexity in stbcs . in section iv , we study the reduction in the decoding complexities considering some of the best known codes in the literature .",

    "let @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath59 , @xmath64 , which yields @xmath65 , and let the corresponding index set be @xmath66 .",

    "note that with the increase in @xmath0 for a fixed @xmath33 the bandwidth requirement of the tops filters increases @xcite .",
