    ", there is a spontaneous spatial modulation of an order parameter , which can be either the concentration or the magnetization of the particles , or a combination thereof .",
    "the period of the modulation is determined by the competition between long - range dipolar forces and short - range forces favoring constant density .",
    "it depends on the magnetic field and the thickness of the sample layer as discussed in a recent study on the aggregate size and spacing formed in a thin film of ferrofluid @xcite .",
    "this paper concerns the thermodynamic stability and pattern formation in a suspension of ferromagnetic particles in a carrier fluid in the presence of a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the sample layer .",
    "we formulate models for thin films of these suspensions in which particle concentration and magnetization , determined by the degree of alignment of magnetic moments as well as particle concentration , are treated as independent variables .",
    "we discuss two possible models for the entropy of the fluid , the lattice gas model and the carnahan - starling model @xcite .",
    "although the carnahan - starling model has already been used for magnetic fluids @xcite , it has not been used to describe transitions from a disordered to an ordered phase in ferrofluids .",

    "several previous studies , including those of andelman _ et al._@xcite and cebers@xcite , are based on landau expansion of a lattice - gas model in the vicinity of the liquid - gas critical point present in the absence of the long - range part of the dipolar interactions .",
    "the free energies of these models are even - order expansion up to fourth order in the deviation of the local density ( which includes the modulated and spatially uniform components ) from the liquid - gas critical density .",
    "our model free energy is in principle valid for arbitrary values of the spatially uniform part of the particle density .",
    "we place no restrictions on the spatially uniform components of the density , but we do expand the free energy in a power series in the spatially varying component of the density .",

    "the total free energy @xmath16 of the ferrofluid in a magnetic field breaks up into four main contributions : the free energy of independent magnetized particles in a magnetic field @xmath17 , the dipolar interaction energy @xmath18 , the entropic contribution of the hard spheres fluid , and the energy cost associated with deviations of @xmath2 from spatial uniformity @xmath19 . in this last term",
