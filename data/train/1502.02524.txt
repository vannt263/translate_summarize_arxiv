    "it is generally believed that there is a supermassive black hole ( bh ) at the center of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ; the gravitational potential of the bh is the ultimate energy source of the agn .",
    "the accreted matter of a bh forms an accretion disk and loses angular momentum through viscous or turbulent processes ( rees 1984 ) .",
    "broad emission lines are one of the dominant features of many agn spectra , which are produced in a ` broad line region ' ( blr ) nearby the bh . the blr is widely acknowledged to be photoionized by the continuum from the accretion disk ( e.g. , kwan & krolik 1981 ; ferland et al .",
    "1992 ) . in order to explain the special radiation properties of bl lac objects ( bl lacs ) , blandford & rees ( 1978 ) proposed that there are relativistic jet structures in these sources .",
    "the jet launching is reported to be connected with the central bh , accretion disk , and corona in a source ( armitage & natarajan 1999 ; merloni & fabian 2002 ; wang et al .",
    "2004 ; cao 2004 , 2014 ; yuan & narayan 2014 ; wilkins & gallo 2015 ; chen et al .",
    "the jets may be powered via the blandford@xmath5payne ( bp ; blandford & payne 1982 ) process by releasing the gravitational energy of accreting matter that moves toward the bh , and/or via blandford@xmath5znajek ( bz ; blandford & znajek 1977 ) mechanism by extracting the rotational energy of bh .",
    "so far , most confirmed extragalactic gev - tev emitters are blazars , a sub - sample of radio - loud agns with relativistic jets .",
    "blazars are divided into bl lacs and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) according to their emission line features .",
    "generally , the broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of bl lacs can be well explained with the synchrotron radiation and the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) scattering of the relativistic electrons in jets ( maraschi et al .",
    "1992 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "1996 , 2010 ; zhang et al . 2012 ; liao et al . 2014 ; yan et al .",
    "2014 ) ; however , fsrqs need a black body spectrum component and a component from inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the external photons to fit their broadband seds ( e.g. , sikora et al .",
    "1994 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "1996 , 2010 ; zhang et al . 2014 ; cao & wang 2013 ; chen et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ) . compared with bl lacs , fsrqs have prominent emission lines in their spectra , and sometimes there are significant blue bumps at @xmath7 hz in their observed broadband seds , which is believed to be the thermal emission of accretion disk . however , often no significant blue bump is observed in the seds since the nonthermal radiation from jet overwhelms the thermal mission from accretion disk , especially when the sources are in the high state ( e.g. , for 3c 454.3 , jorstad et al .",
    "hence , the gev fsrqs in which the broadband seds are dominated by the jet emission and the significant blue bumps of the thermal emission from accretion disk are observed in their seds , are the good candidates for investigating the correlations among their jet power , accretion disk radiation , and blr luminosity .",
    "the flux ratios of emission lines from blr are suggested to be approximately constant among different agns ( francis et al .",
    "1991 ; vanden berk et al . 2001 ) .",
    "if setting the emission line luminosity of ly@xmath8 to 100 , the relative luminosities of h@xmath9 , h@xmath8 , mg  ii , and c  iv lines are 22 , 77 , 34 , and 63 , respectively , and then the total emission line luminosity is 555.8 ( francis et al .",

    "1991 ; wandel et al . 1999",
    "; wu et al . 2004 ; greene & ho 2005 ) .",
    "another approach to estimate the mass of bh is to use the correlation between bh mass and stellar velocity dispersion by direct or indirect measurement of stellar velocity dispersion ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; wu & han 2001 ) , which is always used to estimate the bh masses in bl lacs ( woo & urry 2002 ; wu et al .",
    "the bh masses can also be derived using the relation between the bh mass and host - galaxy bulge luminosity ( e.g. , laor 2001 ) .",
    "there are 13 gev - fsrqs in our sample for which the bh masses are obtained from literature , as listed in table 2 ; the bh masses of 11 sources are estimated with the traditional virial method .",
    "for the other two soueces , one is derived with the relation of bh mass and bulge luminosity and the other one is estimated with the variability timescale .",
    "as mentioned in section 2 , there are significant blue bump components at @xmath7 hz in the observed seds of gev - fsrqs in our sample , which are due to the thermal emission of accretion disk .",
    "therefore , our model includes both the jet emission and accretion disk emission and the details of the model are described as follows .      the standard accretion disk spectrum in davis & laor ( 2011 ) is used to explain the significant bumps at ultraviolet band in the observed seds .",
    "the parameters include the inside and outside radius ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) of the accretion disk , bh mass , eddington ratio , and inclination to the line of sight @xmath28 .",
    "the bh mass is fixed and the fixed values of bh masses for the sources are listed in table 2 . ] .",
    "we take @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the schwarzschild radius ) and @xmath31 , and then vary both @xmath26 ( from 0.5@xmath30 to 4.5@xmath30 ) and the eddington ratio to model the accretion disk emission at ultraviolet band .      the issue that the radiation regions are inside or outside the blrs is very important to understand the properties of radiation regions , but highly debated .",
    "considering the limits of klein - nashina ( kn ) effect to explain the observation data at tev band and the absorption of @xmath32-rays via photon - photon pair production above 10 gev ( liu & bai 2006 ) of blr photon field , some authors suggested that the emission regions should be outside the blr and the photons from the torus dominate the ic process ( sikora et al .",
    "2009 ; tavecchio & mazin 2009 ; tavecchio et al .",
    "2013 ) . however , poutanen & stern ( 2010 ) reported that the spectral breaks in the 2@xmath510 gev range can be well reproduced by the absorption of @xmath32-rays via photon - photon pair production on he  ii lyman recombination continuum and lines , implying that the radiation regions of blazars are inside the highest ionization region of blr .",
    "isler et al . (",
    "2013 ) also reported that the correlation of the increased emission line flux with millimeter core ejections and @xmath32-ray , optical , and ultraviolet flares implies that the blr extends beyond the @xmath32-emitting region during the 2009 and 2010 flares for 3c 454.3 .",
    "sometimes the different timescales of variability are used to investigate the place of radiation region ( e.g. , sikora et al . 2009 ) .",
    "some authors used two - zone model to explain the observed sed for the above controversies ( e.g. , tavecchio et al .",
    "all the observed highest photon energies in our sample are smaller than 10 gev , except for pks 0727 - 11 , which is @xmath3320 gev , and thus we still assume that the radiation regions are inside the blrs and the external photon field is dominated by blr , not torus .",
    "therefore , the single - zone synchrotron+ic model is used to explain the jet emission , where the ic process includes both the ssc process and the external compton scattering of the blr photons ( ec / blr ) .",
    "although the kn effect and the absorption of high energy gamma - ray photons by extragalactic background light ( franceschini et al .",
    "2008 ) are not significant in the model calculation , we still take them into account .",
    "the radiation region is assumed to be a sphere with radius @xmath34 , which is obtained with @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the beaming factor , @xmath37 is the variability timescale and taken with @xmath38 hr following our previous works ( zhang et al .",
    "2012 , 2014 ) .",
    "the electron distribution is taken as a broken power law , which is characterized by an electron density parameter ( @xmath39 , in units of @xmath40 ) , a break energy @xmath41 and indices ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) in the range of @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "the indices of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are derived from the spectral indices of the observed seds as reported by zhang et al .",
    "@xmath45 can be only poorly constrained by the last data point in the seds and is usually dozens of times of @xmath41 , but it does not significantly affect our results .",
    "the energy density of blr in the jet is boosted by a factor of @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is the bulk lorentz factor ) and a corrected factor of 17/12 for @xmath48 proposed by ghisellini & madau ( 1996 ) is also considered because the blr is not uniform and has an angle to the disk .",
    "so the derived energy density of the blr photon fields in the comoving frame is @xmath49 .",
    "the values of @xmath50 are listed in table 1 .",
    "for the sources whose @xmath48 are not available , the average of @xmath51 erg @xmath40 is taken .",
    "since for blazars we are likely looking at the jet within the @xmath52 cone , and that the probability is the highest at the rim of the cone , we take @xmath53 in all the calculations , i.e. , the viewing angle is equal to the opening angle of the jet .",
    "the free parameter set of our sed modeling is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 ( in units of g ) is the magnetic field strength of the radiation region . following our previous works ( zhang et al .",
    "2012 , 2014 ) , the @xmath56 minimization technique is also used to perform the sed fits .",
    "since no errors are available for some data points in the selected seds , we estimate their errors with the average relative errors of the data points whose errors are available in order to obtain the goodness of the sed fit with the @xmath56 minimization technique .",
    "the average relative errors of the data for the bumps are derived separately ( with a separation at @xmath57 hz ; e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "2012 , 2014 ) because the relative errors of the data for the synchrotron bump and ssc bump are usually much smaller than those for the ec bump . for 3c 454.3 , pks 1510@xmath5089 , and pks 2123@xmath5463 , no error of observation data below @xmath57 hz is available , and we take 10% of the observation flux as the errors ( zhang et al . 2012 ; 2014 ) .",

    "these results may indicate that the total accretion power of bh is sufficient to launch the jets in gev - fsrqs , at least for the jet radiation in low state when the accretion disk radiation is not overwhelmed by the jet radiation ; however the lack of strong correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 may imply that their energy sources are not exactly the same for gev - fsrqs .",
    "but the strong correlations between @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath6 for fsrqs , gev nls1 galaxies , and bl lacs may imply that the eddington ratio may be the fundamental in the unified framework among different types of gev agns .",

    "this tentative correlation may be due to that the emission of gev fsrqs is dominated by ec process , for which the photon field is from blr .",
    "it is similar to the @xmath1@xmath97 plane , bl lacs , gev nls1 galaxies , and fsrqs also form a sequence in the @xmath2@xmath97 plane .",
    "then we make multiple linear regressions of the 13 gev - fsrqs for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 and for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath97 , respectively .",

    "these results further confirm that @xmath1 for the 13 gev - fsrqs is tight correlated with @xmath2 , but with neither @xmath0 nor @xmath97 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath1 has the same energy origin as @xmath2 , but not @xmath0 ; @xmath1 is all from accretion process , but @xmath0 may be dominated by extracting the rotational energy of bh .",
    "hence the dominant mechanism of jet launching in these gev - fsrqs may be bz process as discussed in our previous works ( zhang et al .",
    "2014 ; sun et al .",
    "as described in section 4 , the different covering factor @xmath3 of blr for the 13 gev - fsrqs with the selected rqqs and rlqs should be due to the different distributions of their @xmath1 . in order to further compare the states of accretion disk among the three samples , the normalized distributions of bh masses ( @xmath123 ) and eddington ratio ( @xmath6 )",

    "therefore , the main reason for the different @xmath3 and @xmath6 of the 13 gev - fsrqs with rlqs and rqqs is the different distributions of their @xmath1 .",
    "note that the gev - fsrqs in our sample belong to blazars , in which the relativistic jets ( also the normal of the accretion disk ) are thought to be close to the line of sight . with the same intrinsic luminosity , one may observe the higher flux of accretion disk for the gev - fsrqs than other sources if the radiation of the accretion disk is anisotropic ( liu & zhang 2011 ) .",
    "assuming that the emitting flux of accretion disk depends on the inclination angle , i.e. , @xmath124 , where @xmath28 is the angle between the line of sight and the normal of the accretion disk , the inferred intrinsic luminosity of accretion disk should be @xmath125 ( see details in the appendix ) , i.e. , @xmath126 for the gev - fsrqs .",
    "assuming that the inclination of accretion disk for rlqs and rqqs is the average value of @xmath127 , the derived isotropic luminosity of accretion disk is just the inferred intrinsic luminosity of accretion disk for rlqs and rqqs , i.e. , @xmath128 .",
    "one would observe the similar distributions of blr covering factor ( @xmath129 ) for the gev - fsrqs with rlqs and rqqs if considering the inclination effect and anisotropic radiation of accretion disk ; the blr covering factor of the gev - fsrqs would be close to 0.1 with a mean of 0.086 , similar to rlqs and rqqs in shen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "recently , richards & lister ( 2015 ) reported that the jets of radio - loud ( rl ) nls1 galaxies are aligned at moderately small angles to the line of sight , which is similar to blazars .",
    "hence the intrinsic luminosity of accretion disk for gev nls1 galaxies should have the same correction factor as fsrqs and bl lacs , i.e. , @xmath126 .",
    "taking the anisotropic radiation of accretion disk into account in the @xmath130@xmath0 and @xmath130@xmath97 planes , the results are given in figure [ pjet - pr - ldisk_theta ] .",
    "for most of the sources , @xmath0 is higher than @xmath130 , but most of the fsrqs and nls1 galaxies still have higher accretion power of bh ( @xmath131 ) than @xmath0 , indicating that the pure accretion power is still enough to drive their jet . in the @xmath130@xmath97 plane ,",
    "the sources still form a sequence and are also closer to the equality line , implying that the radiation power of jet is already comparable with the luminosity of accretion disk for the gev sources .",
    "following our previous works , the sed fits in this paper are still under the assumption of @xmath53 , i.e. , the viewing angle is equal to the opening angle ( @xmath52 ) of a jet , since the probability is the highest when looking at the jet at the angle of @xmath52 as described in section 3.2 .",
    "it is well known that there is doppler boosting effect in the radiation of balzars .",
    "if the viewing angle is larger than the opening angle of the jet , the leptonic models would not be able to explain the observation data . in another scenario , @xmath132",
    "when the viewing angle is smaller than the opening angle of the jet , where the coefficient of @xmath133 ranges from 1 to 2 , the calculated jet powers with the derived parameters would be lower than the previous results ( under the assumption of @xmath53 ) .",
    "that means the jet powers may be overestimated under the assumption of @xmath53 to fit the seds ; under this case , the jet powers are further lower than those that derived with the assumption of @xmath53 , strengthening the above conclusion that the jet powers are lower than the accretion power of bh .      the radiation of fsrqs and bl lacs as well as the confirmed gev nls1 galaxies ( abdo et al .",

    "the observed spectral properties of the gev nls1 galaxies are analogous to gev fsrqs with significant broad emission lines and the blue bump from accretion disk radiation .",
    "bl lacs are defined as the equivalent width ( ew ) of emission lines in the rest frame being less than 5 @xmath70 , and no significant blue bump at @xmath7 hz is observed in their seds . in recently years , some sources that are classified as bl lacs show some properties similar to fsrqs ( sbarufatti et al . 2005 ;",

    "it is found that the distributions of @xmath2 form a sequence along bl lac  nls1fsrq , and @xmath2 of bl lacs are intrinsically weak compared with that of rl nls1 galaxies and gev fsrqs .",
    "it may be due to the intrinsically weak radiation of the accretion disk in bl lacs , and thus it is easily overwhelmed by the jet emission .",
    "there is also a bl lac ",
    "nls1fsrq sequence in the @xmath6 distribution .",
    "it can be found that @xmath6 for most of the bl lacs are lower than 0.01 , but @xmath6 for the gev fsrqs is higher than 0.01 ( see also ghisellini et al .",
    "2010 ; a division to separate bl lacs and fsrqs ) .",
    "the @xmath6 distribution of nls1 galaxies is intermediate between fsrqs and bl lacs , and is more analogous to that of fsrqs .",
    "as shown in figure [ pjet - pr - ldisk ] , @xmath0 is strongly correlated with @xmath1 and @xmath6 if taking all the data of fsrqs , gev nls1 galaxies , and bl lacs into account , indicating the accretion rate is very important to drive jets .",
    "zhang ( 2013 ) and sun et al .",
    "( 2015 ) also proposed that the accretion rate ( see also shen & ho 2014 ) may be the fundamental in the unified framework among different types of gev agns ; along with the bl lac  nls1fsrq sequence , the increase of the eddington ratio corresponds to the change of the accretion disk structure , and then may correspond to the transformation of the dominant mechanism for jet launching .",
    "the jets of gev fsrqs may be powered via extracting the rotational energy of bh with bz process , which is also consistent with the uncorrelation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 of the gev fsrqs as described in section 5 .",
    "however , the jets of bl lacs and nls1 galaxies may be produced via the bp and/or bz mechanisms , depending on the structure and accretion rate of their accretion disks .",
    "note that the above discussion does not consider the correction of anisotropic radiation of accretion disk mentioned in section 7.1 , but this effect does not change the results since the jets of gev nls1 galaxies have the similar properties to that of blazars as discussed in section 7.1 .",
    "the topic of the differences and unification among the different types of agns has been extensively covered and discussed . according to the unified models for rl agns , bl lacs are associated with center - brightened ( fr i ) radio galaxies , whereas fsrqs are usually fond in edge - brightened ( fr ii ) radio galaxies ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "they may also correspond to the low - excitation radio galaxies ( lergs ) and high - excitation radio galaxies ( hergs ) , although the low / high - excitation radio galaxies do not have one - to - one correspondence with the fr i@xmath5fr ii categories ( hine & longair 1979 ; laing et al . 1994 ; hardcastle et al . 2009 ) .",
    "this is also consistent with numerous bl lacs with fr ii radio structure ( e.g. rector & stocke 2001 ) and some quasars with fr i characteristic ( e.g. , blundell & rawlings 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , intrinsically lergs and hergs may be the parent populations of bl lacs and fsrqs .",
    "recently , some authors suggested that the intrinsic differences between hergs and lergs are due to the different modes of accretion , i.e. , owing to the different accretion rates ( mingo et al .",
    "2014 ; fernandes et al .",
    "2015 ) ; hergs correspond to the radiatively efficient ` cold mode ' accretion with higher accretion rates , whereas lergs are the radiatively inefficient ` hot mode ' accretion with lower accretion rates .",
    "the switch lies approximately at the eddington rates 0.01@xmath330.04 , but the jet production is not switched off . however , the division between the two populations is not very clear , there is still some overlap with wider range of accretion rates for lergs ( mingo et al .",
    "these results agree well with ours .",
    "as described above , some of the radio properties between hergs with lergs do not show clear differences and there is no dependence between jet power with radiative luminosity for hergs , presumably implying that the process of power conversion into jet power is not solely controlled by the accretion rate ; an additional process must be influencing the jet formation , such as the spin of bh ( mingo et al .",
    "2014 ; fernandes et al . 2015 ) .",
    "this is also consistent with our results that there is no correlation between jet power with eddington ratio for single population of fsrqs , and the extraction of rotation energy of bh may be important to power their jets .",
    "the large scale kinetic powers of rgs usually are estimated with the radio luminosity at 151 mhz ( e.g. , godfrey & shabala 2013 ; mingo et al .",
    "2014 ) and they reflect the long - term average power injection from their jets over the whole rl lifetimes of the sources .",
    "averagely , the large kinetic powers of lergs are lower than that of hergs ( e.g. , mingo et al . 2014 ) .",
    "interestingly , the large scale kinetic powers of blazars is strongly correlated with their jet powers ( zhang et al . 2014 ) , which reflect essentially their instantaneous activities at the present epoch , and the large scale kinetic powers of bl lacs are lower than that of fsrqs ( zhang et al .",
    "2014 ; sun et al .",
    "the statistical associations of bl lacs with lergs and fsrqs with hergs suggest that the current core activities of lergs also have on average lower power outputs than hergs .",
    "there are two possible scenarios for the above main differences between the two classes of sources , i.e. , bl lacs / lergs and fsrqs / hergs .",
    "one scenario is that the two classes are essentially the same sources in nature , but their accretion disks may stay in different accretion states at different times and thus produce different jet / core power outputs . in other words , the two classes of objects would be converted from each other when the accretion states change .",
    "this scenario agrees with the fact that their host galaxies seem to show similar properties ( urry & padovani 1995 ; seymour et al . 2007 ; fernandes et al .",
    "2015 ) . however , a main consequence of this scenario is that their long - term average jet / core power outputs should be essentially the same , which contradicts with the observed higher large - scale jet kinetic powers of fsrqs / hergs than bl lacs / lergs .",
    "the alternative is that the two classes are essentially different objects with bl lacs / lergs tending to produce lower jet / core powers ( i.e. with lower accretion rate and/or black hole spin ) , resulting in the lower large - scale jet kinetic powers in bl lacs / lergs .",
    "the apparent contradiction in this scenario with the indistinguishable host galaxies of these two classes may be resolved if they have different circum - nuclear environments resulting in different accretion supply on the average .",
    "then the accretion disk instabilities and/or the different jet orientations may result in large scatter of the observed jet / core outputs at different times , in agreement with observations ( e.g. , mingo et al .",
    "future higher quality observations may test if their circum - nuclear environments are indeed different intrinsically .",
