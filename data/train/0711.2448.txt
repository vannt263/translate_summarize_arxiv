    "fitting colour temperatures to the x - ray spectra of accreting black holes ( bhs ) has traditionally been a useful , indirect method to estimate bh masses , typically within a factor of 2 .",
    "this method relies on the assumption that the accretion disk extends down to the innermost stable circular orbit and is optically - thick , emitting a multicolour - blackbody spectrum ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; frank , king & raine 2002 ) .",
    "if so , the fitted peak temperature and luminosity give a characteristic inner - disk area and hence bh mass .",
    "these conditions are usually verified in galactic bhs in their high - soft state ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "for ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , the scenario that the disk is optically thick and reaches the innermost stable circular orbit could be a plausible initial assumption , in the absence of dynamic mass determinations . from a characteristic feature in the soft spectrum ( `` soft excess '' ) , peak disk temperatures @xmath3@xmath4 kev have been inferred and used to suggest masses @xmath5 ( miller , fabian & miller 2004 ) .",
    "a strong objection against this argument is that most of the x - ray flux in ulxs comes out in a harder , power - law - like component , more consistent with inverse - compton scattering ( stobbart , roberts & wilms  2006 ; winter , mushotzky & reynolds  2006 ) .",
    "this suggests that the soft thermal component only traces emission from the outer , optically - thick disk , at radii @xmath6 ; if so , its temperature and luminosity can not be directly used to estimate the bh mass .",
    "an additional parameter is needed to model the location of the transition radius between the outer , standard disk and the inner , scattering - dominated region . in general ,",
    "based on a variety of physical arguments , we expect that the transition radius @xmath7 for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "a comparison of x - ray spectral and timing properties of ulxs and of galactic bhs , in particular xte j1550@xmath11564 , has suggested a possible physical interpretation in terms of a standard disk plus comptonizing corona ( goad et al .",
    "2006 ; done & kubota 2006 ) . unlike galactic bhs , however , many ulxs have a second characteristic spectral feature at energies @xmath12@xmath13 kev . there , the spectrum is not well approximated by a power - law : it shows a downward curvature or break ( stobbart et al .",
    "2006 ; roberts 2007 ) . in the disk - corona framework , this can be interpreted as emission from a corona optically - thick to electron scattering ( @xmath14 ) and with a much lower temperature than is seen in galactic bhs ( @xmath15 a few kev , compared with @xmath16 kev in galactic bhs ) . in summary",
    ", the high - energy break would be related to the coronal temperature , and the soft component would come from the standard disk sticking out outside the corona , at large radii .",
    "a possible difficulty of this model is that , in order to be optically thick , the corona must also be extremely dense .",
    "assuming a characteristic radial size of @xmath17 km , vertical size @xmath18 km , @xmath14 corresponds to @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "this is many orders of magnitude denser than typical coronae in galactic x - ray binaries .",
    "more importantly , one still has to explain how gravitational power is transferred from the underlying disk to the optically - thick corona . for proton densities",
    "@xmath21 @xmath20 , the thermal energy stored in such a corona is only @xmath22 erg , to be compared with a power @xmath23 erg s@xmath24 persistently transferred to the outgoing radiation via inverse compton scattering .",
    "if gravitational power is released in the disk , a very efficient and stable energy transfer mechanism is required to keep the corona energized .",
    "the same phenomenological spectral features have also been explained in a radically different way .",
    "the high - energy curvature and/or break have been interpreted as a very hot inner disk , with colour temperatures @xmath25@xmath26 kev : e.g. , stobbart et al .",
    "a possible reason for such hot disks may be that the bh is rapidly spinning . or",
    ", the disk may be non - standard , ( e.g. , slim disk models : watarai , mizuno & mineshige 2001 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "ulxs are a natural extension of galactic bhs , with higher accretion rates and hotter disks ( fig .  3 in stobbart et al .",
    "the downside of this model is that it does not provide a natural explanation for the soft x - ray component .",
    "one possibility is that the soft excess comes from a downscattering outflow ( king & pounds 2003 ) or from relativistically - blurred emission lines in the reflection spectrum of a photoionized disk ( crummy et al .",
    "in most ulxs , both scenarios ( cool disk with a hotter comptonised component , or a hot disk with a soft excess ) are consistent with the observed spectra .",
    "before we can use the peak disk temperature as a mass indicator , we need to determine whether the disk is associated with the soft or the hard components . here",
    ", we suggest that both interpretations are in a sense correct , and follow simply from the standard disk model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .    the thermal emission spectrum of an accretion disk is successfully approximated with a multicolor blackbody model , provided that two assumptions are verified : the disk is optically - thick in the vertical direction , and all the gravitational power dissipated during the infall is radiated .",

    "moving towards smaller radii , there is a region where the disk is still gas - pressure dominated and optically thick ( @xmath39 ) but the opacity is dominated by electron scattering ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "deep inside the disk , the radiation is still in thermal equilibrium with the matter ( @xmath43 ) , but the emerging spectrum from the disk surface is modified by scattering , such that the outgoing intensity @xmath44 ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) . from eq .",

    ", the disk may become optically thin to true absorption ( @xmath52 ) , but is always optically thick to scattering ( @xmath53 ) and most importantly , is still effectively optically thick ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "as long as @xmath39 , eqs .  7 and 9",
    "are still valid , and the emerging spectrum is still a modified blackbody .",

    "in fact , @xmath68 throughout the x - ray emitting regions , for the characteristic range of physical parameters typical of the high / soft state in galactic bhs . that is why @xmath69 can be approximated with a constant `` hardening factor '' @xmath70@xmath71 ( shimura & takahara 1995 ; shafee et al .",
    "2006 ; shrader & titarchuk 2003 ) .",
    "the previous results depend critically on the condition @xmath72 . from eq .",
    "17 , using the same set of parameters suitable for galactic bhs in a high state , we see that @xmath73 in the innermost region , at the eddington accretion rate ; at larger radii , @xmath39 .",
    "so , the optically - thick condition is always verified for galactic bhs , but the x - ray emitting region gets close to becoming effectively thin . a small increase in viscosity ,",
    "bh mass and/or accretion rate above eddington will lead to the formation of a radiation - pressure dominated , _ effectively - thin region in the inner disk _ ( @xmath74 , with @xmath52 and @xmath75 ) .",
    "if that happens , eq .  7 is no longer applicable .",
    "note that an increase of the accretion rate leads to a reduction of the effective optical depth in the radiation - dominated zone ( perhaps counter - intuitively ) .",
    "this is essentially because @xmath76 .",
    "conversely , in the gas - pressure dominated disk , an increase in @xmath77 leads to an increase in optical depth .    in the region where the disk becomes effectively thin ,",
    "the specific intensity emitted by an annulus is @xmath78 if all the flux is radiated from each annulus , the temperature must increase even more dramatically than in the optically - thick regime .",
    "the hardening factor is now @xmath79    let us consider a hypotetical ulx with a mass @xmath80 and an accretion rate @xmath81 .",
    "then , the inner disk is effectively thin for `` reasonable '' choices of @xmath82 , and the transition radius between thin and thick regions is @xmath83 for @xmath84 , the spectrum is a disk - blackbody , slightly modified by a hardening factor @xmath85 constant over the frequencies and radii relevant to the x - ray spectral observations , and most likely @xmath86 . for @xmath87 ,",
    "the hardening factor increases sharply towards the innermost stable circular orbit , reaching @xmath88 in the brightest region of the disk .",
    "although the effective optical depth is @xmath89 in this region , the optical depth to scattering alone @xmath90",
    "if a disk develops an effectively - thin inner zone , how would its spectrum differ from a multicolour blackbody ? to have a qualitative idea ,",
    "let us consider for simplicity a frequency - averaged hardening factor @xmath91 , such that @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93 .",

    "a detailed study of the emitted spectra is left to a paper currently in preparation .",
    "here we simply want to point out the main qualitative result : the spectrum has a power - law - like shape for energies @xmath97 kev , a downward curvature and break above 6 kev , and a `` soft excess '' with a characteristic temperature @xmath98 kev .",
    "the latter component corresponds to the disk - blackbody emission from the outer disk ( @xmath99 ) , where @xmath100 .",
    "the high - energy break corresponds to the maximum colour temperature in the effectively - thin , scattering - dominated inner disk : @xmath101 @xmath102 .",
    "this result is already well known ( shimura & takahara 1995 ; fig .  12 in shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , but its implications for ulx studies are not well explored . in between the two thermal features ,",
    "the slope of the power - law - like section of the spectrum depends on how steeply the hardening factor increases towards the centre .",
    "a slightly steeper slope is obtained when the frequency dependence in the hardening function @xmath103 is also taken into account .",
    "additional steepening of the spectrum results from non - radiative contributions ( outflows , poynting flux ) to the cooling flux from the inner region . increasing the range of values of the hardening factor ( for example , by increasing the viscosity or the accretion rate ) moves the soft excess and high - energy break below and above the observed x - ray band , respectively , creating an apparently `` pure power - law '' spectrum .",
    "we have shown that the accretion disk in bhs with @xmath104 , @xmath105 a few @xmath106 is expected to develop a scattering - dominated , effectively - thin inner region ( @xmath107 ) , with a corresponding increse in the colour temperature , to compensate for the decreased emission efficiency .",
    "the predicted spectrum is very similar to what is observed from many ulxs at @xmath108 erg s@xmath24 .",
    "phenomenologically , those spectra have been successfully fitted with an optically - thick disk - blackbody emission from the outer disk , plus a dense scattering corona in the inner region , `` covering '' the inner disk .",
    "we have shown here that the characteristic scattering opacity , size and temperature observationally inferred for those `` coronae '' are the same as predicted for a radiation - pressure dominated standard disk , for accretion rates and bh masses consistent with ulx parameters .",
    "so , we argue that there is no need to postulate an ad - hoc corona covering or replacing the inner disk .",
    "it is the standard disk itself that becomes a hot , scattering - dominated environment at small radii , and produces the observed spectra .",
    "the advantage of seeing it as the inner disk rather than a corona is that we do not have to worry about how energy is transferred from one to the other , or how their interface looks like .",
    "moreover , in the scattering disk scenario , the peak temperature , optical depth and emitted flux are not just empirical parameters : they are predictable functions of @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath82 , known from standard - disk models .",
    "this provides the tools to determine the physical properties of the accreting bhs in ulxs from their fitted spectral parameters , and relate their spectral evolution to changes in the accretion rate . in this scenario , both",
