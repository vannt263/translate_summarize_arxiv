    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the charged weak interaction is described by the exchange of a @xmath6 boson with a pure vector coupling to only left - chirality fermions .",
    "thus , in the low - energy four - fermion framework , the lorentz structure of the matrix element is predicted to be of the `` v - a@xmath7v - a '' type .",
    "deviations from this behavior would indicate new physics and might be caused either by changes in the w - boson couplings or through interactions mediated by new gauge bosons .",
    "leptonic decays such as @xmath8 ( unless specified otherwise , charge - conjugated decays are implied throughout the paper ) are the only ones in which the electroweak couplings can be probed without disturbance from the strong interaction .",
    "this makes them an ideal system to study the lorentz structure of the charged weak current .",
    "the most general , lorentz invariant , derivative - free and lepton - number - conserving four - lepton point interaction matrix element for this decay can be written as @xcite : @xmath9 \\biggl[\\bar{u}_m(\\nu_{\\tau})\\gamma_n u_j(\\tau^-)\\biggr],\\ ] ] @xmath10 the @xmath11 matrices define the properties of the two currents under a lorentz transformation with @xmath12 for scalar , vector and tensor interactions , respectively .",
    "the indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 label the right- or left - handedness ( r , l ) of the charged leptons . for a given @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ,",
    "the handedness of the neutrinos ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) is fixed .",
    "ten non - trivial terms are characterized by ten complex coupling constants @xmath18 ; those with @xmath19 and @xmath20 are identically zero . in the sm , the only non - zero coupling constant is @xmath21 .",
    "as the couplings can be complex , with arbitrary overall phase , there are 19 independent parameters .",
    "the total strength of the weak interaction ( charged weak current sector ) is determined by the fermi constant @xmath22 , hence , the @xmath18 are normalized as : @xmath23 @xmath24 this constrains the coupling constants to be @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    in the case",
    "where neutrinos are not detected and the spin of the outgoing charged lepton is not determined , only four michel parameters ( mp ) @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are experimentally accessible .",

    "measurement of @xmath28 and @xmath29 requires knowledge of the @xmath0 spin direction . in experiments at @xmath44 colliders with unpolarized @xmath45 beams ,",
    "the average polarization of a single @xmath0 is zero .",
    "however , spin - spin correlations between the @xmath46 and @xmath47 produced in the reaction @xmath48 can be exploited @xcite .",
    "the main idea of our method is to consider events where both taus decay to selected final states .",
    "one ( signal ) tau decays leptonically ( @xmath49 ,  @xmath50 ) while the opposite tau , which decays via @xmath51 , serves as a spin analyser .",
    "we choose the @xmath52 decay mode because it has the largest branching fraction as well as properly studied dynamics @xcite . to write the total differential cross section for @xmath53 ( or , briefly , @xmath54 ) events , we follow the approach developed in refs .",
    "the differential cross section of the @xmath55 reaction in the center - of - mass system ( c.m.s . ) is given by their formula @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the spin - spin correlation tensor , and @xmath59 is the polarisation vector of the @xmath60 in the @xmath60 rest frame ( unit vector along the @xmath60 spin direction ) .",

    "there are several corrections that must be incorporated in the procedure to take into account the real experimental situation .",

    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) comprised of csi(tl ) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
