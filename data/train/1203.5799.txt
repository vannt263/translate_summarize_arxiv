    "x - ray observations by the _ suzaku _ satellite are confirming the existence of recombining supernova remnants ( snrs ) @xcite .",
    "recombining snrs are snrs in which the ionization temperature is higher than the electron temperature .",
    "the forward shock wave emerged at the time of a supernova ( sn ) explosion propagates in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "as the typical density of the ism is very small ( @xmath0 or less where @xmath1 is the electron number density ) , the timescale to reach collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) in the shocked ism is typically @xmath2 years or longer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "electrons heated by the coulomb interaction with ions in the shocked ism collisionally excite ions and reach cie with this timescale .",
    "thus , young snrs before cie are supposed to be ionizing snrs in which the electron temperature is higher than the ionization temperature and evolve to snrs in cie .",
    "most of snrs are known to be in either the ionizing stage or cie ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this simple picture , snrs can not be recombining snrs and the confirmation of the recombining snrs challenges the current understanding of the evolution of snrs .",
    "there are several suggested mechanisms to make recombining plasma in snrs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the existence of a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) is one possible way to explain the recombining snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if a dense csm is around a sn , cie can be achieved in much shorter timescale @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "when the shock wave reaches the outer edge of the dense csm , the shocked csm suddenly expands adiabatically and the electron temperature suddenly becomes low and the plasma starts to recombine .",
    "although the existence of the dense csm at the time of the sn explosion has been suggested as a possible mechanism to realize recombining snrs , we still do not have a clear picture about possible sn progenitors that can have a csm which is dense enough to make recombining snrs . here",
    "_ letter _ , we look into the properties of the csm around sn progenitors at the time of sn explosions and investigate the progenitors which can evolve to recombining snrs .",
    "we focus on massive star progenitors because two recombining snrs , ic 443 and w49b , are clearly associated with massive star forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but we also investigate possible channels for white dwarfs to be recombining snrs .",
    "red supergiants ( rsgs ) and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are progenitors of core - collapse sne . because of their high luminosities , they lose their mass before their explosions .",
    "thus , rsgs and wr stars explode inside the csm created by the preceding stellar evolution .",
    "if we assume that the csm is from a steady wind with the velocity @xmath4 and the mass - loss rate @xmath5 , the wind density @xmath6 becomes @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the radius .    if the star inside the csm explodes , a forward shock propagates in the csm .",
    "assuming that the adiabatic index of the system is @xmath9 , the density @xmath10 of the shocked csm just behind the forward shock becomes @xmath11 . as the forward shock propagates in the csm , it is decelerated , especially if the csm is dense .",
    "however , the mass of the csm swept up by the forward shock is still small compared to the progenitor mass in the early epochs we are interested in and we assume that it is freely expanding with the velocity @xmath12 for simplicity . note that the deceleration makes the time of the interaction between the shock wave and the csm longer and cie can be achieved easier with the deceleration .",
    "the typical @xmath12 of standard sn explosions is @xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the location of the forward shock at the time @xmath14 after the explosion is @xmath15 and @xmath10 can be expressed as @xmath16 although equation ( [ shockrho ] ) is the evolution of the density just behind the shock , the remaining entire shocked csm has similar densities when the shock is traveling in the density structure close to @xmath17 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and we assume that @xmath18 is a typical value in the shocked csm . the actual densities in the shocked csm are slightly higher than @xmath18 .    since the wind properties of rsgs and wr stars differ , we consider two cases separately .     and @xmath19 is fixed and lines with several mass - loss rates are shown .",
    "the distance in the horizontal axis is the distance which can be reached by the forward shock with @xmath20 in the corresponding time .",
    "if we assume that the progenitor is in the rsg stage for @xmath21 years before the explosion , the csm can reach @xmath22 pc with @xmath19 .",
    "the dashed line follows @xmath23 and corresponds to the minimum density required to reach cie at the time .",
    "shocked csm above this line is presumed to be at cie . ]",
    "the typical mass - loss rate and wind velocity of rsgs are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and they are consistent with those estimated from the observations of sn explosions from rsgs ( type iip sne , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if we assume that the rsg wind has the solar metallicity and h and he in the wind are fully ionized when the forward shock passes , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the electron number density in the shocked csm . from equation ( [ shockrho ] ) , the time evolution of @xmath27 is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is @xmath5 scaled by @xmath30 , @xmath31 is @xmath12 scaled by @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is @xmath4 scaled by @xmath34 .",
    "electrons and ions in plasma can reach cie with the timescale of @xmath35 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that only ions are presumed to be heated by the forward shock and electrons are heated up by the subsequent coulomb interaction between ions and electrons .",
    "the timescale of the electron heating is ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath38 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "although the timescale of temperature equilibrium is a few orders of magnitudes longer than that of cie , the electron temperature can reach about 10 % of the ion temperature ( @xmath39 k ) in the cie timescale @xcite and becomes high enough to explain the ionization temperature of recombining snrs .",
    "recombining plasma in snrs can appear if electrons cool down after cie is achieved ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ rsg ] shows the comparison of the evolution of the typical density in the shocked csm ( equation ( [ rsgnes ] ) ) and the cie timescale ( equation ( [ cie ] ) ) .",
    "cie can be achieved at early epochs of snrs from rsgs with the typical mass - loss rate if we take into account the existence of the csm .",
    "this is contrary to the general belief that it takes much time to be cie because snrs evolve in ism .",
    "note that @xmath12 in the early time is presumed to be higher than the value assumed in figure [ rsg ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and this effect can make the evolution of the electron number density faster .",
    "in addition , the mass of the recombining plasma estimated from figure [ rsg ] in the case of the standard mass loss is @xmath40 and rather small .",
    "massive rsgs , yellow supergiants , or rsgs in binary systems can have higher mass - loss rates than less massive rsgs especially just before their explosions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and they are more likely to become recombining snrs among rsgs .    the early x - ray observations of type iib sn 1993j whose progenitor is an rsg in a binary system ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) revealed the existence of the cie plasma at a few days since the explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the progenitor s mass - loss rate is suggested to be @xmath41 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with our estimate and explosions of rsgs can establish cie in the early epochs and evolve to recombining snrs .     and @xmath42 is fixed and lines with several mass - loss rates are shown .",
    "the distance in the horizontal axis is the distance which can be reached by the forward shock with @xmath20 in the corresponding time . if we assume that the progenitor is in the wr stage for @xmath21 years before the explosion , the csm can reach @xmath43 pc with @xmath42 .",
    "the dashed line follows @xmath23 and corresponds to the minimum density required to reach cie at the time .",
    "shocked csm above this line is presumed to be at cie . ]",
    "the typical mass - loss rate and wind velocity of wr stars are @xmath24 and @xmath44 , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if we assume that the wind from wr stars is composed of 50 % of carbon and 50 % of oxygen and they are fully ionized when the csm is shocked , @xmath45 . with these values , the following equation is obtained from equation ( [ shockrho ] ) : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is @xmath4 scaled by @xmath48 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath27 is compared to the cie timescale @xmath49 in figure [ wr ] . with the canonical mass - loss rate @xmath30 , the evolution of the shocked csm can be comparable to the cie timescale just after the explosion .",
    "however , @xmath12 is presumed to be larger than @xmath20 in the early epochs and the evolution of @xmath27 can be faster , as noted in the previous section .",
    "contrary to the case of rsgs , cie can be only established at the very early epochs with the optimistic @xmath12 and it is likely that cie is not achieved at early phases of the typical explosions of wr stars with the canonical mass - loss history .",
    "this is because the typical wind velocity is about 100 times larger than the typical rsg wind velocity and the csm becomes thin much faster .",
    "although recent radio observations of explosions of wr stars ( type ibc sne ) are revealing the existence of wr stars with high mass - loss rates ( @xmath50 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the amount of recombining plasma is very small ( @xmath51 , figure [ wr ] ) even if such a high mass - loss rate is maintained for the entire wr phase .",
    "thus , wr stars may be difficult to have dense csm which is massive enough to make them recombining snrs .",
    "since some elements can reach the cie in smaller timescales than @xmath49 at the typical temperature in the shocked csm @xcite , at least some elements may reach cie .",
    "in addition , it is also known that some wr stars experience explosive mass loss just before their explosions which can eject massive csm , as is indicated by the progenitor of type ib sn 2006jc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "explosions of this kind of wr stars can also result in recombining snrs but they are also expected to be rare .",
    "type iin sne are sne which show narrow spectral lines , especially of hydrogen , in optical spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "their spectral features can be explained by the existence of the dense csm with the thomson optical depth @xmath52 larger than @xmath22 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they can become luminous in x - ray and radio and some of them become luminous even in optical .",
    "the high luminosities of type iin sne can be naturally explained by the interaction between sn ejecta and its dense csm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the progenitors of type iin sne are a plausible candidate of the origin of recombining snrs .",
    "we assume that type iin sne have a dense csm with @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the thomson cross section , @xmath55 is the mean csm electron number density , and @xmath56 is the csm length .",
    "we use the mean density @xmath55 because the mass loss of type iin sn progenitors just before their explosions are revealed to be non - steady from x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "the shock wave with the velocity @xmath12 can propagate through the csm with @xmath57 .",
    "as csm or ism with much lower density exists outside the dense csm and the shocked csm is rarefied after the shock wave goes out of the dense csm , recombining plasma can be easily synthesized once the cie is achieved in the shocked csm . assuming @xmath58 and the solar metallicity",
    ", the typical timescale before the rarefaction is @xmath59 this is much larger than the timescale required to achieve the cie , @xmath60 . in reality",
    ", @xmath12 can be smaller than @xmath32 because of the deceleration by the dense csm but this makes @xmath61 longer .",
    "one caveat is that we use a constant mean electron density @xmath55 to estimate the density evolution .",
    "if the density declines very steeply , this assumption can be very crude and type iin sne from very steep csm may not end up with recombining snrs .",
    "nonetheless , many type iin sne have flat density csm @xcite and we presume that most of type iin sne can end up with recombining snrs .",
    "however , as explosions of rsgs ( type ii sne ) occurs much more frequently than type iin sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the major progenitors of recombining snrs are likely to be rsgs .    unfortunately , the progenitors of type iin sne are not understood well . @xcite",
    "have confirmed that the progenitor of a type iin sn , sn 2005gl , is a luminous blue variable ( lbv , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as lbvs originate from very massive stars ( more than @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the zero - age main - sequence mass , e.g. , @xcite ) and the observational rate of type iin sne is also consistent with the mass range of lbvs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , type iin sne are suggested to come mainly from these very massive stars .",
    "however , it is theoretically considered that lbvs are in an evolutionary stage in which very massive stars evolve to wr stars and lbvs do not explode .",
    "it is also possible that the fast wind from a wr star collides to the slowly moving wind from its previous rsg stage and a dense shell which is enough to be a type iin sn is created by the interaction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another possible type iin sn progenitor is a super - asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star with @xmath64 .",
    "an o+ne+mg core at the center of the super - agb wind can be an electron - capture sn @xcite .",
    "the progenitor of type iin sn 2008s is found to be around @xmath65 @xcite and may belong to this class ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) but there also exists an argument that sn 2008s may not be an sn @xcite . finally , we note that some of type ic superluminous sne recently discovered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are related to the interaction of a dense c+o - rich csm and sn ejecta @xcite and they can also be a progenitor of recombining snrs . however , type ic superluminous sne preferentially appear in metal - poor galaxies @xcite and the occurrence rate is also quite small . thus , recombining snrs currently observed in our galaxy seem irrelevant to them .",
    "although most of the recombining snrs currently discovered are likely to originate from core - collapse sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , type ia sne can also evolve to recombining snrs although it is expected to be quite rare .",
    "type ia sne are explosions of white dwarfs .",
    "there are two major suggested paths for white dwarfs to explode : single degenerate ( sd ) channel ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and double degenerate ( dd ) channel ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the sd scenario ,",
    "a white dwarf is in a binary system with a main - sequence star and the mass of the companion accretes to the white dwarf .",
    "the white dwarf explodes when its mass gets close to the chandrasekhar mass limit . on the other hand",
    ", the dd scenario suggests that type ia sne are caused by the merger of two white dwarfs in a binary system .",
    "the main channel of type ia sne is still unknown .    in the sd scenario ,",
    "the exploding white dwarf is surrounded by the accreting materials with a typical rate of @xmath66 @xcite but the rate is presumed to be too small to make the recombining snr . mass loss from the companion star can also make csm around the progenitor but the companion is likely to be a less evolved red giant with too small mass - loss rates to establish cie ( @xmath67 or less , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there are rare ways to make the mass - loss rate of the system high during the binary evolution @xcite and some type ia sne are actually suggested to be a hybrid of type ia and type iin , i.e. , type ia sne exploded in a csm as dense as those discussed in section [ sec : iin ] ( e.g. , sn 2002ic , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it is possible that a type ia sn from the sd scenario evolve to a recombining snr but the number is expected to be very small .    in the dd scenario",
    ", we do not expect the csm from the progenitor system because two binary stars are white dwarfs .",
    "however , stripped materials at the time of the merger are suggested to remain when the merged white dwarf explodes @xcite .",
    "these materials are quite dense ( @xmath68 within @xmath69 , see figure 5 of @xcite ) and type ia sne exploded in such environment can reach cie and may end up with recombining snrs .",
    "however , such a dense envelope is not obtained in a similar dd simulation of @xcite .",
    "the fact that we do not see recombining snrs of type ia sne may already suggest that the model obtained by @xcite is not the major path to be a type ia sn . because of the uncertainty in the theoretical prediction of type ia sne from the dd scenario , we still can not exclude the possibility that type ia sne from the dd scenario can be recombining snrs .    to sum up ,",
    "although all the recombining snrs currently discovered are likely from core - collapse sne , type ia sne from both the sd and dd channels have possibility to become recombining snrs .",
    "when the detailed theoretical predictions are fixed , like the existence of the dense envelope in the dd channel , recombining snrs may be able to be a probe to indicate the progenitor system of type ia sne .",
    "we have investigated the possible progenitors of recombining snrs .",
    "if a csm which is dense enough to establish cie in the early epochs of the snr evolution exists around a progenitor , the plasma in the shocked csm can be overionized and the snr can become a recombining snr .",
    "rsgs , especially massive ones , and type iin sn progenitors can have the csm which is dense enough to establish cie at the early stage of their explosions and can evolve to recombining snrs . as explosions of rsgs ( type ii sne ) occurs much more frequently than type iin sne , the major progenitors of recombining snrs are likely to be rsgs .",
    "wr stars and white dwarfs are difficult to make recombining snrs with their standard mass - loss histories but they are suggested to have mechanisms to enhance their mass - loss rates and they can be recombining snrs if such mechanisms enhance their mass - loss rates . however , these mechanisms are presumed to work on a small fraction of these stars and such progenitors are expected to be a minor way to have recombining snrs .",
