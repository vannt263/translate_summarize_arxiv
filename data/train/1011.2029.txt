    "consider a mc with mass @xmath5 at a distance @xmath6 , located in a region in the galaxy where the cr ( protons ) intensity is @xmath7 . for illustrative purpose , we set here @xmath8 .",
    "we further assume that the high energy crs ( the ones with energy above the threshold for @xmath9-production ) can freely penetrate the cloud@xcite . under these assumptions the expected gamma ray flux from the mc due to proton - proton interactions",
    "is given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the interaction cross section , @xmath12 is the proton mass , and @xmath13 depends on @xmath14 and is tabulated in ref .  .",
    "equation  [ flux ] is valid at high energies only ( @xmath15 ) , while at lower energies the spectrum ( in log - log scale ) is symmetric with respect to the energy @xmath16 .",
    "assume now that the cr intensity in the region under exam differs by a factor @xmath17 from the one measured at the earth ( which is:@xcite @xmath18 ) , so that equation  [ flux ] can be rewritten as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass of the mc in units of @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the distance in kpc , and @xmath23 takes into account the fact that on average crs with energy @xmath0 produce gamma rays with energy @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , a multiplicative factor of 1.5 has been applied to account for the contribution to the emission from nuclei heavier than h both in crs and in the mc gas .",
    "if gamma rays are detected from a mc , and its mass and distance are known from its co emission@xcite , then equation  [ barometer ] allows one to measure both  the spectrum and intensity of crs at the mc s location , and thus the quantity @xmath25 .",
    "it follows that mcs can be effectively used as probes of the energy density of crs at different locations in the galaxy , and for this reason have been sometimes referred to as _",
    "cr barometers_. @xcite since observations in the  gev range of the galaxy suggest that , on large spatial scales , cr variations are not very large , @xcite @xmath25 is normally interpreted as the excess above the galactic cr background . some examples of how to use this fact to estimate the cr diffusion coefficient are given in the following sections .",
    "the h.e.s.s . collaboration reported on the detection of diffuse gamma ray emission from the galactic centre ( gc ) ridge .",
    "@xcite remarkably , the emission correlates spatially with a complex of giant mcs , suggesting that the emission itself is likely to be originated by cr hadronic interactions in the dense ambient gas .",
    "the tev gamma ray spectrum extracted from the region of galactic coordinates @xmath26 , @xmath27 can be fitted by a power law with index @xmath28 and normalization @xmath29 . at the distance of the gc ( @xmath30 )",
    "the emitting region has a size of @xmath31 , and encloses a total gas mass of @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite    by assuming that all the observed gamma ray emission has an hadronic origin , we can use equation  [ barometer ] to show that , close to the gc , the cr intensity at 10 tev is enhanced with respect to the local one by a factor of @xmath33 , and grows at higher energies due to the hardness of the measured emission .",
    "moreover , the total energy in form of crs needed to explain  the emission is @xmath34 , if the observed spectrum is extrapolated from 1  gev to 1  pev .",
    "thus , a single snr with explosion energy @xmath35 and acceleration efficiency @xmath36 might explain the whole cr excess in the region .",
    "@xcite    one possible cr accelerator is the snr sgr a east , located close to the gc and with an estimated ( but uncertain ) age of @xmath37 .",
    "if  the crs responsible for the observed emission are assumed to be released during  the earliest phase of the snr evolution , then it is possible to estimate the diffusion coefficient by requiring them to fill the emitting region of size @xmath38 in a time @xmath39 .",
    "this gives @xmath40 , which , taking into account the large uncertainties in the assumptions made , is in rough agreement with ( maybe somewhat smaller than @xcite ) the value of the diffusion coefficient of @xmath41 tev crs in the galactic disk .",
    "the presence of a massive mc at @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) which does not show prominent gamma ray emission suggests that crs accelerated at the gc have not diffused yet up to that distance , and this justifies our assumption for @xmath44 .",
    "@xcite    this estimate of the diffusion coefficient has to be regarded as a very rough one , due to the presence of many uncertainties in its derivation .",
    "for example , another source ( e.g. the black hole sgr a@xmath45 @xcite ) , or many sources ( e.g. an ensemble of snrs @xcite ) might be the accelerators of the crs responsible for the tev emission . moreover , proton energy losses ( ignored here ) might affect the estimate of the diffusion coefficient by a factor of @xmath46 .",
    "@xcite    better constraints on the diffusion coefficient and on the nature of the source(s ) of the accelerated particles could be obtained if the spatial variation of the spectrum of the gamma ray emission was known .",
    "measuring such variation , though challenging for currently operating instruments , is within the capabilities of future ones like the cherenkov telescope array .",
    "it seems thus appropriate to discuss the future perspectives in this direction .    according to the scenario summarized above , the snr sgr  a east , located close to the gc , released about @xmath47 in form of crs about 10  kyr ago . since high energy crs",
    "are believed to be accelerated by young snrs ( aged up to few thousands years ) , we are allowed to consider this as an impulsive injection event .",
    "if crs are injected with a power law spectrum @xmath48 , their time dependent spatial distribution around the source is : @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50(@xmath51 ) is the maximum ( minimum ) cr energy , @xmath52 is a diffusion length and @xmath53 the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the cr intensity is the sum of equation  [ atoyan ] and the galactic cr background .",
    "( solid ) and @xmath54 ( dashed ) .",
    "horizontal lines represent the observed slope ( measured value @xmath55 error ) .",
    "dotted vertical lines delimit the emitting region .",
    "arrows refer to the positions of the peaks in the gas distribution.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the expected excess over the background for crs with energy 3 tev  is shown in figure  [ fig : excess ] ( top panel ) as a function of galactic longitude .",
    "these are the crs that produce most of the emission detected above @xmath56 in the region @xmath26 ( marked by dotted vertical lines in figure  [ fig : excess ] ) .",
    "the slope of the gamma ray emissivity at 300 gev and for a diffusion coefficient @xmath57 with @xmath58 is plotted as a solid line in the bottom panel , where it is compared with the measured one , represented by the horizontal dotted lines ( measured slope @xmath55 statistical error ) .",
    "the arrows represent the ( projected ) position of the four prominent peaks in the gas density distribution .",
    "if the total gas mass is concentrated at these locations and if projection effects in the gas distribution do not play an important role , the spectral slope of the emissivity should roughly represent the observed slope also .",
    "the results in figure  [ fig : excess ] can be interpreted as follows . within roughly one diffusion length",
    ", the gamma ray spectrum hardens with the distance from the source .",
    "this is because higher energy crs occupy a larger volume of space around the source , and thus the low energy emission is progressively suppressed at larger and larger distances . on the other hand , at distances",
    "much larger than one diffusion length , the cr excess vanishes and the steep spectrum characteristic of the cr background is recovered .",
    "though these calculations are far too crude , they might still serve to estimate the order of magnitude of the expected spectral variations within the emitting region . from figure",
    "[ fig : excess ] one sees that variations of the order of @xmath59 are expected for a diffusion coefficient with slope @xmath58 .",
    "a stronger dependency on energy would produce more pronounced variations , as illustrated by the dashed line which refers to @xmath60 .",
    "values of @xmath61 significantly larger than 0.3 would require a harder injection spectrum of crs in order to preserve the observed slope in gamma rays .",
    "such variations in the slope of the emission , if detected , would support the scenario of a localized injection of crs close to the gc and provide better constraints on the diffusion coefficient .",
    "complementary studies of the three dimensional distribution of the gas in the region are also needed in order to control projection effects .",
    "w28 is a snr in its radiative phase of evolution , located at a distance  of @xmath62 , in a region rich of dense molecular gas .",
    "gamma ray emission has been detected from the surroundings of w28 both at tev @xcite and gev energies @xcite , by hess , fermi , and agile , respectively .",
    "the tev emission correlates quite well with the position of three massive ( @xmath63 ) mcs , one of which is interacting with the north - eastern part of the shell ( and corresponds to the tev source hess j1801 - 233 ) , and the other two being located to the south of the snr ( tev sources hess j1800 - 240 a and b ) .",
    "let us assume that this gamma ray emission is the result of hadronic interactions of crs that have been accelerated at the snr and then escaped in the surrounding medium.@xcite in this scenario , the distribution of runaway crs around the snr is still given by equation  [ atoyan ] .",
    "a diffusion coefficient @xmath64 is assumed , where @xmath65 represents possible deviations with respect to the average diffusion coefficient in the galaxy .",
    "equation  [ atoyan ] tells us that , up to a distance equal to the diffusion radius @xmath66 , the spatial distribution of crs around the source is roughly constant , and given by @xmath67 . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed gamma ray flux from each one of the mcs is : @xmath68 . by using the definitions of @xmath69 and @xmath66 we can finally write the approximate equation , valid within a distance @xmath66 from the snr : @xmath70 estimates",
    "can be obtained from observations for all the physical quantities in equation  [ eq : w28 ] except for the cr acceleration efficiency @xmath71 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath72 . by fitting the tev data we can thus attempt to constrain a combination of these two parameters ( namely @xmath73 ) . given all the uncertainties above",
    ", our results have to be interpreted as a proof of concept of the fact that gamma ray observations can serve as tools to estimate the diffusion coefficient .",
    "more detections of snr / mc associations are needed in order to check whether the scenario described here applies to a whole class of objects and not only to a test - case as w28 .",
    "future observations from the cherenkov telescope array will most likely solve this issue .",
    "figure [ fig : w28 ] shows a simultaneous fit to the hess data for the three massive mcs in the w28 region , obtained by setting @xmath74 .",
    "this implies that the normalized diffusion coefficient @xmath65 has to be much smaller than 1 for any reasonable value of @xmath75 .",
    "for example , an acceleration efficiency @xmath76 corresponds to @xmath77 , which in turn gives a diffusion distance for tev particles of @xmath78 .",
    "this means that the results in figure  [ fig : w28 ] are valid if the physical ( not projected ) distances between the mcs and the snrs do not significantly exceed @xmath66 .",
    "small values of the diffusion coefficient have been also proposed in ref .  .",
    "note that , since we are considering gamma rays in a quite narrow energy band around @xmath79  tev , we are actually constraining the diffusion coefficient of crs with energy @xmath80  tev . with some caveats",
    "@xcite , observations in the gev range might be used to constrain the diffusion coefficient down to gev particle energies .",
    "the snr ic443 has an estimated age of @xmath81 , explosion energy of @xmath82 , and distance @xmath83.@xcite it has been detected at both gev @xcite and tev @xcite energies .",
    "a power law fit to the tev emission is : @xmath84 .",
    "observations of the co line indicate that about @xmath85 of molecular gas are present in the region .",
    "@xcite though the gev emission might be explained as the emission from shocked clouds,@xcite this scenario can not account for the very high energy crs that originate the tev photons .",
    "if these photons are produced by runaway crs we can attempt to estimate the diffusion coefficient , as done for w28 .",
    "if the tev radiation is produced in a mc of mass @xmath86 , then from equation  [ barometer ] we can infer an excess in the intensty of multi - tev crs of the order of @xmath87 . if these particles had time to diffuse up to a distance @xmath66 , their total ( integrated over volume ) energy is @xmath88 ( see equation  [ atoyan ] ) .",
    "this number has to be multiplied by @xmath89 to account for the extension of the spectrum of crs injected by the snr and then equated to @xmath90 .",
    "this gives ( very roughly ) a diffusion coefficient for multi - tev crs of @xmath91 .",
    "this is , again , much smaller than the average diffusion coefficient in the galaxy , @xcite and corresponds to @xmath92 .",
    "other snr / mc associations detected in tev gamma rays that would deserve attention include ctb 37a , hess j1745 - 303 , and w51 .",
    "@xcite the approach described here might now be extended to the gev range , where several snr / mc associations are being detected by fermi.@xcite the cygnus region , rich of dense gas and detected at multi - tev energies , also promises to be an ideal region of the sky for this kind of studies .",
    "mcs , when detected in gamma rays , can serve as probes of the cr intensity throughout the galaxy .",
    "if they are located close to cr sources , the intensity of the gamma ray emission might impose constraints on the local diffusion coefficient . in at least one case ( snr w28 )",
    ", preliminary evidence has been reported for a significant suppression of the diffusion coefficient with respect to the average galactic one .",
    "this suppression might be the result of an enhancement in the magnetic turbulence due to the streaming of crs away from the source .",
    "observations with future facilities such as the cherenkov telescope array will conclusively test the feasibility and reliability of the approach to constrain cr diffusion that has been presented here .",

    "<S> this is because the observed properties of crs results from the equilibrium between the injection rate of crs from sources and their diffusive escape from the galaxy </S>",
