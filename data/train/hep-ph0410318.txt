    "the observed neutrino oscillations @xcite are a clear indication for non - vanishing neutrino masses and violation of individual lepton numbers .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) offers many possibilities to describe the observed neutrino data .",
    "the most popular one is certainly the usual seesaw mechanism @xcite , which introduces heavy right - handed neutrinos carrying a @xmath0 lepton number violating majorana mass . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "a large @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing can lead to a large @xmath3-@xmath4 mixing via renormalisation group equations @xcite .",
    "an additional source of lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) arise in models where the mssm with r - parity conservation is embedded in a gut theory @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of having leptons and quarks in the same gut multiplet .",
    "the quark flavour mixing due to the ckm matrix leaves its traces also in the leptonic sector @xcite .",
    "therefore , one expects flavour violating effects for charged leptons .",
    "furthermore , in analogy to quarks , lepton flavour violation may also be related to cp violation .",
    "lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) in the charged lepton sector is , however , severely constrained by the stringent experimental bounds on the branching ratios @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and rare processes such as @xmath8 conversion @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , clear lfv signals are expected in slepton and sneutrino production and in the decays of neutralinos , charginos , sleptons and sneutrinos at the lhc and at future lepton colliders @xcite despite these stringent constraints .",
    "we will discuss such scenarios in the first half of this report .",
    "supersymmetry offers an interesting option to accommodate for the observed neutrino data which is intrinsically supersymmetric : the breaking of r - parity .",
    "adding bilinear terms to the mssm superpotential is the simplest way to realize this idea in practice .",
    "it has been shown that in this way neutrino data can by successfully explained ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein )",
    ". moreover it has been demonstrated that various decay properties of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) are correlated with neutrino properties , in particular with neutrino mixing angles @xcite .",
    "we will discuss such correlations taking the lightest neutralino as lsp as well as the possibilities to measure these correlations at the lhc .",
    "we will first discuss the case of conserved r - parity where total lepton number is conserved but individual lepton is violated . in the absence of right - handed neutrinos one can work without loss of generality in a basis where the lepton yukawa couplings are real and diagonal .",
    "in this basis the complete information on lfv is encoded in the mass matrices of the charged sleptons and of the sneutrinos : @xmath9 where the entries in @xmath10 are @xmath11 matrices that are given by @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the soft susy breaking mass matrices for left and right sleptons , respectively , and the @xmath15 are the trilinear soft susy breaking couplings of the sleptons and higgs boson , @xmath16 and the @xmath17 are the usual @xmath16 parameter and the lepton yukawa couplings such that @xmath18 .",

    "for this reason we fix the diagonal entries of these matrices as well as the other supersymmetric parameters by using the original high scale definition of the snowmass point sps#1a @xcite : @xmath22  gev , @xmath23  gev , @xmath24  gev , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . at the electroweak scale",

    "one of the mass squared parameters is at least one order of magnitude larger than all the others .",

    "[ fig : chi2decays ] we show examples of lepton flavour violating decays modes of the second lightest neutralino where we have summed over the intermediate slepton states . as can be seen these branching ratios can go up to 40% .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that lepton number violating decay chains can be identified despite the considerable background processes stemming from decays of supersymmetric particles .",
    "this implies that lepton number violation in supersymmetric decays can be explored at the lhc .",
    "in addition these decay modes are important for the lhc when one considers the so - called edge variables discussed in @xcite .",
    "these variables are extracted from decay chains such as @xmath43 and are very useful to measure not only mass differences of supersymmetric particles but also the mass of the lightest supersymmetric particle .",
    "the effect of the lfv modes is two - fold : on the one hand the reduce final states containing @xmath44 and @xmath45 pairs which might deteriorate the accuracy of the mass measurements of selectrons and smuons . on the other hand",
    "the could increase the accuracy of the stau mass measurements as the final states do not not only contain @xmath46 pairs but also @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "finally we want to remark that in scenarios with large lepton number violation the discovery reach of lhc could be enlarged taking sps1a as example . in this scenario",
    "the discovery of the lightest chargino is very difficult if not impossible at lhc @xcite because the chargino decays with nearly 100% as follows : @xmath49 . in case of sizable lepton number violation in the right slepton sector",
    "the lighter stau can have large branching ratios into @xmath50 or @xmath16 final states .",
    "we have found that in the above scanned parameter space the sum of the branching ratios br@xmath51 + br@xmath52 can go up to 20% even in case where the branching ratios for rare @xmath53 decays are at a level of @xmath54 .",
    "this could enhance considerably the discovery potential for the lightest chargino in this scenario .",
    "in supersymmetric theories majorana mass terms for left - handed neutrinos can be induced by introducing lepton - number and , thus , r - parity breaking terms in the superpotential .",
    "adding bilinear terms to the mssm superpotential is the simplest way to realize this idea in practice explaining successfully neutrino data ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in such a scenario an effective seesaw mechanism takes place where the neutralinos play the role of the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "this implies that various decay properties of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) are correlated with neutrino properties , in particular with neutrino mixing angles @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of the model is obtained by adding bilinear terms breaking lepton number to the mssm superpotential and consistently the corresponding terms to the soft susy breaking potential : @xmath55 the latter induce vacuum expectation values @xmath56 for the sneutrinos which are in turn responsible for mixing between standard model particles with supersymmetric particles .",
    "the mixing of neutrinos with neutralinos gives rise to one massive neutrino at tree level .",
    "the other two neutrinos obtain masses due to loop effects @xcite . assuming that the heaviest neutrino obtains its mass at tree level , the main features relevant for our current purpose are the following : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle , @xmath59 is the solar neutrino mixing angle and @xmath60 is the tree level neutrino mixing matrix @xcite .",

    "this implies that the r - parity violating parameters are significantly smaller than the r - parity conserving ones : @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this feature allows for the possibility that all r - parity violating couplings can be expanded in terms of the ratios@xcite @xmath63 this implies that the neutrino mixing angles in eq .",
