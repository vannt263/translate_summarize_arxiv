    "massive galaxies and galaxy clusters at high redshift provide strong constraints on cosmological models and galaxy formation scenarios . the lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) are a widespread population of high redshift galaxies selected by their rest - frame fuv colors @xcite .",
    "lbgs at @xmath14 tend to reside in massive halos @xmath15 @xcite and are therefore believed to evolve into present - day massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "although @xmath16 color - selected @xmath17 lbgs have spectroscopic confirmations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , only two systems , selected by their radio emission , have been spectroscopically identified as potential brightest cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "we report the discovery of a bright , m@xmath0 , rest - frame fuv color - selected lbg ( hereafter lbg-2377 ) at @xmath1 .",
    "ground - based imaging and spectroscopy finds no evidence for agn activity or gravitational lensing making this the most luminous @xmath18 lbg discovered to date .",
    "the deep images and high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) spectroscopy show evidence for multiple massive components indicative of a system in the late stage of merging .",
    "we show that the component velocity dispersion and integrated fuv luminosity suggest that lbg-2377 resides in a very massive halo ( @xmath19 ) and is likely to evolve into a present - day massive brightest cluster galaxy (   [ sim ] ) .",
    "therefore , lbg-2377 provides a rare opportunity to study the dynamics and properties of a massive lbg halo in the process of formation .",
    "all @xmath18 lbgs with @xmath20 discovered to date are magnified by gravitational lensing . because all of these show ly-@xmath21 in absorption , they are representative of the spectral properties observed in @xmath225 - 50% of the lbg population @xcite .",
    "lbg-2377 displays strong ly-@xmath21 in emission in two of its components and , because of its brightness , is the only system of its kind .",
    "the luminosity of lbg-2377 enables high snr study of its individual components and thereby a means to constrain the observed range of lbg spectral properties .",
    "we briefly describe the imaging and spectroscopic observations of lbg-2377 in  [ obs ] , highlight the initial analysis of the data in  [ analysis ] , and present a discussion in  [ disc ] .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab @xcite magnitude system unless otherwise noted and we assume an @xmath22 , @xmath23 cosmology and use comoving units throughout .",
    "the deep images of the qso pc1643 + 4631a field were obtained on 2001 april 18 using the low - resolution imaging spectrometer @xcite mounted on the keck i telescope as part of a multi - field survey for lbgs associated with damped ly-@xmath21 systems at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "specifically , the field containing lbg-2377 was imaged in the @xmath24bvr@xmath25 is the h. spinrad high - throughout night - sky r filter publicly available at the w. m. keck observatory .",
    "the transformation from spinrad night - sky r@xmath25 into johnson vr is ( r@xmath25 - r ) = -0.004 - 0.072(v - r ) + 0.073(v - r)@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "all r@xmath25 magnitudes presented here have been transformed into the johnson r bandpass.]i filters with seeing of @xmath27 arcsec and a depth of @xmath28 and bvri @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we discovered lbg-2377 as an r @xmath31 @xmath14 lbg candidate at r.a .",
    "16:44:48.3 , dec.+46:27:08.2 ( j2000.0 ) toward one edge of the imaged field .",
    "the isophotal magnitudes as determined using @xmath32 @xcite source extraction code are : @xmath33 , b @xmath34 , v @xmath35 , r @xmath36 , and i @xmath37 .",
    "lbgs at @xmath13 have a half - light radius of @xmath38 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as illustrated in the contour plot shown in figure  [ fig : contour ] , lbg-2377 spans @xmath39 and has a morphology that can be interpreted as a single extended system exhibiting multiple vigorous star forming regions or multiple separate near - point sources .",
    "the ratio of the peaks of the three strongest identified components is approximately 10:5:1 with separations of @xmath2@xmath40 ( @xmath41 kpc , comoving ) .",
    "inspection of the deep images shows that there are no significant lensing - source candidates within @xmath42 . a potential candidate @xmath43 from lbg-2377 ( r.a .",
    "16:44:46.5 , dec + 46:27:04.1 ) does have an effective redshift for lensing ( @xmath44 ) , but would need a halo mass of @xmath45 to provide a significant ( @xmath46 ) magnification boost @xcite .",
    "moreover , such a geometry would result in a large distortion of the lbg-2377 image .",
    "we see no evidence for this in the deep ground - based images .",
    "lbg-2377 was confirmed to be a @xmath1 galaxy from low - resolution discovery multi - object spectroscopy on 2004 february 18 @xcite .",
    "the data were taken using the 300 line mm@xmath7 grism on lris with a spectral resolution of @xmath47   fwhm .",
    "we acquired follow - up higher resolution , higher snr longslit spectroscopic observations with lris on 21 may 2007 using the 600 line mm@xmath7 grism blazed at 4000  with the blue arm and the 1200 line mm@xmath7 blazed at 7500   with the red arm .",
    "we used five 1800s exposures in our final combined spectrum that resulted in a snr of @xmath48 and a resolution of @xmath49(figure  [ fig:600 ] ) .",
    "details of the observations will appear in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the spectrum of lbg-2377 is dominated by o and b star continua and displays strong ly-@xmath21 emission and little reddening .",
    "these features are consistent with the general properties of the @xmath14 lbg population that display ly-@xmath21 in emission @xcite .",
    "although the ly-@xmath21 feature appears as a single emission line in the low - resolution discovery spectrum , the higher - resolution high snr spectroscopy reveals two strong peaks with two possible weak peaks more evident in the individual spectra .",
    "the rest - frame fuv shows a complex series of interstellar atomic lines exhibiting gas absorption over velocities @xmath50 km s@xmath7 and evidence for @xmath5 components . over 20 fuv ism absorption lines",
    "were used to identify and study individual components .",
    "we identified @xmath515 photospheric lines ( to varying confidence levels ) of each component to estimate their systemic redshifts .",
    "these lines include : siiii @xmath52 , 1296.73 , 1417.24 , ciii @xmath53 , 1427.85 cii @xmath541323.93 , niii @xmath55 , oiv @xmath56 , and sv @xmath57 .",
    "the strongest components have redshifts @xmath58 , and 3.0244 .",
    "we find a 1-d velocity dispersion of @xmath59 km s@xmath7 for these three components and @xmath60 km s@xmath7 for the five components .",
    "the details of the identified components are listed in table  [ comp ] .",
    "we note that the ly-@xmath21 emission and ism absorption lines of the lbg population show observed velocity offsets of @xmath61 and @xmath62 km sec@xmath7 from their systemic velocities , respectively @xcite .",
    "the ly-@xmath21 and ism offsets in the identified components are consistent with that of the lbg population .",
    "the accepted interpretation is that these offsets are caused by the presence of an expanding galactic - scale shell of gas and dust driven by supernovae and stellar winds .",
    "ly-@xmath21 photons are largely absorbed in the approaching shell but are resonantly scattered off the receding portion and survive . in this scenario , the two prominent ly-@xmath21 peaks observed in the spectrum of lbg-2377 would trace two distinct expanding galactic - scale shells with a systemic velocity difference of @xmath63 km sec@xmath7 .",
    "our fit to the components in table  [ comp ] is shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "although the spectra of the components are superposed , the ism absorption - line strengths and behavior of each component appear internally consistent with being separate systems .",
    "the high luminosity and complex structure of lbg-2377 suggest that this system may be a brightest cluster galaxy in formation . here",
    "we investigate this possibility in the context of @xmath8cdm .",
    "we estimate the dark matter halo mass of lbg-2377 using both its measured kinematics and luminosity .",
    "encouragingly , both estimates suggest a group - scale mass @xmath64 .",
    "if we assume an nfw halo , our measured @xmath6 km s@xmath7 1-d velocity dispersion corresponds to a halo maximum circular velocity of @xmath65 , or @xmath66 km s@xmath7 @xcite . at @xmath67",
    "this implies @xmath68 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . alternatively ,",
    "if we assume a simple monotonic relationship between galaxy luminosity and dark matter halo @xmath69 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and use the @xmath13 lbg luminosity function @xcite , the number density of objects similar to lbg-2377 ( m@xmath0 ) is @xmath70 mpc@xmath71 .",
    "this number density corresponds to halos with @xmath72 km s@xmath7 at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the agreement between these two estimates suggests that lbg-2377 does indeed sit within a massive @xmath66 km s@xmath7 halo .",
    "halos that are this massive at @xmath10 almost certainly contain substructure .",
    "we illustrate this explicitly by examining the high - resolution 80 @xmath73 mpc@xmath74 @xmath8cdm n - body simulation described in @xcite .",
    "there are three halos in this box with @xmath75 km s@xmath7 at @xmath10 ( specifically , @xmath76 and @xmath77 km sec@xmath7 ) .",
    "these objects have between five and eight @xmath78 sub - halos within their ( physical ) virial radii @xmath79 kpc @xmath80 .",
    "note that this substructure mass is typical of that expected for lbg hosts at @xmath13 ( @xmath8110@xmath82 * ? ? ?",
    "if we look at simulated halos that are significantly smaller than our estimate , we find that only two out of 16 objects with @xmath83 km sec@xmath7 in the simulation have no sub - halos with @xmath84 .",
    "we conclude that it would be very unlikely for an object like lbg-2377 to exist _ without _ multiple components .    by following the merger trees of our three @xmath85 km sec@xmath7 halos",
    ", we find that they evolve from @xmath86 halos at @xmath10 to cluster - mass systems with @xmath87 at @xmath12 .",
    "these are among the @xmath88 most massive halos in the box at @xmath12 and contain @xmath89 sub - halos larger than @xmath90 .",
    "this analysis suggests that lbg-2377 will evolve into the dominant galaxy within a large group or cluster by the present day .",
    "the double peak nature of the ly-@xmath21 feature in lbg-2377 was only detected with higher resolution and snr .",
    "however , multiple ly-@xmath21 peaks are not unique to lbg-2377 . in the lbg spectroscopic survey of @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath91% of the low - resolution spectra to display double ly-@xmath21 emission peaks and resolved double peaks in their deep image profiles .",
    "we can only assume that this fraction increases with higher resolution or snr .",
    "one example of this effect may be found in the sample of @xcite .",
    "of the nine deep high snr lbg spectra with ly-@xmath21 in emission , three have double peaks .",
    "two of the remaining six have redshifts within @xmath92 and a separation of @xmath93 and are consistent with a double - peak system at a larger angular separation .",
    "interestingly , upon inspection of the average internal velocity differences between the ly-@xmath21 emission and ism absorption features ( @xmath94 ) , the single peak systems are reported to have @xmath95550 km sec@xmath7 , whereas the double peak systems have @xmath96 km sec@xmath7 .",
    "km sec@xmath7 . if the absorption features of the lower redshift systems are weak or narrow in this interpretation , adopting a typical @xmath97 for the that system would result in @xmath98 km sec@xmath7 for the assumed two components . ]",
    "one plausible interpretation of this discrepancy is the result of the velocity separations , and consequent spectral blending , of two individual interacting systems . confirming separate components in lbgs showing only ly-@xmath21 in absorption is more difficult .",
    "however , there are indications of separate components in the intermediate - resolution , high snr spectrum of ms1512-cb58 @xcite .",
    "the prediction implied is that with higher snr and/or resolution , a significant fraction , possibly as high as @xmath99% , of lbgs with ly-@xmath21 in emission have multiple massive components and may indeed be separate interacting or merging systems .",
    "this result would be consistent with the fraction of expected major mergers at @xmath14 from numerical simulations ) , and with galaxy formation theories that suggest mergers are an important contributor to the star formation activity in lbgs @xcite .",
    "what is the nature of lbg-2377 ?",
    "possible interpretations are that lbg-2377 represents either ( 1 ) a single extended lbg with @xmath100 exhibiting multiple regions of vigorous star formation , ( 2 ) a single , extended lbg with mass more typical of lbgs ( @xmath101 ) that appears over - luminous due to exceptionally high bursts of star formation , ( 3 ) multiple unbound @xmath102 lbgs in near proximity , or ( 4 ) multiple lbgs in a @xmath103 halo observed in a late stage of merging .",
    "we discuss each scenario below and show that the evidence gathered to date favors interpretation 4 .",
    "if the component stellar photospheric lines are misidentified and the complex nature of the ism absorption and ly-@xmath21 emission lines are ascribed to violent mixing of the ism and discrete star forming regions separated by @xmath104 kpc , interpretation 1 may hold .",
    "however , a single @xmath105 halo with no massive sub - halos is in conflict with simulation results . in this interpretation",
    ", lbg-2377 is indeed a massive and extended system that appears to be experiencing a monolithic burst of star formation . under interpretation 2",
    ", lbg-2377 would be in less conflict with simulations yet the above assumptions for stellar and ism lines must hold . in this case",
    ", lbg-2377 is a single system undergoing an unusually strong star formation episode at a level that has not been witnessed in any other lbg .",
    "in addition , this exceptional star formation must be occurring in multiple regions separated by @xmath104 kpc .",
    "if the velocity offsets are interpreted as redshifts , as in interpretation 3 , the systems would have separations of @xmath106 mpc comoving .",
    "an event of three or more unbound systems with @xmath101 , @xmath107 angular separations , and an lbg density of @xmath108 mpc@xmath109 has a vanishingly low probability , even if the systems were given reasonable peculiar velocities .",
    "the most likely scenario is interpretation 4 because it is consistent with the extended nature and multiple peaks seen in the images , the superposed spectra of multiple identified components , the observed velocity dispersion , and the expectations from the simulation .",
    "in addition , this interpretation provides a natural driver for the observed star formation and bright integrated luminosity .",
    "furthermore , the double ly-@xmath21 emission peak of lbg-2377 is also seen in other lbgs which exhibit two distinct components in their deep images and ly-@xmath21 emission - line velocity differences consistent with close galaxy pairs .",
    "lbg-2377 is a fortuitous discovery that enables detailed study of the individual components of a candidate massive galaxy in the late stage of merging .",
    "study of the relationships between the spectral and spatial properties of this single system will constrain the formation processes of the lbg population and lend insight into the fraction of lbgs detected as a result of merger induced star formation .",
    "future high - resolution ground - based ifu data on existing instruments , such as osiris on keck , have the capability to resolve the velocity structure of lbg-2377 and hence its true nature .    j.c . is supported in part by a gary mccue postdoctoral fellowship through the center for cosmology at the university of california , irvine .",
