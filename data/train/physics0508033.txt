    "oscillations are ubiquitous in biological systems .",
    "examples range from circadian rhythms associated with external periodicities to autonomous bio - chemical  @xcite and mechano - chemical oscillators .",
    "voltage oscillations in systems of ion channels embedded in a cell membrane are one of the most prominent examples for a biochemical oscillator . at the heart of its explanation within the hodgkin - huxley model  @xcite",
    "there is a negative differential current - voltage relation for the ion channels .",
    "such biochemical oscillators are by now well studied @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been growing interest in mechano - chemical systems composed of visco - elastic biopolymer arrays and active molecular machines driven by the chemical cycle of atp hydrolysis ; these will be the focus of our contribution .",
    "we ask how the interplay between force - generation and energy - input by the molecular motors and the restoring forces and damping mechanisms provided by the biopolymer system may lead to oscillatory behavior .",
    "there are many examples of functional units in cellular systems whose main components are molecular machines and visco - elastic elements .",
    "the part list of _ auditory hair bundles _ contains stereocilia ( elastic rods composed of bundles of stiff biopolymers f - actin ) , myosin ( a force - generating molecular motor ) and mechanosensitive ion - channels .",
    "spontaneous oscillations in such systems are by now well documented experimentally @xcite and explained within simple theoretical models @xcite .",
    "this oscillatory behavior of hair bundles provides a mechanism for active amplification of acoustic signals @xcite .",
    "another example are _ eucaryotic cilia and flagella _ which are used by many small organisms to swim . here",
    "the main structural element are axonemes , which consist of a cylindrical arrangement of elastically linked microtubules ( another example for a stiff biopolymer ) and an assembly of dynein motors located between neighboring microtubules .",
    "forces generated by the dynein motors induce relative sliding between microtubules which in turn results into bending of the axonemes @xcite .",
    "oscillatory behavior in such systems is generic and intimately connected with a hopf bifurcation @xcite . _",
    "sarcomeres _ , the contractile units of muscle , are composed of two sets of protein filaments : myosin filaments ( containing myosin motors ) and actin filaments .",
    "the shortening of the sarcomere is achieved by the actin and myosin filaments sliding over one another . while the primary function of most types of muscle is to generate a unidirectional force , some muscle ( notably the asynchronous , also known as fibrillar or myogenic insect flight muscle ) are specialized on autonomous oscillatory contraction .",
    "the oscillation mechanism usually includes a number of regulatory proteins that constitute the delayed stretch - activation mechanism .",
    "however , oscillations were also observed in skeletal muscle fibrils , mostly under non - physiological conditions @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies show that even skeletal muscle myosin could produce oscillatory motion @xcite , which is normally not observable because the contributions of different sarcomeres cancel out .",
    "however , a sudden change in applied load can lead to synchronization of sarcomeres and the oscillations become observable for a certain period of time @xcite .",
    "assemblies of molecular motors and stiff biopolymers also play an essential role during cell division .",
    "the duplicated genome is segregated into two daughter cells through the action of the mitotic spindle .",
    "it consists of fibres ( microtubule bundles ) radiating from two poles and meeting at the equator in the middle .",
    "the spindle poles have been found to oscillate @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that these oscillations are again due to an interplay between force - generating and elastic elements @xcite .    here",
    "we will focus on a discussion of the generic features of oscillations in molecular motor assemblies to highlight the common physical mechanisms . for more system",
    "specific and detailed discussions we refer the reader to the literature .",
    "the defining elements of molecular motor assemblies are : ( i ) an external energy source driving the system towards a non - equilibrium steady state , ( ii ) viscoelastic elements providing restoring forces and damping mechanisms , ( iii ) possibly force - dependent biochemical reactions which allow for switching between different states of the molecular motor assembly .",
    "the particular interconnection between these components gives rise to the system response which may be controlled by the biochemical reaction rates .",
    "defined as such there are obvious analogies to system and control theory which is a well established discipline in engineering @xcite . in particular ,",
    "linear system analysis is a most fruitful concepts which we will also employ to characterize the system s dynamic response .",
    "the mechanisms for oscillations in chemochemical models discussed in the literature can be grouped into two distinct categories . in _ delayed force activation _",
    "systems an imposed displacement @xmath0 is transduced into a force @xmath1 with some delay time @xmath2 ( debye relaxator ) .",
    "as such the system would evolve towards a time - independent steady state .",
    "oscillatory response is achieved only after coupling the debye relaxator to other dynamic elements with either a negative stiffness or some inertial ( massive ) load .",
    "_ anomalous force - velocity relations _ are an alternative route towards oscillatory behavior .",
    "this means that an assembly of motors can move with two different velocities ( e.g. , one positive and one negative ) under the same load @xcite . if attached to an external spring , the motors will move forwards until the spring force exceeds a certain threshold , then they will switch to the other stable state and slide backwards , until another threshold is reached and so the cycle repeats @xcite .",
    "to assess the stability of an active mechanical system like an insect muscle attached to the wing or the dynein motor acting between two tubulin filaments in a flagellum , the response function can be defined the following way .",
    "we connect the active system to a mechanical actuator that keeps its length at the desired point of operation and at the same time imposes small oscillations with the amplitude @xmath3 around that point @xmath4 fur sufficiently small oscillations the system responds with a force that oscillates with the same frequency @xmath5 here @xmath6 denote an ensemble average over different realizations of the response of the stochastic system .",
    "note that the sign in the exponent of the fourier transform was chosen in the way that is most common in the literature on muscle , although it is opposite to the convention frequently used in physics .",
    "we define the force in the way that it is positive if the motor system is being pulled upon in the direction of positive @xmath0 . in the limit of small amplitude @xmath3 , the relation becomes linear @xmath7 with the frequency dependent response function or modulus @xmath8 . here",
    "the real part of @xmath9 corresponds to the elastic and the imaginary part to the dissipative response . for a spring with a spring constant",
    "@xmath10 the response function is @xmath11 and for a damping element ( `` dashpot '' ) @xmath12 .",
    "one may also encounter a situation where for a given force @xmath1 one is observing the displacement @xmath0 for various realizations of the system response , @xmath13 the two response functions become equivalent @xmath14 if the following two conditions are fulfilled .",
    "first , the system needs to be stable , so that the operational point is the same regardless whether the position or the force is imposed .",
    "second , the systems are large enough such that variance of the stochastic variable is small compared to its mean .",
    "the nyquist stability criterion is a convenient tool to analyze the stability of a dynamical system if the complex response function @xmath8 is known over the whole frequency range .",
    "it states that the system is dynamically unstable if the plot of @xmath15 vs. @xmath16 ( nyquist plot , sometimes also called cole - cole plot ) encircles the coordinate origin in clockwise direction .",
    "it is frequently used in engineering , especially for the stability analysis of closed feedback loops in electrical circuits @xcite .    to derive it we first note that the system is dynamically unstable if it starts oscillating with a growing amplitude in the absence of a force , @xmath17 .",
    "this is the case if there exists an eigenmode , i.e. , a complex solution of the equation @xmath18 with @xmath19 , since then the corresponding solution @xmath20 obviously diverges for @xmath21 .",
    "this means that @xmath8 has a zero and @xmath22 has a pole in the lower half - plane with @xmath23 .",
    "the nyquist criterion is based on the fact that @xmath8 is an analytical complex function and utilizes cauchy s theorem to relate the number of zeros in the negative imaginary @xmath24 half - plane to the contour of @xmath8 , evaluated for real values of @xmath24 .    according to cauchy s theorem",
    ", the change of phase along a closed contour in clockwise direction in the complex @xmath24 plane equals @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of encircled zeros of @xmath8 , @xmath27 the number of poles and @xmath28 and @xmath29 their multiplicities .",
    "for example , the function @xmath30 has a single zero ( @xmath31 ) with multiplicity 1 ( @xmath32 ) at @xmath33 .",
    "accordingly , it changes its phase by @xmath34 on a clockwise circle around the origin .",
    "the function @xmath35 , on the other hand , has a zero with multiplicity @xmath36 at @xmath33 and it changes its phase by @xmath37 on the same circle .",
    "we apply cauchy s theorem to a path that runs along the real @xmath24 axis from @xmath38 to @xmath39 and close it in the negative imaginary plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiplane]a .",
    "we further note that in a real system @xmath8 can have no poles in the negative imaginary half - plane , because they would imply an infinite force response to a finite displacement growing in time .",
    "therefore , any phase change along that path indicates a zero with @xmath19 , and therefore a dynamical instability .     in the complex @xmath24 plane",
    ". encircled zeros ( marked `` @xmath40 '' ) correspond to unstable eigenmodes .",
    "b ) @xmath9 in the complex plane , with @xmath24 as a parameter .",
    "the points denoted as a , b and c correspond to a negative , 0 and a positive value of @xmath24 .",
    "the curve shown has a typical shape measured on insect flight muscle @xcite.,width=604 ]    now we can look at the same path in the complex @xmath9 plane , i.e. , @xmath15 plotted against @xmath16 , where @xmath24 acts as a curve parameter .",
    "the strand along the real axis in the @xmath24 plane corresponds to the @xmath41 curve , with @xmath24 taking real values values from @xmath42 to @xmath43 . in case @xmath44 , we close the path in the positive real half - plane ( fig .  [ fig : chiplane]b ) , which corresponds to the closure in the @xmath45 half - plane .",
    "a change of phase of @xmath9 along the path in the @xmath24 plane by a multiple of @xmath34 directly represents the same number of origin encirclements in the @xmath9 plane .",
    "therefore , it follows from ( [ eq : cauchy ] ) that the complex @xmath8 curve encircles the coordinate origin @xmath46 times in clockwise direction .",
    "note that the curve is symmetric with respect to the real axis .",
    "this becomes evident from the following consideration . because @xmath47 is a real function , its fourier transformed has to fulfill the following symmetry relation : @xmath48 for real @xmath24 values , this means @xmath49 , and for each @xmath9 value its complex conjugate is part of the curve as well .",
    "an additional consequence of the nyquist criterion is that the origin can only be encircled in clockwise direction , because @xmath9 contains zeros but no poles in the relevant region .",
    "one type of models , often used to explain oscillations generated by molecular motors involves a delayed force activation mechanism .",
    "this means that when the system is displaced by the distance @xmath0 in one direction , it develops a restoring force @xmath1 , however not instantaneously , but according to a differential equation like : @xmath50 here @xmath2 represents the time constant with which the force reacts to a position change and @xmath51 an effective steady state stiffness of the active system .",
    "there are many different physical mechanisms that can produce a delayed force response ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanisms - delayed - feedback ] ) :    1 .",
    "stretch - activation of insect flight muscle : a number of regulatory proteins facilitate the activation of myosin motors following a mechanical stretch ( a relative displacement of thin filaments relative to thick ) @xcite . after the activation ,",
    "the development of force does not follow instantaneously , but with a certain time constant , typically with the attachment rate of motors .",
    "2 .   in a sarcomere",
    "a position change can bring myosin heads closer to the accessible actin sites @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been proposed for insect flight muscle @xcite , although experiments have later refuted it in many cases @xcite .",
    "3 .   the switching of bound myosin heads between two conformations with different detachment rates can lead to an effective stretch - dependent activation @xcite .",
    "4 .   the opening of a mechanically gated ion channel can cause the influx of calcium ions , which then promote channel reclosure .",
    "this is called the fast adaptation mechanism in auditory hair cells and can generate spontaneous hair bundle oscillations @xcite . if the hair cell is on the verge of spontaneous oscillations ( i.e. , close to a hopf bifurcation ) it has the best sensitivity , dynamic range and frequency selectivity @xcite . 5 .",
    "calcium ions , entering the ion channel , can reduce the force generated by adaptation motors of type myosin 1c @xcite , a mechanism known as slow adaptation in auditory hair cells @xcite . 6 .",
    "some models for flagellar dynein are based on a strain - controlled @xcite or curvature - controlled @xcite activation .",

    "hence the nyquist plot of @xmath64 can not encircle the coordinate origin and thereby satisfy the nyquist criterion for an instability .",
    "the stationary state of the debye relaxator simply is a time - independent displacement @xmath65 .",
    "note , that a dynamics with a one - dimensional phase space , i.e. first order differential equations of the form @xmath66 , is either monotonic or constant @xcite .",
    "only if the dynamic variable is on a circle or if the phase space has more than two dimensions oscillations emerge as possible solutions .",
    "one way to make the system unstable is to connect the active mechanism with an element that shifts the nyquist plot towards negative values on the real axis ; for an illustration of the type of connection see fig .",
    "[ fig : nyquist_sa ] . this can be trivially achieved through an element with a negative effective stiffness , or , as we will show below , through an inertial load .",
    "figure [ fig : nyquist_sa ] shows the response function of the delayed activation system ( [ eq : chi_df ] ) , combined with different elements .",
    "the first is an element consisting of a spring ( constant @xmath67 ) and a dashpot ( damping coefficient @xmath68 ) in series .",
    "their combined response function reads @xmath69 a second element we connect to the motor assembly is an element with negative effective elasticity , @xmath70 the third element is a damped inertial oscillator ( a spring connected to a mass , with an additional damping element connecting both to a fixed point ) .",
    "the response function of such an element reads @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "negative stiffness can be generated by the gating compliance of ion channels @xcite or by motors switching between two states @xcite .",
    "inertial load is the likely mechanism of ensuring an instability in insect flight muscle @xcite .",
    "also in many types of hair cells , no negative stiffness has been observed , but as the hair bundle is often attached to the tectorial membrane , inertial load could play an important role as well @xcite .",
    "a class of models that were frequently discussed in relation to dynamical instabilities in systems of molecular motors is based on an anomalous force - velocity relation , meaning that a group of coupled motors produces a force that displays a region with negative slope as a function of velocity .",
    "models for dynein @xcite , myosin @xcite , propulsion by actin polymerization @xcite , mitotic spindle oscillations @xcite as well as generic motors @xcite were based on this mechanism .",
    "a common feature of such models is translational invariance , meaning that the force @xmath74 does not depend on the position @xmath0 , but only on the velocity @xmath75 and the history thereof .",
    "the translational invariance can be achieved even on periodic tracks ( like actin filaments ) if the motors ( myosin heads ) are arranged incommensurate to the track periodicity @xcite .",
    "an instructive example of a system displaying an anomalous force - velocity relation is a two - state cross - bridge model for motors like myosin . in this model",
    ", motors can attach to actin in a forward - leaning position with rate @xmath76 , then quickly undergo a conformational change , which makes them strained .",
    "when the filaments moves , this strain changes with time ( for forward - running motors , it decreases ) , and when the motor eventually detaches with a strain - dependent rate @xmath77 the cycle can repeat .",
    "each motor generates a force @xmath78 , proportional to its strain @xmath79 .",
    "a full description of this system requires master equations for the probability of a motor for being in the detached state ( @xmath80 ) and for the probability density of a motor for being in the attached state with strain @xmath79 ( @xmath81 ) . @xmath82",
    "both probabilities are not independent but normalized such that @xmath83 gives the total number of motors .",
    "@xmath84 , normalized as @xmath85 is the distribution of strains on newly attached motors , with an expectation value @xmath86 .",
    "a general analytical solution for the stationary state of these equations is given in @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the key physical features of this model we neglect the strain - dependence of the attachment probability and assume that all attached motors have the same strain @xmath87 , @xmath88 then the number of attached motors @xmath89 is related to the number of detached motors by @xmath90 . upon inserting these relations into eqs.[eq : master],b , multiplying eq.[eq : master ] with @xmath79 and integrating over all values of @xmath79 one obtains a simplified set of dynamic equations for @xmath87 and @xmath91 : @xmath92 \\frac{n - n}{n } r_{\\rm a } -v\\\\    \\dot n & = & [ n - n ] r_{\\rm a }   -n r_{\\rm d}(y)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the external force on the system , which equals the total force produced by the motors , is given as @xmath93 where @xmath10 denotes the spring constant of each motor .",

    ", they always have a stable stationary solution .",
    "however , if we take the system consisting of the group of motors , coupled to an external spring with a spring constant @xmath67 , so that the force equilibrium states @xmath94 , we obtain a new system of two nonlinear equations for two independent variables ( e.g. , @xmath0 and @xmath95 ) .",
