    "open clusters ( ocs ) are believed to be coeval groups of stars born from the same proto - cluster cloud which may have been part of a larger star - forming region in the milky way .",
    "ages of clusters range from very young where stars are still forming to nearly 10 gyr ( dias et al .",
    "since all stars in most ocs are at the same distance and have the same chemical composition , basic stellar parameters like age , distance , and metallicity can be determined more accurately than for field stars .",
    "thus , ocs provide an excellent opportunity to map the structure , kinematics , and chemistry of the galactic disk with respect to galactic coordinates and time .",
    "the presence of chemical homogeneity among cluster members has been shown by the study of ocs , see , for example , spectroscopic analyses of the hyades ( paulson et al .",
    "2003 ; de silva et al . 2006 ) and collinder 261 ( carretta et al . 2005 ; de silva et al .",
    "this observed homogeneity signifies that the proto - cloud is well mixed , and hence , the abundance pattern of a cluster bears the signature of chemical evolution of the natal cloud .",
    "chemical evolution of the milky way has , of course , been well studied using field stars .",
    "a large fraction of field stars are from disrupted ocs ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "the youngest ocs may be intact . the oldest ocs may be totally disrupted .",
    "thus , the field stars do not fully sample the age distribution of ocs and , in particular , the youngest stellar generations are under - represented by field stars .    in this paper , we report abundance analyses from high - resolution spectra of red giants in four ocs : ngc 752 , ngc 1817 , ngc 2360 , and ngc 2506 .",
    "these analyses are the first for these ocs to report elemental abundances for elements from na to eu .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe the data selection , observations and data reduction and section 3 is devoted to the abundance analysis . in section 4",
    "we present our results and compare them with the abundances derived from samples of field thin and thick disk stars ( i.e. dwarfs and giants ) .",
    "finally , in section 5 we give the conclusions ."
