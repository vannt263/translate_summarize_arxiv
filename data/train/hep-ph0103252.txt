    "( [ eq : evol ] ) is the evolution operator in flavor basis for constant matter density . to handle the case of varying matter density ,",
    "let us divide the distance @xmath49 from the source to the detector into @xmath75 equidistant parts and put the index @xmath98 on the eigenvalues @xmath99 , where @xmath28 denote the three mass eigenstates .",

    "the evolution operator in mass basis from @xmath107 to @xmath49 can then be written as the ordered product @xmath108 note that the order of the @xmath109 s are important , since these operators do not in general commute .    when @xmath75 is large , each step is small and the exponent in the evolution operator @xmath110 is small .",

    "however , here we will at first be satisfied with the lowest order result , which we call the _ semi - classical approximation_. in this approximation , we retain only the terms proportional to @xmath117 , and thus , neglect the noncommutativity of the @xmath115 s for different @xmath98 s .",
    "we can thus write @xmath118 in the limit @xmath119 , this gives the integral formula @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the traceless part of the hamiltonian corresponding to the electron density at position @xmath116 between @xmath107 and @xmath49 and @xmath122 is the phase factor coming from the trace .",
    "for further discussion it is often convenient to retain the original form of the hamiltonian and to use @xmath123 rather than @xmath50 .",

    "thus , for any @xmath49 we can use the spectral decomposition theorem and we find that @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the @xmath138th eigenvalue of @xmath139 ( or @xmath140 ) and @xmath141 \\label{proj1}\\ ] ] is the projection operator .",
    "everything here is of course @xmath49-dependent , since the operator is @xmath49-dependent and therefore also the eigenvalues .",
    "the phase factor is @xmath142 .    in the case of a linear matter density of the form @xmath143",
    ", we obtain @xmath144 .",
    "similarly , in the case of a step function like matter density , relevant to the matter distribution of the earth , we have @xmath145 which leads to @xmath146 finally , in the case of an exponentially decreasing matter density @xmath147 , where @xmath133 and @xmath148 are parameters relevant to the matter distribution of the sun , we obtain @xmath149    we can see here that in the semi - classical approximation the influence of the density @xmath150 decays as @xmath151 with distance @xmath49 from the matter .",
    "the evolution should therefore be continued with the vacuum evolution operator as soon as the neutrinos leave the matter region .",
    "let us consider the semi - classical ( s.c . )",
    "evolution operator further . it can be written as @xmath152 where @xmath153 here @xmath154 .",
    "now , the equation of motion for the full evolution operator @xmath155 is @xmath156 this can be integrated to give the equation @xmath157 upon differentiating the semi - classical evolution operator above , we see that , although @xmath158 we can equate @xmath159 with @xmath160 only when the commutator @xmath161 $ ] can be neglected .",

    "this is in general true only for constant matter densities , @xmath179 .",
    "when @xmath180 is large , the contribution of the commutator can not be neglected .",

    "i.e. _ , they consist of a product of 100 evolutions with different constant matter densities for each evolution step , whereas the semi - classical approximation method result was obtained with just one single evolution with the average matter density of the earth s matter density profile @xmath230 ( @xmath231 , which is also the reason why the semi - classical approximation curve only has got one resonance peak at @xmath232 .",
    "this peak of course lies inbetween the both resonance peaks ( ideally at @xmath233 and @xmath234 ) of the exact numerical evolution calculation , since @xmath235 .",
