    "the ionization structure of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at high redshift has been the focus of much recent attention . on the basis of measurements of the mean transmitted flux in spectra of the highest known redshift quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , it has been suggested that the reionization of the igm had just completed at @xmath7 ( becker 2001 ) . by contrast , measurements of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) suggest the igm was reionized earlier , at @xmath8 ( @xmath9 lower limit ) ( kogut 2003 ) .",
    "the most obvious candidate sources of reionization are stars and qsos .",
    "an assessment based on the results of the hubble ultra - deep field ( udf ) and the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) by bunker ( 2004 ) suggests that the galaxies identified at @xmath10 are too few to account for the reionization of the igm by @xmath11 . on the other hand , yan & windhorst ( 2004 ) and stiavelli , fall & panagia ( 2004 ) dissent from this view , arguing that , with plausible assumptions , these sources are adequate .",
    "yan & windhorst further argue that galaxies appear to be the only sources of reionization . they claim qsos contribute negligibly to the overall ionizing photon budget , falling short of the required numbers by more than two orders of magnitude",
    "meiksin & white ( 2004 ) argue instead for a much smaller discrepancy for the quasars .",
    "the range of views in the literature highlights the sensitivity of conclusions regarding reionization to prevailing uncertainties , in particular the luminosity function of the sources , their nature ( especially their emergent uv spectra ) , and the structure of the igm .",
    "a question distinct from the sources responsible for reionization is the nature of the sources which dominate the uv photoionizing background at @xmath0 , when the igm is clearly ionized .",
    "the populations need not be the same , as the ionizing contribution from the sources responsible for reionizing the igm may decline with time , while other sources begin to dominate the uv background of the post - reionization universe .",
    "for instance , the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies at high redshifts is currently unclear , and could in principle be sufficiently high to enable galaxies to reionize the igm . steidel ( 2001 ) report a detection of uv ionizing photons from the the brightest lyman break galaxies in a sample at @xmath12 , suggesting an escape fraction of about 10% , although this difficult measurement has not yet received independent confirmation .",
    "attempts to quantify the mean escape fraction have generally resulted only in upper limits .",
    "for instance , fernandez - soto , lanzetta & chen ( 2002 ) constrain the mean escape fraction for galaxies in the range @xmath13 to less that 4% , which may be too small for galaxies to maintain the ionization of the igm . applying an escape fraction of @xmath14% to the full range of galaxy luminosities ,",
    "steidel obtain a value for the global emissivity of ionizing radiation that is inconsistent with the emissivity required by numerical simulations of the igm to reproduce the measured values of the mean transmitted flux at @xmath12 .",
    "the high emissivity obtained by steidel would result in a much higher transmitted flux through the igm than measured , unless the sources were very short - lived ( eg , bursting at just @xmath12 ) ( meiksin & white 2003 ) .",
    "this suggests that the escape fraction found by steidel may be anomalously high . while an escape fraction of @xmath15% may be just sufficient for galaxies to maintain the ionization of the igm at @xmath12 , it is unclear whether this fraction is sufficient for galaxies to meet the requirements for reionizing the igm ( see stiavalli ) .",
    "constraints on the epoch of reionization and on the level of ionization in the post - reionization igm have usually been treated as separate issues . in this paper",
    ", it is shown that the two are closely related . any model that meets the requirements for the reionization epoch implies a level of ionization of the igm just after reionization is complete",
    "this level must be consistent with constraints imposed by measurements of the mean transmitted flux through the igm .",
    "in particular , if the high optical depth measurements at @xmath10 designate the tail end of the reionization epoch , then the rate of uv ionizing photon production by the sources must gracefully exit the reionization epoch at the level required to match the measured optical depth measurements at @xmath16 .",
    "a second purpose of this paper is to provide a statistical assessment of the contribution of qsos to the photoionizing background at @xmath17 , and to the overall budget of ionizing photons at @xmath10 , using the current best estimates of the faint ( hunt 2004 ) and bright ( fan 2001 , 2004 ) ends of the qso luminosity - redshift distribution .",
    "estimates of the uv background based on qso counts are not very well constrained at high redshifts ( @xmath17 ) due to the low sampling of the luminosity - redshift plane by existing surveys .",
    "the uncertainty is sufficiently large to allow for a substantial contribution to the uv metagalactic background from qsos at high redshifts ( meiksin & white 2004 ) .",
    "the epoch of reionization by sources of number density @xmath18 may be characterised by the time at which the porosity @xmath19 exceeds unity , where @xmath20 is the average volume of the universe ionized per source . at earlier stages ,",
    "the filling factor of the remaining neutral gas is @xmath21 . for any given evolutionary scenario of the sources ,",
    "the porosity is determined by the total rate of production @xmath22 of ionising photons per unit volume , which in turn scales like the total emissivity of the sources . on the other hand , for a uniform medium , the neutral fraction , and hence the optical depth @xmath23 , of",
    "the igm scales inversely with the total source emissivity . as a consequence",
    ", the product of the two will reflect only the evolution and spectral shape of the sources ( and the properties of the igm ) , but be independent of their actual numbers . for any given source history and spectral shape ,",
    "the optical depth just following the epoch of reionization is thus well - specified and must be consistent with measured values . turning this argument around , if the evolution of the emissivity and attenuation length are known , or reasonable guesses made based on observations or numerical simulations , then measurements of the optical depth may be used to provide a direct estimate of the porosity of the igm , and hence of the epoch of reionization .    in reality , the igm is not uniform , but clumped into the forest , so that the relation between the porosity and the measured mean optical depth is indirect .",
    "( here , the mean optical depth is defined as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the mean transmitted flux from a background source . )",
    "it is necessary to appeal to models of structure formation to establish the relation . within the context of the models ,",
    "the intimate relation between the porosity and mean transmitted flux persists . setting the source emissivity at a level to reionize the igm at a given epoch fixes the post - reionization photoionization rate of the igm , and so determines the mean transmitted flux just after reionization is completed ( for any given cosmological model ) .",
    "any reionization model must yield predictions consistent with these measured values .",
    "for instance , if the predicted photoionization rate were too high , the predicted mean transmitted flux levels would exceed those measured .",
    "constraints on the reionization epoch and the post - reionization transmitted flux values must be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "the results of a @xmath26cdm simulation run to investigate effects of radiative transfer on the forest ( meiksin & white 2004 ) are used to quantify the emissivity required to maintain the ionization of the igm over the redshift range @xmath2 at a level consistent with current measurements of the mean transmitted flux .",
    "the simulation was run using a pure particle mesh ( pm ) dark matter code , and it was assumed the gas and dark matter have the same spatial distribution , which is found to give an adequate description of the structure of the igm ( meiksin & white 2001 , 2003 ) . the parameters used for the simulation are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30@xmath31 , @xmath32 and slope of the primordial density perturbation power spectrum @xmath33 .",
    "these values will be used throughout .",
    "the model is consistent with existing large - scale structure , forest flux distribution , cluster abundance and _ wmap _ constraints ( meiksin & white 2004 ) . the simulation was run using @xmath34 particles and a @xmath35 force mesh , in a cubic box with ( comoving ) side length @xmath36mpc , adequate for obtaining converged estimates of the pixel flux distribution , the photon attenuation length and the required mean emissivity at the lyman edge ( meiksin & white 2003 , 2004 ) . a description of the parallel pm code is given in meiksin & white ( 2003 ) .",

    "these data were based on @xmath26cdm model requirements to match the mean transmitted flux measurements from a variety of sources ( see meiksin & white 2004 , appendix b ) .",
    "it is emphasized that the emissivity and attenuation length are solved for self - consistently in the model .",
    "simulation - based estimates of the required emissivity in the literature usually rely on an assumed attenuation length ( or , equivalenty , effective optical depth at the lyman edge ) based on statistical representations of the measured forest absorber properties ( like column density and doppler parameter ) .",
    "uncertainties in the measured distributions , however , produce uncertainties in the derived attenuation length as large as a factor of 23 ( meiksin & madau 1993 , meiksin & white 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "this uncertainty translates directly into a comparable uncertainty in the required source emissivity .",
    "for this reason , it is crucial that the inferred emissivity from a simulation be consistent with the attenuation length that the same simulation predicts .",

    "<S> constraints on the ionization structure of the intergalactic medium are derived as directly imposed by observations in conjunction with the results of numerical simulations for structure formation . under the assumption that the population of sources dominating the uv ionizing background at @xmath0 is the same population which reionized the igm , it is shown that consistency with measurements of the mean transmitted flux at high redshifts requires the epoch of hydrogen reionization of the igm to have occurred at a redshift @xmath1 , _ independent of the space density of the sources_. the upper limit on the reionization redshift depends only on the _ shape _ of the uv spectra of the sources . </S>",
    "<S> consistency with constraints on the reionization epoch from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ requires the sources of photoionization to have had hard spectra , such as qsos or population iii stars . </S>",
    "<S> the only way to escape these conclusions is either :  1 .  </S>",
    "<S> the sources which dominate the photoionization background at @xmath0 are the remnants of a population that was a much more prodigious source of ionizing photons at earlier times , or 2 .  </S>",
    "<S> the sources responsible for the photoionization of the igm are an unknown population that contributes negligibly to the ionization of the igm at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the qso luminosity function over the range @xmath2 is estimated from recent qso counts , and the fraction of ionizing photons arising in qsos is evaluated under the assumptions of either pure luminosity evolution or pure density evolution . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that qsos dominate the uv ionizing background for @xmath3 , but that it is unlikely that more than one half to one third of the ionizing background radiation originates in qsos in the redshift range @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> qsos acting alone could not have reionized the hydrogen in the igm prior to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> if the qsos had hard spectra , however , they may have reionized the helium in the igm as early as @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility that the igm was reionized by low luminosity agn is discussed .    </S>",
