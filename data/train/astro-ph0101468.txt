    "early - type galaxies ( elliptical and s0 galaxies ) constitute @xmath12% of the galaxy population in the central regions of nearby rich clusters ( dressler 1980 ) , and studies of nearby and distant clusters have provided strong constraints on their evolution and formation .",
    "the cluster observations have been used to constrain the stellar ages of early - type galaxies . on one hand , there is very good evidence that early - type galaxies form a very homogeneous , slowly evolving population : the scatter in their colors is small , both at low redshift ( e.g. , bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ) , and at high redshift ( ellis et al .",
    "1997 ; stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 ) , the scatter in their mass - to - light ratios is equally small ( e.g. , lucey et al .",
    "1991 , pahre , djorgovski , & de carvalho 1998 , kelson et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the evolution of their mass - to - light ratios is slow ( van dokkum & franx 1996 , kelson et al .",
    "1997 , bender et al .  1998 ,",
    "van dokkum et al .",
    "these results indicate a very high redshift of formation for the stars in early - type galaxies . as an example , van dokkum et al ( 1998a ) found from the evolution of the fundamental plane relation to @xmath13 that the stars in massive early - type galaxies must have formed at @xmath14 for @xmath15 , @xmath7 , and a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf .",
    "furthermore the low scatter in colors and @xmath3 ratios implies that the scatter in ages at any redshift is very small ( e.g. , ellis et al .",
    "1997 , stanford et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "on the other hand , evidence is accumulating that many early - type galaxies in clusters were relatively recently transformed from star forming galaxies .",
    "dressler et al .  ( 1997 ) report a high fraction of spiral galaxies in clusters at @xmath16 .",
    "these galaxies are nearly absent in nearby rich clusters ( dressler 1980 ) , and hence must have transformed into early - type galaxies between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "other studies ( e.g. , couch et al .  1998 , van dokkum et al .",
    "2000 ) have confirmed this trend , and extended it to @xmath19 .",
    "dressler et al.(1997 ) found that the increased fraction of spiral galaxies at high redshift was accompanied by a low fraction of s0 galaxies , and concluded that the @xmath20 spiral galaxies transformed into s0 galaxies .",
    "other studies have found evidence for merging and interactions in high redshift clusters ( lavery & henry 1988 ; lavery , pierce , & mcclure 1992 ; dressler et al .",
    "1994 ; couch et al .  1998 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "these transformations may provide a way to form young elliptical galaxies in the clusters at late times .",
    "the morphological evidence for recent and rapid evolution in the cluster galaxy population is supported by photometric and spectroscopic studies , which have found a significant increase of the number fractions of star forming and post star burst galaxies from @xmath18 to @xmath21 ( e.g. , butcher & oemler 1978 , 1984 , dressler & gunn 1983 , couch & sharples 1987 , postman , lubin , & oke 1998 , poggianti et al .  1999 , van dokkum et al 2000 ) .",
    "hence the evidence appears secure that many early - type galaxies in clusters were transformed from star forming galaxies at fairly recent times .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to produce models which can bring these apparently different lines of evidence regarding the ages into agreement .",
    "specifically , we analyse the effects of late morphological transformations as found by dressler et al . , and others , on the observed evolution of colors and luminosities with redshift .",
    "we show that the effect of `` progenitor bias '' ( franx & van dokkum 1996 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "2000 ) can be very significant : if early - type galaxies were transformed from other galaxy types at late times , the youngest progenitors of present - day early - type galaxies drop out of the sample of early - type galaxies at high redshift .",
    "hence the samples of galaxies at low and high redshift are not the same , and in particular , the high redshift samples might be biased towards the oldest progenitors of present - day early - type galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to quantify the effects of progenitor bias , and to estimate the corrections which are required for models which ignore morphological evolution .",
    "to that end , we construct relatively simple models for the history of star formation and morphological type of cluster early - type galaxies .",
    "we show that the observed slow luminosity evolution and low scatter in the color - magnitude relation and the fundamental plane are natural consequences of recent and ongoing assembly of early - type galaxies .",
    "we correct the observed evolution for the progenitor bias , and derive the corrected mean age of the stars in early - type galaxies .",
    "our models are extensions of the earlier work by van dokkum et al ( 1998b ) , bower et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and shioya & bekki ( 1998 ) .",
    "these authors considered complex star formation histories of cluster galaxies , but did not investigate the effects of morphological transformations on the observed properties of early - type galaxies at high redshift . the progenitor bias is implicitly included in the very detailed semi - analytical models by , for example , kauffman & charlot ( 1998 ) and baugh , cole , & frenk ( 1996 ) . in these complex models",
    "it is difficult to isolate and quantify specific effects , such as the progenitor bias .",
    "the main contribution of our work is that we use simple analytic models with only three free parameters , which allows us to provide explicit estimates for the effects of morphological evolution on the observed colors and luminosities of early - type galaxies .",
    "we construct simple models for the evolution of early - type galaxies , which parameterize both their star formation history and morphological evolution .",
    "our models allow the full history to be quantified by three parameters .",
    "they are not based on a full physical description of the formation and evolution of galaxies as derived by , e.g. , kauffmann , white , & guiderdoni ( 1993 ) and baugh et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "we assume that early - type galaxies have similar histories of star formation and morphology .",
    "the history of each individual galaxy can be described by three parameters : the time when star formation starts , the time when star formation stops , and the variation of star formation between the start and end .",
    "the star formation is allowed to increase or decrease with time .",
    "it is assumed that the galaxy is classified as an early - type galaxy some time after the cessation of starformation .",
    "we assume that the galaxies do not stop their star formation at the same time , but rather have a distribution of cessation times .",
    "this description is fairly generic for many detailed theories of galaxy formation .",
    "we do not define the processes driving the morphological transformation and the cessation of star formation .",
    "various processes have been invoked , including gas stripping of spiral galaxies ( e.g. , gunn & gott 1972 , tytler & vidal 1978 , abadi , moore , & bower 1999 , kodama & smail 2000 ) , tidal interactions ( e.g. , fried 1988 , moore et al .",
    "1996 ) , and mergers ( e.g. , lavery et al .",
    "1992 , van dokkum et al.1999 ) .",
    "it does not matter in our analysis what process causes the cessation of star formation , and we allow for bursts of star formation to accompany this event .    the transition phase between star forming galaxy and early - type galaxy is assumed to last for a significant time . immediately after the cessation of star formation galaxies are likely to show tidal features ( in case of an interaction or merger ) , or weak spiral arms .",
    "the morphologies of `` e+a '' or post star burst galaxies seem to be consistent with this scenario .",
    "they generally are classified as early - type spirals or tidally distorted systems ( poggianti et al.1999 ; fabricant et al .",
    "2000 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "it is not well known how long it takes before these structures fade or disperse ; we assume that early - type galaxies are first classified as such @xmath22gyr after star formation in their progenitors ceased .    in the current section",
    "we do not specify whether the models apply to elliptical galaxies , s0 galaxies , or both .",
    "observationally , the early - type galaxy fraction is more robust than the relative numbers of elliptical galaxies and s0 galaxies ( e.g. , fabricant , franx , & van dokkum 2000 , van dokkum et al .",
    "if different histories apply to the two classes of galaxies , two separate models will be needed for each sub - class .",
    "we explore such models in section 5 .",
    "the generic effects of late morphological transitions are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ modeltracks.plot ] . in panel",
    "( a ) , the evolution of the mass - to - light ratio is shown for a population of galaxies with a small range in age , without any late morphological transitions . as can be seen , galaxies with young stellar populations evolve more rapidly than galaxies with old stellar populations , and hence the spread in @xmath3 ratios increases with redshift ( panel b ) .",
    "the mean evolution is faster than that of a single age population formed at @xmath23 , which is indicated by the dashed line in ( b ) .",
    "this type of modelling has been used extensively to constrain the ages of early - type galaxies in clusters : if there are no morphological transitions , the evolution of the mean color or luminosity constrains the mean age of early - type galaxies , and the scatter constrains the spread in ages ( e.g. , bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 , ellis et al .",
    "1997 , van dokkum et al .",
    "1998(a , b ) , bower et al .",
    "1998 , stanford et al .",
    "1998 , ferreras & silk 2000 ) .    in panel ( c )",
    ", a model is shown in which galaxies are transformed into early - type galaxies at a constant rate .",
    "the broken lines indicate galaxies before they are recognized as early - type galaxies .",
    "it can easily be seen that the sample of early - type galaxies at high redshift is a small subsample of all galaxies which are classified as early - type galaxies at @xmath18 .",
    "the two samples are therefore not directly comparable , and erroneous results are derived if morphological evolution is ignored . as a result ,",
    "the evolution in the mean @xmath3 ratio of the early - type galaxies is very slow ( panel d ) .",
    "the slope of the @xmath3 ",
    "@xmath24 relation is comparable to the slope for a single stellar population which formed at @xmath25 ( indicated by the dashed line ) , even though the mean formation redshift of the stars in all early - type galaxies at @xmath18 is low at @xmath26 .",
    "even more remarkable is the fact that the scatter in @xmath3 ratios is virtually constant .",
    "these effects are caused by the fact that the youngest galaxies continuously drop out of the sample going to higher redshifts . in the subsections below",
    "we specify a broader range of models , and explore the consequences .",
    "the full models are quantified by three parameters : @xmath27 , the time when star formation starts , @xmath28 , the time scale which characterizes the distribution of times when star formation stops , and @xmath29 , which describes the star formation rate between the start and end of star formation .",
    "the last two parameters are defined in the following way .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 determines the probability distribution of @xmath30 , the time when star formation stops for an individual galaxy : @xmath31 we show later that this expression can provide a satisfactory fit to the data . if @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the present age of the universe , star formation in the progenitors terminated at very high redshift . at the other extreme",
    ", @xmath34 corresponds to a constant transformation rate . for each individual galaxy ,",
    "the morphological transformation to early - type galaxy occurs at @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36 gyr after truncation of star formation .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 characterizes the variation of the star formation rate .",
    "the star formation history of the galaxies can include bursts , and increasing or decreasing continuous formation rates as a function of time .",
    "after star formation ceases , the luminosity and color evolution of such a complex population is well approximated by a single age population of stars with the same luminosity weighted mean age ( e.g. , van dokkum et al .",
    "1998b ) .",
    "hence for each galaxy we approximate the evolution of the complex population by that of a single age population formed at @xmath37 , with @xmath38 for @xmath39 , the stellar population is dominated by a burst at the end of the star formation history , and for @xmath40 the population is dominated by a burst at the start of the star formation history . if the star formation rate is approximately constant from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , then @xmath43 .",
    "we tested the accuracy of our approach by calculating the luminosity and color evolution of galaxies with complex star formation histories ( e.g. , an exponentially declining star formation rate followed by a star burst ) , and comparing the results to predictions from single burst models with the same values of @xmath44 .",
    "after transformation to early - type galaxy ( i.e. , @xmath45gyr after star formation has ceased ) our approximation of luminosity and color evolution is accurate to a few percent .",
    "three possible star formation histories of early - type galaxies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fstar.plot ] .",
    "the model with @xmath46 has a star burst at the end of its star formation history , and may be appropriate for spiral galaxies falling into clusters , or mergers .",
    "although these histories are quite complex , @xmath47gyr after star formation has ceased their evolution is similar to that of single age stellar populations formed at @xmath48 .",
    "our parameterization allows straightforward computation of luminosities and colors of galaxies , because the luminosity evolution of a single age stellar population can be approximated by a power law ( e.g. , tinsley 1980 , worthey 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , to good approximation , @xmath49 the coefficient @xmath50 depends on the passband , the imf , and the metallicity . in this paper",
    "we will limit the discussion to rest frame @xmath51 band luminosities , and rest frame @xmath52 colors .",
    "our results can easily be expressed in other ( rest frame ) bands .",
    "the worthey ( 1994 ) models give @xmath53 and @xmath54 for solar metallicity and a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf .",
    "the color evolution can be approximated by @xmath55 expressed in magnitudes , color and luminosity evolution are related through @xmath56 in these models . the evolution of the mean color and scatter in the color will therefore be similar to the scaled evolution of the mean @xmath3 ratio and its scatter .    in the following , we use monte - carlo simulations to calculate model predictions for given values of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath27 .",
    "this approach has the advantage that the mean and scatter in colors and luminosities at a given time can be computed using the same methods as for the observations . in the simulations ,",
    "all galaxies start out as star forming objects at @xmath41 .",
    "each galaxy is assigned a value for @xmath30 , the time when star formation ceases .",
    "the distribution of @xmath30 is given by eq .",
    "[ first.eq ] , with boundary condition @xmath57 , with @xmath33 the present age of the universe . at each timestep @xmath58 ,",
    "objects which satisfy the condition @xmath59 are selected as early - type galaxies . using eq.[levo.eq ] and [ colevo.eq ] these galaxies",
    "are assigned a luminosity and a color .",
    "the central value and the spread of the color and luminosity distribution at time @xmath58 are calculated with the biweight statistic ( beers , flynn , & gebhardt 1990 ) .",
    "this statistic was also used by stanford et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and van dokkum et al.(1998b , 2000 ) to calculate the scatter in the high redshift color - magnitude relation .",
    "we note that the evolution of the mean @xmath3 ratio and colors of early - type galaxies can also be evaluated analytically . in appendix",
    "a we give approximate expressions which can be used for most applications .",
    "we calculate the predicted evolution of the @xmath3 ratio and its scatter for several models . to demonstrate the effects of progenitor bias we consider two classes of models , one with mild morphological evolution ( @xmath60 ) and one with strong morphological evolution ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "figure [ modeldata.plot ] shows the results .    in models with @xmath60",
    "morphological evolution is not very important to @xmath21 , and @xmath62% of present - day early - type galaxies were already in place at that redshift . in models with @xmath61 , on the other hand ,",
    "only @xmath63% of early - type galaxies were in place at @xmath21 .",
    "in all panels of fig .",
    "[ modeldata.plot ] broken lines show the class of models with mild morphological evolution , and solid lines show models with strong morphological evolution .",
    "panels ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) show the effect of changing the star formation history , while keeping the time of onset of star formation fixed at @xmath64 .",
    "the results for the evolution of the mean @xmath3 ratio are shown in panel ( a ) .",
    "quite remarkably , nearly all model predictions lie very close to the line for old populations which formed at the start of the universe ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "we find little dependence on the tranformation time scale @xmath28 or on @xmath44 , which characterizes the star formation history .",
    "this result illustrates the dramatic effects of the progenitor bias , as the mean stellar age of the galaxies at @xmath18 can be as low as half the age of the universe ( for @xmath66 ) , and yet the apparent evolution follows the relation for very old populations formed at infinite redshift .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is that the formation models are almost scale free . in models with a constant transformation rate , at any time the youngest half of the galaxies have been added to the sample in the last half of the age of the universe at that time . as a result ,",
    "the mean stellar age of the galaxies is an almost constant fraction of the age of the universe , independent of the star formation histories of individual galaxies , and the mean mass - to - light ratios and colors will evolve as if the stars formed at very high redshift . in the appendix",
    "we demonstrate this effect analytically .",
    "the absolute colors and mass - to - light ratios at @xmath18 will be different for these models , but these are notoriously difficult to interpret uniquely ( e.g. , worthey 1994 , faber et al .  1999 ) .",
    "fortunately , the scatter in @xmath3 ratios and colors is much more sensitive to the transformation timescale and star formation histories .",
    "we show the scatter in @xmath3 ratios in panel ( b ) . for a given morphological transformation rate",
    "the variation in the average scatter is large , because it is a strong function of the star formation history of galaxies . as we will see later",
    ", this implies that observations of the scatter put important constraints on the models .",
    "for galaxies with later star formation , @xmath44 increases , and the scatter increases almost linearly with @xmath44 . for the limiting case of a constant transformation rate ( @xmath34 ) , we find that the scatter is well approximated by @xmath67 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the scatter is not strongly dependent on redshift because of the scale - free nature of the models . in such scale - free models ,",
    "the relative age differences between early - type galaxies at any epoch is fairly constant .",
    "the scatter is proportional to the age differences between galaxies relative to the mean age ( e.g. , van dokkum et al .",
    "as galaxies are continuously added to the sample , the range in ages increases at the same rate as the mean age ; hence the spread in ages relative to the mean age remains constant . in the appendix",
    "this effect is demonstrated analytically . only in models with mild morphological evolution to @xmath21",
    "( indicated by the broken lines in fig .",
    "[ modeldata.plot ] ) we find an increase of the scatter with redshift . in these models",
    "the scatter is very low at @xmath18 , and at @xmath68 reaches values similar to those in models with strong morphological evolution .",
    "the progenitor bias of the models is shown in panel ( c ) .",
    "we define the progenitor bias at given redshift as the difference between the @xmath3 ratio of early - type galaxies and the @xmath3 ratio of all progenitors of present - day early - type galaxies .",
    "this is the `` error '' in the observed @xmath3 ratio that is caused by the late addition of early - type galaxies to the sample .",
    "as the figure shows , the bias increases with increasing tranformation time scale @xmath28 , and increasing @xmath44 .",
    "both parameters also cause the scatter to increase . for models with strong morphological evolution",
    "the progenitor bias can be approximated by @xmath69 this approximation is accurate to @xmath70% for @xmath71 .",
    "this result suggests that the progenitor bias can be estimated on the basis of the observed transformation rate , and the observed scatter .",
    "the star formation history is the individual galaxies , as parametrized by @xmath44 , is not needed to estimate the effect .",
    "this is a very useful result , as it is difficult to constrain the value of @xmath44 directly from the observed colors and luminosities .",
    "panels ( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) show the effect of changing the time of onset of star formation @xmath27 , while keeping the star formation history constant at @xmath72 ( i.e. , approximately constant star formation from @xmath27 to @xmath30 ) .",
    "the evolution of the mean @xmath3 ratio for the various models is shown in panel ( f ) .",
    "the evolution is very sensitive to the time of onset of star formation : there is an almost linear relation between the time when star formation commences and the rate of @xmath3 evolution .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is that the mean age of the stellar population in all galaxies is lower for higher values of @xmath27 . as will be shown in sect .",

    "the scatter and the progenitor bias are shown in panels ( e ) and ( f ) .",

    "[ es0.sec ] we explore models in which both classes are modeled separately .",
    "the evolution of the early - type galaxy fraction is possibly influenced by the inclusion of low mass galaxies undergoing star bursts .",
    "since the samples are magnitude selected , the presence of such galaxies at high redshift would decrease the fraction of early - type galaxies , and would be unrelated to the evolution of massive galaxies . for the cluster 054 at @xmath13 we have a large data set of confirmed members with accurate colors ( van dokkum et al .",

    "dressler et al .  ( 1997 ) interpret the rapid evolution of the s0 fraction as evidence for transformation of spiral galaxies to s0 galaxies since @xmath135 . as pointed out by fabricant et al .",
    "( 2000 ) the decrease in the elliptical galaxy fraction over time requires substantial accretion onto clusters since @xmath135 .",

    "we ignore the fact that infalling spiral galaxies are also transformed into s0 galaxies .",
    "the evolution of the s0 galaxies is approximated reasonably well by a model with a constant transformation rate ( fig .",

    "this difference corresponds to a difference of @xmath139% in luminosity weighted age ( e.g. , worthey et al .",
    "this large difference arises because all elliptical galaxies formed their stars at extremely high redshift in this model , whereas the s0 galaxies are continuously transformed from star forming galaxies .",
    "this result is in conflict with studies of luminous early - type cluster galaxies at low and intermediate redshift , which indicate very little difference in luminosity weighted age between luminous elliptical and s0 galaxies in the cores of rich clusters ( e.g. , jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard 1996 , ellis et al .",

    "there are several ways in which this conflict can be solved .",
    "first , we can adapt the starformation histories .",
    "the model assumes that star formation in elliptical and s0 galaxies commenced at @xmath25 , and that their star formation rate was approximately constant from @xmath27 to @xmath30 . if star formation in elliptical galaxies commenced at a later time the systematic difference between elliptical and s0 galaxies",
    "is reduced . if @xmath140 for elliptical galaxies ( i.e. , star formation commenced at @xmath141 )",
    "the systematic difference in @xmath3 ratio between elliptical and s0 galaxies at @xmath18 is very small .",
    "however , it increases to @xmath142 in @xmath76 at @xmath19 .",
    "this corresponds to a systematic difference in @xmath52 color of @xmath143 , which is inconsistent with the low scatter in the cm relation of early type galaxies at @xmath13 ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "an alternative explanation for the small observed difference between luminous elliptical and s0 galaxies is that most of their stars were formed at very high redshift . in our models",
    ", this corresponds to low values of @xmath29 , the parameter describing the star formation history .",
    "the systematic difference in @xmath3 ratio scales linearly with @xmath29 , and for values of @xmath144 the systematic age difference between elliptical and s0 galaxies is @xmath145% at all redshifts .",
    "this explanation can be tested with the help of direct measurements of the star formation rates of the spiral galaxies in intermediate redshift clusters .",
    "a third possibility is that the effects of metallicity cancel the effects of age ( e.g. , worthey , trager , & faber 1996 , shioya & bekki 1998 , trager et al .",
    "the spiral galaxies would be enriched in metals compared to the elliptical galaxies of the same luminosity , and hence their colors would be redder , and their @xmath3 ratios higher than that of elliptical galaxies with the same age .",
    "this solution requires exact fine tuning between age and metallicity to keep the scatter small .",
    "it can be tested by direct observations of absorption line strengths of elliptical and s0 galaxies in nearby and distant clusters .",
    "the first studies do not appear to indicate significant differences between massive elliptical and s0 galaxies ( e.g. , kuntschner & davies 1998 , jones et al .",
    "2000 , kelson et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "finally , the separation of ellipticals and s0 s is very difficult , and it is not clear whether a clear distinction can be made between elliptical galaxies and s0 galaxies with @xmath146 luminosities ( e.g. , jrgensen & franx 1994 , rix & white 1990 ) .",
    "the latter study demonstrated that many elliptical galaxies contain significant disks , and would be classified as s0 galaxies when seen edge - on .",
    "jorgensen and franx argued that the coma elliptical and s0 galaxies can be approximated well by a population of galaxies which has a homogeneous distribution in the ratio of bulge light to total light . in this case , no clearcut distinction would exist between s0 galaxies and elliptical galaxies , and the evolutionary histories would not be so different between the galaxies .",
    "this might also explain the fact that the classifications between different authors agree well when the total fraction of elliptical and s0 galaxies is considered , but not when the classes are separated ( e.g. , andreon 1998 , fabricant et al .",
    "quantitative classifications would be able to resolve this issue , especially if detailed attention is given to the classification uncertainties due to projection effects .",
    "in this paper we have quantified the effects of morphological evolution on the observed properties of early - type galaxies in clusters at @xmath73 .",
    "a manifestation of morphological evolution is the `` progenitor bias '' : at high redshift , the progenitors of the youngest present - day early - type galaxies drop out of the sample . in general , the observed evolution of the mean luminosity and color of early - type galaxies is slower than the true evolution of all progenitors of early - type galaxies , and the scatter in luminosity and color is smaller .",
    "if morphological evolution is strong the observed mean evolution is similar to that of a single age stellar population formed at @xmath25 , and the scatter is approximately constant with redshift .",
    "these results can be derived analytically ( cf .",
    "appendix [ equations.sec ] ) .    in traditional models",
    "it is difficult to explain the low number fractions of early - type galaxies in distant clusters and the homogeneity and slow evolution of their stellar populations simultaneously .",
    "we have shown that the observed constant scatter in the cm relation and the fp and the slow evolution of the mean @xmath3 ratio are natural consequences of morphological evolution .",
    "observations of early - type galaxies in clusters at @xmath73 are well fitted by our models , and we can constrain the morphological transformation rate and the star formation histories of galaxies prior to transformation from the fits . the observed evolution of the early - type galaxy fraction",
    "constrains the transformation rate , the evolution of the mean @xmath3 ratio constrains the time of onset of star formation , and the scatter in the color - magnitude relation and the fundamental plane constrain the star formation histories of galaxies prior to transformation .",
    "the best fits are obtained if approximately 50% of present - day early - type galaxies were transformed from other morphological types at @xmath0 , star formation commenced at early times ( @xmath95 ) , and star formation was approximately constant prior to transformation .",
    "such gradual star formation histories are consistent with the low numbers of star burst galaxies seen in intermediate redshift clusters ( e.g. , abraham et al .  1996 , balogh et al .  1998 , ellingson et al .",
    "2000 ) , although some star bursts could be concealed by dust ( poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the observed color and luminosity evolution of early - type galaxies can be corrected for the effects of progenitor bias .",
    "we have shown that for a given morphological transformation rate the progenitor bias is proportional to the scatter in @xmath3 ratio or color .",
    "the correction is maximal if the scatter in the cm relation and the fp at @xmath18 is entirely due to age variations between galaxies .",
    "this maximum correction to the evolution of rest frame @xmath118 is approximately @xmath147 , and the correction to the evolution of rest frame @xmath148 is approximately @xmath149 .",
    "these corrections can easily be computed for other rest frame bands using stellar population synthesis models . as an example , the worthey ( 1994 ) and bruzual & charlot ( 2000 ) models give @xmath150 for solar metallicity and salpeter ( 1955 ) imf .",
    "therefore , the correction to @xmath151 is @xmath152 .",
    "the corrections are upper limits , because variations in dust content and metallicity probably contribute to the scatter . on the other hand , as pointed out by , e.g. , trager et al .",
    "( 2000 ) variations in metallicity and age may conspire to produce a low scatter .",
    "if this is confirmed the corrections may be larger than the values given here .",
    "because the mean luminosity and color evolution are underestimated , the mean age of the stars in early - type galaxies that is derived from them is overestimated in traditional models .",
    "we find that the mean luminosity weighted formation redshift of early - type galaxies can be as low as @xmath153 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , or @xmath8 for @xmath6 and @xmath9 , if the scatter in the cm relation and the fp is entirely caused by age variations .",
    "this result is important , because previous studies which ignored the effects of progenitor bias found much earlier formation epochs of the stars in early - type galaxies ( e.g. , ellis et al .",
    "1997 , stanford et al .",
    "1998 , van dokkum et al .",
    "the redshift range 2  3 is of interest because it is observationally accessible . in particular , our results are consistent with the idea that ( some ) ly - break galaxies are the star forming building blocks of present - day early - type galaxies in clusters ( baugh et al .  1998 ) .",
    "in our main analysis we treated the evolution of early - type galaxies as one class , but we also explored a model which separates the two classes . in our model ,",
    "only the s0 galaxies evolve morphologically from spiral galaxies , as advocated by dressler et al .",
    "the model predicts that colors and @xmath3 ratios of luminous s0 galaxies in nearby clusters are systematically offset from those of elliptical galaxies , in the sense that elliptical galaxies are redder and have higher @xmath3 ratios .",
    "this result is in conflict with studies of bright early - type galaxies in the cores of rich clusters , which generally find very little difference between elliptical and s0 galaxies ( e.g. , bower et al .",
    "1992 , ellis et al .",
    "there are several ways to resolve this conflict : star formation may have started later in the elliptical galaxies , or most of the star formation in elliptical and s0 galaxies must have occurred at very early times , long before morphological transformation to early - type galaxy . alternatively , there might be a conspiracy between age and metallicity ( e.g. , trager et al .",
    "2000 ) such that s0 galaxies have systematically higher metallicities than elliptical galaxies of the same luminosity .",
    "this can be tested by absorption line measurements ; current measurements do not indicate such an effect for cluster galaxies .",
    "finally , the separation between elliptical and s0 galaxies may not be very sharp .",
    "rix & white ( 1990 ) showed that many s0 galaxies will be classified as elliptical galaxies when not viewed edge - on .",
    "jrgensen and franx ( 1994 ) showed that the elliptical and s0 galaxies in coma can be modeled by a population of galaxies with a homogeneous distribution of bulge - to - total light ratio .",
    "hence , the galaxies which are classified as elliptical galaxies may also have evolved since @xmath21 .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results to predictions of semi - analytical galaxy formation models in cdm cosmologies ( white & frenk 1991 ; cole 1991 ) .",
    "because the morphologies of galaxies change quite rapidly in these models ( e.g. , baugh , cole , & frenk 1996 , kauffmann 1996 ) progenitor bias is an important ingredient . in particular , the models provide reasonable fits to the observed scatter in the cm relation ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; cole et al .",

    "2000 ) , even though galaxies in these simulations have quite complex ( star ) formation histories . however , in these complex models it is difficult to isolate and study specific effects such as the progenitor bias .",
    "the main contribution of our work is that we use very simple models with only three free parameters .",
    "we show that the effects of progenitor bias can be constrained directly from the observations , and it is straightforward to reproduce our results .",

    "<S> morphological and spectroscopic studies of high redshift clusters indicate that a significant fraction of present - day early - type galaxies was transformed from star forming galaxies at @xmath0 . on the other hand , the slow luminosity evolution of early - type galaxies and the low scatter in their color - magnitude relation indicate a high formation redshift of their stars . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we construct models which reconcile these apparently contradictory lines of evidence , and we quantify the effects of morphological evolution on the observed photometric properties of early - type galaxies in distant clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the case of strong morphological evolution the apparent luminosity and color evolution of early - type galaxies are similar to that of a single age stellar population formed at @xmath1 , irrespective of the true star formation history of the galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the scatter in age , and hence the scatter in color and luminosity , is approximately constant with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consequences of the `` progenitor bias '' : the progenitors of the youngest low redshift early - type galaxies drop out of the sample at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we construct models which reproduce the observed evolution of the number fraction of early - type galaxies in rich clusters and their color and luminosity evolution simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> our modelling indicates that @xmath2% of early - type galaxies were transformed from other galaxy types at @xmath0 , and their progenitor galaxies may have had roughly constant star formation rates prior to morphological transformation . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the progenitor bias on the evolution of the mean @xmath3 ratio and color can be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> the progenitor bias is a linear function of the scatter in the color - magnitude relation produced by age variations , and is maximal if the observed scatter is entirely due to age differences . after correcting the observed evolution of the mean @xmath4 ratio for the maximum progenitor bias we find that the mean luminosity weighted formation redshift of stars in early - type galaxies @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath8 for @xmath6 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis places the star formation epoch of early - type galaxies later than previous studies which ignored the effects of progenitor bias . </S>",
    "<S> the results are consistent with the idea that ( some ) ly - break galaxies are star forming building blocks of massive early - type galaxies in clusters .    </S>",
