    "the problem of momentum transport in accretion disks is widely believed to require hydrodynamic or hydromagnetic turbulence for its resolution .",
    "the origin of this turbulence may be sought in the instability of laminar solutions of the equations of hydromagnetics , solutions that are compatible with the geometry of accretion disks .",
    "the recent history of these efforts has taken the form of first recognizing such an instability mechanism , and then trying to incorporate that mechanicsm into realistic disk models .",
    "the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) mechanism , originally discovered by @xcite and @xcite and first applied to accretion disks in @xcite , is of this kind ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it appears in rotating , magnetized systems in which the specific angular momentum increases outward and in which the magnetic field is weak enough that rotational effects are not overwhelmed by magnetic tension .    a second mechanism , that of the elliptical instability considered by @xcite and others @xcite , is also consistent with the accretion - disk setting .",
    "this instability mechanism has been reviewed by @xcite . in the setting considered by goodman et .",
    "al . , it appears to require a secondary in order to enforce departure from rotational symmetry of the streamlines via a tidal potential .",
    "this is certainly appropriate for binary systems but it is likely that , even in the absence of a secondary , the laminar motion in the plane of the disk would not be accurately circular , so the elliptical - instability mechanism would appear to be a candidate of considerable generality . it does not require a magnetic field .",
    "one of the conclusions of the present paper is that it further persists in the presence of a magnetic field . in the idealized",
    "setting of the present problem , the latter may be of arbitrarily large strength .",
    "however , we also argue that in the setting of a disk geometry , there may indeed be a limit on the field strength .    in this paper",
    "we therefore investigate the interaction of a vertical magnetic field with flow on elliptical streamlines , on the ground that both magnetic fields and noncircular streamlines are likely ingredients in accretion - disk settings .",
    "there are similarities with and differences from previous work on effect of magnetic fields on the elliptical instability @xcite , which are discussed in  [ discussion ] .",
    "we consider flow on elliptical streamlines together with a magnetic field and investigate linear stability theory .",
    "the underlying equations are the euler equations of fluid dynamics @xmath0 and the induction equation @xmath1 we shall assume that div@xmath2 and div@xmath3 and that the fluid is unbounded .",
    "it is easy to check that the following steady fields represent a solution of the preceding system : @xmath4 here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constants , and a constant may also be added to the pressure term .",
    "more general exact solutions of the combined fluid / magnetic equations exist in an unbounded domain @xcite ; the case in hand is probably the simplest of these .",
    "let @xmath7 be replaced by @xmath8 in equations ( [ euler ] , [ induc ] ) above , and linearize . the resulting perturbation equations are @xmath9 and @xmath10 together with the conditions that @xmath11 and @xmath12 be solenoidal .",
    "these equations allow _ rotating - wave _ solutions of the form @xmath13 where the expression @xmath14 denotes the inner product . because @xmath11 and @xmath12 are solenoidal , the conditions @xmath15 must be satisfied .    write @xmath16 then on substituting the rotating - wave expressions from equation ( [ r-w.ansatz ] ) into the perturbation equations one finds @xmath17 equation ( [ keq ] ) can be solved to give @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constants .",
    "the pressure coefficient @xmath21 can be eliminated with the aid of the solenoidal condition ( [ solenoidal ] ) .",
    "one finds @xmath22 the equation for @xmath23 now takes the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 it s convenient to break the six - dimensional system consisting of equations ( [ new.veq ] ) and ( [ weq ] ) into two , one of size four and the other of size two : @xmath26 where @xmath27 these four equations are self - contained and the remaining equations , @xmath28 may be integrated once the expression @xmath29 is found by solving the four - dimensional system above .",
    "equations ( [ keq ] ) , ( [ veq]),([weq ] ) and ( [ phieq ] ) imply that @xmath30 thus in solving this system we need to impose the conditions that these inner products are zero initially ; this will thereafter maintain the incompressibility conditions ( [ solenoidal ] ) .",
    "the incompressibility condition provides an alternative way of finding @xmath31 and @xmath32 once the equations for @xmath33 have been solved , provided that @xmath34 the only cases for which @xmath35 can vanish are those for which the combinations @xmath36 and @xmath37 are also found to vanish on solving the four - dimensional system above .",
    "it is not difficult to show that there can be no instability associated with such a solution ( see in particular the equivalent system ( [ c_eq ] ) below ) .",
    "accordingly , we henceforth consider only perturbations with vertical wave number @xmath34      we change to new variables to facilitate subsequent calculations .",
    "@xmath38 this is a time - dependent ( periodic ) change of variables since @xmath39 is periodic in @xmath40 .",
    "the equations to be solved take the form @xmath41 in these variables , with ( we have put @xmath42 here to agree with earlier conventions ) @xmath43      the coefficients of the matrix @xmath44 depend on the phase angle @xmath20 appearing in the expressions ( [ ksol ] ) above for the wave vector @xmath45 . for purposes of studying stability",
    ", we may set @xmath46 .",
    "this is easily seen by making the substitution @xmath47 , which eliminates @xmath20 from the equation . for the remainder of this work",
    "we take @xmath48    the system ( [ c_eq ] ) presents a floquet problem ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : the stability of the chosen steady solution @xmath49 depends on whether there are solutions of this system that grow exponentially with time .",
    "this is settled by finding the floquet multiplier matrix @xmath50 .",
    "the latter is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath51 be the fundamental matrix solution of equation ( [ c_eq ] ) that reduces to the identity at @xmath52 . then , since the periodicity of @xmath44 is @xmath53 , @xmath54 if any eigenvalue @xmath55 of @xmath50 has modulus exceeding one , this implies that there is indeed an exponentially growing solution .",
    "it is familiar in conservative problems that    [ quartet ] whenever @xmath55 is an eigenvalue of the floquet matrix , so also are its inverse @xmath56 and its complex conjugate @xmath57 .",
    "the first statement of this proposition is a typically a consequence of canonical hamiltonian structure , the second a consequence of the reality of the underlying problem .",
    "however , the system ( [ c_eq ] ) is not canonical , and the matrix appearing in it is not real",
    ". we can nevertheless establish these familiar properties of the eigenvalues directly from the system ( [ c_eq ] ) , as follows .",
    "the time - reversal invariance of the physical problem is reflected in the existence of a reversing symmetry @xmath58 of the matrix @xmath44 above : @xmath59 , implying that whenever @xmath60 is a solution so also is @xmath61 .",
    "since the solutions of the floquet problem have the structure @xmath62 , there must also be a solution @xmath63 but the eigenvalues of the floquet multiplier matrix @xmath50 are the values @xmath64 .",
    "this shows that if @xmath55 is an eigenvalue of @xmath50 , so also is @xmath65 .",
    "similarly , under matrix transformation @xmath66 , @xmath44 goes to its complex conjugate .",
    "this shows that @xmath67 , i.e. , that @xmath50 and its conjugate have the same eigenvalues .",
    "immediate consequences of proposition [ quartet ] are the following : first , in the stable case , eigenvalues of @xmath50 lie on the unit circle ; second , if , as parameters change , an eigenvalue is at the onset of instability , it must have multiplicity two ( or higher ) .",
    "the latter conclusion is because , in the complex @xmath55-plane , the dangerous eigenvalue @xmath55 must leave the unit circle simultaneously with @xmath68 , which lies along the same ray as @xmath69 and therefore coincides with it when they both lie on the unit circle .",
    "thus a necessary condition for the onset of linear instability is a resonance where two floquet multipliers coincide .",
    "there are three dimensionless parameters that figure in this problem .",
    "we call them @xmath70 and @xmath71 : @xmath72 thus @xmath73 represents the departure of the streamlines of the unperturbed flow from axial symmetry . in these equations @xmath74 and represents the length of the wave vector if @xmath75 .",
    "the magnetic parameter @xmath71 depends not only on the strength of the unperturbed magnetic field but also on the wavelength of the perturbation .    in the matrix @xmath44",
    "above , the magnetic field enters through the parameter @xmath76 ( which is a measure of the magnetic tension force ) , and we shall continue to use this notation for the present , on the understanding that @xmath77 .",
    "it is also clear that we can use @xmath78 rather than @xmath73 to measure the departure from rotational symmetry , and we shall do this in some cases .",
    "the floquet matrix is @xmath79 one could map out the stability and instability regions in the @xmath80 parameter space numerically by integrating the system ( [ c_eq ] ) systematically for many values of these parameters .",
    "we in fact do this for a selection of parameter values in  [ numerical ] below .",
    "however , in this and the following section we present the outlines and results of an asymptotic analysis based on regarding @xmath73 as a small parameter ( details are presented in the appendices ) .",
    "this is more revealing than the numerical reults on their own .",
    "it is also of considerable importance in interpreting the numerical results , and is quite accurate even for values of @xmath73 that are not very small ( cf .",
    "figure [ hydromode ] below ) .",
    "the calculation proceeds in two steps ; finding @xmath50 , and calculating its eigenvalues .",
    "the asymptotic analysis is facilitated by the circumstance that , if we put @xmath81 , the coefficient matrix @xmath82 ( say ) of equation ( [ d_matrix ] ) becomes constant .",
    "we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath82 in appendix [ subsec : zop ] .",
    "there are two complex conjugate pairs of modes .",
    "one pair reduces to the ordinary hydrodynamic modes in the limit @xmath83 .",
    "the second pair are magnetic modes with zero frequency at @xmath84 . in the weak field limit",
    ", the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy is @xmath85 for the modified hydrodynamic modes and @xmath86 for the magnetic modes . if @xmath87 , the kinetic and magnetic energies are near equipartition for both types of mode .",
    "we now turn to a brief description of the asymptotic ( or perturbation ) procedure . in",
    "what follows the parameter @xmath71 will be held fixed so , to simplify the notation , we suppress the dependence of the floquet matrix on this parameter : @xmath88 .",
    "we shall need the taylor expansion @xmath89 where the dots indicate higher - order terms in @xmath73 and @xmath90 .",
    "the reason for allowing variations with @xmath91 as well as variations with @xmath73 is that the region in the @xmath92 plane where instability occurs is typically a wedge with apex at a point @xmath93 and boundaries @xmath94 , where the slopes @xmath95 and @xmath96 are to be found .",
    "figure [ hydromode ] below ) .",
    "we will therefore consider @xmath91 of the form @xmath97 where @xmath98 may be regarded as a fixed parameter to be chosen later .",
    "this will lead us to the widest of wedges in the @xmath99 plane , of width @xmath100 , excluding other wedges of width @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "these higher - order wedges typically occupy a tiny fraction of the parameter space ( see figure [ ho ] below ) . as a result of the representation ( [ mu_expansion ] )",
    "we may write @xmath103 where @xmath104    the matrix @xmath105 is given in appendix [ subsec : zop ] , together with an expression for @xmath106 . we effect a change of basis , which diagonalizes @xmath105 and simplifies the calculation of @xmath106 , in appendix [ distinct ] .",
    "the elements of @xmath107 are calculated in appendix [ subsec : elements ] .",
    "denote by @xmath108 the characteristic polynomial of the floquet multiplier matrix @xmath109 and its roots by @xmath110 .",
    "a necessary condition for stability is that each root lie on the unit circle . to explore the onset of instability for various parameter values ,",
    "we shall obtain the characteristic polynomial @xmath111 in the form @xmath112 and exploit our knowledge of the roots of @xmath113 to obtain the roots of @xmath114 in the form of a puiseux expansion in @xmath73 @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of this expansion depends on the multiplicities of the roots @xmath115 of @xmath113 , the characteristic polynomial of the unperturbed floquet matrix @xmath105 .",
    "these roots are given by the expressions @xmath116 where the @xmath117 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath82 given in appendix [ subsec : zop ] ( equation [ evals ] ) ; they are all distinct . however , it is possible for the multipliers @xmath118 to be repeated even when , as in the present case , the @xmath117 are distinct : if @xmath119 for an integer @xmath120 , then @xmath121 .",
    "a necessary condition for the onset of instability is that there be a double ( or higher ) root of the characteristic equation , and we henceforth restrict consideration to the case of double roots . for definiteness",
    ", we suppose @xmath122 .",
    "then the puiseux expansion takes the form @xmath123 substituting into the characteristic equation ( and taking into account that @xmath113 and @xmath124 both vanish at @xmath125 ) yields for the coefficient @xmath126 of the leading - order correction the equation @xmath127 the two values of @xmath126 give the generic expressions for the change in a double eigenvalue , yielding a pair of roots branching from the double root @xmath125 .",
    "however , if @xmath128 this expression is inadequate and one must proceed to the next term in order to determine the effect of the perturbation on the stability . under the present assumptions ,",
    "it is indeed the case that @xmath129 vanishes at @xmath125 , as we show in appendix [ subsec : charpoly ] .",
    "we must suppose then that the expansion of @xmath130 is carried out to second order in @xmath73 : @xmath131 then in the puiseux expansion above @xmath132 so @xmath133 and @xmath134 is found by solving the quadratic equation @xmath135    in the case at hand , the common value of @xmath125 and @xmath136 lies on the unit circle . in order for the perturbed values of the floquet multipliers to lie _ off _ the unit circle ( and",
    "therefore imply instability ) , it is easy to verify that it is necessary and sufficient that @xmath137 have a nonvanishing real part .",
    "thus if we define @xmath138 we have the following criterion :    [ stab_crit ] either @xmath139 is pure - imaginary and we infer stability ( to leading order in @xmath73 ) , or @xmath140 and we infer instability .    the magnitude of the real part of @xmath141 is also related to the growthrate of the instability . if we define an instability increment @xmath142 then @xmath143 and the growthrate is equal to @xmath144 , to leading order in @xmath73 .",
    "the long calculations that lead to the coefficients appearing in equation ( [ beta1_eq ] ) are carried out in the appendices . in the notation employed there , equation ( [ beta1_eq ] ) therefore takes the form @xmath145 \\right\\ } \\alpha + \\left| \\begin{array}{cc } \\tilde{j}_{11}+ 2\\pi \\nu \\sigma _ 1/\\mu & \\tilde{j}_{12}\\\\ \\tilde{j}_{21}&\\tilde{j}_{22 } + 2\\pi \\nu   \\sigma _",

    "there are obvious modifications of this formula if @xmath147 instead of @xmath148 .",
    "the resonant cases for @xmath75 ( circular streamlines ) are those parameter values @xmath149 such that @xmath150 , where @xmath45 is an integer .",
    "we ll find that these can be written in the form @xmath151 ( e.g. , equation ( [ pure_hydro_res ] below ) . since @xmath75 ,",
    "the @xmath91 values in question are those that were designated @xmath152 in equation ( [ mu_expansion ] ) above .",
    "we no longer need the designation @xmath152 and , in the relations below , use the symbol @xmath91 in its place .    if @xmath153 the matrix @xmath154 is diagonal ( see equation [ newjtilde ] below ) and equation ( [ beta1_eq_3 ] ) has the roots @xmath155 and @xmath156 where @xmath157 for @xmath158 it is easy to check that these diagonal entries are pure - imaginary ( cf .",
    "equations [ diagonal_eq ] and [ tinverse ] below ) and therefore , in accordance with proposition [ stab_crit ] , there is no instability to leading order in @xmath73 .",
    "we therefore now consider the only cases @xmath159 that can lead to instability to this order .",
    "recall that the original parameters of the problem are @xmath73  representing the departure from axial symmetry of the undisturbed streamlines ",

    "the resonant modes consist of a hydrodynamic mode and a purely magnetic mode ( one frequency would vanish if @xmath84 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath191 , implying that @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194    thus the ratio @xmath91 changes from @xmath195 at @xmath196 to @xmath172 as @xmath197 .",
    "this represents a mixed mode , i.e. , the resonance is between a purely hydrodynamic mode and a purely magnetic one . evaluating the integrals and solving the quadratic ( [ beta1_eq_3 ] ) , we find    @xmath198    where @xmath199\\left[\\frac{2\\nu } { \\mu } - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\mu ^2\\right)\\left(3\\mu ^2 -1 \\right)\\right].\\ ] ] if @xmath200 then @xmath141 is pure - imaginary and the unperturbed configuration is stable , so instability prevails if and only if @xmath201 .",
    "instability can indeed occur and has its maximal increment when @xmath202 .",

    "the asymptotic formulas imply that the maximal growthrate ( or equivalently the maximal instability increment @xmath236 ) for each of the wedges of instability tends to a fixed value as the magnetic parameter @xmath71 increases .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ grra ] .",
    "however , the asymptotic formulas for the growthrates are less accurate than those for the stability boundaries , for the larger values of @xmath78 .",
    "in identifying these tongues , we have made repeated use of the asymptotic formulas presented earlier .",

    "our first conclusion is that this elliptical instability persists in the presence of a vertical magnetic field : the latter decreases the maximum growthrate but fails to suppress the instability , no matter how large the magnetic - field parameter becomes .",
    "it can be compared with the conclusion of @xcite that a toroidal magnetic field has a stabilizing influence .",
    "kerswell s analysis holds for small @xmath73 only and shows that the growthrate decreases with magnetic field in that limit .",
    "our result , which holds for a vertical magnetic field , shows a similar trend for small values of the magnetic - field parameter , but this trend never results in complete stabilization of the elliptical instability with increasing magnetic field .",
    "a second conclusion is that there are further instabilities associated with the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "one of these , for which the eigenvector is a mixture of hydrodynamic and magnetic modes , occurs for all values of the magnetic field parameter .",
    "another , for which the eigenvector is a combination of magnetic modes only , sets in for values of the magnetic - field parameter exceeding a certain threshold value ( @xmath250 ) . in all three of these instabilities , for large magnetic fields",
    ", the wave vector makes only a small angle with the plane of the unperturbed flow , reflecting the familiar tendency for dynamics to become nearly 2-dimensional in a strong , well ordered magnetic field .",

    "although the unstable fraction of the @xmath251 plane decreases with increasing @xmath71 ( except for a very slight maximum at @xmath252 2.18 , reflecting the onset of instability between magnetic modes ) , the separation between the unstable wedges also decreases .",
    "while the nonlinear evolution of the unstable system is beyond the scope of this work , the destabilization of a nearly continuous swath of parameter space may have consequences for the interactions between unstable modes .",
    "in all three cases , the maximum instability increment tends to @xmath253 , i.e. , the maximum growthrate of the unstable modes tends , in dimensional units , to @xmath254 .",
    "all three of these instabilities may be relevant in accretion - disk settings . in systems of finite thickness @xmath243 , however , the instability is suppressed if the alfvn speed @xmath245 exceeds a critical value of order @xmath255 .",
    "magnetorotational instabilities are quenched at approximately the same fieldstrength @xcite .",
    "the growth rate of magnetoelliptical instabilities is smaller than that of magnetorotational instabilities by a factor of order @xmath73 , and thus they are not necessarily the primary instability in magnetized disks",
    ". they may well play a secondary role by breaking up eddies or vortices generated by other mechanisms .",
    "magnetoelliptic instabilities may also occur in the inner parts of barred galaxies , in which the gas flow is slightly elliptical and the magnetic field , at least in the milky way , has a vertical component @xcite .",
    "in such settings , the instabilities could be a source of turbulence , possibly affecting the mass supply to a central compact object .",
