    "in the recent years the madelung fluid description of quantum mechanics has been applied to some fields where the quantum formalism is a useful tool for describing the evolution of classical ( quantum - like ) systems and studying the dispersionless or semiclassical limit of nonlinear partial differential equations of schrdinger type , @xcite .",
    "the madelung fluid representation , proposed first by @xcite , being a complex quantity , represents a solution of the schrdinger equation , in terms of modulus and phase .",
    "substituted to the schrdinger equation it allows to obtain a pair of nonlinear hydrodynamic type equations .",
    "thus , the madelung fluid equations are nonlinear system of pdes , while the schrdinger equation is the linear one .",
    "then , the madelung transform is a complex linearization transform , similar to the cole - hopf transformation , linearizing the nonlinear burgers equation in terms of the linear heat equation , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nonlinear models admitting such type of direct linearization are called by f. calogero as c - integrable models .    in this work ,",
    "we construct a madelung fluid model with time variable parameters as dissipative quantum fluid and linearize it in terms of schrdinger equation with time dependent parameters .",
    "it allows us to find exact solution of the nonlinear madelung system in terms of solutions to the schrdinger equation and the corresponding classical linear ode with variable frequency and damping .",
    "moreover , the madelung system written for the complex velocity field takes the form of a nonlinear complex schrdinger - burgers equation , which exact solutions we obtain using complex cole - hopf transformation . as known , in the usual cole - hopf transformation zeros of the linear heat equation lead to poles in the corresponding burgers equation .",
    "similarly , in our case , by the complex cole - hopf transformation zeros of the schrdinger equation transform to pole singularities in the complex schrdinger - burgers equation .",
    "thus , using exact solutions of the linear problem , one can find also the dynamics of the poles in the corresponding nonlinear problem . as an exactly solvable model",
    ", we describe a dissipative nonlinear complex schrdinger - burgers equation of caldirola - kanai type , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "we can use our recent work on exactly solvable dissipative systems , such as quantum sturm - liouville problems ref.@xcite .",
