    "exploring the relationship between structure and function of real systems has been improved markedly in recent years , as it has become clear that the impressive function of real systems is closely related to their particular structures @xcite .",

    "such noise - improved signal transmission is further observed in complex networks @xcite .",
    "however , the noise - improved signal transmission relies heavily on the proper intensity of noise which it is hard to be tuned in practice .",
    "it is therefore quite important to seek a specific structure by which the transmission can be efficiently improved , instead of by the well - tuned noise .    in this paper , we propose a modified one - way chain model with a y - shaped structure and study how such structure affects signal transmission in the chain . unlike the classical one - way chain with a single source node , the y - shaped one - way chain has two disconnected source nodes that receive the same input signal .",
    "we find that the y - shaped one - way chain can maintain long - distance signal transmissions without amplitude attenuation , no matter the input signal is periodic or aperiodic .",
    "we also find that the enhanced signal transmission in the y - shaped one - way chain is much effective than the noise - improved signal transmission in the classical one - way chain .",

    "we finally analyze the mechanism of the resonant - like phenomena shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "firstly , we explain the single resonant - like dependency for the classical one - way chain with one source node , i.e. , @xmath23 and @xmath74 are set in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) . when @xmath70 , the oscillation of the source node is small , restricting in one of the two stable fixed points .",
    "when @xmath68 is increased to @xmath166 , the oscillation of the source node can jump to the other stable fixed point by noise perturbation , see fig . [",
    "fig:10](a ) . because the perturbations are not sufficient , the jumping rate is small and the oscillation may stay there for a long time until the next jumping .",
    "thus the oscillation of the source node is still small at @xmath166 .",
    "continue increasing @xmath68 to @xmath167 , the jumping rate between the two stable fixed points is obviously improved , which increases the oscillation amplitude , see fig .",
    "[ fig:10](b ) .",
    "when @xmath168 , the jumping rate is sharply improved , so the oscillation is no longer centered on the stable fixed points @xmath169 but on @xmath170 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:10](c ) .",
    "however , further increase in @xmath68 will increase the randomness of the oscillation ( not shown here ) . considering all of these factors ,",
    "the source node can only generate a large output at @xmath168 , showing a resonant peak over there . through one - way coupling",
    ", the output of the source node will propagate to the subsequent nodes ( @xmath171 ) , which results in the stochastic resonance phenomena as observed in figs . [",
    "fig:7](g)-(i ) .",
    "secondly , we explain the double resonant - like dependency for the y - shaped one - way chain with @xmath23 .",
    "as mentioned above , when @xmath166 , there is a small probability that a single source node may jump to the other stable fixed point , remaining there for a long time until it jumps back to the initial fixed point . in this way , the two source nodes in the y - shaped one - way chain may occasionally oscillate in different stable fixed points for long time intervals , although given the same initial condition @xmath23 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:10](d ) .",
    "considering that the signal transmission is largely enhanced if the two source nodes oscillate in different stable fixed points [ see sec .",
    "iv b ] , the transmission in the y - shaped one - way chain will be sometimes largely enhanced at @xmath166 . by increasing @xmath68 to @xmath167 ,",
    "the time intervals for the two source nodes simultaneously oscillating at different fixed points reduce dramatically [ see fig . [ fig:10](e ) ] , indicating a decrease in signal transmission .",
    "these are the reasons why @xmath14 shows the first local peak at @xmath166 .",
    "when @xmath68 is increased to @xmath168 , there is no obvious interval between two continuous jumps , see fig .",
    "[ fig:10](f ) . during this process ,",
    "the collective behavior of the two source nodes @xmath172 is analogous to the individual @xmath173 or @xmath174 , i.e. , the two source nodes can be seen as a single one .",
    "this analogy in dynamics implies that the y - shaped one - way chain shows a similar signal transmission to that of the classical one - way chain for large @xmath68 . as a result ,",
    "the signal transmission in the y - shaped one - way chain is also largely enhanced at @xmath168 , resulting in the second peak over there .",
    "obviously , both the single and double resonant - like dependencies are the stochastic resonance phenomena , since the signal transmissions are improved by noise .",
    "however , as the specific y - shaped structure allows the two source nodes oscillate in distinct fixed points for small noise , we thus refer the enhanced signal transmission in the region @xmath175 as structure - noise - improved transmission [ see figs . [ fig:7](d)-(f ) ] .     of the source node(s ) .",
    "left panels for one source node : ( a ) @xmath166 , ( b ) @xmath167 , and ( c ) @xmath168 ; right panels for two source nodes with given the same initial condition @xmath176 : ( d ) @xmath166 , ( e ) @xmath167 , and ( f ) @xmath168 .",
    "red and green lines denote @xmath177 of the two source nodes , blue lines denote the their collective dynamics @xmath172 . ]",
    "in conclusions , we have studied the signal transmission in a y - shaped one - way chain and found an extraordinarily of such specific structure to improve signal transmission .",
    "we have also studied the robustness of the y - shaped structure - improved transmission to the noise perturbation and input signal regularity .",
