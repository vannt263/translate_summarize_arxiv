    "blazars are active galaxies with a jet closely aligned with the earth line of sight @xcite .",
    "these objects are the most commonly detected type of extragalactic source at very high energies ( vhe ; @xmath1100 gev ) .",
    "the vhe gamma rays which propagate through the intergalactic medium are absorbed by extragalactic background light ( ebl ) photons via pair production @xcite .",
    "the ebl is difficult to directly measure due to strong foreground sources @xcite .",
    "various methods are used to estimate the density of the ebl .",
    "a selection of ebl models include a semi - analytical model @xcite , an observationally based model which utilizes observations of _ k_-band rest frame galaxy luminosity functions in combination with galaxy spectral energy distribution fractions @xcite and a model based on starlight emission and dust re - emission templates @xcite .",
    "each of these estimate photon densities are above the lower limits set by galaxy counts @xcite , and below the limits set by detection of extragalactic vhe photons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the interaction between vhe and ebl photons produces a  gamma - ray horizon , \" limiting the distance to which vhe sources can be detected .",
    "3c279 is the most distant vhe emitting blazar with a spectroscopically measured redshift . by spectroscopically measured , we mean the detection of emission and/or absorption lines of the host galaxy .",
    "3c279 is a flat - spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) at @xmath7 @xcite and was observed above 50 gev by magic during a flare @xcite .",
    "fsrqs are blazars which show emission lines with an equivalent width of @xmath8 , providing strong host - galaxy emission and absorption for spectroscopic distance measurements .",
    "conversely , bl lacertae - type blazars display weak or no emission / absorption lines , and lack evidence for a ca h@xmath9k break in their optical spectrum @xcite . with this definition ,",
    "it is not surprising that there are vhe - detected bl lac objects that lack definite spectroscopic redshift measurements .",
    "some notable vhe blazars without spectroscopic redshift are kuv00311 - 1938 , pg1553 + 113 , 3c66a , s50716 + 714 and pks1424 + 240 ( pg1424 + 240 ) .",
    "kuv00311 - 1938 , detected at tev energies by hess @xcite , has a tentative redshift of 0.61 from the observation of five features in a poor signal - to - noise ratio ( sn ) spectrum @xcite .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy with improved sn did not confirm any @xmath10 features , although an intervening mg  ii absorption system at @xmath11 , not visible in the previous spectrum , was observed and sets a lower limit on the blazar distance @xcite .",
    "since bl lac objects display bright and featureless spectra , strict lower limits on the redshifts can be inferred through observation of far - uv ( fuv ) absorption by the low-@xmath12 intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "this method has been applied to pg1553 + 113 , 3c66a , and s50716 + 714 showing lower limits of @xmath130.395 , 0.3347 and 0.2314 ( @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "we apply this technique to the vhe - detected blazar pks1424 + 240 , constraining the blazar to @xmath0 , making it the most distant vhe - detected blazar thus far .",
    "pks1424@xmath9240 was observed under a _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst )",
    "program ( 12612 , pi : stocke ) which uses flaring blazars as probes of intervening , weak igm absorption .",
    "pks1424@xmath9240 is one of @xmath14 objects monitored by a network of automated telescopes : the katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait , @xcite ) , the  nf/ observatory \" @xcite and the small and moderate - aperture remote telescope system ( smarts , @xcite ) .",
    "optical photometry in april of 2012 indicated that pks1424@xmath9240 was sufficiently bright to trigger a five - orbit hst / cos observation .",
    "the blazar was observed on 19 april 2012 , with the medium resolution ( @xmath15 ) , far - uv gratings g130 m ( @xmath16  , 6.4 ksec ) and g160 m ( @xmath17  , 7.9 ksec ) .",
    "the flux - calibrated , one - dimensional spectra were obtained from the mikulski archive for space telescopes and combined with the standard idl procedures described in @xcite .",
    "additional analysis details are given in @xcite .",
    "the combined data show a continuum flux level of @xmath18 and a median sn per 7-pixel resolution element of @xmath19 over the entire spectrum .",
    "the spectrum was normalized with an iterative , spline - based procedure and an automated line - finding algorithm was used to locate @xmath20 absorption features @xcite .",
    "we set a firm , observational lower limit to the source redshift by examining intervening absorbers .",
    "we see absorption consistent with higher - order h  i lyman absorption at @xmath21 ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the presence of absorption profiles consistent with ly@xmath2 and ly@xmath3 at three distinct redshifts provides unambiguous line identifications of absorbing gas along the line of sight ( table  1 ) .",
    "the measurements summarized in table  1 are made using voigt - profile fits to the lines .",
    "the significance levels are calculated from the observed equivalent widths and flux errors and are calculated via the methods described in @xcite .",
    "the line identifications are bolstered in two cases by low - significance ly@xmath22 detections .",
    "in other cases where h  i absorption is used to constrain blazar distance , the _ lack _ of absorbers past a certain redshift is used to place a statistical upper limit . for pks1424@xmath9240 , the ly@xmath23 forest extends to the red end of the fuv detector ( @xmath24  , @xmath25 ) .",
    "absorbers at higher redshift are detected through paired ly@xmath2 and ly@xmath3 lines visible at @xmath26 .",
    "however this technique is less sensitive to h  i absorbers than detection via ly@xmath23 since both ly@xmath2  _ and _ ly@xmath3 lines must be detected to unambiguously identify an absorber and @xmath27 is only @xmath28 that of ly@xmath23 .",
    "no h  i absorbers are seen between the reddest system ( @xmath6 ) and the red edge of the detector in ly@xmath2 ( @xmath29 ) for a line - free path length @xmath30 .",
    "the spectral data quality is such that we should detect lines at @xmath31 ( @xmath32 m , @xmath33m ) at a @xmath34 level .",
    "the frequency of lines of this strength or higher at low redshift is @xmath35 @xcite , so we would expect @xmath36 absorbers to be present if the source were at @xmath37 . since no lines are seen , we can rule out @xmath37 at approximately @xmath38 confidence .",
    "more detailed simulations may refine the redshift upper limit , but near - uv spectra and a direct search for ly@xmath23 lines at @xmath39 will be less ambiguous .",
    "the redshift lower limit is significantly higher than the conservative estimates of @xmath40 @xcite and @xmath41 @xcite , derived from host - galaxy assumptions .",
    "notably , the redshift estimates in @xcite are in close agreement with other blazar distance limits derived from the observation of absorption systems .",
    "the redshift limit for pks1424 + 240 is also below the upper limits of @xmath42 and 1.19 derived from correcting vhe observations for ebl absorption to match the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) data in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the energy- and redshift - dependent absorption of vhe gamma rays by the ebl can be estimated using the model - specific optical depth , @xmath43 , where the absorption - corrected ( deabsorbed ) flux , @xmath44 , is estimated from the observed flux , @xmath45 , using the relation @xmath46 .",
    "we investigate the deabsorbed vhe spectrum of pks1424 + 240 at the redshift lower limit of @xmath6 , using three models to explore the effect of relatively low , medium , and high levels of ebl photon density .",
    "the lowest density model used is from @xcite , which estimates a @xmath47 ebl spectral energy distribution nearing the required lower limits on the ebl set by galaxy counts .",
    "we use the @xcite model to estimate vhe absorption by an intermediate level ebl density and the @xcite model to represent a relatively high level of ebl density .",
    "the blazar vhe spectral index can be used to estimate the ebl spectral properties under the assumption that the intrinsic spectrum , characterized by the power - law @xmath48 , can not be harder than @xmath49 , as described in @xcite .",
    "the limit is physically motivated by the shock acceleration paradigm , where the hardest index obtained for the accelerated leptons is 1.5 .",
    "notably , the hardest blazar spectral index measured by the lat has an index of 1.1 but is in statistical agreement with the theoretical limit @xcite .",
    "since the lat is most sensitive to photons at energies where ebl absorption is negligible , the indices derived from lat observations reflect the intrinsically emitted gamma - ray spectrum . a more conservative limit equal to the lat measured index",
    "can be placed under the assumption that blazars do not harden with increasing energy . for pks1424 + 240 ,",
    "the contemporaneous lat - measured index is 1.80@xmath500.07 @xcite ( figure  3 ) .",
    "a power - law fit can be applied to the absorption - corrected points for the redshift lower limit of @xmath6 , as summarized in table 2 for each of the ebl models .",
    "the fitted indices for the deabsorbed spectra using the relatively low and medium ebl models ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) are well within the @xmath51=1.5 and @xmath52 limits .",
    "however , the @xmath53 index resulting from deabsorption with the relatively more opaque model from @xcite is below , but still consistent with , either of the expectations .",
    "improved gamma - ray observations may reveal that this model is too dense .",
    "other explanations , such as time - dependent stochastic accelerated inverse - compton scenarios @xcite and internal gamma - gamma absorption @xcite , can also account for unusually hard vhe emission spectra .",
    "intergalactic gamma - ray opacity due to the ebl has direct consequences for the estimation of the intrinsic gamma - ray spectra of extragalactic vhe targets , with the source emitted flux being suppressed by @xmath54 .",
    "this energy- and redshift - dependent flux suppression requires sources to be exponentially brighter at larger distances in order to be detectable at vhe .",
    "the opacities probed through the vhe observation of blazars with redshift information provides insight into the possibility of a pair - production anomaly , as investigated in @xcite . in the seven vhe blazar spectra which probe opacities in the range 1@xmath55 , an upturn of",
    "the absorption - corrected spectra is apparent with a significance of 4.2@xmath56 at the @xmath57 transition energy . due to the different energies of the @xmath57 transition for the blazars studied ,",
    "source - intrinsic features are an unlikely explanation.this study was limited by the number of vhe blazars probing opacities @xmath57 with known redshift .",
    "pks1424 + 240 can now be included in the study , expanding the limited opacity parameter space available . before the determination of the redshift lower limit of pks1424 + 240 ,",
    "the highest sampled gamma - ray optical depth probed was associated with the detection of 3c279 during an elevated state , probing a @xmath58 , 3.9 or 4.3 when estimated with the @xcite models , respectively .",
    "now , with pks1424 + 240 , the highest opacity sampled is between 4.1 and 5.3 ( if estimated with the @xcite and @xcite models , respectively . )",
    "we show the highest opacity sampled by the vhe detection of 3c279 compared to the opacity probed with the detection of pks1424 + 240 in figure  2 , as derived for the @xcite model .",
    "the spectral points are plotted along with the @xmath59 horizons . for reference",
    ", we also show published spectral points of every vhe - detected blazar with a spectroscopically measured redshift above 0.2 ( four sources , as compared to the more than 30 vhe blazars with @xmath60 ) .",
    "since the redshift of pks1424 + 240 represents a lower limit , the maximum opacity sampled by the vhe detection is illustrated with a right - pointing arrow .",
    "the observed gamma - ray peak is reproduced from @xcite in figure  3 , illustrating the contemporaneous lat and veritas data with black squares and circles , respectively . additionally , we correct the observed vhe spectrum for ebl absorption at the minimum redshift of @xmath6 using the intermediate model @xcite , illustrated by grey circular points .",
    "absorption of the lat data is negligible .",
    "the lat and veritas gamma - ray observations extend from 0.5 to 500 gev .",
    "this full range , when corrected for ebl absorption at @xmath6 , is not well fit with a power law ( dashed blue line ) , while a curved log parabola provides an improved fit ( dotted blue line ) .",
    "we note than neither the power - law nor the log - parabolic fit represents the data well .",
    "the fit results for each ebl model are summarized in table  2 .",
    "both the power - law and log - parabolic fits find indices of @xmath61 , with a significantly curved log - parabolic fit .",
    "notably , the highest energy veritas point at 500 gev appears to deviate from the fits , matching the lat extrapolated power - law ( red dashed line ) .",
    "this deviation is not expected by standard blazar emission models , but is only about two standard deviations at the redshift lower limit .",
    "a break between the lat and veritas absorption - corrected data is apparent .",
    "this discrepancy is not likely an issue of instrumental cross - calibration , as agreement between veritas and lat observations have been found for other contemporaneous blazar observations ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". a portion of this feature may be due to a small level of undetected variability .",
    "although short intervals of variability are difficult to rule out , no long - term variability is detected @xcite , making it unlikely that the spectral feature between the lat and veritas instruments is due to variability alone .",
    "since @xmath6 is a lower limit , it is conceivable that the discontinuity between the lat and veritas data may , in fact , be an unphysical effect arising from the incomplete correction for absorption by the ebl .",
    "the first differential flux point of the vhe spectrum at 150 gev can not be made to match the lat extrapolated spectrum without deabsorbing the flux for a redshift of 1.2 ( blue stars in figure  3 ) .",
    "this deabsorbed spectrum is shown for the @xcite model , but is representative of the required distances of @xmath62 and @xmath63 when corrected with the @xcite and @xcite models , respectively .",
    "the @xmath64 corrected vhe spectrum results in a _ rising _ slope , i.e. with an index @xmath65 when fit with a differential power law .",
    "a vhe spectrum with a rising power law is difficult to produce in even the most extreme emission scenarios .",
    "although this redshift value is still in agreement with the redshift upper limit set by @xcite , we interpret the unphysical vhe spectrum as evidence that the blazar does not reside at this distance .      assuming that the blazar resides near @xmath6 , the apparent discontinuity between the lat and veritas energy ranges may be due to gamma - ray absorption in the vicinity of the blazar . it has been shown that absorption of gamma - rays by a broad line region ( blr ) can produce broken power - law spectra in bright lat - detected blazars @xcite . however ,",
    "this type of absorption is not immediately expected for an intermediate / high - synchrotron - peaked source such as pks1424 + 240 , expected to exhibit a clean radiation environment @xcite .    the absorption - corrected vhe point at 500 gev matches the lat power - law extrapolation , with a distinct mismatch to the 100 through 400 gev points .",
    "a source of gamma - ray opacity that is only sensitive to photons between 100 gev and @xmath66400 gev is difficult to explain with an ion continuum such as that present in a blr .",
    "it has been shown that the optical depth of a blr containing uv - continuum and ionization lines produces a constant optical depth from tens of gev to beyond 30 tev @xcite . since pks1424 + 240",
    "is not expected to harbor a blr , it is perhaps more likely that the ebl model is slightly overcorrecting for the photon absorption around 500 gev . the observed hard spectrum",
    "might also be explained by secondary gamma rays produced in cosmic - ray interactions along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "we present the strict redshift lower limit of @xmath0 for pks1424 + 240 , set by the detection of ly@xmath2 and @xmath3 lines from intervening hydrogen clouds .",
    "this lower limit makes pks1424 + 240 the most distant vhe - detected source . at this distance , vhe observations of the source out to energies of 500 gev probe gamma - ray opacities of up to @xmath675 .",
    "an investigation of possible constraint on the opacity of the ebl shows that the absorption - corrected power - law fits do not lie significantly outside of the standard spectral limitations",
    ". however , deabsorption with the @xcite model produces the hardest intrinsic vhe spectrum .",
    "if the blazar resides at a redshift beyond the lower limit , the deabsorbed indices may become constraining to even the lowest level ebl model .",
    "this redshift information allows the investigation of the ebl absorption - corrected gamma - ray emission . correcting the vhe spectrum for the minimum redshift of @xmath6 shows an unexpected spectral shape . the elevated flux around 500 gev , while not high significance",
    ", may be due to an overcorrection of absorption by the ebl model .",
    "this feature is still present when using the @xcite model ( open circles in figure  3 ) , which predicts a low ebl density and therefore might be evidence for a pair - production anomaly , such as might occur if vhe photons mixed with axion - like particles .",
    "the spectral feature occurring between the lat and veritas energy bands can not be reasonably removed by correcting for additional absorption due to a larger distance . instead , deabsorption for a higher redshift to match the lat and veritas fluxes results in a non - physical spectrum and an extreme distance of @xmath64 .",
    "it is possible , although unlikely , that the ebl absorption - corrected gamma - ray spectrum of pks1424 + 240 is exhibiting gamma - ray absorption within an intrinsic photon field such as a blr . as the most distant vhe bl lac object , probing historically high values of gamma - ray opacity , this source requires additional gamma ray observations and a tighter constraint on the redshift to further investigate the intrinsic emission .",
