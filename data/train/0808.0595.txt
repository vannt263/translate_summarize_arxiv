    "there has been a recent surge of studies of electromagnetic waves ( emws ) propagating in artificially fabricated media ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) , including metals with modulated properties  @xcite , arrays of coupled waveguides  @xcite , left - hand materials  @xcite , and layered superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the excitation of these waves can produce a large variety of resonance anomalies  @xcite in the reflectivity , transmissivity , and absorptivity , offering new types of optical nano - devices .",
    "the recent increase of these type of studies is related to nonlinear surface and waveguide em modes ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . in this broad context ,",
    "a layered superconductor is a medium favoring the propagation of nonlinear  @xcite and surface  @xcite waves in the ( important for applications  @xcite ) terahertz ( thz ) and sub - thz frequency ranges .",
    "both the existence of surface waves  @xcite and the nonlinear effects  @xcite occur due to the gap structure  ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) of the spectrum of josephson plasma waves , which was experimentally observed via josephson plasma resonance  @xcite . the nonlinearity of josephson plasma waves with frequency @xmath3 close to the josephson plasma frequency @xmath4 becomes important even at small field amplitudes @xmath5 .",
    "in close analogy to nonlinear optics  @xcite , the nonlinear jpws exhibit numerous remarkable features  @xcite , including the slowing down of light , self - focusing effects , and the pumping of weaker waves by stronger ones . however , the nonlinearity of emws in layered superconductors is quite different from optical nonlinearities .",
    "this leads one to expect very unusual phenomena in the emw propagation in this nonlinear media .    in this paper ,",
    "we predict and analyze theoretically one of such unexpected nonlinear effects in a thin slab of a layered superconductor subject to an externally applied electromagnetic wave .",
    "we show that , under specific conditions , the amplitude dependence of the phase @xmath1 of the reflected wave becomes many - valued .",
    "this should result in hysteretic jumps of @xmath1 when sweeping the amplitude of the incident wave , a phenomenon which is very unusual for conductors and superconductors .",
    "consider a slab of a layered superconductor of thickness @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the crystallographic * ab*-plane coincides with the @xmath7-plane and the * c*-axis is along the @xmath8-axis .",
    "the interlayer distance @xmath9 is much smaller than the thickness @xmath6 of the slab .",

    "therefore , the magnetic @xmath12 and electric @xmath13 fields satisfy the symmetry conditions , @xmath14 @xmath15 due to this symmetry , we will only consider the field distribution in the upper half - space @xmath16 .    the electromagnetic field in the vacuum , @xmath17 , is the sum of the incident and",
    "specularly reflected waves .",
    "the maxwell equations give for them , @xmath18 with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the wave frequency , @xmath22 is the speed of light , and @xmath23 is the angle of incidence .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is the _ phase shift of the reflected wave _ at the boundary @xmath24 of the slab .",
    "as is known , @xmath1 defines the _ surface reactance _ @xmath25 of a sample : when neglecting the dissipation , @xmath26 inside a layered superconductor , the electromagnetic field is determined by the interlayer gauge - invariant phase difference @xmath27 of the order parameter .",
    "the spatial distribution of @xmath28 obeys the set of coupled sine - gordon equations ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "we consider the nonlinear jpws with @xmath29 , when the josephson current @xmath30 can be approximated by @xmath31 .",
    "we also assume that the gauge - invariant phase difference experiences small changes on the scale @xmath9 in the @xmath8-direction , and thus we can use the continuum approach . in the continuum limit , the coupled sine - gordon equation has the form , @xmath32 here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the london penetration depths across and along layers , respectively , and @xmath35 is the josephson plasma frequency .",
    "the latter is determined by the maximum josephson current @xmath36 , the interlayer dielectric constant @xmath37 , and the interlayer spacing @xmath9 .",
    "the spatial variations in the @xmath8-direction of the fields inside the very thin superconducting layers are neglected .",
    "here we also omit the dissipation terms related to the quasiparticle conductivity .",
    "they are controlled by the sample temperature @xmath38 and can be reduced to negligibly small values . moreover , in eq .",

    "( [ solution ] ) ) , while @xmath69 is its derivative with respect to the dimensionless coordinate @xmath70 .",
    "the paths along the arrows on the phase trajectories between solid circles correspond to the change of the coordinate @xmath8 inside the sample , from @xmath71 to @xmath24 .",
    "open circles correspond to the middle of the slab ( @xmath11).,width=661 ]    thus the electromagnetic fields in the vacuum and in the superconducting slab are determined by eqs .",

    "thus , separating terms with @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we derive four equations for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath1 , and @xmath77 : @xmath78 here @xmath79 @xmath80 is the value of @xmath66 at the interface @xmath24 . note that , without any loss of generality , we can assume the value @xmath81 of the total magnetic field at the sample surface to be positive , @xmath82 .",

    "( [ efh ] ) and ( [ sol - xi ] ) , give , in an implicit form , the required dependence of the phase shift @xmath1 on the amplitude of the incident wave @xmath0 .",
    "for further analysis of the amplitude dependence of the phase shift @xmath1 , it is very important to take into account the non - single - valued relation between the values @xmath81 and @xmath87 .",
    "indeed , eq .  ( [ efh ] ) and fig .  [ fig9 ]",
    "show that there exist _ three values _ of @xmath68 that correspond to the _ same value _ of @xmath88 , if @xmath89 .",
    "taking into account eq .",
    "( [ ab4 ] ) , we conclude that three different values of the parameter @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ ab5 ] ) correspond to the same value of @xmath91 .",
    "this results in the appearance of _ three branches _ of the dependence @xmath92 .     versus the normalized amplitude @xmath68 of the gauge - invariant phase @xmath93 .",
    "this @xmath94 dependence is described by eq .",

    "( [ sol - xi ] ) is significantly simplified , @xmath97 and one can easily derive the asymptotic equations for all three branches @xmath92 .",
    "first , we discuss the branch of the dependence @xmath92 that corresponds to the portion `` 12 '' of the @xmath94 curve in fig .",
    "this monotonically increasing branch is shown by the blue curve ( with number 1 ) in the main panel of fig .  4 , and also in inset ( a ) of fig .",
    "this blue branch is defined within the interval @xmath98 of the @xmath91 change .",
    "the ending point @xmath99 of the branch is described by the expression , @xmath100 at this point , @xmath101     of the reflected wave on the dimensionless amplitude @xmath91 of the incident electromagnetic wave .",
    "the values of the parameters here are : @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 . the insets show magnified portions of the @xmath92 plots .",
    "the arrows on the curves indicate how the phase shift @xmath1 changes when periodically varying the amplitude @xmath91 .",
    "the first jump in @xmath92 at @xmath106 is shown by the downwards vertical arrow in the inset ( b ) .",
    "this produces a jump @xmath107",
    ". the second ( reverse ) jump at @xmath108 is shown in the main frame and in the inst ( c ) .",
    "namely , the upward vertical arrow ( from @xmath109 , to @xmath110 ) shows the jump in @xmath92.,width=642 ]    the low - amplitude asymptotics of @xmath111 dependence is , @xmath112      the second and third branches of the @xmath92 dependence correspond to the portions `` 23 '' and `` 45 '' , respectively , of the @xmath94 curve in fig .",
    "the second and third branches of @xmath92 are shown by the green and red curves ( indicated by numbers 2 and 3 , respectively ) in fig .",
    "the second branch exists in the interval @xmath113 as is seen in fig .  4",
    ", the first and second branches of @xmath92 almost meet at the point @xmath99 .",
    "the third branch is defined for @xmath114    near the minimum value of @xmath91 , i.e. , for @xmath115 , the second and third branches have the asymptotics , @xmath116 here , the signs `` + '' and `` @xmath117 '' correspond to the second and third branches , respectively .",
    "the third branch tends to zero for @xmath118 following the expression , @xmath119    now we present the parametrically - defined formula for all three branches , which is valid for @xmath91 not very close to @xmath99 :    [ chih0param ] @xmath120    figure  5 demonstrates the very good agreement of this formula with numerical results .     of the reflected wave versus the dimensionless amplitude @xmath91 of the incident wave , for @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath121 , and @xmath105 .",

    "( [ efh ] ) , ( [ sol - xi ] ) , ( [ ab4 ] ) , and ( [ ab5]).,width=642 ]      from the analysis shown above , we can now describe the behavior of the phase shift @xmath1 of the reflected wave when periodically changing the amplitude @xmath91 of the incident wave .",
    "when increasing @xmath91 from zero , the phase shift @xmath111 increases monotonically following the first branch in fig .  4 .",
    "at the point @xmath122 , the first branch comes to the end , and a jump to the third branch should occur when further increasing @xmath91 .",
    "the phase shift @xmath111 jumps from the value @xmath123 to the final value @xmath124 thus , the jump here is @xmath125    when decreasing @xmath91 , the phase shift @xmath111 decreases following the third branch , crosses the point @xmath122 , and only at the point @xmath126 it performs a reverse jump to the first branch .",
    "therefore , now @xmath127    thus , the hysteretic jumps @xmath128 of the phase @xmath129 of the reflected wave could be observed when periodically changing the amplitude @xmath91 of the incident wave .",
    "in this paper , we have predicted and theoretically analyzed unusual phenomenon for conducting media .",
    "we have shown that , due to the specific nonlinearity of layered superconductors , _",
    "hysteretic jumps of the surface reactance _ could be observed when periodically changing the amplitude @xmath0 of the incident wave .",
    "a remarkable feature of the predicted phenomenon is the _ relatively small values of the necessary ac amplitudes _",
    "the hysteretic jumps can be observed _ even when _ @xmath130 . according to our analysis , the critical amplitude @xmath131",
