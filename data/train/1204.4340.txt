    "light , massive scalars are a generic prediction of the low - energy limit of many theoretical attempts to unify gravity with the standard model of particle physics . for example , string theory suggests the existence of light scalars ( `` axions '' ) with masses @xmath0 that could be as small as the hubble scale ( @xmath8  ev ) . for a coherent scalar field to be cosmologically distinct from cold dark matter , or to play a quintessence - like role , it must be very light : @xmath9 . in this `` string axiverse '' scenario , cosmic microwave background observations , galaxy surveys and",
    "even astrophysical measurements of black hole spins may offer exciting experimental opportunities to set constraints on the masses and couplings of the scalar fields @xcite .",
    "therefore , astrophysical and cosmological observations may provide important clues on the relation between gravity and the other forces .    in this paper ,",
    "building on previous work @xcite , we explore the possibility of constraining the mass and coupling of a scalar field via gravitational - wave observations of compact binary inspirals with earth - based or space - based interferometers , such as advanced ligo / virgo @xcite , the einstein telescope @xcite , elisa / ngo @xcite or classic lisa @xcite . until recently , calculations of gravitational radiation in scalar - tensor theories focused on massless scalar fields ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath10 , deviations from general relativity can be parametrized in terms of a single coupling constant , that for historical reasons is usually chosen to be the brans - dicke parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the best constraint on this parameter to date ( @xmath11 ) comes from cassini measurements of the shapiro time delay @xcite .",
    "for massless scalar - tensor theories , gravitational - wave observations of mixed binaries can provide constraints comparable to ( or marginally better than ) the cassini bound @xcite .",
    "recent studies explored some of the implications that light , massive scalar fields may have in the context of gravitational - wave phenomenology . for example , resonant superradiant effects induced by light massive scalars may produce `` floating orbits '' when small compact objects spiral into rotating black holes , leaving a distinct signature in gravitational waves @xcite .",

    "we consider a scalar - tensor theory with a constant coupling function @xmath15 and a mass term , as in @xcite .",
    "expanding the potential @xmath16 about a ( cosmologically determined ) background value of the scalar field @xmath17 , under the assumption of asymptotic flatness , we have @xmath18 then the equation of motion for the scalar field has the schematic form @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 we note that for @xmath10 this theory reduces to the well - known brans - dicke theory @xcite .    throughout the paper we use geometrical units @xmath21 , so all quantities can be expressed in ( say ) seconds : for example , the mass of the sun @xmath22  s. we assume a standard @xmath23cdm cosmological model with @xmath24  kms@xmath25mpc@xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "given the scalar field mass @xmath28 ( in ev ) , we find it convenient to define a quantity @xmath29 with dimensions of inverse length ( or inverse time , since @xmath30 ) , as this is the quantity that would appear in the flat - space klein - gordon equation @xmath31 . to convert between @xmath28 and @xmath0 ,",

    "we will use @xmath28 and @xmath0 interchangeably in the rest of the paper ; the units should be clear from the context .",
    "our study is the first to explore bounds on massive scalar tensor theories using gravitational - wave observations of compact binaries .",
    "we only consider quasicircular , nonspinning binaries for two reasons : ( 1 ) resonant effects in the context of gravitational - wave detection were considered in @xcite , and they would produce large enough dephasing to prevent detection using general relativistic templates ; ( 2 ) in the absence of resonant effects , the introduction of aligned spins would increase parameter measurement errors by about one order of magnitude .",
    "however , spin precession and eccentricity would reduce the errors by a comparable amount @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , our bounds for quasicircular , nonspinning binaries should be comparable to bounds resulting from more realistic ( and complex ) waveform models , as long as resonant effects do nt play a role .    in this paper we will focus on quasicircular neutron star - black hole binaries .",
    "the main reason is that , according to our previous investigation @xcite , only _ mixed binaries _",
    "( i.e. , binaries whose members have different gravitational binding energies ) can produce significant amounts of scalar gravitational radiation . under the assumption of asymptotic flatness , dipole radiation is produced due to violations of the strong equivalence principle when the binary members have unequal `` sensitivities '' : @xmath33 .",
    "the sensitivities are related to the gravitational binding energies of each binary member ( labeled by @xmath34 ) : @xmath35 for a schwarzschild black hole , @xmath36 for a neutron star , and @xmath37 for a white dwarf @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , dipole radiation is produced when the system s center of mass is offset with respect to the center of inertia , so mixed and eccentric binaries are the best observational targets to constrain scalar - tensor theories . a second reason to consider neutron star - black hole binaries",
    "is that dipolar radiation should not be emitted in black hole - black hole systems because of the no - hair theorem , i.e. the fact that black hole solutions in scalar - tensor theories are the same as in gr ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , building on earlier work by jacobson @xcite , horbatsch and burgess pointed out that scalar fields that vary on cosmological timescales may violate the no - hair theorem , so that even black hole - black hole binaries may produce dipolar radiation @xcite .",
    "the existence of dipolar radiation in extended theories of gravity and the investigation of possible bounds on dipolar radiation are active research topics @xcite .    in summary",
    ", here we will make the conservative assumption that only mixed binaries generate dipolar radiation , and we will investigate bounds on the mass and coupling of the scalar field coming from gravitational - wave observations of black hole - neutron star binaries . for simplicity we will set the mass of the neutron star to be @xmath38 , and we will focus on nonrotating black holes .",
    "this rules out by construction the possibility of floating orbits of the kind studied in @xcite .",

    "( 4.7 ) of @xcite ( `` adligo zdhp '' ) . in both cases",

    "( [ definitions ] ) below for a more precise definition ) .",
    "matched - filtering detection of gravitational radiation from compact binaries relies primarily on an accurate knowledge of the wave phasing . in any theory that differs from general relativity",
    ", the gravitational - wave phasing will be modified by a slight amount that depends on the parameters of the theory . in massless scalar - tensor theories the dominant ( dipolar ) contribution scales like @xmath40 .",
    "if we measure a waveform consistent with general relativity we can set upper bounds on deviations of the dipolar term from zero , and therefore we can set lower limits on @xmath1 @xcite . by computing the gravitational - wave phase in the stationary - phase approximation ( spa ; cf .",
    "( [ spafeta2 ] ) below ) we will see that the scalar mass always contributes to the phase in the combination @xmath41 , so that gravitational - wave observations of nonspinning , quasicircular inspirals can only set upper limits on @xmath2 . for large signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath3 ,",
    "the constraint is inversely proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "it is useful to plot constraints that result from observations with snr @xmath42 : this corresponds to a minimal threshold for detection of the corresponding binary system , and in this sense it places an upper limit on the achievable bounds on @xmath0 ( and a lower limit on the achievable bounds on @xmath1 ) .     with adligo , adligo zdhp , et , classic lisa and elisa / ngo at fixed snr @xmath42.,width=321 ]    in fig .",

    "a gravitational - wave observation would exclude the complement of a trapezoidal region on the top left of the plot .",
    "we see that bounds from space - based gravitational - wave observations will improve over the cassini , lunar laser ranging and binary pulsar bounds bound only for neutron star - black hole systems with @xmath50 . in a sense , these predictions are conservative : for example , for a gravitational - wave observation with snr @xmath53 both bounds ( the horizontal and diagonal lines ) would improve by an order of magnitude",
    ". therefore , a single high - snr observation ( or the statistical combination of several observations , see e.g. @xcite ) may yield bounds on massive scalar - tensor theories that are significantly better than solar system or binary pulsar bounds .",

    "the parametrized post - einsteinian framework relies on identifying a leading - order correction to a general relativistic waveform .",
