    "in this paper , we consider the problem of estimating the continuous part of the quadratic variation ( henceforth referred to as integrated volatility ) of a discretely - observed one - dimensional it semimartingale over a finite interval with mesh of the observation grid going to zero in the case when the observed process can contain jumps of infinite variation .",
    "separating jumps from diffusive volatility is of central interest in finance due to the distinct role played by diffusive volatility and jumps in financial decision making , which is also reflected in the distinct risk premium demanded by investors for each of them ; see , for example , @xcite . until now",
    ", this problem has been well studied when jumps are of finite variation ; see , for example , @xcite . however ,",
    "empirical results in @xcite suggest that for some financial data sets jumps can be of infinite variation .",
    "this is the case we study in this paper .",
    "in particular , we consider a one - dimensional it semimartingale @xmath0 which is defined on some probability space @xmath1 and can always be represented as @xmath2 \\\\[-8pt ] & & { } + \\int_0^t\\int_{\\mathbb{r}}\\delta(s , z ) 1_{\\{|\\delta(s , z)|>1\\ } } { p\\!\\!\\!\\!{}_{_=}\\!\\,}(ds , dz ) , \\nonumber \\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a standard brownian motion and @xmath4 a poisson random measure on @xmath5 with compensator ( intensity measure ) @xmath6 .",
    "this is the grigelionis representation , and the specific choice of the poisson measure @xmath4 is in no way a restriction ( see , e.g. , theorem  2.1.2 in @xcite ) . here ,",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are progressively measurable processes and @xmath9 is a predictable function on @xmath10 , with appropriate integrability assumptions .",
    "the process @xmath0 is observed at regularly spaced times @xmath11 for @xmath12 , within a finite time interval @xmath13 $ ] , and without microstructure noise .",
    "our goal is to estimate , on the basis of these observations , the so - called integrated volatility , that is , @xmath14 for @xmath15 or more generally for all @xmath16 $ ] , with the rate @xmath17 , when @xmath0 contains jumps of infinite variation .    when jumps are absent ,",
    "that is , when @xmath18 [ so the last two terms in ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) disappear ] , the best estimator of @xmath19 is the _ realized volatility _ , or _ approximate quadratic variation _ : @xmath20 } \\bigl({\\delta}^n_ix \\bigr)^2\\qquad\\mbox{where } { \\delta}^n_ix = x_{i{\\delta}_n}-x_{(i-1){\\delta}_n}.\\ ] ] under very weak assumptions on @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( namely when @xmath21 and @xmath22 are finite for all @xmath23 ) , we have a central limit theorem ( clt ) with rate @xmath24 : the processes @xmath25 converge in the sense of stable convergence in law for processes , to a limit @xmath26 which is defined on an extension of the space , and which conditionally on @xmath27 is a centered gaussian martingale whose conditional law is characterized by its ( conditional ) variance @xmath28 or equivalently , we have @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a brownian motion independent of @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath31 is a constant , or more generally when @xmath32 for a smooth enough function @xmath8 on @xmath5 , the estimators @xmath33 are _ efficient _ for any fixed time @xmath23 , because in this case we have the lan or lamn property and @xmath34 above is the inverse of the @xmath27-conditional fisher information , normalized by @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , in the general case ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) with @xmath18 we qualify the estimator @xmath33 as being _",
    "when jumps are present , so far there are essentially two types of results , hinging on a specification of the so - called _ degree of jump activity_. to keep things simple in this , and although substantial extensions can be made , we will suppose that for some @xmath36 $ ] , @xmath37 \\\\[-8pt ] \\eqntext{\\mbox{where $ j$ is a lebesgue - integrable function on $ { \\mathbb{r}}$}.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the smaller @xmath38 above is , the stronger the assumption is , and it is ( slightly ) stronger than assuming @xmath39 for all @xmath23 , where @xmath40 is the size of the jump at time @xmath41 .",
    "when ( [ 1 - 5 ] ) holds with @xmath42 , the jumps have finite activity ; when ( [ 1 - 5 ] ) holds with @xmath43 , the jumps are ( locally ) summable .",
    "in the latter case , we can rewrite ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) ( up to modifying @xmath44 ) as @xmath45 the supremum of all @xmath38 for which ( [ 1 - 5 ] ) holds is the degree of jump activity , or blumenthal  getoor index .",
    "then we have two cases :    _ when @xmath46_. in this case , we have two major types of volatility estimators that enjoy a feasible clt .",
    "the first is the _ truncated realized volatility _",
    "@xcite ) @xmath47 } \\bigl({\\delta}^n_ix \\bigr)^2 1_{\\ {    { \\delta}_n^{\\varpi}\\ ] ] [ the last statement means that @xmath48 for some @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 has exactly the same limiting properties as @xmath51 does in the continuous case provided ( [ 1 - 5 ] ) holds with some @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the second type of jump - robust volatility estimators are the _ multipower variations _",
    "@xcite ) , which we do not explicitly recall here .",
    "these estimators also satisfy a clt with rate @xmath24 , but with a conditional variance bigger than in ( [ 1 - 4 ] ) ( so they are rate - efficient but not variance - efficient ) .",
    "_ when @xmath54_. in this case , the above two types of estimators are still consistent , but when centered around @xmath19 and appropriately scaled , they are only bounded in probability with no clt in general and rate of convergence that is much slower than @xmath55 . for example , when @xmath54 , the sequence @xmath56 is bounded in probability ( when @xmath43 , the multipower variations enjoy a clt with a bias term , see @xcite ) .    on a more general level , we have the following general result from @xcite : if we have estimators @xmath57 such that , for some sequence @xmath58 of numbers , the variables @xmath59 are bounded in probability in @xmath60 and also when @xmath0 ranges through all semimartingales of type ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) satisfying ( [ 1 - 5 ] ) with a fixed function @xmath61 and also @xmath62 for some constant @xmath63 ( so @xmath64 is a kind of `` minimax '' rate ) , we necessarily have for some constant @xmath65 : @xmath66    in this paper , we exhibit new estimators for @xmath19 which converge with rate @xmath24 , and which are even variance - efficient in the sense that they satisfy the same clt as @xmath33 does in the continuous case , when @xmath38 defined in ( [ 1 - 5 ] ) above , that is , the jump activity , is bigger than @xmath67 . of course , given the result in @xcite , discussed in point ( 2 ) above , this is only possible under some additional assumption , namely that the `` small '' jumps behave like those of a stable process , or of the integral with respect to a stable - like process , with some index @xmath68 [ recall that in this case ( [ 1 - 5 ] ) holds for all @xmath69 , but not for @xmath70 .",
    "hence , here we are working in a kind of semiparametric setting , with the ( unknown ) parameter @xmath71 .",
    "we should point out that this `` semiparametric '' setting is still quite general and covers many jump models used in empirical applications , particularly those in finance .",
    "similar assumptions about the jumps have been also made when estimating the blumenthal ",
    "getoor index of jump activity in @xcite and @xcite among others .",
    "the estimation method proposed in the current paper is based on estimating locally the volatility ( diffusion coefficient ) from the empirical characteristic function of the increments of the process over blocks of decreasing length but containing an increasing number of observations , and then summing the local volatility estimates .",
    "the separation of volatility from jumps in our method is due to the dominant role of the diffusion component of @xmath0 in ( the real part of ) the characteristic function of the high frequency increments of the process for values of the argument that are going to infinity at the rate @xmath17 , or at a slightly slower rate .",
    "when infinite variation jumps are present , the proposed volatility estimators contain a bias which determines their rate of convergence .",
    "the bias scales differently for different values of the argument of the empirical characteristic function , used in forming our nonparametric volatility estimators , and we use this property to debias our initial volatility estimators .",
    "the debiased volatility estimators achieve the efficient rate of convergence and some of them reach the same ( efficient ) asymptotic variance as in ( [ 1 - 4 ] ) .    the empirical characteristic function of high - frequency increments has been previously used in nonparametric estimation of the empirical laplace transform of volatility in @xcite as well as in @xcite for estimation of the empirical laplace transform of the stochastic scale for pure - jump semimartingales .",
    "there are two major differences between these papers and our study .",
    "first , we are interested in estimating the integrated volatility while the above cited papers consider estimation of the empirical laplace transform of the stochastic volatility .",
    "second , and more importantly , @xcite consider jump - diffusion setting with jumps of finite variation only and @xcite consider pure - jump semimartingales ( i.e. , processes with no diffusion ) .",
    "our main contribution is rate and variance efficient estimators of integrated volatility in jump - diffusion setting with jumps of infinite variation .",
    "finally , the empirical characteristic function in low frequency setting has been used in @xcite and @xcite for estimating the diffusion coefficient of a lvy process , in @xcite for nonparametric estimation for a lvy process which is a sum of a drift , a symmetric stable process and a compound poisson process , as well as in @xcite and @xcite for estimation of lvy density and jump activity in affine models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec - set ]",
    ", we present the setting and state our assumptions . in section",
    "[ sec - fe ] , we propose our initial estimators of integrated volatility and derive a clt for them when a bias due to the infinite variation jumps is removed from the estimators . in section  [ sec - ef ] , we propose a way to estimate this bias and derive a feasible clt for our debiased estimators .",
    "section  [ sec - mc ] contains a monte carlo study .",
    "proofs are given in section  [ sec - pfe ] .",
    "as mentioned before , the underlying process @xmath0 is a one - dimensional it semimartingale on the space @xmath1 , and observed without noise at the times @xmath11 : @xmath12 .",
    "we restrict the general form ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) by assuming that the jumps are a mixture of ( essentially unspecified ) jumps with finite variation , plus the jumps of a stochastic integral with respect to a lvy process whose small jumps are `` stable - like . ''    we have two versions , the simplest one being as follows : @xmath72 with @xmath73 a symmetric pure jump lvy process with blumenthal ",
    "getoor index @xmath74 and the last integral being with finite variation ( the precise assumptions are given below ) . in this version , the jumps due to @xmath73 are `` symmetric '' in the sense that @xmath75 and @xmath76 have the same law , as processes . to deal with the nonsymmetric case",
    ", one could use a process @xmath73 which is nonsymmetric .",
    "however , it is more convenient and also more general to use the following version : @xmath77 \\\\[-8pt ] & & { } + \\int_0^t\\int_{\\mathbb{r}}\\delta(s , z ) { p\\!\\!\\!\\!{}_{_=}\\!\\,}(ds , dz)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath78 and @xmath79 two independent lvy processes with the same index @xmath71 and positive jumps",
    ".    we will also require the volatility @xmath80 to be an it semimartingale , and it can thus be represented as @xmath81 most volatility models used in empirical applications satisfy ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) , in particular , models in the popular affine class .",
    "as is well known , the jumps of @xmath80 can , without restriction , be driven by the same poisson measure @xmath4 as @xmath0 , but we need a second brownian motion @xmath82 : in the case of `` pure leverage , '' we would have @xmath83 and @xmath82 is not needed ; in the case of `` no leverage , '' we rather have @xmath84 and in the mixed case we need both @xmath3 and  @xmath82 .",
    "note that ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) is a special case of ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) : indeed , if @xmath73 is a pure jump symmetric lvy process , it can always be written as @xmath85 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 being independent identically distributed and with positive jumps , so ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) with @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the same as ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) with @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , we only give the assumptions for ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) .",
    "the first assumption is a structural assumption describing the driving terms @xmath89 , the second one being a set of conditions on the coefficients implying in particular the existence of the various stochastic integrals involved above .",
    "both assumptions involve a number @xmath38 in @xmath90 ( the same in both ) and , the smaller @xmath38 is , the stronger the two assumptions are .",

    "moreover , there is a number @xmath96 such that the tail functions @xmath97 satisfy @xmath98 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad \\biggl|{\\overline{f}{}}^{\\pm}(x)- \\frac{1}{x^{{\\beta } } } \\biggr|\\leq g(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is a decreasing function such that @xmath100 .",
    "[ ass(b ) ] we have a sequence @xmath101 of stopping times increasing to infinity , a sequence @xmath102 of numbers , and a nonnegative lebesgue - integrable function @xmath61 on @xmath103 , such that the processes @xmath104 are cdlg adapted , the coefficients @xmath105 are predictable , the processes @xmath106 are progressively measurable , and @xmath107 \\\\[-4pt ] & \\hspace*{13pt}v = b , h^{\\sigma},\\gamma^{+},\\gamma^{-}\\hspace*{241pt}&\\nonumber \\\\ & \\hspace*{13pt}\\qquad\\quad\\rightarrow\\quad\\bigl |{\\mathbb{e}}(v_{(t+s)\\wedge\\tau_n}-v_{t\\wedge\\tau_n}\\mid{\\mathcal{f}}_t)\\bigr |+ { \\mathbb{e}}\\bigl(\\bigl |v_{(t+s)\\wedge\\tau_n}-v_{t\\wedge\\tau_n}\\bigr |^2\\mid{\\mathcal{f}}_t \\bigr)\\leq a_ns . & \\nonumber \\ ] ]    note that we do _ not _ require the processes @xmath92 to be independent from the measure @xmath4 , thus allowing any kind of dependence between the jumps of @xmath0 and those of @xmath108 .",
    "intuitively , the number @xmath38 in assumptions  [ ass(a ) ] and  [ ass(b ) ] control the activity of the finite jump variation component of @xmath0 as well as the degree of deviation from the stable process of @xmath92 which drive the infinite jump variation component of @xmath0 .",
    "our condition in ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) is similar to condition an1 on the lvy measure around zero in @xcite",
    ". assumptions",
    "[ ass(a ) ] and  [ ass(b ) ] are satisfied by many parametric models for the jump component used in applications as illustrated by the following example .",

    "a popular parametric example for @xmath111 is that of a tempered stable process with corresponding lvy density of the form @xmath114 in this case , it is not hard to show ( using theorem  2.1.2 of @xcite which links integrals of random functions with respect to poisson measure and random integer - valued measures ) that assumptions  [ ass(a ) ] and  [ ass(b ) ] ( regarding the jump part of @xmath0 ) hold with @xmath115 in assumption  [ ass(a ) ] being the corresponding parameter in the above parametric model when @xmath116 and further @xmath117 for @xmath118 arbitrary small and @xmath119 and @xmath120 [ and nonzero @xmath121 in ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) which depends on @xmath92 ] .",
    "when @xmath123 in the above parametric model , assumptions  [ ass(a ) ] and  [ ass(b ) ] hold trivially with @xmath124 .",
    "we end this section with a few comments :    in ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) , there is an implicit standardization of the processes @xmath92 .",

    "however , in this case the processes @xmath127 satisfy ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) as stated , and ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) holds with @xmath128 and @xmath129 as well .",
    "it is more convenient in the sequel , and not a restriction , to use the standardized form ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) .    by assumption",
    "[ ass(b ) ] and the fact that @xmath130 , the last integral in ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) defines a process with finite variation which is the sum of its jumps . on the other hand",

    ", the last part of ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) could be somewhat weakened ( e.g. , we could drop it in the case of @xmath136 ) , but at the expense of a nontrivial complication of the proofs .",
    "since these are satisfied in virtually all models used in practice , we decided to impose these assumptions here .",
    "note also that this last part of ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) is satisfied as soon as the processes @xmath137 are themselves it semimartingales with locally bounded characteristics .",
