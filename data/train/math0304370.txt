    "-5 mm    in @xcite , the author showed that long - range intersection probabilities for random walks , brownian motion paths and wiener sausages in euclidean space , can be estimated up to constant factors by survival probabilities of percolation processes on trees .",
    "more recently , several long - standing problems involving cover times and `` thick points '' for random walks in two dimensions were solved in joint works @xcite of a. dembo , j. rosen , o. zeitouni and the author .",
    "these solutions were motivated by powerful analogies with corresponding problems on trees , but these analogies were not discussed explicitly in the research papers cited . the goal of the present note is to describe the tree problems and solutions , that correspond to the problems studied in @xcite .",
    "the _ cover time _ for a random walk on a finite graph is the number of steps it takes the random walk to visit all vertices .",
    "the cover time has been studied intensively by probabilists , combinatorialists , statistical physicists and computer scientists , with a variety of motivations ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the problem of determining the expected cover time @xmath1 for the @xmath0 by @xmath0 lattice torus @xmath2 , was posed by wilf  @xcite and aldous  @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we proved the following conjecture of aldous  @xcite .",
    "[ theo-2lattice ] if @xmath1 denotes the time it takes for the simple random walk in @xmath2 to completely cover @xmath2 , then @xmath3    the first step toward proving theorem [ theo-2lattice ] , was to find a sufficiently robust proof for the asymptotics of the cover time of finite @xmath4-ary trees .",
    "these asymptotics were originally determined by aldous in @xcite , but his elegant recursive method was quite sensitive and did not adapt to the approximate tree structure that can be found in euclidean space .",
    "cover times on trees are discussed in the next section .    turning to a different but related topic ,",
    "erds and taylor ( 1960 ) posed a problem about simple random walks in @xmath5 : _ how many times does the walk revisit the most frequently visited site in the first @xmath0 steps ? _    [ etlattice ] denote by @xmath6 the number of visits of planar simple random walk to @xmath7 by time @xmath0 , and let @xmath8 then @xmath9    this was conjectured by erds and taylor  ( * ? ? ? * ( 3.11 ) ) .",
    "after d. aldous heard one of us describing this result , he pointed us to his cover time conjecture , and this eventually led to theorem [ theo-2lattice ] .",
    "although the proofs of that theorem and of theorem [ etlattice ] differ in important technical points , they follow the same basic pattern :    \\(i ) formulate a suitable tree - analog and find a `` robust '' proof .",
    "\\(ii ) establish a brownian version using excursion counts .",
    "\\(iii ) deduce the lattice result via strong approximation a - la @xcite .",
    "-5 mm    let @xmath10 denote the balanced @xmath4-ary tree of height @xmath11 , which has @xmath12 vertices , and @xmath13 edges .",
    "[ cover - bary ] denote by @xmath14 the time it takes for simple random walk in @xmath10 , started at the root , to cover @xmath10 .",
    "then @xmath15    * remark * the expected hitting time from one vertex to another is bounded by the commute time , which equals the effective resistance times twice the number of edges ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". therefore the expected hitting time between two vertices in @xmath10 is at most @xmath16 . from a general result in @xcite",
    ", it follows that also @xmath17    * proof of theorem [ cover - bary ] * denote by @xmath18 the time it takes the walk to cover and return to the root , and by @xmath19 the number of returns to the root until time @xmath18 . by the remark preceding the proof , @xmath20 ,",
    "so to prove the theorem it suffices to establish that @xmath21 the expected time to return to the root is the reciprocal of the root s stationary probability @xmath22 , so by wald s lemma @xmath23 thus the theorem reduces to showing @xmath24    we start by reproducing the straightforward proof of the upper bound .",
    "denote by @xmath25 the number of returns to the root of @xmath10 until the first visit to @xmath26 , and observe that @xmath19 is the maximum of @xmath25 over all leaves @xmath26 at level @xmath11 . at each visit to the root ,",
    "the chance to hit a specific leaf @xmath26 before returning to the root is @xmath27 , whence @xmath28 \\le ( 1- \\frac{1}{bk})^{rbk^2 } \\le e^{-rk } \\,.\\ ] ] summing over all leaves , we infer that @xmath29    \\le \\min\\{1 , b^k e^{-rk}\\ } \\,.\\ ] ] integrating over @xmath30 , @xmath31    \\le   bk^2(\\log b + 1/k ) \\,.\\ ] ] this yields the upper bound in ( [ eq : r ] ) . to prove a lower bound , aldous  @xcite uses a delicate recursion , and an embedded branching process argument . here",
    "we will give the shortest argument we know , which only involves an embedded branching process .",
    "given @xmath32 , our next goal is to show that @xmath33    \\to 1 \\mbox { \\rm as } k \\to \\infty \\,.\\ ] ] let @xmath34 be the number of steps until the root is visited @xmath35 times .",
    "fix @xmath36 , and choose @xmath37 large , depending on @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath26 be a vertex at level @xmath39 of @xmath10 , and suppose that @xmath40 is a descendant of @xmath26 at level @xmath41 .",
    "observe that the expected number of visits to @xmath26 by time @xmath34 is @xmath42 , and the expected number of excursions between @xmath26 and @xmath40 by time @xmath34 is @xmath43 .",
    "say that @xmath40 is `` special '' if the number of excursions from @xmath26 to @xmath40 by time @xmath34 is at most @xmath44 .",
    "note that vertices close to the root ( i.e. , at level @xmath41 where @xmath45 ) are special with high probability , because @xmath46 . if @xmath47 , then every visit to @xmath26 is equally likely to start an excursion to @xmath40 as to the ancestor of @xmath26 at distance @xmath37 from @xmath26 . thus , if @xmath26 is special then @xmath40 is special with probability at least @xmath48 $ ] , where @xmath49 has binomial law with parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 . by the central limit theorem , as @xmath52 grows , @xmath48 \\to \\p(z>(2r\\ell)^{1/2}]$ ] , where @xmath53 is standard normal . since @xmath54 , we find that @xmath55 > b^{-\\ell}$ ] , if @xmath37 is large enough .",
    "therefore , special vertices considered at jumps of @xmath56 levels ( to ensure the required independence ) dominate a supercritical branching process ; the survival probability tends to 1 as @xmath57 , because vertices near the root are almost guaranteed to be special .",
    "this establishes ( [ low ] ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath58 for large @xmath11 , and since @xmath59 is arbitrary , this completes the proof of ( [ eq : r ] ) and the theorem .",
    "* remark * the argument above is quite robust : it readily extends to family trees of galton watson trees with mean offspring @xmath60 . with a little more work ,",
    "using the notion of quasi - bernoulli percolation ( see @xcite or @xcite ) , it can be extended to the first @xmath11 levels of any tree @xmath61 that has growth and branching number both equal to @xmath60 .",
    "the most robust argument , the truncated second moment method used in @xcite , is too technical to include here .",
    "-5 mm              [ theo-1p ] for brownian motion @xmath65 in the two - dimensional torus @xmath66 , consider the hitting time of a disk , @xmath67 and the @xmath68-covering time , @xmath69 which is the amount of time needed for the wiener sausage of radius @xmath68 to completely cover @xmath66 .",
    "then @xmath70        the basic approach used to prove these results , which goes back to ray , @xcite , is to control occupation times using excursions between concentric discs .",
    "the approximate tree structure that is ( implicitly ) used arises by considering discs of the same radius @xmath38 around different centers and varying @xmath38 ; for fixed centers @xmath74 , and `` most '' radii @xmath38 ( on a logarithmic scale ) the discs @xmath75 and @xmath76 are either well - separated ( if @xmath77 ) or almost coincide ( if @xmath78 ) .",
