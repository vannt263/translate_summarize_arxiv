    "athena_. they carried out pre - simulations , whereby starting with an isothermal icm they allowed radiative cooling without thermal conduction to obtain a cooling core state , and then used _ it _ as the `` initial condition '' for their self - consistent mhd simulations . for the initial magnetic field",
    "the authors numerical experiments included a case of rotational field lines .",
    "they concluded that thermal conduction alone can not be the solution to the cooling flow problem .",
    "moreover , they hypothesized that the nature of the agn feedback is one of `` stirring '' rather than heating , that is , agn activity periodically disrupting the azimuthal field structure allowing thermal conduction to sporadically heat the core .",
    "the level of effectiveness of `` stirring '' however remains an open question .",
    "for example , cooling - core clusters like the a2199 contain prominent metal gradients that could prevent violent processes from stirring the icm . in a similar study",
    "@xcite performed a wide range of numerical studies of the a2199 cluster with tangled and radial initial magnetic field topologies and strengths of 1 ng to 1@xmath5 g , extending the parameter study of @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that the effective reduction of the anisotropic heat flux was less than 10% of the spitzer value due to a re - orientation of the magnetic field lines relative to the radial direction induced by the hbi .",
    "this reduction was found to occur withing several times the hbi growth time ( @xmath10.125 gyr for a2199 ) , leading to a cooling catastrophe in less than @xmath13 gyr .",
    "the authors found similar trends at different initial magnetic field strengths and topologies .",
    "starting with lower initial core densities and isothermal initial temperature the cooling catastrophe was significantly delayed to @xmath17 gyr .",
    "the cooling catastrophe was also delayed when a central heating source was assumed via an idealized model of the heating luminosity within a radius of 20 kpc .",
    "the authors concluded ( at least for a2199 ) that in the absence of agn feedback and/or strong magnetic fields near the galaxy cluster core , thermal conduction alone can not be responsible for balancing the radiative losses in the icm , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "similar results about the reduction and evolution of the effective heat flux were obtained by @xcite using the 3-d mhd code _",
    "there is a large body of numerical work on various aspects of agn - icm interactions that has spanned purely hydrodynamic models ( e.g. ) , as well as mhd models ( e.g. @xcite ) . yet , a conclusive picture regarding the cooling flow problem based on numerical simulations appears to remain elusive .",
    "for example , @xcite simulated direct injection of a supersonic jet into the icm atmosphere .",
    "however , this model failed to maintain long - term thermal balance in the cluster , leading to hypotheses of heating by the dissipation of sound waves or the decay of global icm modes ( e.g @xcite ) . also , @xcite argue based on comparisons with experimental data that agn outflows are strongly decelerated , generating turbulent sonic or subsonic flows due to their interaction with the surrounding medium , which support such hypotheses .    in this paper we present results from a series of 2-d numerical experiments aimed at assessing the driving physics and related sensitivities in a galaxy cluster .",
    "we have chosen to simulate a2199 , a cooling - core cluster that has been simulated by other authors ( e.g. @xcite ) , and for which observed data for the electron number density and temperature exist at a relatively close distance ( @xmath61 kpc ) from the cluster center .",
    "the density at the core is an important parameter in mhd parameter studies that aim to assess mechanisms associated with the sustainment ( or collapse ) of the thermal balance in a cluster , since the radiative cooling rate depends strongly on it ( @xmath7 ) . because a2199 is a cluster that is often modeled by mhd simulations , we perform here a series of idealized numerical experiments in 2-d axisymmetric geometry to assess the sensitivity of the collapse rate on the near - core density , using two different spatial profiles that bounded the observational data ( @xcite ) .    in 3-d mhd simulations it is common to prescribe initial profiles that are in hydrostatic equilibrium . often , the observational data guide solutions to the hydrostatic equation and then these solutions are prescribed as the `` initial conditions '' of the icm .",
    "mhd simulations then proceed to seek of mechanisms that maintain thermal balance in the cluster . in this study",
    "we perform a series of numerical experiments that do not begin with solutions in hydrostatic equilibrium , to assess dynamical effects in the energy balance of the system .",
    "our simulations include a range of initial magnetic field profiles ( similar to those used by @xcite and @xcite ) and quantify the self - consistent evolution of the icm in 2-d planar geometry .",

    "they have been upgraded significantly through the contributions of many scientists in the united states .",
    "although the majority of the work with mach today is in the area of pulsed power , their application base has expanded to multiple areas in engineering . however , to the best of our knowledge , they have not yet been used to study problems in astrophysics . in order to introduce these codes to the astrophysical community , we provide a more detailed description of the codes and their applications in appendix a.    mach2 is the version used in the present study .",
    "a feature of mach2 that has been particularly useful in our studies is its modularity with the terms in the mhd equations , which allowed us to perform instructive comparisons between the various simulation physics in the evolution of the icm .",
    "the numerical experiments have been carried out using a reduced set of the full mhd conservation laws of mach ( see appendix a ) .",
    "simulations in only two dimensions allow a wide range of highly - resolved cases at reduced computational time , but at the expense of excluding processes in the evolution of the icm that are inherently 3-d .",

    "the latter assumed that the hydrogen and helium fractions are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our assumption in equation ( [ poissonsgrav ] ) about the dominance of the dark matter density in the determination of the gravitational acceleration appears acceptable .",

    "the lagrangian time advance of the mass density , velocity and magnetic vector fields are computed implicitly on a computational domain that , unless otherwise noted , is discretized by a uniform mesh that consists of square computational elements ( or `` cells '' ) .",

    "spatial discretizations are obtained using finite volume differencing .",
    "the radiation cooling algorithm advances the internal energy explicitly , whereas thermal conduction is performed implicitly . because we have assumed that the gravitational acceleration is dependent only on the dark matter density , @xmath21 is prescribed using equation ( [ nfwgravaccel ] ) and is held fixed throughout each simulation .",
    "several combinations of initial conditions for the scalars and vectors have been used throughout this study , all associated with the a2199 galaxy cluster .",
    "specifically , for the number density and temperature of the plasma we employ two different profiles to illustrate the sensitivity of the icm simulations on the assumed initial conditions .",
    "the first profile is a fit of the zakamska @xmath54 narayan `` best '' solution to an idealized set of four , time - independent , ordinary differential equations that account for thermal conduction and radiation cooling only , in hydrostatic equilibrium .",

    "the authors showed that for five out of the ten clusters studied a pure conduction model balancing radiative cooling , i.e. @xmath73 was plausible if the factor _",
    "f _ was reduced from unity by more than 50% .",
    "because this best - fit solution yields an electron number density near the core which is about 35% lower than the observed value , we shall label it `` lcd '' ( low core density ) .",
    "the lcd profiles are plotted in fig .",
    "[ initialprofiles ] against @xmath74 data ( @xcite , also in @xcite ) .",
    "some mhd simulations in the literature have employed initial density profiles that underestimate the observed electron number density by factors of 5 - 6 near the cluster core ( e.g. see @xcite and @xcite ) . to assess the importance of the core conditions on the evolution of the icm we constructed a second set of initial conditions in a manner similar to that followed by @xcite , who assumed hydrostatic equilibrium and a polytropic eos with a prescribed profile for the entropy @xmath75 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the hydrostatic equation is given by @xmath83 assuming spherical symmetry , equation ( [ hydrostaticeqn ] ) may be written in terms of the non - dimensional density and entropy as follows : @xmath84 and , given @xmath85 , yields the density as a function of radius .",
    "the gravitational acceleration is taken from equation ( [ nfwgravaccel ] ) .",

    "although neither the lcd nor the hcd profiles represent accurately the density observations , they were implemented in this manner deliberately as limiting solutions that bounded the full range of the data , within the constraints of the hydrostatic equilibrium condition , while illustrating the sensitivity of the simulation results on the density .",
    "an extensive body of work exists on the magnetic field structure in galaxy clusters covering both cooling - core and non - cooling - core clusters .",
    "faraday rotation measures towards extended radio sources in and behind galaxy clusters have demonstrated the turbulent nature of the magnetic field there ( e.g. see @xcite , , , , , @xcite , , ) . in general",
    "it has been found that a power - law distribution of their fluctuation spectrum and some radially - declining profile of their average strength represent well these magnetic field structures .",
    "nearly all hydrodynamical simulations within a cosmological context predict around 10% of turbulence within the icm ( e.g. see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and are in agreemnt with observations ( e.g. see , @xcite ) . consequently , since the magnetic field is frozen within such turbulent icm , cosmological mhd simulations predict that the magnetic field has a turbulent spectrum ( specific examples can be found in , @xcite ) with no exception when studying a sample of clusters or during the time evolution of a single cluster .",
    "the reason for this is that clusters forming in a cosmological context contain accreting matter , part of which forms by small - scale - structure mergers .",
    "therefore , clusters may be populated by thousands of sub - structures in the form of galaxies or former groups of galaxies that move through the cluster with speeds that are typcially on the order of a thousand km / s , permanently perturbing the underlying potential .",
    "it has been shown that such gravitational perturbations alone can produce significant motions within the core of clusters ( e.g. see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "some very small fraction of these sub - structures contains also gaseous atmospheres or disks capable of steering the icm directly .    to assess the impact of initial magnetic field topologies on the evolution of the effective thermal conduction in the icm we employed here the following three initial magnetic field configurations : ( 1 ) a turbulent field ( using random number deviates ) , ( 2 ) a purely rotational field and ( 3 ) a purely radial field .",
    "the intent of the last two highly - idealized configurations was to assess the sensitivity of the anisotropic heat flux reductions , and have served as the two limiting cases of our parameter studies on magnetic fields . in all three cases",
    "the out - of - plane component of the magnetic field , @xmath95 in the 2-d axisymmetric cases and @xmath96 in the planar cases , was set to zero .",
    "the turbulent field was constructed based on the approach followed by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "first , we set up a random field in @xmath97-space , using independent normal random deviates @xmath98 ( with 0 and 1 being the values of the mean and standard deviation of the random distribution , respectively ) for the real and imaginary components : @xmath99=\\left[n_1b , n_2 b\\right]\\nonumber \\\\ b_{y}(\\textbf{\\textit{k}})=\\left[re(b_{y}),im(b_{y})\\right]=\\left[n_3b , n_4b\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the wavenumber magnitude is @xmath100 and subscript `` a '' is a number used to identify different random deviates . @xcite proposed the following dependence of the magnetic field amplitude on the wave number @xmath101 : @xmath102 exp\\left(-k_1/k\\right ) , \\label{bspectrum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 and @xmath104 control the exponential cutoff terms in the magnetic energy spectra .",
    "the former controls the spectra at the large wave numbers and is given by @xmath105 with @xmath106 and @xmath107 denoting the normalized hubble parameter @xmath108 .",
    "the second , @xmath104 , controls the cutoff of the spectra at the small wavelengths ; the case we present in this paper uses @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "once the complex vector field in @xmath97-space has been generated , we perform vector divergence cleaning . using conventional einstein tensor summation notation where @xmath111 is the kronecker delta , this operation may be expressed by ( e.g. see @xcite ) : @xmath112 finally , we perform ( complex ) inverse fourier transformation in 2-d to obtain the * _ r_*-space components @xmath113 $ ] .    because the precise distribution of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters is uncertain , there is no strong evidence in favor of the assumed spectrum in equation ( [ bspectrum ] ) .",
    "therefore , we extend the range of our numerical experiments to include the following two ( extreme ) cases : a rotational profile and a radial profile as given by equations ( [ brotational ] ) and ( [ bradial ] ) , respectively , where @xmath114 is a scaling radius .",
    "@xmath115 @xmath116 these two additional cases have been used exclusively in the 2-d planar simulations and the results are presented in section [ subsec : planarsims ] . for both cases the out - of - plane component @xmath96 was set to zero .",

    "hereinafter , it will be implied that when we present simulation results without a magnetic field , thermal conduction has been computed isotropically , whereas for simulations that include a magnetic field thermal conduction has taken into account the anisotropic effects ( see equations [ eqn : thcondtensor ] and [ eqn : heatflux ] ) .",
    "table [ tab:2daxisymmetricsims ] lists the cases carried out in 2-d axisymmetric geometry .",

    "due to the dependence of the cooling rate on the square of the electron density , @xmath127 , we expect the solution will depend strongly on the near - core gas density ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , if one assumes that the dominant competing mechanisms establishing the thermal balance in the icm are thermal conduction and radiation only , and all other mechanisms are captured by a single effective reduction of the thermal conductivity ( represented by the quantity _ f _ ) , we can estimate of this sensitivity from the steady - state energy equation [ icmenergyideal ] , by computing directly the heat flux factor @xmath128 of the cluster .",

    "@xmath135 when @xmath136 @xmath64 ,    which illustrates to first order the sensitivity of idealized solutions on the near - core plasma density .",
    "the significance of this sensitivity may be better appreciated by comparing the following relevant time scales .",
    "first , the characteristic time @xmath137 associated with the isothermalization of a region with a temperature gradient @xmath138 , may be estimated by setting @xmath139 yielding @xmath140 ( with @xmath141 ) .",
    "next , the characteristic time @xmath142 in which the plasma radiates away all of its internal energy is obtained in a similar manner yielding @xmath143    if the mechanism(s ) in the icm produce an effective reduction of the thermal conductivity @xmath135 , then the conduction time would be more than double the radiation time , assuming the plasma density near the core is as high as the observed value .",
    "in other words , without any additional heating source(s ) , these estimates suggest that thermal conduction from the outer regions of the cluster can not avert runaway cooling near the core .",
    "indeed , 2-d axisymmetric simulations with mach2 that incorporated only thermal conduction and radiation ( mhd was turned off in this series of calculations ) show that thermal balance is achieved at a relatively low value of @xmath128 ( between 0.5 - 0.6 ) for the lcd profile , whereas the hcd profile leads to the collapse of the core for the same values of @xmath128 .",
    "figure [ rzsolutions ] ( top ) shows the evolution of the computed temperature at @xmath6320 kpc for different values of @xmath128 , when lcd initial profiles were used .",
    "mesh sensitivity calculations confirmed that a @xmath144 uniform mesh provided sufficient resolution .",
    "figure [ rzsolutions ] ( bottom ) compares the lcd solutions to those obtained using the hcd profiles for @xmath145 0.5 and 0.6 , showing collapse of the core in less than 1 gyr .",
    "thus , determining a global value for _ f _ that would sustain thermal balance in the cluster may be in general instructive ; quantitatively , however , it is of less significance due to the sensitivity of _ f _ on the central density .    due to the extremely high hall parameters in the icm ( @xmath146 in a2199 ) the potential impact of turbulent magnetic fields in the transport of heat from the outer ( hot ) regions of the cluster has been widely recognized .",
    "although the evolution and impact of mhd instabilities , specifically of the hbi ( e.g. see @xcite ; @xcite ) and of the magneto - thermal instability ( mti ) ( e.g. see @xcite ; @xcite ) , remain an ongoing topic of study , we performed here an idealized numerical experiment with a turbulent initial magnetic field ( see section [ subsec : ibconditions ] ) that was kept frozen throughout the simulation .",
    "the intent was to emulate a scenario in which continuous galaxy motions sustain a nearly - isotropic turbulent field .",
    "the simulation case was motivated in part by the work of @xcite , who suggest it is possible that turbulent velocity fields in the cluster may drive ( or stir ) turbulence in the magnetic field in a manner that allows for sufficiently rapid transport of heat from the outer regions of the icm to sustain thermal balance .",
    "figure [ rzsolutionsfrozenfield ] ( top ) shows contours of the initial temperature overlaid by unit vectors of the initial magnetic field as implemented in our 2-d axisymmetric simulation .",

    "[ rzsolutionsfrozenfield ] ( bottom ) . also shown for comparison is the case with no magnetic field .",
    "for all cases in this series of simulations the thermal conductivity was computed self - consistently , accounting fully for the anisotropy in the heat flux , but magnetohydrodynamics were excluded .",
    "we found that thermal conduction alone is unable to avert a cooling catastrophe , even when the magnetic field is completely tangled .",
    "the collapse of the core for the 1-@xmath5 g case was found to be insensitive to the value of peak magnetic field , which is expected due to the high values of @xmath148 . in this arrangement",
    "a change in the collapse rate was obtained only when the peak magnetic field magnitude was lowered by several orders of magnitude ( where @xmath149 ) .    by comparison ,",
    "@xcite found in their 3-d simulations of a2199 that a cooling catastrophe could be averted .",
    "the authors applied a driving force that resulted not only in keeping the magnetic field tangled but also in turbulent flows that introduced additional physical effects such as mixing , which we do not account for in our 2-d axisymmetric simulation .",
    "we also recognize that the real topology of the magnetic field is unknown and may differ significantly from the idealized model described in section [ subsec : ibconditions ] .",
    "nevertheless , in view of the sensitivity of thermal balance calculations on the plasma density it appears that hypotheses about `` stirring '' or other dynamical activity in the icm , proposed as mechanisms that could sustain thermal balance in the cluster , would only be strengthened if such mechanisms sustained balance in the cluster for a wide range of possible core densities .",
    "@xcite employed an initial temperature profile that was in close agreement with the _ chandra _ data and a plasma density profile with values almost six times lower than the observed data near the cluster core .",
    "in this section we perform an idealized study in two dimensions near the core of a2199 , focusing on possible mechanisms that may overcome hbi - driven collapse ( @xcite ) . in the 3-d mhd",

    ", we deliberately violate this condition only as a means to generate and study near - core flow dynamics ( @xmath15020 kpc ) that may possibly be associated with agn activity .",
    "we deviate from hydrostatic equilibrium by prescribing the spherically - symmetric initial conditions lcd and hcd ( fig .",

    "we note that although both these profiles correspond to hydrostatic equilibrium in three dimensions , they do not preserve such equilibria in two dimensions , thereby producing subsonic wave motion in the plasma .",
    "here we focus only on the early dynamics of the mhd flow field , @xmath151 2.5 gyr , near the cluster center ( @xmath15220 kpc ) , since several simulations of a2199 have predicted a cooling catastrophe due to the hbi within this time for a wide range of magnetic field strengths and profiles . assuming a weak magnetic field initially in the direction of the gravitational force , the hbi has a characteristic growth rate ( @xcite ) @xmath153 @xmath154 ( 0.125 gyr)@xmath155 .",

    "also , because the initial conditions imposed zero velocity , the plot at @xmath172 gyr simply reflects that the evolution of the internal energy of the system is initially driven by thermal conduction and radiation , but by @xmath11.4 gyrs temperature gradients near the core are found to be almost completely smoothed out .",
    "the diminishing effect of anisotropic thermal conduction is even more evident in the case of a rotational initial magnetic field , which is found to reduce on - average the heat flux to the core within the time interval of interest by more than one order of magnitude compared to the case of a turbulent initial field ( see fig .",

    "the evolution of the pertinent average parameters is shown fig .",
    "[ fs - azm - lcd ] ( left ) .",
    "the rotational magnetic field remains approximately orthogonal to the radial unit vector ; the angle between them does not fall below @xmath178 deg . yet , this has little effect on the evolution of the temperature during this time .",
    "this may seem counterintuitive at first since the characteristic times associated with the smoothing of temperature gradients in the icm by thermal conduction are larger in the rotational - field case as the effective heat flux factor is significantly lower compared to the turbulent field ( equation [ eqn : hbigrowth ] gives @xmath17312 gyr for _ _",

    "however , thermal conduction does not drive the temperature in these cases .",

    "figure [ 2dlcd - azm ] depicts the evolution of the temperature showing the smoothing of the temperature gradients despite the preservation of a highly - rotational magnetic field within the time interval of interest .",
    "thus , under the induced conditions @xmath170 dominates over thermal conduction .    the 2-d axisymmetric simulations in section [ subsec : axisymsims ] with only radiation and thermal conduction demonstrate a strong sensitivity of the solution on the assumed initial core density , with the hcd profile yielding a collapse of the core at values of @xmath128 for which the lcd profile yielded no cooling .",

    "the resulting expansion is weaker compared to the lcd case ( 10 km / s wave front speed in hcd versus 100 km / s in lcd ) and the gravitational force is able to turn the flow at @xmath6320 kpc inward relatively fast , within about 0.1 - 0.2 gyr , and the plasma beyond this time continues to flow radially inward .",
    "this is in contrast to the lcd case with a rotational magnetic field where the velocity field fluctuates between inward and outward directions ( note that we plot the absolute value of the radial velocity ) . the temperature contours at t=0.16 gyr are shown in fig .",
    "[ 2dhcd - trb ] .",
    "thus , the response of the temperature in fig . [ compareznwithopoly2 ] and of the non - dimensional quantities in fig .",
    "[ fs - azm - lcd ] ( right ) responded considerably faster than in the lcd case .",
    "the solutions with a peak strength for the initial magnetic field of 1 ng show only minor differences with the 1-@xmath5 g cases .",
    "the works of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have been particularly influential in formulating the different cases presented in this paper .",
    "our 2-d axisymmetric simulations reproduce closely the effective heat flux factor of @xcite under similar assumptions for a2199 , when thermal conduction and ( bremsstrahlung ) radiation are the only physics allowed in the energy balance of the cluster , and when the electron number density and temperature profiles closely resemble the authors `` best - fit '' solution ; we have termed this solution as the `` lcd profile . ''",
    "because the lcd profile underestimates the _ chandra _ density observations near the core by approximately 35% ( albeit in excellent agreement with the data beyond @xmath110 kpc ) , we performed a second set of simulations with an initial profile that was in agreement with the observed electron density near the cluster center but overestimated the data at larger distances .",
    "differences in the temperature profiles between the two cases were less than 5% for r@xmath150200 kpc . because the ratio of characteristic time for thermal conduction over the time for radiative cooling is strongly dependent on the electron density , @xmath178 ( assuming everyting else fixed ) , the goal of these simulations was to determine what effect such an increase would have on the thermal balance in the cluster .",
    "by comparion to the lcd case we found that the icm collapsed catastrophically in the hcd case for the same values of the heat flux factor _ f_. our conclusions from this series of idealized simulations regarding the importance of the core density in the evolution of the icm are in agreement with the conclusions of @xcite , who illustrated the dependence of the icm collapse rate on the value of the plasma density at the center . a turbulent initial magnetic field that was held fixed throughout the simulation also led to the collapse of the icm for both initial density profiles ( lcd and hcd ) . in this series of simulations",
    "the anisotropy of the conduction heat flux was accounted for by invoking the approximations of @xcite for the thermal conductivity coefficients .",
    "the magnetic field was generated by a method proposed by @xcite , and was held frozen to emulate an extreme case in which galaxy motion maintains the turbulent field in the absence of any flow dynamics in the icm .",
    "since it remains largely infeasible to perform fully - consistent cosmological simulations of clusters that account for all pertinent physics and scale lengths , most often in mhd simulations the thermodynamic state and magnetic field topology are prescribed as the `` initial conditions '' of the icm cluster and the simulations then proceed to seek of mechanisms that maintain thermal balance in the cluster .",
    "such simulations do not always begin with an icm in thermal balance but all studies we have reviewed imposed hydrostatic equilibrium at t=0 . referring to fig .",
    "[ initialprofiles ] , it is interesting to note that the trend of increasing density near the core ( @xmath17910 kpc ) based on the observed data appears to be one that crosses the two hydrostatic - equilibrium solutions , namely the lcd and hcd profiles .",
    "this suggests that , at least near the core of a2199 , deviations from such equilibria may be at play .",
    "in fact , @xcite hypothesize the presence of a relatively weak ( @xmath1801.5 ) isothermal shock in this region .",
    "the mhd simulations in 2-d planar geometry we performed here were intended to serve as a preliminary series of numerical experiments to assess possible deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium in connection with transient agn activity and/or remnant dynamical activity from the early formation of the galaxy cluster . to span a wide range of magnetic field effects we employed initial strengths and topologies similar to those imposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the 2-d results now also form the basis for near - future 3-d simulations with mach3 .",
    "we were particularly interested in the initial response of the plasma near the core ( @xmath1511.3 gyr , @xmath6320 kpc ) because radiative cooling and the hbi have been shown to lead to a runaway catastrophe in a2199 in this region in less than 3 gyr ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it has been proposed that mass and momentum transport from low - speed winds ( @xmath110,000 km / s ) associated with agn outbursts , can have a dramatic effect on the growth of the central supermassive black hole ( @xcite ) and , in turn , on the agn - icm coupling .",
    "we deliberately imposed in the initial thermodynamic state of the icm a deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium , thereby producing subsonic expansion flow upon initiation of the simulation . by inducing a non - zero velocity field early in the simulation we allowed for ( thermal ) pressure work to contribute to the energy balance of the system .",
    "in fact , under the induced conditions , pressure work eventually overwhelmed the deleterious effects of the magnetic field , which in the idealized hydrostatic case would have shut off the main supplier of heat to the region ( in the absence of an agn sources ) , namely thermal conduction .",
    "it is noted that only the scalar ( thermal ) pressure was included in this work ; its importance in the presence of a subsonic velocity field and a magnetic field in this region suggests that the full pressure tensor may have to be accounted for as proposed by @xcite ) . in all three cases studied with different initial magnetic field , and for both initial density profiles ( hcd and lcd )",
    ", we obtained similar results by 2-d mhd simulations about the sustainment of the temperature near the core .",
    "in this paper we presented results from a series of numerical experiments in two dimensions for the a2199 galaxy cluster .",
    "the simulations employed a relatively wide combination of initial conditions and simulation physics .",
    "it is acknowledged that the 2-d physical domains did not permit us to address a wide range of possible physics in clusters that are inherently 3-d , and the propositions presented herein shall be re - evaluated in three dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , the number of cases performed in this study yielded constructive insight that now also forms the basis of our near - future simulations with mach3 .",
    "we chose a2199 largely because observed data for this cluster exist at a relatively small radius from its center ( @xmath1811 kpc ) .",
    "as a consequence , our idealized 2-d axisymmetric simulations aimed to quantify the sensitivity of the icm thermal balance on the plasma density profiles with less ambiguity compared to other clusters for which such data does not exist .",
    "the computed differences in the heat flux factor for the two profiles we used were not insignificant .",
    "therefore , it appears it would be instructive that mhd parametric studies , performed to asses the sensitivity of proposed dominant physics in the icm and its sustainment / collapse ( e.g. hbi , mti , agn heating , turbulence stirring ) , extended their range to include higher values of the plasma density near the cluster center .",
    "the results of the 2-d planar simulations demonstrate that imbalances in the system s hydrostatic equilibrium , inducing relatively weak flow dynamics , may overcome the effects of the magnetic field on the diffusion of heat from the outer regions of the cluster .",
    "this marginalizes the significance of anisotropic thermal conduction over transient flow events in the icm .",
    "such events may possibly be associated with agn pulsations at the cluster center , with characteristic dynamical times that are hundreds of times shorter than the hubble time .",
