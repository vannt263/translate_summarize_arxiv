    "since einstein s relativistic theory tell that the matter can convert into energy , the possibility of converting energy into matter , i.e. , the electron - positron pair , as predicted by dirac in quantum electrodynamics @xcite , has attracted a great deal of interest@xcite . in presence of a static and uniform electric field , the quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) vacuum may break down and decay into electron - positron pairs due to a quantum tunneling effect @xcite .",

    "recently , various numerical approach were developed to deal with the time dependent dirac equation@xcite , the klein paradox@xcite , the zitterbewegung@xcite , and the pair production process @xcite .",

    "theoretical investigations are expected to make the physics of the creation clear and predict a higher generation rate . however , the pauli exclusion principle will block further creation once the bound states are occupied , resulting a asymptotic saturation behavior@xcite .",
    "motivated by this requirement and a better understanding of the pair creation process in the one - dimensional well potential , we examine the pair creation in a well with its width or depth oscillating . by oscillating the width and depth , the transfer channels for population",

    "theoretical approach @xcite has been established to overcome the single particle picture described by quantum mechanics and the mathematical difficulty of quantum electrodynamics . in this section",
    "we will briefly review this method and describe that how do we deal with the model in this paper .",
    "the field operator can be expressed in terms of the electron annihilation and positron creation operators as@xcite    @xmath39    in which @xmath40 is the solution of the filed - free dirac hamiltonian ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 is the time dependent solution of the dirac equation , and the term @xmath43 denotes the summation over all states with positive ( negative ) energy .",

    "we can also get it from the negative part of the field operator by compute the number and spacial distribution of the holes . in this paper",
    "we use this expression ( eq . ) to reduce the computational cost , because @xmath66 has been calculated in eq .. furthermore , we can neglect the larger part of the momentum ( @xmath67 is far greater than @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) in the numerical simulation , for its contribution to the matrix element @xmath70 is very small . in the following ,",
    "the number of spatial points is @xmath71 , and we only take @xmath72 discrete momentum into account .    based on the projection of the field operator onto the the field - free electronic states in this method and the definition of electron and positron in the dirac hole theory , in this paper we will present physical quantities for all time and focus on the moments when the field is absent .",

    "but for a super - critical depth , @xmath74 , the domain @xmath75 exist , and bound states in the well are possible ( which we call  bound states embedded in the negative continuum  ) : their wave function do not decrease exponentially out the well , but join a continuum wave of the same energy @xmath76 out the well , hence the wave function has a non - zero probability outside .",
    "an empty bound state will spontaneously be occupied by an electron ( two , if the spin is considered ) from the filled dirac sea , and the hole ( identified as positron ) will travel away from the well to infinity @xcite .",
    "this is the picture of spontaneous creation of electron - positron pair . for a static well potential , electrons will fill the embedded bound states , and",
    "the pauli principle will prevent further pair creation",
    ". the number of pair created should be the number of bound states which meet these conditions .    for a time dependent potential , the situation is more complicated . in paper @xcite ,",
    "the effect of open and close a pair - creation channel was studied .",
    "the well depth is fixed at @xmath77 , while the width @xmath22 varies between @xmath78 and @xmath79 . for @xmath80 , there is one bound state embedded in the dirac sea , and there are two for @xmath81 . after enough time for saturation , the pair number will increase as one more channel is opened , but do not decrease as one of the two channels is closed .",
    "the reason is that the annihilation of the pair need the electron and positron to be in the same place , which is not satisfied because the electron remains in the well while the positrons have left the creation zone and escaped to the opposite direction .",
    "naturally , one can propose that if the channel is opened and closed periodically , can this mechanism will lead to a continuously pair creation ?",
    "moreover , for fixed @xmath22 and varying @xmath20 , since the diving behavior is similar ( fig .",

    "<S> in this paper we show that electron - positron pairs can be pumped inexhaustibly with a constant production rate from the one - dimensional well potential with oscillating depth or width . </S>",
    "<S> bound states embedded in the the dirac sea can be pulled out and pushed to the positive continuum , become scattering states . </S>",
    "<S> pauli block , which dominant the saturation of pair creation in the static super - critical well potential , can be broken by the ejection of electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the width oscillating mode is more efficient that the depth oscillating mode . in the adiabatic limit , pair number as a function of upper boundary of the oscillating , will reveal the diving of the bound states . </S>"
