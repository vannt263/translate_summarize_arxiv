    "the so - called  black hole lattice universe \" has been firstly investigated by lindquist and wheeler in 1957@xcite .",
    "they regularly arranged @xmath1 potions of the schwarzschild spacetime on a virtual 3-sphere ( @xmath2 , 8 , 16 , 24 , 120 and 600 ) , and discussed evolution of this lattice universe based on the intuitively derived junction conditions between the schwarzschild shell and the 3-sphere .",
    "the black hole lattice universe is often used as one of tools to evaluate effects of local non - linear inhomogeneities on the global expansion .",
    "recently , black hole lattice universe models have been revisited by several authors@xcite .",

    "@xcite , and those time evolutions have been investigated in refs .",
    "we call this cubic lattice model the  black hole universe \" in this paper .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the black hole universe so that it admits a positive cosmological constant .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been reported that , if the box size of the black hole universe is sufficiently larger than the horizon radius , the global expansion law can be well approximated by that in the einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "our final purpose is to check this fact with a positive cosmological constant . since our universe is likely to be filled with dark energy components , such as the positive cosmological constant , it is important to investigate the effect of local non - linear inhomogeneities on the global expansion law with the cosmological constant .",
    "in the all references listed above , the cosmological constant is set to be zero .",
    "therefore , solving technical problems to consider non - zero cosmological constant cases , we investigate it in this paper .",
    "one of non - trivial technical problems is how to construct an initial data set which is appropriate as a initial condition for the time evolution . in this paper , we describe a procedure to construct puncture initial data for the black hole universe with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "another interesting problem is to find different kinds of marginal surfaces .",
    "as in the case of kottler(schwarzschild - de sitter ) solution , the black hole universe with a positive cosmological constant can have not only black hole horizons but also de sitter cosmological horizons . as far as we know , it is first time to numerically find the @xmath3 cosmological horizons without any symmetry which makes it possible to reduce the number of the effective dimension . to check the existence and structure of marginal surfaces",
