    "<S> in 1927 , heisenberg heuristically disclosed the tradeoff between the error in the measurement and the caused disturbance on another complementary observable . in quantum theory , most uncertainty relations are proposed to describe the level of unavoidable uncertainty in the measurement process . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> we ask how much information , rather than how much uncertainty , can be gained during two sequential measurements . to achieve the optimal information gain , </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the strategy for an `` intelligent '' prior apparatus is to clone the unknown state and , for the posterior apparatus , the swapping operation should be performed in the posterior apparatus . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a coarse - grain random access code , and therein information causality as a physical principle can be exploited to derive the upper - bound of information gain . </S>",

    "<S> , there is always tradeoff in measuring two non - commuting observables . to access some observable of an quantum object </S>",
    "<S> , one must specify definite experiments as the measurement processes . in heisenberg s original </S>",
    "<S> thought , determining an electron s position with the attainable accuracy must reduce the measurement precision of another complementary observable , such as momentum . in detail , when an electron is scattered by photons , the position is instantly determined . however , the momentum undergoes a `` discontinuous change '' due to the scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> general speaking , in the sequential quantum measurements , the prior measurement may include error , and the caused disturbance generates a discontinuous change for the latter measurement outcome . </S>",
    "<S> hence the term `` error - disturbance relation '' is designated as a suitable name of uncertainty principle .    </S>",
    "<S> researchers attempt to tackle quantum measurement uncertainty using alternative approaches . considering the thought experiment of observing an electron using an imaginary gamma - ray microscope , heisenberg put down the relation @xmath0 in 1927 . </S>",

    "<S> first , heisenberg s picture is usually exploited in ozawa s formulation . </S>",
    "<S> here we exploit schrdinger s picture , which aids in elucidating the substantial role of quantum cloning . </S>",
    "<S> we can describe the sequential measurements as the quantum circuit , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , as previously mentioned , we focus on information gain . </S>",
    "<S> how the state is disturbed is not our main concern . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that error comes from imperfect quantum cloning . </S>",
    "<S> third , the concept of joint measurement is exploited in ozawa s study @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the  role of respective unitary evolution in either apparatus @xmath3 or @xmath5 is not clear described .    </S>",

    "<S> the intuitive answer is positive with a @xmath34 cloning machine ( pcm ) , that is , @xmath35 if one were to perfect @xmath34 cloning ( @xmath36 ) followed by the swapping operation between the object and probe @xmath4 ( @xmath37 ) , the states of both probes @xmath38 and @xmath39 would be the same state , @xmath40 ; hence it were to access full information of the measured observables @xmath2 and @xmath4 both . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the quantum no - cloning prevents the simultaneous vanishing of noise and disturbance . for physical realization , we propose that the optimal information gain where @xmath41 as the optimal @xmath34 cloner and @xmath42 as the swapping operation are used , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> notably , we do not know of other non - trivial or accidental means for getting optimal information gain , which is outside the scope of this paper .    to tackle the error - disturbance relation from an informational perspective </S>",

    "<S> ineq.([ic ] ) can be revised as follows @xmath85    to evaluate the upper bound of the mutual information , we exploit the following lemma .    </S>",

    "<S> let variables @xmath88 and @xmath89 be @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath114 ( @xmath115)@xmath116 alice and bob s outcomes must either perfect or anti - perfect correlated , which leads to 1-bit of information gain .    </S>",
    "<S> case ( b ) consider the symmetric cloning with @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition @xmath118 yields 1-bit of information gain . </S>",
    "<S> however , </S>",
    "<S> the latter measurement is meaningless because @xmath56 is either parallel or anti - parallel to @xmath55 .    case ( c ) let the observables of these two measurements be most incompatible ( e.g. , @xmath119 ) . in this case , we set @xmath120 and @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal value @xmath122 in ( [ result ] ) can be achieved using the symmetric cloning with the condition @xmath123 . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath124    in the general crac , alice has an @xmath125-bit local database @xmath126 , where @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129 , and the measurement basis states \\{@xmath130 , @xmath131 } are exploited during the encoding phase followed by classical one - bit communication . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , bob wants to access the @xmath129-th bit @xmath132 by measuring @xmath133 with @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed optimal strategy for bob is to performs @xmath135 phase covariant cloning and measures the observable @xmath136 on the object with the @xmath137-th copied state . </S>",

    "<S> , width=302 ]    at the end of the paper , we proposed a method of employing the crac in the continuous variables , such as position and momentum of a one - dimensional quantum system . instead of precisely measuring the position and momentum , </S>",

    "<S> the imperfect quantum cloning and information causality are key to determining the upper bound of the information gain . </S>",
