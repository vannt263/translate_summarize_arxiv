    "there has been a renewed interest in dynamical properties of scalar fields coupled to gravity in the presence of a negative cosmological constant since the appearance of the paper @xcite by bizo and rostworowski .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that generic spherically symmetric initial data evolves into a black hole state , for arbitrarily small amplitudes of the initial data .",
    "numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that energy is transferred from low to high frequency modes , reminiscent of turbulence , leading to the instability of such space - times . since one expects that space - times with a negative cosmological constant , @xmath4 , are asymptotically anti - de sitter ( aads ) , these results are of substantial interest from the viewpoint of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the turbulent instability , which transfers energy from low to high frequency modes and leads to black hole formation , is triggered by a resonant mode mixing .",
    "it was then suggested that a similar mode mixing and instability already occurs in vacuum aads spacetimes @xcite .",
    "it has also been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that there is no resonant mixing if the perturbation expansion starts from a single linearized mode .",
    "the corresponding states are periodic , so there is no black hole formation in those exceptional cases . for the pure gravity case",
    "these states are the ads correspondents of the geons postulated by wheeler @xcite .",
    "it was argued in another paper , that in case of negative @xmath4 , these periodic states are nonlinearly stable @xcite .",
    "time - periodic solutions of the self - gravitating massless klein - gordon scalar system for @xmath5 have been constructed recently in @xcite , where their stability have been also demonstrated .",
    "the present work is devoted to a somewhat simpler but similar system , a real scalar field , @xmath6 , ( both massless and massive ) on a fixed anti - de sitter background assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "the study of this system helps us to answer questions such as which part of the observed phenomena is due to the gravitational interaction , and which arise from the effectively bounded nature of the ads spacetime due to its conformal time - like boundary . in the fixed ads background case",
    "there is obviously no black hole formation , but resonant mixing and turbulent instability is likely to occur in some cases . in our earlier study numerical simulation of the time - evolution of a spherically symmetric scalar field with potential @xmath7 has been performed @xcite .",
    "we have illustrated on a concrete example , that the energy density of initial wave - packets may increase by 5 orders of magnitude after a few hundred reflections from the time - like boundary of ads space - time .",
    "such a drastic increase of the energy density seems to strongly depend on the potential , in particular for the standard @xmath8 potential , @xmath9 , and also for @xmath10 , no such dramatic energy density increase has been seen .    in this paper",
    "we carry out a detailed study of spherically symmetric , spatially localized , time - periodic scalar field solutions on a fixed ads background , when the nonlinearity is provided by the scalar field interaction potential @xmath11 .",
    "it is well known that on ads space - times a free scalar field theory ( linear klein - gordon theory , i.e.  @xmath12 ) even for @xmath13 admits regular , spatially localized , time - periodic breather - type solutions @xcite .",
    "in fact these solutions are known analytically , and they form a discretely infinite family indexed by the nodes of the scalar field . as a matter of fact , when a real scalar field is coupled to gravitation on aads space - times",
    "the wave equation continues to admit a discretely infinite family of breathers even when the scalar field is massless ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "there are breather solutions on a fixed ads background for general @xmath11 potentials which have a minimum . in this paper",
    "the localized oscillating states on ads are called breathers , because they are truly localized and oscillate exactly periodically . on flat background",
    "the only such state is the well known sine - gordon breather , which exists only for the sine - gordon potential @xmath14 , and even for that potential , only in one spatial dimension .",
    "interestingly , there are very long living localized oscillating states even on flat minkowski background , which are called oscillons@xcite , for other potentials or other dimensions , but they are not exactly periodic .",
    "they emit energy very slowly , accompanied by a slow change of their amplitude and frequency @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the energy emission rate of small - amplitude oscillons is exponentially small in terms of a parameter corresponding to the central amplitude @xcite .",
    "flat background oscillons only exist for massive fields , since the frequency of small amplitude oscillons is determined by the scalar field mass .",
    "furthermore , the size of small - amplitude oscillons grows without limit , inversely proportionally to their decreasing amplitude . on the other hand ,",
    "breathers on ads background also exist for zero mass scalars , since their size in the small - amplitude limit tends to a finite value determined by the cosmological constant .",
    "moreover , the frequency of ads breathers formed by zero mass scalars approaches the number of spatial dimensions in the theory .",
    "massive scalar fields coupled to einstein s gravity also can form long living oscillating localized objects , which in the @xmath15 case are called oscillatons in the literature@xcite .",
    "oscillatons are not exactly periodic , but they are extremely long - living , the mass loss rate of oscillatons is exponentially small in terms of an amplitude parameter@xcite . unlike flat background oscillons ,",
    "self gravitating oscillatons can be formed from a massive klein - gordon field , since gravity provides the necessary nonlinearity .",
    "similar objects to self - gravitating oscillatons , but with ads asymptotics , are also expected to exist for @xmath5 , in which case they should be exactly periodic , so they might be called breathers as well . the time - periodic solutions formed by self - gravitating massless klein - gordon fields with @xmath5",
    "have been studied recently in @xcite .    in the small amplitude limit",
    "the ads breathers we construct are nonlinear deformation of of the linear klein - gordon ( kg ) breathers , existing only for a discrete set of frequencies .",
    "the nonlinearity induced by the self - interaction potential leads to one parameter families of solutions parametrized by their amplitudes , with their frequencies @xmath3 , reducing in the limit @xmath16 to the corresponding value of that of the kg breather . in the small amplitude limit our perturbative construction permits to deduce analytically the frequency - amplitude relation to leading order in arbitrary dimensions and potentials .",
    "these perturbative results are found to be in excellent agreement with high - precision numerical computations .",
    "medium amplitude states can be described by perturbational expansion methods , but large amplitude breathers can only be studied by direct numerical analysis .",
    "the obtained periodic solutions for the scalar field on fixed ads background necessarily contain some numerical round - off errors . hence using them as initial data for a numerical time - evolution code provide information about their stability .",
    "this type of analysis strongly indicates that up to a certain amplitude the breather solutions are nonlinearly stable .",
    "remarkably not only the basic ( nodeless ) breathers are stable , but even those with several nodes .",
    "one can expect that it is easier to find stable periodic solutions on ads background than on minkowski background , since in this case energy can not dissipate to infinity .",
    "the natural boundary condition at ads infinity , which is generally used for a minimally coupled scalar fields , implies that energy dissipated towards infinity gets back to the central region in a finite time again . among the larger amplitude",
    "periodic states there are unstable configurations",
    ". these do not decay completely , but keep on oscillating , however with an amplitude which is generally a complicated function of time .",
    "their evolution does not show sign of turbulent instability either , energy is not transferred continuously to high frequency short wavelength modes .",
    "an interesting feature of the numerically constructed breather solutions is that if we plot the central amplitude as a function of the frequency then thin resonant peaks appear on the plot at certain frequencies .",
    "fourier decomposing the time dependence of the field , it appears that near these resonances one of the higher fourier modes starts to grow .",
    "the spatial profile of these growing modes turns out to be very similar to that of a klein - gordon breather with several nodes .",
    "furthermore the frequency of the corresponding klein - gordon breather is relatively close to the frequency of the resonant peak .",
    "nonlinear effects are responsible for a shift in the frequency , and further studies would be worthwhile in order to understand the resonant peaks better .",
    "we note that similar resonant frequencies already occur in the much simpler system , where a single scalar field evolves on a one dimensional flat torus @xcite .",
    "numerical evolution shows that generally there are unstable periodic states close to these resonances .",

    "[ sec - scalars ] we present the used coordinate systems and the equations describing the scalar fields .",

    "it turns out that for solutions with finite energy the scalar field necessarily tends to zero at large radiuses , so the finite energy solutions are the same as the localized solutions in this system .",
