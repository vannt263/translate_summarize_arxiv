    "the problem of taking the continuum limit remains to be the most important issue in the lattice calculation of @xmath0 using the quenched kogut - susskind quark action .",
    "we have been making effort to elucidate the effect of scaling violation over two years since 1995 .",
    "our early study@xcite carried out at @xmath6 showed a linear decrease of @xmath0 in @xmath4 in contrast to @xmath3 scaling violation theoretically predicted@xcite .",
    "the run was then extended to @xmath7 6.4@xcite , at which a departure from a linear behavior was observed , indicating the onset of @xmath3 behavior .",
    "this implied a cancellation between an @xmath8 and higher order terms that leads to an apparent @xmath9 behavior for lower values of @xmath10 .",
    "we have now extended the run to @xmath10=6.65 employing a @xmath11 lattice to settle the issue of the continuum extrapolation .",
    "we also briefly address the problem of @xmath12 effect , on which we gained insight after the present conference .",
    "we have slightly revised the method of analysis in obtaining @xmath0 in the continuum since lattice 96@xcite .",
    "lattice values of @xmath0 are converted to the continuum value in the @xmath13 scheme with the naive dimensional regularization ( ndr ) by applying one - loop renormalization@xcite at the matching scale @xmath14@xcite .",
    "the one - loop renormalization factor is evaluated with the 3-loop running coupling constant @xmath15 with @xmath16 = 0.23 gev , estimated in the continuum limit from our results for the @xmath17 meson mass .    the continuum value of @xmath0 at the physical scale @xmath18 2 gev is calculated from @xmath19 via the 2-loop running of the continuum renormalization group : @xmath20 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times   \\left [ { \\alpha_{\\overline{ms}}(q^*)}/{\\alpha_{\\overline{ms}}(\\mu ) } \\right]^{-\\gamma_0/2\\beta_0 } b_k({\\rm ndr},q^ * ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24@xcite .",
    "this matching procedure leaves @xmath5 uncertainty , which however should vanish logarithmically in the continuum limit@xcite .",
    ".run parameters and results for @xmath25 [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "table  [ tab : run ] lists the parameters of all our runs to date , together with @xmath0(ndr , 2 gev ) obtained with gauge non - invariant and invariant operators at each @xmath10 .",
    "finite - size studies have been carried out at @xmath26 and 6.4@xcite .",
    "the finite size effect is less than 1% above 2.3  fm at both @xmath10 , though it increases to 2% below 2.0  fm at @xmath27 .",
    "we have therefore focused our runs on a physical spatial lattice size of @xmath28  fm .",
    "we expect the finite size effect to be less than our statistical errors .",
    "= 8.5 cm    in fig .",
    "[ bkmro ] we present @xmath0(ndr , 2 gev ) as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "the leftmost points are the new data taken at @xmath30 on a @xmath2 lattice . the new data points strongly support an @xmath3 behavior , the onset of which was noted in lattice 96 at @xmath7 6.4 .",
    "the effect of higher order terms is not discernible for @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , we fit the five points above @xmath32 with the form @xmath33 , which is shown by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ bkmro ] .",
    "the continuum extrapolation gives @xmath0(ndr , 2 gev)=0.616(5 ) for the gauge non - invariant operator , and 0.580(5 ) for the invariant one , the average of the two being 0.598(5 ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    it has been noted that the two operators yield different values in the continuum@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ bkmro ] ) . after lattice 97",
    "a further analysis was made on this point , which we report in this write - up .",
    "the difference between gauge non - invariant and invariant operators should receive not only @xmath3 scaling violation but also @xmath34 errors from the matching procedure .",
    "figure  [ difbk ] plots this difference as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "small errors resulting from a correlation between the two operators allow us to fit the five data points with the form @xmath35 , giving @xmath36 and @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "the solid line indicates the fit , and others show the breakdown into the @xmath8(dotted line ) and @xmath39(dashed line ) contributions . allowing for a non - zero constant @xmath40 ,",
    "similar fitting gives @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "encouraged by this analysis we attempt to fit the five points at @xmath44 simultaneously for both operators including their correlations , with the form @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this fit yields @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and hence we impose the constraint @xmath49 in our final fit . in the continuum limit the fit ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ bkmro ] ) gives @xmath0 ( ndr , 2 gev ) = 0.628(42 ) .",
    "the error is roughly ten times larger than the one from the quadratic fit .",
    "this originates from uncertainties of the coefficient of @xmath39 terms : @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the difference , however , is well constrained ; @xmath52 agrees well with @xmath53 obtained above .",
    "we find larger coefficients @xmath54 and @xmath55 when @xmath56 is used , or @xmath57 and @xmath58 if mean - field improvement of the operators is not made .",

    "@xmath0(ndr , 2 gev)=0.627(42 ) for @xmath16=0.22  gev and 0.628(41 ) for 0.24  gev in the continuum limit .",
    "as our final value of @xmath0 in the continuum limit we adopt the result from the fit including the @xmath39 term , @xmath60 which includes a systematic error due to the 2-loop uncertainty .",
