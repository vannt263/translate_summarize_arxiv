    "hence @xmath39 is the 44 component of the interacting susceptibility tensor determined from the non - interacting one as above , except that @xmath41 is replaced by a diagonal matrix with a zero in the 44 position and @xmath41 in the remaining part of the diagonal .",

    "this corresponds to the case considered by brenig and becker @xcite of @xmath55 .",
    "the raman - scattering intensity vanishes identically in this case , independent of the value of @xmath27 .",

    "@xmath58 is the coupling parameter for the uniform magnetization component , @xmath59 of importance in the presence of an external field * h*. the @xmath60 symmetry of the tetrahedra allows different kinds of anisotropic interactions .",
    "based on the analysis of the raman - scattering experiments we shall concentrate on the following dm anisotropy term : @xmath61_c^{}\\ ] ] proportional to the @xmath47 component of the cross product .",
    "the values of the five ( six ) parameters in the case of cu@xmath0te@xmath0o@xmath1br@xmath0 are determined to be ( @xmath62 ) @xmath63 the strongest coupling in the system @xmath9 is derived from the high - temperature susceptibility measurements assuming fixed values for the remaining ones .",
    "the value of @xmath58 is mainly determined by the high - field magnetization measurements in the ordered phase , see fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] , but still has a large uncertainty of about 20% . due to the @xmath64 anisotropy the bulk susceptibility becomes anisotropic .",
    "the anisotropy is minute in the paramagnetic , but substantial in the ordered phase .",
    "independent of its sign @xmath64 implies that the ordered staggered moment @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ e.2 ] ) is directed along the @xmath47 axis . the bulk susceptibility along this direction",
    "is predicted to vanish exponentially at low temperatures whereas the perpendicular component stays approximately constant below .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with experiments , as shown in fig .",
    "the experimental data are unfortunately somewhat disturbed by other contributions , as reflected in , for instance , a sample dependence of the results .",
    "the zeeman energy gained in the perpendicular case induces a spin - flop transition , when the field is parallel to the @xmath47 axis , to a phase where the staggered moments become perpendicular to the field .",
    "the model predicts the spin - flop field to be 3.7 t , nearly independent of the temperature below .",
    "this spin - flop transition has not yet been observed , but the anisotropy measurements in fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] were made at a field of 5 t indicating that the spin - flop field is larger than 5 t. @xmath26 has no influence on the bulk susceptibility , above , and is adjusted so that the model predicts @xmath65 k at zero field .",
    "figure [ f.3 ] shows the transition temperature for a polycrystalline sample as a function of field .",
    "it is remarkable that  increases with the field .",
    "the raman spectra of the cu@xmath0te@xmath0o@xmath1(br@xmath2cl@xmath3 compounds have been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal magnetic excitation at zero wave vector is observed in the br system at 2.1 k , when the incoming and scattered light are polarized along the @xmath47 axis .",
    "this part of the results is shown in fig .",
    "the high - resolution data revealed an additional peak at slightly higher energy than the longitudinal excitation , appearing when a field is applied perpendicular to the @xmath47 axis .",
    "gros  @xcite interpreted the extra peak to be the @xmath14 singlet level , which is becoming visible due to a dm component in the cross section combined with the level mixing induced by the field .",
    "the problem with this explanation is that the field - induced mixing is weak , and a dm cross section as large as the normal part would only produce a peak of the size of a hundredth of the main one .",
    "the alternative explanation is that it is the hamiltonian itself , which is responsible for the mixing of the levels .",
    "the only possible term producing such an effect is the @xmath64 coupling defined by eq .",
    "( [ e.10 ] ) .",
    "@xmath64 gives rise to a coupling between the longitudinal mode and the @xmath14 level even at zero field .",
    "the application of a field perpendicular to the @xmath47 axis diminishes the energy difference between the two levels and the hybridization is strongly increased .",
    "the two peaks would attain equal intensities at a field slightly larger than the experimental maximum field .",
    "figure [ f.4 ] compares the intensities predicted by the model , eq .",
    "( [ e.8 ] ) with @xmath66 , with the experimental ones . in these calculations @xmath64 and @xmath10 , plus",
    "one intensity scale parameter in each of the two cases , have been utilized as adjustable parameters .",
    "the experimental raman shifts are subjected to an absolute uncertainty of the order of 4 @xmath67 and a relative one of the order of 1 @xmath67 .",
    "the relative uncertainty has been reduced by performing a translation of each spectrum so that the phonon frequencies in each case coincide with those observed in the sample at zero field . because of the large absolute uncertainty we have tried to mimic the relative behavior rather than to get the right values for the absolute frequencies .",
    "the model thus leads to a good account of both the frequencies and the intensities if shifting all the calculated peaks rigidly by @xmath68 @xmath67 .",
    "the model we shall present now for the cu@xmath0te@xmath0o@xmath1cl@xmath0 system is more speculative . in comparison with the br compound",
    "the @xmath69 and @xmath47 lattice parameters in the cl system are reduced by 3 and 1% , respectively , whereas the intra - tetrahedral distances between the cu atoms are increased by about 1% , see ref.@xcite . in correspondence to these changes @xmath9 is reduced in the cl compound whereas the nel temperature is increased .",
    "a first guess of a model for the cl compound would be the same one as discussed above with some appropriate adjustments of the coupling parameters . the model based on this assumption predicts a strong raman - scattering peak at about 40 @xmath67 , two to three times as intense as in the br system if assuming the scattering coefficients @xmath70 to be the same .",
    "however , the raman spectra clearly show a quick and systematic reduction of the magnetic scattering with the concentration @xmath5 of the cl ions , see fig .",
    "one possible explanation would be that it is the raman scattering circumstances , not the model itself , which is drastically changed .",
    "this could be achieved by introducing a non - zero @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ e.7 ] ) , which @xmath49 should then approach @xmath71 in the pure cl system .",
    "we have analyzed this possibility , but found it to be both implausible and not capable of reproducing the observed non - monotonic changes of the raman spectra with @xmath5 .",
    "the analysis of the magnetization measurements shown in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] indicates that @xmath11 is close to 1 in the cl compound , so although @xmath9 is reduced @xmath10 increases with the cl concentration .",
    "when @xmath72 then @xmath26 has to be about @xmath73 in order to produce a transition to the @xmath27 ordered phase at @xmath74 k. another possibility is that in both systems @xmath75 whereas @xmath76 , then the increase of @xmath77 from about 0.7 in the br to about 1 in the cl compound is a sufficient cause for a change of the order parameter from @xmath27 to @xmath29 . based on this possibility , the model of cu@xmath0te@xmath0o@xmath1cl@xmath0 is proposed to be ( @xmath78 ) : @xmath79 this model produces the magnetization and susceptibility results displayed in the figs .",
    "[ f.1 ] and [ f.2 ] , and  is found to be nearly independent of an external field , as shown in fig .",
    "most importantly , the assumption of a @xmath29 instead of a @xmath27 ordering implies a reduction of the calculated magnetic raman - scattering intensities by nearly a factor of 10 .",
    "furthermore , instead of one longitudinal mode the present model predicts two main peaks ( at 43 and 75 @xmath67 ) , plus a third one ( at 57 @xmath67 ) observable if the polarization vectors of the light have a component perpendicular to the @xmath47 axis .",
    "this is , at least qualitatively , in much better agreement with the raman experiments @xcite than that predicted by a @xmath27 ordered phase .",
    "the analysis by gros  @xcite of the tetrahedral spin-@xmath4 cluster system cu@xmath0te@xmath0o@xmath1br@xmath0 has been extended , and the raman - scattering results have been explained quantitatively by introducing a dzyaloshinskii - moriya anisotropy term in the hamiltonian , which term also accounts ( partly ) for the anisotropy of the system below .",
    "the ordered phase in this compound is the one , where @xmath80 is parallel and @xmath81 antiparallel with the @xmath47 axis .",
    "a spin - flop transition is predicted to occur when applying a field along the @xmath47 axis .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the magnetic raman spectrum ( leaving out the two - magnon scattering part ) depends on the resulting mean field , but not on the relative orientation of the magnetic moments on neighboring tetrahedra .",
    "a determination of this would require a neutron - diffraction investigation .",
    "the present analysis of the raman spectra indicates that the ordering in cu@xmath0te@xmath0o@xmath1cl@xmath0 compound is of the @xmath10-type , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are perpendicular to each other and to the @xmath47 axis .",
    "the evidences are indirect and the @xmath10-structure needs to be verified by diffraction experiments .    the mean - field / random - phase approximation is a relevant starting point , whenever the interactions are strong enough to induce magnetic ordering .",
    "this is also true close to quantum criticality ( pr - metal may serve as a good example for that , @xcite ) .",
    "the non - mean - field behavior of the present frustrated system appears to be accounted for by the treatment of each tetrahedral cu - spin cluster as a local dimerized unity .",
    "the analysis shows that the specification of the properties of the local spin clusters requires at least three parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath64 .",
    "the values of the three mf parameters @xmath58 , @xmath26 , and @xmath57 , which correspond to three different combinations of the exchange interactions between neighboring tetrahedra , indicate that both the interactions perpendicular and parallel to the @xmath47-axis chains of tetrahedra are important and therefore that the system is three- rather than one - dimensional .",
    "the good coincidence between the predictions of the mf / rpa theory and the experimental results is a further argument for a three - dimensionality of the magnetic interactions in the two compounds ."
