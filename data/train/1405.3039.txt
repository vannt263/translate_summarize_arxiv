    "in chemical reactions , it is common that a certain reaction should in principle be allowed , but in reality can not take place ( or occurs at extremely low rates ) because of the presence of some large energy barrier . fortunately , the situation is sometimes redeemed by the presence of certain chemical substances , referred to as catalysts , which effectively lower the energy barrier across the transformation .",
    "that is to say , catalysts significantly increase the reaction rates . importantly",
    ", these catalysts can remain unchanged after the occurrence of the reaction , and hence a small amount of catalytic substance could be used repeatedly and is sufficient to facilitate the chemical reaction of interest .",
    "the basic principles of chemical reactions are governed by thermodynamic considerations such as the second law .",
    "there have specifically been a number of recent advances in the quest of understanding the fundamental laws of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "these efforts are especially focused on the quantum nano - regime , where finite size effects and quantum coherences are becoming increasingly relevant .",
    "one particularly insightful approach is to cast thermodynamics as a resource theory @xcite , reminding of notions in entanglement theory @xcite . in this framework , thermodynamics can be seen as the theory that describes conditions for state transformation @xmath0 from some quantum state to another under _ thermal operations _ ( to ) . the notion of to means allowing for the full set of global unitaries which are energy preserving in the presence of some thermal bath .",
    "this is a healthy and fruitful standpoint , and allows the application of many concepts and powerful tools derived from information theory @xcite .    in the context of thermal operations , catalysts emerge as ancillatory systems that facilitate state transformation processes : there are cases where @xmath0 is not possible , but there exists a state @xmath1 such that @xmath2 _ is _ possible .",
    "the metaphor of catalysis is appropriate indeed : this implies that by using such a catalyst @xmath1 , one is enabled to perform the thermodynamic transformation @xmath0 , while returning the catalyst back in its _ exact _ original form .",
    "this is called _",
    "exact catalysis_. the inclusion of catalyst states in thermal operations serve as an important step in an eventual complete picture of quantum thermodynamics ; it allows us to describe thermodynamic transformations in the full picture , where the system is interacting with experimental apparatus , for example a clock system .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that one can obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for exact catalysis in terms of a whole family of generalised free energies @xcite .",
    "the ordinary second law of ever - decreasing free energy is but the constraint on one of these free energies .",
    "naturally , for physically realistic scenarios inexact catalysis is anticipated , where the catalyst is returned except for a slight degradation .",
    "however , rather surprisingly , it has been shown @xcite that at least in some cases , the conditions for catalytic transformations are highly non - robust against small errors induced in the catalyst .",
    "the form of the second law thus depends crucially on the measure used to quantify inexactness .",
    "in particular , if inexactness is defined in terms of small trace distance , then there is no second law at all : for any @xmath3 one could pick _ any _ two states @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and starting from @xmath6 , get @xmath7-close in terms of trace distance to @xmath8 via thermal operations .",
    "we refer to this effect as _ thermal embezzling _ : here one observes that instead of merely catalysing the reaction , energy / purity has possibly been extracted from the catalyst and used to facilitate thermodynamic transformations , while leaving the catalyst state arbitrarily close to being intact @xcite . on physical grounds ,",
    "such a setting seems implausible , even though it is formally legitimate .",
    "a clarification of this puzzle seems very much warranted .    argued formally , a first hint towards a resolution",
    "may be provided by looking at how the error depends on the system size .",
    "naturally , the trace distance error @xmath7 depends on the dimension of the catalyst states @xmath9 ; nevertheless one can find examples of catalysts where @xmath10 as @xmath11 approaches infinity .",
    "while examples show that in principle thermal embezzling may occur @xcite , hardly anything else is known otherwise .",
    "indeed , it would be interesting to understand the crucial properties that distinguish between a catalyst and an active reactant in thermodynamics . from a physical perspective",
    ", it seems highly desirable to understand to what the effect of embezzling can even occur for physically plausible systems .    in this work ,",
    "we highlight both the power and limitations of thermal catalysis , by providing comprehensive answers to the above questions raised .",
    "firstly , we construct a family of catalyst states depending on dimension @xmath11 , which achieves the optimal trace distance error while facilitating the state transformation @xmath0 , for @xmath4 and @xmath5 being some arbitrary @xmath12-dimensional states .",
    "this is done for the regime where the hamiltonians of the system and catalyst are trivial .",
    "secondly , we show that thermal embezzling with arbitrary precision can not happen under reasonable constraints on the catalyst .",
    "more precisely , whenever the dimension of the catalyst is bounded , we derive non - zero bounds on the trace distance error . by making use of splitting techniques to simplify the optimization problems of interest , such bounds",
    "can also be obtained when the expectation value of energy of the catalyst state is finite , for catalyst hamiltonians with _ unbounded _ energy eigenvalues and a finite partition function .",
    "we hence set very strong limitations on the possibility of enlarging the set of allowed operations in quantum thermodynamics , if systems with reasonable hamiltonians are being considered .",
    "we begin by exploring the case for vanishing , trivial hamiltonians , where it is known that thermal embezzling can occur .",
    "this is also the simplest case of thermodynamics in resource theory @xcite , when all energy levels are fully degenerate , and the hamiltonian is simply proportional to the identity operator .",
    "entropy and information , instead of energy , become the main quantity that measures the usefulness of resources . in such cases ,",
    "the sole conditions governing a transition from some quantum state @xmath4 to @xmath5 is that the eigenvalue vector of @xmath4 majorizes that of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this is commonly denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "such a condition also implies that entropy can never decrease under thermal operations  @xcite .    to investigate thermal embezzling in this setting",
    ", one asks if given fixed @xmath14 , what is the smallest @xmath7 such that there exists a catalyst state @xmath1 that satisfies @xmath15 where the trace distance @xmath16 between the input catalyst @xmath1 and output catalyst @xmath17 is not greater than @xmath7 .",
    "this trace distance is used as a measure of catalytic error throughout our analysis .",
    "if some catalyst pair @xmath18 satisfies condition eq .   with trace distance @xmath7 ,",
    "then it also facilitates @xmath19 for any @xmath12-dimensional states @xmath20 .",
    "this is because a pure state majorizes any other state , while the maximally mixed state @xmath21 is majorized by any other state .",
    "since majorization conditions depend solely on the eigenvalues of the density matrices @xmath1 and @xmath17 , one can phrase this problem of state transformation in terms of a linear minimization program over catalyst states diagonal and ordered in the same basis ( see appendix ) .",
    "in fact , the eigenvalues of @xmath22 which give rise to optimal trace distance error can be solved by such a linear program , although these eigenvalues are non - unique . whenever @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an integer , we provide an analytic construction of catalyst states , which we later show to be optimal for the state transformation in eq .  .",
    "let the initial catalyst state @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 note that our catalyst state @xmath1 does not have full rank , and this is crucial for the majorization condition in eq .",
    "to hold , since @xmath13 implies that @xmath29 , and the joint state @xmath30 can have at most rank @xmath11 .",
    "the output catalyst @xmath31 can be obtained from @xmath1 , by subtracting a small value @xmath7 from the largest eigenvalue @xmath32 and distributing the amount @xmath7 equally over the indices @xmath33 .",
    "this brings @xmath31 to be a state of full rank @xmath11 .",
    "we show that this family achieves trace distance error @xmath34 which we prove by mathematical induction to be optimal , given fixed @xmath35 where @xmath24 ( see appendix ) .",

    "the case for arbitrary states can be treated similarly , and details are given in the appendix .",
    "for the case where two states @xmath4 and @xmath5 are diagonal , the rnyi divergences are defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the eigenvalues of @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .    again , for states",

    "is sufficient to ensure universal thermal embezzling for aribtrary states @xmath44 and @xmath45 as long as they are diagonal in the same energy eigenbasis .",
    "similarly , one can take @xmath1 and @xmath17 to be diagonal in the energy eigenbasis of @xmath59  @xcite .",

    "eq .   can be rewritten as @xmath70 where @xmath71 are the probabilities defined by the thermal state of the catalyst hamiltonian , and @xmath72 is the partition function of the catalyst system . to solve this problem",
    ", we note that the optimal strategy to maximize the quantity @xmath73 within the @xmath74ball of @xmath17 is to increase one of the eigenvalues by @xmath7 , so that the quantity @xmath75 is maximized . with further details in the appendix",
    ", we show that the trace distance error can therefore be lower - bounded by @xmath76 where @xmath77 are the partition functions of the system and catalyst .",
    "although this bound is valid for arbitrary finite - dimensional hamiltonians , it is not tight . indeed , in the case of trivial hamiltonians where all states have constant energy value , normalized to 0 , the partition functions @xmath78 reduce to the dimension @xmath14 of the system and catalyst",
    "this bound then yields @xmath79 , which is much weaker than the optimal trace distance we derived in eq .  .",

    "as before , without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath237 and @xmath238 where @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "the majorization condition @xmath241 again implies that @xmath242 and @xmath243 for @xmath244 . to further simplify matters",
    ", we can also assume that @xmath169 for all @xmath245 .",
    "this is because we can always replace @xmath123 with @xmath246 , where @xmath247 for @xmath245 and @xmath248 is chosen so that @xmath249",
    ". in essence , all the majorization advantage of @xmath123 against @xmath203 can be piled upon the first , largest eigenvalue of @xmath123 .",
    "this replacement is valid since @xmath250 still satisfies the majorization condition .",
    "furthermore , @xmath251 implies that the distance is unchanged .",
    "subsequently , we proceed to bound @xmath200 . to do this , construct a catalyst pair @xmath252 in dimension @xmath253 .",
    "essentially , this is done by directly applying a cut to the dimension of the final catalyst state @xmath203 , reducing it to having dimension @xmath254 .",
    "similarly , the same amount of probability is cut from the initial state , and both states are renormalized .",
    "let us decribe this in more detail : denote @xmath255 and pick index @xmath256 and value @xmath257 so that @xmath258 .",
    "note that @xmath259 , since the majorization condition eq .",
    "implies that @xmath260 this inequality is obtained by summing up the first @xmath261 elements of both distributions in the l.h.s . and r.h.s .",
    "we now define @xmath262 since @xmath263 the states @xmath5 and @xmath264 are properly normalized . to establish that @xmath252 , we need to show that the majorization condition holds true .",
    "we consider two separate cases : when @xmath265 , and when @xmath266 .",
    "if @xmath267 , then the inequalities in the majorization condition for @xmath268 have already been enforced by the majorization condition of @xmath214 .",
    "hence , @xmath268 is a valid catalyst pair in dimension @xmath269 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath270 .",
    "let us now make the following two observations .",
    "1 .   @xmath271 . to see this , recall that @xmath218 for @xmath272 , and thus @xmath273 2 .",
    "@xmath274 . to see this , note that @xmath275 since only the first diagonal element of @xmath5 is strictly larger than the corresponding diagonal element of @xmath264 .    combining observations",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) gives @xmath276 d(\\sigma,\\sigma ' )    \\ge ( 1-d_{m , k } ) d_{m , n},\\ ] ] since @xmath277 rearranging gives us @xmath278 and we have completed the inductive step .    if @xmath266 , then the majorization inequalities involving @xmath279 might fail to hold .",
    "therefore , instead of @xmath268 we consider the following , slightly different , pair of states @xmath280 where @xmath281 the diagonal elements of @xmath282 are still in descending order , and the state is properly normalized . to argue that @xmath283 is a valid pair of catalyst states , we need to verify the majorization inequalities that are not directly implied by the majorization condition for @xmath214 .",
    "that is , we need to verify that for all @xmath284 , @xmath285 where @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "we can see that this is true for the state pair @xmath283 because in this regime of eq .",
    ", both sides increase linearly with the indices @xmath288 , and for the endpoints @xmath289 and @xmath290 , the l.h.s . is higher than the r.h.s .",
    ", which is guaranteed by the majorization condition for @xmath214 , @xmath291 therefore , @xmath292 for any @xmath293 .",
    "taking @xmath294 yields the desired inequality  ( [ eq : majcond ] ) and hence @xmath283 is a valid catalyst pair .",
    "lastly , note that reasoning similar to the one in equation   can be used to deduce that @xmath295 therefore , @xmath296 and we can use the argument from the previous case to complete the inductive step . by this proof of induction",
    "we have shown that @xmath297 for all @xmath298 and @xmath25 .",
    "this together with the conclusion in section [ sec : optfamily ] that @xmath299 proves that @xmath300 and the state pair described in eq .   and",
    "is optimal .",
    "in our work , we use two particular quantities , which are the rnyi divergences for @xmath81 and @xmath301 , which for classical probability distributions have the following form : @xmath302 as mentioned in section [ subsec : d_alpha ] , given hamiltonians @xmath52 and @xmath59 , it suffices to consider @xmath303 here , we prove whenever the dimension of the catalyst ( and system ) are finite , there exists a lower bound on the accuracy of thermal embezzling .",
    "such a bound is dependent on @xmath52 and @xmath59 . to do so , consider the problem @xmath304    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that for initial and target states commuting with the hamiltonian @xmath52 ,",
    "it is sufficient to consider catalyt states commuting with @xmath59 . therefore , since @xmath49 and @xmath58 both commute with @xmath52 , it is sufficient to consider input and output catalysts states which are diagonal in the basis of @xmath59 . since all @xmath63 rnyi divergences are thermal monotones according to lemma [ lem : secondlaw ] , in particular the min - relative entropy ( @xmath305 ) , for @xmath69 , @xmath306 where @xmath307 and @xmath308 are the eigenvalues of @xmath309 respectively . therefore , satisfying the thermo - majorization conditions in eq .",
    "implies that @xmath310 to further simplify this expression , note that @xmath61 and that @xmath311 .",
    "the additivity of rnyi divergences under tensor products holds for all states .",
    "furthermore , @xmath312 for any @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we arrive at the expression @xmath313 where @xmath314 is the partition function of the system .",
    "the spectral values of @xmath1 and @xmath17 are denoted as @xmath315 and @xmath316 , respectively .",
    "using the definition of @xmath305 as shown in eq .  , we obtain @xmath317 where @xmath318 are the eigenvalues of the thermal state for the catalyst , for the energy eigenstate with energy eigenvalue @xmath319 , with normalization @xmath72 , the partition function of the catalyst .",
    "since @xmath320 is the minimum trace distance between states @xmath22 , and @xmath305 depends only on the maximum of @xmath321 across the distribution , the optimal strategy to increase @xmath305 while going from @xmath17 to @xmath1 is to increase a specific @xmath223 by an amount @xmath320 .",
    "therefore , we can consider a relaxation of eq .",
    "@xmath322    in the next lemma , we show that @xmath323 whenever @xmath324 .",

    "then @xmath331 in other words , thermal embezzling of diagonal states with arbitrary accuracy is not possible .",
    "firstly , let @xmath332 indicate the pair such that @xmath333 .",
    "then @xmath334 the first term of l.h.s . is equal to @xmath335 , and therefore can be grouped with the r.h.s . to form @xmath336 since we know that @xmath337 , therefore @xmath338 .",
    "finally , taking the maximization of @xmath339 over @xmath225 gives 1/@xmath340 , recall that @xmath341 corresponds to probabilities of the thermal state being in the eigenstate with energy @xmath342 .",
    "therefore , @xmath343 , and we get @xmath344      the case of arbitrary states are treated separately , since our lemma [ lem : univ_emb ] on universal embezzlers hold only for diagonal states , where necessary and sufficient conditions are known for state transformations .",
    "nevertheless , since the monotonicity of @xmath345 is necessary for arbitrary state transformations @xmath46 , one can use techniques very similar to those in section [ subsec : thermalcat_diag ] to lower bound the embezzling error , if we minimize over diagonal catalysts .",
    "more precisely , denote @xmath346 to be the solution of @xmath347    recall that @xmath61 , and that @xmath345 is additive under tensor products .",
    "therefore , by defining @xmath348 we can rearrange the first constraint in eq .",
    "@xmath349 note that this is almost equivalent to eq .",
    ", except the constant @xmath350 previously is now replaced with @xmath351 . by following the same steps used to prove lemma [ lem : lb_err_catalysis ] , we obtain a lower bound depending on @xmath131 .",

    "then @xmath355\\frac{e^{-\\beta e^c_{\\rm max}}}{z_c } \\neq 0.\\ ] ] this implies thermal embezzling with arbitrary accuracy , using a diagonal catalyst is not possible .",
    "comparing lemma [ lem : lb_err_catalysis ] and lemma [ lem_err_catalysis_arb ] which are very similar , one sees that for non - diagonal states lemma [ lem_err_catalysis_arb ] gives a state - dependent lower bound on the embezzling error .",
    "however for diagonal states , the bound in lemma [ lem : lb_err_catalysis ] can be made state - independent because of the existence of universal embezzlers .      rather than bounding the dimension of the catalyst",
    ", one can ask if restrictions on other physical quantities such as the average energy of the catalyst would prevent indefinitely accurate embezzling from occurring . while this by itself is an independently interesting problem",
    ", we can first note that such restrictions are sometimes related to restrictions on the dimension . in one direction",
    "this is straightforward : if the catalyst is finite - dimensional , then the average energy and all other moments of energy distribution would be finite as well .    here",
    ", we show that by restricting the first and second moments of the energy distribution of the catalyst to be finite , this implies that the states involved are always close to finite - dimensional states .",

    "in this section we provide lower bounds for the error in catalysis , given constraints on the average energy of the catalyst state .",
    "we do so by adding a constraint on the average energy of the catalyst to the problem stated in eq .  .",
    "by looking at the rnyi divergence for @xmath371 , we can show a non - zero lower bound on the catalytic error , for cases where the partition function of the catalyst hamiltonian @xmath72 is finite .",
    "this minimal assumption covers most physical scenarios , especially if we want the thermal state to be a trace class operator to begin with .",
    "again we start with diagonal states , then later generalize to arbitrary states .",
    "firstly , let us recall the problem stated in eq .  .",
    "we aim at minimizing the trace distance between all input and output catalyst states , such that the most significant thermal embezzlement of a smaller system @xmath50 can be achieved .",
    "we denote again the initial and final catalysts by @xmath1 and @xmath17 with spectral values @xmath315 and @xmath316 .",
    "again , by restricting ourselves to look at catalyst diagonal in the hamiltonian basis , and by invoking only the thermal monotone @xmath372 , one can find the alternative relaxed problem @xmath373 where @xmath374 and @xmath375 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath376 with @xmath341 forming a probability distribution ( that of a thermal state ) , one can deduce that whenever the dimension of system @xmath50 is @xmath23 , @xmath377 holds as well .",
    "the solution of this minimization problem serves as a lower bound to the optimal trace distance error .",
    "this problem can be relaxed to a convex optimisation problem .",
