    "new states have been and observed in josephson junctions in the last years .",
    "these states are characterized by a negative josephson energy @xmath6 that is , under certain conditions the josephson critical current @xmath2 changes its sign becoming negative .",
    "this means that the ground state corresponds to the phase difference @xmath7 equal to @xmath8 ( @xmath8-state)@xmath9 but not to zero as it takes place in ordinary josephson junctions .",
    "such states have been observed in josephson junctions of different types:1 ) in multiterminal sns josephson junctions @xcite , 2 ) in junctions consisting of two @xmath10-wave superconductors ( see references in the review @xcite ) , 3 ) in sfs junctions @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) , where s , n and f stand for a superconductor , a normal metal and a ferromagnet , respectively .",
    "the @xmath8-state in sns junctions is created by passing a dissipative current through the n layer .",
    "this current leads to a nonequilibrium distribution function of quasiparticles in the n wire with respect to the equilibrium distribution function in the superconductors . in the @xmath10-wave superconductors ( high @xmath11-superconductors )",
    "the sign of the order parameter @xmath12 depends on the direction in space with respect to crystallographic axes . therefore if two s / n ( or s / i , where i is an isolator ) interfaces have different , properly chosen orientations , then the critical current @xmath13 which is proportional to the product @xmath14 may be negative .",
    "this occurs provided that the order parameter in one superconductor ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) is negative . in sfs junctions the critical current @xmath2 may be negative because the condensate ( gorkov s ) green s function , which determines the current @xmath2 ( or to be more exact , the critical current density @xmath4)@xmath9 oscillates in space changing sign .",
    "the sign reversal of @xmath4 in sfs junctions has been predicted a long time ago by bulaevskii , kuzii and sobyanin @xcite , who considered electron tunneling between two superconductors via a magnetic impurity .",
    "later this effect was studied in sfs junctions by buzdin , bulaevskii and panyukov @xcite ( references to other theoretical papers on this subject is given in the review @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that the current density @xmath4 decays with increasing the thickness of the f layer @xmath17 and changes sign ( damped oscillations of @xmath4 ) .",
    "such a behaviour of the critical current has been observed experimentally in refs . @xcite",
    "; the current @xmath2 decays with increasing the thickness @xmath17 or temperature @xmath18 in a nonmonotonic way changing sign . in the recent paper @xcite",
    "a spontaniously circulating current in a superconducting ring with a sfs @xmath8-junction has been observed .    in this paper",
    "we show that the damped @xmath2 oscillations are not necessarily related to such a dependence of the local critical current density @xmath4 as it was anticipated previously .",
    "the total josephson current @xmath19 , which is measured in experiments , is an integral from the local current density @xmath20 @xmath21 over the whole area of a sfs junction ( we choose a simple , sinusoidal form of  the dependence @xmath22 but the conclusions we make are valid qualitatively in a general case ) .",
    "it is important to have in mind that the phase difference @xmath23 varies in space in the presence of a magnetic field , and in multidomain sfs junctions a spatial dependence of @xmath7 arises even in the absence of an external magnetic field @xmath24 .",
    "it was already mentioned in ref.@xcite that the maximum value of @xmath2 corresponds to zero external magnetic field @xmath25 one can assume that this may be related to a multidomain structure of the f film .",
    "otherwise the maximum value of @xmath2 would be shifted by a certain value of @xmath24 for which the induction @xmath26 is zero , where @xmath0 is the magnetization in a one - domain f film .",
    "we consider a simple model of a multidomain structure of the f film and show that even if the local current density @xmath4 is always positive , the critical current @xmath2 changes sign when the in - plane magnetic flux in a domain @xmath27 is an integer of the flux quantum @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the domain width .",
    "the domain width @xmath29 depends both on the thickness @xmath30 and temperature @xmath18 if the screening of stray magnetic fields by the meissner currents is taken into account @xcite .",
    "therefore the magnetic flux is changed with increasing @xmath30 and temperature leading to damped oscillations of the critical current @xmath31 it will be shown that the dependence @xmath32 may be described by a fraunhofer - like pattern    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the critical current for an uniform ( one - domain ) sfs junction per unit length in the @xmath35-direction ( we assume that all quantities depend only on @xmath36 and @xmath37 see fig.1 ) .",
    "this dependence describes the critical current for the case of domains with an alternating magnetization which takes constant values @xmath38 in domains .",
    "consider a sfs josephson junction in which the f layer consists of stripe domains parallel to the @xmath35-axis ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "= 8 cm    to be specific , we consider the bloch domains , that is , the magnetization vector @xmath39 lies in the @xmath40 plane changing its direction in domain walls of the width @xmath41 . in the case of a narrow domain width",
    "the magnetization vector @xmath0  is parallel to the @xmath35-axis , constant in each domain and rotates in the domain wall .",
    "the magnitude @xmath42  is assumed to be constant everywhere in the f film .",
    "the orientation of the magnetization @xmath0  in the f film ( in - plane or out - of - plane ) depends on many factors such as the curie temperature , the constant of magnetic anisotropy , the film thickness etc ( see for example , @xcite and references therein ) . in ultrathin f films ( a few atomic layers )",
    "a transition between the in - plane to out - of - plane @xmath0  orientation may occur @xcite .",
    "we consider much more thicker f films , used in experiments @xcite , where the magnetization orientation is determined by the direction of easy magnetization .",
    "therefore it is assumed that the axis of easy magnetization is parallel to the plane of the f film . even in the absence of the josephson coupling between the superconductors",
    "s , the meissner currents along the @xmath35-direction are induced by the stray magnetic field @xmath43 @xmath44 ( dashed lines with arrows in fig . 1a)@xmath45",
    "the magnetic field components @xmath46 can be easily found from equations    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the fourier component of @xmath49 , @xmath50 @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the london penetration depth ( in the ferromagnet the penetration depth @xmath53 may be taken infinite because the amplitude of the condensate in the f layer is small and therefore the screening is weak ) .",
    "this equation is supplemented by the boundary conditions @xcite    @xmath54=0,\\text { } [ h_{z}]=4\\pi m_{z}(k_{n},z )   \\label{bc}\\ ] ]    where the square brackets mean a difference : @xmath55=h_{x}(k_{n},d_{f}+0)-h_{x}(k_{n},d_{f}-0).$ ] the component @xmath56is not zero in the domain walls .",
    "this implies that the in - plane component of @xmath57 is continuous across the s / f boundary and the normal component of @xmath58 which exists near the domain walls , experiences a jump .",
    "one can easily solve eqs.([hxz ] ) and find the fields @xmath46 which are connected with the vector potential @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "the expression for  @xmath62 in the superconductor is    @xmath63    where @xmath64 the vector potential @xmath62 in the lower superconductor ( @xmath65 ) has the same sign .",
    "this means that the stray fields @xmath46 lead to the screening currents    @xmath66    which have the same direction in the upper and lower superconductors , but the opposite directions in neighboring domains ( see fig.1a ) .",
    "because the meissner currents flow in the same direction in both superconducting electrodes , they do not lead to a phase difference between the superconductors and do not inluence the josephson current essentially .",
    "these currents may locally reduce the amplitude of the order parameter and therefore decrease the critical current @xmath2 if the magnetization @xmath56 is strong enough .",
    "we will not discuss this simple effect .",
    "if the josephson coupling between the superconductors is negligible ( this case was considered in ref.@xcite ) , the magnetic field has only the components @xmath46 which are determined by the vector potential @xmath67 .",
    "the component @xmath68 is zero .",
    "however the components @xmath69 of the vector potential are not zero .",
    "for example in one - domain case    @xmath70    in the absence of the josephson current the components @xmath71 in a multidomain sfs structure are found from the equations : @xmath72 and @xmath73 however in this case the presence of components @xmath71 does not lead to the superconducting currents and therefore to the appearance of an additional magnetic field @xmath74 the term proportional to @xmath75 in the expression for the supercurrent is compensated by the term proportional to gradient of the phase ( see eq .",
    "( [ max1 ] ) ) .",
    "if the josephson current @xmath76 is not zero , additional screening currents @xmath77 and therefore the component @xmath68 arise in the system ( see fig.1b ) . the component @xmath75 affects the phase difference and therefore the critical current @xmath2 in the junction under consideration .    in order to calculate the critical current @xmath13",
    "one needs to derive an equation governing the phase difference @xmath7 in a multidomain sfs josephson junction . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the thickness of the f layer is small : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the period of the domain structure and @xmath41 is the width of the domain wall ( one can analyze a more general case , but the calculations become more combersome ) .",
    "we need an equation for the component @xmath68 which is related to the local josephson current density    @xmath80    we assumed the simplest form of the relationship between the josephson current density @xmath76 and the phase difference @xmath81 but this assumption is not essential .",
    "we also dropped a contribution to the gauge - invariant  phase difference  which stems from the vector potential and has the form @xmath82 .",
    "one can easily show that this part is smaller than @xmath7 by the parameter @xmath83 ( we choose a gauge in which @xmath84 @xmath85 ) .",
    "let s write down the @xmath36-component of one of the maxwell equations for the current density in the superconductor at @xmath86    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is defined in eqs.([hxz ] ) and @xmath89 is the phase of the order parameter .",
    "subtract eqs.([max1 ] ) taken at @xmath90 and @xmath91 from one another ( a similar method was used by one of the authors in ref.@xcite in the study of collective modes in layered superconductors ) , we get    @xmath92=\\kappa _ { l}^{2}(-[a_{x}]+(\\phi _ { 0}/2\\pi ) \\partial \\phi /\\partial x )   \\label{max2}\\ ] ]    where the square brackets means , as before , a jump across the f layer and @xmath93 is the phase difference .",

    "the contribution of the second term is smaller by the parameter @xmath97 the component of the magnetic field @xmath68 can be found from an equation similar to eqs.([hxz ] ) . with account for the boundary condition ( [ max2 ] ) this equation acquires the form    @xmath98+(\\phi _ { 0}/2\\pi ) ik_{n}\\phi _ { k } )   \\label{hy}\\ ] ]    solving this equation for @xmath68 and substituting the solution into eq.([rothz ] ) , we obtain an equation for fourier components of the phase difference @xmath99    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the inverse josephson length . in the coordinate representation eq.([phik ] ) has the form @xmath102 where the kernel @xmath103 is defined as follows    @xmath104    eq.([phis ] ) describes the dc josephson effect in a simple model of multidomain sfs junctions with a thin f layer .",
    "if the london penetration depth is small compared to the domain size @xmath29 and the width of the domain wall ( @xmath105 ) , then eq.([phis ] ) is simplified@xmath106 this condition means that the characteristic @xmath107 values are much smaller than @xmath108 . in this case",
    "@xmath109 and eq.([phis ] ) acquires the form    @xmath110    this equation differs from the standard josephson equation only by the term on the right - hand side .",
    "one can study various properties of the sfs junctions described by eq.([philoc ] ) or by eq.([phis ] ) , but in this paper we analyze only the critical current and its dependens on different parameters ( external magnetic field , the thichkness @xmath30 etc ) .",
    "first we consider the case of a periodic @xmath111 dependence . if the period @xmath79 of this dependence is much less than the long josephson length @xmath112 then a solution for eq.([phis ] ) ( the relation between @xmath113 and @xmath114 may be arbitrary ) is    @xmath115    where @xmath116 is a function fast varying in space , @xmath117 is a constant ( or a function smoothly varying over the period @xmath29 ) .",
    "the total josephson current ( per unit length in @xmath35-direction ) is    @xmath118    where @xmath119 is given by eq.([phi ] ) . note that the weak josephson coupling does not affect the domain structure , and therefore this structure can studied in the absence of the josephson effect .",
    "as we noted , the domain structure was analyzed theoretically in ref.@xcite for arbitrary @xmath120 and in refs.@xcite for thick f layers ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that the period @xmath29 depends on @xmath30 in a nonmonotonic way and the width of the domain walls @xmath41 may be much less than or comparable with the domain width @xmath29 .",

    "for this structure the josephson current @xmath19 is described by the formula    @xmath129    where @xmath34 , @xmath27 is the in - plane magnetic flux in one domain@xmath106 therefore the critical current @xmath2 , which is given by eq.([fraun ] ) oscillates and decays with increasing @xmath130 this implies that the amplitude of the critical current oscillations decreases with increasing @xmath30 or temperature @xmath18 because the period of the domain structure @xmath79 depends on @xmath131 ( see the theoretical papers @xcite and the experimental paper @xcite , where it was shown that the domain structure is changed with changing @xmath18 ) .",

    "the behaviour of the critical current @xmath2 as a function of @xmath136 is qualitatively the same : the current @xmath2 decreases with increasing @xmath137 and changes sign .    in our model of a periodic domain structure the action of an in - plane external magnetic field @xmath24 on @xmath2",

    "in conclusion , using a simple model of a multidomain sfs josephson junction , we have calculated the critical current @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that the current @xmath2 changes signs when the in - plane magnetic flux @xmath155 in each domain equals @xmath156 the magnetic flux @xmath157 is caused by the magnetization in the ferromagnetic domains and therefore exists even in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
