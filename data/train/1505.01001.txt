    "generalizations of kitaev s toric code @xcite to spaces of higher dimension appear in many contexts .",
    "@xcite makes use of discretizations of riemannian manifolds in order to translate results in systolic geometry to a construction of quantum ldpc codes with distance growing faster than the square root of the block length .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite approach problems in quantum complexity theory using a variant of the model on certain cell complexes .",
    "they also reformulate hypergraph product codes as homological codes constructed from products of chain complexes , which are in turn used in ref .",
    "@xcite to prove the existence of good css codes having stabilizer weights bounded by the square root of the block length . in that paper",
    "it is pointed out that the homological product of the toric code with some fixed code might exhibit anyonic excitations .",
    "other examples include the 4d toric code @xcite and a 3d candidate for self - correcting quantum memory @xcite .",
    "the essential features of all these models can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , one takes a cw complex and puts qudits on its @xmath0-cells for some fixed @xmath1 . for each @xmath2-cell",
    "we form an @xmath3-type stabilizer from its coboundary and for each @xmath4-cell we form a @xmath5-type stabilizer from its boundary .",
    "these stabilizers commute and generate the stabilizer subgroup of a css code .",
    "it is also possible to introduce a local hamiltonian acting on the qudits such that its ground states are exactly the vectors in the code subspace .",
    "there is a freedom in doing this , in this paper we prefer to take the negative of the sum of projections onto the @xmath6 eigenspaces of the stabilizers .",
    "an important property of kitaev s toric code model is that it has excited states which can be interpreted as collections of anyonic quasiparticles@xcite . in order to study these in a mathematically rigorous way",
    ", one needs to formulate the problem in the framework of local quantum physics @xcite .",
    "moreover , since different charges are then identified with inequivalent representations of the algebra of observables , it is necessary to consider infinite systems .",
    "this is done for the square lattice on the plane in refs .",
    "@xcite , where localized excitations are classified and their braiding properties are derived from first principles . under mild additional conditions on the cw complex , the corresponding more general model can also be discussed in this framework , and this is precisely the aim of the present paper .",
    "it turns out that many results from the plane can be generalized to the present setting .",
    "there are some crucial differences , though .",
    "first of all , in the plane there is a unique translational invariant ground state , but there are infinitely many other ground states as well . here",
    "translational invariance does not make sense , instead we concentrate on those ground states which minimize each interaction term to get a reasonably small set of states .",
    "second , in the plane there is a natural selection criterion requiring that charges be transportable and localized in infinite cones . in general one can not speak about cones , therefore we do not know what the `` right '' selection criterion should be .",
    "finally , in the plane it is possible to define braiding in a canonical way , but the definition involves relative orientations of cones , hence it is also not applicable .",
    "the above difficulties prevent us from performing a complete dhr - type analysis . instead , we reformulate some known properties and constructions , invoking the language of algebraic topology , and generalize them to our setting .",
    "this leads to a distinguished class of ground states and low - energy excitations which depend only on the proper homotopy type of the cw complex .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : results ] we briefly state the main results in an informal way . in section",
    "[ sec : examples ] we illustrate the concepts and results on some special cases , namely , the ferromagnetic ising model on certain infinite graphs , the kitaev model on surfaces , and homological product codes . section [ sec : homology ] starts the formal treatment by giving a brief introduction to some tools in the algebraic topology of non - compact cw complexes . besides ordinary cellular homology and cohomology , locally finite cellular ( co-)homology and ( co-)homology groups at infinity",
    "are covered here as a preparation for later sections . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce our model in the c*-algebraic framework . in section",
    "[ sec : ground ] we classify frustration free ground states .",
    "section [ sec : endomorphisms ] generalizes the string operators of kitaev s toric code model to our setting and studies excited states associated with them . in section [ sec : gnsreps ] we discuss properties of the gns representations corresponding to these states . here",
    "we also introduce an invariant which can tell apart some inequivalent representations .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : braiding ] we introduce and calculate a variant of the braiding operators , which can be given the usual interpretation when the space is plane - like .",
    "the model studied in this paper can be described informally as follows ( see section [ sec : model ] for a formal treatment ) . given a cw complex @xmath7 , a natural number @xmath0 and a finite group @xmath8 , we put the hilbert space @xmath9 on each @xmath0-cell of @xmath7 .",
    "we let @xmath10 denote the set of @xmath11 dimensional cells .",
    "cells of various dimensions will be labelled by the symbols @xmath12 .",
    "we will make use of the generalised pauli operators acting on @xmath9 as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is an irreducible character .",
    "the hamiltonian defining the system is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are generalized star and plaquette operators centered at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "these are in turn given as @xmath21 where the notation @xmath22 for an @xmath0-chain @xmath23 means the product of @xmath24 operators acting at the site @xmath25 when there is a term @xmath26 in @xmath23 , and similarly for @xmath5-type operators .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are the boundary and coboundary operators , respectively .",
    "this model admits frustration free ground states ( when the system is finite , every ground state is frustration free ) .",
    "it turns out that the set of frustration free ground states is in bijection with the set of all states on a c*-algebra @xmath29 ( see section [ sec : ground ] for details ) . by analogy with the finite case ( relevant in coding )",
    ", we interpret these as logical states .",
    "the structure of @xmath29 is determined by the @xmath0th homology ( @xmath30 ) and locally finite cohomology ( @xmath31 ) groups and the canonical pairing between the two .",
    "it has a dense subalgebra with a basis consisting of unitaries @xmath32}z^{[b]}$ ] where @xmath33\\in h_{\\text{lf}}^n(e;g)$ ] and @xmath34\\in h_n(e;\\hat{g})$ ] , and they satisfy @xmath35}z^{[b]})(x^{[a']}z^{[b']})=e^{2\\pi i\\langle b , a'\\rangle}(x^{[a+a']}z^{[b+b']})$ ] .",
    "these properties determine @xmath29 essentially uniquely , see proposition [ prop : logicalalgebra ] .",
    "when @xmath30 and @xmath31 are finite groups , @xmath29 is finite dimensional , and the unitaries above form a basis . in this case @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are related to the degenerate and nondegenerate parts of the pairing and satisfy @xmath39 . for a precise statement , see theorem [ thm : logicalstates ] .",
    "this result means that the logical state can store @xmath37 classical bits and @xmath38 qubits of information .",
    "the bijection between frustration free ground states and logical states respects the convex structure .",
    "in fact , a frustration free ground state is pure iff the corresponding logical state is pure ( proposition [ prop : purestrongground ] ) .",
    "if we pass to the gns representations , we find therefore that irreducible representations correspond to irreducible ones .",
    "moreover , the gns representation of a frustration free ground state is a factor iff the gns representation of the corresponding logical state is a factor .",
    "this also implies that quasiequivalence of frustration free ground states is reflected in the quasiequivalence of logical states ( theorem [ thm : stronggroundgns ] ) .",
    "excited states can be created by composing a frustration free ground state with an endomorphism of the algebra of observables .",
    "let @xmath40 be a locally finite @xmath0-chain and @xmath41 an @xmath0-cochain .",
    "for any finite @xmath42 we denote by @xmath43 and @xmath44 their restrictions to @xmath45 , i.e. the chain and locally finite cochain obtained by omitting any term supported outside @xmath45 .",
    "then an endomorphism can be formed as @xmath46 if @xmath47 is a frustration free ground state then @xmath48 minimizes those terms in the hamiltonian which are not centered in the support of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the increase in energy is precisely the sum of the sizes of these supports .",
    "this construction can also produce ground states that are not frustration free ( proposition [ prop : toground ] ) .    in the planar kitaev model",
    "anyonic excitations are described by gns representations which are equivalent to the ground state when restricted to the complement of an infinite cone . for an arbitrary space",
    "we do not know what the `` right '' generalisation of this selection criterion is , but states of the form @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 seem to be the closest analogues of such states , therefore we will call them localized states . in this case @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be thought of as representatives of homology and cohomology classes at infinity .",
    "interestingly , the equivalence class of the gns representation only depends on the classes @xmath54^\\infty}\\in h^\\infty_{n-1}(e;\\hat{g})$ ] and @xmath55_\\infty}\\in h_\\infty^n(e;g)$ ] ( proposition [ thm : equivalent ] ) .    in the other direction , for these states it is possible to introduce an invariant in the form of a unitary representation of @xmath56 in the center of the gns representation . for @xmath57_\\infty}\\in h_\\infty^{n-1}(e;g)$ ] and @xmath58^\\infty}\\in h^\\infty_n(e;\\hat{g})$ ] the representing operator is defined as @xmath59^\\infty},{[c]_\\infty}):=\\lim_{k_\\pm\\to\\mathcal{e}_{n\\pm 1}}\\pi_\\omega\\left(x^{\\partial^t(c - c_{k_-})}z^{\\partial(d - d_{k_+})}\\right),\\ ] ] where the limit is understood in the strong operator topology ( see theorem [ thm : polarization ] ) .",
    "we call @xmath60 the polarization of the state .",
    "the definition of @xmath60 makes sense for states that are close to a frustration free ground state when restricted to a sufficiently distant compact contractible region ( definition [ def : astrong ] ) .",
    "if @xmath54^\\infty}\\in h^{\\infty}_{n-1}(e;\\hat{g})$ ] and @xmath55_\\infty}\\in h_\\infty^n(e;g)$ ] then the polarization of @xmath61 is isomorphic to @xmath62 where @xmath63 is one dimensional and @xmath64^\\infty},{[c]_\\infty})$ ] acts as @xmath65^\\infty},{[c]_\\infty}\\rangle+\\langle{[d]^\\infty},{[\\delta]_\\infty}\\rangle)}$ ] ( proposition [ prop : polarization - endomorphism ] ) .",
    "when @xmath54^\\infty}={[\\gamma']^\\infty}$ ] and @xmath55_\\infty}={[\\delta']_\\infty}$ ] holds , one can find an @xmath0-chain @xmath66 , a locally finite @xmath0-cochain @xmath67 , a locally finite @xmath4-chain @xmath68 and an @xmath2-cochain @xmath38 such that @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "using these is it possible to construct a net in ( the gns representation of ) the observable algebra converging to a unitary intertwiner ( or charge transporter ) between @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the strong operator topology ( proposition [ prop : transporter ] ) .",
    "crucially , if we apply an endomorphism corresponding to a localized excitation to every element in this net , the result will still converge .",
    "this makes it possible to define braiding operations using such nets .",
    "however , the braiding operator will in general depend on the choice of @xmath73 ( see propositions [ prop : braiding ] and [ prop : freedominbraiding ] ) .",
    "as the first example we consider the ferromagnetic ising model with nearest neighbour interactions on a locally finite graph ( i.e. a 1-cell joining each pair of neighbouring @xmath74-cells ) with @xmath75 components and finitely many ends ( see figure [ fig : isingstar ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to taking @xmath76 and @xmath77 . with its",
    "dual using the ring multiplication and the map @xmath78 sending @xmath6 to ( the equivalence class of ) @xmath79 . ]",
    "then we find that @xmath80 is a vector space over @xmath81 with a basis corresponding to the set of connected compontents . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath82 is the number of finite components .",
    "the pairing is nondegenerate on the finite components , therefore @xmath83 . in other words ,",
    "the ground states can store one qubit for each finite component and one classical bit for each infinite component .",
    "it follows that quasiequivalence - classes of frustration free factor ground states are classified by finite bit strings of length @xmath84 .    ]    since @xmath85 , there are no @xmath5-type excitations . on the other hand , @xmath86 is nontrivial when there are infinite components . in this case",
    "@xmath87 is the number of ends of the graph .",
    "a charged sector may be constructed as follows .",
    "take a finite part @xmath45 of @xmath7 such that its complement has @xmath87 connected components .",
    "for each such component there is an endomorphism of type @xmath3 flipping all the spins in that component .",
    "this corresponds to the formal sum @xmath41 of all the vertices in the component .",
    "the coboundary @xmath50 can only contain edges joining a vertex inside @xmath45 with one outside @xmath45 , and the number of such edges is finite .",
    "@xmath88 is isomorphic to @xmath86 . with @xmath45 as above , in each component of its complement we can pick a semi - infinite path .",
    "the formal sum of its edges represents a @xmath74-homology class at infinity . for this representative",
    "the boundary consists of a single point in the component in question , therefore the pairing with the cohomology class at infinity corresponding to that component gives @xmath89 , while with other components we get @xmath74 .",
    "suppose that we start from the ground state with all spins pointing in the `` up '' direction and then flip all the spins in some component of the complement of @xmath45 .",
    "take a semi - infinite path representing a generator of @xmath88 as above .",
    "the value of the corresponding polarization is therefore @xmath90 or @xmath91 depending on whether the spins are flipped from some point along the path or not .    the map @xmath92 is described as follows .",
    "@xmath93 has a basis labelled by the components of the graph , the induced map takes finite components to @xmath74 and each infinite component to the sum of its ends .",
    "the second example is kitaev s model , where the space is a surface and @xmath94 .",
    "for simplicity , we take @xmath77 , but similar results hold for any finite abelian group . in the coding theory context one takes a compact orientible surface of genus @xmath95 together with some cellular decomposition . in this case",
    "the relevant groups are @xmath96 with a nondegenerate pairing , and one gets @xmath97 . since a compact cw complex has finitely many cells , the inclusion maps induce isomorphisms between the ordinary and locally finite ( co-)homology groups . as a consequence , ( co-)homology groups at infinity vanish and we get one gns representation up to quasiequivalence .",
    "this is also clear from the c*-algebraic viewpoint , because in this case the algebra of observables is a full matrix algebra . from the point of view of physics",
    ", the reason is that charged excitations are always created in opposite pairs , hence the total charge is always trivial .",
    "the situation is different when the surface is noncompact .",
    "the simplest example is @xmath98 with the cell structure given by a square lattice ( figure [ fig : kitaevplane ] ) , which has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "in fact , many of our results are inspired by these papers .",
    "first note that @xmath99 implies that @xmath100 is trivial , therefore there is a unique frustration free ground state .",
    "this state was computed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    )",
    "[ fig : kitaevplane ] ]    to understand charged states we need to compute the groups @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "it turns out that both are isomorphic to @xmath81 . the nonzero element of @xmath101 is represented by the formal sum of edges along any semi - infinite path .",
    "the boundary of such a representative consists of a single vertex , which can be interpreted as the location of a charged quasiparticle .",
    "similarly , the nontrivial element of @xmath103 can be found using a semi - infinte dual path . a dual path is a sequence of plaquettes ( 2-cells ) such that consecutive ones share an edge .",
    "the formal sum of the shared edges represents the generator , its coboundary is supported on the first plaquette .    to compute polarization operators in these excited states we need to find the nontrivial elements of @xmath104 and @xmath105 . in the former case it is given by the sum of all vertices while in the latter case by the sum of all plaquettes .",
    "given a finite subset @xmath106 of vertices , the sum of all vertices outside @xmath106 has a finite coboundary , which can be visualized as the set of edges joining @xmath106 to its complement .",
    "it is easier to imagine the situation when @xmath106 has a simple shape , e.g. the set of vertices in a large circle . in this case",
    "the coboundary is a dual path encircling the points inside , therefore it detects a semi - infinite path ( i.e. picks up a factor of @xmath107 ) iff its endpoint lies within the circle . as @xmath106 grows , eventually any point will be inside , therefore the corresponding operator will count the total charge carried by @xmath5-type excitations .",
    "similarly , @xmath105 is generated by the class of the sum of all the plaquettes .",
    "the sum of plaquettes outside some finite subset @xmath108 has a finite boundary .",
    "again , if @xmath108 is the set of plaquettes in a circle then this boundary is a closed path and the operator counts the number of @xmath3-type excitations inside ( mod 2 ) .",
    "the total charge is recovered as @xmath108 grows and eventually contains any plaquette .",
    "it is possible to introduce a braiding on the charged sectors , and it turns out that the quasiparticles are in fact anyons . in our treatment",
    "this will follow from the more general setting discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : homprod ]    slightly more generally , we can consider kitaev s model on a noncompact surface with genus @xmath74 and finitely many ends . to obtain such a surface properly embedded in @xmath109 , we cut @xmath110 circular holes in the unit sphere and attach copies of the cylinder @xmath111 along the boundaries of the holes .",
    "we denote this surface by @xmath112 ( figure [ fig : starfish ] ) .",
    "a cw structure can be given using those on the sphere and on the cylinder .",
    "we remark that @xmath113 , therefore we can get back the results for the plane as a special case .     holes on a @xmath114-sphere and attaching semi - infinite cylinders .",
    "( @xmath115)[fig : starfish ] ]    one can compute that @xmath116 and the pairing between the two is trivial .",
    "indeed , for any cylinder one can take a closed path ( dual path ) going around the @xmath117 factor .",
    "these are nontrivial , since none of them is the boundary ( coboundary ) of a finite sum of plaquettes ( vertices ) .",
    "they generate the two groups , but in both cases there is one relation .",
    "the sum of all @xmath110 generators can be realized as the boundary of the sum of plaquettes ( coboundary of the sum of vertices ) on the sphere on which we have cut the holes .",
    "therefore the ground states can store @xmath118 classical bits .",
    "charged sectors can again be constructed using semi - infinite paths and dual paths .",
    "this time not all of these are equivalent , since any such path will eventually leave every cyilinder but one .",
    "( but not for proper ones ) . ]",
    "taking @xmath110 paths @xmath119 and dual paths @xmath120 going to infinity in the corresponding cylinder gives representatives of independent generators of @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively .",
    "the existence of inequivalent paths gives rise to an interesting phenomenon .",
    "we may assume that @xmath119 start at the same point .",
    "choose @xmath123 from @xmath124 and consider the sum @xmath125 .",
    "this path is infinite in both directions , therefore it has empty boundary , but it is not a boundary of any locally finite @xmath114-chain , i.e. it represents a nontrivial element in @xmath126 . therefore if we create both excitations , then it is not possible to tell the difference by measurements in compact contractible regions .",
    "still , the state changes during this process , as can be seen using the polarization operators .",
    "there is also a phyisical picture behind this .",
    "namely , it is possible to apply logical operations by creating a particle at infinity in one of the cylinders , moving towards the sphere and then again towards infinity , but along some other cylinder .",
    "the same can be done using dual paths .",
    "mathematically , this can be understood using the maps @xmath127 and @xmath128 from the long exact sequences in eqs . and .",
    "the groups @xmath126 and @xmath129 are isomorphic to @xmath130 and are generated by the sums @xmath125 and @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "finally , let us see how polarization operators look like . to each cylinder",
    "one can associate the element of @xmath132 represented by the sum of its vertices and the element of @xmath133 represented by the sum of its plaquettes .",
    "truncating these to the complement of a large finite set of vertices ( plaquettes ) and taking the coboundary ( boundary ) results in a dual path ( path ) around the cylinder , and its expected value counts the number of paths ( dual paths ) in that cylinder attached to localized excitations ( mod 2 ) .    in the examples above , for @xmath134 there are frustration free ground states which give rise to gns representations that are not quasiequivalent to each other .",
    "this is related to the classical information stored in the states .",
    "inequivalent representations can arise in a different way for surfaces with infinite genus . as a simple example consider the surface @xmath135 of a thickened semi - infinite ladder embedded in @xmath109 ( figure [ fig : infinitegenus ] ) .",
    "this surface has one end , it is orientable and has infinite genus . in this case @xmath136 and @xmath137 are isomorphic to the direct sum of countably many copies of @xmath81 , and the pairing between the two is nondegenerate .",
    "therefore @xmath29 is the tensor product of countably many @xmath138 matrix algebras , which has uncountably many pairwise inequivalent irreducible representations .     and of @xmath139 .",
    "[ fig : infinitegenus ] ]      the main motivation behind our studies comes from the homological product code construction . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was suggested that the homological product of the toric code with some fixed css code might support anyonic quasiparticles like the toric code itself .",
    "given that the homological product corresponds to the cartesian product of the underlying topological spaces , and the product of a plane with some other ( nontrivial ) space is no longer a surface , it is natural to consider the problem in our framework , possibly with @xmath140 .",
    "note that a css code does not determine a cw complex uniquely , therefore our starting point will be a finite ( equivalently : compact ) cw complex .    for this construction",
    "we need the following ingredients : a compact cw complex @xmath141 , a natural number @xmath0 and a finite abelian group @xmath8 .",
    "the space on which our system lives will be @xmath142 ( where @xmath98 is equipped with an arbitrary locally finite cw structure , e.g. the one given by the square lattice ) , and we will put a copy of @xmath9 on each @xmath0-cell .",
    "the planar ( abelian ) kitaev model is the special case when @xmath141 is a point and @xmath94 .",
    "the problem of finding frustration free ground states and localized excitations is now reduced to a problem in algebraic topology : we need to understand various homology and cohomology groups of @xmath7 .",
    "this can be done using the long exact sequences ( eqs . and ) .",
    "the result is stated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 3.10 ) , but for the calculations we need an explicit description of the group elements , which we give here .",
    "since @xmath98 is contractible , @xmath143 and @xmath144 for any @xmath11 . there is a canonical isomorphism induced by the homotopy equivalence @xmath145 which is the projection onto the first factor .",
    "its homotopy inverse is the inclusion @xmath146.-cell . ]",
    "the inclusion of the cellular chain complex into the locally finite cellular chain complex induces trivial maps on homology . to see this ,",
