    "we separated the longitudinal and transverse responses on @xmath1c , for 300 @xmath125 570 mev / c , and compared them with the data .",
    "a reasonable overall description of the data , especially those corresponding with low - energy nuclear excitations , is reached .",
    "we calculated @xmath1c(@xmath122 ) cross sections , relevant for accelerator - based neutrino - oscillation experiments .",
    "we illustrated how low - energy nuclear excitations are induced by neutrinos .",
    "we paid special attention to contributions where nuclear - structure details become important , but remain unobserved in rfg - based models .",
    "we show that low - energy excitations can account for non - negligible contributions to the signal of accelerator - based neutrino - oscillation experiments , especially at forward neutrino - nucleus scattering .",
    "we thank luis  alvarez - ruso and teppei  katori for useful discussions .",
    "this research was funded by the interuniversity attraction poles programme initiated by the belgian science policy office , the research foundation flanders ( fwo - flanders ) and by the erasmus mundus external cooperations window s eurindia project .",
