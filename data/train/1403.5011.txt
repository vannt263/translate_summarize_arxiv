    "we have chosen to study a single molecular cloud as the initial chemical composition of each clump should be very similar . obtaining a reliable temperature measurement of each clump will allow us , in future papers , to calculate accurate molecular abundances for comparison between clumps .",

    "there are a variety of star formation stages within the g333 gmc .",
    "this ranges from isolated , compact 160@xmath0  objects , to areas with complex infrared emission and multiple masers .",
    "there also appears to be possible triggered star formation [ e.g. clump  3  ( g333.136@xmath90.431 ) ] . in future papers , we will be combining the molecular and dust information for all 63 clumps identified in this paper , to characterise the clumps in relation to the evolution of star formation within the g333  gmc .",
    "in this paper we have presented data from the two lowest inversion transitions of  in the g333 giant molecular cloud with the 70-m tidbinbilla radio telescope .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    \\(1 ) there were 63 simba 1.2-mm dust clumps identified with clumpfind and pointed  observations were conducted towards the peak of each clump .",
    "the peak of each clump was offset from the clump centroid by between 1.6 and 39.5 arcsec .",
    "\\(2 ) a variety of environments were identified within the g333  gmc and the sample was separated into 30 ir - bright and 33 ir - faint clumps .",
    "one clump from each category was identified via  ( 2,2 )  emission , to not be associated with the @xmath29  of the g333  gmc , and one clump was identified to have an inaccurate @xmath28 ; resulting in 29 ir - bright and 31 ir - faint clumps .",
    "the  ( 1,1 )  and ( 2,2 )  were fitted for 20 ir - bright and 26 ir - faint clumps , with mean @xmath28  values of 24.2k and 19.3k , respectively .",
    "\\(3 ) we found that the clumps appeared to cluster into three regions .",
    "the ir - bright clumps were found predominately towards the centre of each region , especially for regions b and c. this may indicate sequentially triggered star formation in the vicinity around ir - faint clumps .",
    "\\(4 ) using  ( 1,1 )  and ( 2,2 ) , the clump masses were found to be between 278 and 13036 m@xmath1 .",
    "the dust temperature is often assumed : 20k for isolated clumps and 40k for hii  regions ; however this assumption can significantly shift the masses of the clumps ( e.g. for 20k the masses of our clumps were 25123723m@xmath1 , and for 40k the masses of our clumps were 1059951m@xmath1 ) and can affect whether the clump is determined to be bound and will collapse onto itself , or if it is unbound and remains a starless core",
    ". hence accurate measurements of kinetic temperatures are needed for studies of the gravitationally bound state of clumps .",
    "\\(5 ) the largest clumps are also the most unstable .",
    "we find that the clumps with signs of star formation are predominately associated with the least stable clumps .",
    "this may be due to feedback from an internal heating source .",
    "we found that 70  per  cent of the clumps had masses larger than the virial mass ( 1876848m@xmath1 ) , suggesting that they will form stars or are already undergoing star formation .",
    "\\(6 ) a k - s test showed that the @xmath28  for ir - bright and ir - faint clumps have a much smaller probability of being drawn from the same population .",
    "a tentative difference between the two populations in terms of fwhm could indicate a contribution due to feedback .",
    "no difference was seen for the other physical parameters .",
    "we conclude that ir - bright and ir - faint clumps can have the same masses but that the warmer regions are more evolved .",
    "this is the fourth paper in a series of papers utilising molecular line observations of the g333 giant molecular cloud associated with rcw  106 ( g333  gmc ) . in this paper we reported on the selection of dense clumps based on simba dust emission and pointed  ( 1,1 )  and ( 2,2 )  observations towards these clumps .",
    "future papers in the series will analyse the individual clumps and combine the information presented in this paper with the molecular 3-mm tracers presented in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and dust from the _ spitzer _ space telescope and the _ herschel _ space observatory .",
