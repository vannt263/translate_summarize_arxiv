    "fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states are topological quantum fluid phases of two - dimensional electron gases in large magnetic fields .",
    "these incompressible fluid states have universal wave functions , the laughlin wave functions  @xcite and their hierarchical extensions  @xcite , and their associated spectrum of low - energy excitations have universal quantum numbers , such as their charge and statistics .",
    "smooth short - distance changes in the precise form of the electron - electron interactions do not change the universal properties of these ground states and of their low energy spectra . on closed surfaces , the ground states of fqh systems exhibit degeneracies which are a direct manifestation of the topological nature of these fluid states  @xcite .",
    "the universal properties of fqh states can also be described in the form of an effective quantum field theory for the degrees of freedom with energies low compared to the cyclotron energy @xmath0 and/or the coulomb energy @xmath1 ( whichever is smallest ) , and at distances long compared to the magnetic length @xmath2 ( and/or any other short distance scale related to the interaction ) .",
    "the low energy theory of the fqh states is a chern - simons gauge theory .",
    "there are two equivalent , mutually dual , descriptions of this effective theory . in the first",
    ", the chern - simons gauge theory is derived directly from a theory of interacting electrons  @xcite , and the gauge field is the statistical gauge field .",
    "the second description is based on a hydrodynamic picture  @xcite . in this picture",
    "the gauge fields embody the conserved charge densities and currents of the electron fluid .",
    "naturally , both descriptions , which are dual to each other , yield an effective action for slowly varying electromagnetic gauge fields which also has a chern - simons form , a result required by gauge invariance and broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "thus chern - simons gauge field theories appear as the natural field - theoretic description of the low energy physics of fqh states .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , susskind argued that quantum hall systems are inherently non - commutative , and that their effective field theory should be a non - commutative extension of the chern - simons gauge theory . from a heuristic point of view , this is expected , because of the non - commutative magnetic algebra of the quantum mechanics of electrons in a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "thus , when acting on the hilbert space of excitations of an incompressible ( gapped ) state , physical observables such as the charge and current densities , obey a local extension of the magnetic algebra  @xcite , a magnetic current algebra related to the @xmath3 symmetry of area preserving diffeomorphisms  @xcite .",
    "the physical observables of this magnetic current algebra obey moyal products controlled by the magnetic length @xmath4 .",
    "the non - commutative gauge theory that susskind discusses is an effective hydrodynamic theory of the fractional quantum hall states .",
    "thus , as such it describes only the low energy physics of these incompressible fluid states .",
    "it is an extension of the conventional effective chern - simons descriptions which have been used quiet successfully to describe interesting phenomena such as edge states .",
    "susskind s non - commutative hydrodynamics is a natural extension of these theories .",
    "however , susskind s proposal poses a number of questions .",
    "for instance , the non - commutativity of susskind s theory , at the level of the effective action of ref .",
    "@xcite , is controlled not by the magnetic length @xmath4 , but instead by the particle density @xmath5 ( or rather , by the mean separation between the electrons ) .",
    "it is thus natural to inquire what is the connection between susskind s non - commutative chern - simons gauge theory and the magnetic current algebra as they superficially appear to be controlled by different ( although obviously related ) non - commutativity parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "since the non - commutativity happens on such a short - distance scale , it is also necessary to explain in what sense this theory is robust , _",
    "i.e. , _ insensitive to other non - universal short distance physical phenomena not considered in this theory .",
    "for instance , at short distances the particular form of the interaction matters since it is what determines how big the energy gaps are and how fast do the excitations move .",
    "we will see below that what is special about the non - commutativity is that it is the only short distance effect associated with the broken time - reversal symmetry and parity of electrons in magnetic fields , and that in this sense this structure is robust . nevertheless , the effects of non - commutativity show up primarily in non - uniform states and in practice both the time - reversal even and odd processes are important .",
    "for example , it is well known from the classic work of girvin , macdonald and platzman  @xcite that the spectrum of collective modes with a finite length scale , such as the roton modes , is due to a combination of the magnetic algebra and electron - electron interaction effects .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a complementary derivation of susskind s result , based directly on the field theory of interacting electrons coupled to gauge fields .",
    "our calculation is an extension of the standard methods of ref .",
    "@xcite , which were used before to derive the conventional chern - simons effective gauge theory and the universal physics they contain : the values of the quantum hall conductivity for which the fqh state is stable , the ground state degeneracy , and the quantum numbers of the excitations . here",
    "we will show that a non - commutative chern - simons gauge theory emerges naturally within this framework .",
    "we will find that to lowest order of approximation , the non - commutativity parameter does not agree with the one found by susskind .",
    "however , we will show that susskind s result is required by the constraints imposed by the magnetic current algebra of the charge densities and currents .",
    "hence , higher order quantum corrections lead to finite renormalizations of the effective non - commutativity parameter .",
    "in contrast the level of the chern - simons theory is not renormalized beyond its gaussian value , due to the constraints of topological and gauge invariance , and incompressibility .",
    "we will show that these results are universal in the sense that these are the only effects at this length scale which are odd under time - reversal ( and parity ) .    throughout the paper",
    ", we shall use the following notation : @xmath6 the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : hydro ] , we briefly review susskind s fluid dynamics derivation of non - commutative chern - simons theory for the laughlin fqh states . in section [ sec : cs ] , we review the derivation of commutative abelian chern - simons theory for the fqh states in the jain sequences , based on the notion of flux attachment , as the effective field theory of fqh states . in section [ sec : calc ] , we present the results of our calculation of the effective gauge field action , obtained by integrating out fermions .",

    "the non - commutativity is controlled here by the parameter @xmath30 .",
    "if we couple this to the electromagnetic potential and compute the hall conductance , we find that the filling fraction is given by @xmath31 .",

    "@xcite , the effective action of eq .",

    "we will now use this description of interacting electrons in magnetic fields to give a derivation of susskind s non - commutative hydrodynamics .",

    "fluctuations about this mean - field state play a key role .",
    "now , if we integrate out the fermions , _",
    "i.e. _ we sum over all current configurations including the effects of the fermion phase factor as well as interaction effects , we will clearly obtain an effective action for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the fluctuating pieces of the statistical gauge field @xmath54 and the hydrodynamic gauge field @xmath48 .",

    "the details of this calculation are given explicitly by lopez and fradkin in ref.@xcite .",
    "they computed the leading quadratic term in @xmath64 , which amounts to a calculation of the polarization tensor of electrons filling up @xmath61 effective landau levels .",

    "i.e. _ the @xmath78-sum rule , as discussed in refs.@xcite",
    ".    the coefficient of the chern - simons action is known as the chern - simons level .",
    "general topological consistency arguments  @xcite show that if the theory is quantized on a closed manifold , the level of a chern - simons action must be quantized for the theory to be invariant under large gauge transformations .",
    "this requirement is met by the effective action of eq.([eq : zboth ] ) , which contains both the statistical and the hydrodynamic gauge fields , but not by either the effective action for the statistical field or the hydrodynamic field alone except for the laughlin sequence , @xmath75 .",
    "we will return to this issue in the context of the non - commutative theory in section [ sec : ncdual ] .",
    "hence , to quadratic order in fluctuations and at long distances , one finds a commutative abelian chern - simons gauge theory .",
    "we will investigate now the trilinear terms in this expansion .",
    "we have seen that to quadratic order in @xmath64 , and to lowest order in a gradient expansion , the effective action for a laughlin fqh state and its abelian generalizations is a ( commutative ) abelian chern - simons theory .",

    "we are being selective in keeping the momentum dependent phase .",
    "to be fully consistent we should expand the exponential and group the momenta into higher derivative corrections .",

    "the resulting effective action still satisfies the quantization condition of the level of its chern - simons terms .    however , there are a number of features of this result that seem to be wrong .",
    "although this effective theory is non - commutative , the non - commutativity is associated with the statistical gauge field @xmath96 instead of the hydrodynamic gauge field @xmath65 as in susskind s action .",
    "in addition , the level of the non - commutative gauge theory is @xmath61 instead of the denominator of the filling factor as suggested by ref .",
    "likewise , the length scale of the non - commutativity is neither the average particle separation as in susskind s action nor the magnetic length @xmath4 as required by the magnetic current algebra , but instead the effective magnetic length @xmath68",

    "@xcite , that unlike other mean field theories , for fractional quantum hall states , quantum fluctuations even at the gaussian level , _ restore _ some of the symmetries broken by the the mean field state .",
    "physically this happens since , due to the gauss law constraint of the chern - simons theory , a local density fluctuation is equivalent to a local flux fluctuation . in particular , the leading quantum corrections , described by the gaussian commutative effective action , yield upon integrating out the gauge fields @xmath54 and @xmath48 , the correct electromagnetic polarization tensor which saturates the @xmath78-sum rule in the @xmath120 regime and thus it is exact in this limit  @xcite .",
    "hence , in the uniform limit this theory predicts , for the jain states with filling factor @xmath121 , a hall conductivity equal to @xmath122 , a cyclotron mode with frequency @xmath123 and residue @xmath124 , a spectrum of quasiholes carrying charge @xmath125 and fractional statistics @xmath126 , and , for a surface of genus @xmath127 , a ground state degeneracy of @xmath128 .",
    "thus the ( gaussian ) commutative chern - simons effective action of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zboth ] ) yields a complete description of the universal long - distance data of fractional quantum hall states ( for a recent discussion see ref .",
    "( this is no longer the case when the gap collapses as in the limiting states @xmath129 , which are compressible states of the 2deg  @xcite . )",
    "let us see what this line of analysis implies for the non - commutative effective theory of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zboth ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - nc ] ) .",
    "we noted before that in the @xmath130 limit the gaussian theory is exact .",
    "however , in this regime the theory is commutative .",
    "although at shorter distances , the physics of the 2deg is strongly non - universal , we showed above that in the odd - parity sector , the theory becomes non - commutative .",
    "however , the length scale of the non - commutativity is @xmath68 which is not a physical length scale .",
    "this inconsistency has exactly the same origin as the violation of the global magnetic symmetry .",
    "as before , this inconsistency is also resolved by quantum corrections to the mean field state .    to understand this problem , let us look first at the actual electromagnetic currents @xmath131 in the system .",
    "( as usual , this is a @xmath34-vector formed by the physical charge density fluctuation and the two components of the charge current . )",
    "these currents are obtained as from the effective action for the external electromagnetic gauge field @xmath106=-\\log z[\\tilde a_\\mu]$ ] , where @xmath132 $ ] is the partition function of the full 2deg and @xmath71 is a weak electromagnetic perturbation . in 1992 ,",
    "iso , karabali and sakita  @xcite , and independently martinez and stone  @xcite , showed that the electromagnetic currents and charge densities for a 2deg in a large magnetic field @xmath7 , in an incompressible state with filling factor @xmath59 , obey a @xmath133 algebra , which is a local extension of the global magnetic algebra of finite translation operators in a magnetic field .",
    "let @xmath134 be the charge density operator _",
    "projected on the lowest landau level _ , and @xmath135 be its fourier transform @xmath136 these authors  @xcite showed that the projected density operators obey the algebra @xmath137=-2i \\sin\\left(\\ell^2(pq'-p'q)/2\\right)\\ ; e^{\\ell^2(pp'+qq')/2 } \\hat\\rho(p+p',q+q')\\ ] ] in the holomorphic basis @xmath138 the algebra becomes @xmath139=\\sum_{j=1}^{{\\rm min } ( n , k ) } \\frac{(-1)^j}{j ! }",
    "\\frac{n!k!}{(n - j)!(k - j ) ! } \\hat \\rho_{m+k - j , n+l - j}-(n \\leftrightarrow l ) ( m \\leftrightarrow k)\\ ] ] hence , the algebra of the charge density operators  @xcite , as well as of the current density operators as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , contains explicitly a moyal product controlled by the magnetic length scale @xmath4 of the full magnetic field @xmath7 .",
    "this is a very general result which follows from the incompressibility of the system and from the properties of the quantum states in a magnetic field .",
    "this result poses important constraints , which can be regarded as ward identities , on the values of the parameters of the effective action @xmath106 $ ] of an external _ electromagnetic field _ in an incompressible quantum hall state .",
    "in addition to the condition of gauge invariance , which follows from current conservation , these results _ require _ that for a fractional quantum hall state at filling factor @xmath59 , the effective action @xmath106 $ ] must have the form of a non - commutative chern - simons action whose level is @xmath59 ( in units of @xmath140 ) and whose non - commutativity parameter @xmath141 , where @xmath7 is the full magnetic field . as we saw above , this requirement in turn",
    "implies that the non - commutativity scale for the hydrodynamic field is @xmath142 , where @xmath5 is the average areal density .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the higher orders in perturbation theory , among other things , must necessarily renormalize the non - commutativity parameter of the hydrodynamic field to this exact value .",
    "in this paper we have used the notion of flux attachment to derive susskind s non - commutative hydrodynamic action for the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "we have presented two mutually dual effective theories , which are non - commutative extensions of the familiar ( commutative ) chern - simons descriptions of the fqhe .",
    "we have used this duality to show that while the hydrodynamic effective action must have a non - commutative parameter controlled by the average particle distance ( as in susskind s action ) , the effective action of the electromagnetic field must have a non - commutative parameter controlled only by the magnetic length .",
    "we have also shown that while mean - field - like approximations do lead to effective actions with the correct form of a non - commutative chern - simons theory , the non - commutativity parameter is not correct at lowest order and must acquire corrections in order to satisfy the constraints imposed by the global magnetic algebra , and its local ( moyal ) extension .",
    "this is in marked contrast with the hall conductivity which is already correct at the level of the gaussian theory .",
    "we would like to comment on the validity and usefulness of these non - commutative effective theories .",
    "clearly the commutative abelian chern - simons theory gives a faithful description of the universal data encoded in fractional quantum hall fluids : the hall conductivity , the fractional charge and statistics of the excitations and the global topological degeneracy of their ground states .",
    "the non - commutative theory describes the local extension of the global magnetic algebra , _",
    "i.  e. _ the @xmath3 algebra of the local currents and densities of incompressible charged two - dimensional fluids in large magnetic fields . in fact , as argued by susskind , non - commutative chern - simons theory is a description of the area - preserving diffeomorphisms of these incompressible fluids . hence , in a sense , except for the universal quantum numbers they encode , the information contained in these effective theories is essentially kinematic in nature .",
    "indeed , there is much _ dynamics _ taking place at the scale of the magnetic ( and coulomb ) lengths , such as the energetics of the excitations , which is not described by these effective theories .",
    "although in a formal sense this is an inconsistency , what matters here is that the non - commutative terms included are the only contributions at these length scales which are odd under parity and time - reversal .",
    "obviously a full description of the physics requires the ( strongly non - universal ) microscopic physics which controls the energetics of these states .",
    "these considerations are particularly important for applications of these ideas to non - uniform ground states such as wigner crystals , quantum hall smectic and nematic states ( for recent work see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "recent work on these interesting phases of the two - dimensional electron gas has revealed that magnetic symmetry plays a crucial role in low - energy dynamics of these states .",
    "interestingly , recent work on non - commutative field theories has suggested that their phase diagrams involve analogs of these phases  @xcite .",
    "it remains an important and open problem to understand the implications and restrictions imposed by the non - commutative structure on the phase transitions between these states  @xcite .",

    "we choose a gauge such that @xmath154 where @xmath155 .",
    "these derivatives have the effect of shifting the indices of the landau functions : @xmath156 where we have introduced constants @xmath157 and @xmath158 , whose non - zero components are : @xmath159 in the three - point feynman diagrams ( figs . [ fig:3ptboth.eps ] ) , for each spatial component of a gauge field that appears at an external leg , there is a spatial derivative of the form given above acting on the fermion lines .",
    "if we sum over all such possibilities , the net effect on a vertex is to replace its landau functions by a factor @xmath160 it is not difficult to show that @xmath161 @xmath162 is essentially the `` fourier transformed '' three point vertex of @xmath163 .",

    "to proceed further , we need to evaluate the rather complicated sums in eq .",
    "( [ eq : result ] ) .",
    "we will do so by expanding in energies and momenta ( keeping the overall moyal phase intact ) .",
    "we find that there is a non - zero contribution to the parity odd polarization @xmath181}(p_1,p_2,p_3)=\\frac { p}{2\\pi } e^{\\displaystyle{-i\\ell_{\\rm eff}^2 \\ ; p_1\\wedge p_2/2 } }   \\ ; \\ ; f ( p_1 ^ 2,p_2 ^ 2)\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is a regular function of the momenta @xmath90 and @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
