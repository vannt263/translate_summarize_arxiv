    "in starburst galaxies , a large number of massive stars ( e.g. , @xmath7 ) are formed within a short duration ( weedman et al . 1981 ; balzano 1983 ; taniguchi et al .",
    "therefore , a burst of supernova explosions occurs inevitably @xmath8 years after the onset of the starburst .",
    "since these numerous supernovae release a huge amount of kinetic energy into the circumnuclear gas , the circumnuclear gas is thermalized and then blow out into the direction perpendicular to the galactic disk as a `` superwind '' ( tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ; heckman , armus , & miley 1990 ; suchkov et al .",
    "1994 ) . a bubble of the ionized gas sweeps up the circumnuclear molecular gas , leading to the formation of molecular - gas superwind as well as the ionized - gas one ( tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ; suchkov et al .",
    "thus , in order to understand the whole physical processes of superwinds , it is important to investigate the nature of molecular - gas superwinds ( e.g. , nakai et al .",
    "1987 ; aalto et al . 1994",
    "; irwin & sofue 1996 ) .    in this _ letter _ ,",
    "we present new evidence for the molecular - gas superwind from the wolf - rayet starburst galaxy mrk 1259 , which shows the optical evidence for the superwind viewed from a nearly pole - on view ( ohyama , taniguchi , & terlevich 1997 ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "mrk 1259 is a peculiar s0 galaxy ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ; hereafter rc3 ) at a distance of 26.64 mpc . mpc .",
    "however , @xmath9 was misused instead of @xmath10 in this estimate . in this _",
    "letter _ , using @xmath11 km s@xmath3 ( rc3 ) , with a hubble constant @xmath12 = 75 km s@xmath3 mpc @xmath3 , we adopt a distance @xmath13 = 26.64 mpc .",
    "therefore , the heii@xmath144686 luminosity , the number of late wr ( wrl ) stars , the size of the superwind , and the average velocity of the superwind in paper i should be read as @xmath15(heii ) = 7.0@xmath16 erg s@xmath3 , @xmath17(wrl ) @xmath4 4100 , @xmath18(superwind ) @xmath19 kpc , and the average wind velocity @xmath4 565 km s@xmath3 , respectively . ]",
    "the logarithmic major - to - minor diameter ratio , log @xmath20 ( rc3 ) , gives a nominal inclination angle , @xmath21 , and the galaxy appears to be elongated along the ew direction .",
    "if this elongation were attributed to the inclination , we would observe the rotational motion along the ew direction .",
    "however , our long slit optical spectrum along the ew direction which was analyzed in paper i shows no hint on the rotational motion ; @xmath22 km s@xmath3 , suggesting strongly that the galaxy is seen from an almost face - on view .",
    "therefore the oval shape of mrk 1259 may not be due to the inclination .",
    "the @xmath0co ( @xmath1 - 0 ) observations of mrk 1259 were made using the 45 m radio telescope at nobeyama radio observatory , equipped with an sis100 receiver in february 1997 .",
    "the observations were made in the midnight under little wind velocity .",
    "pointing check was made in every 30 minutes and the pointing errors in our observations are smaller than a few arcsec .",
    "the half power beam width ( hpbw ) is 15 arcsec at 115 ghz , corresponding to @xmath4 2 kpc at the distance of mrk 1259 .",
    "we observed the radio center position [ @xmath23 ; @xmath24 ; sramek & weedman ( 1986 ) ] and four off - nuclear positions ( 15@xmath25n , 15@xmath25w , 15@xmath25s , and 15@xmath25e ) . the main beam efficiency ( @xmath26 ) was 0.51 at 115 ghz .",
    "the backend was the 2048 channel wide - band acousto optical spectrometer operated with the band width of 250 mhz , covering a velocity range of 650 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the final data were box - car averaged , resulting in a final velocity resolution of 5 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the final spectra are shown in figure 1 .",
    "in table 1 , we give a summary of our observational results .",
    "the integrated co intensity was estimated by @xmath27 k km s@xmath3 where @xmath28 . using a galactic conversion factor , @xmath29 @xmath30 ( k km s@xmath3)@xmath3 ( scoville et al .",
    "1987 ) , we estimate the molecular gas mass , @xmath31 , in each position where @xmath32 is the projected area of a 15@xmath25 hpbw in units of kpc@xmath33 . for the off - nuclear regions ,",
    "we also give total values of @xmath34(co ) and @xmath35 .",
    "the total molecular gas mass detected in our observations amounts to @xmath36 .",
    "since we do not observe the entire disk of this galaxy , this mass is regarded as a lower limit .",
    "the nuclear co emission shows a single - peaked profile with the evident blueward asymmetry . applying a two - component gaussian profile fitting ( see the midst panel of figure 1 ) , we obtain the blueshifted broad component with fwhm @xmath4 114 km s@xmath3 and the narrow one with fwhm @xmath4 68 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the peak velocity of the broad component is blueshifted by 27 km s@xmath3 with respect to that of the narrow one ( table 1 ) .",
    "both the intensities are nearly the same .",
    "we also mention that the red wing can not be seen in the nuclear co profile .    even though there is the broad co emission component ,",
    "its width is significantly narrower than those observed for typical starburst galaxies ; e.g. , fwhm(co ) @xmath4 200 - 250 km s@xmath3 for m82 ( young & scoville 1984 ; nakai et al .",
    "1987 ) , @xmath37 km s@xmath3 for ngc 1808 ( aalto et al .",
    "1994 ) , and @xmath38 km s@xmath3 for ngc 4945 ( dahlem et al .",
    "this difference can be attributed to the effect of viewing angles between mrk 1259 and the other starburst galaxies .",
    "it is remembered that the co line width is generally affected by the galactic rotation .",
    "given a typical rotation velocity of a disk galaxy , @xmath39 km s@xmath3 , the observed full widths would amount to 2@xmath40 400 km s@xmath3 if seen from the edge - on view .",
    "in fact , since we observe m82 , ngc 1808 , and ngc 4945 from highly inclined viewing angles , their line widths are considered to be broadened by the effect of galactic rotation . on the other hand ,",
    "since mrk 1259 appears to be a nearly face - on galaxy , the observed width is not affected by the galactic rotation .",
    "irwin & sofue ( 1996 ) suggested that one of the nearby superwind galaxies , ngc 3628 , has a nuclear molecular gas disk with a velocity dispersion of @xmath41 100 km s@xmath3 .",
    "if mrk 1259 has also such a nuclear gas disk , we can explain the velocity width of the nuclear co emission .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that the observed fwhm of mrk 1259 is due mainly to the broadening by some dynamical effect of the starburst activity .",
    "the blueward asymmetry of the nuclear co line profile suggests that the co gas is affected significantly by the superwind .",
    "the detection of the off - nuclear co emission from mrk 1259 is very intriguing from the following two points .",
    "the first point is that the host galaxy of mrk 1259 appears to be an s0 galaxy ( rc3 ) .",
    "it is often observed that early type galaxies such as s0 and elliptical galaxies tend to have less molecular gas ( e.g. , young & scoville 1991 ) although co emission has been detected from a number of s0 galaxies ( thronson et al .",
    "1989 ; wiklind & henkel 1989 ; sage 1989 ; sage & wrobel 1989 ) .",
    "it is also known that the molecular gas in ( non - active ) s0 galaxies tends to be concentrated in the region whose diameter is typically less than one tenth of the optical diameter ( taniguchi et al .",
    "if this is also the case for mrk 1259 , the molecular gas would be concentrated within the central @xmath42 region where @xmath43 is the isophotal optical diameter ( rc3 ) .",
    "therefore , the presence of the bright off - nuclear co emission is one of very important characteristics of mrk 1259 .",
    "the second point is that the line widths of the off - nuclear co emission are comparable to that of the nuclear co emission , fwhm @xmath6 km s@xmath3 .",
    "if there were an inclined off - nuclear co disk , we may explain the wide line width because of the velocity gradient in the disk .",
    "if this is the case , we would observe that the peak velocity at 15@xmath25e is significantly different from that at 15@xmath25w .",
    "however , since our observations show that the velocity field of the off - nuclear regions is almost symmetric , this possibility is rejected .",
    "the second possibility is that there are spatially extended starburst regions and a significant amount of molecular gas is associated with them .",
    "however , radio continuum ( 1.5 ghz and 5 ghz ) images show that the starburst region of mrk 1259 is concentrated in the central several arcsec region ( r. a. sramek 1997 , private communication ) .",
    "therefore , there is no observational evidence for active star forming regions in the off - nuclear regions .",
    "as described before , we are observing the disk of mrk 1259 from nearly a face - on view and thus the co line width would be as narrow as @xmath41 10 km s@xmath3 if mrk 1259 were a normal disk galaxy ( lewis 1984 , 1987 ; kamphuis & sancisi 1993 ) .",
    "if there were an extended molecular gas disk with a velocity dispersion of @xmath41 100 km s@xmath3 up to a radius of a few kpc , we could explain the wide line width .",
    "however , the size of the nuclear gas disk in ngc 3628 is much smaller ( @xmath44 pc , or @xmath45 ) than the off - nuclear distance of mrk 1259 ( @xmath46 kpc , or @xmath47 ) .",
    "although we can not rule out the possibility that mrk 1259 has such a very extended molecular gas disk with a large velocity dispersion , we need further detailed molecular - line observations to confirm this possibility .",
    "the third possibility is that the off - nuclear co gas is associated with the superwind ( i.e. , blown out from the nuclear region ) .",
    "since the ionized - gas superwind is extended to @xmath48 kpc ( paper i ) , this possibility seems to be quite high .",
    "in fact , such extended co emission is detected in m82 at the scale of 600 pc ( nakai et al .",
    "1987 ) and even at the larger scale ( @xmath46 kpc ; sofue et al .",
    "we discuss this possibility in detail in the next section .",
    "since the superwind of mrk 1259 is observed from nearly the pole - on view , it is interesting to investigate both the velocity field and the geometry of the superwind . in order to perform this ,",
    "we investigate the off - nuclear co line profile using a simple biconical outflow model in which the superwind flows toward the polar directions symmetrically with its apex at the nucleus .",
    "such a superwind geometry is expected theoretically by hydrodynamical numerical simulations ( suchkov et al .",
    "1994 ) and indeed observed in m82 ( e.g. , nakai et al . 1987 ) . in our model , we assume that the molecular gas can only move along the cone surface .",
    "we assume that the axis of the cone lies along our line of sight .",
    "the full opening angle of the cone ( @xmath49 ) is not well constrained by the observations because of its nearly face - on viewing angle .",
    "therefore we take this as a free parameter although paper i has suggested as @xmath50 .",
    "a mean tangential velocity of the ionized gas on the sky can be estimated as @xmath51 kpc@xmath52 years)@xmath53 km s@xmath3 where @xmath54 is the projected radius of the superwind and @xmath55 is the age of the superwind ( paper i ) .",
    "we note that the outflow velocity of the molecular gas is _ slower _ than that of the ionized gas because the molecular gas along the cone surface is _ dragged _ by the ionized gas , rather than directly _ pushed out _",
    "( suchkov et al . 1994 ) .",
    "for example , the model a1 of suchkov et al .",
    "( 1994 ) shows that the velocity of the outflowing dense gas is slower by a factor of @xmath56 than that of the ionized gas at the age of 8.3 myr .",
    "in fact , comparing the outflow velocity of the ionized gas ( heckathorn 1972 ) with that of the molecular gas ( nakai et al .",
    "1987 ) of m82 , we find that the outflow velocity of the molecular gas is slower by a factor of @xmath57 than that of the ionized - gas .",
    "thus , the mean tangential velocity of the molecular gas on the sky can be @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the decelerating factor ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we examine if the model can explain the observed co line profiles in the off - nuclear regions .",
    "no effect of radiative transfer is included in the model calculation .",
    "we assume that the size of the cone is large enough to cover the whole off - nuclear regions . for simplicity",
    ", we also assume that the velocity field has a power - law form ; i.e. , @xmath61 , with a boundary condition of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 kpc ) = 410 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the emissivity ( strength of the co emission per a unit area ) is also assumed to have a power - law form ; i.e. , @xmath64 .",
    "although the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 are not well constrained by the observations , we adopt @xmath67 and @xmath68 as representative values following the trend seen in m82 ( nakai et al .",
    "we calculate the model for the cases of @xmath69 , and @xmath70 and @xmath59 = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "to explain the observed fwzi ( full width at zero intensity ) of the off - nuclear co emission ( @xmath71 km s@xmath3 ; see figure 1 ) , we find that only models with ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) and ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) are acceptable .",
    "models with @xmath76 and @xmath70 can not reproduce the line width for any @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , we show our results only for the cases @xmath77 and @xmath78 and @xmath59 = 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 in figure 2 .",
    "our simple model demonstrates that the co line has always a double - peaked profile for any combinations of the parameters .",
    "the red peak corresponds to the recessing cone while the blue one corresponds to the advancing cone . on the other hand ,",
    "our observations show that the off - nuclear co lines have smooth profiles around at the systemic velocity .",
    "we discuss why our simple model can not reproduce the observed off - nuclear co profiles .",
    "one possible idea is a `` swirl''-like velocity field which is often found in the hydrodynamical numerical simulations ( tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ; suchkov et al . 1994 ) .",
    "if the outflow actually shows such a complex geometry and/or velocity field , it is expected that some parts of the emission would contribute to the core emission and can explain the broad and smooth off - nuclear emission . in order to understand the molecular - gas superwind of mrk 1259 , detailed molecular - line observations with higher spatial resolution would be helpful .    we would like to thank the staff of nobeyama radio observatory for their kind support for our observations .",
    "we thank naomasa nakai for useful discussion and encouragement and takashi murayama and shingo nishiura for kind assistance of the observations .",
    "we also thank r. a. sramek for kindly providing us his vla data .",
