    "the experimental achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in dilute alkali atoms @xcite , spin - polarized hydrogen @xcite and recently in metastable helium @xcite has enormously stimulated the theoretical research @xcite on the ultracold bosons . among the several intriguing questions on the statistical properties of trapped interacting bose gases , the problem of condensate fluctuations @xmath2 of the mean ground state occupation number @xmath3 is of central importance .",
    "apart from the intrinsic theoretical interest , it is foreseeable that such fluctuations will become experimentally testable in the near future @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculations of @xmath4 are crucial to investigate the phase collapse time of the condensate @xcite .",
    "it is well known that within a grand canonical ensemble the fluctuations of the condensate are given by @xmath5 , implying that @xmath6 becomes of order @xmath7 when the temperature approaches zero .",
    "to avoid this sort of unphysically large condensate fluctuations , a canonical ( or a microcanonical ) ensemble has to be used to investigate the fluctuations of the condensate . on the other hand , because in the experiment the trapped atoms are cooled continuously from the surrounding , the system can be taken as being in contact with a heat bath but the total number of particles in the system is conserved .",
    "thus it is necessary to use the canonical ensemble to investigate the statistical properties of the trapped weakly interacting bose gas .    within the canonical as well as the microcanonical ensembles ,",
    "the condensate fluctuations have been studied systematically in the case of an ideal bose gas in a box @xcite , and in the presence of a harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "recently , the question of how interatomic interactions affect the condensate fluctuations has been an object of several theoretical investigations @xcite .",

    "although the condensate fluctuations are thoroughly investigated in ref.@xcite , to best our knowledge up to now an analytical description of the probability distribution function for the interacting bose gas directly from the microscopic statistics of the system has not been given .",
    "note that as soon as the probability distribution function of the system is obtained , it is straightforward to get the mean ground state occupation number and the condensate fluctuations .",
    "the purpose of the present work is an attempt to provide such an analytical description of the probability distribution function of interacting and non - interacting bose gases based on the analysis of the partition function of the system .",
    "we shall investigate in this paper the condensate fluctuations of interacting and non - interacting bose gases confined in a harmonic trap .",
    "the analytical probability distribution function of the condensate will be given directly from the partition function of the system using a canonical ensemble approach .",
    "for an ideal bose gas , we find that the probability distribution of the condensate is a gaussian function .",
    "in particular , our method can be easily extended to discuss the probability distribution function for a weakly interacting bose gas . a unified way is given to calculate the condensate fluctuations from the lowest - order perturbation theory and from bogoliubov theory .",
