    "the surface tension of water , @xmath0 $ ] , is considered to be a static value after the equilibrium of the rearrangement of the molecules at surface is attained .",
    "the structure of surface orientation @xcite of water molecules is not yet well - defined , though the simulations using molecular dynamics @xcite have been studied .",
    "this may be one reason that the theoretical calculation of surface tension of water which explains the static value has not yet been reported .",
    "theoretical treatments of the surface tension have been done for nonpolar van der waals molecules by statistical mechanics , or by using intermolecular forces involving hamaker constant on the basis of the lifshitz theory@xcite,@xcite .",
    "these results showed considerably good agreement with experimental values of nonpolar materials .",
    "however , theoretical calculation for the polar molecules seems to be hampered by the difficulty of evaluation of surface orientation . on the other hand ,",
    "the surface tension of water is known to have higher value than the static one for freshly created surface .",
    "this has been shown by the dynamical measurement by the oscillating jet method @xcite , where a value of @xmath1 $ ] is observed immediately after the surface is created , and gradually lowers to its static value within less than @xmath2 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the higher value is thought to originate from the freshly exposed water surface where the molecules are not completely reoriented .",
    "we here focused on the calculation of the unoriented surface tension of water based on the dipole interaction model .",
    "the calculation of the contribution of additional terms of intermolecular forces are also presented .",
    "the surface energy which is defined as the ( positive ) energy per area of the surface , is equivalent to the energy for creation of the surface .",
    "the surface energy originates from the binding energy between molecules .",
    "one molecule inside bulk is surrounded by other molecules .",
    "let us define the number of such molecules ( number of nearest neighbour ) as @xmath3 , and the mean binding energy @xmath4 between nearest two molecules .",
    "then the binding energy per one molecule is    @xmath5    on the other hand , the molecule on the surface is surrounded by less neighbours @xmath6 . then the binding energy per molecule is    @xmath7    therefore the molecule on surface has larger energy than that inside bulk .",
    "@xmath8    by using @xmath9 $ ] as molecule number density on surface , we define the surface energy per area .",
    "@xmath10    in the above discussion we considered only the nearest neighbour interaction .",
    "however , we must consider the long range force like van der waals and dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "for this purpose , our method for calculating the surface energy is as follows .    1 .",
    "consider the virtual flat surface in bulk which divide bulk into two pieces .",
    "calculate the binding energy of two molecules .",
    "sum up the binding energies for all molecule - pairs across the virtual surface in bulk .",
    "4 .   the binding energy obtained above divided by two times surface area gives the surface energy per area .",
    "we will calculate the surface energy of water due to above procedure in the following sections .",
    "the surface tension @xmath11 which we observe is defined by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the surface energy ( per area ) , and @xmath14 is the entropy density per area .",
    "this shows our calculation does not directly connect to observable @xmath11 . however , the surface entropy term is far possible to take into account our consideration , since it deeply relates with surface orientation .",
    "we just assume here the surface entropy term is much smaller than the surface energy @xmath13",

    "this phenomenon is usually explained by the surface orientation .",
    "the water molecules on the surface rotate and to make its surface free energy ( surface tension ) minimum during this period . since we can not take into account the surface orientation from technical reason , we need to improve the approximation beyond the nearest - neighbour s one and to obtain the value @xmath89 $ ] as the surface tension .",
    "this is discussed in the next section .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the form of binding energy is complicated even for one molecule - pair interaction , and it seems quite difficult to consider the theory beyond the nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "furthermore , since the potential energy between two dipoles has the form of @xmath91 , the sum of the potential energies diverges logarithmically .",
    "therefore we give an important hypothesis , that is , we utilise thermal expectation value of dipole - dipole interaction energy as an elementary potential energy , and to sum up these energies for all the molecule pairs across the surface ( see fig.5 ) .",
