    "interfaces in complex transition metal oxide heterostructures can play an important role for their physical properties @xcite .",
    "this is especially important for heterostructures which contain nm - thick films deposited on structurally compatible substrate layers .",
    "the lattice mismatch and the charge polarity due to structural discontinuities at a film - substrate interface are the driving forces of interfacial reconstruction which changes dramatically the interface electronic state and possibly the physical behavior of the entire film .",
    "the character of such a reconstruction can range from purely electronic to mixed electronic - lattice .",
    "the electronic reconstruction occurs through a compensation of the interface polarity by charge self - doping .",
    "in addition , the lattice relaxation can modify the band structure ( jahn - teller like effect ) and redistribute the charge between the electronic levels with consequent changes of the electronic properties of the system .",
    "besides the interface region , the film surfaces frequently undergo a surface reconstruction . for the surfaces of transition metal oxides ,",
    "this reconstruction can be related to an electron depletion of @xmath3-orbitals accompanied by lattice contraction , a process observed on several surfaces like for instance at pt(111 ) @xcite .",
    "the charge compensation at the surface can also proceed via a formation of oxygen vacancies which bring extra positive charge into the top layer . in both cases",
    ", the lattice relaxation and polarization plays a key role and leads to changes of chemical bonding and covalencies of surface ions @xcite .",
    "an example of a film - substrate heterostructure , which exhibits a combination of surface and interface reconstruction , is a system of a laalo@xmath0 film on top of a srtio@xmath0 substrate .",
    "this bilayer attracted much attention recently due to the discovered transition between metallic and insulating properties @xcite , possible interface magnetism @xcite and superconductivity @xcite .",
    "electrostatic tuning of the charge carriers allows to switch between superconducting and insulating state  @xcite .",
    "a nanoscale control of the interfacial properties has been achieved  @xcite and nanoelectronics has become feasible  @xcite .    in laalo@xmath0srtio@xmath0-heterostructures , a several unit - cell thick laalo@xmath0 ( lao ) film",
    "is grown on a mm - thick srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) substrate . due to the extremely small thickness of the lao film , the top surface states",
    "are almost directly coupled to the interface .",
    "this coupling leads to a new cooperative mechanism of reconstruction which involves both surface and interface electron states . as a consequence of such a combination",
    ", one may expect a strong dependence of the physical properties on the thickness of the lao film .",
    "in fact , experiments @xcite with lao - sto give clear evidence of an abrupt increase of the carrier concentration and conductivity in heterostructures with lao - tio@xmath2 interfaces of @xmath4-type and alo@xmath2 termination of the lao film .",
    "these abrupt changes have a character of a transition between insulating and metallic states which occurs upon an increase of the lao - thickness above a critical value of 3 unit cells in the direction perpendicular to the interface .",
    "as the pure electronic compensation of the interface polarity would result in 0.5 electrons in the interfacial region and in metallic properties , the insulating character of the system with the ultrathin lao film suggests that other reconstruction mechanisms , different from the purely electronic , play a dominant role .    in this work",
    ", we present the results of electronic structure calculations of lao - sto superlattices .",
    "the structure of model superlattices contains the bilayers of lao and sto with a slab of vacuum on top of the lao layer , a structure which closely resembles the experimentally studied lao - sto heterostructures . to understand better the surface reconstruction",
    ", we compare our results with calculations for a sandwich - type sto - lao - sto superlattice where an lao unit cell is directly connected to the tio@xmath2-terminated sto layers . in the analysis of the lattice degrees of freedom , we perform a full structural relaxation of the considered systems which includes the optimization of the lattice constants and of the atomic positions in supercells . in our calculations , we employ the sic variant of lsda+@xmath5 @xcite on grids containing from ( @xmath6 ) to ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8-points where the additional corrections due to coulomb repulsion on @xmath9 orbitals of ti ( @xmath10  ev ) and @xmath11 orbitals of la ( @xmath12  ev ) are included , according to estimates in ref .  .",
    "as appears from our analysis of the tio@xmath2-lao interface stack , the reconstruction in sto - lao - sto sandwiches differs from that in sto - lao bilayers .",
    "the reason is the significance of the additional distortions in the near - surface planes of lao in the bilayers , whereas in sandwiches we find only small atomic displacements in the interface lao layers .",
    "moreover , the reconstruction of sto - lao bilayers depends on the type of surface termination of the lao film .",
    "below we consider the consequences of the surface termination .",
    "we will see that , despite similar tio@xmath2-lao interface stacking , the structural relaxation in all these systems leads to qualitatively different properties which demonstrates the key role of the lattice reconstruction .",
    "it is well established in the literature  @xcite that for the polar ( lao)@xmath13(tio@xmath2)@xmath14 interfaces , the `` polar catastrophe '' can be prevented by an electronic reconstruction mechanism@xcite . in sandwiches lao / sto / lao/@xmath15 with lao terminated by a lao plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , electronic reconstruction results in @xmath16 electrons per interface unit cell required to maintain the overall neutrality of the system .",
    "it is remarkable that the negative `` extra charge '' is located mostly in the ti @xmath9 orbitals .",
    "@xcite    = 8.5 cm    in the analysis of heterostructures which contain srtio@xmath0 with its incipient ferroelectric properties , one also has to take into account the lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "due to the high polarizability of the titanates , the charge polarity at interface regions will inevitably induce local atomic distortions .",
    "the resulting atomic relaxations will modify the interface band structure and metallicity which can bring radical changes into the electronic reconstruction mechanism .",
    "= 8.0 cm    in the investigation of a combined electron - lattice reconstruction in lao / sto , we first optimized the interface distance between tio@xmath2 and lao layers within lda @xcite .",
    "the optimal distance ( 1.89   ) is shorter then the bond length [ ti - o ] ( 1.953   ) in bulk sto which implies a contraction of the interfacial tio@xmath17 octahedra in agreement with the results of ref .  .",
    "after this optimization at the interface , the local positions of atoms in the sandwich were relaxed to the new energetically favourable values .",
    "in each plane , the structural relaxation leads to significant , diametrically opposed displacements of ti and o atoms in the [ 001 ] direction ( denoted below by @xmath18 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "a static polarization is built up , characterized by the elongation of tio@xmath17 octahedra by about 0.1    in [ 001 ] direction and by a buckling of the tio@xmath2 planes .",
    "the changes of the length @xmath19 of each ( a - o ) bond ( a  =  ti , sr , la ) are shown in fig .",
    "these displacements cause a formation of static dipole moments in an initially paraelectric sto layer ( similarly to what has been found in gga and gga+@xmath5 , ref .  ) and reflect the degree of buckling of lao , tio@xmath2 and sro planes .",
    "a good convergence of the dipole moments within the interfacial region of @xmath20    is achieved already for systems containing seven tio@xmath2-planes in the supercell .",
    "the dependence of the displacements on the distance from the interface agrees well with the results of ref .  , which suggest an exponential decay of the displacements .",
    "the largest bond distortions of 0.15    appear in the tio@xmath2 planes and increase for increasing thickness of the sto layers .",
    "in contrast to the sto layer , the distortions in the lao planes are negligibly small .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the most significant atomic displacements @xmath21     do not extend beyond a thickness of approximately 20   , which measures an effective depth of structural relaxations near the interface .",
    "= 8.0 cm    = 8.0 cm    in the electronic band structure calculated within lsda+@xmath5 , the deformation of tio@xmath17 produces a jahn - teller splitting of t@xmath22 states .",
    "it should be noted that the t@xmath22 states are partially filled by the charge carriers appearing due to the electronic reconstruction of the polar lao - sto interface .",
    "specifically , the structural distortions split the t@xmath22 levels into @xmath23 and degenerate @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands .",
    "as the atomic displacements strongly depend on the distance from the interface , the level splitting and related changes in the band structure will be different in the interface region and in the layers more distant from the interface .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the modifications of the projected density of states of ti in the layer next to the interface ( ti1 ) and in a more distant ( 3@xmath26 ) layer ( ti3 ) . in the interface layer",
    ", the relaxation leads to a slight shift of the conduction @xmath1 band and , more prominently , to a reduced dos close to the fermi energy which suggests a decrease of the charge carrier density .",
    "in contrast to the interface tio@xmath2 , the relaxed @xmath1 band of ti3 is displaced further below the fermi level and the dos at the fermi energy is enhanced .",
    "the shifts of the conduction bands also produce changes in their respective occupancies .",
    "they can be calculated through the integration of the dos in the range between the bottom of the conduction band and the fermi level .",
    "the calculated profiles of the electron charge density ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) suggest a charge depletion of the interfacial tio@xmath2-lao stack and consequent accumulation of the electron charge in the tio@xmath2 layers which are more distant from the interface .",
    "= 8.9 cm    the depletion of conducting charge in the interface layers not only results from the relaxation but may also be triggered through a growing number of tio@xmath2 planes in sto .",
    "this fact can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] which demonstrates a redistribution of a fixed amount ( 0.5 ) of compensated charge with an increasing number @xmath27 of tio@xmath2 layers from 2 to 5 . an important consequence of the electronic reconstruction at the interface is a decrease of electron density in the tio@xmath2 and lao interface planes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) which is stronger in systems with wider sto substructure . in our calculations ,",
    "an increase of the number of tio@xmath2 planes , @xmath27 , leads to a decrease of charge in the interfacial tio@xmath2 plane , with a tendency for a saturation of electron charge in the interface tio@xmath2 plane to a value of about 0.1  electrons for a growing number of tio@xmath2 planes in the sto slab . in the sto layer with 5 tio@xmath2 planes ,",
    "the residual @xmath28 electrons are distributed within the more distant tio@xmath2 planes , but about @xmath29 of the whole charge is located in the first three tio@xmath2 planes .",
    "it suggests a confinement of electron charge in an interface region of a thickness of 1020    in the sto layer .",
    "this finding agrees well with the experimental distribution of the ti excess charge discussed in ref .  , where the distinct peaks of the excess charge and its substantial decay with increasing distance from the interface demonstrate the confinement of charge to the interfacial region of a width of about @xmath30   .",
    "specifically , for sandwiches containing 9 to 11 tio@xmath2 layers , the ti excess charge approaches a value slightly above 0.1  electrons at a distance of about @xmath31@xmath32   , an experimental value  @xcite which is compatible with the values presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "we reason that the small width of the interfacial region is consistent with the conclusion that a quasi - two - dimensional electron gas is formed near the interface of a lao - sto heterostructure with a mm - thick sto substrate ( as discussed in ref .   and , more recently , in ref .  ) .",
    "experimentally , it has been established that lao - sto heterostructures with more than three unit cells of lao on sto substrates are metallic .",
    "for the analysis of the insulator - metal transition with increasing thickness of the lao film , one has to account for the features inherent to surfaces of transition metals and their oxides .",
    "the current studies of these surfaces are motivated by drastic changes of their physical and chemical properties with the realization of different types of atomic reconstruction in the surface and subsurface layers .",
    "furthermore , a number of _ ab - initio _ studies of this type of interfaces have identified a metallic @xmath4-type state with charge carriers which predominantly fill 3@xmath33 orbitals.@xcite    recent experiments give indications of a temperature dependence of the surface termination of lao which changes from alo@xmath2 to lao planes with an increase of temperature above 523  k.@xcite therefore , to understand the interface reconstruction mechanism in ultrathin lao films with an interference between surface and interface states , it is instructive to consider separately two possible types of the surface plane ( alo@xmath2 and lao ) in sto - lao bilayers .    for our theoretical studies , we have generated supercells which contain several lao unit cells deposited on 1.5 srtio@xmath0 unit cells .",
    "we have restricted calculations to structures with @xmath34 due to clear indications of charge confinement to a few unit cells of sto found in the analysis of sandwiches ( section [ chap : ii ] ) . to consider the surface properties , we have also introduced a 13    vacuum layer on top of laalo@xmath0 .",
    "the thickness of the laalo@xmath0 film has been varied from 1 to 3 unit cells . in a system with the topmost plane lao",
    ", an extra half of a lao unit cell has been attached to the top of the lao film .",
    "the lsda+@xmath5 calculations result in a stable nonmagnetic state of the system . in this state",
    ", the electronic properties strongly depend on the structural relaxation which is controlled by the thickness of the lao film in the slab .",
    "specifically , in the lsda+@xmath5 calculations , the initially chosen configurations with nonzero magnetic moments and charge inhomogeneities rapidly decayed to zero magnetic moments and to equal charge for all ti atoms in each tio@xmath2 plane which excludes the possibility for a decisive role of charge or magnetic order on the resultant electronic state .      to study the bilayers sto - lao with an alo@xmath2 plane at the top surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , we have generated a number of supercells with @xmath35 varying from 1 to 3 lao unit cells . in these supercells , the structural optimization results in a structure with large opposite distortions of cations and anions in the lao planes and only small atomic displacements in the sto substrate ( see fig .  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "such a relaxation pattern is completely distinct from the systems with lao termination which will be considered in the following section  [ lao_subs ] .",
    "the details of the structural changes are presented in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the first important feature is the strong buckling of the lao planes where the relative [ la - o ] displacement @xmath36 approaches a maximal value of @xmath37    in the structure with @xmath38 ( cf .",

    "the results are presented in table  [ tab2 ] . as appears in our calculations ,",
    "the optimized planar lattice constant , @xmath49 , strongly depends on the thickness of the lao film , varying from 3.805    for @xmath50 to 3.76    in a supercell with @xmath51 which clearly shows a tendency to approach the bulk lattice constant for laalo@xmath0 .",

    "[ tab2 ] , one finds that already in ultrathin lao films with @xmath54 and @xmath51 the planar lattice parameters @xmath49 are sufficiently close to the bulk values .",
    "in contrast to the sandwich - type structures characterized by small atomic displacements in the lao film , in the considered bilayer the atomic relaxation leads ( i ) to a substantial change of the distances @xmath55 between the topmost lao and nearest subsurface alo@xmath2 layers and ( ii ) to significant opposite displacements of the upper la and oxygen atoms of the top lao surface layers . specifically , we find that the distance [ lao - alo@xmath2 ] decreases by a value which ranges from 0.05    in a system with @xmath51 to 0.1  for a structure with @xmath50 ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) . furthermore , for larger @xmath35 the decrease of the la - o dipole moments in @xmath18 direction and of the contraction of the planar lattice constant results in a shortening of length of the planar [ la - o ] bond which varies from @xmath57",

    "an opposite trend is obtained when we increase the thickness of the lao film .",
    "specifically , the thicker lao layers exhibit smaller energy gaps and consequently higher charge carrier densities in the top lao layer .",
    "the structural relaxation plays a central role for the modifications of the electronic structure .",

    "the consequential increase of the electron charge on la ( fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ) is also related to the shift of the bottom of the la @xmath62 band towards lower energies in fig .",

    "we have studied the electronic structure of interfaces between the bulk insulators laalo@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 using the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) with intra - atomic coulomb repulsion ( lsda+@xmath5 ) .",
    "we find that the nature of the interface metallic states is strongly affected not only by the type ( sandwich or bilayer ) of the structure but also prominently by the termination surface of laalo@xmath0 . in all types",
    "the atomic relaxation plays a crucial role for the electronic properties of the system .    in sto - lao - sto sandwiches the structural relaxation results in an elongation of the tio@xmath17 octahedra by about 0.1    in the [ 001 ] direction and in a buckling of the tio@xmath2 planes of up to 0.15    for the plane nearest to the sto - lao interface .",
    "these displacements cause a significant polarization in srtio@xmath0 within about 10    from the interface .",
    "they also result in a jahn - teller splitting of the t@xmath22 states and the interface charge resides mostly in the ti @xmath1 bands .",
    "the conduction charge is confined essentially to the first three tio@xmath2 planes .    in bilayers",
    "the surface presents an additional important actor which may control the electronic state at the interface , especially when the surface is separated by an ultrathin film from the interface . for a lao film on top of a sto substrate , the termination ( either alo@xmath2 or lao ) at the surface is crucial for the atomic relaxation and the electronic state at the lao - sto interface .    in alo@xmath2-terminated bilayers",
    "the relaxation occurs primarily in the laalo@xmath0 film with minor displacements in srtio@xmath0 .",
    "specifically , the buckling of the subsurface lao plane and the modified distances between the topmost ( oppositely charged ) alo@xmath2 and lao planes introduces a polarization which decreases with the number @xmath35 of lao unit cells .",
    "for the unit cell thick lao films , it is this lattice relaxation with the corresponding polarization of the film which counteracts the polarization introduced through the self charging ( by 1/2 electron to compensate the interface polarity ) . for films with one unit cell lao",
    "we identify an insulating state characterized by an enegy gap of 1.5  ev between the ti @xmath1 states of the tio@xmath2 plane next to the interface and the oxygen states of the topmost alo@xmath2 plane . for films with more than one unit cell lao ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) this gap closes due to the enhanced polarization from the self charging .",

    "this scheme results in a transition from insulating to metallic states : in the present lda - calculations , due to the fact that lda underestimates the gap , the metallic state occurs already at @xmath50 whereas experiments show that bilayers with @xmath54 are still insulating whereas lao films with @xmath66 have been found to be metallic .",
    "finally , for lao - terminated bilayers the lattice relaxation is different : the surface tensile stress causes a charge occupation of la @xmath11 orbitals and a corresponding contraction of the top surface layers . here",
    ", one electron per interface unit cell is required to maintain the overall neutrality of the system . both , the ti @xmath1 states in the plane next to the interface and the la @xmath62have finite density of states at the fermi energy and stay metallic , irrespective of the number unit cells in the lao film .",

    "<S> the electronic structure of interfaces between laalo@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 is studied using local spin density approximation ( lsda ) with intra - atomic coulomb repulsion ( lsda+u ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the nature of the interface metallic states is strongly affected by the type of the structure ( sandwich or bilayer ) and by the termination surface of laalo@xmath0 . in all structures </S>",
    "<S> the atomic relaxation plays a crucial role in the electronic properties of the system . while in sandwiches </S>",
    "<S> the structural relaxation produces a significant polarization in srtio@xmath0 and jahn - teller like splitting of ti @xmath1 orbitals , in alo@xmath2-terminated bilayers the relaxation occurs primarily in laalo@xmath0 and results in an insulator - metal transition which has been observed experimentally with increasing thickness of the laalo@xmath0 layer . </S>"
