    "memory effects are ubiquitous in our daily life , ranging from the hysteresis loop in magnetization  @xcite to rechargeable batteries  @xcite . while the former is useful in information technology  @xcite , the latter limits the life of portable electronic devices .",
    "when a system exhibits memory effects , its states are history - dependent .",
    "shape - memory materials  @xcite and memory circuit elements  @xcite have been explored and shown potential applications . moreover , reproducible microstates in artificial spin - ice driven by a cyclic external magnetic field have been observed in both experiments and simulations  @xcite .",
    "most applications and understandings of memory effects are based on classical physics , and how memory effects can arise in simple microscopic quantum systems will be the main subject investigated here .",
    "band theory of electrons @xcite based on a noninteracting picture leads to great success in modern electronics industry .",
    "here we ask similar questions on whether noninteracting quantum systems can exhibit memory effects and what kinds of applications are out there . at first",
    "look it is counter - intuitive to consider memory effects in noninteracting systems because of a lack of competing time scales and information storage mechanism .",
    "this assertion is supported by previous work on transport in noninteracting quantum systems  @xcite which suggests that no signature of memory effects can be observed in the steady - state current as the system is driven with different time scales .",
    "a mathematical construction based on the idea of a bound state that can jump into and out of a continuum in a quantum - dot system suggests that memory effects may exist in noninteracting quantum systems  @xcite , although how such a system can be realized remains unclear . on the other hand ,",
    "the tunability of ultracold atom experiments has allowed explorations of quantum effects in both bosonic and fermonic systems in and out of equilibrium  @xcite . while electrons are always accompanied by coulomb interactions , interactions of cold - atoms are from two - body scattering , which can be turned off by applying an external magnetic field .",
    "thus , noninteracting quantum systems are readily available  @xcite and make cold - atom systems particularly suitable for unambiguous demonstrations of memory effects with or without self - interactions .",
    "indeed , atomic superfluids exhibit hysteresis loops similar to the magnetization  @xcite , so there is no doubt quantum memory effects can be demonstrated using cold atoms . the next milestone would be a demonstration of memory effects in noninteracting quantum systems .",
    "memory effects are closely tied to the dynamics and transport of the underlying systems because different evolution scenarios are needed for revealing the history of the system .",
    "several transport phenomena in mesoscopic systems have been demonstrated in cold - atom systems  @xcite , including quantum ratchet  @xcite , relaxation of fermions in optical lattices  @xcite , and sloshing motions  @xcite .",
    "beside analogous phenomena in solid - state systems , cold - atom experiments can further explore spin - imbalanced fermions  @xcite , inhomogeneous interactions  @xcite , and dynamical transformations of lattice geometry  @xcite . the optical kagome lattice realized in ref .",

    "interesting properties of flat - band systems with implications for cold atoms have been intensely studied  @xcite , and the presence of a flat band can interfere with quantum transport of other mobile particles  @xcite .    here , a mechanism of memory effects based on geometrical transformations of a quantum system is analyzed , where the presence of a flat band plays an important role .",
    "the main idea of this work is monitoring the dynamics of a quantum system continuously transformed from one geometry without any flat band into one with at least one flat band . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "[ ] , transforming a triangular lattice into a kagome lattice has been an available technology . as the time scale of the transformation changes , evidence of quantum memory effects showing different stationary particle distributions will be presented . to verify the contribution from the flat band , we consider another transformation from a triangular lattice to a square one , where none of the geometries support a flat band , and",
    "show that no memory effect can be observed .",
    "in contrast to the bound state mechanism in a quantum dot discussed in ref .  [ ] , the flat - band mechanism finds immediate applications in cold - atom systems and is readily verifiable .",
    "moreover , our results suggest that the flat - band induced memory effect should be observable in both fermionic and bosonic systems , which will allow for broader applications .    realizations of memory effects in simple quantum systems will make it possible to use time as an additional control parameter .",
    "the hysteresis of atomic superfluid currents  @xcite provides an example where the reversal of the current lags behind the stirring . when compared to typical electronic systems with high fermi velocity ( @xmath0 m/s ) and short tunneling time ( @xmath1 fs )  @xcite , the relatively slow motion of cold atoms with typical tunneling time scales of @xmath1 ms @xcite makes them particularly suitable for unveiling mechanisms responsible for quantum memory effects and exploring their applications . for instance , an accelerometer based on an atomic differentiator , a rate - controlled density valve , and a quantum memory - effect atomic memory ( qmeam ) will be proposed here .",
