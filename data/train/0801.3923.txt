    "all deviation vectors tend to fall on the @xmath14dimensional tangent space of the torus on which the motion lies .",
    "thus , if we start with @xmath15 general deviation vectors they will remain linearly independent on the @xmath14dimensional tangent space of the torus , since there is no particular reason for them to become aligned . as a consequence gali@xmath11 remains practically constant for @xmath15 . on the other hand",

    "zero values for regular orbits .",
    "this difference in the behavior of the index can be used to obtain a clear distinction between regular and chaotic orbits .",
    "let us illustrate this by following up to @xmath37 iterations , all orbits whose initial conditions lie on a 2dimensional grid of @xmath33 equally spaced points on the subspace @xmath34 , @xmath35 , of the 4dimensional phase space of the map ( [ 4dmap ] ) , attributing to each grid point a color according to the value of gali@xmath3 at the end of the evolution . if gali@xmath3 of an orbit becomes less than @xmath38 for @xmath39 the evolution of the orbit is stopped , its gali@xmath3 value is registered and the orbit is characterized as chaotic .",

    ", we see that after @xmath41 iterations the value of gali@xmath2 of a regular orbit should become of the order of @xmath42 , since gali@xmath43 , although the results of fig .  [ 4d_gali_beh ] show that more iterations are needed for this threshold to be reached , due to an initial transient time where gali@xmath2 does not decrease significantly . on the other hand , for a chaotic orbit gali@xmath2",
    "has already reached extremely small values at @xmath41 due to its exponential decay ( gali@xmath44 ) .",
    "thus , the global dynamics of the system can be revealed as follows : we follow the evolution of the same orbits as in the case of gali@xmath3 and register for each orbit the value of gali@xmath2 after @xmath41 iterations .",
    "all orbits having values of gali@xmath2 significantly smaller than @xmath42 are characterized as chaotic , while all others are considered as non  chaotic . in the right panel of fig .",

    "[ scan:1 ] , we see that both procedures , using gali@xmath3 or gali@xmath2 as a chaos indicator , give the same result for the global dynamics of the system , since in both cases 16% of the orbits are characterized as chaotic .",

    "[ scan:1 ] .",
    "one important difference between the two procedures is their computational efficiency .",
    "even though gali@xmath2 requires the computation of four deviation vectors , instead of only two that are needed for the evaluation of gali@xmath3 , using gali@xmath2 we were able to get a clear dynamical ` chart ' , not only for less iterations of the map ( 1000 instead of 4000 needed for gali@xmath3 ) , but also in less cpu time .",
    "in particular , for the computation of the data of the left panel of fig .",
    "[ scan:1 ] ( using gali@xmath3 ) we needed 1 hour of cpu time on an athlon 64bit , 3.2ghz pc , while for the data of the left panel of the same figure ( using gali@xmath2 ) only 14 minutes of cpu time were needed .    using the above  described method , both for gali@xmath3 and gali@xmath2 , we were able to compute very fast and accurately the percentages of regular motion for several values of parameter @xmath45 . in fig .",

    "we see that the two curves practically coincide , but using gali@xmath3 we needed almost four times more cpu time .",
    "so , it becomes evident that a well  tailored application of gali@xmath48 , with @xmath49 , can significantly diminish the cpu time required for the detailed ` charting ' of phase space regions , compared with that for gali@xmath3 .",
