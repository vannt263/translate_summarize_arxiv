    "one of the current experimental advances of considerable importance in the context of ultracold atoms is the demonstration of multicomponent bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . in particular several groups",
    "have created spinor condensates of @xmath0na atoms @xcite and @xmath1rb atoms @xcite by transferring spin polarized condensates into far - off - resonance optical dipole traps , where the spin degree of freedom becomes active and the spinor nature of the condensates is manifested .",
    "the spin - mixing dynamics and its dependence on the magnetic field have been investigated in detail for both spin-1 and spin-2 condensates in a number of theoretical @xcite and experimental works @xcite .",
    "since the spin degree of freedom becomes accessible in an optical trap , the magnetic dipole - dipole interactions ( mddi ) which arise from intrinsic or induced field of magnetic dipole moment @xcite should be taken into account in addition to the isotropic @xmath2-wave contact interaction .",
    "due to their long - range and vectorial characters , the mddi may largely enrich the variety of phenomena observed in condensates .",
    "therefore this opens up new directions of research , such as the ground - state structure of spin-1 dipolar condensates in a single trap @xcite as well as the ground - state magnetic properties of spinor bec confined in deep optical lattices @xcite , where only the dipolar interactions between condensates at different sites are considered .",
    "recently , a beautiful experiment in stuttgart @xcite has demonstrated bec in a gas of chromium atoms @xmath3 , the mddi of which is a factor of 36 higher than that for alkali atoms .",
    "this achievement makes possible the studies of the anisotropic long - range interactions in degenerate quantum gases .",
    "the present paper exploits semiclassical dynamics of spin-1 dipolar condensates in a single trap and shows the time evolutions of the population imbalance and the relative phase among different spin components @xcite .",
    "this study may help us gain some insights into the properties of this dipolar spinor condensate , such as quantum phase diffusion , spontaneous magnetization @xcite and macroscopic quantum self trapping ( mqst ) .",
    "especially , mqst known as a novel nonlinear effect has already been predicted theoretically @xcite and very recently observed experimentally in double - well trap @xcite and periodic optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the self trapping effect sustains a self - maintained  interwell population imbalance during the nonlinear * *  * * tunneling process . here",
    "we will show that for a dipolar condensate the interplay between spin - exchange and mddi gives rise to the intercomponent mqst naturally .",
    "moreover , due to the adjustability of the mddi , the experimental observation of the mqst effect in dipolar spinor condensates can be * *  * * expected**. * *    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
