    "the formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of density functionals instead of wave functions , following the ground - breaking works of hohenberg , kohn , and sham  @xcite , made numerical simulations of quantum mechanical systems ranging from the microscopic to the macroscopic world feasible  @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of density functional theory ( dft ) is certified by the number of works based on the original publications  @xcite and on later improvements of the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy density functional @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "dft in its most widely used form , namely kohn - sham ( ks ) dft  @xcite , requires the xc density functional in order to be able to compute ground state energies and densities . by virtue of the hohenberg - kohn theorem",
    "@xcite , all ground state observables are functionals of the ground state density @xmath1 , and so @xmath2 $ ] . the ground state energy @xmath3 $ ] of a system",
    "can be decomposed into a kinetic , an interaction and a potential part . by means of a fictitious non - interacting system , namely the ks system ,",
    "the non - interacting part of the kinetic energy , @xmath4 $ ] , can be obtained efficiently , which represents a large contribution to the full interacting kinetic energy @xmath5 .",
    "further , part of the interaction energy is accounted for by the hartree energy @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "the potential part @xmath7 $ ] can be exactly computed efficiently for any ground state density @xmath1 . finally , the remaining part of the total ground state energy defines the xc density functional , @xmath8:=e[n]-t^{\\mathrm{s}}[n]-e_{\\mathrm{h}}[n]-e_{\\mathrm{v}}[n]$ ] .",
    "dft is in principle exact , but in practice determining the precise form of the xc density functional is qma - hard  @xcite .",
    "therefore , ks dft can only make use of approximations of @xmath0 .",
    "the enormous success of dft is thus deeply connected to the successful construction of good approximations for the xc energy density functional .    in the history of dft and quest for a universally applicable approximate @xmath0  @xcite ,",
    "mainly two different paths have been followed : one is the non - empirical approach pioneered by perdew  @xcite and the other is the semi - empirical approach initiated by becke  @xcite .",
    "the non - empirical approach makes use of exact conditions , that a physical system must fulfill , to find approximations for the xc density functional . within this approach a `` jacob s ladder '' of functionals",
    "was built where each functional on a higher rung of the ladder is supposed to improve upon the ones on the lower rungs  @xcite . on the lowest rung of the `` jacob s ladder '' resides the local density approximation ( lda ) , which was already introduced by kohn and sham in  @xcite .",
    "the higher rungs are supposed to systematically improve upon the lda , which , in practice , does not always happen  @xcite .",
    "additionally , at the moment , the more precise functionals on the higher rungs are so much more difficult to compute that further improvements of dft following this non - empirical approach seem very hard to achieve . in the semi - empirical approach ,",
    "an ansatz for the functional form of @xmath0 is fitted using experimental data , accurate theoretical reference data , or other constraints .",
    "however , often relatively small training sets are used in these fits and then the resulting functionals can be biased towards their training  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we might obtain further improvements of @xmath0 away from but using concepts of both the semi - empirical and the non - empirical approach , e.g.  by using a large set of accurate training densities and corresponding values of @xmath0 , and by fitting an efficient ansatz to these data that includes some exact conditions .",
    "obviously , a difficulty of this alternative scheme is that it requires a possibly large number of accurate solutions for the quantum many - body problem .",
    "however , nowadays , tensor network states provide precise results for quantum many - body systems , e.g.  @xcite , in particular with respect to ground state properties .",
    "we remark that tensor network methods are currently limited to low - dimensional , i.e.  one- and some two - dimensional , quantum lattice problems while dft usually handles three - dimensional continuous quantum systems .",
    "since dft can be applied to a wide range of realistic quantum systems , it is a useful algorithm for a large community and thus worth improving .    in this article",
    ", we want to analyze the feasibility of constructing an approximate xc density functional of a specific form , when large training sets of ground state densities and corresponding values of @xmath0 are available .",
    "the specific form for the ansatz of our approximation is inspired by the non - empirical approach  @xcite : it includes the lda  @xcite and allows a systematic improvement beyond it . for this feasibility study ,",
    "we focus on discrete lattice problems and the one - dimensional case , and we use matrix product states ( mps ) for the computation of accurate ground state energies and densities  @xcite .",
    "the specific discrete lattice problem considered here can be derived from discretization of continuous space , i.e.  the usual scenario of dft .",
    "then our ansatz can be seen as the discretized version of a continuous function .",
    "although we could approach the continuum solution by successively decreasing the discretization , taking the continuum limit is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the structure of this article is as follows . in",
    "we introduce the considered hamiltonian and observables .",
    "the corresponding exact lda is presented in .",
    "we then propose , fit , and assess our ansatz in . finally ,",
    "in we conclude this work and give an outlook .",
    "in the following , we consider two species of fermions with long - ranged soft - coulomb interaction on a finite one - dimensional lattice of length @xmath9 with hard - wall boundary conditions , as represented by the hamiltonian : @xmath10 with @xmath11here , @xmath12 creates and @xmath13 annihilates a fermion of species @xmath14 on lattice site @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the corresponding occupation number operator and @xmath17 .",
    "the total particle number is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "we obtain ground states with different total particle number by choosing different values for the chemical potential @xmath19 , which plays the role of a lagrange multiplier fixing @xmath20 .",
    "such a hamiltonian can also describe the discretized continuous problem with lattice spacing @xmath21 when in   @xmath22 is replaced by @xmath23 and in   the denominator @xmath24 is replaced by @xmath25 .",
    "the solution for different discretizations can be very precisely computed with mps  @xcite and so our approach should yield highly accurate training densities .",
    "if we would like to obtain the solution for continuous space , we would have to run our computations repeatedly with decreasing lattice spacing @xmath21 and extrapolate our results to @xmath26 .",
    "here we see   as the hamiltonian of the problem , and not a discrete version of a more fundamental one , thus we set @xmath27 and @xmath28 and fix the number of lattice sites to @xmath29 from now on .    on a finite lattice , densities @xmath30 can be written into a vector @xmath31 - where @xmath32 denotes the transpose - such that every density functional @xmath33 can be written as a function of such density vectors @xmath34 . in the following",
    ", we will consider the _",
    "universal hohenberg - kohn functional _",
    "@xmath35 , the _ hartree - energy _",
    "@xmath36 , and the _ non - interacting kinetic energy _",
    "@xmath37 , e.g.  @xcite . for the above hamiltonian   these functionals read : @xmath38where",
    "@xmath39 denotes the ground state energy of an interacting density @xmath40 , i.e.  corresponding to   with @xmath41 , and @xmath42 denotes the ground state energy of a non - interacting density @xmath40 , i.e.  corresponding to   without @xmath41 . knowing the values of these functionals  ,  , and   for a particular density @xmath40 allows to calculate the _ xc energy _",
    "@xmath0 for that density : @xmath43    however , given an arbitrary density vector @xmath40 , only @xmath36 is trivial to compute : @xmath35 requires the knowledge of the external potential as a function of the density , @xmath44 , and @xmath37 requires the knowledge of the effective non - interacting kohn - sham potential @xmath45 .",
    "this process of calculating the external potential @xmath46 , in which the ground state has the given density @xmath40 , is called _ inversion _ and can be performed efficiently only in the non - interacting case or for two fermions  @xcite . in general , there exists no efficient inversion procedure for the interacting case and we use a slight modification of the iteration proposed in  @xcite : aiming at the target density @xmath47 , we iterate @xmath48 until @xmath49 - where @xmath50 denotes euclidean norm - is below a desired precision threshold . here",
    ", @xmath51 is the ground state density in the external potential @xmath52 at the iteration step @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is adjusted during the iterations to speed up the convergence . since interacting inversion",
    "necessitates several ground state computations to attain an approximate solution , it is not efficient .",
    "even more sophisticated iteration schemes can not circumvent that some densities require incredibly many iterations , i.e.  ground state computations , until convergence  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in general , interacting inversion represents a computationally demanding task .",
    "as the exact form of @xmath0 from   is not known , in practice , approximations are used .",
    "one of the simplest and most successful approximations is the lda  @xcite .",
    "the exact lda @xmath55 is defined via the homogeneous electron gas , i.e.  via exactly homogeneous densities @xmath56 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath57  @xcite : @xmath58 this quantity is then used to approximate the xc energy of a finite system by @xmath59 because @xmath60 is the exact xc energy for exactly homogeneous densities in the thermodynamic limit , it represents a good approximation for relatively homogeneous densities on large lattices @xmath61 .",

    ", scaledwidth=55.0% ]    our feasibility study here assumes a relatively small lattice of size @xmath29 with hard - wall boundary conditions , such that finite size and boundary effects play a role .",
    "we therefore derive our own lda for this system and do not make use of the existing results in  @xcite .",
    "shows our @xmath62 obtained from numerically exactly homogeneous densities computed by means of non - interacting ( for @xmath67 ) and interacting ( for @xmath68 ) inversions on @xmath29 lattice sites for all possible total particle numbers @xmath69 . to allow for an efficient evaluation of @xmath70 ,",
    "we parametrize the function @xmath62 using a finite number of parameters . a simple way to achieve this is to assume a polynomial form @xmath63 of certain degree @xmath71 and to fit our results using different values of @xmath71 . in the fit of each polynomial @xmath63",
    ", we impose the physically reasonable constraint @xmath72 , which trivially holds for the exact @xmath0 , as can be seen in  : obviously @xmath73 because every term in   vanishes independently for zero total particle number , and @xmath74 because @xmath75 and @xmath76 due to impossible tunneling .",
    "apparently , our exact lda @xmath77 is well approximated by polynomials of low degree @xmath71 since , on the scale of , the @xmath78 fit seems indistinguishable from the @xmath79 fit .",
    "the lda resides on the lowest rung of `` jacob s ladder ''  @xcite and the most successful approximations of @xmath0 beyond the lda were built on top of it  @xcite .",
    "analogously , we will use the lda computed above as our reference , and we will try to improve upon it with a more general ansatz for the functional .",
    "our approach for the construction of an improved xc energy approximation consists of two parts .",
    "firstly , it requires an efficient variational density functional ansatz , denoted by @xmath80 , to approximate @xmath0 .",
    "secondly , a set of @xmath81 external potentials has to be specified , which will be called _ training scenario _",
    ", such that the corresponding @xmath81 exact ground state densities @xmath82 , called _ training densities _ , and exact values @xmath83 are used to determine @xmath80 by minimizing a cost function @xmath84 over the variational parameters of @xmath80 .",
    "we are interested in an ansatz that , firstly , includes the lda and , secondly , allows for a systematic improvement over it by including non - local terms . in this spirit , we propose a two - site ansatz of the following form : @xmath85 with @xmath86for @xmath87 , we have @xmath88 , which is completely analogous to the lda  . and for @xmath89 , the @xmath90 terms allow for a more general dependence on the density with two - site functions over a range limited by @xmath91 . in this way , increasing @xmath91 allows us to systematically include more non - local information and to go beyond the local lda .    in order to have a practical functional , we want to write it in terms of a discrete set of variational parameters .",
    "thus we need to restrict the form of the functions @xmath92 . for simplicity",
    "we choose here a polynomial form for each term , as we did in the previous for the reference lda . additionally , in all following numerical experiments",
    ", we simply fix the degree of the polynomial to @xmath79 .    when @xmath93 is assumed to be a polynomial of the @xmath94 , the variational parameters of @xmath80 are the polynomial coefficients . then the desired @xmath95 , i.e.  the argument of @xmath96 that minimizes the cost function , results from the solution of linear equations @xmath97 where the polynomial coefficients of @xmath80 are vectorized in @xmath98 , the exact values are vectorized in @xmath99 , and the elements in the matrix @xmath100 establish the correct connection to the cost function  : @xmath101 .",
    "we want to emphasize that this approach does not need any computationally demanding interacting inversion . because the training densities @xmath82 follow from the training potentials , i.e.  from @xmath81 different choices of @xmath102 in  , we know @xmath103 . while the calculation of @xmath104 is trivial , @xmath105 is computed via efficient non - interacting inversion .",
    "thus , all further ingredients for @xmath83 of   are then efficiently computable .",
    "the first step in our approach is to consider the ansatz @xmath106 , with @xmath107 a polynomial in @xmath94 of degree @xmath71 with coefficients @xmath108 ( and @xmath79 in the following ) .",
    "the simplest possible , `` homogeneous '' , training scenario amounts to setting @xmath109 , in which case we have one training density for each possible total particle number @xmath110 , i.e.  at most @xmath111 for @xmath29 .",
    "demonstrates how training our local term @xmath112 with such ground states reproduces the exact lda .",
    "remarkably , a very good match between our @xmath112 and the exact lda is achieved already with @xmath113 ground state computations .",
    "this has to be compared to the several thousands of ground state computations that were required for due to the interacting inversion iteration .",
    "local terms @xmath114 from the `` homogeneous '' training scenario with @xmath115 ( dotted ) , @xmath116 ( dashed ) , and @xmath117 ( solid ) , compared to the exact lda ( crosses ) . here , @xmath112 is a polynomial of degree @xmath79 . ,",
    "scaledwidth=55.0% ]    we can understand that the `` homogeneous '' training scenario leads to the exact lda because this scenario contains relatively homogeneous training densities and because the exact lda is constructed from exactly homogeneous densities . now we want to consider more inhomogeneous densities . for that purpose",
    "we propose the simplest possible extension of the `` homogeneous '' training scenario : the `` step '' training scenario shown in ( a ) .",
    "this scenario contains the simplest external potentials that give rise to inhomogeneous ground state densities , see ( b ) for some example densities .",
    "the `` step '' training scenario allows us to generate much larger training sets since we define it by free choice of : a ) the step position ( from @xmath118 ) , b ) the step height ( from @xmath119 ) , c ) the step orientation ( _ left _ or _ right _ ) , and d ) the total particle number ( from @xmath120 ) .",
    "we do not include total particle numbers @xmath20 larger than @xmath117 in this training set because we want it to contain sufficiently inhomogeneous densities that become more inhomogeneous when the step height increases ; clearly , for large total particle numbers such as more than @xmath117 fermions on @xmath121 lattice sites , an increasing step height quickly creates large homogeneous regions of maximum filling in the density , i.e.  having @xmath122 fermions per lattice site .",

    "we can then look at the quantity @xmath136 where @xmath137 denotes the @xmath53th parameter of @xmath80 after training with @xmath81 densities and @xmath138 denotes taking the mean value over all @xmath139 possible values of @xmath53",

    "interestingly , this training scenario gives rise to local terms @xmath112 that are very similar to the exact lda , although many training densities of this scenario are very inhomogeneous .",

    "all in all , although such improved ansaetze and training scenarios must definitely achieve better results than the ones reported here , a careful analysis is beyond the scope of this proof - of - principle work .",
    "it would be very interesting to combine our procedure with concepts from recent works on machine learning of density functionals  @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , these works typically required less training densities than our approach . on the other hand , our work constructs systematic corrections to a standard approximation , namely the lda , that can be applied in general , i.e.  to other types of systems beyond those that were originally used for the fit .",
    "thus , a combination of the good aspects of our procedure with the good aspects of the previous machine learning concepts could be the ultimate solution to some of the problems that both approaches currently have independently from each other .    in this article",
    ", we focused exclusively on approximations of the density functional for the xc energy .",
    "however , in principle , any ground state observable can be written as a functional of the ground state density  @xcite .",
    "our proposed scheme allows in principle to also construct systematically density functionals for observables other than the ground state energy",
    ". this fact might now be useful for ultracold atoms in optical lattices since the densities of these systems have become experimentally accessible with remarkable resolution  @xcite .",
    "measurements of a certain observable which are difficult to perform with the current techniques might be easier to carry out now when a density functional would be provided for that observable .",
    "particularly interesting measurements regard two - dimensional systems with special observables , such as e.g.  special order parameters .",
    "the corresponding density functionals could be constructed with the help of projected entangled pair states ( peps )  @xcite . because experiments are restricted to finite system sizes ,",
    "peps algorithms are perfectly suited for the ground state simulation of such finite two - dimensional systems , for which they can produce accurate numerical results  @xcite .",
