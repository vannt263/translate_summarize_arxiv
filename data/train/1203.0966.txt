    ", the enhanced radial transport of particles and heat reduces the radial pressure gradient .",
    "this results in a reduction of the core plasma pressure , which degrades the plasma confinement . according to the theory of single - fluid resistive mhd",
    ", the evolution of a magnetic island is characterized by the rate of change in its width , which is proportional to the parameter @xmath0 @xcite : a measure of the free energy stored in the plasma current density for the magnetic reconnection to occur . for @xmath1 ,",
    "the island is predicted to grow .",
    "the neoclassical theory of tearing modes incorporates the effects of toroidal geometry in the layer surrounding the rational surface .",
    "one contribution to the current that influences the island evolution is the bootstrap current , which is proportional to the radial pressure gradient . because of the pressure gradient flattening , the bootstrap current is suppressed inside the island region .",
    "this perturbation in the bootstrap current enhances the original filamentation of the plasma current and hence drives the island growth @xcite .",
    "the neoclassical tearing modes ( ntms ) are characterized by this enhanced drive for the island growth , whose strength diminishes with increasing island width , @xmath2 .",
    "the result is that @xmath2 typically saturates at a substantial fraction of the tokamak minor radius , @xmath3 . in toroidal geometry",
    ", the curvature of the magnetic field lines provides a stabilizing contribution to the island evolution equation @xcite .",
    "this curvature effect is also found to be proportional to the pressure gradient and diminishes with the island width .",
    "thus it can be thought of as an effect that reduces the bootstrap drive ( except for sufficiently small islands @xcite ) , though the effect is typically small for the large aspect ratio tokamaks we consider in this paper .",
    "there is substantial experimental evidence for the existence of a threshold mechanism @xcite , whereby a sufficiently small island ( typically of @xmath4 ) does not grow to a large saturated island , but rather shrinks away .",
    "however , there is no concrete theoretical framework to explain the observed level of the threshold width for the island width and provide quantitative predictions .",
    "one possible mechanism is the effect of finite cross - field transport of particles and heat in the vicinity of the island separatrix @xcite .",
    "a consequence of the finite radial transport is that the pressure gradient is not completely flattened across the island width , and then the bootstrap drive for the island width is reduced .",
    "another possible source of the threshold mechanism is the polarization current , which is induced when the island is in relative motion with the bulk of the plasma .",
    "a number of works have considered the finite ion larmor radius ( flr ) effect on tearing mode evolution in sheared slab geometry @xcite , which can give rise to the polarization current when the island width is comparable to the ion larmor radius , @xmath5 .",
    "however , whether this flr effect can stabilize the island depends on the plasma conditions and , in particular , the island propagation frequency . in toroidal geometry , the effect of finite trapped ion orbit width , or the ion , @xmath6 , can also generate a polarization current . because @xmath7 , this neoclassical contribution dominates the polarization current except perhaps in the vicinity of the island separatrix , where the flr effect is also likely to be important . the origin of the neoclassical polarization current can be understood as follows . as the magnetic island propagates through the plasma ,",
    "ions and electrons respond differently ; the ion response is dominated by the @xmath8 drift , whereas the parallel transport dominates the electron response . however , because of the difference in ion and electron banana widths ( @xmath9 ) , the orbit - averaged @xmath8 drifts of trapped ions and electrons differ , resulting in a net current perpendicular to the magnetic field lines ( see fig .",

    "this is the neoclassical polarization current , which in turn generates a parallel current perturbation to ensure that @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the current density .",
    "it is this parallel current perturbation that contributes to the island evolution .",
    "past analytical works @xcite show that this neoclassical polarization current contribution depends strongly on the plasma collision frequency regime ; it is @xmath12 smaller in the collisionless limit ( @xmath13 ) , compared to the collisional limit ( @xmath14 ) . here",
    ", @xmath15 is the ion - ion collision frequency , @xmath16 is the inverse aspect ratio ( @xmath3 and @xmath17 are the minor and major radii respectively ) and @xmath18 is the island propagation frequency in the @xmath8 rest frame . in this paper",
    ", we aim to develop the nonlinear drift kinetic theory of refs . and further to determine the full collision frequency dependence of the neoclassical polarization current .     a cross section of a magnetic island indicating the directions of the electric field perturbation ( @xmath19 ) , equilibrium magnetic field ( @xmath20 ) , island propagation ( @xmath18 ) and the polarization current ( @xmath21 ) . ]",
    "as discussed above , the neoclassical polarization current is seeded by the trapped particles ( through the finite ion banana width effect ) .",
    "collisions transfer the current perturbation carried by the trapped particles to the passing particles at the rate @xmath22 . in the high collision frequency",
    "limit @xmath23 ( but collisionality , @xmath24 ) , the collisional momentum transfer takes place sufficiently quickly that the time variation of the trapped particle response is resolved , and the polarization current is communicated to the passing particles and amplified in the process . on the other hand , in the low collision frequency limit ( @xmath25 ) the collisional transfer does not resolve the time variation and the polarization current remains at the seed level , which is @xmath12 smaller than that in the collisional limit .",
    "taking into account the contributions discussed so far , the island evolution equation can be written in the form of the : @xmath26    here , @xmath27 is the resistive time scale , @xmath28 denotes the bootstrap drive for the island growth and @xmath29 denotes the contribution from the curvature effect . as discussed in detail below , we separate the contribution from the neoclassical polarization current into two parts : @xmath30 denotes the contribution from the neoclassical polarization current away from the island separatrix ( which we shall call the ) and @xmath31 denotes the contribution from the narrow layer that surrounds the island separatrix ( the ) .",
    "our interest in this paper is focused on the term @xmath30 .",
    "we characterize the strength of the neoclassical polarization current by introducing the dimensionless parameter @xmath32 and write @xmath33    where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the plasma poloidal @xmath37 .",

    "@xmath46 is a weak logarithmic function of @xmath47 and the dependence on @xmath48 appears from the finite collisional effects in the narrow layer around the trapped / passing boundary in pitch angle space @xcite .",
    "other works have considered the effect of collision frequency on the polarization current , including : ref . , which employs the linear mhd theory ; and refs . and , in which the collision frequency dependence is calculated by numerical simulation . in refs . and",
    ", however , only the ion response is determined and quasineutrality is not imposed to derive the self - consistent electrostatic potential , @xmath49 . as has been pointed out in refs . and",
    ", the polarization current is proportional to the second radial derivative of @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "hence it is likely to be important to work with a self - consistent form of @xmath49 , which introduces an additional complication .",
    "there is a large contribution ( formally a @xmath51-function ) to @xmath50 from the vicinity of the island separatrix , where simplified models predict a discontinuity in the electric field ; this generates a skin current contribution to the ion polarization current .",
    "this provides an additional contribution to the island evolution equation denoted by @xmath31 in eq . ( [ mre ] ) , which is expected to be comparable in magnitude and of opposite sign to the contribution from outside the separatrix layer @xcite , @xmath30 .",
    "however , the contribution from this separatrix layer requires an extended physics model to treat it , including the flr effect @xcite , non - linearities in the parallel electric field and non - perturbative cross - field diffusion @xcite .",
    "consequently its contribution to the island evolution scales differently with plasma parameters to that outside the layer .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to separate the calculation into two regions , considering the contribution to the neoclassical ion polarization current from each region separately . in this paper , we address only the contribution from outside the separatrix layer , which we called the polarization current [ see eq .",
    "( [ mre ] ) ] .",
    "this enables us to focus on the physics of the transition between the collision frequency regimes without the complicated physics of the separatrix layer .",
    "we leave the more complicated layer polarization current calculation for future research .    to summarize , the objective of this paper is to extend the drift kinetic theory developed in refs . and to determine the full collision frequency dependence of the neoclassical ion polarization current ( i.e. that away from the separatrix layer ) and calculate its contribution to the island evolution . in particular , we consider the dependence of @xmath32 on the collision frequency in the previously unexplored intermediate regime , where @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , we consider the influence of the island propagation frequency @xmath18 on the contribution of the neoclassical polarization current to the island evolution .",

    "<S> the neoclassical polarization current , generated when a magnetic island propagates through a tokamak plasma , is believed to influence the initial stage of the neoclassical tearing mode evolution . understanding the strength of its contribution in the relevant plasma collision frequency regimes for future tokamaks such as iter is crucial for the successful control and/or avoidance of the neoclassical tearing mode . </S>",
    "<S> a nonlinear drift kinetic theory is employed to determine the full collision frequency dependence of the neoclassical polarization current in the small island limit , comparable to the trapped ion orbit width . focusing on the region away from the island separatrix ( where a layer with a complex mix of physics processes exists ) , we evaluate for the first time the variation of the neoclassical ion polarization current in the transition regime between the analytically tractable collisionless and collisional limits . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the island propagation frequency - dependence of the neoclassical polarization current and its contribution to the island evolution is revealed . for a range of propagation frequencies , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the neoclassical polarization current is a maximum in the intermediate collision frequency regime analyzed here - a new and unexpected result . </S>"
