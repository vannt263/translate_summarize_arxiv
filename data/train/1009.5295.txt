    "one can show from a simple argument based on causality  @xcite that if long range rapidity correlations between particles exist , the correlation must be formed at proper times earlier than @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the freeze - out time of the particles .",
    "this causality argument is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] .",
    "if we assume this freeze - out time to be of the order of a few fermis , a rapidity correlation of @xmath21 units suggests that these correlations must be formed nearly instantaneously after the collision or must preexist in the incoming projectiles .",
    "they are therefore very sensitive to the strong color fields present in the initial stage and their correlations .     and",
    "@xmath22 here ) must occur at very early proper times .",
    "the doubly shaded region , corresponding to the intersection of the light cones of the two particles , is the space - time location where correlations can be formed.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in a recent paper  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , it was shown in detail how these long range correlations arise as a consequence of the saturation of gluons with momenta @xmath23 in the nuclear wave functions _ before _ the collision . here",
    "@xmath24 is a semi - hard saturation scale  @xcite , which provides a measure of the range of color correlations in a _ nucleon or nucleus_. this scale is large for _ either high energies or large nuclei or both _ , suggesting the presence of strong universal dynamical color correlations at distances smaller than the scale of confinement dynamics @xmath25 in qcd . because @xmath26 is large , a quantitative understanding of the highly non - perturbative dynamics of saturated gluons in feasible in weak coupling , and is realized in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) effective theory  @xcite of hadron and nuclear wavefunctions at high energies .",
    "the reference  @xcite provides a quantitative comparison with the phobos data and makes predictions for similar correlations in a+a collisions at the lhc .",
    "when two hadrons or nuclei collide at high energies , the cgc framework predicts that strong longitudinal chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields are produced that are nearly boost - invariant  @xcite ; this form of matter has been called the glasma  @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize here at the outset that the properties of the glasma are not computed in an _ ad hoc _ model but follow from high energy factorization theorems which relate multi - particle dynamics in the glasma to multi - parton correlations in saturated hadron / nuclear wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "a key feature of the glasma is that the transverse correlation length of these strong longitudinal chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields is @xmath27 .",
    "two - particle  @xcite and three - particle  @xcite correlations were computed in this glasma `` flux tube '' picture .",
    "we should note that the @xmath28-particle correlations can be shown to satisfy a negative binomial distribution  @xcite  providing a microscopic derivation of this widely used multiplicity distribution .",
    "these correlations are independent of @xmath29 up to quantum corrections that become important for @xmath30 . in heavy ion collisions",
    "the collimation in @xmath31 comes primarily from the subsequent radial flow of the correlated particles  @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed in more detail below , an intrinsic @xmath31 collimation is also present independently of the effects from flow in the later stages of the collision .",
    "it is very weak for the small @xmath26 values that are attained in p+p , d+a and peripheral a+a collisions at rhic . at lhc energies , for the large multiplicity cuts performed by the cms experiment ( which select central impact parameters ) ,",
    "the signal is stronger because @xmath26 is larger but not as strong as in central @xmath32 collisions , because the effect of radial flow is smaller or absent . indeed",
    ", `` predictions '' previous to the cms announcement existed  @xcite but were not submitted for publication because it appeared inconceivable that such a small signal would be detected experimentally  this places the _ tour de force _ measurement by cms in perspective !    we shall now show some of our results that exhibit the same qualitative features as the cms results .",
    "more quantitative comparisons would require a more detailed understanding of the impact parameter dependence affecting the normalization , experimental efficiency and acceptance effects and the contribution of radial flow .",

    "the single inclusive gluon spectrum can be expressed in the same notation as  @xcite @xmath40 the above expressions ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : double - inclusive ] and [ eq : single - inclusive ] ) are valid to leading logarithmic accuracy in @xmath33 and for momenta @xmath41 .    the important ingredient in the above expressions is the unintegrated gluon density which is a universal quantity and can be constrained from fits to dis on hadron  @xcite and nuclear targets  @xcite  these unintegrated gluon densities have been used to compute single inclusive and double inclusive distributions in d+au collisions at rhic  @xcite . the only difference between different targets",
    "are in the initial conditions determined at an initial @xmath42chosen to be @xmath43 .",
    "the evolution of the ugd with rapidity is controlled by the balitsky ",
    "kovchegov ( bk ) equation  @xcite , which is a non  linear evolution equation describing both gluon emission and multiple scattering effects .",
    "we note that our unintegrated gluon distributions have recently been shown to be equivalent to those derived in the framework of transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) parton distributions  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ugd ] we show the structure of this unintegrated gluon distribution and its evolution with rapidity for a running coupling .",
    "the running of the coupling slows the evolution significantly which is essential to describe dis and hadron scattering data .",
    "in proton  proton collisions , unlike nucleus - nucleus collisions , it is not clear that there can be a sufficient amount of transverse flow to provide the collimation around @xmath44 necessary to explain the ridge .",
    "blast wave fits to proton single particle spectra at low @xmath12 are suggestive of non  vanishing radial flow , and this in principle could provide an additional collimation of the signal .",
    "we also note that in the highest multiplicity proton  proton events the charged particle multiplicity per unit rapidity is comparable to that found in semi ",
    "central cu  cu collisions .",
    "the possibility that additional collimation of the signal due to flow might be needed to reproduce the full strength of the measured correlation can not be completely ruled out .",
    "however , the absence of a correlation signal for small transverse momenta in proton - proton collisions ( contrary to the nucleus - nucleus case ) suggests that hydrodynamical flow would not be the dominant contribution here .",
    "a typical diagram which gives an angular collimation.,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    the main point of this paper is that there is an intrinsic angular correlation ( in addition to the long range rapidity correlation ) coming from the particle production process on transverse distance scales @xmath27 much smaller than the proton size .",
    "one of the diagrams that gives a collimation for @xmath45 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] .",
    "there is only a single loop momentum @xmath46 in these two - particle production diagrams , as opposed to uncorrelated production .",
    "the transverse momenta flowing into the `` blobs '' for hadron  a in this diagram are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . if we combine this with the fact that the unintegrated distributions peak about @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ugd ] ) it follows that the _ largest _ contribution is obtained when both @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "these conditions are satisfied simultaneously , for one and the same @xmath46 , if @xmath51 and @xmath52 are parallel , leading to angular collimation .",
    "the scale of the angular dependence is @xmath53 . also , if parametrically @xmath12 and @xmath54 are much smaller or much greater than @xmath26 , the collimation disappears .",
    "in contrast , in collinear factorization , at leading order both gluons are produced from the same ladder leading to collimation about @xmath55 ( `` dijet '' ) .",
    "one may therefore expect that diagrams such as fig .",

    "[ fig : five ] agrees with the cms observation of the ridge correlation becoming visible for higher multiplicity events .",

    "the normalization without additional free parameters would require going beyond the @xmath69-factorized expression ( [ eq : single - inclusive ] ) for the single inclusive spectrum  @xcite .",
    "however , in the appropriately normalized correlation ( [ eq : defc2 ] ) these factors cancel and our result does not depend strongly on the size of the overlap area .",

    "[ fig : six ] ( top ) we plot the @xmath12 dependence of @xmath59 .",

    ", we see that the distributions are symmetric around @xmath77 .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath78 , because qcd evolution ( gluon radiation ) between the projectiles to the produced gluons is asymmetric .",
    "the systematics could in principle be investigated to test our predictions in detail .",
    "the physics of gluon saturation opens up a novel domain of many body qcd at high energies and may contain many surprises which provide deeper insight into the fundamental properties of strong interactions .",
    "one of these is the ridge in proton - proton collisions and it is likely that many more will be revealed at the lhc .",
    "the properties of saturated gluons , in particular the evolution of multi - parton correlations with energy , can be computed in the color glass condensate effective field theory .",
    "high energy factorization theorems allow us to relate these multi - parton correlations in the hadron and nuclear wavefunctions to inclusive multi - parton final states in collisions .",

    "( [ eq : double - inclusive ] ) is one of the results of this approach .",
    "it provided a detailed understanding of the ridge in a+a collisions at rhic .",
    "it predicts a ridge in p+p collisions .",
    "we computed in this paper the two - particle correlation @xmath59 ( eq .  ( [ eq : defc2 ] ) ) and showed that it shares the same key features as the quantity @xmath9 measured by the cms experiment :    * it is long range in rapidity , and exhibits a collimation for high multiplicity events for a narrow window of a few gev in the transverse momenta of the pair particles .",
    "the effect becomes systematically weaker both below and above the kinematic window as seen in the cms result .",
    "* the two - particle correlation has the same strength for both like and unlike sign pairs .",
    "this feature was seen already at rhic and is consistent with gluon emission from a source that is ( nearly ) uniform in rapidity , `` the glasma flux tube '' .",

    "we predict a similarly flat signal strength in three - particle correlations  @xcite .",
    "correlations of trigger particles at non central rapidities with associated particles at other rapidities can provide sensitive tests of this picture . in order to make a quantitive comparison one needs to add the short range jet component ( which can be generated with one of the available event ",
