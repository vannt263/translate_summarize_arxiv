    "the infrared space observatory ( iso ) has provided us with a wealth of new data in the infrared from regions of massive star formation .",
    "this includes unique information on molecules such as h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 , which are difficult to observe from the ground due to the earth s atmosphere . h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 are among the most abundant species in the envelopes of massive protostars and play a key role in the chemistry in these regions .",
    "h@xmath0o is a particularly powerful molecule to study the interaction of the protostar with its environment . in warm regions and shocks",
    "all gas - phase oxygen not locked up in co is thought to be driven into h@xmath0o , predicting greatly enhanced gas - phase h@xmath0o abundances .",
    "also , its level populations are influenced by mid- and far - infrared radiation from warm dust , in addition to collisions .",
    "observations of the well - studied star - forming region orion - kl indeed show strong gas - phase h@xmath0o lines , corresponding to abundances up to 10@xmath8 ( van dishoeck et al .",
    "1998 , gonzalez - alfonso et al .",
    "1998 , harwit et al .",
    "1998 , wright et al .",
    "high resolution fabry - prot observations of pure rotational h@xmath0o lines suggest that this gas is associated with warm and shocked regions ( wright et al .",
    "2000 ) . the co@xmath0 molecule on the other hand can not be observed through rotational transitions , because it does not have a permanent dipole moment .",
    "the excitation temperature of these types of molecules can be a useful indicator of the kinetic temperature of the region .",
    "we have studied gas - phase h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 toward a sample of 14 massive young stellar objects including gl  2136 , gl  2591 , w  3 irs5 , ngc  7538 irs9 , monr2 irs3 and gl  490 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the luminosities of these objects are @xmath610@xmath910@xmath10 l@xmath11 , the masses of the envelopes are @xmath6100 m@xmath11 and their distances are @xmath61 - 4 kpc .",
    "most of these objects show a multitude of gas - phase h@xmath0o absorption lines around 6 @xmath12 m in the sws spectra , originating in the @xmath13 ro - vibrational band .",
    "the ro - vibrational band at 15 @xmath12 m of gas - phase co@xmath0 has also been detected in many sources .",
    "the lws spectra , however , do not show strong lines of gas - phase h@xmath0o ( wright et al . 1997 ) .",
    "a subset of these sources has been studied previously by van dishoeck & helmich ( 1996 ) and van dishoeck ( 1998 ) .",
    "both molecules have also been detected in the solid phase toward many massive protostars ( e.g. gerakines et al .",
    "1999 , keane et al .",
    "this allows us to determine gas / solid ratios .",
    "in addition , most of these sources show a rich submillimeter emission spectrum , allowing the derivation of temperature and density profiles ( van der tak et al .",
    "the @xmath13 ro - vibrational bands of gas - phase h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 around 6 @xmath12 m and 15 @xmath12 m , respectively , have been observed with the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) in the aot6 grating mode .",
    "all spectra have been reduced using the standard pipeline reduction routines starting from spd level .",
    "in addition , the instrumental fringes have been removed by fitting a cosine to the data ( lahuis & van dishoeck  2000 ) .",
    "the 6 @xmath12 m spectra have been rebinned to a spectral resolution of @xmath14@xmath15=0.0020 @xmath12 m and the 15 @xmath12 m spectra to @xmath14@xmath15=0.0035 @xmath12 m .",
    "the @xmath16 ratio on the continuum is typically 50 - 100 in the final spectra .",
    "@xmath17 @xmath1(co ) from mitchell et al .",

    "the modeling of the spectra has been performed using synthetic spectra from helmich ( 1996 ) , assuming a homogeneous source with a single temperature @xmath26 and column density @xmath27 . since the h@xmath0o models are sensitive to different doppler @xmath24-values , a range of values between 1.5 and 10 km s@xmath25 has been used . for co@xmath0",
    "the models are not sensitive to the linewidth , so a mean value of @xmath24=3 km s@xmath25 is adopted here .",
    "this is in agreement with observations of other ro - vibrational absorption lines in the same wavelength region toward these sources .",
    "the best fit to the data has then been determined using the reduced @xmath28-method .",
    "some good fitting models are shown in fig . 1 and 2 for h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 respectively .",
    "an example of @xmath28 contours is shown in fig . 3 for the source gl  2136 .",
    "this figure illustrates that for low @xmath24-values ( i.e. @xmath292.5 km s@xmath25 ) the temperature and column density of the gas - phase h@xmath0o is not well constrained . in the following analysis @xmath24=5 km s@xmath25",
    "is adopted for h@xmath0o .",
    "this corresponds to the mean value of the @xmath19co @xmath30=1 - 0 absorption line widths found by mitchell et al .",
    "the results of the homogeneous model analysis for h@xmath0o are presented in fig . 4 and table 1 .",
    "it is seen that sources with higher excitation temperatures have higher column densities , although the increase is not very strong .",
    "the column densities have been converted into abundances with respect to the hot h@xmath0 gas , since the spectra show primarily the warmer h@xmath0o gas .",
    "the h@xmath0 column densities have been derived from infrared observations of @xmath19co assuming a @xmath31co/@xmath19co ratio of 60 and a @xmath31co / h@xmath0 ratio of 2@xmath3210@xmath8 ( e.g. mitchell et al .",
    "1990 , lacy et al .",
    "the resulting abundances increase with temperature , up to a few times 10@xmath2 for the hottest sources ( @xmath3 500 k ) ( fig.4 ) .",
    "the presence of strong c@xmath0h@xmath0 absorption toward the same sources ( lahuis & van dishoeck  2000 ) and the absence of this molecule in the well - known shocked regions peak 1 and peak 2 in orion ( boonman et al .",
    "2001 ) suggest that shocks do not play a dominant role .",
    "hot core models by charnley ( 1997 ) indicate h@xmath0o abundances of @xmath33 for @xmath34=300 k , consistent with our values .",
    "however , he assumes that the initial solid - state abundance of h@xmath0o is @xmath610@xmath2 , a factor of 10 lower than observed toward cold sources in which evaporation is not significant ( keane et al .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that part of the evaporated h@xmath0o is probably destroyed through rapid gas - phase reactions leading to atomic oxygen .",
    "although the homogeneous models provide a good fit to the data , they probably do not reflect the true excitation mechanism of the h@xmath0o molecule .",
    "since the level populations of h@xmath0o are influenced by radiation from warm dust , pumping has to be included in the models .",
    "also submillimeter observations show that both a temperature and density gradient is present in these objects ( van der tak et al . 2000 ) , and therefore an abundance gradient .",
    "therefore we have set up a power law model for one of our sources gl  2591 , using the models by doty & neufeld ( 1997 ) . in this model",
    "a density gradient @xmath35 r@xmath36 ( van der tak et al . 1999 ) is used .",
    "the temperature and abundance profiles are shown in fig .",
    "5 . only gas - phase chemistry is included at this point .",
    "although doty & neufeld report no significant changes in their models if gas - grain chemistry is included , further investigations have to confirm this .",
    "similar models will be set up for all other sources in our sample . the resulting model spectrum for gl  2591 ( fig .",
    "1 ) gives a good fit to the data .",
    "because of the high h@xmath0o abundance derived from the ro - vibrational lines , some pure rotational h@xmath0o lines are expected in the lws spectra . however , reduction of these spectra for gl  2591 only shows a hint of one line in absorption ( wright et al .",
    ". a first quick look at the lws spectra of the other sources shows only a few pure rotational lines of h@xmath0o .",
    "since the lws beam is so large ( @xmath680@xmath37 diameter ) compared to the angular size of the infrared sources , this suggests that the hot water fills only a small fraction of the lws beam ( @xmath38 few arcseconds ) close to the protostar , consistent with fig .",
    "the homogeneous model analysis for gas - phase co@xmath0 shows that this molecule is not very abundant in our sources .",
    "the column densities show only a weak increase with temperature , whereas the abundances are roughly constant for @xmath4 100 k at a value of a few @xmath3210@xmath5 .",
    "since both warm and cold co@xmath0 is detected , the abundances are given with respect to the total h@xmath0 column density ( fig .",
    "4 ) . these abundances are much lower than the solid - state abundances of @xmath613@xmath7 ( gerakines et al .",
    "this suggests that co@xmath0 is also being rapidly destroyed in the gas - phase after evaporation from the grains .",
    "shock chemistry has been suggested by charnley & kaufman ( 2000 ) , but more detailed models including evaporation have to be developed to determine the nature of these reactions .      from the column densities derived from the homogeneous models for h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 ,",
    "gas / solid ratios can been determined , using the solid - state features of h@xmath0o ( keane et al .",
    "2001 ) and co@xmath0 ( gerakines et al .  1999 ) as observed with iso - sws toward the same objects . for both species this",
    "ratio increases with temperature , consistent with the location of both species in the warm inner part of the envelope .",
    "however the increase is much stronger for h@xmath0o than for co@xmath0 , although co@xmath0 is more volatile than h@xmath0o .",
    "the higher ratios for the warmer sources indicate that they are in a later evolutionary stage than the sources with low gas / solid ratios ( van der tak et al .",
    "2000 , van dishoeck & van der tak 2000 ) .",
    "gas - phase h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 are detected towards a large number of massive protostars with iso - sws .",
    "modeling of the spectra shows that h@xmath0o is hot and abundant .",
    "the abundances of gas - phase co@xmath0 are however not very high .",
    "chemical models will be developed in the near future to attempt to explain the differences between these molecules and to investigate the possible destruction of these species through gas - phase reactions .",
    "a power law physical - chemical model for one source shows good agreement with the data .",
    "the lws data for the same sources show mostly a lack of pure rotational h@xmath0o lines , indicating that the warm gas probed by the ro - vibrational lines is located close to the protostar .",
