    "the evidence that our universe is experiencing a phase of expansion with accelerated rate has been well demonstrated by cosmological data obtained from different independent observations of sneia , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) anistropies , x - ray experiments and large scale structures ( lss ) @xcite .",
    "three main ideas have been suggested to give a reasonable explanation to the present day observed accelerated expansion of our universe : the cosmological constant @xmath3 model , dark energy ( de ) models and theories of modified gravity models .",
    "thorough discussions on these three ideas are available in the reviews of @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath3 , which has eos parameter @xmath4 , represents the earliest and the simplest theoretical candidate suggested in order to give a plausible explaination to the observational evidences of the universe s present day accelerated expansion .",
    "it is well - known , anyway , that there are two main problems associated with @xmath3 : the fine - tuning and the cosmic coincidence problems .",
    "the former mainly asks why the vacuum energy density is so small ( about an order of @xmath5 lower than what we can observe ) while the latter asks why the vacuum energy and dm give a nearly equal contribution at the present epoch even if they had an evolution which is independent and they had also evolved from mass scales which are different ( this fact represents a really strange coincidence if some internal connections between them are not taken into account ) .",
    "till now , many attempts have been done in order to find a possible plausible explanation to the coincidence problem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the second idea suggested in order to possibly explain the observed accelerated expansion of the universe involve de models ( reviewed in @xcite ) .",
    "in relativistic cosmology , the cosmic acceleration we are able to observe can be described by the mean of a perfect fluid which pressure and energy density , indicated with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , satisfy the relation given by @xmath8 .",
    "this kind of fluid is dubbed as dark energy ( de ) .",
    "the relation @xmath8 also tells us that the eos parameter of the fluid @xmath9 must be in agreement with the condition @xmath10 , while , from an observational point of view , it is a difficult work to constrain its exact value . the most direct evidence we have for the detection of de",
    "is obtained from observations of supernovae of a type ia ( sneia ) whose intrinsic luminosities can be safely considered practically uniform @xcite . if we assume that the de idea is the right one in order to explain the present expansion of the universe with accelerated rate , we must have that the largest amount of the total cosmic energy density @xmath11 must be concentrated in the two dark sectors , _",
    "i.e. _ dark energy ( de ) and dark matter ( dm ) which represent , according to recent cosmological observations , about the 70@xmath12 and about the 25@xmath12 of the total energy density @xmath11 of the present day universe @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ordinary baryonic matter we are able to observe with our scientific instruments contributes for only the 5@xmath12 of @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , the radiation density gives a contribution to the total cosmic energy density which we can safely consider negligible .",
    "many different models have been well studied in recent times to understand the exact nature of de .",
    "some of these models include tachyon , quintessence , k - essence , quintom , chaplygin gas , agegraphic de ( ade ) , nade and phantom .",

    "the cosmic acceleration has been also well studied by imposing the concept of modification of gravity @xcite .",
    "this new model of gravity ( predicted by string / m theory ) gives a very natural gravitational alternative to the idea of the presence of exotic components .",
    "the explanation of the phantom , non - phantom and quintom phases of the universe can be well described using modified gravity theories without the necessity of the introduction of a negative kinetic term in de models .",
    "the relevance of modified gravity models for the late acceleration of the universe has been recently studied by many authors .",
    "some of the most famous and known models of modified gravity are represented by braneworld models , @xmath23 modified gravity ( where @xmath24 indicates the torsion scalar ) , @xmath25 modified gravity ( where @xmath26 indicates the ricci scalar curvature ) , @xmath27 modified gravity ( where @xmath28 indicates the gauss - bonnet invariant which is defined as @xmath29 , with @xmath26 representing the ricci scalar curvature , @xmath30 representing the ricci curvature tensor and @xmath31 representing the riemann curvature tensor ) , @xmath32 modified gravity , @xmath33 modified gravity , dgp model , dbi models , horava - lifshitz gravity and brans - dicke gravity . modified theories of gravity have been reviewed in @xcite .    recently , the idea that our universe is a brane which is embedded in a higher - dimensional space obtained a lot of attention from scientific community @xcite .",

    "saridakis @xcite studied a generalized version of the hde model arguing that it must be taked into account in the maximally subspace of a cosmological model ; moreover he showed that , in the framework of brane cosmology , it leads to a bulk hde which transfers its holographic nature to the effective @xmath36 de .",
    "furthermore , saridakis @xcite applied the bulk hde in general @xmath37 two - brane models and he also extracted the friedmann equation on the physical brane , showing that in the general moving - brane case the effective @xmath36 hde has a quintom - like behavior for a large parameter - space area of a simple solution subclass .    in this paper",
