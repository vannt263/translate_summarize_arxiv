    "in a recent workshop convened in aspen , rob kennicutt gave a striking summary of the convergence of estimates of the hubble constant and the corresponding shrinking of error bars .",
    "one of the most important contributions of the hubble space telescope has been , for the first time , accurate estimates of the errors . as kennicutt pointed to a plot of the value of the hubble constant",
    "versus time since 1990 and the convergence of estimates to a value in the mid to high 60 s ( in units of km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 ) one of the authors of this paper ( jcw ) piped up to say ,  i knew that , \" and kennicutt , without missing a beat , his back to the audience , said ",
    "i knew some butthead would claim he knew the right value all along . \"",
    "one purpose of this review is to summarize the arguments that have led theorists studying physical models of type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) to predict that when the dust settled , the hst key project would find the hubble constant to be @xmath2 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , as has , in fact , been the case .",
    "there is some cause for taking this expected but welcome confirmation as proof that we are on the right track in our interpretation of the physical nature of sn ia and encouragement to employ our growing physical understanding to determine the systematic effects that are expected to dominate the use of sn ia to determine the deceleration parameter and perhaps even the cosmological constant .",
    "the status of work on sn ia is given in  2 .",
    "the use of type ii supernovae ( sn ii ) as a complementary tool to measure the hubble constant is discussed in  3 .",
    "a brief summary is given in  4 .",
    "the standard model of a sn ia is a thermonuclear explosion of a carbon / oxygen white dwarf . to first order , models for such an explosion put constraints on the luminosity that in turn constrain the hubble constant .",
    "the reason is that the nuclear energy liberated has two correlated , but independently measurable effects .",
    "the energy of the explosion determines the expansion velocity which can be determined from the doppler shift of spectral features .",
    "the energy is supplied by burning carbon and oxygen to intermediate mass and iron - peak elements .",
    "the principle iron peak element produced is that having equal numbers of protons and neutrons , as does the fuel , and that is .",
    "the decay of and its daughter product , however , determine the bolometric luminosity of the explosion with dominating near maximum light .",
    "thus , to first order , the amount of and hence the luminosity , is closely related to the expansion velocity .",
    "this correlation was pointed out by sutherland & wheeler ( 1984 ) and its direct implications for the hubble constant were summarized by arnett , branch , & wheeler ( 1985 ) .",
    "it was not possible at that time to put precise limits on the hubble constant because of simplifications and some uncertainties in the radiative transfer , but some limits were clear .",
    "if the amount of nuclear burning were too low , then the white dwarf could not be unbound , never mind give the requisite expansion velocity of @xmath0 10,000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this meant that this class of model could not be consistent with a hubble constant of 100 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 and even 70 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 caused some discomfort . at the other extreme",
    ", such a model could not produce more than its entire mass , a chandrasekhar mass , of .",
    "this constraint and the observation that rise times of sne  ia are at least 2 weeks , put an absolute upper limit on the brightness and a lower limit on h@xmath3 of 40 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 .",
    "this is clearly an unphysical lower limit because we know from the spectrum that a substantial portion of the outer layers of the ejecta of an sn ia are not iron peak , but intermediate mass elements .",
    "exactly how outrageous this lower limit was could not be assessed precisely at the time , but a model with about 0.6 @xmath4 of nickel ( model w7 of nomoto , thielemann , & yokoi 1984 ) gave a reasonable light curve and , even more importantly , spectrum ( harkness 1986 , 1991 ) .",
    "the luminosity of this model applied to normalize the hubble diagram of sn ia implied that a preferred value of the hubble constant was @xmath0 60 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 .",
    "subsequent work has made crucial refinements in both the physics of the explosion and the sophistication of the radiative transfer that allows one to go from the bolometric luminosity given by radioactive decay to the observed multi - color light curves .",
    "this work brought a recent critical advance in understanding that kept pace with important observational developments .    on the observational side , the long suspected inhomogeneity of sne  ia ( pskovskii 1977 ) has been confirmed ( phillips 1993 ; hamuy , et al .",
    "there is no longer any basis for assuming they are intrinsically ideal  standard candles . \"",
    "rather , this inhomogeneity gives an opportunity for a deeper understanding of the underlying evolutionary and physical processes .",
    "this diversity must also be taken into account in using sne  ia to determine cosmological distance scales .",
    "this can be done to some extent by empirical methods ( riess , press , & kirshner 1996 ) , but a physical understanding is both intrinsically preferable and necessary to fully integrate the changing properties of sne  ia with the structure and evolution of their host galaxies .",
    "of particular interest is the light curve brightness / decline relation .",
    "observations show that the dimmer sne  ia decline more rapidly than brighter events ( phillips 1993 ; hamuy , et al . 1996 ) .",
    "a one - parameter version of this relation has been used to empirically calibrate sne  ia in the context of estimates of the hubble constant ( riess , press , & kirshner , 1996 ) and the deceleration parameter ( kim , et al .",
    "1996 ) , but one expects and observes scatter around the mean brightness / decline relation that must be understood and incorporated in further work .    on the physical side ,",
    "there have been important breakthroughs in understanding the possible nature of the thermonuclear combustion of sn ia .",
    "there is now strong reason to believe that the explosion proceeds from a phase driven by a subsonic turbulent combustion , a deflagration , followed by a transition to a shock - driven , supersonic detonation phase ( khokhlov 1991 ) .",
    "spherically symmetric models that treated the density at which this deflagration to detonation transition occurred as a free parameter revealed a new effect . the nuclear energy that gave rise to the expansion velocity",
    "could be provided by burning predominantly to intermediate mass elements , especially silicon . the critical nuclear energy to unbind the white dwarf and provide",
    "the expansion velocity is thus proportional to the sum of the si peak material and ni ( hflich , khokhlov & wheeler 1995 ) .",
    "depending on the value of the transition density , however , more or less would be produced which would in turn produce different values of the luminosity .",
    "this class of models , while generically closely related to earlier ones , broke the tight relation between the mass of and the expansion velocity .",
    "models with less ( but with substantial total thermonuclear energy release , @xmath0 10@xmath5 ergs ) were not only dimmer , but also cooler .",
    "the lower temperatures resulted in lower opacity and faster rates of decline .",
    "these models account qualitatively and even quantitatively for the observed brightness - decline rate relation ( hflich , khokhlov & wheeler 1995 ; hflich , et al .",
    "1996b ) .",
    "these new developments were applied to the determination of the hubble constant by hflich and khokhlov ( 1996 ) .",
    "this paper presented a large variety of models computed with different assumptions concerning the combustion physics , for each of which multi - color light curves were computed .",
    "the result was an ensemble of models from which one could chose the ones that best matched the observations , or , more precisely , one could reject models that clearly failed to match the observations .",
    "models that provided reasonable fits to the light curves around maximum in a wide variety of photometric bands constrain the luminosity rather tightly .",
    "thus one can estimate the brightness ( as well as reddening ) of each individual supernova and determine a corresponding point on the hubble diagram .",
    "the result is the currently best guess for the hubble constant using only physical models and observations of individual supernovae with no reference to local calibrators .",
    "the result obtained by hflich & khokhlov is 67@xmath69 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the error is a  2 @xmath7 \" value ( i.e. the 95 % probability limit for a non - gaussian error distribution ) obtained by assessing the probability that a given range of models fit a given supernova .",
    "the value and error estimate are in excellent accord with recent estimates of h@xmath3 based on distances to cepheid variables . from hst observations of @xmath8-cephei stars in ic4182 , ngc5253 , and ngc4536 distance moduli have been found to be @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 mag , respectively ( freedman , et al . 1994 ; sandage , et al .",
    "1994 ; tammann 1996 ) which also compare well with the estimates of hflich & khokhlov of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath11 mag , respectively .",
    "the spread for nearby sne  ia in fig .",
    "1 is consistent with the cobe dipole field .",
    "hflich & khokhlov were also able to show ( based on one very distant supernova , sn 1988u ) that @xmath14 does not vary significantly from redshift of 0.1 to 0.5 and to put rough limits on the deceleration parameter , q@xmath3 = 0.7@xmath61 .",
    "6.5 cm -4.0 cm    the bolometric luminosity in the models basically depends on the decay energies which are well known .",
    "the translation between total luminosity and brightness in a given band may be a point of concern .",
    "the bolometric correction , defined to be the conversion factor between the total luminosity and that in the v band , can be tested with observed spectra in a model - independent way because it depends only on the flux distribution .",
    "figure 2 gives the spectrum of sn 1992a and that of the sun normalized to give the same total flux .",
    "models give a bolometric correction of @xmath0 0.1@xmath15 , consistent with the normalized observed sn spectrum in the v band .",
    "a bc of 0.3 would clearly be too large to be inconsistent with the flux in the observed supernova spectrum in the v band .",
    "the models reproduce the empirical constraints on bc to within @xmath6 0.1@xmath15 , implying a systematic error of less than 10 % ( hflich & khokhlov 1996 ) .",
    "6.5 cm -6.cm    this work strongly suggests that the physical and radiative transfer models of sn ia are on the right track and can be used with some confidence in the next exciting phase as one attempts to use high redshift supernovae ( perlmutter , et al 1995 ; kim , et al .",
    "1996 ; schmidt 1997 ) to determine q@xmath3 and @xmath16 . with the great productivity of the distant supernova searches , internal errors due to",
    "small number statistics will soon become of vanishing significance .",
    "the critical issue will be to determine the systematic effects as one looks back to earlier eras when metallicities , progenitor evolution , even galaxy evolution may be significantly different .",
    "riess , press , & kirshner ( 1996 ) have shown the power of correcting for the brightness / decline relation . by so doing ,",
    "the scatter around the hubble flow line is reduced from @xmath17 if sn ia are assumed to be standard candles to @xmath18 if their multi - color techniques are used to determine peak luminosity .",
    "some reservation about this empirical technique has been expressed by noting that some of the nearest sn ia are the brightest , a distinctly counter - intuitive result .",
    "this needs to be better understood , but it is probably the result of low number statistics for nearby supernovae and the fact that spiral galaxies have , in the mean , somewhat brighter supernovae . the local sample is dominated by spiral galaxies .",
    "another aspect of this issue was recently uncovered by wang , hflich , & wheeler ( 1997 ) .",
    "they examined the radial distribution of supernovae in galaxies . using the well - calibrated calan - tololo sample of sn ia",
    ", they showed that at galactocentric radii less than @xmath19 kpc , sn ia show the full dispersion of peak luminosity reflected in the brightness / decline relation . beyond @xmath19 kpc ,",
    "however , the dispersion in peak brightness drops dramatically . the intrinsic dispersion with no correction whatever for the brightness / decline relation is @xmath20 , comparable to that obtained after correction by riess , et al .",
    "the reason for this remarkable change in the properties of sn ia demands explanation in terms of progenitor evolution , metallicity , etc .",
    "it suggests that their may yet be a way of picking a sample of sn ia which do represent nearly  standard candles , \" but it remains abundantly clear that this is not the case for the full sample of sn ia .",
    "future work , both on understanding the progenitor evolution and physics of sn ia and on purely empirical calibration methods must focus on departures from a one - parameter light curve brightness / decline relation . the observational data , for instance from the calan - tololo survey already show a dispersion that can not be fit by a one parameter curve ( hamuy , et al . 1996 , hflich , et al . 1996b ) .",
    "sn 1994d is a particular case in point .",
    "it is too bright and blue for its light curve shape ( hflich 1995a ) .",
    "there are also abundant theoretical reasons to think that there should be a scatter in properties in terms of initial metallicity , rotation , and mass accretion rate . even if the progenitor evolution is identical , the randomness associated with the site of ignition of carbon many points and with subsequent turbulent burning is sure to impose some dispersion of final properties .",
    "current work on the physics of sn ia promises deeper understanding of these issues",
    ". the carbon runaway will grow out of a preliminary phase of quasi - static convective carbon burning .",
    "the resulting dynamical runaway may start in the center or off center in one or many points ( so called  spotty ignition ) as determined by the temperature distribution on the convective phase .",
    "the first full 3-d calculations of the deflagration of a carbon / oxygen white dwarf have been done by khokhlov ( 1995 ) .",
    "these calculations show that the expansion and freezing of the flow is important and seems to be consistent with models in which expansion quenches the subsonic deflagration , thus allowing a turbulent mixing of warm ash and cold fuel .",
    "subsequent recompression is likely to trigger a detonation .",
    "this problem of deflagration to detonation transition is currently under intense study ( khokhlov , oran , & wheeler 1997a , b ; niemeyer and woosley 1997 ) .",
    "future 3-d calculations will use adaptive mesh techniques to extend the resolution of the turbulent flame to the scale where turbulence disrupts the laminar flame ( the  gibson \" scale ) to provide a more accurate model of the turbulent burning phase and a natural transition to detonation .",
    "these models should go a long way to removing the current free parameter of the transition density from deflagration to detonation and leave the progenitor evolution as the major unknown .",
    "5.5 cm -2.6 cm = 5.5 cm    9.0 cm -2.5 cm = 8.5 cm    the explosion will inevitably be a function of the redshift and hence age of the host galaxy , the mass accretion rate , metallicity , rotation and other factors .",
    "an example of how the metallicity could alter the resulting spectrum is given in figure 3 from hflich , et al ( 1997 ) . in this calculation , the metallicity of the progenitor white dwarf is varied from solar to 1/3 solar .",
    "it is important to note that this variation must be imposed on the progenitor , not added after the explosion , because it changes the nucleosynthesis during the explosion .",
    "the principle effect is to alter the iron peak abundances and these in turn primarily affect the spectrum in the blue .",
    "one result of this is substantially different colors , say b - v , as the small differences in the rest frame u band spectra are redshifted to b and then to v. figure 3 shows that the differences in b - v can be up to @xmath21 .",
    "some groups doing supernova searches at large redshifts ( perlmutter , et al , 1995 ) search only in the ccd band and clearly will have to account for such variations .",
    "other groups ( schmidt 1997 ) , employ specially constructed filters so that they are effectively always looking at the rest frame v band .",
    "even with this technique , care must be taken that the red - shifted filter matches the standard v - band filter ( whatever standard one chooses ) and that the match remains precise over the observed redshift range .",
    "sn ii represent an important complement to sn ia as a technique to measure cosmological distances . in principle",
    ", the distance to each individual sn ii can be measured by the  baade - wesslink \" or ",
    "expanding photosphere \" method ( note the photosphere actually retreats in mass with time ) in which the ratio of the observed apparent flux to the intrinsic absolute flux gives the anglular size and the velocity and elapsed time give the radius .",
    "the critical aspect of this method is to determine the intrinsic flux of the atmosphere where scattering effects are important . in simple terms , scattering results in a ",
    "dilute black body \" and this dilution factor which is , in general , a function of frequency and time , must be determined .",
    "schmidt , et al ( 1994 ) have computed the behavior of this dilution factor over a range of temperatures and for a variety of models and have compared their results to sn 1987a and other sn ii .",
    "their dilution factor is unity at low temperatures , drops rather rapidly by a factor of about 4 by 9000 k , and then remains constant at higher temperatures .",
    "this dilution factor has been used to determine the distances to a number of sn ii and to derive an estimate of the hubble constant , h@xmath3 = 73 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 .",
    "there are a number of reasons to think that this issue can benefit from further examination .",
    "the power of this method was illustrated by sn1987a where many groups agreed within 10 % in distance ( @xmath22 5 kpc , chilukuri & wagoner 1988 ; @xmath23 4 kpc , hflich 1987 , 1988 ; @xmath24 4 kpc , schmutz , et al .",
    "1990 ; @xmath25 5 kpc , eastman & kirshner 1989 ) .",
    "this was , however , by far the best observed sn with good time coverage and knowledge of the time of the explosion . for the baade - wesselink method , exact knowledge of the time of the explosion can be important .",
    "the error in the distance scales as @xmath26/t .",
    "typically , the time of the explosions of other supernovae are only known to within a few days at best , implying an error of @xmath27 in the first few weeks . later on ,",
    "when this source of error becomes small , the photospheres of sn ii tend to be about 5000 k in the recombination phase of the plateau which puts the dilution factor on the steeply declining part of the function .",
    "this clearly calls for especially careful treatment , by fitting individual supernovae . although all groups ( hflich 1991 , schmidt , et al .",
    "1994 , baron , et al .",
    "1995 ) agree on the general relation between dilution factor and photospheric temperature including the change of the dilution factor during the recombination phase , hflich ( 1991 ) and baron , et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found a value of the dilution factor for high temperatures ( i.e. @xmath0 9000k ) that was higher by about 30 and 50 % , respectively , than that of schmidt , et al .",
    "the estimate of baron , et al . was in the context of sn 1993j , not a standard sn ii , but their models were rather generic .",
    "moreover , depending on the model parameters , both hflich and baron , et al . found larger scatter around the mean , even at large temperatures , than schmidt , et al .",
    "clocchiatti , et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found that in the early stages of the expansion of the fireball of sn 1993j , the atmosphere was hot , @xmath28 k , but the dilution factor was essentially unity , in sharp contrast with the asymptotic value of schmidt , et al .",
    "the difference can be attributed to the apparent steep density profile of the atmosphere of sn 1993j ( brick walls radiate like black bodies ) , but this result suggests another cause for caution .",
    "the range of estimates of the dilution factor by schmidt , et al .",
    ", hflich , and baron , et al . might be regarded as the intrinsic range in uncertainty . at the very least the source of these discrepancies",
    "should be understood .",
    "the ability of polarimetry of supernovae to give unique information about intrinsic asymmetries has long been discussed ( shapiro & sutherland 1982 ; mccall , et al . 1984 ) .",
    "sn 1987a also represented a breakthrough in this area by providing the first detailed record of the spectropolarimetric evolution ( mendez , et al .",
    "1988 ; cropper , et al .",
    "sn 1993j also provided a wealth of data which is still being analyzed ( trammell , hines , & wheeler 1993 ; hflich 1995b ; doroshenko , et al .",
    "1995 ; hflich , et al .",
    "1996a ; tran , et al .",
    "more recently we have begun a program at mcdonald observatory to attempt to get routine spectropolarimetry on all accessible supernovae .",
    "this program has nearly doubled the number of supernovae for which polarimetry is available .",
    "the early qualitative conclusion was that all type ii are polarized at about the 1 percent level and that type ia are much less polarized , less than 0.1 - 0.2 percent .",
    "( wang , et al . 1996 ) .",
    "that trend continues without exception .",
    "there are a number of ways in which the emission from supernovae could be polarized .",
    "there could be asymmetries associated with the circumstellar medium , especially aided by the large scattering cross section of dust ( wang & wheeler 1996 ) .",
    "there could be asymmetries in the ejecta that reflect initial distortions in the outer envelope due to rotation , filling a roche lobe , or other influences ( hflich 1991 ; jeffery 1991 ) .",
    "a symmetric explosion in an envelope distorted by rotation or by filling a roche lobe can give a prolate envelope and an oblate core ( steinmetz & hflich 1992 ) .",
    "the reason is that shocks first propagate up the axis where the density gradient is steeper , but then sideways to the equatorial axis where they meet and eject matter in the equatorial plane giving a prolate , pancake - like geometry .",
    "pressure waves are then sent into the core by momentum conservation , compressing the core along the equatorial plane .",
    "this tends to yield an oblate , cigar - shaped core .",
    "both a distortion of the envelope and dust scattering may have played a role in sn 1987a . if the source of illumination is off - center even in an otherwise spherically symmetric density distribution , the emergent light will be polarized ( hflich 1995b ) .",
    "this type of asymmetry is also established in other ways in sn 1987a and , to a certain extent , in sn 1993j .",
    "finally , and perhaps most importantly , the intrinsic explosion process , core collapse or thermonuclear explosion , may impose asymmetry .",
    "the polarization of sn ic 1997x , a bare , non - degenerate carbon / oxygen core , may give strong indication of this effect .",
    "polarimetry may thus provide a unique ability to determine the asymmetry of the explosion mechanism and hence special constraints on the physics of the explosion independent of any subsequent instabilities or other symmetry - breaking phenomena .",
    "the first several sn  ii events with confirmed polarization , sn 1987a , sn 1993j , sn 1994y ( a narrow emission line event ) , were odd in some way , so there was some question of whether the trend identified by wang , et al ( 1996 ) that all sn  ii were substantially polarized was due to a sample that was unrepresentative of normal sn  ii .",
    "observations of sn 1996w help to remove that concern .",
    "sn 1996w was a perfectly normal type ii plateau event .",
    "it was observed shortly after the first  hump \" in the visual at the very early stage of the plateau at the beginning of the recombination wave phase .",
    "sn 1996w , like the other sn  ii , was polarized at about the 1 percent level .",
    "because sn  iip are bright red supergiants with very large envelopes , rotational distortion of the envelope seems unlikely and any dust - scattered light should be rather dilute .",
    "the envelope should be very optically thick at the observed phase , so it is unlikely that any effect of off - center nickel blobs would be manifest .",
    "this may mean that the polarization observed in sn 1996w was due to some asymmetry associated with the explosion process .",
    "the observations of sn 1996w imply that polarization of sn ii is ubiquitous .",
    "this conclusion may have implications for use of sn ii to measure the distance scale . to generate the observed polarizations , envelope distortions of 10 - 50 percent are required ( hflich 1995b ) , although this may not be necessary in dust scattering models . for such distortions , the luminosity can be strongly asymmetric with differences of up to a factor two along the polar and equatorial directions . if the asymmetric luminosity were distributed in the same way as orientation on the sky , this would have no affect on a large sample of supernovae , because the effect would average out .",
    "the luminosity is not , however , a linear function of the inclination angle .",
    "therefore , the distribution of luminosity could have a net systematic bias which will affect the use of sn ii to make distance estimates .",
    "further study of the polarization of supernovae is thus warranted in this regard .",
    "the most recent estimate for the value of the hubble constant by the hubble key project ( freedman , et al .",
    "1997 ) is 67@xmath29(internal)@xmath30(systematic ) km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 . in this work , local distances based on cepheid variables",
    "are extrapolated out to the hubble flow using the tully - fisher relation , the surface brightness fluctuation method or sn  ia , all of which provide the same relative distances .",
    "the issue has been the absolute calibration , which the cepheids are now providing .",
    "note that it is somewhat circular to use empirical determinations of sn ia as one means of extrapolation when this technique is itself dependent on the cepheids to determine the absolute scale . in any case",
    ", the two methods agree .",
    "riess , press , & kirshner get h@xmath3 = 67@xmath30 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 . in an important complementary study , sandage , et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have determined the distances to cepheid variables that have specifically been host to sn  ia .",
    "they have obtained h@xmath3 = 56@xmath31(internal ) km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 based on b magnitudes , and h@xmath3 = 58@xmath31(internal ) km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 based on v magnitudes for the sn  ia .",
    "this analysis assumes that sn  ia are standard candles , which is not valid .",
    "a correction for the brightness / decline relation would give a value that is quite consistent with those quoted above .",
    "the current empirical values for the hubble constant based on sn ia and cepheids are consistent with the value obtained by direct comparison of models with observations of sn ia with no reference to local calibrators , h@xmath3 = 67@xmath32 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 ( hflich & khokhlov 1996 ) .",
    "further work on the physics of the explosion and the use of spectral , rather than broad band , evolution should be able to reduce the error in this method .",
    "using sn  ii , schmidt , et al ( 1994 ) obtain h@xmath3 = 73@xmath33(internal)@xmath34(systematic ) km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent , within the errors , with estimates based on sn  ia .",
    "if , however , the dilution factor of baron , et al ( 1994 ) were used at face value , this estimate would drop to h@xmath3 @xmath0 50 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 and with that of hflich ( 1991 ) , the value would be h@xmath3 @xmath0 65 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 . some improvement could probably be made in the estimates based on sn ii , including possible systematic effects of asymmetries .",
    "improvements are still necessary , but discussion of the hubble constant concerns uncertainties of 10 - 20 percent , no longer a factor of two .",
    "recent developments show that things are still somewhat in a state of flux on the observational side .",
    "there is a rumor that hipparchos will recalibrate the distances to cepheids and increase the distance scale by @xmath010 percent ; however , kochanek ( 1997 ) has examined the color effects of the cepheid period / luminosity relation and deduced that the distance scale must be decreased by @xmath010 percent .",
    "these effects may prove to cancel , or one or the other may be otherwise qualified .",
    "a colleague recently remarked that the theoretically - based methods using either sn ia or sn ii are doing quite well and if the observations threaten to depart from those results , one should question the observations .",
    "this is no time for the theorists to lose heart !",
    "we thank our colleagues at rice for the opportunity to summarize these issues and numerous colleagues who work on the distance scale for stimulating discussions over many years .",
