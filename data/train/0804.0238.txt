    "x - ray spectra of galactic black hole candidates ( gbhcs ) are an important tool in the studies of the inner regions of accretion flow around black holes ( bhs ) , providing information on both the geometry of the accretion disc and on intrinsic physical parameters such as bh mass and spin .    the spectrum can be explained by the combination of a quasi - thermal blackbody component     caused by radiatively efficient accretion through a disc ( shimura & takahara 1995 ; merloni , fabian & ross 2000 ) , a power - law component due to inverse compton scattering of the soft thermal disc photons in a cloud of hot electrons or `` corona '' ( zdziarski & gierlinski 2004 ) , and a reflection component ( ross & fabian 1993 ) .",
    "the latter arises as hard emission from the corona irradiates the cooler disc below and results in `` reflection signatures '' consisting of fluorescent and recombination emission lines as well as absorption features .",
    "the most prominent of these `` signatures '' is the broad , skewed fe-  line observed in a number of gbhcs and active galactic nuclei ( agns , see miller 2007 for a recent review ) indicative of reflection from the innermost regions of an accretion disc .    in the inner regions of an accretion disc the iron  line shape is distorted by various relativistic effects such as gravitational redshift , light - bending , frame - dragging and doppler shifts , with the effects becoming more prominent the closer the line is emitted to the event horizon ( fabian et al .",
