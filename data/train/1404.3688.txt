    "two dimensional spiral waves are observed in many different situations @xcite . in excitable biological tissue such as the cerebral cortex ,",
    "the myocardium or the retina , spirals are usually precursors to serious pathological conditions @xcite .",
    "thus there is great interest in understanding the dynamics of spiral waves , and how these are affected by model parameters and interactions with medium imperfections .",
    "one of the most important theoretical breakthroughs in the study of spiral waves has been the adoption of techniques from group - equivariant dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "typically the physical systems in which spirals are observed are modeled using systems of reaction - diffusion partial differential equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a function @xmath2 which can represent a vector of concentrations , electrical potentials , _ et cetera _ depending on the system being modeled .",
    "the function @xmath3 models local reaction dynamics , @xmath4 is an @xmath5 matrix of diffusion coefficients , and @xmath6 are model parameters .    equation ( [ rdpde1 ] ) is invariant under the full euclidean group of planar rotations and translations , @xmath7 ( in fact , they are also invariant under reflections in space , but for our purposes , this symmetry will not be useful ) . rigidly and uniformly rotating spiral waves are now well - understood to be _ rotating wave _ solutions of ( [ rdpde1 ] ) in the sense of equivariant dynamical systems @xcite ; that is , evolution in time is the same as a uniform spatial rotation of the initial condition about some point in space .",
    "this fact has led to a model - independent understanding of many of the observed dynamical states and bifurcations of spirals , e.g. transition to meandering , resonant linear drifting @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of applications , equation ( [ rdpde1 ] ) and the associated symmetry describes a highly idealized situation which is almost never achieved in reality : infinite planar domain which is both homogeneous and isotropic . in practice ,",
    "media of propagation are finite in extent , so boundaries can play a significant role .",
    "also , especially in excitable biological tissue , there are many potential sources of anisotropy and inhomogeneities .",
    "many experiments ( both numerical and physical ) have shown that these imperfections have a significant impact on the dynamics of spiral waves @xcite    using a model - independent dynamical systems formulation based on the idea of forced symmetry - breaking from @xmath7 to a proper subgroup of @xmath7 , many of these effects ( which result from inhomogeneities and/or anisotropy ) can be explained in terms of simple dynamics and bifurcations @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "this approach has even led to some predictions which have been later confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is this forced symmetry - breaking approach that we wish to pursue in this paper .",
    "specifically , we will be interested in cases in which the euclidean symmetry of ( [ rdpde1 ] ) is broken by a small perturbation which preserves only the symmetry of a regular square lattice . at the cellular level , excitable biological tissues exhibit inhomogeneities in conduction via the gap junctions which separate the cells @xcite . in cases where the spatial scale of the spiral wave is comparable to the cellular scale , it is not unreasonable to assume that the conduction inhomogeneities caused by these gap junctions may have an impact on the dynamics of the spiral .",
    "moreover , if one wants to investigate these effects , a reasonable simplifying first order approximation is to assume that the cells are distributed in a regular lattice array .",
    "see also @xcite for further motivation . based on the results of @xcite , we expect that the lattice may have stabilising ( anchoring ) effects on the spirals and/or induce meandering",
    ". these expectations will indeed be consequences of our results in this paper .    at some phenomenological level",
    ", it is also expected that our results may be a first step in understanding potential numerical effects induced by spatial - discretization of the domain for integrations of reaction - diffusion partial differential equations .",
    "of course in most situations , we expect that numerical discretization effects will be negligeable if the spatial grid is fine enough",
    ". however , coarse grids ( relative to the spatial scale of the spiral ) could have effects on the observed dynamics , and our work here could point to what these effects may be . in a specific instance",
    ", we argue that forced lattice symmetry - breaking gives results which are consistent with numerically - observed transition from rigidly rotating wave to linearly translating waves ( with retracted tip ) as the rotation frequency of the spiral wave tends to zero @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we establish the symmetry properties we wish to consider , and derive the main center - bundle equations which represent the dynamics on perturbed relative equilibria ( i.e. rotating or travelling waves ) in the context of lattice forced symmetry - breaking . in section 3 , we recall a classic result by hale on averaging and the existence of invariant manifolds for perturbed systems , in a form suitable for our purposes .",
    "section 4 deals with the effects of lattice symmetry - breaking perturbations on rotating spiral waves , and section 5 considers the effects of the perturbation on travelling waves .",
    "we illustrate some of our results with numerical simulations which are presented in section 6 .",
    "the proofs of our two main results are presented in appendices a and b.",
    "let @xmath7 denote the set of all planar translations and rotations , parametrized as follows @xmath8 and whose action on a point @xmath9 , is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11    it thus follows that the group composition is the semi - direct product @xmath12    we will denote by @xmath13 the following subgroup of @xmath7 , which represents the symmetry of a regular square lattice @xmath14    let @xmath15 be a banach space , and suppose @xmath16 is a faithful and isometric representation of @xmath7 in the space of bounded , invertible linear operators on @xmath15 . for example ,",

    "we will assume certain compatibility conditions between the evolution equation ( [ basicpde ] ) and the actions of @xmath7 and @xmath13 on @xmath15 via the representation ( [ aaction ] ) .",

    "thus , in the @xmath39  @xmath163 parameter space of ( [ cmeqs1 ] ) , there exists a region @xmath164 which resembles qualitatively figure [ retreg ] ( see also figure 4 of @xcite for an analogous phenomenon ) with the following properties :    * outside @xmath164 where @xmath163 dominates @xmath39 , the results of section 4 apply and there are no stable travelling waves for ( [ cmeqs1 ] ) * on the boundary of @xmath164 , stable travelling waves ( invariant two - tori ) are created via saddle - node bifurcation , * in the interior of @xmath164 where @xmath39 dominates @xmath163 , theorem [ thmtravwave ] applies and there may exist transverse zeros of the function @xmath165 which correspond to invariant two - tori @xmath166 for ( [ cmeqs1 ] ) .",

    "suppose an experimental parameter @xmath167 is varied continuously in such a way that in the @xmath101 equation of ( [ cmeqs1 ] ) , @xmath168 decreases as illustrated in the dashed line of figure [ retreg ] .",
    "the following may be observed in physical space . as @xmath163 decreases",
    "while remaining above the top boundary of @xmath164 , the spiral tip will undergo a periodic motion .",
    "however , when @xmath163 crosses the boundary of @xmath164 , the wave will stop rotating and start drifting linearly , due to a saddle - node bifurcation of zeros in the function @xmath165 .",
    "moreover , this linear motion will persist as the experimental parameter @xmath167 is further varied while @xmath163 stays in the interior of @xmath164 .",
    "see also @xcite for a similar scenario in the case of rotational symmetry - breaking for spiral waves .",
    "the above scenario is reminiscent of the experimentally observed phenomenon of retracting spiral waves . in certain numerical experiments on spiral waves @xcite",
    ", it has been observed that as an experimental parameter is varied , the rotation frequency of a rotating spiral wave decreases , the spiral core unwinds and the radius of the circular motion grows unbounded , eventually reaching a state where the spiral is completely unwound , and the tip drifts linearly ( retracts ) when the rotation frequency approaches zero .",
    "as the experimental parameter is further varied , the spiral remains unwound and the linearly drifting state persists in an asymptotically stable manner .    in @xcite",

    "then , as is shown in @xcite , as @xmath163 decreases , the circular spiral tip motion grows unbounded like @xmath169 .",
    "however , since the intersection of the region @xmath164 with the @xmath163-axis consists solely of the point @xmath140 , the analysis predicts that the linearly translating wave exists only for @xmath140 ( i.e. it is not asymptotically stable , and does not persist under further variation of the parameter ) .",
    "this prediction is inconsistent with the above - described experiments on retracting spirals @xcite .",
    "if one considers a situation where euclidean symmetry is broken ( i.e. @xmath24 ) , then , as our analysis reveals , asymptotically stable travelling waves near @xmath140 are possible .",
    "we note that the pde model which is integrated in @xcite is fully euclidean symmetric ; however , the spatial discretization schemes which are used to perform the numerical integrations break the symmetry but preserve a lattice symmetry . we qualify these remarks with two important caveats .",
    "first , if indeed euclidean symmetry - breaking ( e.g. of a numerical type ) were responsible for the experimentally observed retracting tip phenomenon ( we are not claiming that it is ) , then the rotation of the spiral just before the transition to linear translation would be markedly non - uniform . as far as we are aware , this non - uniformity is not observed .",
    "second , as was the case in @xcite , the center bundle equations ( [ cmeqs1 ] ) predict that as @xmath163 is further varied ( beyond the region @xmath164 ) , the spiral should start rotating in the opposite direction .",
    "this does not appear to be what happens in the experiments : as the experimental parameter is further varied , the excitability of the medium is eventually diminished to an extent where wave propagation is no longer possible @xcite .",
