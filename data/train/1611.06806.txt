    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and especially the blazar sub - class , are well known emitters of tev @xmath0-ray emission , which is generally assumed to be produced in the jet by relativistic electrons through inverse compton scatterings .",
    "the production site of the tev emission is often considered to be within the first few parsecs of the jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at these small distances , the influence of the optical broad line region and the infrared dusty torus on the emission of the blazar can be significant for both serving as seed photon fields for the inverse compton process and at the same time absorbing the @xmath0-rays produced in the jet .",
    "the resulting absorption features have been used to constrain the location of the @xmath0-ray emission region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this deduction assumes that further absorption within the photon fields of the host galaxy can be neglected .    beyond the central region",

    "* hereafter s06 ) derived the optical depth for tev photons emerging from the central region in the nearby active galaxy centaurus  a ( cen  a ) , and obtained a maximum value on the order of @xmath5 .",
    "as these authors note , this seemingly low value already produces distinctive radiative features .",
    "the absorbed radiation is reprocessed in electron - positron cascades and could become visible as a @xmath0-ray halo of the size of the galaxy .    since the absorption by starlight is inevitable irrespective of the type of active galaxy ( i.e. , whether or not it contains strong central photon sources such as a broad - line region ) , it is important to understand the potential impact of the host galaxy on the observed spectrum of the active nucleus .",
    "depending on the strength of the absorption this can influence the modeling and interpretation of a large range of quantities , from jet internal parameters , such as the electron spectral index , to parameters of the central photon fields .",
    "it is important to note that agn like cen  a , m  87 and others have been detected at tev energies despite being no blazars .",
    "they potentially exhibit a curved jet , and therefore different amounts of beaming at different positions in the jet . as a consequence the @xmath0-rays",
    "might be emitted non - radially with respect to the galactic center and thus take a longer path through the starlight photon field .",
    "it is worth investigating whether the viewing angle has consequences on the amount of absorption .",
    "furthermore , recent investigations on the low frequency peaked bl lac object ap librae have resulted in contrary locations of the @xmath0-ray emission region .",
    "ap librae has been detected at tev energies by the h.e.s.s .",
    "experiment @xcite despite its classification , where no tev emission is expected .",
    "the standard blazar one - zone model therefore fails .",
    "@xcite argue for an emission region close to the central black hole , while @xcite invoke the observed kpc - scale radio and x - ray jet as the origin of the tev emission .",
    "given that ap librae s host galaxy is relatively bright , the different levels of absorption by the starlight photon field expected for these scenarios could help to solve this mystery .",
    "so far , the absorption of tev radiation by galactic starlight has been treated either for special cases ( as in s06 ) or in an approximated way ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "here we use the approach of s06 and expand it for arbitrary locations and observing angles of the @xmath0-ray emission site within the host galaxy . in section 2",
    "we derive the respective equations , and perform a parameter study . in section 3 we calculate the degree of absorption for a sample of tev detected blazars .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "the dust between the stars might also emit enough infrared photons to cause absorption at multi - tev energies .",
    "however , we will neglect the effect of the dust , since most agn emit at less than a few tev , where the absorption by infrared photons is irrelevant .",
    "generally , the optical depth @xmath6 is the path integral with respect to the soft photon density @xmath7 folded by the pair production cross section @xmath8 . retracing and expanding the steps of s06 will lead us to the degree of absorption of @xmath0-rays produced at an arbitrary location within the galaxy observed under an arbitrary observation angle with respect to the radial direction out of the galaxy .",
    "we assume that the galaxy is spherically symmetric .",

    "nevertheless , for an emission region at @xmath82 the optical depths is still at @xmath83 of the central value . in our template galaxy",
    ", this corresponds to a distance of @xmath84pc from the black hole . for @xmath85 ,",
    "i.e. an emission region located beyond the half - light radius , the absorption becomes irrelevant compared to the inner regions , since the absorption is smaller than @xmath86 of the central value .",
    "thus , most of the absorption happens in the inner regions of the galaxy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] ( b ) we show the dependence on the observation angle @xmath33 for three values of the distance @xmath40 , namely @xmath87 ( blue line ) , @xmath88 ( black line ) , and @xmath89 ( red line ) .",
    "the galactic size is again set to @xmath80 . in all cases ,",
    "the lowest absorption takes place for @xmath74 , while for @xmath90 the absorption can be several times larger .",
    "this is expected , since for @xmath74 the photons take the shortest route out of the galaxy , while for @xmath90 they travel the longest possible way and have to cross the bright central region of the galaxy .",
    "however , for a large range of observation angles the absorption does not change significantly , since the bright central region is only crossed for very large observation angles ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the magnitude of the change for different viewing angles depends sensitively on @xmath40 .",
    "for @xmath92 the curve becomes flat , while for @xmath93 the ratio between the highest and lowest value increases strongly .",
    "this also means that a counter - jet in an agn becomes more difficult to observe in the tev domain , since apart from the strong de - beaming effect its photons are more strongly attenuated than the photons of the approaching jet .",
    "this is especially true for regions with larger distances to the core .",
    "this point might become more important once the angular resolution of @xmath0-ray observatories is good enough to resolve jet structures .",
    "nevertheless , it is obvious that for most agn observations the viewing angle only has a minor influence on the degree of absorption by the starlight photon field .",
    "for the third case , @xmath6 as a function of @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] ( c ) ) , @xmath38 is kept fixed at @xmath94 cm , i.e. @xmath95 decreases for increasing @xmath60 .",
    "the emissivity is normalized by the total luminosity of the benchmark case .",
    "hence , for all values of the half - light radius , the integrated flux is the same . since the relationship between the luminosity and the emissivity scales as @xmath96 and the absorption in eq .",
    "( [ eq : taugammagammagen ] ) with @xmath97 , the fixed luminosity results roughly in an inverse dependence of the absorption with the half - light radius .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] ( c ) , where the emission region is located again at the galactic center , @xmath54 .",
    "the inverse relation of the absorption with the half - light radius is reasonable , given that by definition half of the light is emitted within the half - light radius .",
    "therefore , with increasing half - light radius the starlight within the half - light radius becomes more diluted , dropping the degree of absorption .",
    "the dependence of the absorption on the galactic size @xmath41 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] ( d ) .",
    "this case displays the complementary trend of fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] ( a ) .",
    "given that the normalization of the profile is the same for each value of @xmath41 ( since @xmath60 is fixed ) , the resulting curve demonstrates how different integration lengths from the emission region influence the absorption .",
    "naturally , for increasing galactic size the absorption increases , since the @xmath0-rays have to pass through more light .",
    "however , due to the nature of the radial profile , namely that at larger distances from the core the starlight density decreases , at radii @xmath98 the influence of the added starlight becomes negligible .",
    "this is shown by the curve flattening out and seemingly approaching an asymptotic value .",
    "this seems counter - intuitive , given that the half - light radius by definition contains only half of the total luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "however , the starlight density at larger radii is so low that the chance of a @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction rapidly decrease .",
    "hence , the outer parts of the galaxy beyond the half - light radius only have a minor influence on the absorption .",
    "summarizing , a high value of the total luminosity and a low value of the half - light radius favor a high degree of absorption .",
    "as long as the galactic size is greater than the half - light radius , the former does not influence the result . naturally , a larger distance of the emission region from the galactic center reduces the degree of absorption , while a larger viewing angle increases it .",
    "however , for most observation angles , the difference is low and can be safely ignored .",
    "the maximum degree of absorption by the starlight of the benchmark galaxy on the blazar emission is on the order of @xmath4 .",
    "however , whether this effect is detectable does not only depend on the accuracy of the observed spectra , but also on the intrinsic properties of the blazar source and its redshift .",
    "we calculated some model synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) spectra with different sets of parameters , to qualitatively study the effect of the absorption .",
    "we have used the code by @xcite , where the broken power - law electron distribution is derived self - consistently , i.e. the break electron lorentz factor is derived from the injection parameters , and the spectral index above the break is fixed to @xmath99 with @xmath100 being the injection spectral index . the electron distribution is bounded by a lower and upper electron lorentz factor ; @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "the break electron lorentz factor depends on the magnetic field @xmath103 and the size @xmath104 of the emission region .",

    "the absorption effect is more pronounced for harder spectra in the tev regime . for spectra cutting off below @xmath109tev ( blue curve )",
    ", the absorption can not be detected .",
    "for sources cutting off at a few tev , the potential for seeing the absorption depends strongly on the steepness of the spectrum .",
    "the black and the red curve almost cut off at the same energy , and yet the absorption is easier to detect in the red curve , since its flatter slope at @xmath78tev enhances the visibility of the absorption compared to the black curve . in case of the green curve , where the maximum of the ssc flux is attained at a few tev ,",
    "the absorption is clearly visible , since the highest degree of absorption roughly coincides with the highest ssc flux . in this case , the quality of the observed spectrum is the biggest uncertainty .",
    "so far we have neglected the influence of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , which softens vhe spectra .",

    ", the absorption increases monotonically with increasing observation angle and is maximal for @xmath90 .    while keeping the total luminosity of the template galaxy constant , we varied the half - light radius and studied its influence on the degree of absorption",
    ". the absorption increases for smaller half - light radii , since more light is concentrated in the inner regions of the galaxy , which increases the density of the starlight photons .",
    "the influence of the galactic size describes the cumulative absorption tev photons exhibit while traveling outward .",
    "the degree of absorption increases until the half - light radius , beyond which it reaches an asymptotic value .",
    "this is the same statement as above , namely that the additional absorption beyond the half - light radius is insignificant .",
    "the benchmark galaxy gives an absorption of @xmath135 .",
    "we analyzed the effect on theoretical spectra of blazars .",
    "we derived ssc spectra for different sets of parameters and applied the absorption .",
    "the effect is best detectable for blazars that exhibit a flat sed in the tev range , such as hbl sources . the softer the spectrum in the tev range , the more difficult is the detection of the absorption effect .",
    "given that the maximum absorption is exhibited for photons of @xmath78tev , the absorption is not detectable in sources cutting off at @xmath136tev .",
    "additionally , the spectral softening due to absorption by the ebl makes it more difficult to detect the influence of the host galaxy .",
    "we derived the maximum degree of absorption for a sample of host galaxies of tev detected blazars . in most galaxies",
    "the degree of absorption is on the order of @xmath124 or less .",
    "we do not find significant correlations between absorption and characteristic parameters of the hosts , such as the emissivity , the size of the galaxy or the half - light radius of the brightness profile .",
    "this implies that these parameters are not independent from each other , pointing to fundamental relations for galaxy evolution .",
    "we also find no correlation between the degree of absorption and the redshift of the source , which excludes a strong selection bias in our sample .",
    "an uncertainty in our results is the starlight profile . for most galaxies",
    "only the parameters of the de vaucouleurs profile are known .",
    "however , its predictive power of the central region of galaxies is limited , and more sophisticated profiles would be useful .",
    "the lack of these prevents a study on the influence of the profile on the absorption , and the explanatory power of averaged profiles that do not represent well individual galaxies , is at least questionable .",
    "the uncertainties of the ebl inhibit the detection of the starlight absorption for any source beyond a redshift of @xmath137 .",
    "nevertheless , a differential comparison of sources with similar redshift and similar intrinsic properties , but different hosts , could be used to detect the starlight absorption .",
    "the impact of starlight absorption on the tev spectrum of the agn is up to @xmath3 , and this study has shown that the absorption by starlight in nearby tev sources should be taken into account to construct the de - absorbed spectrum , which is used to derive the physical properties of the tev emission region .",
