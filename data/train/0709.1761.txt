    "observations of distant galaxies provide a direct view of the early stages of galaxy evolution as well as probing the physical conditions of the high - redshift intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the advent of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) deployed on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) in addition to wide field optical cameras operated on 8 m class telescopes has provided access to relatively large samples of galaxies located at @xmath6 and beyond .",
    "observations of distant lyman drop - out galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and emitting galaxies selected via narrow - band photometry ( @xcite ; @xcite ) indicate that these bright , distant galaxies can not be the sole agents of the global re - ionisation demonstrated by studies of gunn - peterson absorption in high - redshift quasars @xcite .",
    "current solutions to this dilemma centre upon the potential contribution of faint galaxies at @xmath7 pointed to in the very deepest , yet numerically smallest , acs samples   or the possibility that an earlier epoch of more intense star formation was responsible for the observed re - ionisation .",
    "perhaps the most important contribution to the debate concerning the physical nature of bright , high - redshift galaxies has come from spitzer space telescope observations of rest - frame optical emission in these systems ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "optical to near infrared ( nir ) observations of @xmath6 galaxies sample rest - frame emission blueward of the 4000  discontinuity and are thus sensitive primarily to the spectral contribution from younger stellar populations .",
    "the addition of spitzer / irac bands , particularly at 3.6  and 4.5 , samples the potential contribution of older stellar populations in these galaxies . from the limited number of bright @xmath6 galaxies studied to date",
    ", there has emerged a picture of their stellar populations as being relatively old ( up to 700  myr ) and massive ( up to @xmath8 ) .",
    "the extrapolation of these integrated star formation histories to earlier cosmic times points to an epoch of potentially intense star formation in the predecessors of bright @xmath9 galaxies extending to redshifts @xmath10 .",
    "though compelling evidence points to the existence of actively star forming galaxies at @xmath5 , the direct observation of such sources is far from straightforward   mainly due to the extreme faintness of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the brightest galaxies observed at @xmath7 display total ab magnitudes of order 24 ( e.g. @xcite ; hu et al .",
    "2004 ) . galaxies at @xmath5   including current samples of candidate systems   can be reasonably expected to display signal levels @xmath11 in nir wavebands @xcite . obtaining a spectroscopic redshift for such faint",
    ", continuum selected systems with currently available technology is challenging ( though not impossible , c.f .",
    "studies employing narrow - band filters or long - slit spectral observations are sensitive to the subset of high - redshift galaxies that emit a significant fraction of their energy in the form of narrow spectral lines   typically the emission line . deep narrow - band imaging and subsequent spectroscopic observations have been employed successfully to generate high spectral completeness samples of distant galaxies at redshifts @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "long - slit spectral observations of massive lensing clusters have been employed to investigate the faint end of the emission luminosity function over the interval @xmath14 @xcite in addition to generating samples of candidate systems in the interval @xmath15 @xcite . in comparison to narrow - band observations ,",
    "long slit spectroscopic observations of emitting sources typically probe a lower background per resolution element yet are normally restricted to relatively small volume studies due to the limited field of view of a spectrograph slit .    a critical unknown factor determining the visibility of the emission feature in @xmath5 galaxies is the physical state of the intervening igm .",
    "absorption studies of @xmath7 quasars appear to have identified the very end of the global re - ionisation process @xcite while measurement of the optical depth of electron scattering at large angular scales in the cmb points to a typical ( though not definitive ) epoch of reionisation around @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "clearly then , galaxies at redshifts @xmath17 may be located in a partly ionised igm where the local fraction of neutral hydrogen around individual galaxies may be sufficient to attenuate the emission signature .",
    "however , individual emitting galaxies have been identified in deep , narrow @xmath18-band surveys and confirmed spectroscopically at redshifts @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "prompted by such observations , numerous theoretical studies have been undertaken to compute the escape fraction of ultra - violet ( uv ) photons from a volume of high - redshift intergalactic hydrogen ionised as a result of star formation occuring in an embedded galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , while the detailed properties of the line transmitted through such a medium are necessarily model dependent , e.g. depending upon the mass , metallicity , star formation rate and initial mass function of the burst and the local density of the igm , a range of plausible scenarios exist whereby a hii region of sufficient size is created such that transmission of a partially attenuated line occurs .",
    "the above considerations serve as the motivation for a nir search for emitting galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "the search technique employs a narrow @xmath0band filter centred on 1.187  and is sensitive to the signature of emitting galaxies located at a redshift @xmath21 ( termed in the following text ) .",
    "the remaining sections are organised as follows : in section [ sec_zen ] we describe in further detail the construction of the narrow - band survey . in section [ sec_data ]",
    "we describe the techniques used to process the data and identify candidate emitting galaxies .",
    "finally in section [ sec_res ] we determine the co - moving volume at sampled in terms of the emission luminosity and compare this to a reasonable range of expected properties of galaxies . throughout this paper , values of @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are adopted for the present epoch cosmological parameters describing the evolution of a model friedmann - robertson - walker universe .",
    "all magnitude information is quoted using ab zero point values .",
    "the desirability of detecting very high redshift emitting galaxies forms the motivation for the `` @xmath18 equals nine '' ( zen ) survey . emitting galaxies occupying narrow redshift intervals at @xmath5 will present a characteristic emission excess signature in infrared photometry employing a combination of narrow and broad band filters .",
    "narrow - band , nir filters tuned to sample regions of night sky emission devoid of strong terrestrial line features provide access to relatively low background signals and thus permit sensitive imaging observations to be executed . in what we refer to as zen1 we constructed a 32 hour on - sky image of the hubble deep field south ( hdf - s ) in the narrow - band filter nb119 employing the vlt / isaac facility ( @xcite ; wc05 hereafter ) .",
    "using deep , archival images of the field consisting of vlt / isaac @xmath25-band and hst / wfpc2 optical bands we were able to execute a sensitive test for faint narrow - band excess sources ( i.e. @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) that remain undetected in optical bands   a practical definition for candidate emitters .",
    "no candidate zen sources were identified in these observations . however , the study demonstrated that interloping low redshift emission excess sources could be successfully identified and rejected using deep optical images and that a detailed volume selection function could be computed in terms of emission luminosity .",
    "as part of a new study   dubbed zen2 ",
    "we have obtained further narrow and broad band images directed toward the fields of three low redshift galaxy clusters : a1689 , a1835 and ac114 ( table [ tab_fields ] ) .",
    "each cluster acts as a gravitational lens and provides a spatially magnified view of the background universe . when considering unresolved sources the effect of this magnification is to increase the total brightness measured within a photometric detection aperture .",
    "we therefore use the presence of each cluster along the line of sight to provide a gravitational `` boost '' to the signal from putative galaxies .",
    "the properties of each cluster have been described in detail in the literature and each possesses a well - determined gravitational lens model .",
    "lens models describing the clusters a1689 , a1835 and ac114 are presented respectively in limousin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , smith et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and campusano et al .",
    "infrared observations of the three clusters were obtained with the vlt / isaac facility as part of eso programmes 070.a-0643 , 071.a-0428 , 073.a-0475 and are summarised in table [ tab_fields ] .",
    "optical observations of the three clusters consist of hst / acs f850lp mosaics .",
    "these are described briefly in table [ tab_hst ] and in further detail in @xcite for a1689 and @xcite for a1835 and ac114 .",
    "the nir observations described in this paper all fall completely within the acs mosaic areas .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath0-band observations were obtained under photometric conditions and were placed on an absolute flux scale using observations of standard stars taken with the science data .",
    "reference magnitudes for standard stars observed with the nb119 filter are not available .",
    "the nb119 data were therefore placed on an absolute flux scale by comparing the flux measured within a 5  diameter circular aperture for a sample of bright , isolated stellar sources visible in both the @xmath0-band and nb119 images of each field .",
    "the colour term @xmath28 for these reference sources is approximately zero and the relationship between @xmath0-band reference magnitudes and nb119 instrumental magnitudes is linear and displays a gradient of unity .",
    "a total of 12 , 16 and 16 such reference sources were employed for the fields a1689 , a1835 and ac114 respectively .",
    "source detection and photometry were performed on each image using the sextractor software package ( bertin and arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "once again , we continue the approach outlined in wc05 , i.e. source detection is optimised for the detection of marginally resolved or unresolved objects and source fluxes are measured in circular apertures of diameter 07 . the required correction to convert aperture photometry to pseudo - total photometry ( assumed to be a 5  diameter circular aperture )",
    "was computed for bright stellar sources in each field .",
    "corrections generated for each image are given in table [ tab_iq ] , though it should be noted that subsequent calculations based upon image photometry all use the 07 aperture values .",
    "the magnitude corresponding to the 90% point source recovery threshold in each image ( @xmath29 ) was computed by introducing artificial point sources into the reduced image of each field and determining the fraction recovered ( see wc05 ) .",
    "this procedure produces a low resolution ( 3  pixels ) image of the varying depth of each image .",
    "in addition , this process generates a map of photometric uncertainty across each field taking into account contamination by bright galaxies . the average value of the completeness across each image is also displayed in figure [ fig_complete3 ] as a function of source magnitude .",
    "the magnitudes corresponding to the 90%completeness limit in each field and filter combination are displayed in table [ tab_iq ] .",
    "the typical signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of a source displaying @xmath29 in each field is approximately 15 .",
    "note that for the purposes of computing the survey selection function in section [ sec_res ] we employ the two dimensional completeness information available for each field .",

    "the horizontal dotted line indicates the 90%  completeness threshold.,width=245 ]    candidate emitting galaxies are identified as narrow - band excess sources relative to the @xmath0-band reference filter .",
    "figure [ fig_cmd3 ] displays the narrow - band excess versus nb119 magnitude for each of the target fields .",
    "we identify emission line sources as those displaying a positive @xmath28 signature in excess of the local @xmath30 uncertainty in @xmath28 . at the 90%  completeness limit of each field",
    "this corresponds to a colour excess @xmath31 . of the sources satisfying this narrow - band excess threshold , all",
    "are ultimately detected in hst f850lp images of each field .",
    "we therefore associate these sources with intervening emission line galaxies ( e.g. [ oii]3727 , h@xmath32 or h@xmath33 ) located at redshifts that place the emission feature in the nb119 filter ( c.f .",
    "the field of view of the nir images of each cluster cover an area of 4 square arcminutes in each case . within this area the images of clusters a1689 , a1835 and ac114 respectively contain 4 , 13 and 21 interloping emission line sources down to the observed frame magnitude limit @xmath29 appropriate for each field .",
    "in addition , a small number of sources in each field are detected in the narrow - band but remain undetected in the accompanying @xmath0-band .",
    "all of these sources were investigated and ultimately associated with faint sources in optical hst observations .",
    "therefore , no candidate emitting galaxies have been detected in any of the three fields studied .",
    "the non - detection of candidate emitting galaxies in the three cluster fields may be understood by computing the total volume sampled at each luminosity . to achieve this the survey flux sensitivity as a function of solid angle",
    "must be corrected for the magnification introduced by the cluster lensing potential in each field , distance dimming and the effect of partial transmission of the line by the nb119 filter .",
    "the gravitational potential associated with each galaxy cluster creates a magnified view of the background universe .",
    "this magnification can be considered as a spatially varying transformation between the source plane and image plane geometry of a particular field .",
    "the detection limits displayed in figure [ fig_complete3 ] are associated with the image plane of each cluster .",
    "the corresponding source plane detection map for each cluster was computed using the lenstool package @xcite and a model potential describing each cluster .",
    "each pixel in the detection map ( location and area ) was transformed to the source plane accounting for the varying lens deflection angle as a function of sky position before being reassembled onto a uniform pixel grid .",
    "images displaying the individual stages in this procedure are displayed in figure [ fig_3x3 ] .        in appendix",
    "a of wc05 we described how the magnitude limit of a particular narrow - band image could be transformed into a emission line luminosity at by accounting for the equivalent width criterion applied to select narrow - band excess sources and the partial transmission of the line by the narrow - band filter . the mean flux sensitivity toward each cluster field is given in table [ tab_iq ] and is computed over both image plane and source plane ( i.e. de - lensed ) pixels .",
    "the volume sampled as a function of luminosity , @xmath34 , is then computed as the integral over the differential co - moving volume element out to the maximum redshift at which a source displaying the specified luminosity would be detected .",
    "we apply the same procedure to determine @xmath35 in the current study with only a minor modification : rather than compute the volume sampling based upon the average depth over each field , we compute the volume sampled per pixel in the source plane detection map describing each cluster .",
    "the volume sampled as a function of luminosity for each cluster field is then computed as the contribution from individual detection map pixels , weighted by the solid angle of each pixel . the volume selection function for each cluster is displayed in figure [ fig_vsamp ] .",
    "each curve is computed assuming a emission line of rest frame velocity width @xmath36 ( see wc05 for additional details ) .",
    "the inverse of the volume selection function for the zen survey is equal to the cumulative space density of emitting galaxies sampled as a function of their emission luminosity ( figure [ fig_lfcomp ] ) .",
    "the region above each curve in figure [ fig_lfcomp ] indicates the region of the cumulative luminosity function of putative emitting galaxies that can be ruled out as a result of the non - detection of bona - fide sources it is instructive to compare these limits to the cumulative luminosity function both of observed emitting galaxies at redshift @xmath37 ( kashikawa et al .",
    "2006 ) and to emitting galaxies simulated within a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation ( le delliou et al 2006 ) .",
    "we consider the implications for each population in turn .",
    "if we use the observed population of emitting galaxies at @xmath37 as a model for emission at then the current areal coverage of the zen survey would have to be increased by a factor of at least three in order to provide a realistic constraint on the putative population . the prospect for extending deep , narrow - band surveys at to wider areal coverage",
    "is promising given the advent of both the dazle @xcite and hawk - i @xcite nir cameras at the eso vlt .",
    "if instead the properties of emitting galaxies at are described by the semi - analytic model of le delliou et al .",
    "then the prospects for their detection is less certain .",
    "a small region of the model described by a uv photon escape fraction of 0.2 has already been tentatively ruled out by the zen survey .",
    "however , reducing the escape fraction to 0.02 results in a proportionate decrease in the luminosity and the detection of such a population with either dazle or hawk - i will remain challenging .",
    "an interesting alternative approach employs the current generation of relatively wide field nir cameras operating on 4 m class telescopes . in figure [ fig_lfcomp ]",
    "we display the anticipated results of zen3 , a narrow - band search for emitting galaxies at @xmath38 currently underway using the canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) wircam facility @xcite .",
    "the exceptional volume sampling of such wide field cameras will permit a very sensitive test of the space density of putative @xmath38 emitters , whether based upon observed @xmath37 or model populations .",
