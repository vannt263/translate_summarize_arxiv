    "using the wide angle search for planets ( wasp , pollacco et al .",
    "2006 ) photometric database , @xcite recently discovered 17 bright eclipsing binaries which contain an a- or f - type dwarf ( main sequence , ms ) star and a helium white - dwarf precursor ( proto - he wd hereinafter ) , i.e. being in a rarely - observed state evolving to higher effective temperatures at a nearly constant luminosity prior to being a very low - mass wd . among these stars ,",
    "el cvn is the brightest and is the only one previously identified as a variable star , so has been adopted as the prototype of this class of eclipsing binary star . in this paper , we define a binary as an el cvn - type binary if it has an a- or f - type dwarf star ( with mass of @xmath8 ) and a proto - he wd being in the constant-@xmath9 phase .",
    "multi - periodic pulsations were first discovered in the proto - he wd companion of 1swasp j024743.37 - 251549.2 ( j0247 - 25 hereinafter ) where the proto - he wd has a mass of @xmath0 @xcite , then in 1swasp j162842.31 + 101416.7 ( wasp 1628 + 10 ) where the mass of the proto - he wd companion is only about @xmath10@xcite .",
    "this provides an opportunity to study the structure and formation of such low - mass wds in details through the application of asteroseismology to this new class of pulsating variable stars .    objects similar to the proto - he wd companions of el cvn - type binaries , i.e. low - mass , thermally bloated hot wds have been discovered in the kepler field .",
    "they are koi 74 , koi 81@xcite , khwd3 ( koi 1375 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , koi 1224 @xcite , kic 9164561 and kic 10727668 @xcite .",
    "some of them are obviously the descendants of el cvn- type stars  they have just departed from the constant-@xmath9 phase and some may be in the stage of surface h flash . moreover , the rr lyr star ogle - blg - rrlyr-02792 was found to be an eclipsing binary system where the pulsator is a proto - he wd with a mass of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "el cvn - type stars are then probably common in universe and it is necessary to study their formation in details and estimate their number in the galaxy .",
    "extremely low - mass wd ( elm , with masses below @xmath12 , descendants of proto - he wds ) have also been found in some millisecond pulsars ( msps , see a summary in table 1 of @xcite ) and in double degenerate systems ( dds , see the latest paper of the elm survey of @xcite ) . in general ,",
    "low - mass he wds ( @xmath13 ) can be produced by binary evolution through stable mass transfer or rapid common - envelope evolution ( cee ) .",
    "the cee is unlikely to produce the low - mass he wds in msps since the neutron star should be spun up through stable mass accretion .",
    "our simple analysis for the 17 el cvn samples ( see appendix ) show that el cvn - type stars are also unlikely to be produced from the cee , in which the donor ( the progenitor of the proto - he wd ) should be at or very close to the base of red giant branch ( rgb ) ( due to the very low mass of the proto - he wds , @xmath0 ) , where the envelope is tightly bound and the ejection of the ce results in a system with a much shorter orbital period e.g. some dds in the elm survey , than those of el cvn stars . we are therefore only concerned here with the stable mass transfer channel for the formation of el cvn - type stars .",
    "before we go into the details of stable mass transfer channel , we firstly introduce the bifurcation period , @xmath14 , in low mass binary evolution , which is crucial for the formation of el cvn - type stars .",
    "1 presents a group of evolutionary tracks of the donors for binaries with component masses of 1.0 and @xmath15 but various initial orbital periods , @xmath16 .",
    "we can see two evolutionary regimes based on the value of @xmath17 .",
    "the donor evolves to ever decreasing luminosity for short @xmath16 while it passes through a nearly constant-@xmath9 phase and leaves a degenerate remnant eventually when @xmath16 is longer than the critical value @xmath14 .",
    "this is known as the bifurcation period ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "binaries below the bifurcation period ( @xmath18 ) typically evolve to a minimum orbital period ( on the order of 1 hr ) and then back to slightly increasing orbital periods . for binaries with @xmath19",
    ", there is a fairly tight @xmath1 relation , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the remnant mass of the donor and the final orbital period , respectively .",
    "the @xmath1 relation has been observed in several types of close binary stars such as binary radio pulsars @xcite , hot subdwarfs @xcite and a number of kepler binaries containing low - mass hot wds @xcite .",
    "the predicted value of @xmath14 depends on the initial parameters of each binary and the assumptions in the modelling of the binary evolution process .",
    ", @xmath22 ) but various initial orbital periods ( @xmath16 ) , as denoted in the figure .",
    "it clearly shows the bifurcation period in binary evolution : for initial orbital period @xmath16 less than the bifurcation period @xmath14 ( @xmath23 d in this case ) the mass donor evolves directly to very low luminosity , and for @xmath16 slightly greater than @xmath14 the evolution can produce a long - lived phase of evolution at nearly constant luminosity ( proto - he wd phase ) .",
    "[ bifu],width=226 ]    the very low mass of the proto - he wds and the short orbital periods mean that only binaries with initial orbital periods slightly longer than @xmath14 can produce el cvn - type stars .",
    "for example , the reconstructions of the evolutionary history for wasp j0247 - 25 and wasp 1628 + 10 @xcite showed that both the objects are probably from stable mass transfer where the mass donor starts to lose mass before it leaves the ms , i.e. the central h abundance is larger than zero .",
    "the parameter space for producing el cvn - type stars in this way is then expected to be small since both @xmath20 and @xmath21 increase significantly with @xmath16 .",
    "the expectation is against the fact that many such objects have been discovered .",
    "the timescale for the nearly constant-@xmath9 phase , @xmath24 , may play a role here .",
    "some particular examples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that the value of @xmath24 can be up to nearly @xmath25 yrs when the proto - he wd mass is lower than about @xmath26 . the majority of the products in @xcite have he wds larger than @xmath27 , more massive than those in el cvn - type stars .",
    "@xcite studied the formation of the low - mass he wd in msps through stable mass transfer near the bifurcation period and obtained a very strong dependence of the proto - he wd lifetime on its mass , approximately as the reciprocal of wd mass to the 7th power . and very recently",
    ", they @xcite give the detailed models of the low - mass he wd produced in low - mass x - ray binaries including some microphysics such as gravitational settling , thermal and chemical diffusion , and rotational mixing . in principle , the proto - he wds in el cvn - type binaries have similar properties to those in msps .",
    "however , a complete binary evolution study and a binary population synthesis are still necessary for our comprehensive understanding of the formation and characteristics of el cvn - type stars , e.g which binary systems can produce el cvn - type stars , whether the number of such binaries from the stable mass transfer channel is sufficient to explain the observations , whether the binary properties are consistent with observations , what are the minimum mass and the peak mass , etc .",
    "we carried out more than 65,000 runs of binary evolution for population",
    "i ( pop i ) low - mass binaries for this comprehensive study .",
    "the details for the computation are introduced in section 2 , and the evolutionary consequences are summarized in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we show the number and parameter distributions of el cvn - type stars from our binary population synthesis . in section 5 ,",
    "we give some discussions , and the conclusions are shown in section 6 .",
    "we carried out binary evolution calculations with a newly - developed henyey code called mesa ( modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the advantages of mesa for our calculations are the inclusion of equations of state that are able to handle the low mass and high degree of degeneracy that the donors achieve , and the powerful capabilities of handling the huge fluctuations during the evolution such as h or he flashes .",
    "we used mesa version 3635 , in which the mass transfer scheme is similar to that of the ritter scheme in the latest version of mesa @xcite , that is , if we denote the density by @xmath28,the isothermal sound speed by @xmath29 , and the effective cross section of the flow by @xmath30 ( all taken at @xmath31 ) , the mass transfer rate is given by @xcite    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the radii of the donor and its roche lobe , respectively , and @xmath35 is the pressure scale height of the atmosphere divided by a factor related to the mass ratio , as described in @xcite .",
    "this expression allows mass transfer to take place through the inner lagrangian point @xmath31 even when @xmath36 , which is reasonable since stars generally have extended atmospheres . ' , an eddington approximation estimated for optical depth equal to 2/3 .",
    "the choice of this bounary condtion almost has no effect on our results in this paper since we are only concerned on the temperature but not the spectral energy distribution . ]",
    "the mass transfer is assumed to be non - conservative , with 50 per cent of the material lost from the donor being accreted by the companion while the other 50 per cent leaves the system with the same specific angular momentum as pertains to the donor .",
    "the treatment of non - conservative mass transfer , in particular the amount of specific angular momentum that is lost from the system is a major uncertainty in modeling binary evolution and different reasonable prescriptions can give very different evolutionary paths @xcite .",
    "varying the assumptions on the amount of mass and angular momentum loss will affect the value of the bifurcation period , resulting in a change in the parameter space available for the production of el cvn - type stars , but has little effect on the properties such as the lifetime of the proto - he wds and the proto - hewd mass - orbital period relation etc .",
    "we will give a discussion on this in sects .",
    "3 and 4 .",
    "we have not followed the evolution of the companions since it is very time consuming . for convenience",
    ", we simply assume that the companion stars are in thermal equilibrium and obtain their parameters such as radius @xmath37 , luminosity @xmath9 from the classical relations for main sequence stars , depending on their masses @xmath38 , that is @xcite ,    @xmath39    @xmath40    the behavior of the accreting companion is complicated , e.g. it will lose thermal equilibrium when the mass accreting rate is larger than a certain value ( depending on the mass of the accretor ) and expand @xcite , and may overfill its roche lobe , leading to the formation of a contact binary and the subsequent termination of the formation process of el cvn stars @xcite .",
    "we stop the calculations when the accretor overfills its roche lobe even being in thermal equilibrium ( i.e. the radius is obtained from eq(2 ) ) or the luminosity of the donor drops below @xmath41 ( the system evolves below the bifurcation period and the donor can not contract to be a he wd ) and discard the models if the mass transfer rate @xmath42 is larger than @xmath43 since ( 1 ) @xmath42 will be up to 1@xmath44/yr soon after @xmath45 in most binaries that we checked ( see section 3.1 ) , leading to dynamically unstable mass transfer , and ( 2 ) the accretor will expand rapidly within such a high accretion rate and overfill its roche lobe very likely ( the binary can not evolve to an el cvn binary in both cases ) .",
    "the main sequence lifetime of the companion ( from the zero - age main sequence to the termination of main sequence ) , @xmath46 , is obtained from the fitting formula in hurley s paper @xcite . since the companion has evolved for a while before mass accretion",
    ", the companion star is not exactly at the zero - age main sequence and the @xmath46 here is in fact an upper limit .",
    "but we checked that it has little effect on the final result .",
    "we reduced the main sequence lifetime of the companion to be 0.5@xmath46 and obtained a very similar result as shown in section 3 .",
    "gravitational wave radiation ( gwr ) is accounted for using the following equation ( landau & lifshitz , 1971 ) :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 , @xmath49 are component masses of the binary , @xmath50 is the semi - major axis of the ( circular ) orbit , @xmath51 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath52 is the gravitational constant . to account for magnetic braking ( mb ) we use equation ( 36 ) from rappaport et al .",
    "( 1983 ) with @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 where @xmath48 and @xmath33 are the mass and radius of the donor and @xmath55 is its rotational angular velocity which is assumed to be equal to the orbital angular velocity of the system due to tidal synchronization .",
    "we switch off the mb when the surface convective region is too small , i.e. less than 1 per cent of the total mass .",
    "our study is focused on pop i low - mass binaries ( with a metallicity @xmath56 ) and the initial parameters of our models are summarized as follows :    the donor mass ( @xmath57 in @xmath44 ) : 0.90 , 0.95 , 1.0 , 1.05 , 1.10 , ... , 2.0 ( with @xmath58 )    initial mass ratio ( @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the initial mass of the secondary ) : 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , ... , 4.0 ( with @xmath61 )    initial orbital period ( @xmath16 in days , by step of @xmath62 ) : from 2.5 to 4.5 for @xmath63 and 0.5 to 2.5 for @xmath64 .",
    "various values of @xmath16 for different donor masses and such a small interval in @xmath16 are chosen so that we obtain a relatively accurate value of @xmath14 and a dense grid around @xmath14 for each set of ( @xmath57 , @xmath65 ) .",

    "the remnant has a larger final mass ( @xmath74 ) and suffers several h shell flashes after the nearly constant-@xmath9 phase but before the cooling .",
    "the h shell flashes cause the luminosity of the remnant to increase by several orders of magnitude on a dynamical timescale .",
    "the remnant is then highly bloated during the flashes and has characteristics very different from that in the constant-@xmath9 phase . in this paper , we only focus on the nearly constant-@xmath9 phase before h flashes , and define the end of the nearly constant-@xmath9 phase to be the point of maximum @xmath75 before h flashes or the he wd cooling if no flash occurs .",
    "the evolution paths predicted by our calculations are summarized in figs .",
    "according to observations , el cvn - type binaries are defined as the binaries consisting of a proto - he wd and an a- or f- type dwarf companions , i.e an ms star with its mass in the range of @xmath8 . in each panel of the figures , the lower boundary is determined by the bifurcation period , while the upper and right boundaries are determined by the limit of maximum mass tranfer rate ( @xmath76 ) . from the figures we see that when @xmath77 only binaries in which the donor starts mass transfer after the end of ms can leave degenerate remnants and so contribute to the production of el cvn - type stars . for more massive donors",
    "el cvn - type stars can be produced when the donor starts mass transfer on the ms if @xmath65 is not very large .",
    "the most likely mass for producing short orbital period el cvn - type stars ( i.e. @xmath5 d ) is in the range of @xmath2 . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the parameter space decreases with the mass increasing and few models can produce el cvn - type binaries with @xmath79 d when @xmath80 .",
    "we see also small parameter spaces for @xmath81 .",
    "we explain this as follows .",
    "it is the mb that determines the parameter space for producing el cvn stars .",
    "the discontinuous change between @xmath82 and @xmath83 is due to the fact that mb works when the donor is on the ms for @xmath81 but does not for @xmath84 .",
    "when @xmath81 , many binaries that would evolve beyond the bifurcation period ( then producing proto - he wds ) now evolve below the bifurcation period since the mb leads the mass transfer starting in advance .",
    "these binaries then can not produce el cvn stars any more , resulting in the small parameter space in low - mass range . for binaries with @xmath84 ,",
    "the convection envelope develops in the late phase of hertzsprung gap ( hg ) and the mb plays a crucial role in that phase , i.e. many of the progenitors of the proto - he wds , which would start mass transfer on rgb if mb were not included , start mass transfer in advance , resulting in stable mass transfer and low - mass he wds are more likely . with the increasing of the donor mass , the mass transfer rate becomes larger and larger in hg and may be up to @xmath76 before the donor develops the surface convection region , and the mb does not affect the result any more .",
    "this occurs when @xmath85 . to trace the effect of mb on parameter space",
    ", we show the boundaries at which the donor overfills its roche lobe at the termination of the ms ( tms ) and at the base of rgb ( brgb ) when the mb has been included ( the thin solid lines ) and when the mb has not been included ( the dotted lines ) in figs .",
    "we see that the tms lines in the two cases are similar when @xmath86 and the brgb lines are similar when @xmath87 , clearly showing the parameter space affected by the mb , as we described above .",
    "note that , even when the mb does not play a role with mass increasing gradually , the tms ( brgb ) lines in our models are not exactly overlapped with that of no mb effect included since we adopted eq(1 ) to calculate the mass transfer rate ; that is , the mass transfer starts before the donor overfills its roche lobe .",
    "as mentioned before , we have not included the models with mass transfer rates exceeding @xmath76 in figs .",
    "however it is very valuable for binary evolution to trace the following behaviours of the donor when the mass transfer rate is larger than @xmath76 .",
    "we then set the maximum allowed mass transfer rate to be 1@xmath88 in our calculation and recalculate the models of @xmath89 . in our original parameter space , the mass transfer rates for binaries with this donor mass are always smaller than @xmath76 when the initial mass ratio @xmath90 .",
    "we therefore only examined the models with @xmath91 .",
    "we found that , in a few models , the mass transfer rate may exceed @xmath76 but does not increase up to @xmath92 .",
    "however , in most binaries we studied , the mass transfer rate will increase up to 1@xmath88 soon after @xmath76 is reached .",
    "the timescale of this process ( from @xmath76 to @xmath93 ) is a few years to @xmath94 yrs , and the amount of mass transferred during this process is less than @xmath95 .",
    "for example , if @xmath96 , the mass transfer rate is always less than @xmath76 when @xmath97 d , and it exceeds @xmath76 for a while but never reaches @xmath92 when @xmath98 and 1.80 d. when @xmath99 d , the mass transfer rate increases up to 1@xmath88 soon after @xmath76 is reached , with a timescale less than 300 yr and the amount of mass transferred less than @xmath95 . the dashed line in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "4 shows the boundary for @xmath92 , very close to that for @xmath76 .",
    "this indicates that the mass transfer rate of @xmath76 might be a good ( though not very strict ) criterion for dynamical instability .",
    "please note that the models with initial orbital periods in the gap between the boundary for @xmath76 and that for @xmath92 have no contribution to the formation of el cvn stars , though the mass transfer process is probably dynamically stable , since the companions will lose thermal equilibrium in such high mass accretion rates and expand to overfill their roche lobes .",
    "the systems then become contact and the formation process of el cvn stars is terminated ( see section 2 ) .      , for el cvn - type stars .",

    "similar to figs . 35",
    ", various colors denote different orbital period ranges . for models with donors having degenerate cores ( the upper panel ) ,",
    "we see a strong correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath24 , that is , @xmath103 for products with @xmath104 , and @xmath105 for the lower lifetime limit . as mentioned in section 1",
    ", @xcite obtained a similar strong dependence ( approximately as the reciprocal of wd mass to the 7th power ) between the lifetime of the proto - he wd and its mass according to their studies on msps .",
    "the strong correlation can be well explained as follows .",
    "after the termination of mass transfer , the h - burning shell still exists and supports the luminosity . the value of @xmath24 then can be simply estimated by @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the envelope mass of the proto - hewd , and @xmath108 is the nuclear reaction rate of h and depends on the temperature in the h - burning shell , @xmath109 . in general , @xmath109 increases with core mass , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 at the termination of mass transfer for donors with degenerate cores .",
    "a small @xmath20 therefore indicates a smaller @xmath110 , then a lower @xmath109 and a lower @xmath108 . on the other hand",
    ", there is an anti - correlation between @xmath107 and @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "8) , that is , a small @xmath20 has a larger @xmath107 at the end of mass transfer .",
    "both of these factors result in a longer lifetime for lower @xmath20 . in our calculation , @xmath112 yrs for @xmath113 , @xmath114 yrs for @xmath115 and up to @xmath116 yrs when @xmath117 .",
    "this explains why so many very low - mass proto - he wds have been discovered . for donors with @xmath118 ,",
    "the @xmath119 relation has a large scatter because the assumption of @xmath120 is invalid and the value of @xmath107 is scattered as well ( see the lower panel of fig . 8) .",
    ", at the end of mass transfer .",
    "the colors of red , green , blue and gray are for the final orbital period in the range of 0.51.0 d , 1.02.2 d , 2.210 d and @xmath100 d , respectively .",

    "[ mfme],title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    the anti - correlation between @xmath107 and @xmath20 for remnants from donors with degenerate cores comes from the competition between radiation pressure , @xmath123 , and gravity pressure , @xmath124 , near the end of mass transfer process .",
    "a large @xmath20 indicates a larger core mass @xmath110 , then a larger @xmath124 and a higher @xmath109 as mentioned above .",
    "so , more shell - burning energy is produced and needs to be transferred outwards , resulting in a higher @xmath123 as well .",
    "when @xmath107 is small enough , i.e. the shell - burning energy can be effectively transferred to the surface and radiate away , @xmath123 reduces dramatically and the giant suffers a sudden collapse and terminates the mass transfer process .",
    "the radiation pressure dominates the process and leads to the fact that a massive remnant has a smaller envelope mass",
    ". however , the products appear as two groups as shown in fig . 8 , and there is a small tail in the upper group , i.e. @xmath107 increases with @xmath20 as @xmath125 .",
    "this is related to the discontinuous composition gradient produced by the first dredge up in stars evolving on the rgb .",
    "the donor s h - burning shell does not cross the composition jump during the mass transfer process for the products on the upper group , but does for those in the lower group .",
    "the tail of the upper group is due to the fact that the contraction of the donor now is induced by the h - burning shell crossing the composition jump , rather than @xmath107 being less than a certain value .    for binaries with donors having non - degenerate cores ( the lower panel of fig .",
    "8) , the termination of mass transfer is a gradual process , i.e. the donor gradually draws back into its roche lobe .",
    "the envelope mass of the remnant therefore depends on the details of mass transfer process as well as the initial parameters of each binary , and results in a big scatter seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "8 . in general",
    ", for a given @xmath20 , a large initial mass ratio @xmath65 indicates a relatively larger roche lobe radius of the donor , then a larger radius and @xmath107 for the remnant at the end of mass transfer .",

    "in fact , if we assume no angular momentum being taken away by the lost mass , as for the last two cases here , the change of the orbital separation becomes small and the termination of mass transfer is more dependent on the structure of the donor than before , and the resulting binary may agree with the @xmath1 relation better .",

    "the study gives @xmath207 yrs for @xmath113 , @xmath208 yrs for @xmath115 and up to @xmath209 yrs when @xmath117 .",
    "this leads to an intrinsic peak mass around the minimum mass of proto - he wds ( @xmath3 ) , which is only determined by initial composition and does not depend on details of the mass transfer processes .",
    "the most common component masses of el cvn - type stars are @xmath167 and @xmath210 if selection effects are included , consistent with the observations .",
    "\\(3 ) the most likely progenitor mass for producing the observed el cvn - type stars ( with orbital period less than 2.2 d ) is in the range @xmath2 .",
    "assuming an appropriate star formation rate for the galaxy ( @xmath154 ) we find that , the birthrate of el cvn - type stars with shorter @xmath21 is very small and the local density is less than @xmath211 for @xmath179 d in populations younger than 2.5 gyr .",
    "however , the role of el cvn - type stars with short @xmath21 becomes more and more important with age due to the very long lifetime , and the number is @xmath212 for those with @xmath179 d in the galaxy , with a local density of @xmath185 .",
    "though the number or local density may change significantly with the assumptions in modeling binary evolution , many more low - mass el cvn - type stars are still expected and they are in old populations more likely , as can be confirmed observationally in future .",

    "here we make a simple analysis on the common envelope evolution ( cee ) channel for the formation of el cvn - type binaries . a reasonable and commonly used approximation for cee",
    "is based on energy conservation . as a companion star spirals in a giant s envelope , due to friction between the inner binary ( the giant s core and the companion ) and the envelope , the orbital energy is released and deposited in the envelope , and a part of the energy",
    "may be used to eject the envelope . if we denote the binding energy of the envelope as @xmath214 , the orbital energy released during the spiralling process as @xmath215 and the efficiency of energy conversion as @xmath216 , the envelope",
    "can only be ejected when @xmath217 .",
    "furthermore , denoting the core and envelope masses of the giant and its radius as @xmath110 , @xmath218 and @xmath219 , respectively , we have @xmath220 , where @xmath52 is the gravitation constant and @xmath221 is a dimensionless factor related to the actual giant structure . in general , the companion star can hardly accrete material in the ce process and we assume no mass to be accreted by the companion . with this assumption , we have @xmath222 \\ge \\frac{g(m_{\\rm c}+m_{\\rm e})m_{\\rm e}}{\\lambda r_{\\rm 1i}},\\ ] ] where @xmath223 is the mass of the companion and @xmath224 and @xmath225 are the orbital separation before and after the cee , respectively .",
    "the internal energy including ionization energy @xcite is also to be considered to play a role in the ejection of the envelope , but the contribution is very small when the giant is near the base of giant branch and is therefore ignored here .      defining the initial mass ratio as @xmath228 and the final mass ratio as @xmath229 , we have @xmath230 and according to kepler s third law , there is @xmath231 where @xmath232 and @xmath233 are orbital periods before and after the cee , respectively .",
    "the criterion for the ejection of the ce is immediately written as @xmath234(\\frac{r_{\\rm 1i}}{a_{\\rm i}})-1\\ge 0.\\ ] ] for convenience we denote the left part of eq ( a5 ) as @xmath235 . the criterion for ce ejection",
    "is then written as @xmath236 .",
    "note that there is an additional constraint on the initial mass ratio , i.e. @xmath237 , since the donor is the initially more massive component from binary evolution .    at the onset of cee",
    ", the giant just fills its roche lobe , i.e. @xmath238 , then we have @xmath239 where @xmath199 is the roche lobe radius of the giant ( see paczy@xmath213ski 1971 ) . combining eq ( a6 ) with kepler s third law and @xmath240",
    ", we have the initial orbital period @xcite @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the donor s mass .",
    "due to the well - known @xmath243 relation for giants , i.e. for pop i stars @xcite @xmath244 the value of @xmath232 can be approximately given by @xmath245 and @xmath110 .",
    "so we can obtain the value of @xmath235 from eqs ( a6 - 8 ) and the observed @xmath246 and @xmath233 , for given values of @xmath110 , @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "it is considered to be reasonable to suppose the value of @xmath249 to be in the range of @xmath250 @xcite . by setting @xmath251 , which is an extreme case and gives the maximum value of @xmath235",
    ", we examined a series values of @xmath110 and @xmath248 for all the 17 el cvn - type stars in table 2 of @xcite . for each el cvn - type sample ,",
    "the constraints of @xmath236 and @xmath237 require @xmath252 ( see fig .",
    "a1 for an example ) , far beyond the mass of proto - he wds in el cvn - type binaries .",
    "this means that the cee can not produce the observed el cvn - type stars .",

    "the common envelope can only be ejected when @xmath236 ( the horizonal line ) and the initial mass ratio should be greater than 1 ( the vertical line ) from binary evolution .",
