    "the rare - earth ( r)-based ternary compounds with the composition _ rtx _",
    ", where @xmath7 denotes a @xmath8-electron transition metal and @xmath9 is a @xmath2-element , have been studied extensively during last years@xcite .",
    "specifically , phases crystalizing in a cubic mgagas - type of crystal structure which are also known under the very unlucky name `` half - heusler '' phases , are well known because of many different intriguing and extraordinary physical properties observed in this family@xcite , including half - metallic@xcite and semiconducting - like behavior@xcite , giant magnetoresistivity@xcite or heavy fermion state.@xcite for this reason these phases have been named `` compounds with properties on request''@xcite . very recently , based on first - principle calculations , a topological insulating state has been predicted in heavy metal - element containing half - heusler phases@xcite .",
    "the topological insulator is a new state of quantum matter having a full insulating gap in the bulk , but with topologically protected gapless surface or edge states on the boundary .",
    "it has been demonstrated that some compounds from the series _ _",
    "r__aupb , _ _",
    "r__ptsb , _ _ r__ptbi or _ _ r__pdbi exhibit a band inversion similar to that discovered in hgte@xcite .",
    "band structure calculations show that these phases should possess a semimetallic or narrow - band semiconducting state and the topological state may be created by applying strain ( such as crystallographic distortion ) or by designing an appropriate quantum - well structure , similar to the case of hgte .",
    "interestingly , since many of those _ mgagas _ compounds contain a rare - earth element , additional properties ranging from superconductivity to magnetism and heavy fermion behavior may be realized within a topological matrix .",
    "these properties can open new research directions in realizing the quantized anomalous hall effect@xcite , topological superconductors with majorana fermion excitations@xcite and/or image magnetic monopole effect.@xcite in this paper we present the magnetic and electrical transport properties of a series of rare - earth - based _ _",
    "r__pdbi phases .",
    "the compounds are either paramagnetic or antiferromagnetic with nel temperatures of several kelvin ( except of ypdbi which shows diamagnetic behavior ) due to well localized 4__f _ _ electrons .",
    "the transport measurements revealed semimetallic behavior with likely dominance of @xmath2-type carriers .",
    "the electronic structure has complex character with the presence of multiple electron and hole bands .",
    "moreover , this family of compounds seems to possess very good thermoelectrical parameters , prospective for practical applications .",
    "polycrystalline samples of erpdbi , hopdbi , gdpdbi , ypdbi , dypdbi and nppdbi were prepared by arc - melting the constituents ( _ re _ : 99.9 % wt , pd : 99.999 % wt , sb : 99.999 % wt ) under ultra pure argon atmosphere . since additional heat treatment led to multiphase products , the as - cast samples were used for physical measurements .",
    "the quality of the obtained materials was checked at 300  k by powder x - ray diffraction ( huber guinier g670 image plate camera with cuk@xmath10 radiation , _ @xmath11 _",
    "= 1.5406  , and silicon as an internal standard , @xmath12 = 5.43119  ) , optical metallography ( zeiss axioplan 2 optical microscope with a ccd camera ) and edx analysis ( philips xl30 scanning electron microscope with integrated edxs system and s - utw - si-(li ) detector ) .",
    "all these studies have shown that the samples studied were single phase with a cubic structure of the mgagas - type ( space group @xmath133@xmath14 ) .",
    "this crystal structure is shown in fig .  1 , together with a unit cell adopted by so - called heusler phases ( mncu@xmath15al - type ; space group @xmath16 ) .",
    "the lattice parameters obtained from the x - ray diffraction data are : @xmath12  =  6.5952 , 6.6012 , 6.6343 , 6.6391 , 6.6906 and 6.7257   for erpdbi , hopdbi , dypdbi , ypdbi , gdpdbi and ndpdbi , respectively .",
    "the derived values are in a good agreement with those given in the literature@xcite .",
    "al - type phases.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    magnetization measurements were carried out in the temperature range 1.7 - 300  k and in magnetic fields up to 5  t using a quantum design mpms-5 magnetometer .",
    "the electrical resistivity was measured from 4 to 300  k by a standard four - point @xmath17 technique .",
    "the hall effect measurements were performed in the temperature range 1.5 - 300 k and in applied fields up to 12 t ( oxford instruments teslatron ) .",
    "the thermoelectric power was studied from 6 to 300  k , employing a home - built setup using pure copper as a reference material .",
    "the magnetic measurements revealed that hopdbi , dypdbi , gdpdbi and ndpdbi order antiferromagnetically at 2 , 3.5 , 13 and 4 k , respectively , while erpdbi remains paramagnetic down to the lowest temperature studied ( see fig .",
    "in wide temperature ranges the @xmath18 exhibit linear temperature dependence .",
    "they may be well described by the curie - weiss law and the effective magnetic moments @xmath19 being close to those expected for free @xmath0 ions within russell - saunders coupling scenario , @xmath20^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "this indicates good localization of the magnetic moments on the rare - earth atoms .",
    "moreover , the obtained values of the paramagnetic curie temperature are small and negative , consistent with the type of magnetic ordering in these systems . as the only exception , ypdbi , which does not contain @xmath21 electrons , shows a diamagnetic behavior ( see fig .",
    "2b ) that may reflect the formation of a time - reversal - invariant spin - orbit ground state .",
    "it is worth to recall that it is one of the conditions for realizing a @xmath22 = -1 topological insulating state.@xcite +        the temperature dependencies of the electrical resistivity of the _ _",
    "r__pdbi phases are shown in fig .",
    "3 . in general , the magnitude and the temperature variations of the resistivity are characteristic of semimetals or narrow - gap semiconductors@xcite . in the case of erpdbi , gdpdbi , ndpdbi and dypdbi ,",
    "the @xmath23 exhibits two different regimes . at high temperatures the electrical resistivity displays a semiconducting - like character ( @xmath24 ) , signaling carrier excitations over a small energy gap @xmath25 near the fermi level .",
    "this behavior is followed at lower temperatures by a metallic - like dependence of @xmath23 ( @xmath26 ) . in general , the observed behavior is reminiscent of those typical for doped semiconductors where , due to atomic disorder , defects and/or wrong stoichiometry some donor or acceptor levels are present , leading to metallic - like @xmath23 . in order to account for this rather complex temperature behavior a simple model of the electronic band structure in narrow gap semiconductors may be used ( see refs . ) .",
    "recently , this model has been successfully applied to describe the temperature dependence of the resistivity in some filled skutterudites@xcite as well as in compounds erpdsb @xcite , hopdsb @xcite and dypdbi @xcite . in this approach",
    "one considers two rectangular bands of height @xmath27 , separated by an energy gap @xmath25 , and the fermi level situated just below the gap . in order to describe the metallic conductivity at low temperatures ,",
    "the presence of some temperature - independent amount of carriers @xmath28 is assumed .",

    "as may be seen , the number of carriers @xmath28 as well as the parameters characterizing the bands and the gap ( @xmath27 and @xmath25 ) nicely reflect the differences between the compounds studied as regards the character and magnitude of their electrical conductivity .     to the experimental data ( see text ) .",

    "3a , the anomaly in @xmath23 can be suppressed by magnetic field , in a manner typical for superconductivity . however ,",
    "neither erpdbi nor erpdsb are bulk superconductors , as no corresponding features are observed in their magnetic and heat capacity data ( see ref .   for a more detailed discussion of this issue ) .",
    "thus , the origin of the unusual low - temperature behavior of the resistivity of erpdbi is unknown .",
    "similarly , at the present stage we can not reliably interpret the anomalous feature seen in @xmath23 of ypdbi , i.e. an increase of the resistivity below 19  k. +    ) to the experimental data ( see text ) .",

    "the overall magnitude and the temperature variations of the thermopower of _ _ r__pdbi are characteristic of low carrier density semimetals@xcite . at 300  k ,",
    "the thermoelectric power is as large as about 40 - 90  @xmath4v / k , which corresponds within a single band model to the effective carrier concentration of the order of 10@xmath41  @xmath42 .",
    "for all the compounds studied the seebeck coefficient is positive in the entire temperature range , thus suggesting that holes may dominate the electrical and heat transport .",
    "however , strongly curvilinear character of @xmath39 hints at the presence of complex electronic structure in the vicinity of the fermi energy .",
    "indeed , the most recent theoretical calculations have revealed a fairly complex electronic structure in ypdbi ( ref . ) and in other @xmath43 systems,@xcite with electron and hole bands close to the fermi energy .    to account for this complexity , the temperature dependencies of the thermoelectric power of the _",
    "_ r__pdbi compounds were analyzed in terms of a phenomenological model , which describes scattering of carriers on two quasiparticle bands laying close to the fermi level.@xcite in this approach , it is assumed that the conduction electrons are scattered independently on a narrow @xmath27 and a wide @xmath44 bands approximated by lorentzians .",
    "the thermoelectric power in such a system can be expressed by a modified mott s",
    "formula@xcite    @xmath45    where @xmath46    and @xmath47    in the above equations , @xmath48 represents the positions of the lorenzians with relation to the fermi energy , while @xmath49 stands for their width . as shown by the solid lines in fig .  4",
    "the above model provides a good description of the experimental data of _ _ r__pdbi .",

    "these values are much larger than the ones obtained for _ _",
    "r__pdsb compounds@xcite and comparable with @xmath5120 - 25  @xmath4w@xmath5k@xmath6 derived for the ( zr , hf)nisn system doped by ta or nd@xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that a large value of the power factor is the main prerequisite for good thermoelectrical efficiency , yet thermal conductivity studies are indispensable to fully characterize the thermoelectric potential of a given material .",
    "the performance of thermoelectric devices is quantified by a dimensionless figure of merit @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the seebeck coefficient , @xmath54 is the electrical resistivity , and @xmath55 stands for the thermal conductivity .",
    "such measurements would be needed especially for dypdbi which seems to be the most promising in terms of thermoelectric performance usefulness for applications .",

    "the positive sign of @xmath57 throughout the entire temperature range indicates that holes dominate the electrical and heat transport .",

    "these values were found to be strongly temperature dependent ( not shown ) . the value of @xmath63 , due to the crude approximation that neglects semimetallic character of the compound , can be considered as an upper limit of the real concentration in this material .",

    "_ m__nisn ( _ m _  =  hf , zr , ti)@xcite . in turn , the estimated mobility is much lower ( @xmath38  8 times ) than the bulk mobility obtained for the topological insulator bi@xmath15te@xmath68@xcite .",
    "it is also worth to mention that for the latter compound the surface mobility reaches as large magnitude as 10000  cm@xmath61v@xmath67s@xmath67 ( see ref . ) .",

    "all the samples studied showed the electrical conductivity reminiscent of semimetals or narrow gap semiconductors .",
    "their thermoelectric power behaves in a manner typical for semimetals with holes as majority carriers .",
    "moreover , for erpdbi , the hall effect study revealed a complex electronic structure with multiple electron and hole bands and different temperature and magnetic field variations of the carrier concentrations and their mobilities .",
    "the results obtained for the _ _ r__pdbi compounds seem to be fully compatible with the theoretical predictions for topological insulators.@xcite in particular , a non - trivial zero - gap semiconducting state has been postulated for ypdbi , with relatively small topological band inversion strength , whereas a narrow - gap semiconducting state has been predicted for ypdsb ( ref . ) .",
    "these theoretical results agree well with the experimental data , presented in this work and in ref . .",
    "it is worth noting that ypdbi ( maybe also some other _ _ r__pdbi compounds ) is located very close to the inversion transition@xcite , and hence it should be relatively easy to lift the degeneracy and open an inverted gap up at the fermi level by small distortion of the cubic structure via alloying or external pressure . this intriguing hypothesis should motivate further studies in the field . in the latter context , one should stress that even though the _ _",

    "even materials which display a bulk insulating state , in surface sensitive experiments such as stm or arpes , still show finite bulk carrier density in transport measurements@xcite .",
    "clearly , more investigations in this research field are required on well - defined samples with the highest quality , involving wide range of different experimental techniques .",
    "last but not least , all the _ _ r__pdbi compounds studied , and especially dypdbi , exhibit the large power factor coefficients @xmath3  =  6 - 20  @xmath4w@xmath5k@xmath6 .",
