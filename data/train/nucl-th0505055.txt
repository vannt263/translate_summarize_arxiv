    "the behavior of heavy quarkonium states as an experimental signature of medium modification in high energy heavy ion collisions originated with the prediction of @xmath0 suppression @xcite , which follows from screening of the color - confinement potential above the phase transition temperature .",
    "the suppression argument requires that the probability for recombination of the c and @xmath1 quark is negligible .",
    "recently it has been realized that for rhic and lhc collider energies , there can be a modification of the suppression argument @xcite .",
    "consider a central heavy ion collision in which multiple @xmath2 pairs are produced in binary nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "if these quarks are then immersed in a medium ( such as a quark - gluon plasma ) in which a charm quark from one initial @xmath2 pair can readily interact with an anticharm quark from a different initial @xmath2 pair , one expects that the number of @xmath0 formed from such interactions will be proportional to the total number of @xmath2 combinations .",
    "the relative efficiency of this quadratic process must be normalized by the number of interactions involving charm plus light - flavor quarks in which open - charm hadrons are formed .",
    "the normalization measure is generally taken @xcite to be proportional to the total number of charged hadrons produced in the heavy ion collision , @xmath3 , which leads to @xmath4 ( of course this behavior must saturate before @xmath5 becomes comparable in magnitude to @xmath6 . ) then at sufficiently large @xmath6 this quadratic behavior must dominate over the color - screening suppression",

    "measurements at rhic of high transverse momentum leptons in au - au collisions by phenix @xcite imply that @xmath8 20 , and measurement of reconstructed d mesons in d - au collisions by star @xcite require @xmath7 40 .",
    "statistical and systematic uncertainties are large enough such that these two measurements are consistent , but the general trend indicates a more rapid growth with energy than initially estimated @xcite .",
    "two distinct realizations of this mechanism for heavy quarkonium formation have been developed . in the statistical hadronization model ,",
    "quarks are distributed into hadrons during the hadronization transition according to chemical equilibrium ratios .",
    "the total number of heavy quarks is assumed to be determined by initial production , and an extra fugacity factor @xmath9 is determined by overall flavor conservation . in the case of hidden flavor such as @xmath0 , two powers of @xmath10 modify the thermal equilibrium density , which leads to the expected quadratic dependence on @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "there is no explicit prediction for the @xmath0 momentum spectrum , but it is natural to assume a thermal distribution in this model at the deconfinement temperature @xmath11 170 mev . it is noteworthy that ratios involving radially - excited states such as @xmath12 retain their unmodified statistical values .",
    "the kinetic formation model @xcite assumes that heavy quarkonium formation takes place during the entire lifetime of a color - deconfined phase .",
    "predictions for the resulting population require the specification of cross sections for formation and dissociation in the medium .",
    "the motivation for such a scenario in the case of @xmath0 formation has received support from recent lattice calculations of spectral functions .",
    "these indicate that the @xmath0 and @xmath13 will exist in a thermal environment at temperatures well above the deconfinement transition @xcite .",
    "note that this property is likely valid only for the most deeply bound states .",
    "thus , unlike the statistical model , one does not expect a simple relation to exist between the @xmath0 and @xmath14 population .",
    "also in contrast with statistical hadronization , the momentum spectrum of formed @xmath0 will reflect the initially - produced charm quark spectra plus any modification due to interaction with medium .    in principle , both of these formation processes could occur sequentially .",
    "considerable progress has been made @xcite in such a scenario when both bound and unbound charm populations evolve in a thermal fireball .    in the next section we review the basic properties of kinetic in - medium formation of heavy quarkonium , using a specific model for @xmath0 which exhibits the expected general properties .",
    "we have previously found @xcite that the initial phenix data from rhic is able to constrain the model parameters within a fairly broad range , but is unable to confirm or rule out this type of formation . a more detailed test must await comparison with the momentum spectra of the formed @xmath0",
    ". section [ charmquarkdistributions ] contains details of the two specific charm quark distributions which we consider .",
    "one is calculated directly from the initial production process using nlo pqcd amplitudes to generate a set of @xmath2 pair events appropriate for rhic energy .",
    "the other generates a corresponding set of events which would be expected if the charm quarks subsequently come into local thermal equilibrium with the expanding medium before forming the @xmath0 . in section [ kineticpredictions ]",
    "we present a detailed model calculation of the _ normalized _ rapidity and transverse momentum spectra for in - medium @xmath0 formation , using charm quark spectra calculated from the pqcd amplitudes .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that we are searching for a signature in the @xmath0 rapidity and transverse momentum spectra which would indicate the presence of in - medium formation , and which is independent of the absolute magnitude of the formation process .",
    "our results are shown to be quite robust with respect to substantial variations in the model parameters .",
    "section [ pqcd ] contains a specific for rhic results , where we use data for pp and dau interactions to constrain some of the model parameters .",
    "section [ thermal ] presents the corresponding calculations using charm quarks in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "comparisons with predictions of other models and a summary of results complete this presentation .",
    "we first examine the net number of @xmath0 produced in a color - deconfined medium due to the competing reactions of ( a ) formation involving recombination of @xmath15 and @xmath1 and ( b ) dissociation of @xmath0 induced by interactions with constituents of the medium .",
    "the simplest dissociation reaction utilizes absorption of single deconfined gluons in the medium to ionize the color singlet @xmath0 , @xmath16 , resulting in a @xmath2 pair in a color octet state .",
    "this process was originally proposed @xcite as a dynamical counterpart of the static color screening effect .",
    "the inverse of this process then serves as the corresponding formation reaction , in which a @xmath2 pair in a color octet state emits a color octet gluon and falls into the color singlet @xmath0 bound state .",
    "one can then follow the time evolution of charm quark and charmonium numbers according to a boltzmann equation in which the formation and dissociation reactions compete .",

    "the gluon density is determined by the equilibrium value in the medium at each temperature , and the volume must be modeled according to the expansion and cooling profiles of the heavy ion interaction region .",

    "note that the function @xmath28 would be the suppression factor in this scenario if the formation mechanism were neglected .",
    "the initial calculations @xcite used the ratio of nucleon participants to participant density calculated in a glauber model to define a transverse area enclosed by the boundary of the region of color deconfinement . this is supplemented by longitudinal expansion starting at an initial time @xmath29 = 0.5 fm .",
    "transverse expansion was initially neglected , but has been included in subsequent calculations @xcite .",
    "the expansion was taken to be isentropic , which determines the time evolution behavior of the temperature @xmath30 .",
    "the initial value @xmath31 is taken as a parameter , and the final @xmath32 is fixed at the hadronization point .",
    "the reactivities @xmath33 and @xmath34 require specification of cross sections . for @xmath35",
    "we use the ope - based model of gluon dissociation of deeply - bound heavy quarkonium @xcite , which is related via detailed balance to the corresponding @xmath36 . written in terms of the heavy quarkonium reduced mass @xmath37 , gluon momentum in the @xmath2 rest frame @xmath38 and binding energy @xmath39",
    ", the dissociation cross section is    @xmath40    this expression assumes that the heavy quarkonium has a nonrelativistic coulomb bound state spectrum with @xmath41 , and utilizes an operator product expansion in the large @xmath42 limit .",

    "1.0truecm    we should note that the approximations concerning a nonrelativistic coulomb bound state spectrum are somewhat marginal for the charmonium case , although they are better - justified for the upsilon states .",
    "therefore for applications to @xmath0 we will investigate the effects of a considerable range of alternative cross section behavior , as has been done in a number of treatments of @xmath0 production in a purely hadronic scenario@xcite .    the initial model calculations for @xmath0 at rhic @xcite yielded interesting predictions for the centrality behavior of the final population @xmath45 normalized by @xmath6 , or equivalently normalized by the number of binary collisions . due to the quadratic behavior of the formation rates with @xmath6 , one expects an increase with centrality of formed @xmath0 per binary collision , if the formation reaction dominates .",
    "the primary variation in these predictions was due to the initial charm quark momentum distributions , which enter through the calculation of the formation and dissociation reactivities as defined in eq .",
    "[ eqkin ] .",
    "differences of up to a factor of 5 or more resulted as the charm quark momentum distributions varied from thermal ( produced the largest formation efficiency ) through perturbative qcd distributions",
    ". there may be additional uncertainties in overall magnitude .",
    "in particular , an implementation of this process in a transport model calculation @xcite did not result in a large effect at rhic energy .",
    "the first confrontation with experiment involved the initial phenix measurements of @xmath0 at 200 gev @xcite .",
    "values of d@xmath5/dy ( y=0 ) for three centrality bins were extracted , but the most central bin value only yielded an upper bound due to the limitations of statistics . although these limitations prevented a definitive test of the formation model , it was clear that the predictions which followed from thermal charm quark distributions were disfavored .",
    "the pqcd charm quark distributions led to formation rates which were roughly consistent with experiment . a parameter scan involving initial temperature , initial charm quark production , transverse expansion velocity of the deconfined region , and initial @xmath0 production number found a surprisingly large region of parameter space within which the formation mechanism results were consistent with the phenix data points and limits .",
    "it is interesting that these data are also consistent with binary - scaled @xmath0 production in pp interactions @xcite , modified with a small suppression factor . given the sensitivity of the formation process to initial charm production ( both magnitude and momentum spectra ) , even the improved statistics anticipated for the phenix au - au data currently undergoing analysis may not be adequate to differentiate between these distinct possibilities .",
    "fortunately , the momentum spectra for the produced @xmath0 will also be measured . in anticipation of this information",
    ", we then proceed to extend the calculations of the kinetic formation process to include the rapidity and transverse momentum spectra of the final @xmath0 population .",
