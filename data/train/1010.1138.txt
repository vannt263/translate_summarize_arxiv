    "the finding that the quark - gluon plasma created in heavy - ion collisions at rhic ( and soon to be created at the lhc ) appears to be strongly coupled calls for a better theoretical understanding of strongly coupled gauge theories at finite temperature .",
    "until recently , lattice qcd constituted the only viable approach to this problem , albeit only for static observables . with the discovery of the gauge / gravity ( or ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite a new path has opened to attack the problem of strongly coupled gauge theories .",
    "it even allows one to study dynamical processes in the plasma . in our study",
    "we make use of the correspondence to study the screening of a heavy quark - antiquark pair in a strongly coupled plasma . in particular",
    ", we will consider the maximal distance for which the quark and antiquark form a bound state , also called the screening distance , and its dependence on the velocity and the orientation of the pair with respect to the plasma .",
    "a good understanding of this observable might be helpful for diagnosing the properties of the quark - gluon plasma with the help of heavy probes like charmonium or bottomonium .    in its original form",
    "the gauge / gravity correspondence is a holographic duality between supergravity on a five - dimensional @xmath1 space and four - dimensional @xmath0 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory with gauge group @xmath2 in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "the most interesting property of the duality is that the weak - coupling ( small curvature ) limit on the gravity side corresponds to the strong - coupling limit on the gauge theory side .",
    "this makes it possible to solve hard problems in a gauge theory by doing simple calculations on the gravity side .",
    "finite temperature can be accommodated by introducing a black hole in the bulk of the ads space .",
    "although the ads / cft duality was a major leap from a theoretical point of view its use for the phenomenology of qcd is far from obvious . clearly , @xmath0 sym is very different from qcd : it is maximally supersymmetric , features only particles in the adjoint representation of the gauge group , does not have a running coupling ( i.e.  is conformal ) , and exhibits neither confinement nor chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it hence requires some optimism to apply the duality to qcd .",
    "the situation appears somewhat more promising when one considers finite temperature . here ,",
    "qcd is no longer confining and above @xmath4 even appears close to conformal . at the same time",
    ", finite temperature breaks the exact conformal invariance of @xmath0 sym .",
    "in addition , it is feasible that some properties of a gauge theory plasma are to some extent independent of the microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "this is supported by the apparent validity of the hydrodynamical description of various observables in the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "still , it remains unknown whether a gravitational theory dual to qcd exists .    in an attempt to come closer to a potential dual of qcd",
    "one can introduce deformations of the @xmath1 space which break the conformal invariance of the dual theory .",
    "obviously one can think of a vast variety of deformations of this kind , and it will be very difficult to find a particular deformation that reproduces all properties of qcd",
    ". therefore it seems more interesting to ask for universal properties of large classes of such deformations . in particular",
    ", a given observable can be _ robust _ under deformations and change only very little . in this case",
    "one might hope that the value of an observable in @xmath0 sym might already be a good approximation to the value in actual qcd .",
    "an observable can also be _",
    "universal _ in the sense that it does not change at all under deformations , or changes consistently in one direction .",
    "a famous example for a universal observable is the ratio of viscosity to entropy density @xmath5 which acquires the value @xmath6 in all theories with gravity duals @xcite .",
    "this value has even been conjectured to be a lower bound for all possible theories @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will show that the screening distance of a heavy quark - antiquark pair which moves in a hot plasma is in fact a universal observable in a large class of theories .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the main results , a more detailed account of our study will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the gravity dual of @xmath0 sym at finite temperature is an @xmath7 space with a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the @xmath8 factor will not be relevant for our considerations and will be suppressed from the beginning .",
    "the 5-dimensional ads black hole metric is given by @xmath9 with the curvature radius @xmath10 of @xmath1 , and with @xmath11 for each fixed value of the fifth coordinate @xmath12 the metric describes a minkowski space in the remaining four coordinates .",
    "the coordinate @xmath12 has an interpretation as an energy variable in the boundary theory . the holographically dual @xmath0 sym ` lives ' at @xmath13 , that is at the boundary of @xmath1 .",
    "the location @xmath14 of the black hole horizon is related to the temperature @xmath15 of the boundary theory via @xmath16 .",
    "the latter coincides with the hawking temperature of the black hole . a large curvature radius @xmath10 and thus the applicability of classical gravity on the ads side",
    "requires large t hooft coupling @xmath17 on the gauge theory side .",
    "a simple class of deformations of @xmath1 which break conformal invariance in the dual theory is the kty model @xcite in which the original metric is multiplied by an exponential factor depending on @xmath12 such that @xmath18 \\,.\\ ] ] the function @xmath19 is as in , and also here the temperature of the dual field theory is given by @xmath16 .",
    "several properties of qcd thermodynamics are well reproduced with @xmath20 when the dimensionful parameter @xmath21 is chosen as @xmath22 . in order to see how an observable depends on the deformation",
    "it is interesting to study how it changes with the actual conformality - breaking parameter @xmath23 .",
    "( a ` realistic ' range for that parameter is @xmath24 . )",
    "however , the kty model suffers from the problem that it does not solve supergravity equations of motion .",
    "thus , its thermodynamic consistency is questionable .",
    "more recently , also the construction of thermodynamically consistent deformations has been explored @xcite .",
    "it is found that the dilaton potential @xmath25 in the 5-dimensional gravitational action @xmath26 can be chosen such that one obtains a 2-parameter model @xcite of the form @xmath27 with two parameters @xmath23 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "one can use a residual gauge freedom to identify @xmath30 .",
    "the temperature of the dual theory is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the location of the horizon defined by the zero of @xmath33 .",
    "defining @xmath34 one can calculate @xmath35 from supergravity equations of motion .",
    "this model becomes similar to the kty model for the choice @xmath36 , when the exponential factor of is reproduced in the first term of .    from the two - parameter model",
    "one can obtain a further model if one treats @xmath37 not as the dilaton but as an additional scalar field , assuming a trivial dilaton instead . in that case",
    "the einstein frame and the string frame for the calculation of a string on this background coincide . in our figures below we denote this construction as ` einstein frame ' model , while the model described above ( with @xmath37 being the dilaton ) is denoted as ` string frame ' model .    clearly",
    ", the deformed ads metrics described here define dual four - dimensional theories at strong coupling",
    ". however , the lagrangians of these holographically dual theories are not known , and it is not even clear that they correspond to gauge theories",
    ". nevertheless , they are perfectly fine if one is interested in the effects of conformality - breaking on various observables .",

    "for all @xmath40 up to this @xmath62 there are two solutions with different @xmath58 . for @xmath63 , on the other hand , no string configuration connecting the quark and the antiquark exists .",
    "we call this maximally possible distance between the quark and the antiquark the screening distance .",
    "it depends on the rapidity @xmath61 and the orientation angle @xmath52 with respect to the moving plasma , and on the parameters of the deformation of the ads metric .",
    "for the case of @xmath0 sym the behavior of the string configurations up to @xmath62 is shown in fig .",

    "the configuration that stays higher up in the bulk has a smaller energy @xmath39 than the configuration coming closer to the horizon .",
    "the latter can therefore be identified as the unstable solution . with increasing distance @xmath40",
    "the two configurations move towards each other until for the screening distance @xmath62 there is only one solution .",
    "note that none of the solutions touches the horizon .",
    "the computation of the free energy @xmath39 of the quark - antiquark pair from requires the knowledge of the action @xmath66 of a single string hanging down from a moving quark into the bulk of @xmath1 .",
    "this can be obtained from an ads / cft calculation of the drag force acting on the quark @xcite .",
    "that calculation has been extended to the kty model in @xcite .",
    "we have computed the drag force also for the two - parameter models solving supergravity equations of motion .",
    "knowing @xmath66 we obtain the free energy @xmath39 also for the latter models and find its behavior to be qualitatively the same as in @xmath0 sym and in the kty model .",
    "the screening distance should not be confused with the inverse debye mass which is often called screening length .",
    "the latter describes the exponential fall - off of the free energy at distances _ larger _ than our screening distance @xmath62 .",
    "the debye mass can not be obtained from the calculations outlined above .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that it can be related to the exchange of the lowest supergravity modes between two open strings hanging into the bulk at a separation @xmath67 .",
    "we have computed the screening distance for all deformations of the ads space presented in section [ sec : adscft ] .",
    "we find that in all cases the screening distance has a very weak dependence of up to about 10 % on the orientation angle of the @xmath38 pair with respect to the plasma wind .",
    "the dependence on the velocity is dominated by a factor @xmath68 .",
    "the screening distance approaches this dominant behavior at large velocities in all models .",
    "finally , we have studied how the screening distance changes when deformations of the ads space are introduced .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sletascaled.eps ] where we show the dimensionless quantity @xmath69 for the case @xmath70 ( @xmath38 oriented parallel to the plasma wind ) .     of the @xmath38 pair in the plasma as a function of rapidity @xmath61 .",
    "[ sletascaled.eps ] ]    the last factor in this product compensates the dominant behavior of @xmath62 with @xmath61 just discussed so that the differences between the models become visible more clearly . in the kty model",
    "we have chosen @xmath71 for this figure , while in the two - parameter deformations @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we first find that the screening distance is a robust observable . under ` realistic ' deformations of the ads space , i.e.  deformations with thermodynamic observables not drastically different from those of qcd , its value changes only by up to 30 % .",
    "the most remarkable observation is that the screening distance has a universal behavior under the class of deformations studied here . for any given velocity and orientation angle of the @xmath38 pair with respect to the plasma and for all deformations considered here",
    "the value of @xmath62 is larger than in @xmath0 sym . in other words : the screening distance in @xmath0 sym is minimal in the class of theories under consideration for all kinematic parameters .",
    "it suggests itself to speculate that this might also apply to ( all ? ) other theories obtained holographically as deformations of @xmath1 .",
    "in the framework of the gauge / gravity correspondence heavy baryons can be constructed out of @xmath3 heavy quarks situated at the boundary of @xmath1 .",
    "an open string is attached to each of the quarks and ends at a d5-brane that fills the 5 dimensions of @xmath8 and is located at a point @xmath73 in the bulk of @xmath1 .",
    "for such a baryon configuration a similar analysis of screening in a moving plasma can be performed @xcite .",
    "we have extended this study , previously done for @xmath0 sym , to the deformation models described in section [ sec : adscft ] . in analogy to the screening distance of a @xmath38 pair one can define the maximally possible radius of the baryon configuration as a screening distance of the baryon . also here",
    "we find that the screening distance of the baryon in @xmath0 sym is minimal in the class of theories under consideration .",
    "we have calculated the screening distance of a heavy quark - antiquark pair moving in different strongly coupled plasmas which are obtained holographically as duals of deformations of @xmath1 .",
    "our study includes deformations solving supergravity equations of motion .",
    "we observe that the screening distance is a robust observable and changes only little when deformations are introduced .",
    "we find the screening distance in @xmath0 sym to be a minimum among the theories under consideration for all velocities and orientation angles of the pair in the plasma .",
    "a similar behavior is found for heavy baryons moving in strongly coupled plasmas .",
