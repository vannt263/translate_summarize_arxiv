    "superradiance , the collective emission of a sample of atoms , is one of the most celebrated examples of cooperative quantum phenomena , while synchronization is a widespread and paradigmatic emergent behavior in complex systems ( see @xcite and @xcite , respectively , for comprehensive reviews ) . in the most idealized form of superradiance , as first described by dicke in his seminal paper @xcite , the atoms identically interact with the electromagnetic field , a situation encountered , e.g. , when these are confined in a region of space smaller than the wavelength of the resonant modes .",
    "when the initial atomic state is a highly entangled symmetric state , the emission is cooperative and takes place in a rapid burst at a rate proportional to the square of the number of atoms .",
    "this is a clear signature of the presence of constructive quantum interference . if the emission starts from the state in which all the atoms are in their excited state , the collective atomic state acts as an antenna amplifying at a macroscopic level the quantum field fluctuation which trigger the emission . during the last years @xcite , superradiance in the presence of a small number of emitters",
    "was observed by employing trapped ions @xcite and superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "superradiant emission has been shown to be a useful resource towards the realization of single - photon sources @xcite , quantum memories @xcite , and laser cooling @xcite .",
    "in particular , one - dimensional quantum electrodynamics systems are very promising to observe superradiant emission , as the interaction can be maintained over large distances @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such a flexible setup makes it possible to explore different coupling regimes , and then to study the transition from the case of independent emitters to the collective - decay limit .",
    "the counterpart of superradiance , that is , subradiance , was also experimentally observed in the case of a pair of emitters @xcite , and more recently , in a large system of resonant scatterers in an extended and dilute cold - atom sample @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss the connections of superradiance with spontaneous synchronization , a widespread phenomenon of adjustment of the dynamical rhythms of _ different _ interacting systems @xcite .",
    "this emergent phenomenon has been largely studied in classical regimes and multidisciplinary contexts .",
    "recently it has been predicted into the quantum regime , in several platforms including harmonic networks @xcite , mechanical resonators @xcite , atomic and ions setups @xcite .",
    "different approaches have been considered to frame quantum synchronization both referring to local or global -e.g quantum correlation- measures ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for the purpose of this work ,",
    "we address the collective quantum phenomenon of super and subradiance to establish a connection with spontaneous synchronization between the local dynamics of the atoms ; we therefore consider spontaneous synchronization as the adjustment to a common rhythm of local observables as in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we mention that both synchronization and superradiance have also been considered in the presence of external driving . driven synchronization , or entrainment , in the quantum regime",
    "have been considered for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , superradiance in the presence of driving has been identified as lasing with an extremely narrow linewidth @xcite , with a collective emission with an extremely high degree of phase coherence @xcite and quantum phase - locking @xcite .",
    "it can in general be observed in incoherently pumped arrays of strongly interacting atomic quantum dipoles @xcite . indeed , the emission takes place in rapid bursts with large fluctuations in the emission delay time among the various experimental observations @xcite .",
    "further features in the superradiant emissions that are a signature of synchronization take place when the emission is due to a sample of two different , detuned atomic species @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to consider both superradiance and spontaneous synchronization taking place during dynamical relaxation into a common environment , in the absence of external driving , and in the presence of detuning between the atoms . in order to get a full analytic treatment , we consider within the liouville formalism the case of two detuned two - level systems in the presence of dissipation induced by a thermal environment , displaying both superradiant and subradiant emission and dynamical synchronization .",
    "we note that , although collective effects are more prominent in the presence of large numbers of emitters , most features are already present in the decay of just two atoms coupled via dipole interactions @xcite .",
    "we will show that , in the presence of pure dissipation , the two phenomena are different manifestations of a sole property of the model .",
    "indeed , dynamical synchronization is due to the presence of coherence between the ground state and the subradiant state .",
    "thus , this kind of synchronization has a pure quantum origin , as it directly relies on quantum interference .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "our system @xmath0 consists of two atoms that interact with a common bosonic environment @xmath1 .",
    "we will show that this model , already considered in several works @xcite , allows for a fully analytical description of the origin of the connection between the phenomena of synchronization and of super and subradiance .",
    "the two atoms ( described by qubits @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) have different frequencies , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and their free hamiltonian is ( @xmath6 ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 indicate respectively the ground and the excited state of each atom .",

    "the interaction hamiltonian can be thus put under the form @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 .      in the limit of weak system - bath coupling and for zero temperature , the dynamics of the reduced density matrix of the two atoms @xmath25 can be studied performing the born - markov and the secular approximation , taking care about the fact that , in the limit of small detuning @xmath26 , also terms oscillating with frequency @xmath27 must be kept .",
    "the master equation reads @xcite @xmath28 + \\sum_{ij }   \\gamma_{ij } \\left ( \\sigma_i^- \\rho   \\sigma_j^+ -\\frac{1}{2 } \\left\\ { \\sigma_j^+ \\sigma_i^-,\\rho \\right\\ } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 . in the following we use the notation @xmath31 and define @xmath32",

    "henceforth , in order to explore different regimes , we assume to be able to tune the values of these parameters freely .",
    "the dynamics of the system can be studied by adopting the so - called liouville representation of the density matrix . in this representation , the master equation ( [ masterequation ] )",
    "is mapped into a set if linearly coupled differential equations for the elements of the reduced density matrix of the two atoms : @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a vector in the hilbert - schmidt space , @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 . the inner product in the hilbert - schmidt space is defined by @xmath42 .",
    "as shown in appendix [ appendixl ] , the total liouvillian @xmath43 turns out to be the direct sum of 5 terms , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "thus , @xmath46 can be decomposed into 5 independent subspaces , @xmath47 , whose dimensions are @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath49 , @xmath2 and @xmath2 .",

    "we stress that these eigenvectors are not constrained to represent valid states .",
    "in fact , as we will see later , the only physical state that is also an eigenvector of @xmath43 is the ground state , while the totally excited state is the only physical eigenvector of @xmath53 .",
    "this implies that , for instance , a generic @xmath54 can not be taken as initial state . on the other hand ,",

    "the synchronization between averages of arbitrary single atom operators is due to the presence of long standing coherences between the ground state and a state that can be identified as the responsible for subradiant emission , whose experimental detection is known to be more demanding @xcite .",
    "the fact that the decay rate due to such a subradiant state is twice the decay rate of the coherence responsible for synchronization clearly shows that the two phenomena are intimately related and occur on the same timescale .",
    "the case of two atoms we have discussed here offers the advantage that a fully analytical treatment is available which makes patent the liaison between subradiance and synchronization .",
    "the comparison in the case on ensemble of @xmath250 atoms can not be treated analytically and requires numerical or approximated descriptions , like the mean field adopted for instance in ref.@xcite to assess the steady - state in presence of driving . on the other hand , by adding the effects of a dephasing noise , the correspondence between synchronization and collective super and subradiance effects can be altered .",
    "the occurrence of synchronization in classical systems as well as its definition in a broad spectrum of regimes is well established @xcite . when it comes to the quantum realm , it becomes interesting to identify specific quantum signatures of this effect .",
    "recently , there have been many attempts to quantify the appearance of synchronization also through quantum indicators of ( global ) correlations @xcite .",
    "our work represents an original contribution also in this context given that it offers an explanation of spontaneous synchronization of local observables as the manifestation of collective quantum interference .",
    "in other words , the present analytical description through local generic observables dynamics allows to establish how synchronization witnesses a collective quantum phenomenon of subradiance , representing then a genuine quantum feature of synchronization , intimately different from its classical counterpart .",
