    "recently , studies of separable and therefore non entangled states containing other kinds of non classical correlations has attracted increased attention .",
    "one such correlation measure , the quantum discord @xcite , based on the difference between quantum and classical information theories , incorporates more generalized correlations not seen in other non - classical correlations such as entanglement . in particular quantum states with zero entanglement properties are seen to possess quantum discord and classical - quantum states which are necessarily separable have zero quantum discord .",
    "two positive discord states can be mixed to obtain a zero - discord classical state , and two zero - discord classical states in orthogonal directions can be merged to form a non - zero discord state @xcite .",
    "moreover the quantum discord is not restricted by the monogamy rule @xcite which is obeyed by the concurrence measure during entanglement sharing .",
    "such intriguing features of quantum discord has opened up avenues for variety of attributes and applications in non - markovian open quantum systems @xcite , spin array systems @xcite detection of quantum phase transitions @xcite , quantum information processing @xcite and quantum communication @xcite .",

    ", the time evolution of the state comes to a standstill .",
    "the opposite effect which leads to enhancement in time evolution is known as anti - zeno effect ( aze ) and has been observed to be much more ubiquitous than zeno effect @xcite . in unstable systems ,",
    "the occurrence of both qze and aze effects depends on critical parameters like measurement frequencies and environmental noise @xcite .",
    "quantum systems exhibiting both effects include the nanomechanical oscillator @xcite , two - state system coupling to a spin chain environment in transverse magnetic fields @xcite , the non equilibrium steady state spin - fermion model a variant of the kondo model @xcite , damped quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite , disordered spin systems @xcite and trapped atomic systems @xcite . the nanomechanical oscillator system , in particular is of increased interest as it provides an ideal medium for testing quantum effects on a macroscopic scale .",
    "an inherent feature in determining quantum discord involves the one - sided projective measurements on a selected subsystem of the composite quantum state . as is well known , this introduces various counter - intuitive features linked with the measurement process itself with associated controversies linked with the collapse of the wave function of the measured system .",
    "for instance the term  subjective reality \" was introduced by wiseman @xcite to describe the dependence of quantum trajectories on the observer s measurement frame , hence there are several ways that quantum systems which are monitored can be interpreted .",
    "a well - known approach to the widely used collapse postulate involves its replacement by the decoherence process subjected by a detector on the system under study @xcite an alternative scheme involves the idea of quantum zeno subspaces @xcite which provides a convenient platform for interpreting the zeno effect . in this regard",
    ", we note that the active presence of the measuring device is not a requirement for quantum zeno effects to be seen .",
    "this is due to the fact that the zeno effect is linked to the evolution of the non - hermitian schrdinger equation associated with any irreversible mechanism , with the act of measurement being a well known one .",
    "for low precision or unsharp measurements , the device @xmath0 introduces minimal disturbance on the measured system , @xmath1 with state @xmath2 .",
    "the state of the measuring device can be @xmath3 or @xmath4 after the measurement , and is different from its state before measurement , @xmath5 . the composite system @xmath6 proceeds in an approximately unitary fashion as @xmath7 , @xmath7 . in the case of ideal measurements , the resulting state of the system",
    "after measurement generally belongs to the set of the orthonormal basis of the quantum system .",
    "thus for weak or unsharp measurements , the non - hermitian term can be ignored and simplified approaches such as that based on the kofman and kurizky s formalism @xcite can be employed to analyze the effect of measurements .    for highly precise measurements ,",
    "any analysis of the quantum evolution becomes complicated due to the influence of the non - hermitian term , which can be interfere strongly with the dynamics of the measured system .",
    "accordingly , we provide an analysis of the evolution of a measured system involving a non - hermitian term which appears due to highly precise measurements or a strong monitoring device here .",
    "this is performed by applying the results of the non - hermitian hamiltonian of a two - level system originally solved in the context of the link between a decay term and berry s phases by garrison and wright @xcite to our measurement model .",
    "we note that a analogous decay term is explicitly linked with the precision of quantum measurements , a higher measurement precision results in a larger magnitude of this decay term . some ideas introduced in this work",

    "this idea has been examined via the adiabatic theorem @xcite in which different outcomes are eliminated and the system evolves as a group of exclusive quantum zeno subspaces within the total hilbert space .",
    "the measurement procedure therefore has a decomposing effect on the total hilbert space which is partitioned into orthogonal quantum zeno subspaces @xcite .",
    "the initial state remains in a particular invariant subspace , and its survival probability remains unchanged over a period of time .    the effect of measurement on the dynamics of quantum discord can be examined in one of several ways .",
    "an obvious one involves examining the role of zeno effect associated with measurements introduced in one subsystem in order to obtain the conditional entropy , and enabling determination of the classical correlation measure based on optimal measurements .",
    "this procedure forms the basis of determining the quantum discord , as shown in earlier mathematical formulations @xcite . in order to evaluate the quantum discord ,",
    "a set of positive - operator - valued measurements ( povm ) need to be performed in a neighboring partition .",
    "does the measurement process itself induce a distinct category of quantum discord ? how exactly can such optimal measurements be performed without incurring the quantum zeno effect ? what are the key attributes of an optimal measurement and the possible role played by the zeno effect in povm ? in this regard , the consideration of distinct measurement techniques in separate sub - systems will introduce greater depth to the analysis of the quantum discord present in the global system .",

    "exceptional points are singularities @xcite which appear at the branch point of eigenfunctions due to changes in parameters which govern the non - hermitian hamiltonian operator .",
    "these points are known to be located in the vicinity of a level repulsion @xcite and unlike degenerate points , only one eigenfunction exists at the exceptional point due to the merging of two eigenvalues . in the case of the quantum measurements considered in this work",
    ", the exceptional point appears at a critical measurement precision @xmath254=@xmath255 . considering a unit system in which @xmath256=1 , @xmath257 and a unitless time @xmath258",
    ", we obtain @xmath259 . using @xmath260 to denote the unitless measurement precision parameter",
    ", we note that at @xmath261 ( @xmath262 ) , the quantum system undergoes coherent ( incoherent ) tunneling .",
    "similar to the model adopted in the section [ dyn ] , we consider two uncoupled qubits which are entangled initially , but which differ from the earlier treatment in being monitored by independent observers .",
    "these observers assume the role of the reservoirs of harmonic oscillators .",
    "we consider functions @xmath89 and @xmath87 which previously were associated with the decay of the two - level qubit in eq.([fstate ] ) .",
    "the influence of the measurement precision @xmath204 on the quantum discord is investigated by setting @xmath263 = @xmath237 , @xmath264 , and evaluating @xmath265 and @xmath266 as described in section [ dyn ] . unlike in sections",
    "[ ca ] , [ c1b ] , here we examine the dynamics of the quantum discord in the context of a zeno effect manifesting itself even before a measurement outcome is reached and therefore time , @xmath96 satisfies @xmath267 where @xmath17 is the measurement duration .    as the relation @xmath88 is not satisfied for high precise measurements ,",
    "the widely accepted defination of the quantum discord discussed in section [ meas ] may be considered as a limiting case of a more generalized defination that may apply in the case of quantum systems which undergo non - hermitian evolution dynamics . with the inclusion of a non - hermitian term",
    ", the unit trace and strict positivity conditions of the density operator of the quantum system will not be satisfied as well .",
    "with the view of realizing qualitative results of the quantum discord , we therefore relax conditions needed for more rigorous and accurate quantitative approach to evaluating the quantum discord for non - hermitian systems . we illustrate the dynamics of the quantum discord in the two regimes specified by eqs.([eq : co ] ) and ( [ eq : inco ] ) in figures  [ figl]a , b and [ figu]a , b .",
    "these figures show the explicit dependence of the quantum discord on the measurement precision , with appearance of indeterminate values of the quantum discord at very high precision measurements ( low values of @xmath260 ) .",
    "the figures also indicate that a highly precise observer can diminish the non - classical correlation shared between two subsystems , with the tendency to do so increasing with the meaurement precision .",
    "it has to be noted that the quantum discord is evaluated in a reference frame where the observer is not under active consideration as one of the subsystems .",
    "the results will therefore be modified if the monitoring system is included and the quantum system then expands to a group of three subsystems .",
    "we have examined the influence of quantum measurements on quantum discord with consideration of two types of measurements , weak or low precision measurements and highly precise measurements . in the case of ideal weak measurements ,",
    "the results show that the quantum discord present in a two qubit or reservoir system responds to characteristic parameters such as the system bias , duration and frequency of the measurement induced by the decoherence processes as well as the strength of initial entanglement between the two qubit systems . unlike the reservoir - reservoir concurrence @xmath268 , its quantum discord counterpart is more resilient to changes in the measurement duration , @xmath17 . for weak measurements ,",
    "the quantum discord therefore presents as a suitable measure to identify and quantify zeno - anti zeno crossover dynamics in the spin - boson system .",
    "the quantum discord may be used as a reliable measure of quantum processes influenced by the quantum zeno effect such as quantum switching and preparation of decoherence - free states and cluster states @xcite .",
    "another potential application is the possibility of using quantum discord as an efficiency measure of the purification of qubit states which occurs via extraction of a pure state through a series of zeno - like measurements @xcite .",
    "the model used in this work is generic to most quantum systems which undergo zeno - anti - zeno crossover dynamics , and can therefore be extended to other quantum systems @xcite displaying such crossover effects , as mentioned earlier in the text .    for the class of highly precise measurements which introduce maximal",
    "interference in the dynamics of quantum systems , the appearance of singularities introduce complications in the quantum evolution of a measured system .",
    "the quantum discord becomes indeterminate for highly precise quantum measurements .",
    "importantly , the zeno effect fails at very precise measurements as the system does not reside at one level , but possibly transfers available information to the unspecified level of the observer . in future works ,",
    "the direct influence of the zeno effect due to measurements made in one subsystem in order to obtain the conditional entropy in a second subsystem will be considered .",
    "such an approach will allow determination of the influence of the measurement precision on the classical correlation measure in a neighboring partition .",
    "this alternative perspective of the influence of a monitoring device will also allow convenient analysis of the berry phase due to quantum measurements .",
    "finally , we have presented results of the influence of the quantum zeno effect on the concurrence and quantum discord for various biased configurations of the qubit - reservoir system .",
    "we have demonstrated the resilience of the quantum discord measure , in particular it is more robust than the concurrence in the reservoir - reservoir partition subsystem .",
    "the quantum discord which is an intrinsically distinct entity from entanglement , therefore serves as a better indicator , of the crossover point in zeno to anti - zeno transition evident in some spin - boson systems under suitable conditions and for weak measurements .",
    "as to whether this applies to other quantum systems which display both zeno and anti - zeno effects needs further investigation . for highly precise measurements ,",
    "the monitoring device can significantly interfere with the evaluation of the quantum discord and produce indeterminate values of the quantum discord .",
    "with progress in experimental techniques and studies of quantum measurement in optics and nanostructure systems @xcite , investigations involving the quantum discord of entangled systems are expected to play a greater role in future experimental works .",
