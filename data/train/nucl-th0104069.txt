    "some nuclei lying close to the neutron drip line , have one or two very loosely bound valence neutrons which extend too far out in the coordinate space with respect to the charged core  @xcite .",
    "the properties of these neutron halo nuclei @xcite have been reviewed by several authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the halo systems are characterized by large reaction and coulomb dissociation cross sections @xcite . moreover , in the breakup reactions induced by these nuclei , the angular distributions of neutrons measured in coincidence with the core nuclei  @xcite are strongly forward peaked and the parallel momentum distributions of the core fragments have very narrow widths @xcite . due to their strikingly different properties in comparison to the stable systems ,",
    "the halo nuclei provide a stringent test of the nuclear structure models developed for the study of the nuclei lying close to the line of stability .    the coulomb breakup , which is a significant reaction channel in the scattering of the halo nuclei on stable heavy targets , is a convenient tool to investigate their structure . for instance",
    ", it would place constraints on their electric dipole response @xcite . of course , in the serber @xcite type of models @xcite",
    ", the breakup cross sections are directly related to the momentum space wave function of the projectile ground state .",
    "the studies of the coulomb dissociation of the weakly bound nuclei are also of interest due to their application in determining the cross sections of the astrophysically interesting radiative capture reactions at solar temperatures @xcite .",
    "the distinct advantage of the coulomb breakup is that the perturbation due to the electric field of the nucleus is known exactly .",
    "recently , a full quantum mechanical theory of the coulomb breakup reactions has been formulated @xcite within the post form distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) .",
    "the finite range effects are included in this theory ( to be referred as frdwba ) which can be applied to projectiles of any ground state angular momentum structure . in this paper",
    ", we show that definite information about the ground state structure of the one - neutron halo nuclei ( @xmath0 , @xmath1be and @xmath2c ) can be obtained by comparing the predictions of this theory with the data on the breakup reactions of these projectiles on heavy target nuclei .",
    "this is possible because the calculated energy , angular and longitudinal momentum distributions of the projectile fragments are strongly selective about the ground state wave function of the projectile .",
    "we also discuss the application of this theory to the one - neutron removal reactions of the type a(a , b@xmath3)x where the partial cross sections for transitions to the excited bound states of the core are measured .",
    "these reactions provide a more versatile tool for investigating the spectroscopy of the halo nuclei .",
    "in section 2 , we present a very brief review of the post form dwba theory of the coulomb breakup reactions .",
    "the applications of the theory to two types of the breakup reactions , a(a , b or n)x and a(a , b@xmath3)x , are discussed in section 3 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "we consider the reaction @xmath4 , where the projectile @xmath5 breaks up into fragments @xmath6 ( charged ) and @xmath7 ( uncharged ) in the coulomb field of a target @xmath8 .",
    "the post form dwba @xmath9 - matrix for this case is @xmath10 where @xmath11 with @xmath12 . in eq .",
    "( [ ramp ] ) , @xmath13 is the orbital angular momentum for the relative motion between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this is coupled to the spin of @xmath7 and the resultant @xmath14 is coupled to the spin of ( the inert core ) @xmath6 to get the spin of @xmath5 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "@xmath16 are the distorted waves for relative motions of the respective systems ( @xmath6 or @xmath5 ) with respect to the target .",
    "@xmath17 is the interaction between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the charged fragment @xmath6 interacts with the target by a point coulomb interaction and hence @xmath18 is a coulomb distorted wave with incoming wave boundary condition . for the pure coulomb breakup ,",
    "relative motion wave function between the target and the uncharged fragment @xmath7 is a plane wave .",
    "the radial and angular parts of the wave function associated with the relative motion of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the ground state of the projectile is given by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that in eq .",
    "( [ radint ] ) , the interaction of the target with the fragments is included to all orders .",
    "( [ radint ] ) involves a six dimensional integral which makes its evaluation quite complicated .",
    "the problem gets further acute due to the fact that the integrand involves three scattering waves which have oscillatory behavior asymptotically .",
    "therefore , approximate methods have been used , such as the zero range approximation ( zra ) @xcite , in which @xmath21 is replaced by a delta function , or the baur - trautmann approximation ( bta ) @xcite , where the coordinate of the projectile - target system is replaced by that of the core - target system .",
    "both these approximations lead to a factorization of the amplitude ( eq .",
    "3 ) into two independent parts , which reduces the computational complexity . however , both these methods have limitations and their application to the reactions of the halo nuclei is questionable .    in the frdwba theory ,",
    "the coulomb distorted wave of particle @xmath6 in the final channel is written as @xmath22 eq .",
    "( [ lma ] ) represents an exact taylor series expansion about @xmath23 if @xmath24 is treated exactly .",
    "however , instead of doing this we employ a local momentum approximation , where the magnitude of the local momentum @xmath25 is taken to be @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ lmv ] ) , @xmath27 is the reduced mass of the @xmath28 system , @xmath29 is the energy of particle @xmath6 relative to the target in the c.m .",
    "system and @xmath30 is the coulomb potential between @xmath6 and the target at a distance @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the local momentum @xmath32 is evaluated at some distance @xmath31 , and its magnitude is held fixed for all the values of @xmath33 . as is discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the results of our calculations are almost independent of the choice of the direction the local momentum .",
    "therefore , we have taken the directions of @xmath32 and @xmath34 to be the same in all the calculations presented in this paper . for more details",

    "( [ lma ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ ramp ] , [ radint ] ) we get the following factorized form of the reduced amplitude @xmath35    recently , a theory of the coulomb breakup has been developed within an adiabatic ( ad ) model @xcite , where one assumes that the excitation of the projectile is such that the relative energy ( @xmath36 ) of the @xmath37 system is quite small as compared to the total incident energy , which allows @xmath36 to be replaced by the constant separation energy of the fragments in the projectile ground state .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that under these conditions the wave function @xmath38 has an exact solution which when substituted in the post form t - matrix leads to its factorization in the same way as eq .",
    "( [ famp ] ) .",
    "this amplitude differs from that of the frdwba only in the form factor part ( first term ) , which is evaluated here at the momentum transfer @xmath39 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for the breakup of projectiles with very small one - neutron separation energies and a @xmath40-wave neutron - core relative relative motion in its ground state , the results of the adiabatic model and the frdwba are almost identical to each other .",
    "although the adiabatic model does not make the weak coupling approximation of the dwba , yet it necessarily requires one of the fragments ( in this case @xmath7 ) to be chargeless .",
    "in contrast , the frdwba can , in principle , be applied to cases where both the fragments @xmath6 and @xmath7 are charged @xcite .",
    "for the ground state of @xmath1be , we have considered the following configurations :    \\(a ) a @xmath40  wave valence neutron coupled to the @xmath41 @xmath42be core [ @xmath43be@xmath44 with a one - neutron separation energy ( @xmath45 ) of 504 kev and a spectroscopic factor ( sf ) of 0.74 @xcite ,    \\(b ) a @xmath46  wave valence neutron coupled to the @xmath47 @xmath42be core [ @xmath48be@xmath49 with a one - neutron separation energy of 3.872 mev ( which is the sum of energy of the excited 2@xmath50 core ( 3.368 mev ) and @xmath45 ) with a sf of 0.17 , and    \\(c ) an admixture of these two configurations with the sf values of 0.74 and 0.20 respectively @xcite .    in each case , the single particle wave function is constructed by assuming the valence neutron-@xmath42be interaction to be of the woods - saxon type whose depth is adjusted to reproduce the corresponding value of the binding energy with fixed values of the radius and the diffuseness parameters ( taken to be 1.15 fm and 0.5 fm , respectively ) . for configuration ( a )",
    ", this gives a potential depth of 71.03 mev , a root mean square ( rms ) radius for the valence neutron of 6.7 fm , and a rms radius for @xmath1be of 2.91 fm when the size of the @xmath42be core is taken to be 2.28 fm @xcite .",
    "for the case of @xmath2c , there is a large uncertainty in the value of the last neutron separation energy ( @xmath51 ) with quoted values varying between 0.160 mev  1.0 mev @xcite .",
    "most of the available data on the coulomb dissociation of @xmath2c can be satisfactorily explained within the finite range dwba theory with the one - neutron separation energy of 530 kev @xcite . the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) @xcite as well as shell model ( with warburton - brown effective interaction )",
    "@xcite calculations predict the spin - parity of the ground state of this nucleus to be @xmath52 .",
    "we have examined two possibilities for the ground state structure of @xmath2c :    \\(i ) different binding energies ( 530 kev and 160 kev ) with the same configuration for the @xmath2c ground state [ @xmath53c@xmath44 , and    \\(ii ) different configurations [ @xmath53c@xmath44 and [ @xmath54c@xmath44 with the same binding energy ( 530 kev ) for the @xmath2c ground state .    a spectroscopic factor of 1.0 has been used for each of the configuration , and the corresponding single particle wave functions have been constructed in the same way as in the case of @xmath1be .",

    "this reflects the narrow width of the transverse momentum distribution of the valence neutron .",
    "the neutron halo structure is also reflected in the narrow widths of the parallel momentum distribution ( pmd ) of the charged breakup fragments emitted in breakup reactions induced by the halo nuclei .",
    "this is because the pmd has been found to be least affected by the reaction mechanism @xcite and therefore , a narrow pmd can be related to a long tail in the matter distribution in the coordinate space via heisenberg s uncertainty principle .    in fig . 1 , we compare the calculated and measured exclusive neutron angular distribution @xmath57 as a function of the neutron angle @xmath58 for the above reaction on a au target at the beam energy of 41 mev / nucleon .",
    "calculations are shown for both configurations ( a ) ( solid line ) and ( b ) ( dot - dashed line ) for the @xmath1be ground state .",

    "the calculated cross sections are normalized to the peak values of the data points in both the cases .",
    "while the full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the distributions calculated with the @xmath40-wave configuration are narrow for both the targets ( 44 mev / c and 43 mev / c for the u and ta , respectively ) , they turn out to be quite broad with the @xmath46-wave configuration .",
    "the narrow widths agree well with the averaged experimental value of 43.6@xmath591.1 mev / c @xcite .",
    "therefore , the configuration ( a ) is favored by this data too .",

    "we see that , while the calculations done with the @xmath40-wave configuration reproduce the data well near the peak region , the @xmath46-wave configuration underpredicts the data by several orders of magnitude .",
    "however , the data at higher relative energies can not be explained by our calculations .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the nuclear breakup effects , which can contribute substantially @xcite at the higher relative energies ( for @xmath60 @xmath61 0.6 mev ) , are not included in these calculations . of course ,",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite claim that their data have been corrected for these contributions .",
    "however , the procedure adopted by them for this purpose may not be adequate @xcite . for a proper description of the data ,",
    "both coulomb and nuclear breakup contributions should be calculated on the same footing and corresponding amplitudes should be added coherently to get the cross sections .",
    "therefore , for @xmath1be , a @xmath40  wave configuration [ @xmath43be@xmath44 spectroscopic factor of 0.74 for its ground state provides best agreement with the experimental data in all the cases .",

    "as can be seen from the upper part of this figure , the experimental data clearly favor @xmath51 = 0.53 mev with the @xmath40  wave n-@xmath62c relative motion in the ground state of @xmath2c .    in the lower part of fig .",
    "4 , we have shown the results obtained with the @xmath46  wave relative motion for this system ( with @xmath51 = 0.53 mev ) and have compared it with that obtained with a @xmath40  wave relative motion with the same value of the binding energy . as can be seen ,",

    "thus these data favor a configuration [ @xmath53c@xmath44 , with a one - neutron separation energy of 0.530 mev for the ground state of @xmath2c .",
    "the narrow width of the pmd provides support to the presence of a one - neutron halo structure in @xmath2c .",
    "-0.3 in    in fig . 5",
    ", we have shown the results of our frdwba calculations for the the relative energy spectrum for the breakup of @xmath2c on pb at the beam energy of 67 mev / nucleon .",
    "the experimental data is taken from @xcite . the angular integration for the @xmath2c center of mass",
    "is done up to the grazing angle of 2.5@xmath63 .",
    "it can be seen that in this case also the best agreement with the data ( near the peak position ) is obtained with the @xmath40  wave configuration with @xmath51 = 0.53 mev .",
    "calculations done with the @xmath46  state configuration for both 530 kev and 160 kev one - neutron separation energy fails to reproduce the data . at the same time",
    ", those performed with the @xmath40  state configuration but with @xmath51 = 0.16 mev overestimates the data by at least an order of magnitude and also fail to reproduce its peak position . however , as in the case of @xmath1be , the calculations underestimate the relative energy spectrum for larger values of relative energies , and the proper consideration of the nuclear breakup effects is necessary to explain the data in this region .    therefore , the results for the pmd of @xmath62c and the relative energy spectrum of the @xmath64 + @xmath62c system are described best with a ground state configuration of @xmath2c of [ @xmath53c@xmath44 , with a one - neutron separation energy of 530 kev and a spectroscopic factor of 1 .      in the ( a , b@xmath3 ) type of reactions ,",
    "one nucleon ( usually the valence or halo ) is removed from the projectile ( a ) in its breakup reaction in the field of a target nucleus and the states of the core fragment ( b ) populated in this reaction are identified by their gamma ( @xmath3 ) decay .",
    "the intensities of the decay photons are used to determine the partial breakup cross sections to different core states .",
    "the signatures of the orbital angular momentum @xmath13 associated with the relative motion of core states with respect to the valence nucleon ( removed from the projectile ) are provided by the measured parallel momentum distributions of the core states ( see fig .",
    "this provides a new and more versatile technique for investigating the spectroscopy of nuclei near the drip line @xcite .",
    "it mixes the power of the conventional transfer reaction ( sensitivity to the @xmath13 value of the removed neutron ) with the practical advantage of the breakup reactions ( larger cross sections ) .",
    "-0.3 in    most of the studies of the ( a , b@xmath3 ) reaction performed so far involve a light @xmath65be target , where the breakup process is governed almost entirely by only the nuclear interaction between the projectile fragments and the target .",
    "it would be interesting to know if there are quantitative differences in the @xmath66 populations of the core states in the pure coulomb breakup mechanism , as compared to those observed in the pure nuclear breakup process . in fig .",
    "6 , we compare the pure coulomb partial cross sections for the @xmath1be breakup on a @xmath67pb target ( shown in the left panel ) with the pure nuclear ones ( shown in the right panel ) corresponding to the breakup of @xmath1be on a @xmath65be target ( taken from @xcite ) at the beam energy of 60 mev / nucleon .",
    "both the cross sections are calculated for transitions to the four @xmath42be final states .",
    "the ground ( 0@xmath50 ) and excited ( 3.368 mev ) ( 2@xmath50 ) states were assumed to correspond to the configurations [ 1@xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath42be(@xmath41 ) ] and [ 0@xmath70 @xmath69 @xmath42be(@xmath47 ) ] , respectively .",
    "the corresponding sf values for these two configurations were taken to be 0.74 and 0.20 , respectively , the excited 1@xmath71 ( 5.956 mev ) and 2@xmath71 ( 6.256 mev ) states were assumed to stem from the configurations [ 0@xmath72 @xmath69 @xmath42be(@xmath73 ) ] and [ 0@xmath72 @xmath69 @xmath42be(@xmath74 ) ] , respectively , with the sf values of 0.69 and 0.58 , respectively . in each case , the neutron single particle wave function is calculated in the same way as described in section 3.1 .",
    "it is evident that in the case of pure coulomb breakup of a projectile with a halo ground state , most of the cross section goes to the ground state ( 0@xmath50 ) of the core .",
    "the sum of the partial cross sections corresponding to all the excited states is less than 1@xmath75 of that to the ground state .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the case of the lighter target where partial cross sections corresponding to all the excited states represent about 22@xmath75 of the total .",
    "similar results have been obtained for the @xmath2c projectile ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "indeed , in the measurements @xcite of the ( a , b@xmath3 ) type of reactions with @xmath76b projectile on @xmath77au gold target at the beam energy of 60 mev / nucleon no core - excited transitions were seen .",
    "therefore , this lends support to our observation .",
    "the transitions to the excited states of the core corresponding to the non - zero @xmath13-values of the neutron - core relative motion , are quite weak in the pure coulomb breakup reaction as compared to those in the nuclear breakup process . therefore , ( a , b@xmath3 ) type of reaction on a heavy target is potentially a more useful tool for investigating the properties of the ground state of the core fragments .",
    "the suppression of the cross sections to the higher states can be understood from the strong dependence of the coulomb breakup cross sections on the one - neutron separation energy ( se ) . in the case of the nuclear breakup , the dependence of the cross section on se is comparatively weaker .",
    "this could be understood from the fact that nuclear breakup cross sections are sensitive to the @xmath37 relative wave functions at shorter distances which do not change much with changes in the value of se .",
    "finite range dwba theory of the coulomb breakup reactions provides a very powerful tool to probe the ground state structure of the one - neutron halo nuclei .",
    "its predictions for most of the breakup observable are quite sensitive to the ground state configuration of the projectile .",
    "therefore , their comparison with the experimental breakup data can be used to put constraints on the ground state structure of the one - neutron halo nuclei .",
    "the coulomb dominated one - neutron removal reaction of the type ( a , b@xmath3 ) populates predominantly the ground state of the core fragment .",
    "therefore , such studies would be very useful in investigating the ground state structure of the halo nuclei for those partitions in which the core fragment remains in its ground state ."
