    "coherent vector meson production from nuclei has proven to be a useful tool for studying the structure of vector mesons . in the very high energy , small angle scattering regime ,",
    "well above the threshold for vector meson production , the large volume of available experimental data involving proton targets consistently supports the validity of the vector meson dominance  ( vmd ) model for small photon virtualities  @xcite .",
    "this , combined with the onset of the eikonal regime in the diffractive region has lead to the development of a successful theoretical framework for the description of vector meson photo - production off nuclei based on the combined vmd model and glauber theory of hadron - nuclei rescattering  @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the vmd - glauber framework arises from the fact that at high energies the basic @xmath1 and @xmath2 amplitudes vary slowly with the total energy of the @xmath3 system relative to the range of important energies in the deuteron wavefunction .",
    "this observation leads to the factorizability of the basic @xmath4 amplitude from the momentum space integral , and yields the conventional glauber multiple scattering series consisting of non - relativistic form factors and elementary scattering amplitudes .",
    "the vmd - glauber theory has lead , in particular , to the demonstration that the coherent photo - production of vector mesons off the deuteron at large @xmath5 is defined mainly by the rescattering contribution @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath6 amplitude appears in the double scattering term , one may use nuclear photo - production reactions to study the properties of vector mesons  @xcite . by choosing different @xmath7",
    ", one can control the relative distance at which rescattering may occur , which allows one to investigate the space - time evolution of hadronic systems produced in electro(photo)- production .",
    "the above program can be extended to the study of coherent vector electro - production at large @xmath8 . in this case ,",
    "coherent vector meson production from the deuteron can be used to study color coherence / transparency phenomena in vector meson electro - production at high @xmath8 .",
    "the onset of color transparency will reveal itself through the substantial drop in the double scattering contribution with an increase of @xmath8 as opposed to the nearly energy independent behavior of the double scattering term for the generalized vmd prediction  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider yet another venue of application for vector meson photo - production off nuclear targets by considering photo - production in the intermediate range of energies starting a few gevs above the threshold .",
    "these reactions have great potential for probing several effects such as non - diffractive , ozi violating mechanisms for vector meson production mesons , in - medium modifications of vector mesons , the importance of `` non - ideal '' @xmath9 mixing , and other new mechanisms for vector meson production ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to learn whether the @xmath0-meson is produced with a small enough transverse size that quark degrees of freedom may become relevant , as in the case of @xmath10-production . actually , in the case of @xmath10 , the cross section of the @xmath11 interaction @xmath12 , @xcite estimated based on the a - dependence of @xmath10 photo - production at energies @xmath13  gev , is much larger than the estimate based on the vdm : @xmath14 .",
    "this is likely due to the color transparency phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "a natural question is whether a trace of this effect remains in the case of @xmath0-production .",
    "jefferson lab has produced data for @xmath0 production that is currently being analyzed .",
    "the interest in intermediate energy reactions makes it necessary to re - evaluate the assumptions of the traditional glauber series method , and to develop a new theoretical approach .",
    "this paper addresses the issues one must face when considering photon energies large enough that the eikonal approximation is an appropriate description of hadronic re - interactions , but not large enough that it is appropriate to neglect vector meson masses in kinematical calculations or any non - trivial s - dependence of the amplitude for photo - production of vector mesons from the nucleon . furthermore , for small photon energies ( @xmath15  gev ) the vmd hypothesis becomes suspect as a description of the @xmath16 amplitude .",
    "therefore , we will not restrict ourselves to vmd model of @xmath16 amplitude , considering instead the adequately parameterized form of photon - nucleon amplitudes .",
    "we argue in this paper that there may be a range of photon energies for which the eikonal approximation is valid , but where the usual glauber theory assumptions of factorization and ultra - relativistic kinematics break down .",
    "although we retain the eikonal approximation , our approach is distinctly different from the usual glauber - vmd approach . in particular ,",
    "one of the basic assumptions used in the glauber approach is that the basic @xmath1 and @xmath17 cross sections are slowly varying functions of center of mass energy and that the small fermi momentum of the nucleons can be neglected in the evaluation of the total center of mass energy of the @xmath3 and @xmath18 systems .",
    "these assumptions result in the usual factorizability already discussed above . at intermediate energies , however",
    ", the photon energy is comparable to the vector meson mass , and the basic amplitude may gain non - trivial energy dependence due to the fact that regge theory may be inadequate at intermediate photon energies .",
    "the usual smooth , slow rise in the total @xmath4 cross section characteristic of high energy diffractive scattering may be absent at intermediate energies .",
    "fermi motion effects thereby destroy the factorizability of nuclear scattering into basic amplitudes and form factors .",
    "also , the longitudinal momentum transfered ( proportional to @xmath19 ) plays an important role as compared to reactions in the diffractive regime and further calls into question the factorization assumption .",
    "earlier work ( e.g.  @xcite ) has considered the effect of longitudinal momentum transfers , but the breakdown of factorization has not been discussed .    to summarize , the particular reaction we are interested in in this paper is the coherent photoproduction of vector mesons from the deuteron .",
    "however , the energy dependence of the @xmath16 will require that we account for fermi motion effects which , in turn , will require that we account for non - factorization effects .",
    "in the derivation of the total @xmath20 amplitude we will use the generalized eikonal approximation ( gea ) with effective feynman diagram rules ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . this is the approximation , valid at appropriately high energies , that allows us to derive the scattering amplitudes starting with corresponding effective feynman diagrams while neglecting multiple scattering from the same nucleon .",
    "this is very similar to the gea approach that has been applied to the @xmath21 reactions on the nucleus  @xcite .    by maintaining the result in terms of momentum space integrals , within the gea , transferred longitudinal momentum and fermi motion effects may be explicitly taken into account consistently . in our derivations , we keep only the corrections to the basic amplitudes that are of linear order in longitudinal exchanged momentum or nucleon momentum ( neglecting order @xmath22 corrections , where @xmath23 is the bound state nucleon momentum ) .",
    "this allows us to relate the @xmath24 transition vertex to the nonrelativistic wavefunction of the deuteron .",
    "since dynamical , model - dependent corrections related to the n - n interaction are expected to be of quadratic or higher order in nucleon momentum , then linear order corrections arising from intermediate energy kinematics should be taken into account _ before _ any specific theory of the basic bound state amplitude that deviates from the nearly flat behavior of regge theory is considered and used in the typical glauber theory approach .    as it was explained above",
    ", we work in the kinematic regime in which diffractive behavior is not yet fully established but the momenta of the produced vector mesons are high enough that the eikonal approximation for the hadronic rescatterings is justified . as a result , a formalism should be maintained that allows the @xmath16 and the @xmath25 amplitudes to be independently modeled .",
    "fitting data to our modified form of the glauber theory by using the @xmath26 amplitude as a parameter allows one to infer a value for the @xmath25 cross section .",
    "we emphasize that the main steps of this paper have been known for several decades ; the glauber theory in terms of effective feynman diagrams was established in ref .",
    "the effects of longitudinal momentum transfer in terms of phase shifts have also been studied  @xcite .",
    "however , as far as we are aware , there has never been direct numerical study of the effect of the breakdown of factorization in glauber theory as it applies vector meson production .",
    "( the effects of factorization break - down in proton knock - out have been studied in ref .",
    "one result that we find is that the breakdown of factorization persists even in the limit that off - shell effects in the bound state nucleon amplitudes are negligible .",

    "this require further elaboration : the gea is the `` straight line '' approximation in that the incident particle follows a nearly straight line path through the nucleus .",

[ fig : figure9 ] is smaller than what is found in the standard glauber calculation .    at high energies we expect the two methods to agree , and they do within the range of experimental uncertainties of non - relativistic deuteron form factors .",
    "the fact that the two methods have slight disagreement at high energies is a reflection of the fact that , even at high energies , we have not calculated the form factor with exactly the same approximation as in the usual glauber approach . in the usual non - relativistic form factor , any dependence on longitudinal transferred momentum is ignored .",
    "if one takes into account exact kinematics , one finds that there are two distinct effects which may cause this assumption to be violated .",

    ", we could evaluate the basic amplitude at @xmath224 where @xmath220 is the minimum @xmath7 for the free , on - shell nucleon . with this second method for choosing which value of @xmath7 to use in the basic amplitude",
    ", the basic amplitude behaves like the free , on - shell nucleon amplitude in the region of @xmath7 close to @xmath191 .",
    "hence , with this method , we are probably underestimating the value of the basic amplitude . in the high energy limit ,",
    "@xmath225 vanishes and the two amplitudes are equal , and the difference between the two provides an estimate of the off - shell effects .",
    "( note that we must specify a value for @xmath105 in order to make a comparison . )",
    "any amplitude which has a relatively slow and smooth variation with @xmath7 will yield a small difference between @xmath58 and @xmath226 .",
    "we made this comparison for @xmath0-meson production with the parameterization in appendix  [ sec : app4 ] and we find only a few percent deviation .",
    "we conclude that at a few gev above threshold it is reasonable to continue using the on - shell amplitude of the nucleon .",
    "the main conclusion of this paper is that the effect of factorization break - down is significant for intermediate photon energies .",
    "the glauber approach is , strictly , only applicable for the case of very high photon energies .",
    "however , there are current attempts to apply the factorization assumption of glauber theory to the @xmath0-meson production reaction at energies as low as @xmath227  gev in both experimental and theoretical research . therefore , in order to salvage the situation in the energy range of a few gevs above threshold , we have outlined steps one must follow in order to obtain corrections to leading order in the bound nucleon momentum and transferred momentum .",
    "the main steps are essentially those of the original diagrammatic formulation of glauber theory in terms of momentum space integrals and its extension to vector meson production  @xcite ; we have started with most of the original assumptions , but we have removed the assumptions of factorizability , ultra - relativistic kinematics or vmd for the basic amplitudes , and we have numerically evaluated all integrals directly without any factorization approximations . by using a simple model for the basic amplitude ( we restore vmd for the simple model ) based on a fit to old and recent data , we have shown that , away from @xmath201 , ignoring fermi motion ( and the resulting breakdown of factorizability ) can lead to a significant error in basic cross sections extracted from @xmath228 cross section data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure9 ] ) .",
    "this effect will certainly need to be taken into account in future searches for new production mechanisms at intermediate energies .",
    "the breakdown in factorizability arises as a consequence of both the non - negligible longitudinal momentum exchanged , and the non - negligible fermi motion .",
    "an important point is that a key source of the departure from factorizability is the inadequacy of assuming the nearly flat s - dependence predicted by regge theory in the basic amplitudes .",
    "therefore , models of the basic @xmath16 amplitude or the @xmath229 amplitude which depart significantly from nearly flat s - dependence must include _ at least _ the linear order nucleon momentum corrections of this paper if they are to be used in calculations with a deuteron target .",
    "this correction arises purely from the fact that the bound nucleons have non - vanishing momentum and it must be included regardless of the details of a particular model of the basic amplitudes . for the case of @xmath0-meson production",
    ", we find that our approach is reasonable when we use our particular simple model of the basic amplitude and as long as the photon energy is around @xmath52  gev or higher and @xmath7 is not too close to @xmath191 .",
    "however , we stress that in a model of the basic @xmath16 amplitude that predicts much wilder energy dependence at intermediate energies than what we have assumed , the linear order corrections will not be sufficient , and a complete and precise understanding of the @xmath55 interaction and the bound state nucleon amplitudes are necessary in order to make a correct calculation . for the @xmath0-meson photo - production cross section ( @xmath230  gev ) , the amplitude may vary wildly with energy at @xmath200  gev or lower because of the very close proximity to threshold . for this reason , and because the eikonal approximation begins to break down , basic cross sections for photo - production from the nucleon extracted from data for photo - production from the deuteron are suspect for photon energies less than or equal to @xmath231  gev for the @xmath0 production reaction .    in our sample calculation , we observe that the contribution from double scattering becomes numerically suppressed relative to the born approximation as the incident photon energy decreases . however , the multiple scattering terms are what lead to the characteristic a - dependence of the glauber theory for complex nuclei , @xmath232 .",
    "this suggests that an extension of our methods to complex nuclei will yield a rather different a - dependence for the cross section at intermediate energies from what is predicted at high energies .",
    "hence , there will need to be a revision in efforts to extract basic cross sections from nuclear data using extrapolations in @xmath233 .",
    "the extension to complex nuclei , however , requires much more work .",
    "we note , however , that data given in ref .",
    "@xcite were interpreted as implying a very high @xmath213 total cross section on the basis of a very traditional glauber approach at energies of only a few gevs .",
    "therefore , our next step will be to determine how the non - factorization effects discussed in this paper affect a general , incoherent glauber series .",
    "furthermore , since it is apparent that spin effects will be important , then a generalization with spin - dependent amplitudes will be needed .",
    "we have purposefully over - simplified our analysis here for the purposes of demonstration .",
    "in particular , we have applied the vmd hypothesis at energies where it is suspect and we have neglected fluctuations and @xmath9 mixing in the intermediate vector meson in the double scattering term .",
    "further analysis will need to include these effects . in order to make further numerical progress",
    ", we will need firmer parameterizations of the basic cross sections for vector meson production from nucleons . for theoretical work",
    ", it would be useful for the purposes of comparison to have a widely agreed upon set of parameterizations .",
    "we also need to consider the calculation in light - cone coordinates and the effects of spin - flip .",
    "we will pursue these issues in future work .",
    "finally , we will need a complete understanding of the off - shell amplitudes if we are to take into account the higher order momentum corrections that will be necessary just at the threshold , though we have argued that for smoothly varying basic cross sections , the effect of off - shellness in the amplitudes is small relative to the effect of linear order corrections in nucleon momentum .",
    "rogers thanks steve heppelmann and david landy for useful discussions , and isaac mognet and nick conklin for sharing computer facilities .",
    "this work is supported by doe grants under contract de - fg02 - 01er-41172 and de - fg02 - 93er40771 .",
    "here we describe the fits of the basic cross sections that we used for our sample calculations .",
    "the object here is not necessarily to produce very accurate parameterizations , but rather to devise parameterizations that demonstrate the effects of glauber factorization while being consistent with recent and established experimental results .",
    "first we consider the @xmath234 differential cross section .",
    "for this we use a simple exponential @xmath7-dependence with a typical exponential slope of @xmath235  gev@xmath168 and an over all normalization of @xmath236  @xmath237/gev@xmath186 .",
    "( see , e.g. ref .",
    "it is known that at low energies the normalization undergoes a steep rise .",
    "we take this into account in our calculation by including a factor of @xmath238 in the overall normalization and then doing a least squares fit to obtain the parameter , @xmath101 .",
    "we find that @xmath239 .",
    "the cross section is thus , @xmath240 the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhofit ] .",
    "as is seen in the main part of the text , the variation is too weak to introduce a very large effect on the final @xmath241 cross section from fermi motion .",
    "the case of the @xmath0-meson is more complicated due to the irregular behavior near threshold .",
    "the main point is to interpolate smoothly between recent low energy data and the standard higher energy parameterization . the normalization of the low energy data , taken from recent experimental work in ref .",
    "@xcite , is obtained from an effective pomeron and pseudo - scalar exchange model  @xcite as it was presented in ref .",
    "we continue to use this so that our model will be consistent with current work .",
    "the high energy parameterization was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by fitting a diffraction - like cross section to a large set of experimental data .",
    "we want to interpolate quickly but smoothly between the low energy and high energy data .",
    "there is an exponential factor , @xmath242 , associated with both the high and the low energy behavior , but the slope , @xmath243 , is around @xmath244  gev@xmath168 for the low energy behavior ( @xmath245  gev ) while it is around @xmath246  gev@xmath168 for the high energy behavior .",
    "thus , for the exponential slope we use , @xmath247 next , for the low energy region , there is no regge slope .",
    "that is , @xmath248 in the factor , @xmath249 .",
    "but , in the high energy region , @xmath250  gev@xmath168 .",
    "thus , we use , @xmath251 now we consider the behavior of @xmath252 for photo - production of the @xmath0-meson from a proton target . the high energy parameterization in ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath253 and , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , over - all units will be understood to be @xmath254 . in order to match to the data of ref .",
    "@xcite we want a peak to appear at around @xmath255  gev .",
    "therefore , we adjust the parameterization to , @xmath256 we use eq.([param4 ] ) to fit to the low energy data of ref .",
    "@xcite while assuring that the high energy parameterization of eq.([param3 ] ) is reproduced at high energies .",
    "we find : @xmath257 , @xmath258  gev@xmath168 , and @xmath259  gev@xmath168 .",
    "finally , we note that the low energy data is actually given for @xmath260 rather than @xmath261 .",
    "therefore , we must be sure to include a factor of @xmath262 in the final result for @xmath263 .",
    "the result of our parameterization for @xmath263 for the @xmath0-meson is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phifit ] .",
    "we point out that in the intermediate energy range at around @xmath180  gev , the energy dependence is not completely flat , but it is smooth , and slow enough that its effect may be treated as a small correction .    . ]",
    "in this appendix , we give an over view of the treatment of deuteron spin as it is presented in  @xcite . in order to evaluate the cross section",
    ", we must determine how the operator , @xmath264 acts on the spin-1 ground state of the deuteron .",
    "the non - relativistic deuteron wave function in momentum space is written in terms of s and d states via the formula , @xmath265 | \\hat{q } , m \\rangle \\label{eq : pol1}\\ ] ] where , @xmath266 the real functions , @xmath267 and @xmath268 , are taken from any realistic model of the deuteron wave function , and in our computations we use the paris potential  @xcite .",
