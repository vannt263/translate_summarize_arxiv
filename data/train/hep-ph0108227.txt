    "the condition that @xmath14 be similarly large is necessary , but not sufficient , to allow reliable evaluation of the lhs using the ope .",

    "( [ dispersion ] ) and ( [ borel ] ) are @xmath47 , implies that the @xmath48 ( or @xmath49 ) pole contributions provide lower bounds to these integrals .",

    ", however , one must at present provide theoretical input for the higher resonance contributions .",
    "these contributions can not be expected to be negligible since the @xmath51 factors for all @xmath29 are formally of the same order in the chiral expansion .",
    "in fact , in existing analyses , the higher resonance contributions are typically larger than the @xmath48 ( or @xmath49 ) pole contributions  as an example , the @xmath37 and @xmath38 contributions to the @xmath52-weighted fesr used to determine @xmath2 in refs .",
    "@xcite are a factor of @xmath53 times the @xmath48 pole contribution .",
    "two approaches to constraining the higher resonance contributions exist in the literature . in the first",
    ", additional sum rules have been used to provide an estimate of the decay constant of the first excited resonance@xcite . in the second",
    ", resonance dominance has been assumed to be a good approximation , even in the @xmath54 ( or @xmath55 ) threshold region , and known chpt expressions for the threshold values of the spectral functions used to normalize sums - of - breit - wigner anstze for the higher resonance contributions .",
    "since the thresholds are typically several resonance widths ( or more ) removed from the resonance masses , the peak normalizations ( the features of the resonance contributions to which the sum rule determinations of the @xmath9 are dominantly sensitive ) will be ambiguous in this approach , depending , for example , on the treatment of the @xmath56-dependence of the `` off - shell width '' .",
    "potential dangers of this threshold normalization approach have been discussed in refs .",
    "the situation in the @xmath1 scalar channel , where the near - threshold behavior of the spectral function is significantly constrained by known @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59wave phase shifts , is particularly instructive . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the near - threshold spectral function implied , through unitarity , by the @xmath57 phases and the resulting omnes representation of the timelike scalar @xmath57 _ can not _ be well represented by the tail of a breit - wigner resonance form ; a significant background component , interfering constructively with the resonance contribution in the threshold region , is required .",
    "the near - threshold normalization of the resonance contribution is , therefore , significantly reduced , producing a corresponding reduction in the value of the spectral function at the @xmath60 resonance peak .",
    "this reduction is very significant numerically : the @xmath60 peak value of the @xmath1 scalar spectral function obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ( albeit with some additional assumptions about the high-@xmath56 behavior of the @xmath57 phase and the form of the omnes representation ) is a factor of @xmath61 smaller than that obtained , using the threshold - resonance - dominance assumption ( trda ) , in ref .",
    "even if one questions the additional assumptions which go into the precise numerical value of the reduction in this case , one should bear in mind that the trda ansatz for the @xmath1 scalar channel was shown to correspond to a value of the slope of the timelike @xmath57 form factor at threshold incompatible with that known from chpt  @xcite .",
    "further evidence of the potential problems of the trda approach are provided by the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",

    "@xcite for the @xmath0 pseudoscalar channel and of refs .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath1 scalar channel were tested using families of pfesr s in which the ope scales used were the same as those employed in the earlier analyses . _",
    "if _ the trda spectral ansatz for a given channel is a good representation of the physical spectral function in that channel , and if the scale of the original analysis was such that the ope representation could be reliably employed , then pfesr s constructed using the same spectral ansatz for the same correlator should also be well satisfied .",
    "it turns out that , in both the @xmath0 pseudoscalar and @xmath1 scalar channels , the trda ansatz produces a very poor match between the ope and spectral integral sides of the various pfesr s  @xcite . in contrast , the match corresponding to the @xmath1 scalar spectral function of ref .",
    "@xcite is quite reasonable  @xcite .    in view of the above observations ,",
    "we do not employ the trda ansatz for the excited pseudoscalar contributions , but instead constrain these contributions , in analogy to the treatment of the isovector vector and scalar channels in ref .",
    "@xcite    note that , in the isovector vector channel , if one ignores the experimental spectral data and instead uses the pfesr ope integrals to fit the decay constants of a spectral ansatz consisting of a sum of breit - wigner resonance contributions , one obtains a value of the @xmath62 decay constant in agreement with the experimental value to better than the experimental error  @xcite .",
    ", by analyzing simultaneously two continuous families of pfesr s , corresponding to the weights @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 . as we will show , the set of these constraints is sufficiently strong to allow determination of not only the excited resonance decay constants , but also the light quark mass combinations .",
    "the input required for this analysis is outlined briefly in the next section .",
    "our final results , together with a discussion of existing quark mass analyses , are provided in section iii while section iv contains our conclusions .",
    "the spectral ansatz for the @xmath0 pseudoscalar channel is @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the pdg2000  @xcite masses of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath68 are their ( as yet undetermined ) decay constants , and @xmath69 are the standard breit - wigner forms .",
    "we have employed pdg2000 values for all resonance widths . the corresponding expression for @xmath70 is obtained by the replacements @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in order that this ansatz provide a good representation of the spectrum over the whole range required in the pfesr spectral integrals , @xmath14 can not be taken much greater than @xmath74 ; if it is , an unphysical `` gap '' , with little spectral strength , will be present in the integration region .",
    "we therefore require @xmath14 to remain less than about @xmath75 . to create a good analysis window in @xmath14 without at the same time sacrificing good convergence of the integrated @xmath76 ope series",
    ", we also take @xmath77 .",
    "the ability to avoid unphysical spectral gaps represents a potential advantage of the pfesr framework over its bsr counterpart . for bsr s , the continuum threshold , @xmath14 ,",
    "is usually set by requiring an optimal stability window with respect to the borel mass , @xmath15 .",
    "taking the @xmath42 analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite as an example , and considering the case , @xmath78 , which most closely corresponds to the current experimental determination of @xmath79 , the stability window is optimized for @xmath14 between @xmath80 and @xmath81 gev@xmath82  @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectral ansatz , therefore , has a gap with very little spectral strength from about @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "it is also worth noting that , after borel transformation , the scale relevant to the running coupling in the ope is @xmath85 . for the correlators of interest to us",
    "the convergence of the transformed @xmath76 series becomes good only for @xmath86 greater than about @xmath87 .",
    "even if one is willing to tolerate a spectral gap by allowing @xmath88 , this means that @xmath89 will be @xmath90 over much of any putative stability window in @xmath15 .",
    "such a condition signals non - trivial contributions from the `` continuum '' region , where only a relatively crude approximation to the spectral function is being employed .",
    "this leaves only a small range of @xmath15 having both good ope convergence and acceptably small continuum contributions ( say less than @xmath91 of the @xmath76 ope term ) . with such a small range of @xmath15 ,",
    "the bsr constraints are not sufficiently strong to allow a simultaneous determination of the quark masses and excited resonance decay constants . in the case of pfesr s ,",
    "empirical evidence from the isovector vector channel suggests that contributions analogous to the less reliable continuum bsr contributions ( _ i.e. _ , those contributions from the region of the contour @xmath92 near the timelike real axis , where the ope is expected to break down ) are strongly suppressed by the restriction to weights satisfying @xmath26 .    on the ope side of the sum rules",
    ", one must bear in mind that , in scalar and pseudoscalar channels , potentially important contributions from direct instantons exist which are not incorporated in the standard ope representation of @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "such contributions are , in fact , needed to produce a borel transform , @xmath93(m^2)$ ] , which behaves correctly ( i.e. , is independent of @xmath15 ) in the chiral limit@xcite . the instanton liquid model ( ilm )  @xcite provides a tractable framework for estimating such contributions . in the ilm , an average density ( related to the value of the gluon condensate ) and fixed average size are employed for the instanton distribution .",
    "phenomenological constraints require the average instanton size , @xmath94 to be @xmath95@xcite .",
    "instanton contributions to @xmath96(m^2)$ ] then exceed one - loop perturbative contributions below @xmath97 , but drop to less than @xmath98 of this contribution for @xmath99  @xcite .",
    "the combination of 2- , 3- and 4-loop contributions roughly doubles the borel transformed 1-loop @xmath76 contribution at @xmath100 , hence further suppressing the ratio of ilm to perturbative contributions .",
    "direct instanton contributions have been neglected in recent treatments of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 pseudoscalar channels , apart from the bsr @xmath0 analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite , both of which employed the ilm .",
    "the numerical impact of the neglect of these contributions should be small for bsr analyses at scales @xmath101 since the borel transform is known to rather strongly suppress ilm contributions with increasing scale    for example , the bound obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is raised by @xmath102 if ilm contributions are turned off  @xcite .    .",
    "this is , however , _ not _ true of fesr analyses , for which ilm contributions fall off , relative to the @xmath76 perturbative contributions , much more slowly with increasing @xmath14 .    in what follows",
    ", we will use the ilm to estimate direct instanton contributions to the @xmath103 and @xmath104 pfesr s .",
    "ilm contributions to pfesr s corresponding to polynomial weights can be evaluated using the result  @xcite @xmath105_{ilm } = { \\frac{-3\\eta_{ij}}{4\\pi}}\\ , \\int_0^{s_0 } ds\\ , s^{k+1}j_1\\left ( \\rho_i\\sqrt{s}\\right ) y_1\\left(\\rho_i\\sqrt{s}\\right)\\ , \\label{fesrinstanton}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 , @xmath107 is an @xmath108-breaking factor whose value in the ilm is @xmath109  @xcite , and the result is relevant to scales @xmath110 .",
    "one should bear in mind that phenomenological support for the ilm exists primarily for those scales ( @xmath110 ) where instanton contributions are numerically important in pseudoscalar bsr s , and that this scale is significantly lower than that ( @xmath111 ) relevant to our pfesr analysis .",
    "it is , therefore , useful to have an independent test of our use of the ilm representation of instanton effects . in this regard",
    ", one can take advantage of the much stronger suppression of ilm contributions in the bsr framework .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "one first determines the excited meson decay constants for the channel of interest , using the pfesr framework .",
    "these values then determine the @xmath112 part of the spectral ansatz for a bsr treatment of the same channel .",
    "( the spectral function for @xmath113 is , as usual , approximated using the continuum ansatz ; we fix the continuum threshold , @xmath14 , following standard practice , by optimizing the stability of the output , in this case , the quark mass combination , @xmath9 , with respect to @xmath86 . ) for @xmath99 , where ( 1 ) convergence of the borel transformed @xmath76 series is still reasonable and ( 2 ) continuum contributions are still relatively small ( not yet exceeding @xmath91 of perturbative contributions ) , the resulting bsr should then allow determination of the only remaining unknown , @xmath9 , with good accuracy .",
    "the ilm contributions play little role on the ope+ilm side of the bsr s at these scales , but are important for the pfesr s , and hence for the values of the resonance decay constants used as input to the bsr s .",
    "if the ilm representation of direct instanton effects is reasonable at the scale of the pfesr analysis , the pfesr and bsr determinations of @xmath9 , which will then have been obtained using the same excited resonance decay constants , should be compatible within their mutual errors .",
    "since the continuum approximation for the spectral function is a relatively crude one , and the stability criterion for choosing @xmath14 typically leaves a gap in the bsr spectral model , there are uncertainties in the bsr analysis beyond those associated with the uncertainties in the ope input , which are shared by the pfesr and bsr analyses . in order to get a rough estimate of these additional uncertainties we allow @xmath14 to vary in an interval of size @xmath114 ,",
    "i.e. , by @xmath115 about the value corresponding to optimal stability , and assign a @xmath116 error to the size of continuum spectral contributions .",
    "since the @xmath14 values we obtain are @xmath117 , we consider the latter estimate sufficiently conservative    for the analogous cases of the @xmath0 vector and axial vector channels , where the hadronic spectral functions are known experimentally from hadronic @xmath4 decay data , the _ maximum _ deviation of the actual spectral function from its 4-loop ope continuum approximation is less than @xmath118 of the ope version in the interval @xmath119  @xcite .",
    "note that these scales are smaller than those for which we will be employing the continuum approximation , and that we are concerned with the _ average _ , rather than maximum , deviation in the range @xmath113 .    .",

    ", one should bear in mind that the result quoted by dps , @xmath289 corresponds to ( 1 ) an average of the values obtained using @xmath290 and @xmath291 , ( 2 ) an average over values associated with a range of @xmath14 , and ( 3 ) neglect of @xmath292 in the ope prefactor    restoring @xmath292 to the prefactor , using chpt values for the quark mass ratios , and converting to the scale @xmath293 gev , the dps result becomes @xmath294 .    .",
    "since the choice @xmath290 is not consistent with the aleph determination of @xmath295 , we restrict our attention to the dps results obtained using @xmath167 , which corresponds very closely to the central aleph determination .",
    "restoring @xmath292 in the overall ope prefactor , and reading off from fig .  2 of dps , concentrating on the curve corresponding to @xmath296 , which displays the best stability of @xmath154 with respect to @xmath86 ,",
    "the central dps bsr determination becomes @xmath297 .",
    "since the details of the spectral ansatz employed are not fully specified in dps , we are unable to quote errors equivalent to those of our bsr analyses above .",
    "if , however , we fix the ratio of decay constants in such a way as to ensure exact equality of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 contributions to the spectral function at physical threshold , and neglect ilm contributions , as in dps , we find that , after performing our usual pfesr analysis , the resulting spectral ansatz , run through a bsr analysis with @xmath296 , reproduces the dps central value exactly .",
    "estimating our bsr errors as for the analyses above , we then have , for our dps - like bsr determination , @xmath298 the pfesr ope / spectral integral match corresponding to this bsr determination is reasonable ( see fig .",
    "[ dpsnoilmn ] for the @xmath103 family case ; the fit quality for the @xmath104 family is not shown , but is better than for the @xmath103 family ) .",
    "the central no - ilm pfesr @xmath154 value , @xmath299 however , is again inconsistent with the corresponding bsr value . the situation is not improved by including ilm contributions : re - doing the pfesr analysis , still with the constrained form of the spectral ansatz , but now incorporating ilm contributions on the theoretical side , one finds a poor quality optimized ope+ilm / spectral integral match .",
    "we conclude this section with a reminder of the values obtained for @xmath154 via sum rule analyses of other channels .",
    "recent treatments of the correlator of @xmath300  @xcite , for which the low-@xmath56 part of the spectral function is constrained by @xmath57 phases , yield values of @xmath233 in the range @xmath301 , compatible with either the ilm or no - ilm results above .",
    "assumptions about the form of the omnes representation of the timelike scalar @xmath57 form factor , and the behavior of the @xmath57 phase in the region @xmath302 , where experimental phase data does not exist , however , enter the construction of the spectral function used in those analyses , so that a significant theoretical systematic error is present , in addition to the errors quoted in refs .",
    "@xcite . a much cleaner approach , in principle , is the extraction of @xmath154 via pfesr analyses of the flavor - breaking difference of @xmath0 and @xmath1 vector - plus - axial - vector correlator sums .",
    "the hadronic spectral function required in this case is measurable in hadronic @xmath4 decay .",
    "there are two basic complications , first , that the ope representation of the longitudinal contribution to the @xmath4 hadronic decay width is very badly behaved at those scales which are kinematically allowed  @xcite and , second , that , because of the rather strong cancellation in the @xmath0-@xmath1 spectral difference , the extracted value of @xmath154 is quite sensitive to even @xmath303 uncertainties in the value of @xmath304 .",
    "the first problem can be handled by appropriate weight choices  @xcite .",
    "the second is numerically relevant because the central values of the determinations of @xmath304 based on ( 1 ) experimental @xmath305 data , @xmath306 and ( 2 ) ckm unitarity , in combination with the experimental value of @xmath307 , @xmath308    the central value and `` errors '' quoted here correspond to the mid - point and extent of the pdg2000 unitarity - constrained fit range .    , while consistent within errors , differ by @xmath309 .",
    "there has also been some confusion in the literature resulting from the use , in the various recent theoretical analyses , of three different sets of values for the weighted @xmath0-@xmath1 spectral differences , corresponding to three different values of @xmath310 , the total ( @xmath311 ) branching fraction into strange hadronic states    these three values , which are in the ratios @xmath312 correspond to ( 1 ) the preliminary ( 1998 ) aleph analysis of strange decay modes  @xcite , ( 2 ) the final ( 1999 ) version of this analysis  @xcite , and ( 3 ) the recent update ( 2000 ) reported by davier  @xcite .",
    "larger values of @xmath310 correspond to smaller values of the @xmath0-@xmath1 difference , and hence to lower values of @xmath154 .    .",
    "the strong @xmath0-@xmath1 cancellation makes the extracted value of @xmath154 quite sensitive to the ( apparently rather small ) differences between these @xmath310 values .",
    "the discrepancies between the various values of @xmath154 reported in the literature , all of which are nominally based on the `` same '' ( aleph ) @xmath4 decay data , turn out to be almost entirely a reflection of this sensitivity .",
    "the situation is discussed in some detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the various analyses have also been updated to reflect the current experimental situation ( as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . once common input is employed , all hadronic @xmath4 determinations of @xmath154 are in excellent agreement  @xcite .",
    "the dominant uncertainty remains that associated with @xmath304 .",
    "using central values of @xmath307 and @xmath304 corresponding to either ( 1 ) the pdg2000 best independent individual determinations ( ckmn ) ( @xmath313 and @xmath314 ) or ( 2 ) the pdg2000 unitarity - constrained fit ( ckmu ) ( @xmath315 and @xmath316 ) , one obtains @xmath317 and @xmath318 respectively  @xcite .",
    "either of these results is compatible with that obtained from the pseudoscalar channel analyses above .",
    "we have determined @xmath2 , @xmath154 , and the decay constants of the @xmath37 and @xmath40 with good accuracy from a combined pfesr / bsr study of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 pseudoscalar correlators .",
    "our results show that it is important to require the consistency of the two different sum rule approaches .",
    "indeed , we have seen that there exist anstze for the hadronic spectral functions which produce both extremely good bsr stability plateaus and high - quality pfesr ope(+ilm)/spectral integral matches , but for which the output quark mass combinations are inconsistent .",
    "this means that bsr or pfesr treatments , by themselves , do not provide sufficiently strong constraints to allow one to simultaneously constrain the unknown quark masses , unknown resonance decay constants and the theoretical modelling of direct instanton effects .",
    "the combination of the two approaches does , however , provide sufficiently strong constraints .",
    "the consistency of the combined analysis is particularly compelling for the @xmath0 case .",
    "the values obtained for the light quark masses are in excellent agreement with determinations from other sources , giving us further confidence in the reliability of the combined analysis .",
    "the corresponding determinations of the @xmath37 and @xmath40 decay constants are accurate to @xmath244 and @xmath319 respectively .",
    "the latter determination is relevant to future improvements in the extraction of @xmath154 from hadronic @xmath4 decay data . while b factory data will dramatically reduce the errors on the experimental @xmath1 vector - plus - axial - vector @xmath4 decay distribution , the ability to use this improvement to significantly reduce the errors on the corresponding determination of @xmath154 will depend on one s ability to work with pfesr s involving weights for which the @xmath0-@xmath1 cancellation is significantly reduced , so that the errors resulting from the uncertainty in @xmath304 will , as a result , play a significantly reduced role .",
    "the existence of significant theoretical systematic uncertainties in versions of this analysis which include longitudinal ope contributions  @xcite means that `` non - inclusive '' analyses ( involving only the sum of spin @xmath320 and @xmath45 correlator components ) will eventually be required .",
    "a knowledge of the decay constants of the excited strange pseudoscalar and scalar resonances allows a straightforward subtraction of the longitudinal contributions to the experimental distributions . in the absence of an experimental spin separation , sum rule determinations of the strange scalar and pseudoscalar resonance decay constants with an accuracy even a factor of three worse than that obtained above for the @xmath40 are already extremely useful as input for such non - inclusive analyses .",
