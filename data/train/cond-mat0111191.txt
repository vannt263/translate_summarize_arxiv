    "the spontaneous formation of traffic jams on highways has attracted attention for the last years because of two reasons .",
    "the former is the importance of this problem for traffic engineering especially concerning the feasibility of attaining the limit capacity of traffic networks and quantifying it .",
    "the latter is a fact that the jam formation nicely exemplifies the existence of various phase states and transitions between them in statistical systems comprising elements with motivated behavior , which is a novel branch of physics . according to the modern notion proposed by kerner ( see , e.g. ref .  )",
    "based on the experimental data @xcite the jam formation is of sufficiently complex nature . in particular , it proceeds mainly through the sequence of two phase transitions : free flow ( f ) @xmath0 synchronized mode ( s ) @xmath0 stop - and - go pattern ( j ) @xcite .",
    "both of these transitions are of the first order , i.e. they exhibit breakdown , hysteresis , and nucleation effects @xcite .",
    "the f@xmath1j transition can occur directly if only the synchronized mode is suppressed by a road heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "the recent analysis of single - vehicle data by neubert _",
    "@xcite , in particular , conformed these features and also discovered fundamental microscopic properties distinguishing the synchronized mode from the other traffic states .",
    "theoretical description of the jam formation is far from being developed well because the synchronized mode possesses extremely complex structure @xcite .",
    "for example , it comprises a certain continuum of quasistable states , so , matches a whole two - dimensional region on the phase plane `` vehicle density    traffic volume '' in contrast to the free flow state .",
    "however , tackling the question of how to regulate traffic flow on highways , for example , by controlling the speed limitation in order to prevent the jam formation we may rough out the problem . indeed ,",
    "for this purpose it is sufficient to analyze the conditions giving rise to jams rather then the jam evolution itself .",
    "such a standpoint is justified , in part , by the aforementioned phase transitions being of the first order .",
    "the free flow state , presumably , should have the feasibility to exist at the given car density or inside its certain neighborhood .",
    "this might be the necessary requirement for jam formation at a fixed vehicle density , or for appearance of both the jam phase and the synchronized mode at a fixed traffic volume .",
    "second , the jam formation proceeds via the nucleation mechanism but not in a regular manner .",
    "therefore , the key point in the emergence of a jam is the random occurrence of its critical nucleus inside the synchronized mode or free flow .",
    "the jam formation manifests itself in the traffic breakdown , i.e. in a sharp drop of the traffic volume to a substantially lower value .",
    "detecting these events one can get the rate of the critical nucleus generation depending on the road conditions and the traffic state . in this way the main attention is shifted to the experimental and theoretical analysis of the probabilistic features of jam formation regarding the characteristic mean values of the traffic volume as phenomenological parameters @xcite .",
    "such a probabilistic description of the traffic breakdown is the main purpose of the present paper .    at the first glance the problem seems hopeless until the model of the synchronized mode",
    "is developed .",
    "nevertheless , there are circumstances enabling us to make a step towards this problem right now ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "the matter is that the f@xmath2s transition is of another nature than the s@xmath2j transition .",
    "the former is due to a sharp decrease in the overtaking frequency , giving rise to the synchronized mode , whereas the latter is caused by the pinch effect ( see , e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "thereby the main case of the f@xmath2s transition is not fluctuations in the vehicle density and velocity but in other characteristic parameters of the traffic flow ( cf . also ref .  ) .",
    "by contrast , just these fluctuations give rise to the jam emergence in the synchronized traffic flow . as a result ,",
    "the threshold of the f@xmath3s transition turns out to be remarkably less than that of the jam formation and attained at lower values of the vehicle density .",
    "so , the generation rate of critical nuclei for the former transition has to be great in comparison with the latter one .",
    "thus , on time scales characterizing the occurrence of the jam critical nuclei the traffic state with respect to the transitions between the free flow and synchronized mode is quasistationary .",
    "therefore the formation of a jam critical nucleus is the leading nonequilibrium process limiting the traffic breakdown .",
    "the latter feature allows us to confine our consideration solely to the jam nucleus generation and to regard the synchronized mode and the free flow phase ( if they coexist in the case under consideration ) as one traffic state .",
    "moreover , since a jam forms actually inside the synchronized mode where the vehicle motion at different lane is strongly correlated we may apply to a single - lane road approximation that treats all the cars moving at different lanes on a multilane highway and being neighboring across the highway as a single effective macrovehicle consisting of many cars .",
    "the macrovehicle concept is partly justified by the empirically observed fact that fluctuations in the downstream flow leaving a freeway bottleneck can proceed without the traffic state change even their amplitude attains 30% of the mean traffic volume @xcite . in any case fluctuations in the traffic flow volume near its breakdown",
    "are of macroscopic nature and the critical nucleus of traffic jam has to include many vehicles .",
    "this feature is also pointed to by the observed breakdown near a ramp - on occurring each time after a large vehicle cluster entered the freeway stream @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out the real structure of congested traffic near a highway bottleneck is sufficiently complex , it contains the region of synchronized mode located in the close proximity of the bottleneck , the preceding upstream region of moving narrow jams transformed into wide jams @xcite .",
    "however it is quite reasonable to consider this structure as being induced by the traffic breakdown processes arising inside the `` head '' of this complex jam , in the region of synchronized mode adjacent the bottleneck . therefore the main characteristics of the breakdown phenomenon may be related to intrinsic processes taking place inside the synchronized mode on not to large spatial scales .",
    "the latter justifies our attempt to describe traffic breakdown ignoring the complex spatial structure of the metastable traffic state inside which critical jam nuclei originate .",
    "processes similar to the traffic breakdown are widely met in physical systems .",
    "for example , water condensation in supersaturated vapor proceeds via formation of small atom clusters of critical size . keeping in mind this analogy between the traffic breakdown and the phase transitions in physical systems mahnke _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a kinetic approach based on the stochastic master equation describing the jam formation in terms of the attachment of individual cars to their cluster .",
    "however , the particular form of the developed master equation does not allow for the jam formation being the first order phase transition and , thus , the traffic breakdown . in the present paper",
    "we generalize this kinetic approach to describe the latter phenomenon .    ]    however , before passing directly to the model statement we recall the experimental data enabling us to estimate the characteristic size @xmath4 of vehicle clusters that are small enough so the behavior of drivers inside them seems to be special . from our point of view",
    "the multilane correlations in the vehicle motion are due to the drivers taking into account the behavior of all the cars , including also the cars at the neighboring lanes , that are inside the region accessible to observation .",
    "therefore the synchronized mode has to exhibit strong correlations in this region .",
    "figure  [ svd ] shows the speed autocorrelation function _ vs _ the number of cars passed a fixed detector that was experimentally found in the synchronized mode @xcite ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "we see that the car velocities are strongly correlated over scales spanning some ten vehicles , i.e. a car cluster of this size , @xmath5 , makes up actually a certain fundamental unit of the synchronized mode . in the free flow",
    "no such long - distant correlations have been observed .",
    "we consider traffic flow on a single - lane road and study the spontaneous formation of a jam regarded as a large car vehicle cluster arising on the road . instead of dealing with a certain road part of length @xmath6 and imposing some boundary conditions at its entries and exits",
    "we examine a circular road of length @xmath6 with @xmath7 cars moving on it .",
    "all the cars are assumed to be identical vehicles of length @xmath8 and can make up two phases .",
    "one of them is the set of `` freely '' moving cars and the other is a single cluster .",
    "the cluster is specified by its size @xmath9 , the number of aggregated cars .",
    "its internal parameters , namely , the headway distance @xmath10 ( i.e. the distance between the front bumper of a chosen car and the back bumper of the following one ) and , consequently , the velocity @xmath11 of cars in the cluster are treated as fixed values independent of the cluster size @xmath9 .",
    "we note that in the model under consideration there can be only one cluster on the road .",
    "the `` free '' flow phase is also specified by the corresponding headway distance @xmath12 which , however , already depends on the car cluster size @xmath9 because the larger is the cluster , the less is the number ( @xmath13 ) of the `` freely '' moving cars and , so , the longer is the headway distance @xmath12 .    ]    when a cluster arises on the road its further growth is due to the attachment of the `` free '' cars to its upstream boundary , whereas the cars located near its downstream boundary accelerating leave it , which decreases the cluster size .",
    "these processes are treated as random changes of the cluster size @xmath9 by @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ me ] ) and the cluster evolution is described in terms of time variations of the probability function @xmath15 for the cluster to be of size @xmath9 at time @xmath16 . then following mahnke _",
    "@xcite we write the following master equation governing the cluster growth @xmath17 \\mathcal{p}(n , t)\\,,\\label{e.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the cluster size @xmath9 meets the inequality @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the transition rates illustrated in fig .",
    "[ me ] and depending generally on the cluster size @xmath9 .",
    "the formation and dissolution of the maximum possible cluster containing all the cars is described by the equation @xmath21 whereas the emergence of the jam seed , the cluster consisting of one car called below precluster , obeys the equation @xmath22 here the function @xmath23 is the probability of no cluster on the road . at the initial time @xmath24 no cluster is assumed to be on the road : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is kronecker s symbol .",
    "the system of equations  ( [ e.1])([e.3 ] ) subject to the initial condition  ( [ e.i ] ) makes up the probabilistic description of the cluster formation .",
    "special attention should be paid to the question as to what the precluster is .",
    "the model proposes the following .",
    "when there is no cluster on the road , i.e. all the cars move `` freely '' the velocity of one of them can randomly drop down to the velocity @xmath11 in the cluster .",
    "such a car is regarded as the precluster , a size - one cluster . when a precluster has arisen",
    "its further evolution follows the scheme shown in fig .",
    "the precluster concept may be justified by recalling the problem we deal with initially , i.e. the breakdown processes in multilane traffic flow .",
    "the cars under consideration actually match small vehicle clusters of the synchronized mode , macrovehicle , arising in traffic flow on a multilane highway and comprised of real vehicles moving synchronously at different lanes .",
    "therefore the precluster is actually as a certain sufficiently small cluster of the synchronized mode . keeping in mind the relatively low threshold of the f@xmath2s transition",
    "we will assume the precluster generation as well as the precluster dissipation to be intensive processes so that the `` free '' flow phase , @xmath27 , and the precluster state , @xmath28 , come into quasi - equilibrium on time scales needed for the critical cluster nucleus to arise .",
    "in particular , in no case the precluster emergence limits the cluster evolution , so , the particular details of the precluster formation has no substantial effect on the traffic breakdown .    at the next step",

    "the breakdown phenomenon was investigated in traffic flow near two bottlenecks of highway  401 , one of the primary toronto traffic arteries .",
    "the detectors were located right after the on - ramps within several hundred meters downstream .",

    "we have considered the traffic breakdown phenomenon regarded as a random process developing via the nucleation mechanism .",
    "the origin of critical jam nuclei proceeds in a metastable phase of traffic flow and seems to be located inside a not too large region on a highway , for example , in the close proximity of a highway bottleneck @xcite .",
    "the induced complex structure of the congested traffic phase is located upstream the bottleneck @xcite . keeping these properties in mind",
    "we have applied to the probabilistic model regarding the jam emergence as the development of a large car cluster on highway . in these terms",
    "the traffic breakdown proceeds through the formation of a certain car of critical size in the metastable vehicle flow , which enabled us to confine ourselves to the single cluster model .",
    "we assumed that , first , the growth of the car cluster is governed by attachment of cars to the cluster whose rate is mainly determined by the mean headway distance between the cars in the vehicle flow and , may be , also by the headway distance in the cluster .",
    "second , the cluster dissolution is determined by the car escape from the cluster whose rate depends on the cluster size directly . to justify the latter assumption we apply to the modern notion of the traffic flow structure ( see ref .  ) .",
    "namely , the jam emergence goes mainly through the sequence of two phase transitions : free flow @xmath0 synchronized mode @xmath0 stop - and - go pattern @xcite .",
    "both of these transitions are of the first order , i.e. they exhibit breakdown , hysteresis , and nucleation effects @xcite . therefore considering the final stage of the jam emergence we have to regard the synchronized mode as the metastable phase exactly inside which a critical jam nucleus appears due to random fluctuations .",
    "the synchronized mode is characterized by strong multilane correlations in the car motion and , as a result , all the vehicles in a certain affective cluster spanning over all the highway lanes move as a whole .",
    "so the proposed probabilistic description deals with actually macrovehicles comprising many individual cars .",
    "the available single - vehicle experimental data @xcite present the correlation characteristics of the synchronized mode which have enabled us to estimate the characteristic dimension @xmath21330 of the car cluster entering the dependence of the car detachment rate on the cluster size .",
    "namely for small car clusters , @xmath126 , the characteristic detachment time @xmath72 should be substantially less than this time @xmath239 for large clusters , @xmath65 .",
    "we have written the appropriate master equation for the cluster distribution function and analyze the formation of the critical car cluster due to the climb over a certain potential barrier .",
    "the inequality @xmath240 has opened us the way to convert from the discrete master equation to the appropriate fokker - plank equation and find all the required characteristics of the traffic breakdown .",
    "the obtained results are compared with the available experimental data and , in detail , with the probability of traffic breakdown in the vicinity of bottlenecks _ vs _ the traffic volume presented by lorenz & elefteriadou @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the theoretical curves can be fitted closely to the given experimental data using values of the main parameters chosen based on the general properties of the traffic flow not related directly to the breakdown dynamics .",
    "in particular , first , we have demonstrated that the characteristic internal time scale @xmath216 of the breakdown development is about @xmath241 ( we recall that @xmath202  sec is the characteristic time during which a car can individually leave a cluster ) .",
    "whence we get the estimate of the breakdown timescale about one minute .",
    "the latter justifies the widely used probabilistic technique of the breakdown investigation based on fixing this event during a time interval of several minutes .",
    "second , the proposed model explains why the traffic breakdown as a probabilistic phenomenon is observed inside a sufficiently wide interval of the traffic volume , namely , the thickness @xmath242 of this layer can attain its low boundary @xmath243 in magnitude .",
    "the matter is that @xmath244 .    concluding the aforesaid we state that traffic breakdown is a mesoscopic process , as it must be for the synchronized mode",
    ", whose characteristic spatial and temporal scales correspond to car clusters made of a large number of vehicles .",
    "the authors would like to thank peter wagner ( berlin ) for useful comments and criticism .",
    "in section  [ sec : fpe ] we have obtained the fokker - plank equation  ( [ e.fp ] ) governing the evolution of car clusters treated as random wandering in the space of their size @xmath9 .",
    "it has turned out that near the threshold the precluster domain is separated from the large cluster region by a potential barrier @xmath179 , so , the formation of the clustered phase should proceeds through the nucleation mechanism ( fig .",
    "[ 2in1 ] ) . in other words , for a large cluster to emerge on the road its critical nucleus @xmath127 has to arise via random fluctuations of the cluster size in the precluster region .",
    "thereby in order to describe the cluster formation we need the expression specifying the rate of the critical nucleus generation , being the subject of the present appendix .",
    "mathematically the description of the critical nucleus generation is equivalent to the problem of a particle escaping form the corresponding potential barrier ( fig .",
    "[ f : pb ] ) .",
    "thereby the rate of the critical nucleus generation , i.e. the frequency of the traffic breakdown @xmath245 is represented in terms of the probability density @xmath246 for this particle to escape from the potential well at a given time @xmath16 provided initially , @xmath24 , it has been placed near the local minimum ( here @xmath27 ) .",
    "namely @xmath247 where the value @xmath248 of the argument @xmath16 means that we consider time scales exceeding substantially the duration of all the transient processes during which the distribution of the particle inside the potential well attains locally quasi - equilibrium .",
    "since the potential relief under consideration is rather special we prefer to recall briefly the way of deriving the probability @xmath246 referring a reader to the specific literature ( see , e.g. , book  @xcite ) for details .",
    "the concept of potential well implies that the barrier is sufficiently high , @xmath249 , therefore the particle can climb over it due to rare fluctuations lifting the particle to points at the potential barrier where @xmath250 .",
    "if such an event does not lead to escape the particle will drift back to the the neighborhood of the local minimum @xmath27 whose thickness is specified by the inequality @xmath251 .",
    "thereby the subsequent attempts of escaping may be considered as being mutually independent .",
    "after the particle has climbed over the barrier the force @xmath142 carries it away to distant points , making the return impossible .",
    "so from this point of view we may refer to the particle being inside the potential well or having escaped from it as two its possible states without specifying the particular position .",
    "therefore the probability @xmath252 that the particle remains inside the well at time @xmath16 if it has being placed in it at time @xmath253 obeys the equation : @xmath254 whence we get the general expression for the function @xmath255 @xmath256 where @xmath257 is a certain constant specified by the particular properties of a potential well .",
    "the latter formula gives us immediately the general form of the escape probability @xmath258    in order to find the lifetime @xmath257 we will deal with the laplace transform @xmath259 of the escape probability @xmath246 @xmath260 whence it follows that in the expansion of @xmath259 with respect to @xmath261 around the point @xmath262 @xmath263 the first order term directly contains the desired lifetime as the coefficient .",
    "following the standard approach @xcite we reduce the escaping problem to finding the first passage time probability .",
    "in other words , we assume the particle never to come back to the potential well if it after climbing the barrier reaches points where @xmath264 ( fig .",
    "[ f : pb ] ) . the particle may be withdrawn from the consideration or , what is the same , it will be trapped when reaches for the first time any fixed point @xmath265 in this region .",
    "the time it takes for the particle to reach the point @xmath265 after overcoming the barrier at the critical point @xmath127 is ignorable in comparison with the characteristic wait of critical fluctuations . thereby the function @xmath246 specifies actually the probability of passing ( reaching ) the point @xmath265 for the first time at the time moment @xmath16 .",
    "this construction enables us to introduce a more detailed relative function @xmath266 giving the probability for the particle initially placed at the point @xmath267 to reach first the right boundary @xmath265 of the region under consideration at the time moment @xmath16 .",
