    "in recent years , materials with complex structure are widely used in engineering devices in many fields of science .",
    "it is known that some properties of materials are controlled by their geometrical structure .",
    "therefore , the study of the influence of the material microstructure can improve its useful properties and reduce undesirable effects",
    ". the main methods for this study are asymptotic methods for boundary value problems ( bvp s ) in domains with complex structure : perforated domains , grid - domains , domains with rapidly oscillating boundaries , thick junctions , etc .    in this paper , we begin to study asymptotic properties of solutions to bvp s in thick junctions of a new type , namely _ thick fractal junctions_. a thick fractal junction is the union of some domain , which is called the junction s body , and a lot of joined thin trees situated @xmath2-periodically along some manifold on the boundary of the junction s body .",
    "the trees have finite number of branching levels .",
    "the small parameter @xmath13 characterizes the distance between neighboring thin branches and also their thickness . on fig .",
    "[ f1 ] you can see a heat radiator with a fractal - structure that has one branching level .",
    "various constructions of thick junction type are successfully used in nanotechnologies @xcite , microtechnique @xcite , modern engineering constructions ( microstrip radiator , ferrite - filled rod radiator ) , as well as many physical and biological systems .",
    "for example , a number of new applications are envisioned , especially regarding efficient sensors ( inertial , biological , chemical ) , signal processing filters ( ultra large band ) , micro - fractal constructions : fractal antennas , fractal transistors , fractal heat radiators and so on .    such successful applications of thick - junction constructions have stimulated active learning bvp s in thick junctions with more complex structures : thick junctions with the thin junction s body @xcite , thick multi - level junctions @xcite , thick cascade junctions @xcite , where new qualitative results were obtained . specifically , it was shown that processes in thick multi - level junctions behave as a `` many - phase system '' and thick cascade junctions have new kind of eigenvibrations .",
    "this means that materials with such micro - structures have some new properties .    designing such arrays of mechanical components in thick junctions",
    "can not be achieved with today softwares , because this would require too much cpu resources .",
    "regarding their number of components ( in some cases few thousands ) , development of new mathematical tools are necessary .",
    "one of them is asymptotic analysis of bvp s in thick junctions as @xmath14 i.e. , when the number of attached thin domains infinitely increases and their thickness decreases to zero .",
    "asymptotic results give us the possibility to replace the original problem in a thick junction by the corresponding homogenized problem that is more simpler and then apply computer simulation .",
    "in addition , in some cases it is possible to construct accurate and numerically implementable asymptotic approximations .    as a first step , here we consider a nonlinear boundary - value problem for a reaction - diffusion equation in a model @xmath15 thick fractal junction @xmath16 ( see fig  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "of course , it is possible to consider a thick fractal junction that has more complex branching structures .",
    "however , the main features in the asymptotic behavior of solutions to bvp s in thick fractal junctions can be observed on the example of @xmath16 ( a thick fractal junction with two branching levels ) .",

    "the availability of an uniformly bounded family of extension operators is typical supposition in overwhelming majority of the existing homogenization schemes for problems in perforated domains with the neumann or robin boundary conditions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , thick junctions are non - convex domains with non - smooth boundaries .",

    "asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the reaction - diffusion equation in different kind of thin domains with the uniform neumann conditions was studied in @xcite .",
    "the convergence theorems were proved under the following assumptions for the nonlinear term : + in @xcite it is a @xmath127-function with bounded derivatives and @xmath128 in @xcite it is a @xmath129-function , the dissipative condition ( [ disip - cond ] ) holds and @xmath130 ) can be proved under more weak assumptions for the functions @xmath131 namely they are vanish at zero and satisfy inequality ( [ deriv - cond ] ) .",
    "the nonlinear robin boundary conditions are considered on the boundaries of the thin branches .",
    "these conditions mean that there is a flux of a quantity through the surfaces of the branches .",
    "in fact very small activity holds always on the surface of some material ( therefore the robin boundary conditions are more natural for applied mathematical problems ) .",
    "such semilinear boundary conditions arise in many applied problems , in particular , in the modeling of chemical reactive flows .",
    "for instance , the following function @xmath132 which satisfies condition ( [ cond-2 ] ) if @xmath133 and @xmath134 corresponds to the michaelis - menten hypothesis in biochemical reactions and to the langmuir kinetics adsorption models ( see @xcite ) . 6 .   in the interpretation",
