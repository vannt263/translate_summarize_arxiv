    "we note that the dent seen in the eastern part of the shell is likely caused by the interaction between the snr and the molecular cloud . on the other hand",
    ", the elongation towards the south may be caused by the expansion of the shell into a relatively lower density medium void of the molecular cloud .",
    "the position of the gev emission is on the western part , and although the position error is large , there is no overlap between the gev source and the molecular cloud plus x - ray emission to its east @xcite .      here , we present our spatially resolved spectroscopic study of the diffuse emission below 10  kev with xis .",
    "we divided the remnant into two parts ( north and south ) and selected a nearby background region , as shown in figure  [ fig : xrayimage ] .",
    "the simplest way for the background estimation in the source regions is to subtract the spectrum extracted from the background region , but this sometimes introduces an uncertainty due to vignetting .",
    "we thus reproduce the background spectrum in the source region as described next .",
    "the background emission contains the non - x - ray background ( nxb ) , plus the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) , and emission from the local hot bubble ( lhb ) .",
    "the first component is uniform in the field of view , whereas the others are affected by vignetting .",
    "the nxb in the background region is generated by xisnxbgen @xcite , and was subtracted from the spectrum after adjusting the normalization above 10  kev , where we expect no emission except for the nxb .",
    "the nxb - subtracted spectra is shown in figure  [ fig : background - spec ] .",
    "we fit it with an absorbed cxb + grxe + lhb model . to reproduce the cxb emission , we assumed the power - law shape with a photon index of 1.4 , and the surface brightness in the 210  kev band of 5.4@xmath12  erg  s@xmath11@xmath13arcmin@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "note that the background region has an area of 73.7  arcmin@xmath15 .",
    "the hydrogen column density of the cxb in this direction was fixed to @xmath16  @xmath13 , as determined by h@xmath17 observations @xcite .",
    "we also added an absorbed thermal @xmath18 component for the emission from the lhb @xcite , and an absorbed two - temperature @xmath18 component for the grxe emission ( for example , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the best - fit model and parameters are shown in figure  [ fig : background - spec ] and table  [ tab : background - spec ] , respectively .",
    "the best - fit parameters are roughly consistent with the known components in other regions @xcite .    assuming that the background spectrum has the same shape and surface - brightness in the background and nearby source regions , we simulate the background spectrum in addition to the nxb spectrum in the source region , using the fakeit command in xspec .",
    "we assumed a similar exposure for the simulated background as for the source spectra .",
    "this is a similar method to what s described in @xcite .",
    "we then use this background spectrum in the following analysis .",
    "we initially perform the spectral analysis of the global snr using the total emission detected with @xmath19 from the snr ( i.e. the north+south regions shown in fig .  1 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : diffuse_spectra ] shows the background - subtracted spectra for the total emission .",
    "the spectrum shows emission lines from highly ionized ne , mg , and si , implying that the emission contains a thermal component .",
    "we thus fit the spectra initially with an absorbed thermal model from collisionally - ionized plasma ( apec in xspec ) . for the absorption model",
    ", we applied the phabs model , which includes the cross sections of @xcite with solar abundances @xcite .",
    "the fit was rejected with a reduced @xmath20/d.o.f . of 405.4/122 even when the abundances of metals were treated as free parameters . introducing a non - equilibrium ionization model ( vnei and vvrnei in xspec ) , we got a better reduced @xmath20/d.o.f . of 232.0/122 and 381.1/123 , respectively , but the fit was still rejected .",
    "the best fit we found with the nei model required a very high temperature , @xmath21@xmath63.4  kev , for the snr as shown in table  [ tab : total - spec ] .",
    "this result suggests that the emission contains a hard tail .",
    "we then tried a two - temperature nei model and a single temperature nei model plus a power - law component .",
    "the former model ( nei+nei ) returned a smaller reduced @xmath20 of 208.6/122 , but required a high temperature ( @xmath222  kev ) and a small ionization timescale ( @xmath23 @xmath24  @xmath13  s ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the ( nei + power - law ) component model , while giving a slightly larger @xmath20 of 223.1/121 , yielded parameters that are reasonable for x - ray emission from an snr . with the available data and complications from the background emission",
    ", we can not easily conclude whether the hard tail is thermal or non - thermal , and so we discuss both models in the following section .",
    "the best - fit models and parameters are shown in table  [ tab : total - spec ] and in figure  [ fig : diffuse_spectra ] ( for the vnei+power - law model ) .",
    "we have made same analysis with another plasma model , vpshock , and found that the results are basically same with the same best - fit parameters and reduced @xmath20 within errors .",
    "we further verified whether the hard - tail component is real or not .",
    "the residuals in the hard x - ray band remain even when we subtract the background photons accumulated from the background region directly .",
    "the background was simulated with the best - fit parameters in the background region fitting ( table  [ tab : background - spec ] ) , which may introduce systematic uncertainty .",
    "we tried fitting with another simulated background set with different parameters within the range of table  [ tab : background - spec ] , and found that the results for the source spectra do not change within error .",
    "under - estimation of the nxb component can cause such a residual emission , but the nxb count rate in the 35  kev ( mainly from the power - law component by cxb , figure  [ fig : diffuse_spectra ] ) is around 10% of that of the total emission , thus it is difficult to consider the hard - tail component as due to the mis - estimation of the nxb , since the nxb reproduceability is around 10% @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the contamination from the bright and hard northern point source , 2xmm  j185114.3@xmath0000004 , is unlikely since the best - fit photon index of the diffuse emission is much softer than that of the point source ( see  [ sec:2xmm ] ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the hard - tail component most likely originates from the snr shell .",
    "we also conducted a spatially resolved spectroscopy of the diffuse emission .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : xrayimage ] , we divided the shell into a northern and southern region and extracted spectra for each region .",
    "for the background subtraction , we used the simulated background for the total emission ( as described above ) . due to the limited statistics",
    ", we allowed the normalization of vnei and power - law components to vary , but the other parameters were fixed to the best - fit value of the total emission .",
    "the best - fit models and parameters are shown in figure  [ fig : diffuse_spectra_2 ] and table  [ tab : diffuse_spectra_2 ] , respectively .",
    "the fitting gave a similar reduced @xmath20/d.o.f to the total emission , even with the smaller number of the free parameters .",
    "it is difficult to judge the emission on the 2xmm  j185114.3@xmath0000004 region is point - like or not due to the contamination of patchy thermal emission @xcite .",
    "we assume it is a point source in the following analysis , and this assumption is supported by the time variability as shown in ",
    "[ sec : timing ] .",
    "we extracted the source photons from a 3  arcmin - radius region .",
    "the background region is the source - free region common to the diffuse emission analysis .",
    "the background - subtracted spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig:2xmmspec ] .",
    "below @xmath63  kev , we see line emission which we believe is associated with contamination from the thermal emission of the snr .",
    "this emission very difficult to subtract correctly due to its patchy distribution .",
    "we thus used only the 310  kev band for the spectral analysis of the point source , since the diffuse emission is significantly fainter than the point source above 3  kev ( see figure  [ fig : diffuse_spectra ] and figure  [ fig:2xmmspec ] ) .",
    "the spectrum extends up to 10  kev , is heavily absorbed , and shows no line - like emission .",
    "an absorbed power - law model was thus adopted as the spectral model .",
    "the absorption model includes the cross sections of @xcite with solar abundance @xcite .",
    "the power - law model yielded an acceptable fit with a hard photon index , @xmath5@xmath61.6 , and a reduced @xmath20 of 191.5/175 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in the second column of table  [ tab : spec_2xmm ] .",
    "we also checked whether there is any significant iron - line emission .",
    "for that , we added a narrow gaussian model with the center energy of 6.4  kev in the fitting , and found a tight upper - limit on the equivalent width of 15  ev .",
    "for the timing analysis of this point source , we also used the 38  kev band and extracted photons from a 3-arcmin radius region .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : xislightcurve ] shows the light curve of 2xmm  j185114.3@xmath0000004 , which reveals a highly time - variable source that decays slowly during the observation .",
    "one can also see rapid flares with a timescale of a few hundred seconds .",
    "the short flares look rather periodic with a timescale of @xmath67000  s , but this variability is not significant in our dataset with the null hypothesis of 20% .",
    "we exclude the thermal wobbling of the satellite as a possible source for the flaring @xcite , since this tentative period is not the same as the suzaku satellite s orbital period ( @xmath696  min ) .",
    "we conclude that this is real time - variability of the source .    in order to examine the spectral changes during the flares",
    ", we compared the count rates in each bin of the light - curve for the 35  kev and 58  kev bands ( i.e. using bands where the source photons are dominant compared with background photons ) .",
    "the right panel shows the 38  kev count rate versus the hardness ratio between these bands .",
    "one can see that there is no strong trend , implying that there is no significant spectral change during the flares .",
    "a coherent pulsation search was also performed although the time resolution of xis is only 8  s @xcite .",
    "no significant pulsations were found in the scanned period range of 16@xmath25  s with the null hypothesis of 31% .",
    "we also analyzed the hxd p - i - n type diode ( pin ) dataset to search for a signal from the source in the energy range above 10  kev .",
    "after background ( nxb+cxb ) subtraction , the remaining count rate in the 1540  kev band in each observation is @xmath26 cnts  s@xmath11 for obsid=507035010 and @xmath27 cnts  s@xmath11 for obsid=507036010 .",
    "this is 9.0% and 5.4% of the nxb count rate in this band , respectively .",
    "the systematic nxb uncertainty is 35% @xcite , thus we conclude that we detect significant emission from the northern part .",
    "the observing region is on the galactic plane , thus we have to carefully account for the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) .",
    "@xcite reports that the 1240  kev hxd pin count rate of the galactic center is @xmath60.5  count  s@xmath11 .",
    "@xcite shows that the surface brightness of grxe is a few percent of that in the gc region , thus the expected count rate is @xmath28 count  s@xmath11 , which is significantly lower than our detection .",
    "moreover , the detection level should be the same in the two observations if the emission is from grxe .",
    "we thus conclude that the emission is not from the grxe .",
    "figure  [ fig : pinlc ] shows the pin 1520  kev light curve after the subtraction of the nxb .",
    "we can see the decay of the emission , which is similar to the light curve of 2xmm  j185114.3@xmath0000004 below 10  kev ( figure  [ fig : xislightcurve ] ) .",
    "this result confirms that the emission is from 2xmm  j185114.3@xmath0000004 .",
    "we have extracted the pin spectrum above 10  kev as shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : pinspec ] .",
    "we fit it with an absorbed power - law model .",
    "the absorption column density was fixed to 11.0@xmath29  @xmath13 , under the assumption that the emission is from 2xmm  j185114.3@xmath0000004 .",
    "the fit was acceptable with a reduced @xmath20 of 12.4/10 .",
    "the best - fit photon index and flux are 4.2 ( 1.76.7 ) and 3.3 ( 2.64.1)@xmath30  erg  @xmath13s@xmath11 in the 1520  kev band , respectively .",
    "the photon index is relatively soft , but consistent within the error range of the xis result on 2xmm  j185114.3@xmath0000004 , which also supports our conclusion on the emission origin .",
    "we thus carried out the combined spectral fitting of xis and pin for 2xmm  j185114.3@xmath0000004 which is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : pinspec ] .",
    "we fit the spectra with an absorbed power - low model again , and the fit was acceptable with a reduced @xmath20 of 208.6/183 .",
    "the best - fit models and parameters are shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : pinspec ] and the third column in table  [ tab : spec_2xmm ] .",
    "we note that we also attempted a absorbed broken - power - low model , but this model did not improve the fit .",
    "hxd has a good timing capability with a 61  @xmath31s time resolution and an accuracy of @xmath32ss@xmath11 per day @xcite .",
    "we thus search for any coherent pulsations of this source using the pin dataset .",
    "we used the 1520  kev range to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "after barycentric correction , we used the powspec command in the xronos package to search the coherent pulsation .",
    "however , we could not detect any coherent signal in the period of 61  @xmath31s to 512  s. we also tried the timing analysis with the xis ( 38  kev ) and pin ( 1520  kev ) combined , and found no significant signal .",
    "we have detected the x - ray shell structure from g32.8@xmath00.1 for the first time .",
    "the best - fit absorption column of @xmath33  @xmath13 is marginally smaller than the absorption column in this direction , 1.51.9@xmath29  @xmath13 . assuming an average density of 0.51  @xmath4 , the expected distance is in the 1.54.6  kpc range .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the distance estimated from the co association .",
    "we thus use hereafter 4.8  kpc for the distance to the remnant .",
    "the size of the x - ray shell is 14@xmath34@xmath3522@xmath34 , which coincides with the radio shell .",
    "the physical size and total luminosity are @xmath36  pc and @xmath37  erg  s@xmath11 ( 0.510  kev ) , assuming the kinematic distance of 4.8  kpc .        in order to estimate the density and shock age of the low - temperature plasma in this snr",

    "the width of 1/12th the snr radius is a rough estimation from the sedov solution .",
    "the total volume is then @xmath38  @xmath39 , where @xmath40 refers to the distance in the unit of 4.8  kpc . assuming a uniform density over the region",
    ", we can derive the average electron density ( @xmath41 ) from the emission measure as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the volume filling factor and we assumed @xmath44 .",
    "we used the vnei+power - law model here ( see table  3 ) ( the two - temperature nei model will not change our parameters estimate within error ) .",
    "the ambient density @xmath45 is 1/4 of @xmath41 , thus @xmath46 this is a rather low density when compared with interstellar medium and other snrs even with the smaller distance estimate inferred from the absorption .",
    "this is suggestive of expansion of g32.8@xmath00.1 into its progenitor s wind bubble .",
    "this is a similar situation to rcw  86 , which expands into the wind bubble with the density of @xmath7@xmath8  @xmath4 @xcite , although rcw  86 is much younger than g32.8@xmath00.1 @xcite .",
    "the anti - correlation with the molecular clouds and existence of oh masers further support this scenario .",
    "together with the @xmath41 estimate and the ionization time - scale derived from the spectral analysis , we can estimate the shock age of this plasma .",
    "adopting @xmath41 of @xmath47 , the resultant shock age ( @xmath48 ) becomes @xmath49 which suggests that g32.8@xmath00.1 is a middle - aged snr .",
    "its low luminosity further supports this conclusion @xcite .    in the spatially resolved spectroscopy",
    ", we derived the emission measure of thermal emission in the northern and southern regions ( table  [ tab : diffuse_spectra_2 ] ) .",
    "the surface brightness is similar in each region since the area scale of the northern region is around 40% that of the southern region .",
    "together with the same temperature in these regions , we conclude that there is no substantial difference in their density .",
    "note that our observations did not fully cover the eastern part of the remnant , where the molecular cloud dominates .",
    "a more complete mapping of the remnant will reveal a clearer correlation between the morphology of the molecular cloud and that of the snr .",
    "the first possibility we consider is the contamination of hard point sources in this region , since the suzaku angular resolution is not so excellent , around 2  arcmin in half power diameter .",
    "we have checked the _",
    "rosat _ pspc image in this region and did not find any bright point source in the field .",
    "furthermore , the power - law component is significant in both the southern and northern snr regions , which would be difficult to explain with point source contribution .",
    "we thus conclude that this emission is not from a point source , although we can not rule out the existence of obscured hard sources .",
    "the second possibility is that it is truly diffuse , but caused ( at least partly ) by the mis - estimation of the cosmic background level .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : background - spec ] , the main background emission above 2  kev is the high - temperature component of the grxe .",
    "the fitting with the two - temperature vnei model shows that the temperature is consistent with the high - temperature component of the grxe .",
    "we thus checked whether the power - law component can be explained by the grxe high - temperature component , and found that we need 27% increase in the flux of the grxe s high - temperature component to reproduce this power - law component .",
    "it is slightly a higher fluctuation than the dispersion of grxe ( uchiyama , h. , 2014 , private communication , see also @xcite ) , but we can not dismiss this possibility .",
    "we need more statistics in the hard x - ray band to distinguish this scenario .",
    "an interesting possibility is a pwn origin .",
    "the photon index and luminosity are typical for middle - aged pwne @xcite . a pwn origin for the h.e.s.s .",
    "emission from the snr region has been also suggested ( kosack et al .",
    "however it is hard to explain both the northern and southern regions having a power - law component ; on the other hand , it is possible that at least part of the emission has a pwn origin .",
    "high - resolution x - ray observations with @xmath50 will be needed to resolve the emission and find any putative pwn or contaminating hard point sources .",
    "the more interesting possibility is that the hard - tail emission is truly diffuse emission originating from the snr . in the scenario where the hard - tail is of thermal nature ,",
    "the high @xmath21 and very small ionization timescale ( @xmath51 , see table  3 ) , imply that the plasma was recently heated and has a low density .",
    "similar high @xmath21 and small @xmath51 plasma was found in rcw  86 @xcite ; it is the ejecta heated by the reverse shock very recently",
    ". this may be the case of g32.8@xmath00.1 , although it is much older than rcw  86 assuming the latter is associated with sn  185 @xcite .",
    "this scenario fits the multi - wavelength observations , and is consistent with the picture that the snr is expanding into a cavity and has hit the molecular cloud recently .",
    "next we consider the non - thermal interpretation of the hard tail as originating from the snr shell .",
    "shocks of snrs accelerate particles up to 10@xmath9  ev , and accelerated electrons emit synchrotorn x - rays @xcite .",
    "the power - law component in g32.8@xmath00.1 can be the synchrotron emission from accelerated electrons .",
    "this scenario is supported by the tev detection.the luminosity of the hard component , 9.7@xmath52 in the 210  kev band , is however rather small for synchrotron x - rays from young snrs ( @xmath53  ergs  s@xmath11 in the 210  kev band ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which further supports the middle - aged scenario .",
    "an explosion in a cavity would keep the shock velocity high for longer which would then lead to a high maximum energy of electrons @xcite .",
    "the average shock velocity inferred from the shock age and the snr radius is 57@xmath54  cm  s@xmath11 , which is also consistent with a middle - aged snr and slower than typical value to emit synchrotron x - rays .",
    "since synchrotron x - rays from shocked plasma are expected to have very thin filament - like structures @xcite , x - ray observations with excellent spatial resolution , such as with _",
    "chandra _ , are needed to confirm this scenario and would further allow for an estimate of the magnetic field .",
    "several snrs have been detected in the gev range by _ fermi _ ( see funk 2011 for a review ) .",
    "their soft gev emission may suggest the escape of high energy particles @xcite .",
    "many of these sources are associated with molecular clouds , and particles accelerated at the shock emit gamma - rays via pion decay with the dense material in the molecular clouds .",
    "our target g32.8@xmath00.1 is interacting with a molecular cloud ( figure  [ fig : multi - band ] ) , which is further supported by the existence of oh masers @xcite .",
    "however , the association between the molecular cloud and gev gamma - ray emission is unclear ; the peak of the molecular cloud is in the eastern and northern region whereas the gamma - ray peak is on the western side without any overlap with molecular cloud and x - ray emission .",
    "( figure  [ fig : multi - band ] ) .",
    "the vhe tev gamma - ray emission , on the other hand , coincides with the molecular cloud peak in the eastern part of the snr , and is therefore likely associated with the snr .    here ,",
    "we introduce two snrs with gamma - rays , w28 and rcw  86 for a comparison to g32.8@xmath00.1 .",
    "w28 is a middle - aged snr with gev and vhe gamma - rays @xcite detected on the north - eastern x - ray shell @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the gev / vhe gamma - ray emission is from high - energy particles that recently escaped from the shock and are interacting with a molecular cloud , giving also rise to oh masers @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emitting plasma in the shell region is in ionization equilibrium @xcite , in contrast to the central emission @xcite .",
    "the vhe gamma - rays from g32.8@xmath00.1 may have a similar origin to w28 .",
    "@xcite suggest the presence of a hard x - ray tail in the w28 shell , which may be related to the hard tail in g32.8@xmath00.1 .",
    "another example , rcw  86 , is a bright shell - like snr in the radio and x - ray bands @xcite expanding in a cavity @xcite .",
    "this snr has non - thermal emission in x - rays , gev , and vhe gamma - rays @xcite , which is similar to our case . on the other hand",
    ", we have no information on the molecular cloud interaction .",
    "more data for such a sample are needed to understand the multi - wavelength and intrinsic properties of these sources .",
    "young snrs with vhe gamma - rays often have no significant thermal x - rays @xcite , suggesting a low - density environment .",
    "such a low density would keep a fast - moving shock speed for a relatively long time and would accelerate particles more efficiently .",
    "we suggest a similarly low density here for g32.8@xmath00.1 .",
    "@xcite reported the swift burst alert telescope detection of the outburst of 2xmm  j185114.3@xmath0000004 on 2012 jun 17 15:46:55 ut . the mean count - rate in the promptly - available xrt data is 0.56 count  s@xmath11 , whereas the catalogued count - rate of this source is equivalent to approximately 0.013 xrt count  s@xmath11 .",
    "no optical counterpart has been found with the uvot observation onboard _",
    "swift_. we also searched for the infrared counterpart in the 2mass point source catalog @xcite .",
    "the nearest 2mass source is 2mass 18511447@xmath00000036 , but the separation between these sources is 2.6  arcsec , which is larger than the position error of the 3xmm source ( 0.63  arcsec ) and the 2mass source ( 0.08  arcsec ) .",
    "we conclude that the source has no infrared counterpart .    with the assumption that the spectral shape is same in the _ swift _ observation and our observation",
    ", we derived the 210  kev flux in the _ swift _ observation to be @xmath55  erg  @xmath13s@xmath11 using webpimms .",
    "this is 1.51.6  count  s@xmath11 in _ suzaku _ xis 310  kev band .",
    "these values are about one order of magnitude larger than the average flux in the _ suzaku _ observation ( table  [ tab : spec_2xmm ] ) , and twice the peak flux ( figure  [ fig : xislightcurve ] ) .",
    "the absorption column of 2xmm  j185114.3@xmath0000004 is significantly larger than that of the snr , implying that this point source is unrelated to the snr . assuming a distance of 10  kpc , the intrinsic average luminosity is @xmath56  erg  s@xmath11 in the 210  kev band .",
    "the absorption column is much higher than the total galactic h  i column density toward the source ( 1.51.8@xmath29  @xmath13 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which implies the source has a local absorption matter .",
    "recently , a new class of galactic transients has been emerging with fast and bright flaring x - ray activity , which is referred to as the supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "these objects are believed to be high - mass x - ray binaries with ( a few - hour long ) hard x - ray spectra , and short and bright flares .",
    "the fast and large time variability , and the hard spectra of 2xmm  j185114.3@xmath0000004 , suggest that this source is one of the sfxts . a rather large luminosity and no strong spectral change",
    "further support this scenario @xcite , although @xcite reported the change of hardness in the case of ax  j1841.0@xmath00536 .",
    "some sfxts show coherent pulsations from 4.7  s @xcite to 1276  s @xcite , but our analysis did not show any evidence for pulsations .",
    "the short timescale flares within a few hundreds second is common in other sfxts @xcite .",
    "the origin of the  7000  s intervals of short flares is unknown .",
    "this timescale is not the _ suzaku _ orbital period ( @xmath696  min , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it is not an artificial feature .",
    "it is longer than the coherent pulsations of other sfxts , or and shorter than their orbital periods ( 3.3165  days ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility is a flaring low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) .",
    "some lmxbs show rapid time variability and hard x - ray spectra ( c.f . , xss  j12270@xmath04859 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , they show spectral hardening during flares , whereas 2xmm  j185114.3@xmath0000004 did nt show any significant spectral change during its flare . furthermore , the spectra of flaring lmxbs are not deeply absorbed , which is also different from our source .",
    "recently , @xcite reported that hmxbs with slow pulsations can be accreting magnetars , and our source can be a similar source .",
    "however , such sources show only interstellar absorption , which is not the case here . a gamma - ray binary can be a candidate for our source given their high variabilities and hard spectra . however , these objects show spectral hardening when they become brighter ( * ? ? ? * for example ) , which is again not in the case of 2xmm  j185114.3@xmath0000004 . in summary ,",
    "follow up high - resolution and deep observations are needed to improve our understanding of this intriguing source .",
