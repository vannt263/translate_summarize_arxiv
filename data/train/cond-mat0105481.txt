    "the interplay between anderson localization and electron - electron interactions belongs to the most important unsolved problems of today s condensed matter physics .",
    "the standard theoretical approach to this problem is based on perturbation theory in both disorder and interactions . in the metallic regime ,",
    "the interactions lead to quantum corrections to the conductivity in addition to the weak - localization corrections @xcite .",
    "a scaling theory @xcite was developed on the basis of these perturbative results .",
    "it predicts that a phase transition between an insulator and a _ normal _ metal , i.e. , a disordered fermi liquid , is possible only for dimensions @xmath0 . in @xmath1",
    "the situation is inconclusive . under renormalization",
    "the disorder flows to zero but the interaction strength diverges , i.e. , the perturbation theory becomes uncontrolled .    the attention to these questions resurged in the mid nineties , mainly due to two surprising developments .",
    "first , shepelyansky suggested @xcite that in the localized regime two interacting particles can form a pair whose localization length is much larger than that of a single particle .",
    "second , measurements @xcite on high - quality si - mosfets revealed indications of a true metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in two dimensions . since these experiments are carried out at low electron density where the coulomb interaction is particularly strong compared to the fermi energy , interaction effects are a likely reason for this phenomenon .",
    "a complete understanding has , however , not yet been obtained . in a number of theories new quantum states of matter",
    "have been postulated , either non - fermi liquid metals or unusual superconductors @xcite .",
    "however , other explanations based on more conventional physics like temperature - dependent disorder @xcite or impurity screening @xcite , imply that the seeming mit is a transient phenomenon , and the true ground state is always an insulator .",
    "we have recently developed @xcite an efficient method to investigate disordered interacting electrons numerically , the hartree - fock ( hf ) based exact diagonalization ( hfd ) .",
    "it is related to the quantum - chemical configuration interaction approach .",
    "we have used this method to study the influence of interactions on the conductance of spinless fermions in one , two , and three dimensions .",
    "we found a delocalizing tendency of the interactions for strong disorder but a localizing one for weak disorder . in this work",
    "we extend our hfd investigations to electrons with spin .",
    "in particular , we calculate the participation number of the many - particle eigenstates in fock space , the localization properties of single - particle excitations , and the kubo - greenwood conductance .",
    "the generic model for _ spinless _ interacting disordered electrons is the quantum coulomb glass @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use a generalization of the quantum coulomb glass to electrons with spin .",
    "it is defined on a regular square lattice with @xmath2 sites occupied by @xmath3 electrons ( @xmath4 ) . to ensure charge neutrality",
    "each lattice site carries a compensating positive charge of @xmath5 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the creation , annihilation and occupation number operators at site @xmath10 and spin @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 denotes all pairs of nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "@xmath13 is the strength of the hopping term , i.e. , the kinetic energy .",
    "we parametrize the interaction @xmath14 by its value @xmath15 between nearest - neighbor sites and include a hubbard interaction @xmath16 .",
    "the random potential values @xmath17 are chosen independently from a box distribution of width @xmath18 and zero mean .",
    "the boundary conditions are periodic and the coulomb interaction is treated in the minimum image convention ( which implies a cut - off at a distance of @xmath19 ) .",
    "a numerically exact solution of a quantum many - particle system requires the diagonalization of a matrix whose dimension increases exponentially with system size .",
    "this severely limits the possible sizes . to overcome this problem",
    "we have developed the hfd method .",
    "the basic idea is to work in a truncated hilbert space consisting of the hf ground state and the low - lying excited slater states . for each disorder configuration",
    "three steps are performed : ( i ) find the hf solution of the problem , ( ii ) determine the @xmath20 slater states with the lowest energies , and ( iii ) calculate and diagonalize the hamilton matrix in the subspace spanned by these states .",
    "the number @xmath20 of basis states determines the quality of the approximation , reasonable values have to be found empirically .",
    "to characterize , to what extent the interactions introduce non - trivial correlations ( beyond the hf level ) into the system we calculate the participation number of the many - particle ground state with respect to the hf slater determinants .",
    "the results for a system of @xmath21 sites at half filling are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fockpn ] .    for @xmath22",
    "the fock space participation number is 1 because the hf approximation is ( trivially ) exact for non - interacting electrons .",
    "increasing the interaction mixes the single - particle states , and the inverse fock space participation number is reduced .",
    "nontrivial interaction effects , if any , become manifest mostly in this region . for even larger interactions",
    "the eigenstates become again more localized in fock space since the hf approximation becomes exact again for @xmath23 .",
    "analogous information can be extracted from the single - particle survival probability @xmath24 which averages the sum of the transmission probabilities of a single - particle excitation to all sites . here",
    "@xmath25 are the retarded and advanced single - particle greens functions . the survival probability at the fermi energy , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quasi ] , is related to the square of the quasiparticle weight .",
    "we now turn to the single - particle localization properties which we characterize by the return probability of the single - particle excitations , @xmath26 however , in this quantity localization and decay of the quasiparticles are entangled . to extract the localization properties we normalize @xmath27 by the survival probability @xmath28 . the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : ret_norm ] show    that , in general , interactions tend to localize the _ single - particle _ excitations .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier hf results @xcite which showed that the coulomb gap in the _ single - particle _ density of states is responsible for the trend towards localization . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ret_norm ] a tiny delocalization seems to occur at low interaction strength and small kinetic energy .",
    "however , the changes are within the statistical errors of our study .    in a real transport experiment",
    "the most accessible observable is the conductance .",
    "theoretically , it can be obtained from linear - response theory .",
    "it is essentially determined by the current - current correlation function of the ground state .",
    "the real ( dissipative ) part of the conductance ( in units of @xmath29 ) at frequency @xmath30 is given by the kubo - greenwood formula @xcite , @xmath31 @xmath32 is the @xmath33 component of the current operator and @xmath34 is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",
    "( [ eq : kubo ] ) describes an isolated system while in a real d.c .",
    "transport experiment the sample is connected to contacts and leads .",
    "this results in a finite life time @xmath35 of the eigenstates leading to an inhomogeneous broadening @xmath36 of the @xmath37 functions in ( [ eq : kubo ] ) @xcite . to suppress the discreteness of the spectrum of a finite system",
    ", @xmath38 should be at least of the order of the single - particle level spacing . here",
    ", this requires comparatively large @xmath39 .",
    "we tested different @xmath38 and found that the conductance _ values _",
    "depend on @xmath38 but the qualitative results do not .    the typical d.c",
    "conductance is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conductance ] .",
    "since the logarithm of the conductance rather than the conductance itself is a self - averaging quantity in a disordered system we calculate the typical conductance by averaging the logarithms of the conductance values of 1000 disorder configurations .",
    "we find that , as in the spinless case , there are two qualitatively different regimes . for large kinetic energy",
    "@xmath13 the interactions always reduce the d.c .",
    "conductance , while for small kinetic energy , i.e. in the localized regime , small and moderate interactions significantly enhance the d.c . conductance . for larger interaction strength",
    "the conductance drops , indicating the crossover to a wigner crystal or wigner glass .",
