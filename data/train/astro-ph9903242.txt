    "the determination of the mass distribution near the center of our galaxy and the question , whether it harbours a supermassive black hole ( bh ) or not , have been long - standing issues ( oort 1977 ; genzel and townes 1987 ; genzel et al .",
    "1994 and ho 1998 for a recent review ) .",
    "various techniques have been used to find the mass of this supermassive compact dark object which is usually identified with the radio source sagittarius a * ( sgr a@xmath1 ) at or near the galactic center . the most detailed information to date comes from the statistical analysis of the dynamics of stars moving in the gravitational field of the central mass distribution ( sellgren et al .",

    "1997 have established that the central dark object has a mass of @xmath2 , concentrated within a radius of 0.016 pc and located very close to sgr a@xmath1 . in the most recent observations , ghez at al .",
    "1998 confirm a mass of @xmath3 , enclosed within a radius of 0.015 pc . in the latter observations ,",
    "the accuracy of the velocity measurements in the central arcsec@xmath4 has been improved considerably , and thus the error bar on the central mass has been reduced by about a factor of 4 . in both data sets , the presence of a supermassive compact dark object",
    "is revealed by the fact that several stars are moving within a projected distance of less than 0.01 pc from the central radio source sgr a@xmath1 at projected velocities in excess of 1000 km / s .",
    "for completeness , we mention here that the mass distribution at the galactic center could also be studied through the motion of gas clouds and streamers ( lacy et al .",
    "1980 ; genzel & townes 1987 ; lacy et al . 1991 ) .",
    "however , gas flows may be easily perturbed by non - gravitational forces such as shocks , radiation pressure , winds , magnetic fields , etc . , and",
    "hence this probe is considered to be less reliable for determining the mass of the compact dark object at the galactic center .",
    "the non - thermal spectrum of sgr a@xmath1 ( serabyn et al . 1997 ) , that has been shown to originate from a very compact source ( rogers et al . 1994 ; genzel et al . 1997 ; ghez et al . 1998 ) , and the low proper motion of sgr a@xmath0 ( backer 1996 ) have led many ( e.g. lynden - bell and rees 1971 ) to suggest that sgr a@xmath1 may be a supermassive bh of mass @xmath5 .",
    "supermassive bhs have also been inferred for several other galaxies such as m87 ( ford et al .",
    "1994 ; harms et al .",
    "1994 ; macchetto et al .",
    "1997 ) and ngc 4258 ( greenhill et al . 1995 ; myoshi et al . 1995 ) . taking this suggestion seriously ,",
    "one is immediately faced with fundamental issues such as the prevalence of supermassive bhs in the nuclei of normal galaxies and the nature of the accretion mechanism that makes sgr a@xmath1 so much fainter than typical active galactic nuclei ( melia 1994 ; narayan et al .",
    "however , as the best current observations probe the gravitational potential at radii @xmath6 larger than the schwarzschild radius of a bh of mass @xmath7 ( ghez et al .",
    "1998 ) , it is perhaps prudent not to focus too much on the bh scenario , without having explored alternative scenarios for the supermassive compact dark object .",
    "one alternative to the bh scenario is a very compact stellar cluster ( haller et al .",
    "1996 , sanders , 1992 ) . however , based on the evaporation and collision time stability criteria ,",
    "it is doubtful that such clusters could have survived up to the present time ( see moffat 1997 for an alternative point of view ) .",
    "indeed , in the case of our galaxy and ngc 4258 , maoz ( 1995,1998 ) has found that even the lower limits to the half - mass densities of such compact clusters ( @xmath8 for ngc 4258 and @xmath9 for our galaxy ) are too large that they could be due to stable clusters of stellar or substellar remnants .",
    "the estimated maximal lifetimes for such dense clusters are about @xmath10 years for our galaxy and a few @xmath11 years for the ngc 4258 , i.e. much shorter than the age of the universe .",
    "this seems to rule out the existence of dense clusters at the centers of the above mentioned galaxies , unless we are prepared to believe that we happen to live in a privileged epoch of the lifetime of the universe .",
    "note , however , that for other galaxies , such as m31 , m32 , m87 , ngc 3115 , ngc 3377 , ngc 4261 , ngc 4342 , ngc 4486b and ngc 4594 , maximal lifetimes of dense stellar clusters are in excess of @xmath12 years .",
    "moreover , it should be acknowledged that the uncertainties in the understanding of the core collapse process of such dense clusters still leave some room for speculation about a possible interpretation of the supermassive compact dark objects at the centers of galaxies ( including both , our galaxy and ngc 4258 ) in terms of e.g. core - collapsed clusters ( maoz 1998 ) .",
    "but , apart from a cluster of very low mass bh s that is free of stability problems , the most attractive alternative to a dense stellar cluster is a cluster of elementary particles .",
    "in fact , in the recent past , an alternative model for the supermassive compact dark objects in galactic centers has been developed ( viollier et al .",
    "1992 , 1993 ; viollier 1994 ; tsiklauri and viollier 1996 , 1998a , b , 1999 ; bili et al . 1998 ; bili et al .",
    "the cornerstone of this model is that the dark matter at the center of galaxies is made of nonbaryonic matter in the form of massive neutrinos that interact gravitationally forming supermassive neutrino balls in which the degeneracy pressure of the neutrinos balances their self - gravity .",
    "such neutrino balls could have been formed in the early universe during a first - order gravitational phase transition ( bili and viollier 1997,1998,1999a , b ) .",
    "in fact , it has been recently shown that the dark matter concentration observed through stellar motion at the galactic center ( eckart & genzel 1997 ; genzel et al .",
    "1996 ) is consistent with a supermassive object of @xmath13 solar masses made of self - gravitating , degenerate heavy neutrino matter ( tsiklauri & viollier 1998a ) .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that an acceptable fit to the infrared and radio spectrum above 20 ghz , which is presumably emitted by the compact dark object , can be reproduced in the framework of standard accretion disk theory ( tsiklauri & viollier 1999 ; bili et al .",
    "1998 ) , in terms of a baryonic disk immersed in the shallow potential of the degenerate neutrino ball of @xmath13 solar masses .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to compare the predictions of these two models for the supermassive compact dark object at the center our galaxy , i.e. ( i ) the black hole scenario and ( ii ) the degenerate neutrino ball scenario as an example of an extended object .",
    "both these models are not in contradiction with the technologically challenging proper motions observations and their statistical interpretation ( genzel et al .",
    "1997 ; ghez et al .",
    "it is therefore desirable to have an additional independent dynamical test , in order to distinguish between these two possible scenarios describing the compact dark object at the center of our galaxy . in the recent past",
    ", mainly statistical arguments involving many stars have been used to determine the gravitational potential at the galactic center . however , in this paper , we would like to demonstrate that it is also possible to draw definite conclusions from the motion of individual stars , in particular , in the immediate vicinity of the galactic center , where statistical arguments can not be easily applied due to the low density of stars .",
    "to this end , we have recently calculated the orbits ( munyaneza , tsiklauri and viollier 1998 ) of the fastest moving infrared source s1 using the genzel et al . 1997 data for a supermassive bh or a neutrino ball mass of @xmath14 solar masses .",
    "we have shown that tracking the orbits of s1 offers a good opportunity to distinguish in a few years time between the two scenarios for the supermassive compact dark object .",
    "here we perform a full analysis of the orbits of the same star s0 - 1 based on the most recent ghez et al .",
    "1998 data , including all the error bars of the measurements .",
    "a distance to the galactic center of 8 kpc has been assumed throughout this paper .    this paper is organized as follows : in section  2 , we present the equations that describe degenerate neutrino balls and we establish some constraints on the neutrino mass based on ghez et al .",
    "1998 data . in section  3",
    ", we study the dynamics of s0 - 1 and conclude with the discussion in section  4 .",
    "dark matter at the galactic center can be described by the gravitational potential @xmath15 of the neutrinos and antineutrinos that satisfies poisson s equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is newton s gravitational constant and @xmath18 is the mass density of the neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "neutrino matter will interact gravitationally to form supermassive neutrino balls in which self - gravity of the neutrinos is being balanced by their degeneracy pressure @xmath19 according to the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath20 in order to solve equation ( [ eq:01 ] ) , one needs a relation between the pressure @xmath21 and the density @xmath18 . to this end",
    "we choose the polytropic equation of state of degenerate neutrino matter , i.e. @xmath22 where the polytropic constant @xmath23 is given by ( viollier , 1994 ) @xmath24 here , @xmath25 denotes the neutrino mass , @xmath26 is the spin degeneracy factor of the neutrinos and antineutrinos , i.e. @xmath27 for majorana and @xmath28 for dirac neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "we now introduce the dimensionless potential and radial variable , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , by @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the dimensionless radius of the neutrino ball , and the scale factor @xmath34 which plays here the role of a length unit is given by @xmath35 assuming spherical symmetry , we finally arrive at the non - linear lan - emden equation @xmath36 with polytropic index 3/2 .",
    "the boundary conditions are chosen in such a way that @xmath29 vanishes at the boundary @xmath37 of the neutrino ball .",
    "the mass @xmath38 of a ( pointlike ) baryonic star at the center of the neutrino ball is fixed by @xmath39 .",
    "the case @xmath40 corresponds to a pure neutrino ball without a pointlike source at the center .",
    "the mass enclosed within a radius @xmath41 in a pure neutrino ball can be written in terms of @xmath42 and its derivative @xmath43 as @xmath44    in order to describe the compact dark object at the galactic center as a neutrino ball and constrain its physical parameters appropriately , it is worthwhile to use the most recent observational data by ghez et al .",
    "1998 , who established that the mass enclosed within 0.015 pc at the galactic center is @xmath45 solar masses . following the analysis of tsiklauri & viollier 1998a",
    ", we choose the minimal neutrino mass @xmath25 to reproduce the observed matter distribution , as can be seen from fig .  1 , where we have added the ghez et al .",
    "1998 and genzel et al .",
    "1997 data points with error bars . in fig .",
    "1 we include only the neutrino ball contribution to the enclosed mass , as the stellar cluster contribution is negligible by orders of magnitude at these radii . for a @xmath46 neutrino ball ,",
    "the constraints on the neutrino mass are @xmath47   kev@xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50kev@xmath51 for @xmath52 , and the radius of the neutrino ball is @xmath53 . using the value of @xmath54 , the bounds on the neutrino mass are @xmath55 kev@xmath48 for @xmath27 or @xmath56 kev@xmath48 for @xmath28 and the radius of the neutrino ball turns out to be @xmath57 .",
    "finally , for a @xmath58 neutrino ball , the range of neutrino mass is @xmath59kev@xmath48 for @xmath60 and @xmath61kev@xmath48 for @xmath28 and the corresponding neutrino ball radius @xmath62 pc .",
    "we investigate the motion of s0 - 1 that is the star closest to the galactic center , and at the same time , also the fastest of the 15 stars in the central arcsec@xmath63 around sgr a@xmath1 .",
    "we study the motion of s0 - 1 in the gravitational potential near sgr a@xmath1 , assuming that the central object is either a bh of mass @xmath64 or a spatially extended object represented by a neutrino ball of mass @xmath64 , that consists of self - gravitating degenerate heavy neutrino matter .",
    "the bh or neutrino ball mass @xmath64 will be taken to be 2.4 , 2.6 and 2.8 @xmath65 solar masses which corresponds to the range allowed by the ghez et al .",
    "1998 data .",
    "we use newtonian dynamics , as the problem is essentially nonrelativistic , because the mass of the neutrino ball is much less than the oppenheimer - volkoff limit corresponding to this particular neutrino mass ( bili , munyaneza & viollier 1999 ) .",
    "consequently , we can write newton s equations of motion as @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath30 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 denote the components of the radius vector of the star s0 - 1 and @xmath71 , sgr a@xmath1 being the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "we thus assume that the center of the neutrino ball and the bh is at the position of sgr a@xmath1 .",
    "the dot denotes of course the derivative with respect to time . in the case of a bh , @xmath72 is independent of @xmath41 , while in the neutrino ball scenario , @xmath73 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:09 ] ) and it reaches @xmath74 at the radius of the neutrino ball @xmath75 . the initial positions and velocities for this system of equations are taken to be those of s0 - 1 in 1995.4 , when the coordinates of s0 - 1 were @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath69 components of the projected velocity are @xmath78  km / s and @xmath79  km / s ( ghez et al .",
    "1998 ) , respectively . here",
    "@xmath30 is opposite to the ra direction and @xmath69 is in the dec direction .    in fig .  2 we plot two typical orbits of s0 - 1 corresponding to a bh and neutrino ball mass of @xmath80 .",
    "the input values for @xmath81 and @xmath82 are 470 km / s and -1330 km / s , respectively .",
    "the _ z_-coordinate of the star s0 - 1 is assumed to be zero and the velocity component in the line - of - sight of the star s0 - 1 , @xmath83 , has also been set equal to zero in this graph .",
    "the filled square labels denote the time in years from 1990 till 2015 . in the case of a bh ,",
    "the orbit of s0 - 1 is an ellipse , with sgr a@xmath1 being located in one focus ( denoted by the star in the figure ) .",
    "the period of s0 - 1 is 12.7 years and the minimal and maximal distances from sgr a@xmath1 are 1.49 and 7.18 light days , respectively . in the case of a neutrino ball ,",
    "the orbit will be bound but not closed , with minimal and maximal distances from sgr a@xmath1 of 3.98 and 42.07 light days , respectively .",
    "it can be seen from fig .  2 that , in the case of a neutrino ball , s0 - 1 is deflected much less than for a bh , as the gravitational force at a given distance from sgr a@xmath1 is determined by the mass enclosed within this distance . using eq .",
    "( [ eq:09 ] ) we can estimate the mass enclosed within a radius corresponding to the projected distance of s0 - 1 from sgr a@xmath1 ( @xmath84 pc ) to be @xmath85 .",
    "thus , in the case of a neutrino ball , the force acting on s0 - 1 is about 14 times less than in the case of a bh .",
    "this graph can serve to establish , whether sgr a@xmath1 is a bh or an extended object , due to the fact that the positions of s0 - 1 will differ as time goes on in the two scenarios . however , this conclusion is perhaps too optimistic , as we have not yet considered ( i ) the uncertainties in @xmath81 and @xmath82 , ( ii ) the error bars in the total mass of the bh or neutrino ball , ( iii ) the complete lack of information on @xmath70 and @xmath83 .    as a next step ,",
    "we investigate the dependence of the orbits on the uncertainties in the velocity components .",
    "the results of this calculation are presented in fig .  3 where we have set @xmath86 .",
    "in the case of a bh , the orbits of s0 - 1 are ellipses , while the other 5 thick lines are bound orbits of s0 - 1 for the neutrino ball scenario .",
    "the spread of the orbits induced by the error bars in @xmath81 and @xmath82 is small compared to that of the recent analysis based on the genzel et al .",
    "1997 data ( munyaneza , tsiklauri & viollier 1998 ) .",
    "the time labels , represented by filled squares on the orbits , are placed in intervals of 5 years : starting from 1995.4 up to 2005 in the case of a bh , and up to 2015 in the case of a neutrino ball .",
    "the periods of s0 - 1 for different orbits vary between 10 and 17 years for the bh scenario .",
    "we thus see that the error bars in @xmath81 and @xmath82 do not alter the predictions of fig .  1 in substance .",
    "we now would like to study , how the orbits are changed if we let the mass of the neutrino ball or the bh vary within the estimated error bars ( ghez et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in fig .",
    "4 and 5 , we present the results of our calculations , for both scenarios , with central masses of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "the neutrino masses consistent with the ghez et al .",
    "( 1998 ) data are are @xmath47 kev@xmath48 for a @xmath87 neutrino ball and @xmath89 kev@xmath48 for a @xmath88 neutrino ball .",
    "the filled squares represent the time labels spaced by 5 year intervals as in fig .  3 .",
    "in the bh scenario , the periods of s0 - 1 with @xmath90 vary between 11 years and 20 years , while in the case of a @xmath58 , the periods vary between 9.5 and 15 years . comparing the orbits of s0 - 1 in fig .  4 and 5 with those in fig .  3 , we conclude that the errors bars in the total mass of the bh or neutrino ball make no qualitative difference for the motion of s0 - 1 . in both scenarios of the supermassive compact dark object ,",
    "all the orbits considered for three different values of the bh or neutrino ball mass are bound for @xmath86 , as can be seen from fig .  6 and 7 , where the escape and circular velocities are plotted as functions of the distance from sgr a@xmath1 . in these graphs",
    ", we have also included the ghez et al .",
    "( 1998 ) data with error bars , for the 15 stars in the central arsec@xmath63 , assuming that the velocity component and distance from sgr a@xmath1 in the line - of - sight are both zero , i.e. @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "thus , the data points are lower bounds on the true circular or escape velocity and radius , and the real values lie in the quarter - plane to the right - and - up of the measured data point . for instance , the innermost data point describing the star s0 - 1 is in both scenarios , consistent with a bound orbit if @xmath93 and @xmath94 are not too large , as can be seen from the escape velocity in fig .  6 .",
    "however , s0 - 1 can not be interpreted as a virialized star in the neutrino ball scenario , as is evident from the plot of the circular velocity in fig  7 ; it thus would have to be an intruder star .",
    "if the projected velocity of a star at a given projected distance from sgr a@xmath1 is larger than the escape velocity at the same distance ( assuming @xmath92 ) , the neutrino ball scenario is virtually ruled out , since the kinetic energy of the star would have to be very large at infinity .",
    "we now turn to the investigation of the dependence of the orbits on the @xmath70 coordinate and @xmath70 component of the velocity of the star s0 - 1 .",
    "the two quantities , @xmath70 and @xmath83 , are the major source of uncertainty in determining the exact orbit of the star s0 - 1 .",
    "however , this shortcoming will not substantially affect the predictive power of our model , as we will see below . in fig .",
    "8 we show the results of a calculation of the dependence of the orbit on @xmath70 for a @xmath95 neutrino ball or bh .",
    "the input values for @xmath81 and @xmath82 are fixed at 470 km / s and -1330 km / s , respectively , and @xmath83 is assumed to be zero .",
    "the @xmath70-coordinate is varied from zero up to the radius of the neutrino ball , i.e. the distance from sgr a@xmath1 beyond which there is obviously no difference between the bh and the neutrino ball scenarios . in this case , the radius of the neutrino ball @xmath96 pc or 0.485 @xmath97 .",
    "the top panel represents the orbits in the case of a bh , for different values of @xmath70 , while the lower panel describes the dependence of the orbit on @xmath70 in the neutrino ball scenario .",
    "we conclude from this plot that , increasing @xmath93 has the effect of shifting the orbits towards the lower right corner of the graph .",
    "this is , obviously , due to the fact that increasing @xmath93 means going further away from the scattering center , thus yielding less deflection of the orbit .",
    "moreover , in the neutrino ball scenario , the dependence on @xmath70 is relatively insignificant , as long as @xmath93 is smaller than the radius of the neutrino ball .",
    "this is in accordance with the fact that for small distances from the center , the potential of a neutrino ball can be approximated by a harmonic oscillator - type potential , where the newtonian equations of motion decouple in cartesian coordinates .",
    "the dependence of the orbits of s0 - 1 on @xmath83 has a similar effect as in the previous graph.here , we have fixed @xmath70 to zero and @xmath83 has been varied as an input parameter .",
    "increasing @xmath94 yields a greater velocity of the star and , obviously , a fast moving star will be deflected less than a star with smaller @xmath94 .",
    "the results of this calculation are summarized in fig .",
    "we have demonstrated that the orbits of s0 - 1 differ substantially for the bh and neutrino ball scenarios of the galactic center , especially with the new ghez et al .",
    "( 1998 ) data .",
    "we have shown that using these data , the error bars in velocities of s0 - 1 and mass of the central object do not change the pattern of the orbits of s0 - 1 . in the case of a bh ,",
    "the orbit of s0 - 1 is much more curved than in the neutrino ball scenario , as long as @xmath93 is smaller than the radius of the neutrino ball .",
    "increasing @xmath93 and @xmath94 shifts the orbits to the lower right corner of the graph , and this gives us a key to establish the allowed regions of s0 - 1 depending on whether it is a bh or a neutrino ball , _ irrespective _ of the values of the parameters @xmath70 and @xmath83 . in fig .",
    "10 three orbits are plotted : the upper - leftmost orbit of s0 - 1 corresponding to the neutrino ball scenario ( actually , line 9 of fig .",
    "4 ) and two orbits in a bh scenario with the smallest minimal and maximal distances from sgr a@xmath1 ( ellipses 2 and 4 from fig.5 ) . this figure serves as a test to distinguish the supermassive bh scenario from the neutrino ball model of the galactic center .",
    "it is clear that , as the observations proceed within the next year , one might be able to tell the difference between the two models of the supermassive compact dark object at the center of our galaxy .",
    "if the star is found in the region @xmath98 inside the ellipses , this will rule out both the bh and the neutrino ball scenario of sgr a@xmath1 , as seen in fig .  10 .",
    "we can estimate the minimal distance of approach to sgr a@xmath1 to be 0.909 light days .",
    "if the orbit of s0 - 1 ends up in the upper - left zone of the thick line , this will clearly rule out the neutrino ball scenario for the chosen lower limit of the neutrino mass .",
    "however , if s0 - 1 is found in the lower right corner of the same line ( i.e. below the thick line ) , then the supermassive object can be interpreted as either a neutrino ball or a bh with a large @xmath70 or @xmath83 parameter",
    ". one can of course repeat this analysis for several stars in the central arcsec@xmath63 and use some statistical arguments : should there be no stars in the black hole zone , and many stars found in the zone for black holes and neutrino balls , the black hole interpretation of the supermassive compact dark object at the galactic center would become less attractive , as some of the stars should be moving close to the plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight , i.e. they should have small @xmath94 and @xmath93 .",
    "the neutrino masses used for the neutrino ball are lower limits .",
    "we note that increasing the neutrino mass will make the radius smaller ( the neutrino ball radius scales as @xmath99 ) and , when it reaches the mass corresponding to the oppenheimer - volkoff limit , there will be little difference between the two scenarios .",
