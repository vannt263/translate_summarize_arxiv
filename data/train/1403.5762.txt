    "the field of quantum computation and the idea of universal quantum simulator was first introduced by richard feynman in 1982@xcite,@xcite .",
    "he showed that a classical turing machine would presumably experience an exponential slowdown when simulating quantum phenomena , while his hypothetical universal quantum simulator would not . the algorithm for quantum computing and quantum information theory developed fast , first work done with shor s algorithm@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this algorithm can be used to quickly factories large number more fast and it also have a profound effect on cryptography , or lov grover s algorithm that search unsorted database faster than conventional computer@xcite .    over the past decades , along with the theoretical development , people have tried to find the systems which suitable for using them as the component of quantum computers .",
    "the basic buildong block of quantum computer which is the heart of quantum quantum information is a two level quantum systems known as quantum bits or qubits .",
    "if the quantum bit locates at it s ground state , it represent the state @xmath0 and if the qubits excited , it locates at the state @xmath1 .",
    "fortunately there are many systems that can be candidate for selecting them as two level quantum systems@xcite .",
    "qubits which invented by using the solid - state devices satisfy what we requires from qubits such as atoms , ions and nucleus .",
    "one of the promising candidates are devices based on superconducting josephson junction .",
    "these devices show the quantum effects in macroscopic scale and it s the most advantage of these devices@xcite,@xcite.josephson qubits can be categorized into three main classes : charge , phase and flux qubits , and in each system one of the physical measurable quantity is our quantum parameter and suitable for manipulation @xcite .",
    "a viable quantum computer needs to has a the stable and long - live qubits that make their coherency for long time before the manipulation and operation acts on them .",
    "thus in order to building the quantum bits and quantum gates with high accuracy and high fidelity we need to have a deep recognition to the exact description physics of the system which in translation to quantum mechanics , it mean we should have a precise analysis on evolution of hamiltonian which is completely time - dependent .",
    "finding the energy levels of qubits and their corresponding states in the time - independent regime is easiest than the time - dependent form .",
    "there are various method to solve the time - independent quantum mechanics problem such as perturbation theory or wkb theory .",
    "but in fact in fact wkb is uncontrolled approximation in general and it is hard to say that the result of this methods is accurate or not@xcite,@xcite .",
    "therefor find the methods that help us to get the more accurate and reliable result is very important and essential . in the other hand",
    "there is always thermal noises in the physical system and measurements do with certain accuracy , therefore finding the analytical parameter of system must be proportional to practical inaccuracy.in fact as we shown the preceding section , in practice we need to know the value of energy levels of order @xmath2 .    in this paper",
    "we claim that functional formalism of quantum mechanics and feynman path integral give us the more accurate answer that we need , admittedly the formalism of path integral has been built completely time dependent and it s the biggest treasure that lies down in this formalism .",
    "the basic idea of the path integral formulation and using of the lagrangian in quantum mechanics introduced by p. a. m. dirac and norbert wiener @xcite,@xcite the complete method was developed in 1948 by richard feynman .",
    "broadly speaking there are two approache to the formulation of quantum mechanics , the operator approach based on the canonical quantization of physical observables and the associated operator algebra and feynman path integral , in fact the path integral formulation has many advantages most of which explicitly support an intuitive understanding of quantum mechanics and this is now the standard mathematical formalism used by most physicists working in quantum field theories , because it is extremely powerful , highly visual , and will often yield answers far more quickly and simply than other formalisms .    here at",
    "first we review on path integral formalism , the we study to specific hamiltonian and bounce motion",
    ". then we review on instanton model , based on path integral and apply it s result to understanding the hamiltonian in there types of superconducting qubits and discuss on results .",
    "finally we discuss on time - dependency of hamiltonian in superconducting qubits and their measurement and it s application on building the quantum gates .",
    "more than any other formulation of quantum mechanics , the path integral formalism is based on connections to classical mechanics . in the classical mechanics ,",
    "trajectories are allowed in configuration space which extermize action functional . a principal constraint to be imposed on any such trajectory",
    "is energy conservation .",
    "by contrast in quantum mechanics particle have a little bit more freedom than their classical counterparts .",
    "a classical particle is always reflected by a potential barrier if it s energy is lower than the potential .",
    "in contrast , a quantum particle has a non - vanishing probability to tunnel through a barrier , a property also called barrier penetration . also in particulare by the uncertainty principle , energy conservation can be violated by a an amount @xmath3 over a time @xmath4 .",
    "the connection to action principles of classical mechanics becomes particularly apparent in problem of quantum tunneling .",
    "a particle with energy @xmath5 can tunnel through a potential of height @xmath6 which @xmath7 .",
    "however , this process is penalized by a damping factor @xmath8 where @xmath9 and integration is over barrier .",
    "this means that the exponent of the action associated with the classically forbidden path .",
    "these observation motivate the idea of new formulation of quantum propagation , could it be as in classical mechanics , the quantum amplitude @xmath10 for propagating between any two points in coordinate space is again controlled by the action functional .",
    "one might speculate that the amplitude in quantum mechanics is obtained as @xmath11/\\hbar)$ ] where this sum is over all paths compatible with initial conditions of the problem and @xmath12 stands for the classical action . with this ansatz",
    "some feature of quantum mechanics can be observe . in the classical limit , @xmath13",
    ", the amplitude would become dominated by contribution to the sum from classical path .",
    "also quantum mechanical tunneling would be natural element of theory , non - classical path do contribute to the net amplitude but at the cost of damping factor specified by the imaginary action . by this introduction",
    "we maybe ready to constructing the formalism .      in this section",
    "we discuss on formalism of feynman path integral in general form which the hamiltonian , @xmath14 , can be function of time .",
    "we emphasize on time dependency of functionals in theory , because this is one of the main reason that we use from feynman path integral formalism to solving our problem .",
    "we consider a bounded operator in hilbert space , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , which describes the evolution from time @xmath17 to time @xmath18 and satisfies a markov property in time @xcite @xmath19 also we consider @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , we assume that u(t , t ) is differentiable with a continues derivative .",
    "we set @xmath21 here @xmath2 is real parameter and as we know later it becomes planck s constant .",
    "with this two fundamental properties we can obtain interesting result . by differentiating the eq.[a1000 ] with respect to t and take the @xmath22 we find @xmath23    in the simple case , if @xmath14 be time - independent the propagator has the simple form @xmath24 and @xmath25 become additive , @xmath26 .",

    "it real problemm , especially in phas qubits the state are time dependent too and if we want to be more careful it s better to use the path integral formalism , as we know @xmath501 then in order to estimating the property of @xmath502 we have @xmath503",
    "now , at the end of this paper maybe merits of path integral has been more appear to us whereas the classical limits is not always easy to retrieve within the canonical formulation of quantum mechanics , it constantly remains visible in the path integral approach .",
    "also the path integrals allow for an efficient formulation of non - perturbative approaches to the solution of quantum mechanics problems .",
    "we obtain the state and metastable state of phase qubits for the first time and the properties of flux and charge which obtained with path integral method were consistent whit other method s result but with more visibility and more accuracy . in the other hand the path integral does nt have time dependent or time independent case , it describe the evolution of system clearly without approximation which we introduce in usual quantum mechanic such as dyson series and etc . in the recent works we are trying to obtain the spectrum of hamiltonian during the time to reveal how this method in valuable and how it can increase our accuracy as much as we need .",
    "the main idea of semi - classical approach in path integral is using the property of gaussian integral and wick s theorem@xcite , we briefly discuss about it here .",
    "the gaussian integral @xmath504 converges if the matrix@xmath505 with elements @xmath506 is a symmetric complex matrix such that the real part of the matrix is non-negative.this implies that all eigenvalues of @xmath507 are non - negative and no eigenvalue @xmath508 of @xmath509 vanishes    @xmath510    in several way we can proof that @xmath511    we start the proof with real matrix and in the next step , we develop it for imaginary matrix .",
    "any real symmetric matrix can be diagonalized by an orthogonal transformation and the matrix @xmath509 in can thus be written as    @xmath512    where matrix @xmath509 is orthogonal , @xmath513 , and @xmath514 is diagonal matrix with element : @xmath515.by changing the variable @xmath516 in integral we have    @xmath517    the jacobian of this transformation is    @xmath518    therefore @xmath519 as the matrix @xmath509 is positive , all eigenvalues @xmath508 are positive thus the integral converge and we find that @xmath520    in the most general form we have @xmath521    to calculate this integral , one looks for the minimum of the quadratic form @xmath522    introducing the inverse matrix @xmath523    one can write the solution as @xmath524    by changing the variable @xmath525 we have @xmath526 then the integral becomes @xmath527 in the case that matrix be imaginary the proof need more effort which available in ref .",
    "the steepest decent method is an approximation scheme to estimating certain types of contour integral in complex domain .",
    "it involve approximation integral by a sum of gaussian expectation value.here we would like to analysis the real integral such as @xmath528 which @xmath529 is real function and we consider that @xmath529 in analytic in the integral interval and it has absolute minimum in this region .",
    "we want to evaluate the integral in the limit of @xmath530 . in this limit",
    "the integral is dominated by the maximum of the integrand which it means minimum of @xmath529 .",
    "if the minimum occur in @xmath79 then we have @xmath531 and generally @xmath532 .therefore the integration domain can restricted to a neighborhood @xmath533 which @xmath162 is arbitrarily small .as we can say @xmath534 the the region that contributes is of order @xmath535 , thus it is convenient to change variable @xmath536 by @xmath537 .",
    "then the expansion converts to @xmath538 if we need to calculate just leading order therefore we have @xmath539    we can extend domain of integral to infinity because of for similar reason contributions from outside the integration domain are exponentially small in @xmath540 .the leading contribution is thus given by gaussian integral which yields @xmath541 to calculating the the higher order correction , in similar way yields @xmath542 which @xmath543 given by@xcite @xmath544",
    "there is an alternative way to solving the schrdinger equation by wkb method , in this approach we consider wave function is given by the form of @xmath545 where @xmath546 in general can be complex function and is possible to extend it by @xmath2 @xmath547                    now for finding the relation between the coefficient we need to introduce the patch - functions which describe our wave function near the turning points .",
