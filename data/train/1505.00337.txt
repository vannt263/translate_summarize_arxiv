    "the radial distribution of gas - phase oxygen abundances traced by hii regions has been investigated in the disks of many spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "it was found that almost all spiral galaxies show radial abundance gradients in the sense that their inner hii regions ( i.e. , those closer to the galactic centers ) have higher oxygen abundances than the outer ones .",
    "the radial distribution of abundances across the disks of irregular galaxies is less well studied .",
    "@xcite analyzed spectra of a number of hii regions in the small and large magellanic clouds .",
    "they determined the abundances in hii regions through the effective temperature ( @xmath1 ) method using their own measurements together with the spectral measurements by other authors and examined the spatial distributions of abundances in those galaxies .",
    "@xcite concluded that any radial abundance gradient in present - day abundances is small or absent in the large magellanic cloud and is conspicuously absent in the small magellanic cloud . in the small magellanic cloud ,",
    "also stellar metallicity determinations support the absence of a radial gradient , although there is a large metallicity spread of @xmath3 dex in [ fe / h ] for a given age @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the oxygen abundance distributions in the disks of the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc  2366 and the dwarf seyfert i galaxy ngc  4395 using imaging spectrophotometry with narrow - band filters in the lines of h@xmath4 , h@xmath5 , [ oiii]@xmath65007 and [ nii]@xmath66584 .",
    "they used the line ratio [ oiii]/[nii ] as an abundance indicator ( o3n2 calibration ) .",
    "they found that there is no global oxygen abundance gradient across the disks of those galaxies .",
    "@xcite obtained emission - line long - slit spectra of 189 hii regions in a sample of 65 _ i m _ , _ sm _ , and blue compact dwarf galaxies .",
    "they estimated the oxygen abundances in hii regions using the line ratio [ oiii]/[nii ] ( o3n2 calibration ) and the combination of @xmath7 = [ oiii]+[oii ] and [ oiii]/[oii ] ( two - dimensional @xmath7 calibration ) when the oxygen line [ oii]@xmath63727 was measured .",
    "@xcite examined the radial abundance distribution in disks of eight _ sm _ and _ i m _ galaxies for which they measured at least three hii regions .",
    "they found that the oxygen abundances within a given galaxy generally vary by about 0.2 dex , but they did not detect a trend in oxygen abundances with radius except for the _ sm _ galaxy ddo  204 .",
    "@xcite measured oxygen abundances with the direct method in three hii regions in each of the dwarf irregulars sextans  a and sextans  b. while they found sex  a to be chemically homogeneous , one of the three hii regions in sex  b turned out to be about twice as metal - rich than the other two , and the abundances of other heavy elements suggest an enrichment by a factor of @xmath8 as compared to the other two hii regions .",
    "@xcite attribute this to inhomogeneous chemical enrichment .",
    "@xcite carried out long - slit spectroscopy of 67 hii regions in 21 dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "oxygen abundances for 25 hii regions were derived through the direct @xmath1 method ; the abundances in other hii regions were estimated using strong line calibrations .",
    "@xcite considered the oxygen abundances as a function of radius for 12 irregular galaxies with three or more observations and found that the abundances are very similar ( within the formal errors ) within each galaxy with the possible exception of the galaxy ugc  12894 .",
    "@xcite noted that the radial trend in oxygen abundances ( three points ) in the ugc  12894 may be artificial because the abundances of the inner and outer hii regions were obtained via different methods ( through the strong line calibration for two inner hii regions and through the @xmath1 method for outer hii region ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite obtained oxygen abundances for 35 hii regions in eight dwarf galaxies in the centaurus  a group and in 13 hii regions in closer dwarfs .",
    "some of their measurements use the direct @xmath1 method , while the majority of the abundance determinations is based on strong - line calibrations .",
    "although the results for individual hii regions in a given galaxy tend to vary , lee et al .   point out that the variations are within the uncertainties of the strong - line method . in one of the dwarf irregulars of the cen  a group ,",
    "am  @xmath9 , one of the hii regions is considerably more oxygen - rich than the others .",
    "lee et al.argue that the measured line intensity ratios suggest that this emission nebula is a supernova remnant .",
    "they also note that radial gradients may exist in some of their targets such as in the _ sm _ ngc3109 or ngc5264 , but that more and deeper data are needed to establish this .",
    "it is the current belief that irregular galaxies generally do not show radial abundance gradients in their young populations and are chemically homogeneous .",
    "this implies that there is a ",
    "spiral versus irregular dichotomy \" in the sense that there is a sudden change from spiral ( radial abundance gradients are usually present ) to irregular galaxies ( typically no gradients ) .",
    "however , other properties ( e.g. , gas fraction , global metallicity ) vary smoothly in transition from spirals to irregulars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) .",
    "the measurements of the abundance gradients in the disks of irregular galaxies often encounter the following difficulty .",
    "reliable oxygen abundances in a number of hii regions in the disk of a galaxy should be determined in order to evaluate the existence of an abundance gradient .",
    "abundance determinations using the direct @xmath1 method require high - precision spectroscopy including the weak auroral lines [ oiii]@xmath64363 or / and [ nii]@xmath65755 .",
    "unfortunately , these weak auroral lines are usually only detected in the spectra of a few ( if any ) of the brightest hii regions in a given irregular galaxy .",
    "the oxygen abundances in the other hii regions are then estimated using the strong - line method pionered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the principal idea of the strong - line method is to establish the relation between the ( oxygen ) abundance in an hii region and some combination of the intensities of strong emission lines in its spectrum ( such a relation is usually called a `` calibration '' ) .",
    "different calibrations were suggested .",
    "a prominent characteristic of the calibrations is that they are not applicable across the whole range of metallicities of hii regions but only within a limited interval ( usually only at high or at low metallicities ) .",
    "the oxygen abundances of irregular galaxies typically lie within or near the transition zone in the @xmath7  o / h diagram ( from 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath107.9 to @xmath108.3 ) where calibrations can not be used or where they provide abundances with large uncertainties .",
    "we recently suggested a new method ( the `` c method '' ) for abundance determinations in hii regions , which can be used over the whole range of metallicities of hii regions and which provides oxygen and nitrogen abundances on the same metallicity scale as the classic @xmath1 method @xcite . using this method , we examined the abundance gradients in the disks of 130 late - type galaxies including several irregular galaxies @xcite .",
    "in that study , radial abundance gradients were found in irregular galaxies . here we will focus on the investigation of the abundance gradients in a sample of irregular galaxies ( _ sm _ and _ i m _ , morphological @xmath0 types 9 and 10 ) . since there is a relation between oxygen abundance and disk surface brightness in spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , we will also examine the relation between radial abundance distributions and surface brightness profiles of the disks of irregular galaxies .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the spectral and photometric data are reported in section 2 .",
    "the radial abundance gradients are determined in section 3 .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are given in section 4 , followed by a summary ( section 5 ) .",
    "we have selected a sample of irregular _ sm _ and _ i m _ and galaxies with morphological @xmath0 types of 9 and 10 according to the rc3 catalog @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the morphological classification of some galaxies is not robust .",
    "the morphological @xmath0 types in different sources can differ by up to 1 .",
    "we only consider irregular galaxies with available spectra for four and more hii regions .",
    "the validity of the radial abundance is defined not only by the quantity and quality of the spectra but also by the distribution of the measured hii regions along the galactic radius .",
    "we reject galaxies where the measured hii regions cover less than @xmath10  1/3 of the optical radius of a galaxy .",
    "for example , for this reason we rejected the galaxy ugc  5666 ( a.k.a.ic  2574 or ddo  81 ) .",

    "ii ) _ there is a difference between radial abundance gradients in irregular galaxies with steep and flat inner photometric profiles with a probability higher than 90% .    it should be noted that here the abundances are determined through the @xmath2 and @xmath1 methods .",
    "the @xmath2 method is based on the abundances derived via the @xmath46 method and , consequently , produces the abundances on the same metallicity scale as the @xmath46 method . if the abundances derived using the @xmath46 method are not correct for some reason ( e.g. , because of small - scale temperature fluctuations within an hii region @xcite , or if the energies of the electrons in an hii region do not follow a maxwell distribution @xcite ) then our abundances should be revised .",
    "furthermore , the absolute metallicity scale of hii regions varies up to @xmath100.7 dex depending on the calibration used @xcite .",
    "as was noted above , a prominent characteristic of the previous calibrations is that they are not applicable across the whole range of metallicities of hii regions but only within a limited interval .",
    "the oxygen abundances of irregular galaxies typically are within or near the transition zone in the @xmath7  o / h diagram where previous calibrations can not be used or where they provide abundances with large uncertainties .",
    "therefore the @xmath46- and @xmath2-based abundances are preferable for irregular galaxies .",
    "it is known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the radial distribution of oxygen abundances in the disk of a galaxy is controlled by the variation of the astration level ( or gas mass fraction @xmath47 ) with radius and by the mass exchange between a galaxy and the surrounding medium ( via galactic winds and/or gas infall / merging ) and between different parts of a galaxy .",
    "taking into consideration the radial variation of the astration level , one may expect that physical gradients ( expressed in dex kpc@xmath48 ) in irregular galaxies can be even steeper than those in spiral galaxies .",
    "the metallicities in irregular galaxies are typically lower than the ones in spiral galaxies since irregular galaxies are less massive and less evolved .",
    "the simple model for the chemical evolution of galaxies predicts that the oxygen abundance o / h varies with gas mass fraction @xmath47 more strongly at low metallicity .",
    "thus a similar change of @xmath47 along the radial direction would result in a larger change of o / h in irregular galaxies than in spiral galaxies .",
    "radial mixing of gas flattens the abundance gradient in the disk of a galaxy .",
    "radial mixing of gas can be caused by interacting or merging galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and by galactic fountains ( galactic winds and subsequent gas infall ) .",
    "the arguments pro and contra galactic wind - dominated evolution of irregular galaxies are discussed in many studies devoted to the chemical evolution of galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) .",
    "a galactic wind can be caused by the injection of energy by multiple , spatially and temporally clustered supernovae in a galaxy undergoing a starburst @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the galactic winds depends on the number of massive stars that are progenitors of supernovae in a star formation event .",
    "@xcite found that continuous , steady star formation dominates in the present epoch in dwarf galaxies .",
    "only @xmath49% of low - mass galaxies experience strong star formation bursts .",
    "the fraction of stars formed in starbursts is @xmath50% .",
    "however , it is not clear whether a strong star formation burst can occur with equal probability in every galaxy or whether a starburst happens only in a particular subset of galaxies .",
    "thus , we can interpret our results in the following manner .",
    "irregular galaxies with steep inner profiles do not seem to undergo strong radial mixing of gas at the present epoch and show considerable radial abundance gradients .",
    "the radial mixing of gas ( through radial flows or galactic fountains ) took place in irregular galaxies with flat inner profiles , resulting in shallower ( if any ) gradients as compared to the galaxies with steep inner profiles .",
    "it should be noted that the physical reason for different radial profile types is still a mystery .",
    "it is not even clear why there is an exponential drop - off of the brightness profile @xcite .",
    "we determined the abundance distributions traced by hii regions and compare their shape with the surface brightness profiles of the disks of fourteen irregular _ sm _ and _ i m _ galaxies ( morphological @xmath0 types of @xmath0 = 9 and @xmath0 = 10 ) .",
    "we used the emission line intensities in published spectra of hii regions from different studies to infer the abundances .",
    "the oxygen ( o / h)@xmath30 and nitrogen ( n / h)@xmath30 abundances in the hii regions with the detected auroral line [ oiii]@xmath64363 were determined using the equations of the classic @xmath1-method . in the other hii regions , oxygen ( o / h)@xmath29 and nitrogen ( n / h)@xmath29 abundances were obtained through the @xmath2 method .",
    "we then quantified the values of the gradients of the radial abundance profiles .",
    "moreover , we constructed radial surface brightness profiles in the infrared @xmath35 wise band and in the sdss @xmath33 and @xmath34 bands using the publicly available photometric maps .",
    "the irregular galaxies of our sample can be divided into two types according to the shapes of their surface brightness profiles : those with steep inner profiles , and those with flat inner profiles .",
    "we find that there is a correspondence between the radial abundance gradient in an irregular galaxy and its surface brightness profile with a probability higher than 90% .",
    "irregular galaxies with steep inner profiles usually show a considerable radial abundance gradient .",
    "irregular galaxies with flat inner surface brightness profiles have shallower gradients ( if any ) as compared to galaxies with steep inner profiles .",
    "thus , irregular galaxies with steep inner profiles show usually a pronounced radial abundance gradient that resembles that of spiral galaxies . in that sense , those irregular galaxies seem to extend the hubble sequence of spiral galaxies . in other words ,",
    "our data suggest that there is no `` spiral versus irregular dichotomy '' in terms of radial abundance gradients existing only in spiral galaxies , but not in irregulars .",
    "while irregulars have long been believed to be chemically homogeneous , our study shows that given enough measurements of nebular abundances of hii regions across a wide range of galactocentric radii , irregulars may well exhibit radial abundance gradients .",
