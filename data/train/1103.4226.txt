    "structured models have long served as a representative deterministic model used to describe the evolution of biological systems , see for instance @xcite or @xcite and references therein . in their simplest form , structured models describe the temporal evolution of a population structured by a biological parameter such as size , age or any significant _ trait _ , by means of an evolution law , which is a mass balance at the macroscopic scale .",
    "a paradigmatic example is given by the transport - fragmentation equation in cell division , that reads @xmath0    the mechanism captured by equation can be described as a mass balance equation ( see @xcite ) : the quantity of cells @xmath1 of size @xmath2 at time @xmath3 is fed by a transport term @xmath4 that accounts for growth by nutrient uptake , and each cell can split into two offsprings of the same size according to a division rate @xmath5 . supposing @xmath6 where we suppose a given model for the growth rate @xmath7 known up to a multiplicative constant @xmath8 and experimental data for @xmath9 the problem we consider here is to recover the division rate @xmath5 and the constant @xmath10",

    "the density @xmath17 is the first eigenvector , and @xmath18 the unique solution of the following eigenvalue problem @xmath19 moreover , under some supplementary conditions , this convergence occurs exponentially fast ( see @xcite ) .",

    ", this approach suffers from the limitation that knowledge on @xmath17 is postulated in an abstract and somewhat arbitrary sense , that is not genuinely related to experimental measurements .      in this paper",
    ", we propose to overcome the limitation of the deterministic inverse problems approach by assuming that we have @xmath44 data , each data being obtained from the measurement of an individual cell picked at random , after the system has evolved for a long time so that the approximation @xmath45 is valid .",

    "notice that this result , which is just a simplified version of @xcite , is valid for estimating any density , since we have only assumed to observe an @xmath70sample of @xmath60 so that this result can be considered _ per se .",
    "second , we estimate the density derivative ( up to @xmath12 ) @xmath71 , again by a kernel method with the same kernel @xmath65 as before , and select an optimal bandwidth @xmath72 given by formula similarly .",
    "this defines an estimator @xmath73 where @xmath74 is specified by , and yields an oracle inequality for @xmath75 stated in proposition [ estd ] . in the saemway as for @xmath60 this result has an interest _ per se _ and is not a direct consequence of @xcite .    from there",
    ", it only remains to find estimators of @xmath76 and @xmath10 .",
    "to that end , we make the following _ a priori _ ( but presumably reasonable ) assumption [ hypla ] on the existence of an estimator @xmath77 of @xmath78    [ hypla ] there exists some @xmath79 such that @xmath80\\big)^{1/q } < \\infty , \\qquad r_{\\lambda , n }   = \\operatorname{{\\mathbb e}}[\\hat\\lambda_n^{2q}]<\\infty.\\ ] ]    indeed , in practical cell culture experiments , one can track @xmath44 individual cells that have been picked at random through time . by looking at their evolution , it is possible to infer @xmath76 in a classical parametric way , via an estimator @xmath81 that we shall assume to possess from now on .",
