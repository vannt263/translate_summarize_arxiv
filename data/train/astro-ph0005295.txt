    "some recent inflation models ( e.g. , the hybrid inflationary scenario @xcite ) predict the `` blue '' power - spectrum of primordial density fluctuations . in turn , as is well known , the significant abundance of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) is possible just in the case when the density fluctuations have an @xmath0 spectrum ( @xmath1 is the spectral index of the initial density fluctuations , @xmath0 spectrum is , by definition , the `` blue perturbation spectrum '' ) .    particle emission from pbhs due to the evaporation process predicted by hawking @xcite may lead to observable effects . up to now , pbhs have not been detected , so the observations have set limits on the initial pbh abundance or on characteristics of a spectrum of the primordial density fluctuations .",
    "in particular , pbh evaporations contribute to the extragalactic neutrino background .",
    "the constraints on an intensity of this background ( and , correspondingly , on an pbh abundance ) can be obtained from the existing experiments with atmospheric and solar neutrinos .",
    "the obtaining of such constraints is a main task of the present paper .    the spectrum and the intensity of the evaporated neutrinos depend heavily on the pbh s mass .",
    "therefore , the great attention should be paid to the calculation of the initial mass spectrum of pbhs .",
    "we use in this paper the following assumptions leading to a prediction of the pbh s mass spectrum .",
    "the formation of pbhs begins only after an inflation phase when the universe returns to the ordinary radiation - dominated era .",
    "the reheating process is such that an equation of state of the universe changes almost instantaneously into the radiation type ( e.g. , due to the parametric resonance @xcite ) after the inflation .",
    "\\2 . it is assumed , in accordance with analytic calculations @xcite that a critical size of the density contrast needed for the pbh formation , @xmath2 , is about @xmath3 .",
    "further , it is assumed that all pbhs have mass roughly equal to the horizon mass at a moment of the formation , independently of the perturbation size .",
    "summation over all epochs of the pbh formation can be done using the press - schechter formalism @xcite .",
    "this formalism is widely used in the standard hierarchial model of the structure formation for calculations of the mass distribution functions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown recently that near the threshold of a black hole formation the gravitational collapse behaves as a critical phenomenon @xcite . in this case",
    "the initial mass function will be quite different from that follows from the standard calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite.the first calculations of the pbh initial mass function ( e.g. , in ref.@xcite ) have been done under the assumption that all pbhs form at the same horizon mass ( by other words , that all pbhs form at the smallest horizon scale immediatly after reheating ) .",
    "the initial pbh mass spectrum for the case of the critical collapse , based on the press - schechter formalism , was obtained in the recent work @xcite .",
    "the calculations in the present paper are based on the standard @xcite picture of the gravitational collapse leading to a pbh formation .",
    "the case of the critical collapse will be considered in a separate work .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .    in sec.[sec :",

    "the final expression is presented in a form , which is valid for an arbitrary relation between three physical values : the initial pbh mass , the fluctuation mass ( i.e. , the mass of the perturbed region ) at a moment of the collapse , and the density contrast in the perturbed region ( also at a moment of the collapse ) .",

    "we do not use cosmological models of the inflation and of the spectrum of primordial fluctuations , so there are two free parameters : the reheating temperature and the spectral index . at the end of the section ,",

    "<S> we calculated the energy spectra and the fluxes of electron neutrinos emitted in the process of the evaporation of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> it was assumed that pbhs are formed by a blue power - law spectrum of primordial density fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained the bounds on the spectral index of density fluctuations assuming validity of the standard picture of gravitational collapse and using the available data of several experiments with atmospheric and solar neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of our results with the previous constraints ( which had been obtained using diffuse photon background data ) shows that such bounds are quite sensitive to an assumed form of the initial pbh mass function . </S>"
