    "gw librae was known as an ordinary low accretion rate dwarf nova with infrequent large amplitude outbursts ( gonzalez & maza 1983 ) and a very short orbital period of 76.78 min ( thorstensen et al .",
    "2002 ) until it became highlighted as the first accreting white dwarf in a cataclysmic variable to show non - radial pulsations ( warner & van zyl 1998 ) .",
    "further monitoring at quiescence over several years revealed relatively stable pulsations at 648 , 376 and 236 s ( van zyl et al . 2000 , 2004 ) and",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) ultraviolet observations showed the same periods with higher amplitudes ( szkody et al .",
    "2002 ) , consistent with the source of the variation being modulation of the temperature of the white dwarf photosphere ( robinson et al .",
    "the temperature of the white dwarf in gw lib at quiescence was determined from the hst spectra to be near 15,000 k ( for log g=8 ) .",
    "although this temperature is outside the normal instability strip for zz ceti pulsators with a pure hydrogen atmosphere , it is within the instability strip(s ) for accreting white dwarf pulsators that have an atmosphere with a solar composition ( arras et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in 2007 april , gw lib underwent a second outburst of 9 mag ( templeton et al .",
    "2007 ) , the largest known for any dwarf nova .",
    "subsequent optical and ultraviolet observations have provided a long term record of the impact of this large outburst amplitude on the white dwarf .",
    "the heating / cooling and its effect on the white dwarf pulsations have now been followed for 8 years .",
    "ground based optical observations were available over most years ( copperwheat et al .",
    "2009 , schwieterman et al .",
    "2010 , bullock et al .",
    "2011 , vican et al .",
    "2011 , szkody et al .",
    "2012 , chote & sullivan 2016 ) , and the ultraviolet monitoring took place with @xmath0 in 2007 - 2010 ( bullock et al .",
    "2011 ) and with hst in 2010 , 2011 ( szkody et al . 2012 ) and 2013 ( toloza et al .",
    "both of these wavelength regions showed some interesting and surprising results .    in the optical , a period of 296 s",
    "was marginally detected on one night in 2008 june ( copperwheat et al .",
    "2009 ) at the 10 millimodulation amplitude ( mma ) level . the next time",
    "this short period ( 280 - 290 s ) was seen was in optical data obtained in 2010 march , 2011 april , and 2012 may ( szkody et al . 2012 , chote & sullivan 2016 ) with amplitudes of 9 mma and in hst ultraviolet data in 2010 march and 2011 april with amplitudes of 20 and 50 mma respectively . strong signals ( 25 mma ) at 19 minutes were evident in optical data taken by several groups throughout 2008 mar - july but then this period disappeared until reappearance in 2012 apr - june ( chote & sullivan 2016 ) at the 50 mma level .",
    "an even longer period at about 2 hr was identified prior to outburst ( woudt & warner 2002 , copperwheat et al 2009 , hilton et al . 2007 ) , and strong modulations at periods of 3 - 4 hr were observed after outburst in both optical and @xmath0 uv data ( schwieterman et al .",
    "2010 , bullock et al .",
    "2011 , vican et al .",
    "2011 , chote & sullivan 2016 , toloza et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "the temperature of the white dwarf as determined from hst spectra are a function of the gravity ( mass ) assumed .",
    "recently , toloza et al . (",
    "2016 ) reanalyzed all the available hst spectra of gw lib using a common log g=8.35 , which is consistent with the most recent mass estimates of 0.8 m@xmath1 ( van spaandonk et al .",
    "2010 , szkody et al .",
    "they obtained values of 14,695 k from the 2002 quiescent data , and 17,980 k in 2010 , and 15,915 k in 2011 for the 3 and 4 year post - outburst data .",
    "each of these values showed a 500 k variation in temperature in spectra phased at the peak versus the troughs of the short period pulsations that were present .",
    "surprisingly , the three orbits of hst data in 2013 showed much larger changes in flux ( a factor of 2 ) and temperature ( 15,975 - 18,966 k ) , with a mean temperature ( 16937 k ) larger than the 2011 data .",
    "the large flux changes appeared to be related to the 4 hr variability that was evident at that time .    in order to continue to monitor gw lib during its return to quiescence",
    ", we obtained further hst and optical observations in 2015 .",
    "once the hst date was set , ground - based observations were coordinated with nights before and during the observation .",
    "the observations obtained are summarized in table 1 .",
    "three hst orbits on april 21 were used to collect data with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) using the g140l grating in time - tag mode .",
    "useful spectra were obtained from 1130 - 2020 , with a resolution of about 0.75 .",
    "light curves were created by summing the fluxes over all the continuum wavelengths in this range in 5 s bins , leaving out the strong geocoronal emission line of ly@xmath2 and the strong civ emission line from gw lib .",
    "these light curves were then divided by the mean and one was subtracted so that a fractional amplitude scale was produced that could be used for discrete fourier transform ( dft ) period analysis .",
    "the amount of noise was determined by a shuffling technique to find a 3@xmath3 limit ( see szkody et al .",
    "2012 for further details ) .",
    "the american association of variable star obervers ( aavso ) posted alerts and monitored the optical brightness prior to the hst observations to ensure the system remained at quiescence .",
    "the mean magnitude during april was 16.7 .",
    "optical photometry was accomplished on apr 21 and 22 using the 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ) and the 1 m telescope at the university of canterbury mt .",
    "john observatory ( ucmjo ) .",
    "instruments at both places incorporated similar frame transfer ccds with negligible time lost to readout , and a bg-40 broad band blue filter : agile at apo ( mukadam et al . 2011 ) and puoko - nui at ucmjo ( chote et al .",
    "cloudy weather resulted in lower quality data at apo on apr 22 compared with apr 21 .",
    "the apo optical reductions were accomplished using standard iraf routines to extract sky - subtracted light curves from the ccd frames using weighted circular aperture photometry ( odonoghue et al .",
    "2000 ) . for the short period analysis of the apo data ,",
    "the light curves were converted to fractional amplitude in the same manner as for the hst data .",
    "the ucmjo data utilized the reduction pipeline tsreduce described in chote et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .",
    "spectra were obtained on 2015 april 21 using the double imaging spectrograph ( dis ) at apo .",
    "the high resolution grating was used to provide simultaneous blue and red spectral coverage with a resolution of 0.6  pixel@xmath4 for blue wavelengths of 4000 - 5000  and red wavelengths of 6000 - 7200 .",
    "flux standards and henear lamps were used for calibration and the iraf tasks under @xmath5 and @xmath6 were used to correct the images , extract the spectra to 1-d and calibrate them .",
    "figure 1 shows the average spectrum from the three hst orbits in 2015 overplotted on the average of the three orbits from 2013 .",
    "these average spectra separated by two years are very similar . using the same procedure to fit the average spectrum in 2015 as done for all the previous data ( toloza et al .",
    "2016 ) results in a mean temperature of 17560@xmath79 k. this implies that the white dwarf has still not returned to quiescence eight years after its outburst .",
    "the optical spectrum obtained 24 hrs prior to the hst spectra is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the overall spectral shape is similar to the quiescent spectra taken with the same spectrograph ( szkody , desai & hoard 2000 ) while the blue fluxes are between the quiescent values and those obtained in 2010 ( szkody et al .",
    "the fwzi of h@xmath8 ( 20 ) is wider while the equivalent width ( 18 ) is smaller than quiescent values , numbers that are consistent with a higher temperature white dwarf and a larger contribution from the inner higher velocity disk regions .",
    "the optical light curves from apo , ucmjo and the aavso , as well as the uv light curve constructed from the hst spectra are shown in figure 3 .",
    "constants were added to the magnitudes of the apo , ucmjo and hst light curves to bring them all to the approximate aavso magnitude for each night .",
    "the optical data show a consistent 20% amplitude modulation at 2 hr that persists from the preceding night through the time of the hst observations .",
    "while the uv shows a mean change of about 10% over the 3 orbits , the times of peak optical flux unfortunately did not fall into the hst observation windows .",
    "thus , it is impossible to tell if the large increase seen in the 2013 uv data existed in 2015 .",
    "however , the length of the large uv flux increase in 2013 was at least 100 min and the gaps in the 2015 data are only about 50 min so some increase should have been visible if the same phenomenon was present .",
    "the optical and especially the uv light curves do show the presence of a shorter timescale variation .",
    "the dft results are shown in figure 4 for the uv data and figures 5 and 6 for the apo data obtained on apr 21 and simultaneous with hst on apr 22 .",
    "all datasets show a significant period between 364 - 373 s , one of the periods that is visible before the 2007 outburst .",
    "the uv / optical amplitude ratio is 100/15 = 6.7 , a similar ratio to that observed at quiescence for the 376 s period ( szkody et al .",
    "prior studies have addressed the question of the origin of the three main periodicities visible after the outburst .",
    "while the short 280 - 370 s periods are usually ascribed to a non - radial pulsation mode , the origin of the intermittent longer periods at 19 min and 2 - 4 hr have been harder to interpret as due to pulsations or quasi - periodic oscillations of the accretion disk .",
    "the chote & sullivan ( 2016 ) observations obtained over a timescale of 3 months in 2012 and their interpretation support a pulsation mode for the 19 min period .",
    "their arguments hinge on the similarity of the period between 2008 and its return in 2012 , and the similarity of the behavior of the period ( amplitude modulation and slight frequency shifts ) to that seen in cool dav stars ( kleinman et al .",
    "1998 ) and to the flare events that repeat every few days in dav white dwarfs recently reported by bell et al .",
    "( 2015 ) and hermes et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .",
    "toloza et al .",
    "( 2016 ) also argue that the 2 - 4 hr modulation that appears and disappears is related to pulsations .",
    "they fit the large amplitude of the variation with an increase in the temperature of the white dwarf over a fraction of the white dwarf surface .",
    "they speculate this variation could be caused by a splitting of the g - modes due to the rapid rotation of the white dwarf in gw lib ( 200 s , szkody et al .",
    "2012 ) , that results in a travelling wave moving counter to the rotation . in both cases ,",
    "the similarity of the periods when they are present , yet the lack of a regular recurrence time rule out phenomena such as disk precession or beating between periods .    however , the theoretical details of the long period pulsations remain to be delineated .",
    "these include reasons why the 19 min period remains for months and then disappears for years , why the longest period changes from 2 hr ( woudt & warner 2002 , this work ) to 3 hr ( chote & sullivan 2016 ) to 4 hr ( bullock et al . 2011 , toloza et al .",
    "2016 ) , and why the 4 hr optical variation can disappear from one night to the next and be out of phase with the ultraviolet ( bullock et al .",
    "it is possible the changes in period may be related to the outburst and subsequent cooling .",
    "the period of 2 hr was evident prior to outburst , then it was 4 hr in 2008 - 2010 , 3 hr in 2012 and 2 hr in 2015 .",
    "our hst ultraviolet and ground - based optical coverage of gw lib 8 years after the largest known dwarf nova outburst reveals that the white dwarf has not yet reached its quiescent pre - outburst temperature .",
    "its mean temperature for the 2015 observation remains similar to what it was in 2013 , about 3000 k above its quiescent value .",
    "the ultraviolet and optical light curves both show a short period of 364 - 373 s , similar to one of the persistent periods observed during quiescence , and with a similar ratio ( 7 ) of uv / optical amplitudes . a large ( 0.2 mag peak - to - peak )",
    "modulation at a period of 2 hr is apparent in the optical light curves preceding and simultaneous with the hst data , and is coherent over these 2 nights .",
    "unfortunately , the hst observation times did not cover the peaks of the optical modulation so it is not possible to tell if , or how , the 2 hr modulation appears in the uv . neither the 19 min period that was evident in the optical in 2012 nor the large 4 hr modulation that was present in the 2013 hst data are observed .",
    "the 19 min period has yet to be seen at ultraviolet wavlengths and a much longer series of optical and ultraviolet observations will be needed to sort out the recurrence timescales and wavelength dependence of the 2 - 4 hr modulations .",
    "the return of the short and long periods to their pre - outburst values may be a signal that the white dwarf is finally returning to its quiescent configuration .",
