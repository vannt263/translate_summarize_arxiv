    "over the past few years , a lot of work has been devoted to the propagation of high energy partons ( jets ) through hot and cold qcd matter .",
    "the jet @xmath1-broadening and the gluon radiation induced by multiple scattering , together with the resulting radiative energy loss of the jet have been studied .",
    "these studies are extensions to qcd of the analogous qed problem considered long ago by landau , pomeranchuk and migdal @xcite .",
    "recent measurements @xcite ( reviewed in @xcite ) confirm the theoretical predictions in the qed case to good accuracy .",
    "as in qed , coherent suppression of the radiation spectrum takes place when a parton propagates in a qcd medium .",
    "new and interesting predictions are found . when a high energy parton traverses a length @xmath2 of hot or cold matter , the induced radiative energy loss is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "the energy loss of a high energy jet in a hot qcd plasma appears to be much larger than in cold nuclear matter even at moderate temperatures of the plasma , @xmath4 200 mev .",
    "the order of magnitude of the effect in hot matter compared to the case of cold nuclear matter may be expected to be large enough to lead to an observable and remarkable signal of the production of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "indeed , it has been proposed to measure the magnitude of `` jet quenching '' in the transverse momentum spectrum of hard jets produced in heavy ion collisions , noting that jet quenching is the manifestation of energy loss as seen in the suppression and change of shape of the jet spectrum compared with hadron data .",
    "this review is organized as follows : the case of elastic parton scattering giving rise to the collisional energy loss , especially in hot matter , is presented in section  2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we give the basic elements of the equations and describe the coherent pattern of the gluon radiative spectrum induced by multiple scattering .",
    "we derive the induced energy loss and the jet transverse momentum broadening in terms of phenomenologically significant quantities .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the path integral approach , which provides another derivation of the induced radiative spectrum . for heavy ion collisions",
    "the case of an expanding qcd plasma is more realistic , and therefore in section 5 we consider the corresponding energy loss calculation . in section 6",
    ", we investigate the angular dependence of the radiative gluon spectrum .",
    "the dependence of the energy loss on the jet cone size is analyzed .",
    "section 7 is devoted to estimates of the energy loss in hot qcd matter and in nuclear matter , and orders of magnitude are given .",
    "a noticeable result is that the energy loss in the case of a hot qcd medium is found to be quite collimated .",
    "experimental indications are shortly reviewed .",
    "we close with an outlook .",
    "the electromagnetic energy loss of a charged particle in matter is a well studied subject @xcite .",
    "similar mechanisms are responsible for the energy loss of a fast quark or gluon ( jet ) propagating through dense qcd matter .    in this section",
    "we discuss the loss caused by elastic collisions of the propagating quark or gluon off the ( light ) partons forming the dense quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in order to understand the characteristic features we consider in some detail the loss of a test quark @xmath5 traversing a plasma with quarks @xmath6 and gluons @xmath7 interacting elastically as @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite ; for a review , see @xcite .",
    "the energy loss per unit length depends on the density @xmath10 of the plasma constituents @xmath11 ( with momentum @xmath12 ) and on the differential cross section weighted by the energy transfer @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the energy of the incoming ( scattered ) @xmath5 , @xmath15 @xmath16 denotes the flux factor , @xmath17 the invariant ( four ) momentum transfer .",
    "small values of @xmath17 dominate the collisions , @xmath18 with @xmath19 for @xmath20 colors . for a qgp in thermal and chemical equilibrium",
    "the densities are given by @xmath21 in terms of the fermi - dirac ( bose - einstein ) distributions @xmath22 .",
    "although the factor @xmath23 in ( [ eq : c1 ] ) improves the rutherford singularity of ( [ eq : c2 ] ) , a logarithmic dependence still remains after the @xmath17-integration , which has to be screened by medium effects , i.e. with a cut - off related to the debye mass @xcite : @xmath24 .",
    "noting that @xmath25 ( when @xmath26 ) one obtains @xcite @xmath27 with @xmath28 a numerical constant of @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the strong coupling constant may be evaluated at the scale @xmath31 for high temperature @xmath32 .",
    "because of the @xmath33 dependence of ( [ eq : c4 ] ) it has been pointed out by bjorken @xcite that the collisional loss is proportional to @xmath34 , i.e. the square root of the qgp energy density , which in leading order in the coupling constant is given by @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "a proper and consistent treatment of the screening effects of the plasma in the low ( soft ) exchange momentum region of the collisions is indeed possible in the thermal field - theoretic framework @xcite , using resummed perturbation theory at high temperature .",
    "this method has been developed by braaten and pisarski @xcite and it allows one to calculate the hard thermal loop ( htl ) corrections to the propagator of the exchanged gluon in the @xmath8 , and the @xmath9 processes .",
    "the quantum field - theoretic calculation of the energy loss of a quark requires the evaluation of the discontinuity of the self - energy diagrams e.g. illustrated in figure [ fig : htl2 ] . for the soft momentum exchange ( with momentum less than @xmath36 )",
    "the htl gluon propagator contributes , whereas for the hard momentum exchange @xmath37 the tree - level elastic scattering ( figure [ fig : htl2]b ) contributes @xcite .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    the momentum cut - off @xmath38 drops out in the sum of soft and hard contributions .",
    "it is important to note that landau - damping effects , because of the negative @xmath17 values in ( [ eq : c1 ] ) , screen successfully the low @xmath17 region leading to a well defined result for @xmath39 ( at least to leading order in the coupling constant ) .    as an example",
    "the result is illustrated in figure [ fig : braat ] , where the energy loss of a charm quark is shown by the dashed curve using parameters characteristic for a thermalized qgp as expected in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "1truecm    for light quarks the collisional energy loss for a jet propagating in a hot medium of @xmath40 gev amounts to 0.2 - 0.3 gev / fm @xcite , in agreement with the estimates of @xcite as shown in figure [ fig : braat ] ( dotted curve ) . for a gluon jet the loss",
    "is predicted to be larger by the color factor @xmath41 than for the quark jet .",
    "since the qgp expected at rhic and lhc is likely to be out of chemical equilibrium it is necessary to investigate the energy loss in this case @xcite . indeed ,",
    "even away from chemical equilibrium , dynamical screening remains operational within the htl - resummed perturbation theory .",
    "more explicitly , the collisional energy loss for a heavy quark ( mass @xmath42 ) propagating through a qgp parametrized in terms of the distribution functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , where @xmath45 are the fugacity factors describing chemical non - equilibrium , becomes @xmath46.\\ ] ] this expression @xcite is valid for energetic quarks with @xmath47 and contains for @xmath48 the original result of @xcite .",
    "the screening mass parameter is @xmath49 for comparison the solid curve in figure [ fig : braat ] shows the loss for the interesting case of the `` early plasma phase '' which is dominated by gluons ( @xmath50 ) , where the loss is exclusively due to elastic @xmath9 scattering mediated by gluon exchange .    in summary ,",
    "even when the partons propagating in hot matter have a large momentum , the collisional energy loss per unit length turns out to be less than @xmath51 gev / fm when reasonable values for @xmath52 and @xmath32 are taken .",
    "this estimate may be compared with the value for the hadronic string tension , @xmath53 gev / fm , which measures the slowing down of a high momentum quark in ( cold ) nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "we imagine a very energetic quark of energy @xmath54 propagating through a qcd medium of finite length @xmath2 . multiple scattering of this projectile in the medium induces gluon radiation , which gives rise to the quark energy loss .",
    "the main assumption @xcite is that the scattering centers are static and uncorrelated ( in the spirit of the glauber picture ) .",
    "we thus focus on purely radiative processes since the collisional energy loss vanishes in the case of static centers .",
    "we define a normalized quark-``particle '' cross - section @xmath55    where @xmath5 is the 2-dimensional transverse momentum transfer scaled by an appropriate scale  : @xmath56    in the case of a hot qcd plasma , the `` particle '' is a quark or gluon and it is a nucleon in the case of cold matter .",
    "@xmath57 depends only on @xmath58 , as it is usually assumed for diffractive kinematics with very large incident energy .",
    "the scale @xmath59 characteristic of the medium is conveniently taken as the debye screening mass in the hot case and as a typical momentum transfer in a quark - nucleon collision .",
    "the condition that the independent scattering picture be valid may be expressed as  : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the parton mean free path in the medium @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the density of the medium . we assume that a large number of scatterings takes place , that is @xmath64    successive scatterings being independent , the parton propagation is `` time - ordered '' and time - ordered perturbation theory is the natural framework to calculate the radiation amplitude .",

    "the phase factor as it appears here may be understood in terms of formation time arguments which will be discussed heuristically in the next section .",

    "the best guiding example comes from the long - term study of hard jets in hadron - hadron scattering , starting from the first evidence at the cern - isr until the analysis of jet cross sections up to transverse momenta of @xmath442 gev at cdf and d , which has been successfully carried out within an active interplay between experiments and perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "medium effects will continue to attract increasing attention , and we hope that finally the described suppression mechanism will be demonstrated by future experiments in a convincing manner .",
    "more detailed treatments and improvements are certainly necessary in view of completing this program .",
    "it constitutes an important chapter of what has been recently designated @xcite as the `` health report '' of qcd .",
