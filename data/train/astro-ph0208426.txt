    "the random motions of stars near the sun are well known to increase with stellar age , and this effect is known as the disc age velocity relation ( hereafter avr ) . broadly speaking",
    ", the total velocity dispersion of stars rises from @xmath1220  at the lowest measurable ages to @xmath13 60 - 80  at an age of @xmath13 10 - 12 gyr .",
    "the `` heating '' of the orbits is initially rapid but levels off after some gyr .",
    "the heating is not uniform in each of the three velocity components ; the velocity dispersion rises to a higher value in the galactic plane than in the vertical direction .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the avr , in particular the gravitational perturbative effect on stellar orbits by giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in the galaxy s gas layer @xcite , by spiral arms in the disc @xcite , or by massive black holes in the galactic dark halo ( bhs ) @xcite .",
    "dramatic disc heating also takes place when satellite galaxies fall onto galactic discs @xcite , and such events may well leave an abrupt feature in the avr , but if the rain of such satellites is relatively gentle they might also heat discs smoothly @xcite .    spitzer and",
    "schwarzschild first argued that the observed growth of the stellar velocity dispersion could be explained by encounters of disc stars with gmcs with masses of @xmath14 .",
    "the main difficulty with this scenario is that the observed number of gmcs modify stellar orbits in a manner inconsistent with observations .",
    "firstly , they are too few to reproduce the observed heating , and secondly , too much heating is produced in the vertical direction relative to the disc plane @xcite .",
    "however , gmcs do exist so they certainly provide a mechanism for redirecting orbits out of the galactic plane , whatever is responsible for the heating .",
    "heating due to transient spiral arms suffers the opposite problem that the amount of vertical heating is too low compared to observations @xcite .",
    "this naturally leads to the idea that the observed heating could be explained by the combined effect of the transient spiral arms and giant molecular clouds . in this model spiral density waves",
    "would act as main source of heating and gmcs would delect the stellar orbits out of the galactic plane , thus creating the required velocity dispersion in the vertical direction @xcite .",
    "however , these calculations are rather complicated : e.g. the relative effectiveness of spiral and gmc heating has to modelled with an empirical parameter . the rate at which spiral features heat a stellar disc depends on the potential s spatial pattern and on the time variability of the pattern . in principle ,",
    "spatial stuctures of galaxies can be determined from photometry of real galaxies and temporal information about spiral stucture can be obtained from numerical simulation and dynamical theory . in practice , however , we do not have adequate information about strengths , growth rates or duty cycles of spiral features .",
    "so empirical parametrization has so far been the only possible approach @xcite .",
    "lacey and ostriker proposed that the galactic dark halo might consist of massive black holes ( bhs ) which would heat the disc as they pass through it .",
    "the total heating produced by their proposed @xmath15  black holes is consistent with observations , but the velocity ellipsoid was found to be quite round , which is inconsistent with observations .",
    "furthermore , if the dark halos of dwarf spiral galaxies were dominated by similar bhs their discs would be easily destroyed @xcite .",
    "finally , bhs passing through the disc might be expected to accrete and reveal themselves as high proper motion x - ray sources , and no such objects have been seen .",
    "it seems worth noting though that the central black hole in the milky way demonstrates that the accretion rate and emergent flux from a black hole of about the desired mass ( @xmath16 ) is far from well understood @xcite ; the central black hole in the milky way is remarkably quiet in x - rays .",
    "another way of detecting these putative black holes is by statistically studying large numbers of orbits of nearby stars ; this may be possible with very accurate distances and kinematics which will become available for stars within some kiloparsecs from esa s gaia satellite .    in order to avoid problems related to the black hole scenario carr and lacey proposed dark clusters of less massive objects .",
    "the latest generation of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation do indeed show quite clumpy dark halos around milky way type spirals @xcite .",
    "the amount , size and distribution of these clumps is still very uncertain , mainly due to numerical resolution issues , but if they can survive in the inner regions of dark halos they may well be able to heat discs in a manner consistent with observations .    with this in mind we have embarked on a new study of disc heating simulations , starting with examining heating due to gmcs and bhs .",
    "the european space agency s hipparcos satellite has provided a wealth of new data on the distances and kinematics of nearby stars , so that one can now construct very much improved measurements of ages and kinematics .",
    "the velocities of the stars are much improved through the excellent hipparcos parallaxes , while the ages of stars can be much better estimated , particularly for stars near the disc main sequence turn - off , because of the greatly improved absolute magnitudes .",
    "ideally , one would like to carry out a self - consistent n - body simulation of an entire disc galaxy , with and without the perturbing influences due to gmcs / bhs etc , but this is not yet possible even with the fastest computers .",
    "the computation would involve both the stars ( at approx 1 ) and the perturbers ( for a range of masses , @xmath17-@xmath11 ) , implying some @xmath18 stars and thousands of gmcs to millions of bhs in the simulations .",
    "this is not yet feasible in an n - body simulation . in this paper",
    "we render the problem tractable by simulating the heating in a local patch of the galactic disc consisting typically of few tens of thousands of ( massless ) tracer stars , embedded within a fixed galactic background potential , through which massive perturbers move . by using a local simulation method",
    "we can resolve very well the effects of perturbers on nearby stellar orbits , for comparison with the locally obtained observations .",
    "a very similar method has been used by fuchs et al . who studied disc heating due to gmcs and/or @xmath19 black holes .",
    "we are able to broadly reproduce the results of their code in this area , but we also explore a larger range of scenarios .    from our simulations , we find that gmc heating is less effective than earlier thought and further that heating due to gmcs creates a flatter velocity ellipsoid than found in earlier studies .",
    "we find that bhs are not as effective in heating the disc as earlier thought .",
    "however , very massive halo black holes ( @xmath20 ) can heat the disc up to the observed amount , but the results of the heating rate and the ratio of the velocity dispersions are only marginally consistent with observations .",
    "a well selected combination of bhs and gmcs can give the observed heating in every component of the velocity dispersion within the observational error limits , but while interesting this solution is probably ad hoc , as the simulations do not yet model the effects of other perturbation sources , such as spiral waves .",
    "this will be examined in future work .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we review pre- and post - hipparcos work on the observational determination of the age - velocity relation ( avr ) for the local disc .",
    "we find the avr is much less well measured than has previously been assumed .",
    "observational issues thus still fundamentally limit our ability to discriminate between disc heating mechanisms . in section 3",
    "we describe briefly our simulation method and numerical accuracy . in sections 4 , 5 , and 6",
    "we demonstrate how massive perturbes ( gmcs and halo bhs ) heat up the stellar disc .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section 7 .",
    "the hipparcos satellite measured parallaxes and space motions for a complete sky coverage of about 60,000 stars , with a further 60,000 stars assembled from a variety of pre - existing sources . as a result , the kinematics of stars used to construct the relationship between mean stellar age and the components of the velocity dispersion ( the age - velocity relation , avr ) have been greatly improved .",
    "we briefly review here the state of the observational avr both pre - hipparcos and post - hipparcos .",
    "figure 1(a ) , shows several determinations of the avr from the literature .",
    "we divide the measurements into pre - hipparcos and post - hipparcos determinations .",
    "each avr presented and the simulation results has been fit with the following form    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the total velocity dispersion as a function of time , @xmath2 , @xmath23 is the initial velocity dispersion at @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a constant with unit of time , and @xmath3 is the heating index @xcite . our motivation here is to fit the data with a simple analytical law which can also be fit to the simulations .",
    "firstly , consider the pre - hipparcos measurements of the avr , which are shown in panel @xmath26 of figure 1 .",
    "edvardsson et al s data set of accurately determined ages for 189 f and g stars is shown by crosses .",
    "wielen s determination , based mainly on k and m dwarfs which have been ranked by age based on chromospheric emission line measurements , is shown by squares .",
    "an improved version of the data set @xcite is shown by triangles .",
    "these latter data sets are mostly m dwarf types , for which the kinematical and parallax measurements have only been marginally improved by hipparcos , and they remain robust in the post - hipparcos epoch .",
    "we have fit each data set to eqn [ fit ] , using a non - linear least squares gradient - expansion algorithm ( using the idl software package ) .",
    "all data points were given equal weight .",
    "for these three data sets , we find heating indices @xmath3 in the range 0.47 to 0.61 ( see table 1 ) .",
    ".values of the heating index obtained by fitting data in the literature .",
    "the first five rows show our fits , and the last two show the author s own reported values .",
    "note that holmberg ( 2001 ) removes the effect of higher velocity thick disc stars when making his ( more reliable ) estimate of the heating index , whereas we leave them in ( in order to estimate the bias they impose ) .",
    "there is a very considerable range in the derived values of @xmath3 , which far exceeds the reported ( internal ) error estimates ; @xmath3 is therefore very likely to be dominated by systematic errors in the methods used to estimate stellar ages . [",

    "[ fig5a ] epsf = 0.9    in order to test the combined effects of the gmcs and halo black holes on the disc heating we performed two further sets of simulations . we know",
    "approximately the number density of the giant molecular clouds in the solar neighbourhood , but none of the parameters related to the possible black hole population are directly known , except for the local density of the dark halo .",
    "the simulations seen in figure 8 differ only by the number density and mass of the halo black holes . in the run of @xmath27 the number density of the black holes",
    "is @xmath28 corresponding to @xmath29 . in this scenario",
    "most of the halo would thus consist of black holes .",
    "the combined effect of these black holes and gmcs would be enough to heat the disc to @xmath30 in 12 gyr ( filled circles in figure 8(a ) ) , which is somewhat less than what is actually observed ( however , see also dehnen & binney who report a maximum velcocity dispersion @xmath31 for the oldest stellar population ) .",
    "the growth of the velocity dispersion is now intermediate between the pure black hole and the gmc cases alone , @xmath32 .",
    "the ratio of the vertical and radial components of the velocity dispersion is plotted in figure 8(b ) . in this case (",
    "filled circles ) the ratio is around @xmath33 after @xmath34 gyr .",
    "this value fits well within observational error .",
    "the open circles in figure 8 show the simulation with halo black holes of mass @xmath35 , and a number density of @xmath36 which corresponds to @xmath37 .",
    "we can reproduce the disc heating very nicely with this setup , with the velocity dispersion rising to @xmath38 over 12 gyr , very similar to the observations .",
    "the fitted heating law is within the observational limits at @xmath39 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath40 is about 0.63 , which is also within the observational error limits .",
    "it is interesting to note the high @xmath40 ratios that the combined perturbations of bhs and gmcs produce .",
    "why is the @xmath41 ratio not somewhere between the values obtained from the simulations in which bhs and gmcs act alone ?",
    "the answer lies in the fact that @xmath41 ratio has a tendancy to grow when the number of perturbers is increased , as seen in both the gmc and bh simulation sets .",
    "when we increase the total number of perturbers , even if some of them are bhs and some gmcs , the @xmath40 ratio is bound to increase .",
    "there is firm observational evidence for the heating of the stellar disc with time .",
    "we have assembled the available post - hipparcos samples of ages and kinematics for nearby stars and fit a heating law of the form @xmath42 to the data , where @xmath1 is the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "the observational data limit @xmath3 to values between about @xmath43 and @xmath44 , i.e. despite the recent advances in measuring the kinematics and ages of nearby stars due to the availablity of hipparcos data , the age velocity relation in the nearby disc remains poorly determined .",
    "fortunately , the ratio of the vertical component of the velocity dispersion to the radial component @xmath45 is much better constrained by available data and can be used to test our simulations .",
    "we simulate disc heating by modelling a patch of the galactic disc populated with tracer stars .",
    "we examine the effect of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) travelling on disc orbits through the patch , and of massive black holes travelling through on plunging orbits characteristic of the dark halo .    in our simulations of gmc heating",
    "we consistently find slightly lower values for @xmath3 than earlier studies have found , which are based on either theoretical estimates of the diffusion rate of stellar orbits , or scaled simulations of the whole galactic disc ( with a small number of gmcs ) .",
    "we find @xmath46 for the evolution of the total velocity dispersion and @xmath47 for the evolution of the vertical component of the velocity dispersion .",
    "the ratio @xmath40 of heating in the vertical and horizontal directions in the disc is found to depend on the adopted gmc density .",
    "the observed heating can not be explained by gmcs , because even a four - fold gmc number density compared to the present day value in the solar neighbourhood , @xmath48 @xcite , does not heat up the disc enough .",
    "however , coincidentally we find that for the present day gmc number density the ratio @xmath49 which is consistent within the observational limits for stars in the local disc .",
    "we have also run simulations of the local disc heating being caused by massive ( @xmath50-@xmath11 ) black holes of the dark halo penetrating the disc and perturbing the stellar orbits .",
    "our simulations verify analytically obtained results in the literature , that the heating index is of order @xmath51 .",
    "even if the entire halo consisted of @xmath27 black holes , the resulting heating of the stellar disc would be much less than what is observed .",
    "however , if the whole halo were comprised of black holes of order @xmath20 the disc would be heated sufficiently .",
    "they would heat the disc in such a way that the ratio @xmath40 would increase from @xmath52 to @xmath44 which is still within the error limits of the observations .",
    "we have examined how the stellar disc would be heated by the combination of gmcs and halo black holes .",
    "adopting a gmc density consistent with the present observed value and a dark halo comprised of @xmath27 black holes would only heat the disc up to @xmath31 in 12 gyr , which is inconsistent with most of the observations . on the other hand ,",
    "if half of the halo were made of @xmath20 black holes , they could with the gmcs heat the disc up to @xmath38 in 12 gyr , which is consistent with observations , but the heating would also push the ratio of the vertical velocity dispersion to the horizontal dispersion higher : @xmath53 , which is still barely within the observational limits . in this case",
    "the heating index was observed to be @xmath39 .",
    "taking into account the observational uncertainties in the stellar disc heating we can produce the right amount of the heating by a proper combination of massive halo black holes , @xmath20 , and the right number density of gmcs in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "also the ratio @xmath41 and the heating index @xmath3 fall within observational error limits .",
    "we do not regard this as a particularly satisfactory solution , because there are other potential causes of heating of stellar orbits , such as spiral arms , which we plan to investigate further in the simulation method presented here .",
    "we are grateful to burkhard fuchs , johan holmberg , heikki salo , jesper sommer - larsen , alexandr myllri and helio rocha - pinto for valuable discussions .",
    "we thank the academy of finland for supporting this work , through its support of the antares space research program ."
