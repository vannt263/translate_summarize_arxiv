    "the concept of the structure of the photon has appeared more then 30 years ago and is still very important phenomenological tool for analyzing processes involving photons .",
    "it is based on the fact that photon fluctuate into various states consisting of leptons , quarks , w@xmath1 bosons etc . through the primary splitting    @xmath2    followed by subsequent interactions of the @xmath3 pair , the hadronic structure of the photon in the perturbative qcd can be revealed .",
    "this structure can be described , similarly as for the case of nucleon , in terms of parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , satisfying dglap evolution equations . however , for the photon these equations differ from those of nucleon one by the presence of inhomogeneous terms which are the direct consequence of ( [ gamma->qq ] ) .",
    "this inhomogeneity has important implications for the qcd analysis of @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , one has to be careful in the interpretation of the order of qcd approximation of physical quantities , like @xmath5 , involving pdf of the photon .",
    "the way of handling this problem in most of analyses of structure function @xmath0 , which we call the conventional approach , has been critically discussed in @xcite and the alternative one was proposed . according to @xcite , the main source of the confusion concerning the qcd analysis of @xmath4 stems from the definition of what the leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) means in the context of photonic interactions . as a result , the conventional approach mixes purely qed effects with those of qcd origin .",
    "the alternative approach , compared to the conventional one , includes at each fixed order of qcd a few additional quantities . in lo the complete analysis in this approach can be performed because all required quantities are known . in nlo",
    "all but one of these quantities are known but even the remaining can in principle be derived from the known calculations @xcite .",
    "the work on this is in progress @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we extend the alternative approach to the case of full @xmath5 and present detailed numerical results . in particular , we emphasize the numerical importance of all additional terms as well as the overall difference between these two approaches and show that this difference is phenomenologically relevant and comparable with errors of the existing data .",
    "finally we present the global analysis of @xmath4 based on the model of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the basic facts concerning pdf of the photon are recalled , followed in section 3 by discussion of the qcd analysis of the structure function @xmath0 at the lo and nlo . in section 4 numerical comparison of the conventional and the alternative approaches to the qcd analysis of @xmath0 at the lo is performed , followed in section 5 by results of the global fits in @xmath6 model and the conclusion in section 6 .",
    "similarly as for nucleous , we can introduce the so - called `` dressed '' photonic pdfs , which result from the resummation of multiparton collinear emission from the corresponding `` bare '' parton distribution . as a result , photonic pdfs acquire dependence on the factorization scale m. this dependence is determined by the system of coupled inhomogeneous evolution equations    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and the inhomogeneous terms @xmath9 a @xmath10 result from ( [ gamma->qq ] ) and qcd corrections to it .",
    "the non - singlet and the singlet distribution functions are defined as : @xmath11,\\nonumber\\\\ q^\\gamma_{ns}(x , m)=\\sum_f(e_i^2-\\langle e^2 \\rangle ) ( q^\\gamma_f(x , m)+\\bar{q}^\\gamma_f(x , m))\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where _ f _ runs over all active massless quark flavors .    to order @xmath12 the photon - parton splitting functions @xmath13 and the purely hadronic splitting functions @xmath14 in eq .",

    "the coupling constant @xmath20 satisfies the rg equation : @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 . to the nlo , the solution of the equation ( [ rge ] )",
    "can be approximated in the form : @xmath24 equation ( [ rge ] ) has infinite number of solutions which can be parameterized by the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the choice of @xmath25 then specifies a particular solution of ( [ rge ] ) .",
    "the general solution of the evolution equations ( [ dglap ] ) can be written as the sum    @xmath26    of general solution of the corresponding homogeneous equations , called hadronic , and particular solution of the full inhomogeneous equations for which we can take the so - called pointlike solution which results from the resumation of contributions to the pure qed coupling @xmath27 where one gluon , two gluons etc . are emitted . in the non - singlet case",
    "the diagrams like those in fig .",
    "[ qpointlike ] are ressummed :    @xmath28        the evolution equations ( [ dglap ] ) can not be solved analytically in @xmath29-space and one has to use numerical methods .",
    "one of them is based on the mellin transform :    @xmath30    which converts the equations ( [ dglap ] ) into much simpler ones : @xmath31 evolution equations ( [ pdfn_1])-([pdfn_3 ] ) are solvable analytically . in the non - singlet case , taking into account only @xmath32 and @xmath33 we get @xcite :    @xmath34    adding also @xmath35 and @xmath36 we find : @xmath37\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(m)}{\\alpha_s(m_0 ) } \\right)^{1 - 2p_{qq}^{(0)}(n)/\\beta_{0 } } \\right]a \\nonumber\\\\ \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!&+\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(m)}{\\alpha_s(m_0 ) } \\right)^{-2p_{qq}^{(0)}(n)/\\beta_{0 } } \\right]\\frac{1}{-p_{qq}^{(0)}(n)}\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi}\\left[k^{(1)}(n)-\\frac{\\beta_1}{2\\beta_0}k^{(0)}(n)-u_{ns}k^{(0)}(n ) \\right ] , \\label{pl_nlo}\\\\ \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!&q^{\\gamma , had}_{ns}(n , m)= \\left\\lbrace 1+\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(m)}{2 \\pi}-\\frac{\\alpha_s(m_0)}{2 \\pi}\\right)u_{ns}\\right\\rbrace \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(m)}{\\alpha_s(m_0)}\\right)^{-2p^{(0)}_{qq}(n)/\\beta_0}q^{\\gamma , had}(n , m_0 ) \\nonumber \\label{had_nlo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is now given by equation ( [ rge ] ) , where we keep terms proportional to @xmath38 and @xmath39 and    @xmath40    in the flavor singlet case the above formulae become more complicated because @xmath33 , @xmath36 , and consequently also @xmath41 are the 2x2 matrices . for more details",
    "next step is to transform the distribution function from the mellin moments back to the @xmath29-space .",
    "this inverse mellin transformation can be done by integration in the complex plane :    @xmath42    where the integration path lies to the right of the right - most singularity of f(n ) .",
    "if the function @xmath43 is real the above formula may be simplified as :    @xmath44    to solve dglap evolution equations requires the specification of the boundary conditions which contain information on x - dependence of the photonic pdfs at some arbitrary initial scale @xmath45 .",
    "this boundary conditions are usually parameterized by a set of parameters which are determined by the comparison with experimental data .",
    "another parameter which have to be chosen is a real parameter @xmath46 . as is seen from ( [ inverse_mellin_1 ] )",
    ", it determines the position of the integral path on real axis .",
    "in fact , such a choice is arbitrary if @xmath46 lies right to the most - right singularity and the integral path runs upwards to infinity , but this is no more true if we solve this integral numerically .",
    "in such a case the optimal shape and position together with the upper limit of the integration have to be chosen in order to satisfy the requirements of the accurancy or / and computation time .",
    "with the explicit solutions for the photonic parton distributions @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 at hand it is now straightforward to obtain the photon structure function @xmath50 given as ( in the rest of the text we set @xmath51 ) @xmath52 where the coefficient functions @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 entering the @xmath0 in convolution with the photon distributions admit the following perturbative expansions @xmath56 the coefficient functions @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be found in . in order to compute the structure function @xmath0 to the desired order of qcd one has to provide photonic pdfs and coefficient functions to corresponding order of perturbative qcd .",
    "we find that in the pointlike solution ( [ pl_lo ] ) the qcd coupling constant @xmath20 appears in the denominator .",
    "if we take this fact literally i.e. as meaning that the lowest order of pqcd pointlike parts of the photonic distribution functions behave like ( @xmath60 ) , we conclude that :    * at the lo the structure function @xmath0 is related to the distribution functions in the same way as in the hadronic case : + @xmath61 + where non - singlet and singlet distribution functions satisfy evolution equations including terms @xmath62 and @xmath33 only * whereas at the nlo + @xmath63\\otimes q_{ns}^{\\gamma}(q)+\\nonumber \\\\ \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ ! & \\langle e^2 \\rangle \\left\\lbrace   \\left[1+\\frac{\\alpha_s}{2\\pi}c_{q}^{(1)}(1 ) \\right]\\otimes \\sigma^{\\gamma}(q)+\\frac{\\alpha_s}{2 \\pi}c_{g}^{(1)}(1 ) \\otimes g^{\\gamma}(q)\\right\\rbrace + \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi}c_{\\gamma}^{(0)}(x,1 ) \\nonumber \\label{f2_nlo_con}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + where non - singlet , singlet and gluon distribution functions , satisfy now the evolution equations including also the splitting functions @xmath36 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "let us , however , ask the question what happens to the pointlike solution ( [ pl_lo ] ) and ( [ pl_nlo ] ) ( and consequently to @xmath0 ) if we switch off qcd by sending @xmath66 .",
    "for this purpose , it is sufficient consider the non - singlet pointlike distribution function .",
    "it is obvious that provided @xmath67 is kept fixed when @xmath66 the sum ( [ pl_lo_rada ] ) approaches its first term :    @xmath68    corresponding to the first diagram in fig .",
    "[ qpointlike ] and describing purely qed splitting @xmath69 .",
    "this is obvious also from the fact that switching off qcd , keeping @xmath67 fixed , we discard in fig .",
    "[ qpointlike ] all diagrams with qcd verticies and are then left with the first one , purely qed one , giving ( [ q_ns_qed ] ) .",
    "this shows that the claim @xmath70 is misleading .",
    "in fact , this claim can be used only as a shorthand for the specification of large @xmath71 behaviour of @xmath72 .",
    "morover , we see that in the conventional lo approximation to @xmath0 ( [ f2_lo_con ] ) , the effects of qed are partially ignored as the splitting function @xmath62 is included , whereas @xmath58 is not , despite the fact that both come from the first diagram in fig .",
    "[ qpointlike ] .",
    "the alternative approach @xcite is based on the procedure of separating the qed contributions and defining terms `` leading '' and `` next - to - leading '' etc .",
    "uniquely as terms of the qcd origin , starting at @xmath20 .",
    "the crucial role in this approach plays the consideration that @xmath73 is of the order @xmath74 rather then @xmath75 .",
    "consequently @xmath76 can be written as the sum of two terms :    @xmath77    where the purely qed contribution proportional to @xmath12 is given as ( for single quark flavour with unit electric charge )    @xmath78    where @xmath67 is a free parameter , on which the separation of hadron and pointlike parts in ( [ pl&had ] ) depends , and @xmath79 , describing genuine qcd effects satisfies the inhomogeneous evolution equation will be supressed ]    @xmath80 + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s}{2\\pi}\\right)^{2}\\left[\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi}k^{(2)}+p^{(1)}\\otimes q^{\\gamma , pl}_{qed } \\right]+\\cdots \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{\\alpha_s}{2\\pi}p^{(0)}\\otimes q^{\\gamma , pl}_{qcd}+\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s}{2\\pi}\\right)^{2}p^{(1)}\\otimes q^{\\gamma , pl}_{qcd}+\\cdots.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    consequently , the structure function @xmath81 at the lo approximation includes the qed terms :    @xmath82    and the qcd contributions proportional to @xmath83 :    @xmath84    by adding also hadronic part of the distribution functions and summing over charges of all active quarks and antiquarks , this leads ) the full pointlike @xmath76 instead of @xmath85 to full @xmath0 at the lo approximation : @xmath86 the expression ( [ f2_lo_alter ] ) thus differs from the expression in conventional approach ( [ f2_lo_con ] ) by    * the appearance of the corresponding contributions of the photonic coefficient functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 , * the appearance of the convolution of quark coefficient function @xmath57 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , * the fact that @xmath87 resp . @xmath64 and @xmath65 are included in the evolution equations for @xmath47 resp .",
