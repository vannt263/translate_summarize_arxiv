    "the metric in general relativity can be recovered from the causal or conformal structure , that is , the lightcones , up to a scaling factor . by knowing a measure defined on the spacetime",
    ", one can find the volume element , which provides the needed information to completely recover the metric , provided that the spacetime is distinguishing @xcite . recall that a spacetime is _ distinguishing _ if its events can be distinguished by their chronological relations with the other events alone .",
    "for example , if the spacetime contains closed timelike curves , then it is not distinguishing .",
    "if spacetime is distinguishing , then the _ horismos relation _",
    "( for two events @xmath0 , we say `` @xmath1 horismos @xmath2 '' , and we write @xmath3 , if @xmath2 lies on the future lightcone of @xmath1 ) is enough to recover the causal structure @xcite .",
    "we can even start with a reflexive relation which represents the horismos , and by imposing simple conditions , we can recover the relativistic spacetime @xcite .",
    "can we then say that _ causal structure @xmath4 measure = lorentzian spacetime _ ? while it is true that the metric of any distinguishing lorentzian spacetime can be recovered from its causal structure and a measure , not any causal structure and measure lead to a lorentzian metric . in some cases",
    "the determined metric has singularities .",
    "but this is a good thing , since we already know from the singularity theorems of penrose and hawking that , under very general conditions , singularities are unavoidable @xcite .",
    "the problem is that at singularities the metric itself becomes singular , so it seems that it is not the appropriate tool to describe singularities , and something else may be needed .",
    "i will argue in this article that the causal structure may be a better tool , and provide a better insight into singularities , than the metric .",
    "on the other hand , the metric still can be used to describe singularities , at least in some cases . to do this , the standard mathematical framework used in general relativity , which is _ semiriemannian geometry _",
    ", has to be replaced with the more general _ singular semiriemannian geometry _ , which deals with both nondegenerate and degenerate metrics @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to rewrite einstein s equation in a way which remains finite at some singularities where otherwise would have infinities , but which outside the singularities remains equivalent to the original equations @xcite .",
    "it also allowed us to provide finite descriptions of the big - bang singularities @xcite .",
    "we call these singularities , characterized by the fact that the metric becomes degenerate , bur remains smooth , _ benign singularities_. for the black hole singularities , which usually are thought to have singularities where components of the metric tensor @xmath5 tend to infinity ( called _ malign singularities _ ) , it was shown that there are atlases where the metric is degenerate and smooth @xcite .",
    "this approach to singularities turned out to have an unexpected positive side effect : they are accompanied by dimensional reduction effects which were postulated in various approaches to make quantum gravity perturbatively renormalizable @xcite .",
    "all these reasons justify the research in _ singular general relativity _",
    "@xcite , and suggest that if we remove the constraints that the metric has to be _ nondegenerate _",
    "( _ i.e. _ with nonvanishing determinant ) everywhere , singularities turn out not to be a problem . but the metric and other geometric objects like covariant derivative and curvature seem to be different at singularities , despite the fact that the new equations treat on equal footing the singularities and the events outside them",
    ". it would be desirable to have a more homogeneous description of the spacetime , which treats even more uniformly the events at and outside the singularities .",
    "this homogeneous description is provided by the causal structure and the measure giving the volume element .",
    "hence , the fact that the causal structure and the measure can lead to degenerate metrics provides an extra justification of the methods of singular semiriemannian geometry , explaining its success in the case of the benign singularities . in the same time",
    ", this suggests once more that the causal structure is more fundamental than the metric .",
    "as long as the metric is nondegenerate , the intervals determined by the metric between events are in correspondence with the relations determined by the causal structure .",
    "but when we start with a causal structure , the things are different , as we show in this section .",
