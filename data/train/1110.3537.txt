    "<S> while the coupling techniques and protocols proposed here have been presented for alkali atoms , they can be also implemented with rare earth elements . in particular , for ultracold fermionic dy  @xcite , one can benefit from 10@xmath90-enhanced magnetic cooperativity in the rf regime , which , e.g. , reduces practical constraints on atom number , while allowing coherent state transfer to both the telecom regime ( 1322  nm ) and quantum dot transitions ( 953  nm , 1001  nm ) . in summary , we have illustrated that an atomic ensemble coupled to an optical and a microwave waveguide can serve as a long - lifetime memory as well as a photon converter between microwave and optical electromagnetic fields .    </S>",
