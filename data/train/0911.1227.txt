    "unlike classical information , quantum information can not be freely copied . the famous quantum no - cloning theorem @xcite states that it is impossible to perfectly copy non - orthogonal quantum states .",
    "this puts a nontrivial bound on the ability to share quantum information among several parties which can be explored in quantum information processing applications such as quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "although perfect quantum copying is forbidden , one can nevertheless attempt to copy the quantum states in the optimal approximate manner and this has been a subject of numerous theoretical and experimental studies during the recent years @xcite .",
    "optimal quantum cloners have been identified for various sets of input states and some of them have been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .    of particular interest is the optimal universal quantum cloner that should copy equally well all states from the underlying hilbert space @xcite .",
    "the universal quantum cloning can be accomplished by a symmetrization of a state to be cloned and a maximally mixed state of blank copies @xcite .",
    "this insight has led to the experimental realization of the quantum cloning of polarization states of photons via bunching on a balanced beam splitter @xcite .",
    "this procedure provides two clones with identical reduced density matrices and fidelities .",
    "however , one can more generally consider asymmetric quantum cloning machine that produces two clones with different fidelities @xmath1 and @xmath2 such that the trade - off between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is optimal @xcite .",
    "optimal asymmetric phase - covariant cloning has been demonstrated in a nuclear magnetic resonance experiment @xcite and in two optical experiments involving either optical fibers and qubits encoded into path of single photons @xcite or bulk optics and polarization encoding @xcite .",
    "by contrast , so far only a single experimental realization of the universal asymmetric cloner has been reported . in that experiment , asymmetric cloning of polarization states of single photons",
    "was accomplished via partial quantum teleportation @xcite which required detection of four - photon coincidences resulting in low coincidence rate .",
    "the performance of the cloner was thus characterized only for a rather limited set of three different input states .    here",
    "we report on the experimental demonstration of optimal universal asymmetric cloning via the partial symmetrization of a two - photon polarization state .",
    "our linear - optical partial symmetrizer consists in a mach - zehnder interferometer with additional beam splitters in its arms @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry of such cloner can be easily tuned by changing the transmittance of one arm of the interferometer using variable attenuator .",
    "we characterize the performance of the cloner for various degrees of asymmetry by the mean fidelities of the two clones which are experimentally determined as averages of clone fidelities for input states forming three mutually unbiased bases .",
    "an important issue in the experiments where multiphoton coincidences are measured is the proper calibration of the relative detection efficiencies of the single photon detectors .",
    "we show that , interestingly , our method of measurement of the mean clone fidelities is inherently robust with respect to the errors in detection efficiency calibration .",
    "even errors of the order of several ten per - cent can be tolerated as the resulting systematic error in determination of the mean clone fidelities is of the order of @xmath3 or even smaller .",
    "this result implies that reliable estimates of certain parameters such as average fidelities can be obtained even when it is difficult to perfectly calibrate the detectors .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the experimental setup and the measurement procedure .",
    "the experimental results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "iii , where it is shown that our method of determination of the mean fidelities is inherently robust with respect to imperfect detector efficiency calibration .",
    "finally , section iv contains a brief summary and conclusions .",
    "the experimental setup for partial symmetrization of the polarization state of two photons is depicted in fig . 1 and is described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . in brief , correlated photon pairs are produced by the process of type - i degenerate spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) in a nonlinear crystal liio@xmath4 pumped by a cw kr - ion laser with wavelength 413 nm .",
    "the signal and idler photons are spatially filtered by coupling them into single - mode fibers .",
    "the input polarization states of the photons are prepared by means of half- and quarter - wave plates .",
    "the photons then interfere in a mach - zehnder interferometer supplemented by two additional beam - splitters and one neutral density filter ( ndf ) which serves as a polarization - insensitive attenuator .",
    "the output states of the photons are measured by means of two polarization - detection blocks consisting of a sequence of quarter- and half - waveplates , polarizing beam splitter and two single photon detectors .",
    "the device operates in the coincidence basis and the partial symmetrization is successful if a single photon is detected by each block .     and @xmath5 - wave plates , d - describes a set composed of cut - off filter , collimating lens , single - mode fiber and avalanche photodiode , d@xmath6 - auxiliary single photon detector used for stabilization of the interferometer.[setup ] ]    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the modified mach - zehnder interferometer conditionally implements a partial symmetrization operation on the polarization state of the two photons , @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the projector onto the one - dimensional anti - symmetric subspace of the hilbert space of two qubits @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the singlet bell state and @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote horizontal and vertical polarization state of a single photon , respectively .",
    "similarly , @xmath13 denotes projector onto the symmetric subspace of @xmath9 , @xmath14 is the identity operator , and @xmath15 denotes the amplitude transmittance of ndf . in the experiment ,",
    "the interferometer is actively stabilized at zero phase shift between the two arms which guarantees that @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ vs ] ) is real and positive .",
    "the partial symmetrization begins by a two - photon interference on the balanced beam splitter bs@xmath16 .",
    "photons in anti - symmetric singlet bell state @xmath17 anti - bunch and each photon propagates through one arm of the mz interferometer . on the other hand ,",
    "if the photons are in a symmetric polarization state , then they bunch and both must propagate through the upper arm of the interferometer in order to reach the output ports . an attenuator placed in the lower interferometer arm thus selectively attenuates the anti - symmetric part of the two - photon polarization state .    in the implementation of the optimal universal asymmetric @xmath0 cloning operation , the signal photon carries the state @xmath18 that should be copied ,",
    "while the idler photon represents a blank copy and is prepared in a maximally mixed state . in the experiment , this is achieved by randomly preparing the idler photon in one of the six polarization states @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with equal probability @xmath23 .",
    "the input two - photon state can thus be written as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the density matrix of a pure state @xmath18 and @xmath26 stands for the density matrix of a maximally mixed state .",
    "the output state of the partial symmetrizer reads @xmath27 after some algebra we find the following expressions for the normalized reduced density matrices of the two clones a and b , @xmath28/\\mathrm{tr[\\rho_{\\mathrm{out}}]}$ ] , @xmath29/\\mathrm{tr[\\rho_{\\mathrm{out}}]}$ ] , @xmath30 , \\nonumber \\\\ \\rho_b=\\frac{1}{2(3+t^2)}[(5 + 2t+t^2)\\psi+(1-t)^2\\psi_\\perp ] .",
    "\\label{rhoab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fidelities of the two clones , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , can be immediately determined from eq .",
    "( [ rhoab ] ) and we obtain , @xmath33 we can see that the transmittance @xmath15 of the ndf controls the asymmetry of the cloner , i.e. the fidelities of the two clones .",
    "it can be verified that the fidelities ( [ fab ] ) satisfy the optimal trade - off between @xmath1 and @xmath2 achievable by the universal @xmath0 cloning machine @xcite , @xmath34 this confirms that the scheme in fig .",
    "1 implements the optimal asymmetric universal cloning operation .    note that the scheme can be straightforwardly extended such as to produce , in addition to the two optimal clones , also the anti - clone @xcite . instead of a single idler photon in a maximally mixed polarization state",
    "one would have to employ a pair of photons prepared in a maximally entangled polarization singlet bell state .",
    "one photon from this maximally entangled pair whould replace the idler photon and be injected into the partial symmetrizer together with a signal photon whose polarization state should be cloned .",
    "the two partially symmetrized photons would carry the clones while the remaining photon from the maximally entangled pair would represent the anti - clone .",
    "however , such an extended setup would involve three - photon coincidence detection and would require pumping of the nonlinear crystal with femtosecond pulsed laser in order to achieve the necessary temporal synchronization and overlap of photons wavepackets @xcite .",
    "in the experiment , we measure the clone fidelity for six different input states forming three mutually unbiased bases @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . for any basis @xmath38 we first set the waveplates in the detection blocks such that clicks of detectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 represent projection of photon onto polarization state @xmath18 while clicks of @xmath41 and @xmath42 indicate projection onto state @xmath43 .",
    "we measure four two - photon coincidence rates @xmath44 of simultaneous clicks of @xmath45 and @xmath46 ,",
    "where @xmath47 .",
    "for instance , @xmath48 always denotes number of simultaneous clicks of detectors @xmath39 and @xmath42 . for input signal state",
    "@xmath18 the clicks of detector @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) herald successful preparation of clone a ( b ) in state @xmath18 and the fidelities of the two clones can thus be calculated as @xcite @xmath49 we then change the input state of the signal photon to @xmath43 , while leaving the detection blocks unchanged .",
    "we again measure the four coincidence rates @xmath44 .",
    "this time a successful preparation of clone a ( b ) in state @xmath43 is heralded by clicks of detector @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and the fidelities of the two clones are given by @xmath50 note that throughout the paper we shall use lowercase @xmath51 to denote fidelities of clones of single states and uppercase @xmath52 to denote mean fidelities of the cloner .",
    "the mean fidelity of each clone is calculated by averaging the clone fidelities obtained for the three mutually unbiased bases , @xmath53 where the summation runs over @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 .     and @xmath2 .",
    "the symbols represent pairs of fidelities determined from the experimental data before calibration ( red circles ) and after calibration ( blue crosses ) of the relative detection efficiency , see main text .",
    "the solid line indicates the best possible trade - off achievable by the optimal universal asymmetric quantum cloner . ]",
    "the performance of the cloner was experimentally tested for six different degrees of asymmetry @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the resulting mean fidelities of the two clones are plotted in fig .",
    "2 together with the optimal theoretical trade - off curve specified by formula ( [ fab ] ) . we can see that the cloner exhibits good performance and the experimental data follow the theoretical curve .",
    "the measured fidelities lie somewhat below the optimal theoretical bound which can be attributed mainly to the imperfect visibility of the single- and two - photon interference in our setup .",
    "( upper panel ) and second clone @xmath62 ( lower panel ) are plotted for each of the six input states @xmath18 and for the six different degrees of asymmetry ( see text ) which are indicated by different colors and symbols . ]",
    "figure 3 shows the fidelities of the first and second clones for each of the six input states .",
    "since the cloner should be universal , one expects that for a given degree of asymmetry the fidelity should be the same for all inputs .",
    "however , a saw - like oscillatory dependence of @xmath63 and @xmath62 on the input state is clearly visible in fig .",
    "namely , for each basis @xmath64 the fidelity of the clone a of state @xmath18 is lower than the fidelity of the clone a of @xmath43 , while an opposite behavior is found for clone b. taking into account our method of fidelity measurement , this can be explained by an imperfect calibration of the detection efficiencies of the employed apds . in the experiment , we performed auxiliary measurements from which the detection efficiencies were estimated .",
    "the experimental data were then properly re - scaled . however , as fig .",
    "3 reveals this procedure did not completely compensate for the different efficiencies .    since we measure coincidence rates between one detector @xmath45 and one detector @xmath46 , what matters are only the relative efficiencies of the two detectors in each detection block .",
    "we denote by @xmath65 the ratio of detection efficiencies of @xmath41 and @xmath39 , and @xmath66 is defined similarly .",
    "the non - unit relative detection efficiencies can be accounted for by properly rescaling the coincidence rates , @xmath67 we can attempt to calibrate the detectors by determining @xmath65 and @xmath66 that minimize the spread of the fidelity for a fixed asymmetry of the cloner .",
    "we have chosen to minimize the fidelity variance defined as @xmath68 ^ 2 , \\label{fvariance}\\ ] ] where the summation is again performed over the six input states , @xmath69 , @xmath12 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath59 .",
    "numerical minimization of the fidelity variance yields the following values of the relative detection efficiencies , @xmath73 the resulting experimental fidelities obtained from re - calibrated data ( [ crescaled ] ) are plotted in fig .",
    "4 . we can see that for all degrees of asymmetry the calibration significantly reduced the spread of the fidelities , which are now practically constant and independent of the state to be cloned .",
    "this strongly indicates that this calibration yields reliable values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    ) . ]",
    "remarkably , the mean fidelities are almost unaffected by the calibration , as can be seen from fig .",
    "2 . this resilience is a direct consequence of our method of measurement of the clone fidelities .",
    "the imperfect calibration results in underestimation of the fidelity @xmath74 and overestimation of @xmath75 ( and vice versa for clone b ) .",
    "the mean fidelity is proportional to @xmath76 and this averaging significantly reduces the influence of the imperfect calibration on the final result . to show this quantitatively , we explicitly write down the dependence of the clone fidelities on @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "consider ideal optimal asymmetric universal quantum cloner with input state @xmath18 .",
    "the diagonal elements of the density matrix of the two clones in basis @xmath38 can be expressed as follows , @xmath79 where the parameter @xmath80 was introduced to simplify the notation .",
    "note , that the formula ( [ rhopf ] ) does not describe only optimal universal quantum cloner but also more general class of covariant quantum machines characterized by three independent parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath81 .",
    "our analysis given below thus applies to all such machines .",
    "the coincidence rates measured by detectors exhibiting relative detection efficiencies @xmath65 and @xmath66 are given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a constant specifying the overall coincidence rate . on inserting the expressions ( [ rhopf ] ) and ( [ crho ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ fabexppsi ] ) we obtain formula for the fidelity of clone a of state @xmath18 ,    @xmath84    when calculating the measured fidelity for the orthogonal input state @xmath43 we must take into account that due to our measurement method the role of the detectors is reversed with respect to input state @xmath18 .",
    "formally , this means that one can still use eq .",
    "( [ fapsi ] ) but has to replace @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "after some algebra we obtain @xmath93 the terms linear in @xmath94 stemming from @xmath74 and @xmath95 exactly cancel each other so the estimation error depends only quadratically on @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , the coefficients specifying the quadratic error term in eq .",
    "( [ fabarexpansion ] ) are typically very small .",
    "to give a concrete example let us consider optimal symmetric universal quantum cloner .",
    "we then have @xmath96 when we insert these values into eq .",

    "the analysis was presented here for clone @xmath103 but similar formulas and conclusions hold also for the clone b , one only has to properly interchange labels @xmath103 and @xmath104 in the relevant equations .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated optimal universal asymmetric cloning of polarization states of single photons by partial symmetrization .",
    "the linear optical symmetrizer combines single- and two - photon interference in a modified mach - zehnder interferometer and the asymmetry of the cloner can be easily modified by inserting a variable attenuator in one arm of the interferometer .",
    "we have shown that the employed method of measurement of the mean clone fidelities has a built - in resilience against imperfect calibration of the efficiencies of the single photon detectors .",
    "this measurement procedure thus allowed a highly reliable characterization of the cloner and can be potentially useful also for characterization of other devices such as linear optical quantum gates ."
