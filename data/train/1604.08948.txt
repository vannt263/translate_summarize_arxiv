    "ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 , a prominent member of remeika phases , was found to exhibit superconducting transition with @xmath7 k nearly thirty years ago.@xcite it regains recent attention due to the possible coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetic spin - fluctuation as well as the three - dimensional charge density wave ( cdw ) from the supperlattice transition.@xcite the interaction between superconductivity , spin and charge fluctuations has been a central issue in the unconventional superconductivity.@xcite in conventional phonon - mediated superconductors spin - fluctuations usually have negative effect on superconductivity , whereas they could be the source of the electron pairing in the vicinity of the quantum critical point ( qcp ) where spin - fluctuation is enhanced significantly in unconventional superconductors.@xcite it is expected that the spin - fluctuation pairing mechanism results in an unconventional superconducting states .",
    "examples include @xmath8-wave gap in cuprates and heavy fermions superconductor cecoin@xmath9 , and the @xmath10-wave gap in sr@xmath11ruo@xmath1.@xcite    the peak - like anomalies in resistivity and susceptibility of ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 were attributed to the ferromagnetic spin - fluctuation , and the thermodynamic measurements suggested a strongly correlated system .",
    "moreover , the resistivity shows a non - fermi - liquid behavior in the normal state .",
    "fermi liquid emerges by the suppression of the spin - fluctuation with increasing magnetic field.@xcite however , single crystal x - ray diffraction shows that the resistivity anomaly most likely corresponds to a temperature driven structural transition at @xmath3 from a simple cubic phase to the supperlattice with the doubled lattice parameters .",
    "this is related to the fermi surface nesting along the body diagonal direction and the three dimensional charge density wave ( cdw ) instability of the conduction electron system.@xcite    in this paper , we report detailed seebeck coefficient , hall resistivity as well as specific heat measurement on ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 single crystals .",
    "the seebeck coefficient exhibits a peak corresponding to the anomaly in resistivity at @xmath3 , and the carrier density is suppressed significantly below @xmath3 .",
    "this indicates a significant fermi surface reconstruction and the opening of the charge density wave gap at the supperlattice transition .",
    "the magnetic field induced enhancement of the residual specific heat coefficient @xmath4 exhibits nearly linear dependence on magnetic field , indicating a nodeless gap . in the temperature range close to @xmath5 the seebeck coefficient can be described well by the diffusion model .",
    "the zero - temperature extrapolated thermoelectric power is very small , implying large normalized fermi temperature .",
    "consequently the ratio @xmath6 is very small .",
    "our results indicate that ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 is a weakly correlated nodeless superconductor with no significant contribution of spin fluctuations to electronic system in the normal state .",
    "single crystals of ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 were grown using a high - temperature self - flux method.@xcite x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) data were taken with cu k@xmath12 ( @xmath13 nm ) radiation of rigaku miniflex powder diffractometer and the elemental analysis was performed using an energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) in a jeol jsm-6500 scanning electron microscopy .",

    "3(b ) ) .",
    "the resistivity anomaly at @xmath37 k of ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 was considered be from the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation since a negative magnetoresistance is observed which could be attributed to the suppression of the spin fluctuation by magnetic fields .",
    "the resistivity in the normal state shows non - fermi - liquid behavior possibly due to the scattering related to the same spin fluctuation mechanism.@xcite however , the detailed single crystal xrd shows that ( sr / ca)@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 undergoes a temperature driven structural transition at @xmath3 from a simple cubic phase to the supperlattice variant which has a doubled lattice parameter when compared to the high temperature phase .",
    "this transition is possibly related to the cdw instability of the conduction electron system due to the fermi surface nesting along the body diagonal.@xcite    the cdw instability will induce the fermi surface reconstruction and open the cdw gap .",
    "this always induces significant anomaly in seebeck coefficient @xmath29 since it is directly related to the derivative of the density of states at fermi level .",
    "for example , tise@xmath11 at the cdw transition,@xcite , cuprates ( such as yba@xmath11cu@xmath0o@xmath38 ) @xcite and iron - based superconductors ( such as bafe@xmath11as@xmath11 and smfeaso@xmath39)@xcite at the spin density wave transition , exhibit distinct anomaly in seebeck coefficient attributed to the corresponding fermi surface reconstruction .",
    "the anomaly in seebeck coefficient at @xmath3 in ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 reflects the fermi surface reconstruction and the suppression of carrier density below @xmath3 .",
    "alternative explanation for the peak in @xmath29 is the spin entropy due to the spin fluctuation such as the seebeck coefficient in na@xmath40coo@xmath11.@xcite however , our crystal shows diamagnetic behavior in whole temperature range . besides , the magnetic field has no significant influence on the seebeck coefficient in low temperature range ( except for temperature range below @xmath5 where the magnetic fields destroy the superconductivity and enhance the seebeck coefficient as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , and also does not change the peak position in seebeck coefficient .",
    "our measurements reveals a small increase in seebeck coefficient in magnetic field and high temperature range ( around @xmath41 ) .",
    "this is also opposite to the negative magnetothermopower effect observed in na@xmath40coo@xmath11 since the magnetic field will suppress the spin fluctuation.@xcite these results rule out the spin fluctuation in our crystals .",
    "besides these , the suppression of carrier density shown by hall resistivity measurement also implies the opening of the gap at @xmath3 .",
    "base on these discussion , the peak in seebeck coefficient , resistivity and magnetization should originate from the cdw transition at @xmath3 .     of ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 single crystal in 0 t ( squares ) and 9 t ( circles ) respectively .",

    "the specific heat data for the sample below superconducting transition temperature in different magnetic fields are plotted as @xmath43 vs. @xmath44 in fig .",
    "all data could be fitted well by @xmath51 , where @xmath4 is the residual specific heat coefficient in the magnetic field and @xmath52 is the phonon contribution . in the fitting it was necessary to include anharmonic phonon term @xmath53 , possibly due to the very small debye temperature ( fitting of the specific data in 9 t field where superconductivity is completely suppressed gives @xmath54 k , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "4(c)).@xcite magnetic field enhances the residual specific heat coefficient @xmath55 progressively due to the generation of the quasiparticle density of states ( fig .",

    "linear dependence of heat capacity term was also observed in nodeless superconductors such as k@xmath40fe@xmath59se@xmath11,@xcite and points to the nodeless gap in ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 .",
    "another important aspect of superconductivity in ca@xmath0ir@xmath1sn@xmath2 is the proper characterization of the electronic correlation strength in the normal state .",

    "diffusive seebeck response of a fermi liquid is expected to be linear in @xmath61 in the zero - temperature limit , with a magnitude proportional to the strength of electronic correlations .",
    "this is similar to the t - linear electronic specific heat , @xmath62 .",
    "both can be linked to the fermi temperature @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath66 is the electron charge , @xmath67 is the fermi energy and @xmath30 is the carrier density.@xcite fig .",
