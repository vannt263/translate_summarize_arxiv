    "the use of nematic liquid crystals in display devices requires alignment of the liquid crystal on the surfaces that bound the top and bottom of the display cell .",
    "traditionally this alignment is achieved by rubbing the polyimide alignment layers with a velvet cloth . however , this approach leads to contamination and thus there has been considerable effort devoted to achieving alignment via noncontact means , among them the use of linear photopolymerizable polymers @xcite .",
    "one way to achieve director alignment with the polymer is to irradiate it with uv light which polymerizes the material along the local direction of polarization of the light @xcite .",
    "when the nematic material comes in direct contact with the polymer layer subsequent to the uv exposure , the nematic director is planar aligned locally along the direction of the polymer chains .",
    "not only does this alignment process reduce contamination , it also allows for the creation of spatially modulated alignment patterns when the polymeric material is exposed to holographically generated polarization interference patterns . depending on the optics used to generate the interference pattern the modulation can be either one @xcite or two dimensional @xcite in nature .",

    "while the net topological charge of the alignment layer shown in the figure is zero , the pattern introduces frustration and one can ask what the nature of the nematic order in a cell whose alignment surfaces on the top and bottom look like this .",
    "energy considerations require that the point defects on the alignment layers lie on defect lines that penetrate into the nematic .",
    "do these lines thread through the cell joining point defects on opposite sides , or is another geometry possible ?",
    "can this cell exhibit net nematic order given the frustration induced by the boundaries ?",
    "in this paper we answer these questions using monte carlo simulations .",
    "we find that the ratio of the height of the cell ( i.e. , the distance between the patterned alignment layers , often referred to as the `` cell gap '' ) and the lattice spacing @xmath1 between the topological defects plays a crucial role in determining the degree of nematic order and the geometry of the defect lines .    .",
