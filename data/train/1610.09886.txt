    "<S> based on the consideration that the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon of reissner - nordstrm black hole in de sitter space are not independent each other , we conjecture the total entropy of the system should have an extra term contributed from the entanglement between the two horizons , except for the sum of the two horizon entropies . making use of the globally effective first law and the effective thermodynamic quantities , </S>",
    "<S> we derive the total entropy and find that it will diverge as the two horizons tends to coincide .    </S>",
    "<S> gbksong    the astronomical observations show that our universe is probably approaching de sitter one@xcite . however , as is well known that in de sitter space there is no spatial infinity and no asymptotic killing vector which is globally timelike@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , black holes in de sitter space can not be in thermodynamic equilibrium in general . because there are multiple horizons with different temperatures for de sitter black holes . to overcome this problem , one can analyze one horizon and take another one as the boundary or separate the two horizons by a thermally opaque membrane or box@xcite . in this way , the two horizons can be analyzed independently . besides </S>",
    "<S> , one can also take a global view to construct the globally effective temperature and other effective thermodynamic quantities@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> no matter which method is used , the total entropy of de sitter black hole is supposed to be the sum of both horizons , namely @xmath0@xcite .    we think that the truth may be not so simple because the event horizon and the cosmological horizon are not independent . </S>",
    "<S> there may exist some correlations between them due to the following considerations . </S>",
    "<S> we can take the reissner - nordstrm - de sitter ( rnds ) black hole as example . </S>",
    "<S> there are first laws of thermodynamics for both horizons . according to @xcite , the first laws for the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon are respectively : [ 1st ] dm&=&t_bds_b+_b dq+v_bd , + dm&=&-t_cds_c+_c dq+v_cd , where @xmath1 is the conserved mass in ds space , @xmath2 and @xmath3 stand for the electric potential and electric charge , and @xmath4 is the cosmological constant . including the variable @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> the above first laws can have corresponding smarr formulae , which are also given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two laws in eq.([1st ] ) are not truly independent . </S>",
    "<S> they depend on the same quantities @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> all the geometric and thermodynamic quantities for the both horizons can be represented by @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the size of black hole horizon is closely related to the size of the cosmological horizon , and the evolution of black hole horizon will lead to the evolution of the cosmological horizon .    </S>",
    "<S> considering the correlation or entanglement between the event horizon and the cosmological horizon , the total entropy of the rnds black hole is no longer simply @xmath0 , but should include an extra term from the contribution of the correlations of the two horizons .    </S>",
    "<S> the line element of the rnds black holes is given by [ staticmetric ] ds^2=-h(r)dt^2+h(r)^-1dr^2 + r^2d^2 , where [ fr ] h(r ) = 1 - + - . </S>",
    "<S> there are three positive real roots for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the smallest one @xmath7 is the inner / cauchy horizon , the intermediate one @xmath8 is the event horizon of black hole and the largest one is the cosmological horizon .    </S>",
    "<S> generally , the temperatures at the event horizon and cosmological horizon are not equal . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the whole rnds system can not be in equilibrium thermodynamically . however , there are two special cases for the rnds black hole , in which the temperatures at the both horizons are the same . </S>",
    "<S> one case is the so - called nariai black hole , the other is the lukewarm black hole@xcite . for the nariai black hole , </S>",
    "<S> the event horizon and cosmological horizon coincide _ apparently _ and have the same temperature , zero or nonzero@xcite .    considering the connection between the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon , we can derive the effective thermodynamic quantities and corresponding first law of black hole thermodynamics as the pressure and then derive the effective volume . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the effective first law should be : @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> . this has been done in another paper . ] : [ eff1st ] dm = t_effds - p_effdv + _ effdq . </S>",
    "<S> here the thermodynamic volume is that between the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon , namely [ vol ] v = ( r_c^3 - r _ </S>",
    "<S> + ^3 ) = r_c^3 ( 1 - x^3 ) , where @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> the total entropy can be written as [ ent ] s = s _ + + s_c + s_ex= r_c^2 . here </S>",
    "<S> the undefined function @xmath11 represents the extra contribution from the correlations of the two horizons . </S>",
    "<S> then , how to determine the function @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> ?    in general cases , the temperatures of the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon are not the same , thus the globally effective temperature @xmath12 can not be compared with them . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the special case , such as lukewarm case , the temperatures of the two horizons are the same . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that in this special case the effective temperature should also take the same value . on the basis of this consideration , </S>",
    "<S> we can obtain the information of @xmath11 .    according to eq.([eff1st ] ) , the effective temperature can be derived by & = & ( m ) _ q , v + & = & 1 ( m ) _ </S>",
    "<S> r_c ( 1 - x^3 ) + ( m ) _ xx^2 . from eq.([fr ] ) , one know that [ mass ] m=. we can derive the effective temperature t_eff&= & , where a(x)&=&r_c^3 ( x^2+x+1 ) .    in the lukewarm case , there is m^2=q^2=. with this , we can obtain the effective temperature of lukewarm rnds black hole : t_eff=- .    </S>",
    "<S> we also know that for the lukewarm rnds black hole , the temperature is t_+=t_c=. equating the two temperatures , we obtain a differential equation for @xmath11 : f(x)+f(x)=. fortunately , this equation have analytic solution , which is    f(x)= ( 1-x^3)^2/3- , where we have taken the boundary condition @xmath13 .    in fig.[fx </S>",
    "<S> ] , we depict the effective temperature @xmath12 and @xmath14 as functions of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that @xmath12 tends to zero as @xmath16 , namely the charged nariai limit . </S>",
    "<S> although this result does not agree with that of bousso and hawking@xcite , it is consistent with the entropy . as is depicted in fig.[1-b ] </S>",
    "<S> , the entropy will diverge as @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> besides , one can see the entropy is monotonically increasing with the increase of @xmath15 , while @xmath12 first increases and then decreases . according to the general definition of heat capacity , @xmath17 , only in the region of @xmath15 with positive temperature and positive slope the rnds black hole can be thermodynamically stable . </S>",
    "<S> this is unexpectable . </S>",
    "<S> this means when the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon are too far away ( small @xmath15 ) or too close ( large @xmath15 ) , rnds black hole can not be thermodynamically stable .    in this letter , we have presented the entropy of rnds black hole . </S>",
    "<S> it is not only the sum of the entropies of black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon , but also with an extra term from the correlation between the two horizons . </S>",
    "<S> this idea has twofold advantages . </S>",
    "<S> first , if without the extra term in the total entropy , the effective temperature is not the same as that of the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon in the lukewarm case . </S>",
    "<S> this is not satisfactory . </S>",
    "<S> second , the method of effective first law of thermodynamics lacks physical explanation or motivation . while taking advantage of the method , we obtain the corrected entropy of rnds black hole , which may make the method more acceptable . </S>"
