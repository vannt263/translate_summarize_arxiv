    "one of the challenges of supernova research is to obtain evidence about the nature and environment of the progenitor .",
    "type  iin supernovae ( sne  iin ) are so - called because of the presence of narrow lines in the spectra , originating in a relatively undisturbed circumstellar medium ( csm ) ( schlegel 1990 ) .",
    "the progenitors must therefore have undergone one or more mass - loss phases before explosion . by using the interaction of the supernova explosion with the resulting csm",
    "we can obtain clues about the nature of the progenitor .",
    "+ the study of sne iin may also help us to understand the origin of dust in the universe .",
    "more than 30 years ago , it was suggested ( cernuschi , marsicano & kimel 1965 ; cernuschi , marsicano & codina 1967 ; hoyle & wickramasinghe 1970 ) that supernovae could be important sources of interstellar dust .",
    "more recent studies of the origins of grains ( gehrz 1989 ; tielens 1990 ; dwek 1998 ; todini & ferrara 2001 ; nozawa et al .",
    "2003 ) still invoke core - collapse sne as significant contributors of dust to the interstellar medium in the past and present .",
    "dust grains associated with sne can be detected both via their attenuation effects on optical / near - ir radiation , and by their thermal re - radiation at longer ir wavelengths of the absorbed energy .",
    "observation of attenuation provides a relatively unambiguous way of demonstrating grain condensation in the ejecta .",
    "this process is revealed by the relative suppression of the red wings of the broad spectral lines . however , apart from sn  1998s ( leonard et al . 2000 ; gerardy et al . 2000 ; this work ) , only for two events , sn  1987a and sn  1999em , has the condensation of dust in the ejecta been demonstrated via the attenuation of the red wing of the line profiles ( danziger et al .",
    "1991 ; lucy , danziger & gouiffes 1989 ; lucy et al .",
    "1991 ; elmhamdi et al .",
    "+ the second method of demonstrating grain condensation via the appearance of strong ir radiation ( an ` ir excess ' ) as a supernova ages , is more challenging .",
    "at least 10 sne have shown a strong , late - time ( i.e. @xmath11  d ) nir excess ( relative to that expected by extrapolation from the optical region ; see references in gerardy et al .",
    "the natural interpretation is that this radiation is produced by hot dust .",
    "however , while such grains may be the result of condensation processes in the expanding sn ejecta , they may also have formed in pre - explosion circumstellar material ejected during one or more mass - loss episodes experienced by the progenitor star . in this latter case ,",
    "the ir emission is produced as an `` ir echo '' of the maximum - light luminosity from the csm dust .",
    "thus , in the interpretation of such strong nir emission from sne , a key issue is the location of the source . only in the case of sn",
    "1987a has conclusive evidence for dust condensation in the ejecta been presented on the basis of the nir and mid - ir emission ( moseley et al .",

    "recently , dunne et al . (",
    "2003 ) have presented evidence based on sub - mm observations that @xmath12 of cold dust is present in the supernova remnant ( snr ) cassiopeia  a. they argue that the dust must have been produced during the explosion . a similar result for the kepler snr",
    "was presented by morgan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) although in this case an alternative csm origin for the dust was not ruled out , which would be more consistent with the most commonly believed origin for this supernova , i.e. a type ia explosion .",
    "such sub - mm studies may provide important support for the hypothesis that supernovae are a major source of dust .",
    "however , at the moment they have the disadvantages that the supernova types are uncertain , and that the number of examples which can be studied in this way is quite small .",
    "in addition , the results of dunne et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and morgan et al . (",
    "2003 ) have been criticised by dwek ( 2004 ) who points out that , given the mass of condensible elements expected in the ejecta , a very unlikely condensation efficiency of 100% would be required to yield even 2  m@xmath9 of dust .",
    "moreover thermal sputtering would reduce this mass of dust .",
    "dwek offers an alternative scenario where the sub - mm emission is from conductive needles (  metallic whiskers  ) which may be long enough to be very efficient emitters at sub - mm wavelengths thus requiring a dust mass of no more than @xmath13  m@xmath9 to account for the observed radiation .",
    "+ lastly , we note that the unique wavelength and temporal coverage of sn  1987a also made it possible to infer dust condensation from ( a ) spectroscopic evidence for the temporal depletion of gaseous - phase elements in the ejecta e.g. , [ 0i ] ( 6300 ,  6364   ) , [ mgi ] ( 4571  ) , sii ( 1.2  @xmath1 m ) , [ sii ] ( 1.65  @xmath1 m ) and [ caii ] ( 7300   ) ( lucy et al . 1991 ; spyromilio et al . 1991 ; meikle et al .",
    "1993 ) , and ( b ) analysis of the luminosity budget of the ejecta ( e.g. whitelock et al . 1989 ) . as observing facilities",
    "improve , these last two methods of dust detection may eventually be applicable to sne at more typical distances . + to provide conclusive evidence of sne as major dust sources , we need to assemble a statistically significant sample of typed supernovae in which grain formation can be reliably tested .",
    "in addition , by studying the evolution of recent supernovae in real time we can obtain information about the physics of the dust - formation process . in order to disentangle the two possible origins of the nir radiation , it is vital to acquire ir observations spanning as wide a wavelength and temporal range as possible .",
    "the longer nir wavelengths ( @xmath14 bands ) are especially important since the flux at these wavelengths is less likely to be contaminated by scattered light or strong h , he emission lines , allowing a simple thermal interpretation .",
    "+    an opportunity to address both the progenitor problem and the question of supernovae as dust sources was provided by the occurrence of the sn iin 1998s .",

    "a rough blackbody fit yields t@xmath525,000  k , but with a blue excess ( leonard et al .",
    "2000 ; fassia et al .",
    "the emission lines are identified with hi ( balmer series ) , hei , heii , ciii and niii .",
    "the high - ionisation carbon and nitrogen lines are also commonly observed in wolf - rayet stars ( leonard et al .",
    "the emission lines have a broad base ( e.g. , h@xmath2 fwzi@xmath520,000 km s@xmath18 ) , but a narrow ` peaked ' unresolved centre .",
    "the lines are symmetrical about the local standard of rest .",
    "this is quite surprising since at such an early phase most of the receding part of the supernova should be occulted by the photosphere .",
    "however , this may actually constitute some of the earliest evidence of a strong ejecta - csm wind interaction .",
    "it has been shown theoretically that , at this phase , one might expect the photosphere to reside in a geometrically thin , opaque cool dense shell ( cds ) formed by the radiative shock propagating into the extended stellar envelope ( grasberg , imshennik & nadyozhin 1971 ; falk & arnett 1977 ; chevalier & fransson 1985 ; 1994 ) .",
    "chugai ( 2001 ) has argued that these lines originate from the cds and that the line broadening is caused by the multiple thomson scattering of line photons on thermal electrons of the circumstellar gas .",
    "the weakness of broad ejecta lines during this early era is attributed to the sharp photosphere at the sn ejecta boundary .",
    "the blue excess can also be attributed to the cds , since the significant optical depth can yield an increase in continuum absorptive opacity with wavelength , due to both bound - free , ( i.e. , the paschen continuum ) and free - free processes ( leonard et al . 2000 ) .",
    "+ by about 3  weeks after the explosion , the emission lines had almost totally vanished .",
    "this disappearance is attributed to the dense inner - csm being overrun by the ejecta .",
    "this persisted for @xmath537 weeks . during this time weak narrow lines are present , superimposed on the continuum .",
    "these are caused by the photoionization and heating of the undisturbed wind by the supernova flash and subsequent x - ray emission from the shocked wind and ejecta .",
    "high - resolution echelle spectra of these lines were obtained by bowen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and fassia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) on days  23 and 42 .",
    "these observations succeeded in resolving the lines . between day  23 and day  42 the red wing of the [ oiii ]  5007    profile moved redward , broadening the line , so that by the latter epoch the profile was symmetrical about a velocity of + 847  km s@xmath18 .",
    "a high - resolution observation of gruendl et al .",
    "( 2002 ) at 1 year showed that the [ oiii ]  5007    profile was still symmetrical about this redshift .",
    "this behaviour can be explained as being due to the effect of the finite light travel time across a csm having a denser outer zone .",
    "as the radiation - induced ionisation ( due to the flash + shock radiation ) propagates across the csm , it takes longer for the resulting nebular emission to reach us from the far side . at",
    "any given time , therefore , the observer sees radiation from an ellipsoidal surface propagating through the csm ( morrison & sartori 1969 ) . on day  23 , the vertex region of the ellipsoid had not yet reached the inner boundary of the denser zone , thus accounting for the weakness of the red wing of the line .",
    "however , the lack of any further shift in the line centre between 46  days and 1  year indicates that the vertex had already reached the dense zone by 46  days .",
    "the early evolution of the line asymmetry can be quantitatively explained if the inner boundary of the denser zone was at a distance of 16.5 light days ( 2850  au ) .",
    "we note that this distance is consistent with the observed persistence of the line for at least a year since , assuming a maximum ejecta velocity of 10,000 km s@xmath18 ( leonard et al .",
    "2000 ; fassia et al . 2001 ) , at 1  year it would still only have reached 2050  au and so would not yet have disturbed the dense outer csm region ( but see subsection 4.2 below ) .",
    "fassia et al . (",
    "2001 ) adopted + 847  km s@xmath18 as the centre of mass velocity for the sn  1998s system .",
    "justification for this is provided by the light travel time argument together with the lack of any further shift between day  46 and 1  year . from the narrow forbidden lines such as [ oiii ]  5007   ,",
    "an undisturbed csm velocity of about 40  km s@xmath18 is obtained , which is characteristic of a red supergiant ( rsg ) wind . from the intensity ratio of [ oiii ] ( 4959    + 5007   ) to [ oiii ] 4363   , fassia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) infer a csm density of at least @xmath19  cm@xmath8 at 185  au , implying a csm mass exceeding 0.005  m@xmath9 , and a mass - loss rate exceeding around @xmath21  m@xmath9 yr@xmath18 .",
    "this is consistent with the radio / x - ray estimate ( scaled to a 40  km  s@xmath18 wind velocity ) of @xmath22  m@xmath9 yr@xmath18 ( pooley et al . 2002 ) , and is comparable to that of sn 1979c which had a mass loss rate of @xmath23  m@xmath9 yr@xmath18 ( lundqvist & fransson 1988 ) . + the behaviour of the narrow allowed h  i , he  i csm lines was more complex .",
    "not only did they exhibit asymmetric p  cygni profiles , but there were clearly two velocity components .",
    "the slower component is attributed to the same origin as the forbidden lines _ viz . _",
    "the photo - ionised , unaccelerated csm .",
    "the profile of this component was probably a combination of emission from recombination and possibly collisional excitation , together with a classical p  cygni line due to scattering from the populated excited levels .",
    "the broad absorption component is more difficult to explain .",
    "it extends to a velocity of around 350  km s@xmath18 which is too fast for a rsg wind .",
    "it may be that , as in the case of sn  1987a , the sn  1998s progenitor went through a fast - wind phase prior to explosion ( fassia et al .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the csm close to the supernova was accelerated by photospheric photons , or by relativistic particles from the ejecta / csm shock ( chugai et al .",
    "another possibility is that the faster component arose in shocked clumps within the csm wind ( chugai et al .",

    "broad emission lines in p@xmath24 and he  i 1.083  @xmath1 m had appeared .",
    "the earliest second season optical spectra ( day  78 ) showed a similar development in h@xmath25 and the caii triplet ( fassia et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the line profiles became increasingly `` square - shaped '' , characteristic of strong interaction between the expanding ejecta and a dense csm ( leonard et al . 2000 ; fassia et al . 2000 ) .",

    "+ in summary , the wind of the sn  1998s progenitor underwent discrete changes in the rate of mass outflow , resulting in several distinct csm zones .",
    "the fading of the early - time broad emission components by about day  18 indicates that the radius of the first boundary was less than 100  au ( leonard et al .",

    "for the explosion epoch adopted here , the reappearance occurred between days  42 and 50 corresponding to @xmath26  au .",
    "however , the reality of this second boundary was contested by chugai et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who suggested the reappearance was due simply to the cds becoming optically thin .",
    "finally , as argued above , the evolution of the narrow - line profile suggests a third boundary at about 2850  au where the csm again underwent a density increase . for a wind velocity of 40  km s@xmath18",

    "we find that the quality of fits was generally no better than for blackbodies and so on this basis alone we do not rule out optically - thin emission with a @xmath66 dependence .",

    "similar trends with time are obtained , but with much larger velocities being required to account for the observed luminosity .",
    "the uncertainty in the extinction is quite large ( a@xmath67 , fassia et al . 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , to check the effect on the above results , we repeated the fitting procedure using the range of a@xmath68 values encompassed by the errors .",
    "we conclude that the extinction uncertainty introduces an additional error of only 1% or 2% in the derived parameters .    as indicated in section  1.1 , there is some uncertainty about the distance to ngc  3877 at the level of about @xmath691  mpc .",
    "consequently this introduces an additional uncertainty of about @xmath6912% .",
    "while this does not affect the shape of the bolometric luminosity light curve , it does act on its overall level .",
    "what powered the post-300  d ir emission from the dust , and where was the dust located ?",
    "integrating over the single temperature blackbody fits , the total energy emitted by the dust region between days 300 and 1200 was about @xmath70  ergs , or @xmath71  ergs in the 1.5 - 4.8  @xmath1 m range . even for the more conservative value ,",
    "this is a factor of @xmath72 more than could be supplied by the decay of the daughter products of 0.15  m@xmath9 @xmath41ni ( fassia et al .",
    "2001 ) over the same period .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "13 , where we compare the radioactive luminosity with the contemporary ir luminosity derived from the blackbody fits .",
    "+ we can therefore immediately rule out radioactivity as the main source of the post-300  d ir energy .",
    "however , a much larger energy source is available .",
    "it is likely that of order 10@xmath73  ergs was stored in the kinetic energy of the ejecta , so it would take only @xmath51% of this to account for the ir emission through the radiative heating of pre - existing ( csm ) and/or newly - condensed ( ejecta ) dust .",
    "for example , for a progenitor with an extended structure or very dense wind , the ejecta / csm interaction could rather easily convert @xmath510% of the kinetic energy to radiation ( falk & arnett 1977 ; chugai et al . in preparation ) , thus providing the energy of the early light curve ( 040  days ) which we know amounted to @xmath510@xmath74  ergs ( fassia et al .",
    "if , then , a fraction ( say 510% ) of this early light curve emission were absorbed by csm dust and re - emitted as an ir echo , it would account for the observed ir radiation .",
    "gerardy et al.(2000 ) suggested that dust could be heated as a result of energy released in the ejecta / csm interaction , either by direct shock - heating or by absorption of x - rays from the interaction region .",
    "however , they were not able to address the origin of the dust , i.e. newly - formed in the sn ejecta or pre - existing in the csm .",
    "as argued earlier , the large , low - temperature @xmath4-band flux seen at 136  days must have been due to emission from pre - existing dust , i.e. , an ir echo .",
    "however , such an argument is less convincing at the later times being considered here .",
    "the blackbody fits produce velocities not exceeding 4200  km s@xmath18 , and generally slower than this ( table  8) .",
    "grain condensation in ejecta located at such velocities is conceivable .",
    "however , while the evolution of the line profiles provides convincing evidence that dust did condense in the ejecta , this does not automatically mean that this dust was also the source of the ir emission .",
    "ir radiation from a dusty csm must therefore also be examined .      to try to distinguish between the ir echo and dust condensation scenarios ,",
    "we consider first the possibility that the ir emission arose from pre - existing dust in the csm .",
    "it is unlikely that csm dust was directly heated by the supernova shock energy .",
    "the supernova radiation around maximum would have evaporated the dust to a radius @xmath75 .",
    "the size of the dust - free cavity in such an explosion has been estimated by a number of authors to lie in the range 4,00080,000  au ( wright 1980 ; bode & evans 1980 ; dwek , 1983 , 1985 ; graham & meikle 1986 ; gerardy et al . 2002 ) .",
    "dwek ( 1983 , 1985 ) finds that for a supernova with a peak uv - optical bolometric luminosity of @xmath76 and an exponential decline rate timescale of 25 days , @xmath75 is @xmath54,000  au for carbon - rich grains ( t@xmath77 ) and 20,000  au for oxygen - rich grains ( t@xmath78 ) .",
    "this is for 0.1  @xmath1 m radius particles in an @xmath79 density distribution .",
    "the early bolometric light curve of sn  1998s derived from blackbody fits to the optical - ir photometry ( fassia et al . 2000 ) can be described as @xmath80 erg s@xmath18 .",
    "the more conservative spline - fit integration values yield @xmath81 erg s@xmath18 .",
    "thus , given that @xmath82 ( dwek 1985 ) we conclude that the evaporation radius for sn  1998s would have been at least 5,000 - 9,000  au for graphite grains , and at least 24,000 - 40,000  au for silicate grains . the fastest moving ejecta material ( @xmath510,000  km s@xmath18 , fassia et al",
    "2001 ) would have reached only 7,000  au by the latest epoch ( 1242  d ) , almost certainly placing it well within the dust - free cavity throughout the observations presented here .",
    "the ejecta would , therefore , have been unable to interact directly with csm dust .",
    "+ it is likely that an x - ray precursor is produced as the forward shock moves through the dust - free low - density gas in the cavity .",
    "these x - rays would eventually reach the dust and hence may provide the energy needed for the ir emission .",
    "a concern might be that the x - rays could be severely attenuated by the gas in the cavity ( assuming the unshocked gas in the cavity was not already fully ionized by the initial x - rays ) . assuming a steady mass loss rate of @xmath22  m@xmath9 yr@xmath18 ( see section 1.1 ) we find that the gas column density between the shock front and the edge of the dust free cavity ( assumed to be @xmath525,000  au ) is @xmath83cm@xmath18 at 333  d. this corresponds to an optical depth @xmath85 for x - rays of e@xmath86  kev .",
    "given the hard x - ray spectrum observed ( @xmath87  kev , pooley et al .",
    "2002 ) we do not expect strong absorption of x - rays within the cavity .",
    "we note that x - rays would also be produced by the reverse shock .",
    "however , if it is radiative early on this might produce a cds ( chevalier & fransson 1985 ) , causing additional attenuation of this x - ray component .",
    "the difficulty with the x - ray precursor scenario is that the observed x - ray luminosity is much less than that of the contemporary ir luminosity . at 674  days , measurements with chandra",
    "indicate that @xmath88  erg s@xmath18 ( pooley et al . 2002 ) , and as indicated above , we expect that these hard x - rays would only be weakly absorbed within the cavity . however , this luminosity is about @xmath89 lower than the blackbody - derived ir luminosity observed at this time .",
    "light travel time effects mean that , in general , the observed ir emission would have been produced by the x - ray precursor at an earlier , possibly brighter phase .",
    "for example , by 664  d , a shock travelling at @xmath510,000  km s@xmath18 would have reached about 3800  au .",
    "the largest delay would be for x - rays emitted directly away from us .",
    "this would amount to a delay of about 60  d for a 5,000  au radius dust - free cavity to about 460  d for a 40,000  au cavity .",
    "however , even a year later the ir luminosity has declined by only a factor of 3 , i.e. , it is still @xmath395 more luminous than the x - ray flux one year before .",
    "a perhaps rather desperate solution might be to suggest that more than @xmath590% of the x - rays are being transformed into ir radiation , i.e. , most of the x - rays are absorbed by the dust , yet leaving enough to be detected by chandra .",
    "( we note the actual percentage could be somewhat less if the true x - ray temperature is higher than the @xmath510  kev derived from the chandra observations so that the x - ray flux was significant above chandra s energy limit . ) in such a scenario , we would expect the x - ray and ir light curves to be reasonably correlated . between days 674 and 1044 the x - ray flux declined by about @xmath392 while the ir luminosity fell by @xmath393 in the same period .",
    "given the complications of light travel times across the csm , this might be consistent with an x - ray precursor - driven ir luminosity .",
    "however , a particular difficulty with the x - ray precursor model is that in general , for solid material , x - rays are more penetrating than uv / optical radiation ( wilms , allen & mccray 2000 ) . as indicated above , to account for the low x - ray / ir luminosity ratio",
    "we need the dust optical depth to the x - rays to be at least 2.5 , in which case the optical depth to uv - optical photons would be even higher . yet , for the ir - echo mechanism to produce the observed ir luminosity we require an optical depth to uv - optical - photons of about 0.2 ( see below ) .",
    "in other words , in the case of the x - ray precursor mechanism , if we invoke sufficient dust absorption to account for the low x - ray / ir luminosity ratio then the ir - echo mechanism predicts an ir luminosity which exceeds the observed value by a large factor .",
    "even if we adopt the lower @xmath90 @xmath1 m luminosity values , a similar conclusion is reached .",
    "gerardy et al . ( 2000 ) left open the possibility that the ir flux might arise from either direct shock heating or x - ray - precursor heating of pre - existing csm dust .",
    "however , from the above discussion we believe that both possibilities are ruled out .",
    "direct shock heating is impossible as the ejecta would not yet have reached the edge of the dust - free cavity .",
    "x - ray precursor heating is probably ruled out since it implies an ir - echo of much greater intensity than the observations could support .",
    "+ we now consider thermal emission following the heating of csm dust by supernova radiation emitted around the time of maximum light , i.e. , an `` ir echo '' .",
    "owing to the light travel time across the csm , the ir emission seen at earth at a given time originates from a zone bounded by ellipsoidal surfaces , with the axis coincident with the line - of - sight .",
    "the thickness of this zone is fixed by the characteristic width of the uv - optical light curve around maximum . while the uv - optical ellipsoid is still partially within the dust - free cavity , we expect the ir light curve to be relatively flat ( dwek 1983 ; gerardy et al .",
    "however , once the whole ellipsoid has left the cavity , the ir flux declines . even at our earliest epoch of 333  d , we see no sign of a plateau in the observed ir light curves , indicating that sn  1998s was already beyond the echo plateau phase . at 333  days",
    "the vertex of the ellipsoid would be 30,000  au from the supernova .",
    "this indicates that , if the ir - echo scenario is valid , the cavity radius must have been less than 30,000  au . + the flux , spectral energy distribution and evolution of a supernova / csm ir - echo has been examined by a number of authors ( wright 1980 ; bode & evans 1980 ; dwek , 1983 , 1985 ; graham & meikle 1986 ; gerardy et al .",
    "2002 ) . of particular interest here is the study of sn  1979c by dwek ( 1983 ) .",
    "this supernova seems to have been similar to sn 1998s ( cf .",
    "liu et al . 2000 ) .",
    "both supernovae were unusually luminous at early times and both exhibited a strong ir excess at late times .",
    "dwek ( 1983 ) argues that the late - time ir emission of sn  1979c was due to an ir - echo produced in a massive circumstellar wind . in addition , the early - time bolometric light curve adopted by dwek ( 1983 ) for sn  1979c is exponential with a 23  day timescale - very similar to the spline - fit light curve for sn  1998s ( see above and fassia et al .",
    "the extinction towards sn  1979c was somewhat less than for sn  1998s , while their distances were almost identical .",
    "after correcting for the difference in extinction ( @xmath91 ) , we find that the early - time bolometric light curve of sn  1998s ( spline - fit ) is @xmath92 more luminous , while its post-300  d blackbody - derived ir luminosity is @xmath93 less luminous than the corresponding values for sn  1979c .",
    "scaling dwek s results to sn  1998s indicates that about 20% of its early - time uv - optical output must have been absorbed by csm dust .",
    "applying dwek s @xmath6 emissivity model to a wind velocity of 40  km s@xmath18 ( fassia et al .",
    "2001 ) , this yields a mass - loss rate of @xmath94 yr@xmath18 , comparable to the values indicated by optical , x - ray and radio studies ( anupama et al . 2001 ; fassia et al . 2001",

    "similarly , for the total ir luminosity decline rate , while dwek predicts an e - folding time of 340  days between years  1 and 2 , our observations indicate e - folding times of about 470  days ( @xmath96 m luminosity ) or 700  days ( blackbody luminosity ) . however , these discrepancies may be indicative of a flatter csm density law than @xmath79 , i.e. that the csm wind was stronger in the past .",
    "in addition , these models assumed a spherically symmetric wind , whereas the sn  1998s csm probably had a more flattened geometry ( leonard et al .",
    "2000 ; gerardy et al .",
    "+ in addition to the modest decline rate disagreement , we also note that dwek s model provides an imperfect match to the sn  1979c @xmath97 sed .",
    "similar discrepancies with the dwek model are seen for the sn  1998s seds .",
    "dwek argues that this may be due to the contamination of the @xmath45 ( and @xmath30 ) band fluxes with residual photospheric emission .",
    "however , our post-300  d ir spectra of sn  1998s do not support this explanation ( cf .",
    "11 , day  333 ) .",
    "we recall that the dwek models utilise dust emissivity laws of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , whereas our analysis indicates that single temperature blackbodies yield a superior fit to the @xmath65 seds of sn  1998s .",
    "this suggests that the dust grains are in an opaque clumped distribution , or are of larger individual size than in the dwek model .",
    "of course , the sed of the ir - echo model is made up of fluxes from material having a range of temperatures .",
    "it is therefore not clear that even with ` black - body ' grains ( or clumps ) we would be able to reproduce the single temperature behaviour .",
    "+ we conclude that the ir - echo scenario is not ruled out as providing the mechanism responsible for the post-300  d ir flux from sn  1998s .",
    "however , to make it work it has to be pushed to quite an extreme case where 20% of the early - time light is absorbed by the dust .",
    "there is little sign of such absorption in the form of reddening although , as already indicated , the dust grains could be clumped or are individually too large to give a reddening effect in the wavelength range studied .",
    "in addition , the simple spherically - symmetric ir - echo models do not fully agree with the observed decline rates and seds .",
    "further progress will probably require more detailed ir - echo modelling , including asymmetric and episodic cases .",
    "+      we now consider newly - condensed dust as the origin of the ir luminosity .",
    "gerardy et al . ( 2000 ) suggested that the detailed shape and evolution of the h@xmath2 and hei profiles could be due to the ejecta impacting on a disk - shaped csm , together with the condensation of dust within the ejecta .",
    "we agree that this is a promising scenario . as both gerardy et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and leonard et al .",
    "( 2000 ) point out , the relatively sudden fading of the central and red - shifted components of the hi , hei line profiles immediately suggests dust condensation in the ejecta , causing obscuration of the central and receding regions .",
    "a similar effect was observed in the ejecta line profiles of sn  1987a ( lucy et al .",
    "1989 ; spyromilio , meikle & allen 1990 ; danziger et al . 1991 ) and , more recently , in the type iip sn  1999em ( elmhamdi et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the presence of co emission from sn  1998s as early as 115  days ( fassia et al . 2001 ) lends credence to the dust condensation scenario .",
    "moreover , in spite of the much lower s / n of the hei  1.083  @xmath1 m profile , plus its contamination by p@xmath32 up to about the end of year  1 , we judge that the obscuration effect is comparably strong at 0.66  @xmath1 m and 1.08  @xmath1 m , at least up to about day  400 .",
    "this suggests that the dust became quickly optically thick either due to forming in clumps , or ( less likely ) growing rapidly to a large grain size .",
    "after day  400 , the very low s / n of the hei red wing makes comparison impractical .",
    "+    could newly - condensed dust also have been responsible for the post-300  d ir luminosity of sn  1998s ?",
    "as already indicated , there is an ample reservoir of energy available from the supernova kinetic energy which could radiatively heat the dust . for the pure blackbody",
    "fits , we note that in the period @xmath5330400  days the velocity of the dust blackbody was @xmath590% of the velocity of the blue - shifted hi , hei peaks ( see fig .",
    "consequently , for optically - thin dust characterised by @xmath6 , @xmath7 or @xmath66 emissivities to account for the observed ir luminosity at this epoch , it would need to have condensed at velocities higher than those indicated by the blue peaks of the h and he lines , i.e. well beyond the main ejecta / csm shock interaction .",
    "this seems unlikely .",
    "moreover , as pointed out already , @xmath6 and @xmath7 emissivities yield poorer fits than does a pure blackbody .",
    "we therefore discount ir luminosity characterised by optically thin emissivities , and confine our attention to pure blackbody emission . after 333",
    "d the dust and blue peak velocities decline roughly at the same rate until about 400  days after which the hi , hei peak velocity levelled off while that of the dust continued to decline .",
    "the near coincidence of the velocities for the @xmath5100  days after 333  d suggests a possible physical link between the origins of the hi , hei peaks and the ir luminosity .",
    "it has been recognised for many years ( e.g. , chevalier & fransson 1985 ) that the interaction of the supernova ejecta with a dense csm will produce outer and reverse shocks . when radiative cooling is important at the reverse shock front , the gas undergoes a thermal instability , cooling to @xmath510,000  k , thus forming a dense , relatively cool zone - the cds .",
    "line emission from low - ionisation species in the cds will be produced ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) .",
    "we suggest that this emission could have been responsible for the blue and red peaks of the h@xmath2 and hei line profiles .",
    "this leads to the interesting possibility that dust may have formed in the cds at the ejecta / wind interface .",
    "( note that this could be _ as well as _",
    "dust formation in the metal - rich sn ejecta interior . )",
    "if cooling in the outer layer of the cds , shielded from the reverse shock x - ray / uv radiation , brought the temperature to below the condensation temperature , dust could have formed and survived there .",
    "the physics here is reminiscent of the radiative shock of colliding winds of wolf - rayet stars , which is known to be a dust - forming site ( usov 1991 ) .",
    "however , unlike the wolf - rayet material , the cds has a normal composition with the carbon - to - oxygen ratio being less than unity .",
    "consequently , at first sight , carbon dust might not be expected to form since all the carbon in the cds would be bound into co. however he@xmath98 ions produced by x - ray absorption efficiently destroy co via the reaction he@xmath99co",
    "@xmath100 he+c@xmath99o ( lepp , dalgarno & mccray 1990 ) , yielding the relatively low observed mass of co ( see introduction ) .",
    "we estimate that dust formed in the cds after day  200 may survive in the radiation field of sn 1998s .",
    "the occurrence of rayleigh - taylor or convective instabilities ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) can lead to the formation of opaque clumps of dust within the cds , producing significant occultation of the central and receding parts of the supernova and radiative heating of the grains , while at the same time allowing some of the line radiation to escape from the approaching component of the cds .",
    "( given that the cds has a temperature of @xmath510,000  k , collisonal heating of the grains would be negligible , e.g. dwek & werner 1981 ) . thus , this scenario might simultaneously account for the strong ir flux , the obscuration effect and the blackbody velocity coincidence with that of the line profiles .",
    "+ how much dust would be needed to achieve the required obscuration ?",
    "consider dust grains of radius @xmath101 in spherical clumps of radius @xmath102 .",
    "for a spherical cds whose thickness is small relative to its radius , the total mass of dust in clumps , @xmath103 , required to yield a cds optical depth @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the radius of the cds , @xmath107 is the grain number density and @xmath108 is the density of the dust grain material .",

    "note that this is a lower limit i.e. larger values of @xmath109 yield higher masses . repeating this calculation for subsequent epochs , we find that the dust mass ( lower limit ) remains roughly constant up to about 700  d , after which it declines .",
    "@xmath104 declines monotonically throughout this time , reaching 0.15 at 1000  d. + at 346  d the intensity ratio of the red and blue h@xmath2 peaks is 0.25 .",
    "if we assume that the two peaks have the same intrinsic luminosity at all times , then we can interpret the red deficit as being due to an optical depth across the supernova of about 1.4 .",
    "this is similar to the optical depth of 2 derived in the previous paragraph at the same epoch , using the velocities of the h@xmath2 peak and the ir blackbody .",
    "this lends support to the suggestion that condensing dust is responsible for both the line profile attenuation _ and _ the ir luminosity .",
    "a difficulty is that while the optical depths derived from the covering factor decrease with time , those derived from the h@xmath2 red / blue intensity ratio increase with time . a possible explanation might be that initially the optical depth was dominated by hot , newly - formed dust and it was purely this dust which was responsible for the obscuration _ and _ the observed near - ir flux",
    "this would explain the similarity at 346  d of the optical depths derived in the two ways .",
    "however , if dust condensation was continuous throughout the 3461093  d period it is possible that , if the dust which formed at earlier epochs cooled , our nir observations would have detected a decreasing fraction of the total dust .",
    "such a process would also mean that dust was present at an increasing range of temperatures , and this may account for the poorer blackbody fits at the later epochs . in summary , we agree about the plausibility of the dust - condensation scenario which gerardy et al .",
    "( 2000 ) put forward as one of a number of possibilities .",
    "we have refined this proposal in that we suggest that the dust is formed in the cds , with the energy source for the ir emission coming ultimately from the shock interaction",
    ". however we note that if , as discussed in section 4.1.1 , the ir emission was predominantly due to an ir echo then the optical depth ` discrepancy ' would disappear i.e. we would not then expect to see a correlation between the optical depths derived via the covering factor argument ( which would be inappropriate for an ir echo ) and those derived from the h@xmath2 red / blue intensity ratio .",
    "the h@xmath2 and hei 1.083  @xmath1 m lines persisted beyond 3  years post - explosion ( figs . 8 & 9 ) . at 1093  days the extreme blue wing of h@xmath2 was at a velocity of @xmath55800  km s@xmath18 , corresponding to 3650  au , confirming that the csm must have extended to at least this distance ( for a csm velocity of 40 km s@xmath18",
    ", this implies that the progenitor mass loss started at least 430 years prior to explosion ) .",
    "however , as explained above , even at this late epoch it is unlikely that the ejecta would have encountered any pre - existing csm dust .",
    "the most notable change in the h@xmath2 profile is the appearance of an emission feature peaking at about the velocity of the supernova rest frame .",

    "we note that the red side of the h@xmath2 feature is still very weak , presumably due to attenuation by dust which condensed in the sn .",

    "( 2000 ) as an explanation for the earlier ( and much stronger ) central peak of the h@xmath2 feature .",

    "we suggest that the ir excess in these cases may also have been a mixture of emission from cds dust and csm dust . by @xmath5500  d we know that dust condensing and cooling in the ejecta of sn  1987a was almost certainly responsible for the reddening of the @xmath10 colour ( e.g. wooden 1989 ; bouchet & danziger 1993 ; meikle et al .",
    "1993 ; roche et al . 1993 ; wooden et al .",
    "1993 ) . from the discussion above we also favour dust condensation in sn  1998s as the explanation for its ir luminosity after @xmath51  year .",
    "given the similarity of sn  1979c to 1998s , we suggest that its day  440 @xmath10 point also indicates that most of its ir emission was from cds dust at this time .",
    "we note that at this phase the blackbody velocity of sn  1979c would be only about 3000  km s@xmath18 .",
    "+ we therefore propose that the appearance of a strong @xmath10 excess during the first year is indicative of a massive csm .",
    "the ir flux can be a mixture of emission from cds dust and an ir - echo .",
    "determination of the relative contributions requires good late - time ir and optical coverage , as this paper has shown . for the progenitors of sne which do not show an ir - excess in the 100350  day period ( e.g. , sne  1987a , 2002hh )",
    ", it is much less likely that they were surrounded by a massive csm in their immediate vicinity .",
    "if such sne subsequently produce an ir excess this is probably due to dust condensation throughout the ejecta as was inferred for sn  1987a .",
    "we have presented post-300  d infrared and optical observations of the sn iin 1998s which extend to longer wavelengths and later epochs than has ever been achieved for this type of supernova .",
    "sn  1998s is only the second ever supernova for which @xmath0-band has been detected .",
    "the ir photometry presented here , together with an earlier measurement by fassia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , has revealed a strong ir - excess during the period 136 to 1242  days .",
    "spectroscopy in the @xmath3 bands show a continuum rising towards longer wavelengths .",
    "broad h@xmath2 and hei 1.083  @xmath1 m line profiles present at @xmath54  months had undergone a dramatic change when they were recovered by gerardy et al .",
    "( 2000 ) at about 8  months . by this time",
    ", both lines took the form of a triple peak structure with a central peak close to the supernova rest frame velocity , and with the two other peaks lying at 4860  km s@xmath18 and + 3400  km s@xmath18 respectively .",
    "gerardy et al . argue that this could be indicative of emission from a disk - like or ring - like csm .",
    "our observations show that as the supernova evolved , the redward half of the profiles became increasingly weak relative to the blue part so that by the end of the second year the red side had almost completely vanished .",
    "we agree with gerardy et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and leonard et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that this is strongly indicative of dust condensation within the ejecta of the supernova .",
    "the change in the appearance of the h@xmath2 profile by 1093  d together with the early - time evolution of the narrow csm [ oiii ]  5007    line may indicate a density discontinuity at about 2850  au implying that the progenitor mass - loss rate underwent a decline about 340  years ago .",
    "the velocity of the extreme blue wing of the h@xmath2 line at 1093  days implies that the csm extended to at least 3650  au indicating that mass loss had been taking place for at least 430  years prior to explosion . +",
    "the intensity and rise of the @xmath3 continuum towards longer wavelengths together with the relatively bright @xmath4 and @xmath0 magnitudes suggests strongly that the ir emission was due to hot dust condensing in the ejecta and/or pre - existing in the csm .",
    "we find that the sed represented by the @xmath65 magnitudes and by the @xmath3 continua ( when available ) can be well - reproduced with single - temperature blackbody functions having temperatures of about 1250  k at 333  days declining to about 1100  k at 464  days .",
    "subsequent epochs yield temperatures declining to about 900  k at 3  years , although the fits are somewhat poorer .",
    "this probably indicates an increasing range of temperatures in the emission regions .",
    "fits achieved with blackbodies weighted with a @xmath6 or @xmath7 emissivity are almost always less successful than those yielded by pure blackbodies .",
    "newly - condensed iron whiskers having a @xmath66 emissivity also seem unlikely as they would have to form beyond the cds .",
    "we conclude that the ir emission arises from dust in the form of ir - opaque clumps or having a large ( @xmath132 m ) grain size .",
    "+ we have considered possible origins for the strong , post-300  d ir emission . a significant amount of direct heating of condensed ejecta dust by ongoing radioactive decay is ruled out since the observed ir emission exceeds the radioactive luminosity by a substantial factor .",
    "we also rule out the possibility of direct heating of pre - existing csm dust by the shock , since it would not have reached the edge of the dust - free cavity .",
    "x - ray precursor heating of csm dust is also ruled out since it would imply the additional presence of an ir - echo of much greater luminosity than the observations could support .",
    "+ we are therefore left with the ir - echo and condensing dust hypotheses . in favour of the ir - echo explanation , dwek s ( 1983 ) model with a @xmath6 dust emissivity",
    "suggests that the observed ir luminosity could be produced by a slow wind of @xmath510@xmath133m@xmath9  yr@xmath18 which is similar to that indicated by optical , x - ray and radio observations of sn  1998s .",
    "this assumes the typical ism gas - to - dust ratio of 160 in the progenitor csm .",
    "in addition , if we adopt a @xmath6 emissivity law , then condensing dust would be unable to supply sufficient ir luminosity .",
    "however , our measurements tend to disfavour seds weighted with a @xmath6 or @xmath7 emissivity .",
    "moreover , for the ir - echo scenario to work for sn  1998s at @xmath134  d , we must invoke a rather extreme case where at least 20% of the uv - optical luminosity is absorbed by the csm dust .",
    "in addition , against the ir - echo scenario is the disagreement in the observed and predicted decline rates and seds , although it may be possible to eliminate these discrepancies through more detailed ir - echo modelling , including asymmetric and episodic cases . we therefore do not rule out the ir - echo scenario .",
    "at the earlier epoch of 136  d , an ir - echo seems to be the only plausible explanation for the ir luminosity .",
    "+ in favour of the condensing dust hypothesis is the success of the single temperature pure blackbody fits at about 1  year .",
    "dust condensing in optically thick clumps within a physically relatively thin shell symmetrical about the supernova centre - of mass might be expected to exhibit such temperature uniformity .",
    "( light travel time effects would be negligible in this case since even at 2  years the ejecta radius would only be about 10  light days . )",
    "moreover , the coincidence at about 1  year of the blue - peak velocities of the h@xmath2 and hei 1.083  @xmath1 m lines with that derived from the blackbody fits to the ir magnitudes suggests a physical connection .",
    "this is supported by the similar values at about 1  year for the optical depths derived from the h@xmath2 line profile , the hei  1.083  @xmath1 m line profile , and that obtained from the blackbody - derived dust covering fraction .",
    "we suggest that this connection is the cds formed as a result of the ejecta - csm interaction .",
    "it is possible that conditions in the cds would allow the condensation of dust .",
    "moreover the highest blackbody temperature we derive is 1250  k , which is also believed to be compatible with grain condensation , though only slightly higher temperatures may not be ( gehrz 1988 ) . assuming that all the dust at about 1  year is at the same temperature",
    ", we estimate that as early as 1  year , over @xmath13  m@xmath9 had formed . the apparent decrease in the dust mass after about 700  d together with the reduced success of the blackbody fits to the ir sed may indicate that dust condensation was actually still ongoing but that an increasing proportion had cooled to temperatures where the bulk of the flux was emitted beyond nir wavelengths .",
    "given these arguments , we tend to favour dust condensation as the origin of _ both _ the post-300  d ir luminosity and the line profile attenuation .",
    "+ it should be stressed that in the dust condensation scenario , the total dust mass produced could be very much larger than the @xmath135  m@xmath9 lower limit .",
    "most of the dust could have been invisible due to the clump opacities being much higher than that necessary to produce a blackbody spectrum , and increasingly large amounts could have gone undetected due to the cooling of an increasingly large proportion of the dust beyond the reach of the nir observations .",
    "the possibility of very opaque clouds is also raised by elmhamdi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who obtain a somewhat weaker lower limit of @xmath136  m@xmath9 of dust for the type  iip sn  1999em based on the evolution of the [ o  i ]  6300    profile .",
    "in addition , our proposal that dust formed in the cds does not exclude the possibility that dust also condensed deep within in the metal - rich sn ejecta interior .",
    "indeed the presence of a co emission zone on day  115 at a velocity of only 2200  km  s@xmath18 ( fassia et al .",
    "2001 ) suggests that a cool dust - forming environment deep in the ejecta might have developed .",
    "our dust mass lower limit for sn  1998s is consistent with the @xmath50.10.3  m@xmath9 of condensed dust in sn  1987a deduced from metal depletion ( lucy et al .",
    "1991 ; dwek et al .",
    "1992 ; spyromilio & graham 1992 ) . however , sn  1987a was peculiar .",
    "moreover , sne  iin make up only 1015% of all type  ii events ( cappellaro & turatto 2001 ) . of the three ccsne ( 87a , 98s , 99em ) ,",
    "only sn  1999em may be described as ` typical ' , but it is only one event .",
    "it is therefore premature to conclude that high rates of dust condensation occur in all type  ii events .",
    "consequently , the exact significance of sne  ii for cosmic dust production is undecided . for further progress to be made ,",
    "studies such as presented here should be carried out for a statistically significant sample of supernovae , and extended to even longer ir wavelengths .",
    "+ comparison of the @xmath10 evolution for a number of type  ii sne , suggests that this may be a useful tool for discriminating between supernovae whose progenitors possessed or lacked a massive csm .",
    "we propose that the appearance of a strong @xmath10 excess [ @xmath127 ] during the first year is indicative of a massive csm .",
    "the ir flux at this time can be a mixture of emission from cds dust and an ir - echo i.e. , two populations of dust may exist . the newly - formed ejecta dust would be responsible for the attenuation of the red sides of the line profiles .",
    "determination of the relative contributions by the two populations to the ir flux requires good wavelength coverage at late - times , extending as far as the @xmath4 and @xmath0 bands or even further to the mid - ir . for the progenitors of sne which do not show an ir - excess in the 100350  day period ( e.g. , sne  1987a , 2002hh )",
    ", it is much less likely that they were surrounded by a massive csm in their immediate vicinity .",

    "<S> the intensity and rise of the @xmath3 continuum towards longer wavelengths together with the relatively bright @xmath4 and @xmath0 magnitudes shows that the nir emission was due to hot dust newly - formed in the ejecta and/or pre - existing dust in the progenitor circumstellar medium ( csm ) . </S>",

    "<S> more plausible sources are ( a ) an ir - echo from csm dust driven by the uv / optical peak luminosity , and ( b ) emission from newly - condensed dust which formed within a cool , dense shell produced by the ejecta shock / csm interaction . </S>",
