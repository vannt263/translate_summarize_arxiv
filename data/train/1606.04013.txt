    "they reported a well - defined power - law distribution of the avalanche size and characterized the presence of criticality by the pdf of the differences between avalanche sizes at different times ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "the study of complex systems employing network science framework has attracted much interest in many interacting - elements systems @xcite .",
    "several models for studying soc on complex networks have been proposed @xcite . in these models",
    "criticality is produced by a `` fitness '' parameter defined on the nodes or by a rewiring process @xcite .",
    "we present a simple network model that mimics the instability condition of the sandpile models imposing a local stability condition associated to an average property of its neighborhood . this neighborhood assortativity produces soc dynamics driven by the network s topology , namely , a node will become unstable when its degree is greater than a threshold condition ( like in sandpile models ) .",
    "this generalization of sandpile models can describe many interacting - elements system in which the maximum value of the node s property depends on its neighborhood s values .",
    "as far as we know this is the only soc model that is driven exclusively by the network topology ( neither rewiring requirements nor non - topologycal properties associated to the nodes have been used ) .",
    "the model definition and its main features are explained in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "numerical simulations are reported in section [ sec : results ] . in the first part of section [ sec : results ]",
    ", we characterize the neighborhood topology conducted by the stability condition ( introducing the _ neighborhood assortativity _ ) . in the second part , we show a complete characterizations of soc dynamics and we compare our results with the classical ofc model @xcite . in section [ sec : statistics ] we develop the algorithms for the probability distribution by means of the markov chains for a special case where the network is restricted to a linear chain , and compare the results with numerical simulations .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "starting from a single node the network grows by adding a new node ( with a single link ) at each time step , nonetheless a topological stability condition constrains the growth . after a new addition the system can result in an unstable configuration .",
    "this unstable state leads to a relaxation process which , eventually , can end with the removal of nodes .",
    "the interplay between dynamics and topology drives the system .    in this model",
    "the stability of a node depends on the `` support '' of its neighbors as follows : the node s degree must be less than or equal to the average degree of its neighbors plus a global constant ( hereafter _ buffering capacity _ , @xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore the stability condition can be written as follows : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the @xmath5-node s degree , and @xmath6 is the set of nearest neighbors of node @xmath5 .",
    "this inequation may be rewritten as an equation introducing a new local parameter @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a grade of stability , i.e. , the higher @xmath9 the more stable the node is .",
    "we will identify the term @xmath10 as the node s _",
    "activity_. note that @xmath9 is negative for unstable nodes .",
    "when a node becomes unstable , one of its @xmath4 links is randomly removed and the smallest subnet is deleted . since the degree has changed , the stability conditions of the node and its neighbors have to be checked again in an iterative process until every node in the network is stable .",
    "the set of removals nodes performed until every node in the network is stable represents an _",
    "avalanche_. the _ size _ of the avalanche can be defined as the total number of nodes removed from the network .    starting from a single node or a small network",
    "these dynamics make the system evolve towards a finite network whose average size , in the stationary regime , depends on the _ buffering capacity _ constant .",
    "note that this model generates _ tree - like _ networks since one link is added at each time step and there is no rewiring between nodes , thus there are no cycles in the network . moreover , starting from a full - connected network as initial seed after a long time period every cycle will break up ( for any finite @xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , the average number of links is always less than @xmath11 .",
    "these tree - type networks can be found in the tree topology of physical connections on a lan ( hybrid bus and star topologies ) , where a switch can only distribute through a limited number of connections , and also in branching processes such as fractal trees @xcite .",
    "the node s stability condition is related to the average degree of its neighbors .",
    "thus , it will produce networks of positive _ neighborhood assortativity _ , i.e. , the node s degree tends to be similar to the average degree of its neighborhood , as it is shown in the next section .",
    "this condition implies a maximum degree in the network .",
    "this maximum degree depends on the constant @xmath2 .",
    "starting from a single seed , the maximum degree of the network can be increased when the new node is added to a node with the highest degree but connected to neighbors with the same maximum degree . in this case",
    "the new stability condition can be written as : @xmath12    the minimum value of @xmath2 satisfying @xmath13 will be : @xmath14    for example , for @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; for @xmath17 , @xmath18 ; and for @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "dynamically , this model shows four behaviors depending on the global parameter @xmath2 : i ) @xmath21 , whose solution is the trivial _ duple _ since adding a new node is always unstable ; ii ) @xmath22 , generates only linear chains , i.e. , the possible stable configurations require @xmath15 ( this fact will allow us to study statistically this case in section [ sec : statistics ] ) ; iii ) @xmath23 , produces networks with the value of @xmath24 restricted by eq .",
    "[ eq : kmax ] ; however , the average size of these networks is limited to a value dependent on @xmath2 ( as it can be seen in section [ sec : results ] , figure [ fig2:time_evol_n ] ) ; iv ) @xmath25 produces networks without any limit in the maximum degree ( but also with the stationary average size limited to a value dependent on @xmath2 ) .",
    "the limit case @xmath26 allows adding a new node to any node in the network ; all configurations are stable , thus there wo nt be any pruning events and the network will grow without any limit .",
    "we performed numerical simulations starting from a single node and checked that by starting from a different number of nodes , only the statistics at initial time steps change while at the stationary state they stay the same .",

    "this model includes two time scales , a `` slow '' energy income ( one node per time unit , @xmath0 ) and a `` fast '' relaxation process triggered by the stability criterion ( associated to a micro - time ) .",
    "the instability of a node involves the pruning of a link , which can lead to another instability situation at the next `` micro - time '' , and so on , producing eventually an avalanche .",
