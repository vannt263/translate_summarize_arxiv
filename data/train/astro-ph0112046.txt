    "the first - order fermi or diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) has been long considered as responsible for the production of galactic cosmic rays ( crs ) in supernova remnants ( snrs ) , as well as for the radio , @xmath0- and @xmath1-ray emission from these and other shock related objects .",
    "the most crucial characteristic of this process that is usually examined in terms of its capability to explain a given observation , is the rate at which it operates .",
    "indeed , what is often expected from the theory or even inferred from the observations is an extended particle energy spectrum , frequently a power - law , but more rapidly decaying at the highest energies observed .",
    "often , this decay is referred to as an energy or momentum cut - off and is usually associated with the finite acceleration time or with losses if their rate exceeds the acceleration rate .",
    "as long as the losses are unimportant , the cut - off @xmath2 advances with time according to the following equation    @xmath3    whereas in the presence of losses the acceleration rate @xmath4 may be equated to the loss rate to yield a steady state value of @xmath5 .",
    "the acceleration time scale is determined by ( e.g. ,  @xcite )    @xmath6 \\frac{dp}{p}\\ ] ]    with @xmath7 and @xmath8 being the upstream and downstream flow speeds in the shock frame and with @xmath9 being the particle diffusivities in the respective media .",
    "one may recognize in the last formula the sum of average residence times of a particle spent upstream and downstream of the shock front before it completes one acceleration cycle , integrated over the entire acceleration history from @xmath10 to @xmath5 .",
    "given the flow speeds @xmath11 which , in many cases are known reasonably well , the most sensitive quantity is the particle diffusivity @xmath12 .",
    "this , in turn , is determined by the rate at which particles are pitch angle scattered by the alfven turbulence .",
    "if the latter was just a background turbulence in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , the acceleration process would be too slow to produce the galactic crs in snrs ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however it was realized ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) that accelerated particles should create the scattering environment by themselves generating alfven waves on the cyclotron resonance @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the magnitude of the wave vector ( directed along the magnetic field ) , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the particle momentum , the cosine of its pitch angle , mass and non - relativistic ( @xmath19 ) gyro - frequency .",
    "note , that the diffusive character of particle transport ( and determination of @xmath12 ) has been rigorously obtained within a quasi - linear theory , i.e. ,  it is subject to constraints on the turbulence level .    the wave generation , however , proved to be very efficient ( see e.g. ,  @xcite and the next section ) . in particular , using , again , the quasi - linear approximation , the normalized wave energy density @xmath20 may be related to the partial pressure @xmath21 of crs that resonantly drive these waves through    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is",
    "the alfven mach number and @xmath24 is the shock ram pressure .",
    "since @xmath23 is typically a large parameter , @xmath25 may become larger than unity even if the acceleration itself is relatively inefficient , i.e. ,  if @xmath26 . strictly speaking",
    "this invalidates the quasi - linear approach as a means for describing the generation of strong turbulence at shocks .",
    "the commonly accepted way to circumvent this difficulty is to assume that the turbulence saturates at @xmath27 , which means that the m.f.p . of pitch angle scattered particles",
    "is of the order of their gyro - radius @xmath28 .",
    "then , @xmath29@xmath30 , where the speed of light @xmath31 is substituted instead of cr velocity and @xmath32 stands for the bohm diffusion coefficient .",
    "this immediately sets the acceleration time scale ( [ t : acc ] ) at the level of particle gyro - period @xmath33 times @xmath34 . in principle , the turbulence level @xmath25 significantly exceeding unity is possible in local shock environments ( see e.g. ,  numerical studies by @xcite and @xcite ) . as a consequence of",
    "that the diffusion coefficient could be even smaller than @xmath32 , and hence , the acceleration rate would be faster than it is commonly believed to be . at the same time , since usually alfvenic type turbulence is considered , the respective velocity perturbations must be super - alfvenic and supersonic , which raises questions about its ability to sustain itself in an extended area without rapid dissipation that will decrease the @xmath25 level .",
    "likewise , decreasing of turbulence level below the bohm limit , for example due to the finite extent of the turbulence zone upstream , should slow down the acceleration @xcite .",
    "however the acceleration rate given by eq.([t : acc ] ) with @xmath35 was found to be fast enough to explain ( at least marginally ) the acceleration of crs in snrs up to the `` knee '' energy @xmath36 over their life time .",
    "much further optimism has been caused by the studies of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they analyzed the prospects for detection of super - tev emission from nearby snr that should be produced by the decays of @xmath37 mesons born in collisions of shock accelerated protons with the nuclei of interstellar gas .",
    "the expected fluxes were shown to be detectable by the imaging @xmath38erenkov telescopes . moreover",
    ", the egret @xcite detected a lower energy ( @xmath39 ) emission coinciding with some galactic snrs .",
    "the spectra also seemed consistent with the dsa predictions .",
    "one may even argue that the low energy egret data verified one of the most difficult elements of the entire acceleration mechanism , the so called injection .",
    "in essence , this is a selection process ( not completely understood ) whereby a small number of thermal particles become subject to further acceleration ( see @xcite for the latest development of the injection theory and @xcite for a review ) and may be then treated by standard means of the dsa theory that was designed to describe particles with velocities much higher than the shock velocity .",
    "therefore , what seemed left for the theory was to continue the egret spectrum ( that sets the normalization constant , or injection rate ) with some standard dsa slope ( nearly @xmath40 or somewhat steeper ) and to predict the @xmath1-ray flux in the tev range where it could be detected by the @xmath38erenkov telescopes .",
    "unfortunately , despite the physical robustness of the arguments given by @xcite , no statistically significant signal that could be attributed to any of the egret sources was detected .",
    "the further complication is that some critical energy band between gev and tev energies is currently uncovered by available instruments .",
    "therefore , based on these observational results it was suggested ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) that there is probably a spectral break or even cutoff somewhere within this band . however the spectrum above gev energies remains an enigma .",
    "this will be resolved perhaps with the launch of the glast mission and when the new generation of @xmath38erenkov telescopes with lower energy thresholds begin to operate .",
    "however , the discovery of the 100 tev emission from snr1006 @xcite , as well as some other remnants not seen by the egret at lower energies ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a complete discussion ) , although almost universally identified with electrons diffusively accelerated to similar energies , is widely interpreted as a strong support of the mechanism itself .",
    "the above suggests , however , that in reality it might be not as robust as is its simplified test particle version with enhanced turbulence and particle scattering .    in this paper",
    "we attempt to understand what may happen to the spectrum provided that the acceleration is indeed fast enough to access the tev energies over the life time of snrs in question .",
    "our starting point is that the fast acceleration also means that the pressure of accelerated particles becomes significant in an early stage of supernova evolution so that the shock structure is highly nonlinear . at the first glance",
    "this should not slow down acceleration since , according to eq.([delb ] ) , this changes the turbulence _ level _ thus improving particle confinement near the shock front and thus making acceleration faster ( smaller @xmath12 ) .",
    "however , the formation of a long cr precursor ( in which the upstream flow is gradually decelerated by the pressure of crs , @xmath21 ) influences the _",
    "spectral properties _ of the turbulence by affecting the propagation and excitation of the alfven waves .",
    "this effect is twofold .",
    "first the waves are compressed in the converging plasma flow upstream and are thus blue - shifted , eliminating the long waves needed to keep exactly the highest energy particles diffusively bound to the accelerator .",
    "second , and as a result of the first , at highest energies there remain fewer particles than expected so that the level of resonant waves is smaller and hence the acceleration rate is lower .",
    "we believe that these effects have been largely overlooked before which may have substantially overestimated the particle maximum energy in strongly nonlinear regimes .",
    "we use the standard diffusion - convection equation for describing the transport of high energy particles ( crs ) near a cr modified shock .",
    "first , we normalize the distribution function @xmath41 to @xmath42 :    @xmath43    here @xmath0 is directed along the shock normal which for simplicity is assumed to be the direction of the ambient magnetic field .",
    "the two quantities that control the acceleration process are the flow profile @xmath44 and the particle diffusivity @xmath45 .",
    "the first one is coupled to the particle distribution @xmath46 through the equations of mass and momentum conservation    @xmath47    where    @xmath48    is the pressure of the cr gas , @xmath49 is the thermal gas pressure , @xmath50 is its density . the lower boundary in the momentum space",
    ", @xmath51 separates crs from the thermal plasma that is not directly involved in this formalism but rather enters the equations through the magnitude of @xmath46 at @xmath52 which specifies the injection rate of thermal plasma into the acceleration process .",
    "the particle momentum @xmath15 is normalized to @xmath53 .",
    "since we shall be primarily concerned with the wave generation and particle confinement upstream of the discontinuity , we assume that the upstream region is at @xmath54 , so that the velocity profile can be represented in the shock frame as @xmath55 where the ( positive ) flow speed @xmath56 jumps from @xmath57 downstream to @xmath58 across the sub - shock and then gradually increases up to @xmath59 ( see figure  [ fig : ph : plane]a below ) .",
    "we may neglect the contribution of the gas pressure to eq.([mom : c ] ) in the upstream region ( @xmath54 , but not at @xmath60 ) restricting our consideration to the high mach number shocks , @xmath61 .",
    "the gas pressure is retained when treating the sub - shock ( discontinuous part of the shock structure ) which , however , can be simply described by the conventional rankine - hugoniot jump condition ( since @xmath21 does not vary on this scale )    @xmath62    here @xmath63 is the mach number in front of the sub - shock .",
    "when the flow compression in the cr precursor can be considered as adiabatic , this can be expressed through the given far upstream mach number in a standard way , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the flow precompression in the cr precursor .",
    "we shall also set @xmath66 in what follows .    turning to determination of the cr diffusion coefficient @xmath12",
    ", we note that since the cr precursor scale height is @xmath67 , which is @xmath68 much larger than the longest wave in the spectrum @xmath69 we can use a wave kinetic equation in the eikonal approximation for describing the evolution of alfven waves    @xmath70    here @xmath71 is the number of wave quanta and @xmath72 is the wave frequency @xmath73 .",
    "the left hand side has a usual hamiltonian form that states the conservation of @xmath71 along the lines of constant frequency @xmath74 on the @xmath75 plane .",
    "the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "describes the wave generation on the cyclotron instability of a slightly anisotropic particle distribution .",
    "it can be expressed through its spatial gradient .",
    "the resonance condition for the wave - particle interaction contains also the particle pitch angle @xmath76 by means of the following expression @xmath77 which , generally speaking , requires the treatment of particle distribution in two dimensional momentum space ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "a significant simplification can be achieved by the so called `` resonance sharpening '' procedure ( @xcite ) whereby a certain `` optimal '' value of @xmath16 is ascribed to all particles and the resonance condition puts @xmath14 and @xmath15 into a one - to - one relation , i.e. ,  @xmath79 . the second term on the r.h.s . stands for nonlinear wave - particle and wave - wave interactions such as the induced scattering of waves on thermal protons and mode coupling @xcite .",
    "we will suggest a simple model for this nonlinear term in section [ sec : modif ] .    to conclude this subsection",
    "we emphasize that while eqs.([dc1]-[mom : c ] ) already treat the acceleration process and flow structure on equal footing , the fluctuation part given by eq.([wke ] ) must be included in this treatment and , as we shall see in the sequel , it by no means plays a subdominant role in this triad .",
    "there are two aspects of the acceleration where nonlinearity is crucial for its outcome .",
    "the first aspect is the excitation of scattering waves by accelerated particles and the second one is the backreaction of these particles on the shock structure .",
    "the latter is critical both for the particle injection and wave excitation that is , to particle confinement .",
    "indeed , the system [ dc1]-[p_c ] self - consistently describes particle acceleration and the shock structure ( nonlinearly modified by the particle pressure ) only if the particle scattering law is known ( which is contained in the diffusion coefficient @xmath12 ) and the injection rate from the thermal plasma is also known ( the normalization of the particle distribution @xmath41 in eq.([dc1 ] ) ) .",
    "physically , the scattering rate determines the particle maximum momentum @xmath5 , as eq.([t : acc ] ) indicates .",
    "the difficulty , however , is that both the cut - off momentum @xmath5 and the wavenumber cutoff of the scattering turbulence change in time _ simultaneously _",
    "( one controlling the other ) due to the cyclotron resonance condition .",
    "however the speed at which they change has not been calculated self - consistently .",
    "the _ linear _ solution given by eqs.([p : max ] ) and ( [ t : acc ] ) is essentially based on the assumption that @xmath5 is growing due to _ already existing stationary turbulence_. in reality , the particle energy cut - off and the corresponding cut - off on the wave spectrum , as we mentioned , both advance together and , since waves need to grow from a very small background amplitude at each current cut - off position , an additional slow down must be introduced in the entire process .",
    "a good analogy here is the problem of beam relaxation in plasmas @xcite ( where a front on the particle velocity distribution also propagates on self - generated rather than on pre - existing resonant waves ) .",
    "this suggests that the speed of the front in momentum space , as given by eqs.([p : max ] ) and ( [ t : acc ] ) should be reduced by a factor @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the background turbulence amplitude and @xmath82 is the saturated wave amplitude generated by accelerated particles .",
    "as we mentioned , the latter may be associated with @xmath83 so that the acceleration time given by eq.([t : acc ] ) may increase by a factor @xmath84 ( e.g. ,  @xcite estimate @xmath85 ) .",
    "evidently , the additional @xmath86-factor takes care of the time needed for waves to grow before they start to scatter particles with current momentum @xmath15 at the bohm rate .",
    "the above consideration also shows that particles with @xmath87 are confined to the shock through fast pitch angle scattering while particles with @xmath88 are scattered only very slowly due to the absence of self - generated waves and leave the accelerator .",
    "mathematically , this means @xmath89 or @xmath90 .",
    "note that the propagating front solution must produce different ( sharper ) cut - off shape at @xmath91 than approaches based on the pre - existing turbulence , i.e. ,  on a prescribed ( for all @xmath92 @xmath93 , ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "even if the speed and the form of the front at @xmath2 are unknown , the above ansatz allows analytic solution of the system ( [ dc1]-[p_c ] ) @xcite for @xmath87 in the limit of strong shocks @xmath61 , high maximum momentum @xmath5 ( that may slowly advance in time ) and for essentially arbitrary , in particular , bohm @xmath93 dependence for @xmath87 ( as we mentioned , often assumed in numerical studies , however , for all @xmath15 , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the analytic solutions are tabulated e.g. ,  by @xcite and extensively used below .",
    "since waves are generated by accelerated particles upstream in the precursor , the main nonlinear impact on the wave dynamics and thus on @xmath5 must be from the flow pre - compression .",
    "the latter can be characterized by the parameter @xmath94 which is shown in figure  [ fig : bif ] as a function of injection parameter @xmath95 for different maximum momenta @xmath5 .",
    "the injection parameter @xmath95 is related to the normalization of particle distribution function @xmath46 in eq.([dc1 ] ) as    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is the downstream value of @xmath46 . in this form",
    "the injection rate @xmath95 naturally appears as a coefficient in front of the cr pressure in the momentum flux conservation eq.([mom : c ] ) when the cr pressure is normalized to the ram pressure @xmath98 ( see eq.[[pc : norm ] ] in the next section ) .",
    "one aspect of the solution shown in figure  [ fig : bif ] which is important here is that for any given injection rate @xmath95 , the growing maximum momentum @xmath2 will ultimately exceed a critical value , beyond which the test particle regime fails to exist .",
    "( it is natural to assume that the acceleration starts at this regime i.e. ,  where @xmath99 , e.g. ,  point a on figure  [ fig : bif ] ) .",
    "formally , the system must then transit to a much higher @xmath100 that will be still very sensitive to the current values of @xmath101 and @xmath102 as may be seen from figure  [ fig : bif ] ( point b ) .",
    "obviously , the further development of the acceleration process will depend on how the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath5 react to this strong increase of @xmath100 .",
    "one possibility is to assume that simply a constant fraction of the sub - shock plasma is injected so that the injection rate substantially increases because the plasma density at the sub - shock grows linearly with @xmath100 .",
    "then , the system must leave the critical region where the @xmath103 dependence is very sharp or even nonunique and proceed to a highly supercritical regime characterized by higher @xmath95 ( point c ) .",
    "the curve @xmath103 saturates there at the level @xmath104 which in the most straightforward way may be deduced from the condition of the sub - shock preservation , @xmath105 , ( see eq.[[c : r ] ] ) . a general formula for @xmath106 with the @xmath107 scaling as a limiting case may be found in @xcite .",
    "this scenario was realized in many numerical models ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , since they normalized the injection parameter to the plasma density at the sub - shock @xmath108 , which should clearly lead to the @xmath109 scaling .",
    "obviously , the pre - compression @xmath100 and thus the acceleration efficiency will then be insensitive to @xmath95 ( in deep contrast to the case @xmath110 , point b ) since the point @xmath111 is already on the saturated part of the @xmath103 curve .",
    "often , this insensitivity is observed in numerical studies with the parameterized injection rate ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , so it is tempted to conclude that we do not need to know the injection rate very accurately , as soon as it exceeds the critical rate .    however , the injection rate is known to be suppressed by a number of self - regulating mechanisms such as trapping of thermal particles downstream by the injection driven turbulence @xcite and cooling of the downstream plasma in strongly modified shocks .",
    "these effects are believed to more than compensate the compressive growth of plasma density .",
    "recently , these effects have been systematically included in numerical studies by @xcite .",
    "they did not confirm the simple @xmath112 rule .",
    "instead they indicate that in course of nonlinear shock modification accompanied by growing @xmath100 , the injection rate @xmath95 remains remarkably constant @xcite .",
    "moreover , the preliminary results of a new adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) modification of these scheme allowing higher @xmath5 , indicate that the injection efficiency may even begin to decrease with growing @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these self - regulation mechanisms are applicable to both strictly parallel and oblique shocks of which the former ones is clearly an exceptional case .",
    "even slightly oblique shocks have an additional self - regulation of injection via a nonlinearly increasing obliquity .",
    "indeed , since the tangential magnetic field component @xmath113 is amplified at the sub - shock by the factor of @xmath100 , the sub - shock may be strongly oblique even if the shock itself is not .",
    "this leads to exponentially strong suppression of leakage of downstream thermal particles upstream ( for a maxwellian downstream distribution ) since the intersection point of a field line ( the particles sit on ) with the shock front rapidly escapes from these particles .",
    "on the other hand , enhanced particle reflection off the oblique subshock should increase injection .",
    "the inspection of figure  [ fig : bif ] shows that if we ( conservatively ) assume @xmath114 ( ab ) rather than @xmath112 ( ac ) the results will differ dramatically particularly in terms of the injection rate .",
    "note that particle spectra that correspond to the points @xmath115 and @xmath111 also differs very strongly ( see @xcite for graphical examples ) .",
    "what is important for the subject of the present paper is that in both these cases as well as for any other point on the part @xmath116 of the bifurcation curve , the compression @xmath100 is very high .",
    "it has been pointed out by @xcite , that this must have strong impact not only on the injection rate as discussed above , but also on the wave propagation and thus on the particle confinement .",
    "this in turn should lead to significant reduction of the maximum momentum achievable by this acceleration mechanism .",
    "we will quantify these effects in the next section .",
    "returning to eqs.([dc1 ] ) and ( [ wke ] ) , it is convenient to use the wave energy density normalized to @xmath117 and to the energy density of the background magnetic field @xmath118 instead of @xmath71    @xmath119    along with the partial pressure of crs normalized to @xmath120 and to the shock ram pressure @xmath121    @xmath122    using these variables , denoting @xmath123 , assuming a steady state and @xmath124 , eqs.([dc1],[wke ] ) can be rewritten as ( @xcite )    @xmath125    here @xmath126 and the wave intensity @xmath127 is now treated as a funcion of @xmath15 rather than @xmath14 according to the resonance relation @xmath128 .",
    "the cr diffusion coefficient @xmath12 can be expressed through the wave intensity by    @xmath129    where @xmath130 is the bohm diffusion coefficient .",
    "the difference between these equations and those used by , e.g. ,  @xcite is due to the terms with @xmath131 and the @xmath132-term on the r.h.s . of eq.([wke2 ] ) . far away from the sub - shock where @xmath133 , and where the wave collision term is also small due to the low particle pressure @xmath134 , one simply obtains    @xmath135    note , that this shows the limitation of the linear approach in the case of strong shocks @xmath136",
    ". the most important change to the acceleration process comes from the terms with @xmath131 .",
    "indeed , let us recall first how the equation ( [ dc2 ] ) may be treated in the linear case @xmath137 for @xmath54 .",
    "we integrate both sides between some @xmath54 and @xmath138 , which yields    @xmath139    where we denoted @xmath140 for @xmath124 .",
    "although this equation has a formal spatial scale @xmath141 , its only solution is a power law    @xmath142    and thus has no scale ( @xmath143 is an integration constant ) .",
    "it simply states the balance between the diffusive flux of particles upstream ( second term in eq.[[cd : lin ] ] ) and their advection with thermal plasma downstream ( the first term ) .",
    "as we shall see , this balance is possible not everywhere upstream and the physical reason why it appears to be so robust in the case @xmath144 is that flows of particles and waves on the @xmath145-plane ( including the diffusive particle transport ) are both directed along the @xmath0-axis .",
    "if , however , the flow modification upstream is significant ( @xmath146 , @xmath54 ) , the situation changes fundamentally .",
    "figure  [ fig : ph : plane ] explains how the flows of particles and waves on the @xmath145-plane become misaligned even though they are both advected with the thermal plasma .",
    "in fact , the flows separate from each other and , since neither of them can exist without the other ( waves are generated by particles that , in turn , are trapped in the shock precursor by the waves ) they both disappear in some part of the phase space . to understand how this happens we rewrite eqs.([dc2]-[wke2 ] ) in the following characteristic form ( we return to the particle number density @xmath46 )",
    "@xmath147    one sees from the l.h.s.s of these equations that particles are transported towards the sub - shock in @xmath0 and upwards in @xmath15 along the family of characteristics @xmath148 , whereas waves move also towards the sub - shock but downwards in @xmath15 along the characteristics @xmath149 .",
    "as long as @xmath56 does not significantly change the waves and particles propagate together ( along @xmath0-axis ) as e.g. ,  in the case of unmodified shock or far away from the sub - shock where @xmath150 . when the flow compression becomes important ( @xmath131 ) their separation leads to decrease of both the particle and wave energy densities towards the sub - shock . to describe this mathematically ,",
    "let us assume first that the relation ( [ i : lin ] ) between @xmath134 and @xmath151 is still a reasonable approximation even if @xmath152 is nonzero but small . then , integrating eq.([dc2 ] ) again between some @xmath54 and @xmath153 , instead of ( [ cd : lin ] ) we obtain    @xmath154    in contrast to the solution of eq.([cd : lin ] ) the length scale @xmath155 enters the solution of this equation .",
    "this is because it has a nonzero r.h.s . in the next subsection",
    "we obtain the solution of this equation that rapidly changes on a scale @xmath156 .",
    "first we note that @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the total scale height of the cr precursor on which @xmath56 changes .",
    "next , in addition to @xmath0 and @xmath15 , we introduce a fast ( internal ) variable @xmath160 as follows    @xmath161    where @xmath162 is some special curve on the @xmath145 plane which bounds the solution and will be specified later .",
    "we rewrite eq.([cd : int ] ) for    @xmath163    separating fast variable terms on the r.h.s . by replacing    @xmath164 to the leading order in @xmath165 ,",

    "first , we introduce the following notations    @xmath169    eq.([dc : int2 ] ) then can be rewritten as :    @xmath170    and its solution can be thus written as    @xmath171    one sees that the limit in eq.([lim : g ] ) indeed exists and is equal to @xmath172 .",
    "furthermore , eq.([g : intern ] ) describes a transition front on the particle distribution between its asymptotic value @xmath173 at @xmath174 and @xmath175 at @xmath176 .",
    "this front solution establishes as a result of particle losses caused by the lack of resonant waves towards the sub - shock as we argued discussing eqs.([dc3],[wke3 ] ) .",
    "note that according to the ordering in eq.([order ] ) we should set @xmath162 in @xmath177 when solving ( [ dc : int3 ] ) for @xmath178 and we indeed must do it for @xmath179 as well as for all negative @xmath180 . in the limit @xmath174",
    ", however , we may use the result ( [ g : intern ] ) for arbitrary @xmath181 since it remains valid in this case , however , it merely states that in this region the complete solution is represented by its `` external '' part @xmath182 ( eq.[[lim : g ] ] ) .",
    "this , in turn , is yet to be determined .",
    "before we do this in section  [ sec : ext ] we should verify the validity of the internal solution and calculate its unknown function @xmath183 .      the way we resolved eq.([wke2 ] ) for @xmath151 ( see eq.([i : lin ] ) ) may become inadequate for two reasons .",
    "first , the second term on the l.h.s . of eq.([wke2 ] ) may become comparable with the first one .",
    "this problem could be resolved , however , by integrating this equation along the characteristic @xmath149 instead of the @xmath0-axis as we did to obtain eq.([i : lin ] ) .",
    "the matter of bigger concern is that the increase of @xmath152 is obviously has to do with strong shock modification , so that @xmath185 .",
    "clearly , under these circumstances the balance between the l.h.s . of eq.([wke2 ] ) and the pressure term on the r.h.s . leads to impossibly large @xmath151 .",
    "evidently , the second term on the r.h.s . must come into play before this has happened so that the steady state will be maintained by the balance between this term and the pressure term while the l.h.s .",
    "will become sub - dominant .",
    "thus , for @xmath151 we have the following equation    @xmath186    as it is often the case we may assume that the wave collision term @xmath187 and in the long wave limit @xmath188 it is also proportional to @xmath189 ( that means to @xmath190 ) .",
    "the pressure gradient may be estimated as @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the scale height of particles of momentum @xmath15 which we assume for simplicity to be proportional to @xmath15 as in the standard bohm case .",
    "thus , for @xmath151 we have    @xmath193    where @xmath194 characterizes the strength of nonlinear wave interaction . using the last estimate , instead of eq.([cd : int ] )",
    "we have    @xmath195    where @xmath196 . introducing the fast variable @xmath197 ( [ ksi ] ) with @xmath198 instead of @xmath199 , and repeating the derivation in section  [ sec : int ]",
    ", for @xmath200 we obtain the following equation    @xmath201 with the obvious solution    @xmath202    this solution is valid for @xmath203 ( @xmath204 ) whereas at @xmath205 one should use the linear formula ( [ i : lin ] ) for the wave spectral density and thus the solution ( [ g : intern ] ) instead of eq.([g : nlin ] ) .",
    "the uniformly valid solution may be also obtained by using an interpolation between eq.([i : lin ] ) and eq.([i : nlin ] ) for @xmath151 .",
    "we will not need , however , the explicit form of the front transition in the particle distribution in the region @xmath179 which means @xmath206 .",
    "we will merely exploit the fact that this transition is much narrower ( its width is @xmath207 ) than that of the main part @xmath208 in the interval @xmath209 .",
    "the spatial scale of the latter is at least @xmath210 or even broader if the linear approximation ( [ g : bell ] ) can be used , in which case the length scale is determined by the linear damping of alfven waves @xcite .",
    "the only characteristic of the above internal solution that is needed to calculate the external solution @xmath182 is the position of the front transition in @xmath200 on the @xmath145-plane , i.e. ,  we need to calculate the function @xmath162 . to do this we return to eq.([wke3 ] ) .",
    "we solved it by neglecting its l.h.s . and finally arrived at the result for @xmath200 and thus for @xmath151 in eq.([wke3 ] ) that contains the fast variable @xmath197 .",
    "generally , this produces large terms in the next order of approximation coming from the l.h.s . to avoid that we must choose the position of the transition front ( @xmath211 ) in such a way that it coincides with one of the characteristics of the operator on the l.h.s . of eq.([wke3 ] ) , i.e. ,     @xmath212 or    @xmath213 the choice of the concrete characteristic is based on the existence of the absolute maximum momentum @xmath214 beyond which there are neither particles nor waves .",
    "that means    @xmath215 = u_{1}\\frac{p}{p_{\\rm max}}\\ ] ] likewise , the function @xmath162 is defined as    @xmath216      while having obtained the form and the position @xmath162 of the narrow front in the particle distribution @xmath217 we still need to calculate @xmath200 to the right from the front where it decays with @xmath0",
    ". this would be the external solution @xmath182 introduced in the previous subsections .",
    "it is clear that    @xmath218 so that from eq.([cd : int ] ) we have the following equation    @xmath219    the most important information about @xmath182 is contained in @xmath220 for which from the last equation we obtain    @xmath221    where we have introduced @xmath222 by    @xmath223    eq.([g0:eq ] ) can be easily solved for @xmath224    @xmath225    where @xmath111 is a normalization constant that should be determined from matching this solution with that in the region @xmath226 .",
    "however , the function @xmath227 depends on the solution itself .",
    "fortunately , this quantity can be calculated prior to determining @xmath224 and therefore , this solution may be written in a closed form . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us consider a particularly simple case of @xmath228 , and we will turn to the general case afterwards .",
    "clearly , @xmath229 means @xmath230 .",
    "evidently , we may replace @xmath231 in eq.([v : def ] ) by @xmath224 so that for @xmath232 we have @xmath233 .",
    "thus , from eq.([g0:sol ] ) we obtain the following shape of the cut - off near @xmath5    @xmath234    in the rest of the @xmath145-domain where @xmath181 and @xmath15 is not close to @xmath235 , we may assume that the cr diffusion coefficient is close to its bohm value .",
    "indeed , in contrast to the phase space region @xmath206 at each given @xmath145 there are waves generated along the entire characteristic of eq.([wke2 ] ) passing through this point of the phase space and occupying an extended region of the cr precursor , figure  [ fig : ph : plane ] .",
    "we may use then the asymptotic high mach number solution found in @xcite    @xmath236    here @xmath237 is numerically small ( typically @xmath238 ) and this solution without @xmath237-term manifests the balance between the diffusion and convection terms on the l.h.s .",
    "of eq.([dc2 ] ) which is more accurate approximation far upstream where the flow modification ( r.h.s . ) is weak .",
    "the flow profile depends on the form of @xmath93 and for @xmath239 in the internal part of the shock transition @xmath56 behaves linearly with @xmath0 . adopting this solution to the region @xmath240 , we may write    @xmath241 so that for @xmath227 we have    @xmath242 in the bohm case we can use the simplified linear approximation for @xmath56 @xcite , @xmath243 where @xmath244 , @xmath245 and it is implied that the maximum contribution to the particle pressure comes from the momentum @xmath246 ( specified later ) .",
    "now we can express @xmath227 in the form of an error integral    @xmath247\\ ] ]    the algebra further simplifies in two limiting cases ( the second of which has been already mentioned )    @xmath248 this yields the following asymptotic behaviour of @xmath220    @xmath249    this result was obtained for particles with momenta @xmath250 , whereas for @xmath226 we may use the spectra tabulated in @xcite for different @xmath5 , that should be associated now with @xmath246 .",
    "the matching of these two spectra should give the normalization constant @xmath111 in the solution ( [ g0:sol1 ] ) .",
    "this will be the subject of the next section .",
    "a typical solution of the nonlinear acceleration problem with a prescribed maximum momentum @xmath5 calculated using the method of integral equations developed in @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : match ] with the dash - dotted line . since the influence of shock modification on the injection rate is not known for high @xmath5 ( see , however , @xcite , where the values of @xmath251 have been reached ) we have taken the injection rate @xmath252 , i.e. ,  well inside the interval between the points a and c on figure  [ fig : bif ] ( see section  [ sec : signif ] ) .    to calculate an integral spectrum containing both the part modified by the wave compression in the shock precursor as well as its lower energy downstream part ( @xmath253 ) we proceed as follows ( see eq.([g : xp ] ) for the spatial structure of the spectrum ) . in the momentum range @xmath254 we can obviously use the same method of integral equations .",
    "however , the role of maximum momentum is now played not by @xmath5 but by @xmath255 ( i.e. ,  a dynamical cut - off where the maximum contribution to the cr pressure is coming from ) .",
    "furthermore , given @xmath95 and @xmath255 , we calculate the self - consistent flow structure with the precompression @xmath100 shown in figure  [ fig : bif ] as well as the particle spectrum .",
    "the latter is shown in figure  [ fig : match ] with the dashed line .",
    "note , that the spectrum matching point @xmath256 with the cut - off area @xmath257 is now determined and we are ready to obtain the final spectrum by calculating its cut - off part from eqs.([g0:sol],[g0:sol1],[nu : gen ] ) .",
    "the spectrum is drawn with the full line .",
    "the momentum @xmath255 may be obtained now as a point of maximum of the function @xmath258 ( particle partial pressure per logarithmic interval ) from eq.([g0:sol1 ] ) ( upper line ) which yields    @xmath259 it should be clear from our treatment that this formula is valid only when the shock is strongly modified , namely when @xmath260 ( the case we are interested in ) .",
    "since @xmath100 can not exceed @xmath107 , this means that the shock must be sufficiently strong , @xmath261 .",
    "there are at least two reasons to believe that the standard acceleration theory may have estimated the maximum particle energy or the form of the spectrum below it incorrectly .",
    "the first reason is simply a possible conflict with the observations of tev - emission from snrs as we discussed in the introduction section .",
    "the second reason is a theoretical one , that arises naturally from considering the nonlinear response of the shock structure to the acceleration which is exemplified in figure  [ fig : bif ] .",
    "according to this picture , the response is so strong that it is unlikely that the acceleration can proceed at the same rate with no change in physics after such a dramatic shock restructuring ( pre - compression @xmath100 may rise by 1 - 2 orders of magnitudes depending on the mach number ) .",
    "time dependent numerical simulations ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) show that the modifications occur very quickly , and compression is increased substantially even before @xmath262 ( note that this would be consistent with the bifurcation diagram in figure  [ fig : bif ] for initial @xmath263 , where @xmath264 is the ratio of cr number density at the shock to that of the background plasma far upstream ) .",
    "the shock modification , in turn , must follow rather abruptly after the maximum momentum has passed through the critical value .",
    "it was argued recently ( @xcite ) that this should drive crucial acceleration parameters such as the maximum momentum and injection rate back to their critical values which must limit shock modification and settle it at some marginal level , the so called self - organized critical ( soc ) level ( see also @xcite for more discussions of the critical interrelation between the injection , maximum energy and shock structure ) .",
    "mathematically , the soc state is characterized by the requirement of merging of the two critical points on the bifurcation diagram in figure  [ fig : bif ] into one inflection point on the @xmath265 graph .",
    "perhaps the most appealing aspect of this approach is its ability to predict the values of all three order parameters ( injection rate , maximum momentum and compression ratio ) given the only control parameter ( the mach number ) just from our knowledge of the nonlinear response @xmath266 shown in figure  [ fig : bif ] , and no further calculations .",
    "however , the required backreaction mechanisms on the injection and maximum momentum need to be demonstrated to operate .",
    "we have already discussed at a qualitative level how the injection rate is reduced by shock modification .",
    "the subject of this paper has been the reduction of particle momenta related to the formation of a spectral break at @xmath267 , as a result of wave compression in a modified shock precursor .",
    "the position of the spectral break is universally related to the degree of system nonlinearity @xmath100 , since @xmath268 .",
    "hence , the problem seems to be converted to the study of nonlinear properties of the acceleration that are formally known from the analytic solution shown in figure  [ fig : bif ] .",
    "however , the injection rate @xmath95 that is now required for accurate determination of the spectral break @xmath256 through @xmath100 , may currently be obtained only from the soc ansatz .",
    "it should be also mentioned that strong reduction of @xmath256 is obviously not to be expected in oblique shocks , where the resonance relation @xmath269 is approximately preserved due to the compression of @xmath270 simultaneously with @xmath14 .",
    "an equally important problem is that strong losses of particles between @xmath256 and @xmath5 must slow down the growth of @xmath2 due to the reduction of resonant waves . as we argued in section",
    "[ sec : signif ] , this may result in an order of magnitude slower acceleration than one would expect from the standard bohm diffusion paradigm .",
    "consequently the dynamically and observationally significant spectral break @xmath256 may be at least two orders of magnitude below the maximum momentum @xmath5 ( again , depending on @xmath271 ) that could be reached in the unimpeded acceleration which is normally implied in estimates of maximum energy achievable in snrs over their active life time .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned uncertainty in @xmath2 , its relation to the position of the spectral break @xmath268 also needs further clarification . indeed , since @xmath100 depends on a dynamical cut - off @xmath255 which , in general , is linked to @xmath256 and @xmath5 , the latter relation is still implicit .",
    "it can be easily resolved , however , in a supercritical regime ( the saturated part of the @xmath103 dependence in figure  [ fig : bif ] , see also @xcite for details ) , which requires .",
    "] @xmath272 .",
    "one simply has then @xmath273 .",
    "as it was argued , however , the injection is unlikely to be high enough to reach this regime .",
    "an additional argument against it is that the spectral break becomes unrealistically small in the @xmath274 limit , since @xmath275 . in the opposite case @xmath276 , the compression rate saturates at @xmath277 .",
    "note that the injection rate must be still above critical , otherwise @xmath99 .",
    "now we need to specify @xmath255 .",
    "the simple approximation used in the previous section yielded @xmath278 , so that @xmath279 ( independent of @xmath5 ) which may be regarded as a lower bound on @xmath256 .",
    "indeed , the above relation between @xmath255 and @xmath256 may be applied only to the outermost part of the shock transition ( see secs .",
    "[ sec : ext],[sec : connect ] ) .",
    "downstream , the spectrum cuts off very sharply immediately beyond @xmath256 , section  [ sec : int ] .",
    "therefore , the dynamical cut - off @xmath280 and we obtain the following upper bound on @xmath256 , @xmath281 .    it should be clear that unless @xmath95 is dramatically reduced as a result of shock modification , even this upper bound places @xmath256 way below @xmath5 .",
    "this may be the reason for non - detection of protons at tev energies in snrs .",
    "finally , this does not contradict to the detection of 10 - 100 tev electrons in e.g. ,  snr 1006 since they may be accelerated by other mechanisms ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) or may have higher radiation efficiency .    this study is supported through ucsd by the us department of energy , grant no .",
