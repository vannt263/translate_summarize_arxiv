    "it is widely expected that the large hadron collider  ( lhc ) , which started very successfully on the 10th september 2008 with single beam injection , will uncover physics beyond the present standard model  ( sm ) of particle physics .",

    "are the potential to overcome the hierarchy problem , to provide a dark matter candidate and make a unification of gauge coupling constants at a high energy scale possible",
    ". if the susy mass scale is in the sub - tev range , already first lhc data will likely be sufficient to claim a discovery of new physics although new physics do not strictly mean susy as other new physics scenarios can have similar features and properties . in order to distinguish different scenarios of new physics and to determine the full set of model parameters within one scenario as many measurements of the new observed phenomena as possible are needed .",
    "this includes the precise measurement of masses , spins and cp properties of the newly observed particles .",
    "both multi - purpose experiments at the lhc , atlas@xcite and cms@xcite , are designed for these measurements .",
    "they will be able to pin down the exact model of new physics , e.  g. to distinguish susy from universal extra dimensions  ( ued ) .",
    "in the following we assume r - parity conservation . as a consequence sparticles can only be produced in pairs and the lightest susy particle  ( lsp ) is stable , which usually escapes detection in high - energy physics detectors . at lhc energies mostly pairs of squarks or gluinos are produced in proton - proton collisions , which then subsequently decay via long cascades into the lsp .",
    "typical event topologies at the lhc are multi jet events with zero or more leptons and missing transverse energy due to the two lsps . in the case of atlasthese events",
    "will be triggered using a combined jet and missing @xmath0trigger .",
    "the selection is mainly based on four jets ( @xmath1{gev}$ ] , @xmath2{gev}$ ] ) and missing @xmath0(@xmath3{gev } ,   0.2{\\ensuremath{m_\\mathrm{eff}}}$ ] ) .",
    "the effective mass , @xmath4 , is the scalar sum of missing @xmath0and the transverse momentum of the four leading jets . for further details",
