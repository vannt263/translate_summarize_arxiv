    "the one remaining object ( 7c  1748 + 6703 ) is probably at @xmath8 .",
    "line contamination of continuum magnitudes is expected to be small in nearly all the 7c objects , as the correlation of emission line and radio luminosities means that , on average , emission line fluxes will be much less than those from objects in radio - brighter samples .",
    "whereas the @xmath74 objects studied by eales & rawlings ( 1996 ) typically have line contaminations of a few tens of percent , the 7c objects , which are selected at radio fluxes about four to five times lower , should have line contaminations @xmath75 % .",

    "the seeing during most of our irtf observations was very good , and it was clear from looking at the images that there was a wide range in the scale sizes of the hosts .",
    "we therefore selected a subsample consisting of the 15 sources with grade @xmath71 or @xmath77 redshifts in the range @xmath79 in lacy et al .",
    "( 1999b ) for which we had irtf images .",
    "although not complete , this sample should be representative of the 7c objects in this redshift range . to estimate the scale sizes we convolved model elliptical ( de vaucouleurs ) galaxies having a range in half - light radius @xmath80 from 0.1 to 6.7 arcsec and zero ellipticity with a psf from a nearby star in each irtf image .",
    "the model was subtracted from the data and the minimum in the sum of the squares of the residuals found , along with the approximate @xmath81 range .",

    "although this is far from a full host galaxy model ( in particular we made no attempt to discriminate between disc and de vaucoulours fits ) , we feel that it should give a fair estimate of the scale size , and was all that the signal : noise in the images typically justified .",

( 2000 ) derive very similar mean values of @xmath83 for the 6c radio galaxies at @xmath14 and nearby radio galaxy hosts respectively , so this value has been assumed to correct the mean scale sizes quoted in section 4 by multiplying the scale size by the square root of the axial ratio corresponding to @xmath84 , namely @xmath85 .    for two objects we have been able to compare the scale sizes with those measured on images taken with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "7c  1758 + 6719 ( @xmath86 ) was observed with wfpc2 through the f702w filter ; details of the observations will be given in a future paper ( lacy et al .  in preparation ) .",

    "7c  1754 + 6420 @xmath89 was observed through the f675w filter ( ridgway & lacy in preparation ) .",
    "again , the rest - frame uv emission was better fit by a disk than a de vaucouleurs profile . in this case",
    "the scale size came out significantly smaller than the estimate from the irtf image , 0.7 arcsec in the hst image compared to a best fit of 4.5 arcsec and a range of 1.6  13 arcsec for the irtf image .",
    "this was despite the subtraction of a nearby companion to the south which was successfully removed from both the hst and irtf images .",
    "the cause of this discrepancy is not clear .",
    "this image had the worst seeing of any of our irtf images ( 1.1 arcsec ) , but the scale size measured in the irtf image is much larger than the seeing hwhm .",
    "the radial profile of the irtf image is , however , not at all well fit by the disk model from the hst image .",
    "therefore perhaps the most likely cause of this discrepancy is that the galaxy has a uv - bright disk component embedded in a much larger scale - size elliptical .      to increase the number of high redshift objects in our study we have added the results of photometry of @xmath90 radio galaxies by van breugel et al .",
    "we also estimated scale sizes from their figure 2 for objects which appeared to be dynamically - relaxed ellipticals ( seven out of the eight of their radio galaxies with @xmath91 ) .",
    "we applied @xmath23- and aperture corrections in a consistent manner to that for the 7c - iii radio sources .",

    "thus the only selection effect which needs to be considered for these samples is the tendency for redshift and luminosity to correlate within each flux limited sample . with the wide range in radio luminosities in the complete samples at @xmath14 , however , we can separate out the luminosity dependence .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  4 , where we have plotted absolute magnitude against radio luminosity for 3c , 6c and 7c galaxies in the redshift range @xmath121 .",
    "in this redshift range the mean magnitude in 3c is @xmath122 , whereas in 6c it is @xmath123 and in 7c - iii @xmath124 .",

    "( 1998 ) where preliminary @xmath13-band photometry on the 7c - i and 7c - ii samples is presented ] .",
    "we can think of two possible explanations for this radio luminosity dependence of host magnitude at @xmath14 .",

    "rigler et al .  (",
    "1992 ) , however , show that the fraction of emission from @xmath14 3c radio galaxies which is aligned with the radio jet axis , and therefore probably closely related to the agn activity , contributes only @xmath125% of the light in the observed @xmath13-band .",
    "also , simpson , rawlings & lacy ( 1999 ) argue that reddened quasar light is responsible for @xmath75% of the observed near - infrared emission from 3c radio galaxies on the basis of 3@xmath126 m imaging .",
    "thus we believe that only @xmath127 per cent of the host luminosity can be accounted for by the agn , not the @xmath128 per cent required to explain the higher host luminosities of the 3c galaxies .",
    "the second possibility is that the radio luminosity may be correlated with the mass of the host .",
    "this could arise , for example , if correlation of black hole mass and the mass of the spheroidal component of galaxies which is claimed to be present at low redshift ( e.g.  magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) is appearing at the highest radio luminosities ( roche et al .",
    "we have argued ( lacy , ridgway & trentham 2000 ; see also willott et al .",
    "1999 ) that most radio galaxies are sub - eddington accretors , but at the highest luminosities corresponding to the highest black hole masses , even the radio galaxies may be accreting at near eddington rates . thus at these highest luminosities we might expect a host galaxy mass  agn luminosity ( and therefore host luminosity ) correlation to appear . also , the mass of the host may correlate with the density of the intergalactic medium confining the radio source , which would enhance the radio luminosity .",
    "we have made a crude model of the luminosity dependence by assuming a contribution from agn - related light to a base host optical luminosity @xmath129 .",
    "we model this contribution as a combination of a component due to emission lines and another component due to other agn - related light .",
    "( we separate the emission line contribution , as the equivalent width of the emission lines is a strong function of redshift , unlike the other agn - related emission which we expect to be much less redshift dependent . )",
    "both these components should be proportional to the agn luminosity , which we assume to be proportional to @xmath130 to the power 0.8 ( serjeant et al .",
    "1998 ; willott et al .  1999 ) , i.e. @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the contribution of agn - related light other than emission lines and @xmath133 is the contribution due to emission lines .",
    "the base host luminosity at @xmath134 was set to @xmath135 , or @xmath136 , close to the mean of the 7c and 6c data , and @xmath137 fit by eye to be @xmath138 ( fig .",
    "the emission line contribution to the total near - infrared luminosities of the 3c radio galaxies at these redshifts is @xmath139% ( rawlings et al .  1997 ; rawlings eales & lacy 1990 ) , or about 20% of the overall luminosity - dependent correction .",
    "we have therefore set @xmath140 and @xmath141 .    using this formula we can then correct the host magnitudes for agn - related light and produce plot of @xmath129 versus redshift .",
    "[ rather than attempt to model the redshift dependence of @xmath77 we have used emission line contamination estimates from eales & rawlings ( 1997 ) and van breugel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to explicitly correct the magnitudes in the 6c and high redshift samples ( where these were unknown the object was omitted from the plot and correlation analysis ) , and our own estimates to correct the 7c - iii magnitudes . ]",
    "the results are shown in fig .  5 , which shows that there is indeed a correlation of @xmath129 with redshift .",
    "this was confirmed using the kendall tau statistic generalized to include limits , as implemented in the iraf.stsdas program bhkmethod ( isobe & feigelson 1990 ) , which returned a @xmath142 for the 106 objects from the 3c , 6c , 7c and hz samples after correction .",
    "this corresponds to a probability that there is _ no _ correlation between @xmath129 and redshift of @xmath143 .",
    "however , this probability increases to 0.13 if the hz sample is removed .",
    "we have also conducted the same statistical test before correction for radio luminosity - dependent effects in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "this gave a @xmath144 and a probability of no correlation of @xmath143 , removing the hz sample reduced this to @xmath145 , again with the probability of no correlation of @xmath143 .",
    "the low scatter in the magnitudes of radio galaxies in the @xmath12 hubble diagram out to @xmath146 has long been used as an argument for a high redshift of radio galaxy formation ( e.g.  lilly 1989 ) .",
    "this low scatter is thought to come about because radio galaxies form at @xmath37 then evolve along similar passive evolution tracks to end at radio galaxy hosts today . with a few modifications this simple picture still seems to be basically valid .",
    "fig .  3 and table 4 show that the dispersion in absolute magnitudes to @xmath10 is indeed very low .",
    "after correction for agn - contamination , however , the dispersion in @xmath129 for the @xmath26 objects seems to be higher than for the uncorrected objects ( table 4 ) . as discussed above ,",
    "the correlation of absolute magnitude with redshift is also less tight after correction .    at first sight",
    "it seems paradoxical that correction for luminosity - dependent effects should _ increase _ the scatter in the absolute magnitudes .",

    "( the @xmath26 objects have a very narrow range in @xmath148 as the range in flux of these objects is low , all except vla 123642 + 621331 having 151 mhz fluxes between 0.5 and 10 jy . )",
    "the addition of the luminosity - dependent contributions can then boost the objects with low @xmath129 by a significant factor , whereas the addition to the objects with high @xmath129 results in only a relatively small fractional increase in the luminosity ( see also de vries 1999 ) .",
    "the result of this is a reduction of the scatter in the total luminosities .",

    "( 1998 ) studies , which lead to poor scale size estimates , combined with small number statistics in the roche et al .",

    "using the 7c , 6c , 3c ( @xmath121 ) and hz samples there is a weak anticorrelation of scale size with redshift , significant at about the 5% level using the bhkmethod .",
    "inspection of fig .  7 , and the comparison to low redshift frii hosts , shows that the scatter in scale sizes is large at all redshifts , and suggests that any evolution in scale size is weak .",
    "fri hosts at low redshift , however , have significantly brighter hosts and larger scale sizes at a given radio luminosity ( e.g.  owen & ledlow 1994 ) , suggesting that merging in the richer cluster environments associated with these objects may be significant if they are the descendents of more luminous sources at high redshift . an argument against this",
    "is provided by a recent study of brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) by burke , collins & mann ( 2000 ) , who show that , when selection effects are properly taken into account , the bcgs of the most x - ray luminous clusters brighten with redshift ( to a similar extent as the frii hosts , in fact ) , and thus there is little evidence of significant merger activity for redshifts @xmath176 . however , because the frii hosts are significantly less luminous than bcgs , mergers that would enhance the luminosity of a bcg by only a few percent would enhance that of an frii host by a much larger factor .",
    "nevertheless , the lack of evidence for merger activity in even rich clusters suggests that frii hosts , which are generally found in poor cluster environments ( e.g.  wold et al .",
    "2000 ) , are probably not significantly affected by merging , at least at @xmath177 .      to demonstrate that the redshift dependence of host magnitude is independent of the assumed cosmology we have plotted in fig .  8 the effective surface brightness ( defined here as the flux within @xmath80 divided by @xmath178 converted into magnitudes ) in the rest - frame @xmath22-band versus redshift for the sub - sample of 7c - iii galaxies with estimated scale sizes .",
    "we have compared this to the cosmological surface brightness dimming expected in a standard expanding universe with a friedmann - robertson - walker metric .",
    "the surface brightness decreases with redshift much less rapdly than the prediction for a non - evolving stellar population ( solid line in fig .",
    "this demonstrates that the brightening of the hosts with redshift is a real evolutionary effect , and not one produced by an incorrect choice of @xmath179 and @xmath32 .",
    "the evolution of host magnitude and rest - frame surface brightness with redshift , the lack of strong evolution in scale sizes in the subset of objects with `` undisturbed '' morphologies , and the low scatter ( @xmath180 magnitude ) in the absolute magnitudes up to at least @xmath8 are all consistent with an early formation epoch ( @xmath146 ) for most , and perhaps all , radio galaxy hosts . at first sight these results are in conflict with standard cdm - based models for galaxy formation , in which hierarchical structure formation occurs in a `` bottom up '' fashion with the most massive galaxies forming late .",
    "radio galaxies at @xmath2 are much brighter than the average quasar host predicted by the models of kauffmann & haehnelt ( 2000 ) , for example . to compare our radio galaxy sample to these predictions we have assumed an equivalent quasar luminosity equal to the mean of the @xmath181 7c quasars , @xmath182 ( willott et al .",

    ") hosts with clumpy structures aligned with the radio source axis become much more common objects being observed at shorter rest - frame wavelengths , as lower redshift objects observed at the same rest - frame wavelengths as the @xmath37 objects still look like relaxed ellipticals . ] .",
    "second , the detection rate of continuum submillimeter emission from hot dust seems to rise rapidly at @xmath190 ( archibald et al .",
    "the 6c and 7c samples are completely identified with luminous host galaxies out to at least @xmath191 , however , which would suggest the bulk of the stars had formed and/or merged onto the host by @xmath8 .",
    "one way around a high formation redshift for all objects would be to assume a systematic delay between a host forming the bulk of its stars and the switching on of powerful radio jets ( for example , if the black hole needs time to accrete enough mass ) .",
    "radio galaxies would then always be seen with luminous hosts . however , the strong evolution in the hosts seen by van breugel et al .",
    "around @xmath8 suggests that their nature is still changing up to at least that epoch .",
    "taken together , the evidence suggests that the epoch of radio galaxy host formation was essentially over by @xmath8 , in the sense that most objects had formed the bulk of their stars , although further star - formation and merger activity continued in many objects up to @xmath2 .",
    "as radio galaxies can be found out to @xmath192 , however ( van breugel et al .   1999 ) , and there is no sign of a substantial drop in the space density of radio galaxies out to @xmath5 relative to their peak space density at @xmath193 ( jarvis et al .",
    "1999 ) , this formation epoch must last at least a gyr .",
    "in contrast , field ellipticals with evolved stellar populations and luminosities @xmath194 seem to become rarer at @xmath195 ( zepf 1998 ; barger et al .",
    "1999 ; dickinson 1999 ) , suggesting a later formation epoch , perhaps @xmath196 .    a recent variation on the hierarchical models , the so - called anti - hierarchical baryonic collapse model ( granato et al .",
    "2000 ) may be able to explain these observations .",
    "this predicts that the massive hosts of powerful agn may have formed at @xmath8 .",
    "this model uses the same cdm assumptions as the standard scenarios , but assumes that the dense gas in the most massive haloes can collapse and form stars in a massive spheroidal component more rapidly than that in the smaller haloes associated with normal galaxies .",
    "star formation is switched off in these objects by winds from the agn and the starburst at high redshift .",

    "<S> we present new near - infrared images of @xmath0 radio galaxies from the flux - limited 7c - iii sample of radio sources for which we have recently obtained almost complete spectroscopic redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the 7c objects have radio luminosities @xmath1 times fainter than 3c radio galaxies at a given redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute magnitudes of the underlying host galaxies and their scale sizes are only weakly dependent on radio luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> radio galaxy hosts at @xmath2 are significantly brighter than the hosts of radio - quiet quasars at similar redshifts and the model agn hosts of kauffmann & haehnelt ( 2000 ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is no evidence for strong evolution in scale size , which shows a large scatter at all redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the hosts brighten significantly with redshift , consistent with the passive evolution of a stellar population that formed at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is consistent with studies of host galaxy morphology and submillimeter continuum emission , both of which show strong evolution at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of a strong `` redshift cutoff '' in the radio luminosity function to @xmath5 suggests that the formation epoch of the radio galaxy host population lasts @xmath6 gyr from @xmath7 to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest these facts are best explained by models in which the most massive galaxies and their associated agn form early due to high baryon densities in the centres of their dark matter haloes . </S>"
