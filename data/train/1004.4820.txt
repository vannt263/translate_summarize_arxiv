    "electromagnetic metamaterials have recently attracted significant research attention due to their unique properties generally not available in standard media .",

    ", the research on the nonlinear metamaterials can overcome the limits of the naturally - occurring materials and can expand the range of possible applications @xcite . as a leading example , the artificial fabrication of nonlinear materials suggested the way to enhanced the nonlinearity at low intensity .",

    "the nonlinearity is to reduce the linear polarization . following this strategy , ciattoni et al .",
    "@xcite suggested a simple composite structure to achieve very small value of dielectric permittivity where the nonlinear contribution to the dielectric response is not a mere perturbation of the linear one ( extreme nonlinear regime ) .",
    "authors considered a nanoscaled layered structure consisting of alternating metal and dielectric slabs and , in the effective medium scheme , characterized by effective constitutive relations formally coinciding with those of a standard kerr medium and with response parameters assuming values not available in standard media ( nonlinear metamaterials ) . in these kind of metamaterials ,",
    "transverse magnetic nonlinear guided waves show a very rich and exotic phenomenology such as the transverse power flow reversing ( i.e. the power flow of the considered waves changes its sign along the wave transverse profile , see also ref.@xcite ) .    ) . ]    in this paper , we consider specific transverse magnetic nonlinear guided waves propagating in a nonlinear epsilon - near - zero metamaterial and characterized by a power flow exactly vanishing in a core region and exhibiting a sharp sloped profile at the edges of the side regions surrounding the core .",
    "the very marked steepening of the power flow and of the underlying electric field transverse component @xmath0 is a consequence of the vanishing of the transverse component of the displacement field along the transverse wave profile , i.e. @xmath1 . since @xmath2 is nonlinearly related to @xmath0 and @xmath3 , this requirement is differently fulfilled within the core ( where @xmath4 ) and the lateral regions ( where the effective nonlinear dielectric permittivity vanishes ) thus yielding a discontinuity of the transverse field derivatives at the core edges .",
    "such an extreme electromagnetic configuration has , as a main underlying physical mechanism , the exact compensation between linear and nonlinear contributions to the dielectric response in the regions surrounding the core and this is possible since the considered medium can support the extreme nonlinear regime .",

    "all effective parameters appearing in the relation ( [ h - d ] ) can be tailored by choosing the underlying constituents ; for example the averaging of the dielectric permittivity can be used to obtain an efficient loss management ( using gain and loss media as underlying layers ) @xcite and/or an epsilon - near - zero metamaterials ( exploiting negative and positive dielectric layers ) @xcite .",

    "it is worth noting that the relation @xmath72 can be satisfied only if @xmath99 and @xmath100 , so that the occurrence of discontinuities in the field spatial derivatives is a signature of the extreme nonlinear regime where the nonlinear term appearing in the first of eqs.([h - d ] ) is comparable with @xmath101 , the linear part of the displacement field .",

    "in addition the power flow is transversally confined since @xmath107 for @xmath108 as a consequence of the fact that , asymptotically , @xmath109 .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the formation of optical hollow - core waves in epsilon - near - zero metamaterials .",
    "the existence of hollow - core waves characterized by a power flow exactly vanishing at a central region is the signature of the extreme nonlinear regime where the linear and nonlinear contributions to the overall medium dielectric response are comparable .",
