    "for some semiconductors , at low temperatures and high density , electrons and holes condense into electron - hole drops , which provide a good testing ground for understanding effects of electron - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "some of the semiconductors ( and also semimetals ) that electron - hole drops form in @xcite , such as si , ge , and diamond have conduction band minima near the brillouin zone boundary , for example si has six degenerate valleys , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sibandstructure ] , a ge - si alloy has ten degenerate valleys , and @xmath4 has twelve valleys in the @xmath5 band @xcite .",
    "when the material is strained , valley degeneracy reduces @xcite , which can be experimentally probed @xcite , meaning that valley degeneracy could be regarded as a control parameter . because of this , as well as degeneracy being large in some semiconductors , valley degeneracy might be a good parameter with which to formulate a theory of electron - hole drops .",
    "previous theoretical analyses of electron - hole drops @xcite used an expansion of the energy density with parameters found from separate energy calculations @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to assume that each valley contains a different type of fermion , denoted by an additional quantum number , which we shall call the _ flavor _ , the total number of flavors ( valleys ) is @xmath6 .",
    "further motivation to study flavors stems from the fact that in some previous studies of multiply degenerate systems the number of flavors has not been well defined , for example heavy fermions @xcite , charged domain walls @xcite , a super - strong magnetic field @xcite , and spin instabilities @xcite .",
    "cold atom systems in optical lattices @xcite have a well defined number of flavors but weak interactions between particles . in electron - hole drops",
    "however the number of flavors is well defined and interactions are strong .",
    "the ground state energy and pair correlation function of a free many - flavor electron gas ( mfeg ) were examined using a numerical self - consistent approach for the local field correction by @xcite , and superconductivity was studied by @xcite . following the method of @xcite",
    ", @xcite studied the behavior of the free mfeg by summing over all orders of green s function contributions , they found an exact expression for the correlation energy of a mfeg ( which dominates the interacting energy in the extreme many - flavor limit ) .",
    "this paper describes the derivation of a more versatile formalism , based on a path integral , which gives an exact expression for the total energy of the mfeg ; the theory could apply with as few as six flavors where the exchange energy assumed small by @xcite would be significant .    as well as studying the uniform case , the previously unstudied density response of a mfeg not constrained to be uniform",
    "is investigated .",
    "the screening length - scales of the mfeg are shown to be short relative to the inverse fermi momentum , suggesting that a local density approximation ( lda ) might be a good approximation , motivating a gradient approximation .",

    "the local band curvature governs the electron effective mass , the band structure is often such that the holes relax into a single valence band minimum at the @xmath12 point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sibandstructure ] ) ; here holes are assumed to be heavy and spread out uniformly providing a jellium background .",
    "the thomas - fermi approximation predicts a screening length @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi surface .",
    "the dos is dependent on the number of flavors as @xmath15 and so @xmath16 .",
    "the ratio of the inverse fermi momentum length - scale to the screening length varies with number of flavors as @xmath17 .",
    "this paper takes the many flavor limit @xmath18 , in which the screening length is smaller than the inverse fermi momentum , @xmath19 , the many - flavor limit therefore means that the wave vectors of the strongest electron - electron interactions obey @xmath20 , this is the opposite limit to the rpa which assumes that @xmath21 .",

    "the dos of a particular flavor @xmath30 shrinks as @xmath31 whereas the dos of all flavors grows since @xmath32 . with increasing flavors , more electrons are within @xmath33 of the fermi surface hence are able to be thermally excited , therefore the heat capacity of the mfeg , @xmath34 , increases with number of flavors .",
    "the stoner criterion @xcite for band ferromagnetism states that for opposite spin electrons interacting with positive exchange energy @xmath35 , ferromagnetism occurs when @xmath36 . with increasing number of flavors",
    "the total dos @xmath37 increases so that the stoner criterion becomes more favorable .",
    "however , this analysis does not take into account the curvature of the dos at the fermi surface which can be an important factor in determining whether ferromagnetism occurs @xcite .",
    "the effect of the total dos is also seen in the paramagnetic susceptibility , this is proportional to the total dos at the fermi surface so is expected to increase with number of flavors .",
    "analogously one can compare a transition metal with narrow @xmath38-bands that leads to a large dos at the fermi surface with a simple metal that has broader free electron conduction bands and so a lower dos at the fermi surface . similar to many flavor systems , transition metals are experimentally observed @xcite to have a significantly higher specific heat capacity and greater magnetic susceptibility than typical simple metals .",
    "the simple scaling relationships with number of flavors for heat capacity and magnetization provide additional motivation to analyze a mfeg in more detail .",
    "this paper uses the atomic system of units , that is @xmath39 , but is modified so that @xmath40 denotes an appropriate effective mass for the electron - hole bands , which is the same for all valleys .",
    "this mass @xmath41 can be expressed as a multiple of the electron mass @xmath42 and the dimensionless effective mass @xmath3 .",

    "in the standard expression for the polarizability the fermi - dirac distribution would contain the energy spectrum @xmath53 but in the mfeg each electron is in a particular valley so the polarizability should be re - expressed in terms of the energy dispersion of each valley @xmath23 ( see fig .",

    "shows that a large coulomb potential energy penalty @xmath55 inhibits exchange between different valleys so that the kronecker delta @xmath56 removes cross - flavor terms , and as all of the conduction valleys have the same dispersion a factor of @xmath6 will replace the remaining summation over valleys .",

    "[ sec : freecoulombgas ] it is shown that the typical momentum exchange @xmath58 is large relative to the fermi momentum , therefore the two volumes in momentum space of integration variable @xmath26 , defined by the two fermi - dirac distributions are far apart relative to their radii @xmath59 , and the temperature is sufficiently low so that the high energy tails of the two distributions have negligible overlap . within these approximations the simple form for the polarizability is @xmath60 this expression agrees with the many - flavor polarizability found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the standard lindhard form for the polarizability , when taken in the same @xmath61 limit as imposed by the many - flavor system agrees with eqn .  .",
    "in the static limit where frequencies are small compared to the momentum transfer @xmath62 , the polarizability varies as @xmath63 . in this limit , one green s function is restricted by the sum over matsubara frequencies to lie inside the fermi surface whilst the other gives the polarizability dependence of @xmath64 due to the excited electron s kinetic energy .",
    "the derivation of the polarizability accounted only for intra - valley scattering , which means that in the mfeg the same terms contribute @xcite as in the rpa for the standard electron gas .",

    "the interacting energy of a standard electron gas with a single flavor @xcite is more negative than that of a mfeg , which in turn is more negative than that of a bose condensate @xcite , this could be due to the reducing negativity of the exchange energy , important in the single flavor system , but zero in the bose condensate .",
    "in these two extreme systems , the single flavor electron gas and the bose condensate , there is no notion of valley degeneracy , and therefore the intermediate system , the mfeg , might be expected at most to have only a weak dependence on number of valleys .",
    "in fact , the interacting energy of the mfeg , over the range of density found in sec .  [ sec : densitylimits ] , contains no dependence on the number of valleys .",

    "the non - interacting energy term @xmath114 favors low electron density , the interacting term @xmath115 favors high electron density , therefore the total energy per particle has a minimum as a function of density of @xmath116 at @xmath117 .",
    "the presence of a minimum in energy with density of the mfeg is consistent with the results of @xcite and @xcite who analyzed conduction electrons in a semiconductor .",

    "the upper and lower critical density limits can be combined to conclude that the many - flavor limit result for interacting energy applies for densities that obey @xmath128 ; this density range increases as @xmath129 with number of flavors , the scaling relationship is the same as the applicable density range of the correlation energy found by @xcite , though they did not provide estimates of numerical factors .    using the above high and low density limits it is possible to estimate the minimum number of flavors required for the theory to apply .",
