    "what is the geometry of the universe ? has the universe a memory of its quantum and relativistic origin ?    in 1965 sakharov indicated that quantum primordial fluctuations should have expanded towards the present epoch leading first to classical energy - density perturbations and , after the decoupling from the cosmological background , to the observed galaxies , clusters and superclusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "a relevant contribution was given by l.nottale starting from 1993 .",
    "in many papers he extends einstein s principle of relativity to scale transformations in the framework of the theory of scale relativity .",
    "in particular , he showed that a continuous but non differentiable space - time is necessarily fractal @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this work",
    ", we present a complementary approach starting from the well  known random walk equation or brownian motion relation that was firstly used by eddington @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "following this line we arrive at a self - similar universe ; which was firstly considered by the swedish astronomers charlier @xcite . by taking into account a generalization of compton wavelength rule",
    ", the model realizes a segregated universe , where the sizes of astrophysical structures can fit the observations ( e.g. cobe , iras , and surveys of large scale structures @xcite ) .",
    "the idea , that a rule can exist among the fundamental constants , was presented by dirac and by eddington ",
    "weinberg , but these rules were exact at universe scale or subatomic scale . here , a scale invariant rule is presented . thanks to this relation the universe appears self similar and its self similarity is governed by fundamental quantum quantities , like the plank constant _ h _ , and relativistic constants , like the speed of light _",
    "c_.    actually , there are some theories of gravity which are obtained from the einstein - hilbert gravitational action by adding scalar fields or curvature invariants of the form @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , in the weak - limit approximation , all these theories fit very well with the experiments of einstein s general relativity ( tested only in this limit ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , the observations show a structure of universe with scaling rules , where we can see globular clusters , single clusters or superclusters of galaxies , in which stars can be treated as massive point - like constituents of a universe mad of dust .    why does the universe appear with fixed scales , where matter can be clustered ?",
    "the right question is not the previous one , but the following one : does the universe have quantum nature at all scales ?",
    "it appears that the universe has a memory of its quantum origin like as suggested by r.penrose with respect to quasi - crystal @xcite .",
    "particularly , it is related to penrose tiling and thus to @xmath4 theory ( cantorian spacetime theory ) as proposed by m.s .",
    "el naschie @xcite,@xcite as well as in a.connes noncommutative geometry @xcite .",
    "some remarks are presented about the segregation of the universe with respect to an eddington  weinberg  like relation ( @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the newton gravitational constant , @xmath7 is the mass of nucleon , @xmath8 is the radius of the universe and @xmath9 is the quantum unit of action ) . in particular",
    ", we analyze the scale invariant law @xmath10 , where @xmath8 is the radius of the astrophysical structures , @xmath9 is the planck constant , @xmath11 is the total mass of the self - gravitating system , @xmath12 the speed of light , @xmath13 the number of nucleons into the structures and @xmath14 .",
    "this relation is the compton wavelength for @xmath15 .",
    "the newton gravitational constant @xmath6 probably plays no fundamental role in respect to the dimension of an object , while it becomes relevant in the interaction between the objects .",
    "so it is obvious that we have not found @xmath6 in the constitutive relations .",
    "another relevant point is the connection of the presented law with the golden mean . from the art to the science",
    "the role of the golden mean is well known @xcite . here our expression agree with the golden mean and with the gross law of fibonacci and lucas @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we find the astrophysical scenario in sec.2 ; sec.3 presents a short review of definitions and properties for classic and stochastic self - similar random processes ; sec.4 is devoted to studying the exact determination of the power law at all significant scales and not only at astrophysical scales ; in sec.5 we briefly analyze some fundamental consequences from physical and geometric points of view and finally conclusions are drawn in sec.6 .",
    "as it is known luminous matter appears segregated at different scale ; in particular , we can distinguish among globular clusters , galaxies , clusters and superclusters of galaxies through their spatial dimensions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "table 1 recalls the dimensions and masses of previous systems @xcite , @xcite .",
    "@xmath16.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this paragraph , we consider systems where gravity is the only interaction among the constituents .",
    "for this reason , stars or objects smaller or larger than stars , where electromagnetic or nuclear interaction could be relevant , are not taken into account . moreover , in the work only luminous matter is considered ( dark matter will be considered in a future paper ) . under these hypotheses , we can see stars as granular constituents of dust globular clusters or galaxies and so on .",
    "moreover , a typical interaction length can be defined as a quantity which is proportional to the size of the system which contains the constituents . in other words , for each system we consider a maximum length , corresponding to its size , that plays the same role as the interaction length .    in 1965",
    "sakharov argued that quantum primordial fluctuations had to be related to cosmological evolution and to the dynamics of astrophysical systems @xcite .",
    "eddington and later on weinberg wrote the relevant relationship between quantum quantities and the cosmological ones : @xmath17 where @xmath9 is the plank constant , @xmath6 is the gravitational constant , @xmath7 is the mass of nucleon , and @xmath8 is the radius of universe .    by following the eddington - weinberg ( e - w ) approach , we can write a general relationship between the radius r of the self - gravitating system and its number of nucleons .",
    "while the e - w relationship was written only for the radius of universe , we present a relationship which is scale invariant , so it can be adopted for all types of self - gravitating systems ( and also for the entire universe ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that if we write : @xmath18 with @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21(this is approximately the number of nucleons in a galaxy ) , we reproduce exactly @xmath22 . in general",
    ", we can evaluate the number of nucleons in a self - gravitating system as @xmath23 where @xmath13 is the number of nucleons of mass @xmath24 into self - gravitating system of total mass @xmath11 ; therefore we can neglect the mass of electrons . ] .",
    "then , we obtain the relevant results recalled in table 2 . in the second column",
    "the number of evaluated nucleons is shown , while we find the expected radius of self - gravitating system in the last column .",
    "@xmath25 by comparing the last column in table 2 with the second column of table 1 , we see a full agreement between the observed and theoretical values of the radius .",
    "it is obvious that if we have only one constituent ( e.g. @xmath15 ) , like a proton or electron , the relation ( 2 ) is the standard and well  known compton wavelength .",
    "moreover , we have introduced the quantity @xmath26 which is a type of compton wavelength : @xmath27 it is interesting to note that at astrophysical scale we find a particular length .",
    "this allows us to obtain the exact radius of self - gravitation just by multiplying with the power of the number of nucleons which are present in the systems .",
    "we can make the following hypothesis : the observed universe appears self - similar to its quantum constituents . an invariant scale relation , from the quantum lengths to the astrophysical ones , plays a fundamental role . as macroscopic system ,",
    "our universe shows a sort of quantum and relativistic memory of its primordial phase .",
    "the choice to start with @xmath28 is suggested by statistical mechanics .",
    "eq.(2 ) is strictly equivalent to @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "relation ( 2 ) is the well  known random walk equation or brownian motion relation and it was firstly used by eddington @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .    in what follows",
    "we can observe that @xmath28 is a too rough estimation if other interactions , in addition to gravity , are relevant . for this reason , we will consider stochastic self - similar processes at atomic scale .",
    "these processes generalize the classic ones .",
    "it is shown below that the nucleus scale is governed by a law like ( 2 ) but with a more complicated @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 be real space and @xmath33 , then we define a self - similar ( ss ) random process for every @xmath34 @xmath35 where  @xmath36  denotes equality as distributions @xcite .",
    "the relation ( 5 ) is invariant under the group of positive affine transformations , @xmath37 since  @xmath38  satisfies the properties @xmath39 then it must have the form @xmath40 thanks to ( 8) the relation ( 5 ) becomes @xmath41 when a process satisfies ( 5 ) or ( 9 ) , it is said to be self - similar or @xmath42self - similar .",
    "a generalization of self - similar random process is obtained by replacing the deterministic scaling factor @xmath43 in ( 5 ) or ( 9 ) with a random variable @xmath44 .",
    "this variable is independent of the process to which such a variable is multiplied . then eq.(9 )",
    "becomes @xmath45 d.veneziano demonstrated in @xcite that @xmath46 can also be written as @xmath47 with @xmath48 real random variable .",
    "then , these kinds of processes , called stochastic self - similar ( sss ) random processes and the previous ones ( ss ) , can be treated in the same theory .",
    "gupta and waymire showed that for @xmath49 the sss processes are dilations , while for @xmath50 the sss processes are contractions @xcite,@xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the author proved the following relevant theorem : if @xmath51 for some @xmath52 then @xmath53 must be a deterministic constant @xmath54 then , one can treat ss and sss random processes in a unique scheme .",
    "moreover , the author gives many relevant properties and generalizations to a @xmath55-dimensional space in the same paper , but we are not going to consider these properties because they do not fit the objectives of our paper ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "presently it appears clear there is an agreement between ( 5 ) , ( 9 ) and ( 2 ) , ( 2 ) .",
    "in fact , by defining the deterministic scaling parameter @xmath56 , we find @xmath57 then our studies will explore a @xmath58-self - similar random aggregation process .    by considering electromagnetic and nuclear interactions ,",
    "relation ( 9 ) becomes    @xmath59    with @xmath60  a random variable . in principle , we have to expect a change from a deterministic scaling parameter @xmath61  to a random one @xmath62 , due to quantum treatment of nuclear and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "in this section , we invert the present point of view .",
    "we consider the mass and the radius of objects as known quantities and evaluate the power law respect to the observed data .",
    "we discover the validity of power law at all scales and not only at astrophysical scales . in other words ,",
    "we obtain the impressive result that ( 2 ) is also correct at solar system , planet , human , organic cell and nucleon scales .",
    "naturally , we have to expect a small difference in our model in respect to ( 2 ) due to the role of other physical interactions .",
    "let us consider the relation @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the quantity to be determined .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath65 where @xmath66 . for the following evaluation",
    ", we are considering @xmath67 which are the well  known values reported in @xcite .",
    "table 3 summarizes the results in respect to the objects in the length range @xmath68 and with a mass in the range @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , by following the data in table 1 , we obtain : @xmath70 from table 3 , we note that , in the first approximation , @xmath71 this is also in a full agreement with the fibonacci numbers and the golden mean trough the relation @xmath72 with @xmath73@xmath74 .",
    "if we make the hypothesis that relation ( 13 ) is a universal law , then it has to be real at all scales . due to other interactions ( e.g electromagnetic and nuclear ) the coefficient @xmath75 and not exactly @xmath76 .",
    "table 4 summarizes the results in respect to solar system objects , while table 5 is linked to organic matter and finally table 6 is in respect to the nucleus of the periodic table of elements .",
    "@xmath77 by considering table 4 we note the impressive constancy of @xmath78 for the planets of the solar system .",
    "the discrepancy of @xmath79 , in respect to the expected value @xmath80 , could be an effect of the planets not being a self  gravitating system .",
    "for the sun this discrepancy is a little bit worse than planets , probably due to not being a self  gravitating system and because of the effects of nuclear interactions in the interior of the sun .",
    "the moon , on the other hand , does not show a discrepancy worse than planets . as we know",
    ", the moon is a second order system , not self  gravitating ( e.g. there is a rotation around the earth and another one around the sun ) , but we found this is not relevant in the present study . in a recent paper , lynden - bell and dwyer have derived from first physical principles a universal mass - radius relation for planets , white dwarfs and neutron stars @xcite . in the roughest approximation , the proposed mass - radius relation for planets reduces to @xmath81 where @xmath82__h-.2em.2em__@xmath83 which is equivalent to ( 2 ) when @xmath84 then , at this scale , a stochastic process is more appropriate than a self - similar one ( as we will see in ( 16 ) ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is not to obtain an accurate evaluation of the parameter of the solar system , but just to give a compatibility of our model with the solar system .",
    "a similar approach was recently presented in @xcite ; also in this work the results reflect the cantorian - fractal structure of the space - time .",
    "a detailed and interesting study on the quantization of the solar system was made by l.nottale , g.schumacher and j.gay @xcite .    at this point",
    "it is natural to test the validity of the hypothesis at organic scale .",
    "table 5 summarizes the analysis on prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell and human organic matter . in respect to human scale",
    ", we have to take into account that a normal man is taller than he is wide ; then we have to calculate an equivalent radius @xmath8 .",
    "this radius is evaluated by considering the volume of a man as an equivalent volume on a sphere . in order to obtain the previous result",
    "we make the following considerations .",
    "let us define @xmath85{3/4(r^{\\prime } ) ^{2}h } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the value @xmath8 is obtained thanks to the condition @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 to evaluate the last row of the table 5 we have considered the following parameters : @xmath88{3/4(r^{\\prime } ) ^{2}h}=0.3039\\ m \\end{array}\\ ] ] probably not everyone will agree with our previous choice . however , if we consider the case @xmath89 or @xmath90 , the @xmath64values result in @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "in other words , our relation can give us the expected quantities also in organic matter .",
    "we can apply relation ( 2 ) in different ways to obtain relevant information about a fixed structure .",
    "for example , if we know the mass of an object we should be able to evaluate its radius , or when the radius is known we could evaluate its mass .",
    "it could be a good approach to get the dark matter in a structure by just considering fundamental quantities such as the plank constant or the speed of light .    to conclude the analysis we have tested the hypothesis on the periodic table of the elements .",
    "the universe , at all scale , is made with elements of the periodic table , then we have to determine the value of @xmath64 for all 103 elements .",
    "it is important to take into account the main part of the mass is in the nucleus ; so , we have to consider this scale for estimating @xmath8 . from nuclear physics we know @xcite that @xmath93 where @xmath94 m and @xmath95 is atomic mass",
    ". table 6 summarizes the obtained results .",
    "we checked to see if the freedom of the choice of @xmath96 in the range @xmath97 is relevant and we found it is not ; so we give only one value for @xmath8 in the table . as a comment on table 6",
    ", we can see that the value of the power law of _ he _ is the same value obtained for the planets of the solar system and the sun .",
    "this is obvious !",
    "after the nucleosynthesis the ratio [ n]/[p ] is frozen ( e.g. for @xmath98 min neutrons and protons link to produce deuterium nuclei , which create @xmath99 thanks to their fusion)@xcite",
    ". the fraction of primordial @xmath100 in the aggregated matter must be the same .",
    "for these reasons the expectation of a value of @xmath64 for the planets and the sun near @xmath100 is natural .",
    "it is interesting to observe that @xmath101 m. relation ( 15 ) has a simple explanation : in a given nucleus , heisenberg s relation of uncertainty implies that a nucleon occupies a volume @xmath102 where @xmath103 is of the order of compton length of a nucleon .",
    "consequently , the nucleus size must grow like @xmath104 by using an sss process we obtain @xmath105 where @xmath106  is the random function of the sss process with a formal expression @xmath107 . in other words ,",
    "when other interactions act on a system and they are comparable or more relevant than the gravitational one , the aggregation process makes a transition from the ordinary self  similar process to the stochastic self - similar process .",
    "relation ( 16 ) is also in closer agreement with ( 2 ) and ( 15 ) .",
    "a relevant point is the discrepancy of @xmath108 among the elements in the periodic table with a value of @xmath109 and the theoretical value @xmath80 . in principle",
    ", we can consider the discrepancy as a consequence of the approximation @xmath110 .",
    "this approximation is not relevant ; in the worst case , that is , @xmath111 , we have @xmath112 neutrons . by considering the difference @xmath113 mev / c@xmath114 ev / c@xmath115 kg . in the case of lr",
    "the correct mass becomes @xmath116 kg ; then we have a relative error @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 .",
    "there is a correction in the coefficient @xmath64 of @xmath121 which is not relevant in the present analysis .",
    "for this reason the approximation @xmath122 is not a source of the discrepancy .",
    "another possible reason could be due to the fact that we do not consider the mass of the electron .",
    "as it is known , @xmath123 , but also in this case , we find a relative error @xmath124 which is not significant .",
    "we can conclude that the only possible reason for the discrepancy is found in the presence of the other interactions ( e.g. electromagnetic and nuclear interactions ) . in other words , the statistical geometry of the system is modified by other interactions .",
    "we find the trend of the power law coefficient @xmath64 as a function of the atomic number @xmath125 in fig . 1 , while fig.3 shows the histogram for the 103 elements of the periodic table .",
    "from fig.1 it clearly appears that the ss ",
    "process is a rough approximation ; in fact the elements are not on a constant line .",
    "this fact suggests a generalized scaling parameter like @xmath106 of the stochastic self - similar processes .",
    "in the previous section we verified the validity of the ( 2 ) or ( 16 ) at all scales . then , we considered the compton wavelength expression as a particular case of a more general relation , one which is true for all material structures in the universe .",
    "we discovered a fundamental relation which demonstrates the self - similarity of the universe @xcite .",
    "we can evaluate the radius of a particular structure when the mass is known .",
    "the relations ( 2 ) and ( 16 ) show a universe that has memory of its quantum and relativistic nature at all scales . in this sense ,",
    "the plank constant and the speed of light play a fundamental role in giving a quantum and relativistic parameterization of the structures .",
    "this reveals why the astrophysical structures and organic matter have their particular lengths @xcite .    during the last twenty years much attention and strong research programs",
    "have been dedicated to the determination of dark matter .",
    "this is one of the most interesting problems of modern astrophysics .",
    "the presented scale invariant law can be used to evaluate the baryonic mass of the universe . from ( 2 ) ( with @xmath28 . )",
    "we have @xmath127 which corresponds to a number of nucleons of @xmath128 in the previous evaluation we considered a universe with @xmath129 m. therefore , in a very rough approximation we can consider a spherical universe where its density results in @xmath130 by introducing the critical density @xmath131    evaluated with @xmath132 @xmath9 km s@xmath133mpc@xmath133(where @xmath134 , we found @xmath135 which indicates a closed universe .",
    "the gravitational interaction is sufficient to reverse the expansion of the universe into a contraction .",
    "this conclusion does not agree with the present observations .",
    "moreover , the cosmological density becomes @xmath136 which does not work .    clearly",
    "the approximation of a spherical universe is too rough .",
    "the self similarity of relation ( 2 ) , and the exponent equal to 3/2 are the two fundamental ingredients of fractal geometry .",
    "the scale invariant law lives in a fractal domain .",
    "this means that nature manifests itself trough its relativistic quantum fractal geometry aspects .",
    "the presented law has memory of its quantum origin through the plank constant ; of its relativistic origin thanks to the speed of light and of its fractal nature due to the fractal power law of nucleons .",
    "therefore , the universe has fractal dimension .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite we can define the fractal dimension as following @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the number of nucleons inside the radius @xmath8 and @xmath8 is the radius of the structure .",
    "thanks to ( 21 ) , we can estimate the fractal dimensions of all astrophysical structure and of the universe too .",
    "table 7 summarizes these results .",
    "@xmath139    from table 7 it is very interesting to note a relative coincidence of the fractal dimension of the universe with the number @xmath140 .",
    "taking into account the result @xmath141 it suggests a universe whose spatial bound permeates the time dimension .",
    "if we also consider the time , then @xmath142 theoretically speaking by assuming the limitation of measurement accuracy the previous value can be the hausdorff dimension , found by el naschie @xcite    @xmath143    it is also interesting to note that @xmath144 , which is connected with the fine structure constant , i.e    @xmath145    as determined by el naschie in @xcite .    the density of the universe is : @xmath146 which is evaluated in the hypothesis of a spatial pseudo - sphere universe ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "a similar result can be reach by using a different approach based on the limit set of klenian groups @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath147 indicates an open universe , i.e. the gravitational interaction is not sufficient to reverse the expansion of the universe into a contraction .",
    "this conclusion fully agrees with the present observations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "moreover , the cosmological density results in @xmath148 we may mention at this point that el naschie in @xcite used the dimensionless gravity constant @xmath6 to establish a shanon - like entropy @xmath149 where @xmath150  is the coupling constant at the higgs - electroweak in order to establish quantum gravity .",
    "in this paper we have discovered that the compton wavelength relation is a particular case of a more general stochastic self - similar law .",
    "our model allows us to realize an actual segregated universe according to the observations .",
    "thanks to the relation @xmath151 , we have a link between the actual universe , as observed , and its primordial phase , when quantum and relativistic laws were in comparison with gravity .",
    "relation ( 2 ) appears interesting not only because it allows us to obtain the exact dimensions of self - gravitating systems , but it is scale invariant .",
    "moreover , it is extraordinary to obtain a single expression ( see ( 16 ) ) linking micro- and macro - universe in such a simple fashion .",
    "we have seen that this law is also valid for organic matter . finally , the above relation is also exact in the presence of dark matter where we have more matter and a larger radius and it can be used again to set the quantities .",
    "if we consider @xmath152 from nuclear physics ( @xmath153 ) , or the value for hydrogen @xmath154 , we can evaluate the dark matter in the universe or its related length .",
    "for these reasons it appears more general in respect to the questions posed in the present paper .",
    "there is no breaking point between microscopic and large scale universe thanks to the validity of ( 2 ) ( or better ( 16 ) ) at particles scale ( traditional compton wavelength ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observations on the large ",
    "scale structures and the random walk relation suggest @xmath155 as best value ( in agreement with el naschie s @xmath156-infinity cantorian spacetime , the golden mean and the fibonacci numbers ) , while the nuclear physics relation ( 15 ) and  our planets scale results suggest @xmath157 .",
    "consequently , we could take into account that @xmath158 can also be a random variable @xmath159 linked to the other interactions in addition to the gravitational interaction .",
    "therefore , the self - similarity model has to be generalized by a stochastic self - similar model .",
    "this confirms the fractality of power law ( 2 ) which tends to be a more general theory ( that is the theory of stochastic self - similar processes which we have just mentioned but the study of these kinds of processes is not the aim of our paper ) . in a certain sense ,",
