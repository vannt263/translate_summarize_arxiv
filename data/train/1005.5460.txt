    "quantum gravity phenomenology has developed into a broad field encompassing many possible effects arising from a more fundamental description of space - time . from cosmological perturbations to quantum decoherence to tev scale black holes to particle astrophysics to violations of space - time symmetries , many , but not all , of the effects arise from the addition of a planck scale . when the scale is at the naive planck scale the effects are only observationally accessible with huge  lever arms \" .",
    "for instance , when local lorentz symmetry is violated the lever arm of bringing the planck scale within reach of observation is the magnificent sensitivity of particle physics in the effective field theory framework to the breaking space - time symmetries @xcite .",
    "cosmological distances can act as a level arm to raise effects from the additional scale into the realm of the observable even outside the effective field theory framework @xcite . when the planck scale is shifted due to the affect of additional physics from large extra dimensions @xcite or a hidden gravitational matter sector @xcite ,",
    "the level arm is more general , pulling the effective 4-dimensional planck energy scale toward the natural scales of the standard model .",
    "this paper introduces a model in which the lever arm is intrinsic to the discrete geometry of a spatial atom . as such it is an example of a phenomenology arising not from breaking local lorentz invariance but rather from the structure of the fundamental description of space - time . the model discussed here",
    "is based on the kinematic states of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) .    in this framework ,",
    "an atom of spatial geometry is a single node of the graph which represents a quantum 3-geometry .",
    "the combinatorics of the node determine geometric quantities , including angle @xcite that is basis for the model discussed here .",
    "from dimensional analysis the behavior of the angle spectrum does not depend on the planck scale .",
    "rather , it is the combinatorics of the node that itself suggests a dimensionless  shape \" parameter .",
    "this shape serves as an expansion parameter for the corrections to classical , flat - space continuum geometry .",
    "the model is based on the interplay between this combinatorics and the angle spectrum .",
    "the highly non - uniform spectrum gives rise both to an asymmetric distribution , which is parameterized by the shape parameter , and to very large spins .",
    "while the shape involves no physical scales , the high spin determines an effective length via the quantum 3-volume .",
    "this length determines a mesoscopic scale above the planck scale where the effects might be observable .",
    "a simple analysis of bhabha scattering is used as an example of how the effects might be accessible to observation .    in the remainder of this paper",

    "thus , the closed dual surface of the node , topologically @xmath33 , is partitioned into three regions , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , such that all the regions @xmath37 are simply connected and such that the annular region @xmath38 separates @xmath39 and @xmath40 , as shown in figure [ surfaces3 ] . from this picture the angle defined above is represents the zenith or angle @xmath41 of spherical coordinate systems . as the partitions or selection of regions @xmath42",

    "although this picture is convenient and is also how the embedded version of the operator is defined , this construction is not necessary for the combinatorics .",
    "all that is required in the combinatorial setting is the partition of the incident links .",
    "one may also use a more symmetric definition of the three surfaces , as shown in figure [ surfaces3](a . ) .    as is clear from a glance at the spectrum , figure [ ang_spec ] , there are two aspects of the distribution of angles in the continuum that are hard to model .",

    "the angle operator of equation ( [ aop ] ) acts on nodes and the spectrum may be expressed in terms of the @xmath0 representations of the intertwiner core at a single node , determined by a partition of the links incident to the node .",
    "this angle operator is closely related to the combinatorial operator discussed in the works of penrose @xcite . finally , as was done originally in @xcite the angle operator",
    "may also be defined in terms of the electric flux variables and the usual embedded graphs of lqg .",
    "this is discussed in appendix a , along with some further comments on the definition of the angle operator in that framework .",
    "the notation for the remainder of the paper is as follows .",
    "twice the sum of the representations on the links incident to the node in partition @xmath44 is denoted by the  flux \" @xmath45 also denoted @xmath46 . in the dual surface picture",
    "this is the flux of spin through the respective surfaces . in the literature",
    "this is also sometimes called  area \" ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath47 uniquely specify the intertwiner core that `` collect '' the fluxes @xmath45 from each of the three partitions @xmath44 , or dual surfaces .",
    "the relevant orthonormal states are @xmath48 , denoted @xmath31.the fluxes @xmath45 and core labels @xmath49 are distinct and satisfy @xmath50 . in terms of labels @xmath49",
    "the angle becomes @xmath51",
    "the semi - classical , or continuum limit of the angle operator was numerically investigated in @xcite . to model an atom of 3-geometry we made the ansatz that the probability measure on the space of intertwiners was uniform , that every possible set of labels on internal links of the node was equally likely .",
    "we further made a simplifying assumption that all incident links to the node were spin-@xmath52 , simple and monochromatic .",
    "this assumption made the combinatorial problem quite tractable .    in the simple monochromatic case",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space of the node is the number of intertwiners at a fixed flux @xmath46 and intertwiner core @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "this equals the product of the distinct ways of labeling the three branches of the intertwiner graph . for each branch",
    "@xmath55 the dimension of the intertwiner space for fixed flux @xmath45 and core label @xmath49 is equivalent to a well - known path counting problem @xcite .",
    "the result for one branch @xmath55 is @xcite @xmath56 with the assumptions of uniform probability and simple monochromatic nodes , the combinatorics gives a probability distribution . since each branch contributes a factor as in equation ( [ collnum ] ) , @xmath57 .",
    "the probability distribution is then @xmath58 where the norm @xmath59 , i.e. is the dimension of the invariant intertwiner with fluxes @xmath46 .",
    "it was apparent in the numerical studies of @xcite that the non - uniformity in the spectrum shifted the probability distribution @xmath60 away from the usual @xmath61 distribution of angles in three dimensional flat space . to recover this it was necessary to take large fluxes , corresponding to a very high valence node , and",
    ", in particular @xmath62 , @xmath63 ; the  background geometry \" , @xmath64 , must be robust .",
    "i ll call fluxes @xmath46 that satisfy these relations  semi - classical fluxes \" .",
    "there is another reason why the we might wish to consider nodes with large spin .",
    "most physical processes we currently consider , such as scattering events , are  local \" on the scale of the theory being tested .",
    "but in terms of the quantum geometry the scales are very large , typically many orders of magnitude above the planck scale . in the volume operator",
    "likely to be relevant for the combinatorial framework , the volume scales as the @xmath65 . for a discussion on volume on lqg . ] the scaling with volume can be used to define an effective length @xmath66 and an effective energy @xmath67 .",
    "a surprising result in @xcite suggests that to model the correct distribution of angles in 3-space , the total fluxes were @xmath68 giving an effective length scale of about @xmath69 m , a perhaps not altogether hopeless scale .",
    "these initial results suggest that states with semi - classical fluxes are a promising source for phenomenology .",
    "the remainder of the paper focuses on this model of the atom of quantum 3-geometries : simple monochromatic nodes with uniform probability distribution on the intertwiners and semi - classical fluxes .",
    "( while it is expected that the simple monochromatic node will dominate the sum , relaxing this assumption will change the quantitative results reported here . ) the following analysis shows that the degree to which the semi - classical flux relations are satisfied determines the size of the combinatorial corrections investigated here .",
    "the combinatorics of the model can be solved analytically for semi - classical fluxes . for large flux @xmath70 the normalized probability distribution of @xmath71",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath72 \\simeq \\frac{n}{s } \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{n^2}{2s } \\right ) = :   p_{s}(n)\\ ] ] interestingly , the distribution @xmath73 is the rayleigh distribution for the distance @xmath11 covered in @xmath74 steps in an isotropic random walk with unit step size in _ two _ spatial dimensions .",
    "since each branch of the intertwiner is independent , the distribution for the whole intertwiner is simply the product @xmath75 the distribution @xmath76 is peaked at @xmath77 and has a width ( ` fwhm ' ) of approximately @xmath78 . for large @xmath45 the likely values of @xmath49 are also large and we can approximate the @xmath53 by continuous values . in this case",
    "@xmath79 becomes , from equation ( [ angformn ] ) , @xmath80    to study the effects of the combinatorics it is useful to work with the exact , discrete quantum states before the continuum approximation .",
    "the states of the spatial atom are labeled by the full intertwiner @xmath81 .",
    "however , accessible measurements of the atom include 3-volume , ( roughly ) determined by the total flux , and angle , determined by the states @xmath31 of the intertwiner core . in this model",
    "the fluxes @xmath46 determine a mixed state , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the projector on the orthonormal basis of the intertwiner core .",
    "the sum is over the admissible 3-tuple of integers",
    "@xmath53 such that @xmath84 . in the discrete case",
    "the projector is @xmath85 , as usual , where the orthonormal @xmath86 . at a fixed angle",
    "the amplitudes @xmath87 vanish except when @xmath53 gives @xmath88 . due to the symmetry of the angle operator ,",
    "angles enjoy a degeneracy under the exchange of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "it would be interesting to explore possible effects of the relative phases in @xmath87 , but they will play no role in the following .",
    "the probability of finding the angle eigenvalue @xmath88 in the mixed state @xmath91 is @xmath92 this procedure can be used to calculate @xmath93 in the continuum approximation .    in the continuum",
    "the mixed states for nodes with fixed semi - classical fluxes have density matrix @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the projector on the states @xmath31 .",
    "so for large fluxes and a value of the measured angle @xmath41 , now taking continuous values , within an interval @xmath96 the geometric probability distribution is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the projector onto the interval @xmath99 .",
    "geometrically it projects the state onto a ( thickened ) surface in @xmath53-space given by @xmath100 . taking the limit @xmath101 gives , heuristically",
    ", the geometric probability distribution @xmath102 this is the continuum approximation to equation ( [ discrete_dist ] ) .",
    "the normalization of the continuum approximation @xmath103 states is determined by the area of the surface @xmath104 .",
    "this gives @xmath105 and so @xmath106 becomes an overall factor in the above integration .",
    "the integration of equation ( [ rawdisttheta ] ) is straightforward and done in appendix b. the key step in the calculation is the identification of the  shape parameter \" @xmath107 , which measures the asymmetry in the distribution of angles .",
    "small for semi - classical fluxes , @xmath108 is the parameter used for the expansion of the combinatorial corrections .",
    "the result gives a modified distribution of polar angles @xmath41 given by @xmath109 .",
    "as shown in equation ( [ normn ] ) the normalization @xmath4 is determined by requirement of recovering the continuum distribution in the limit of vanishing @xmath108",
    ". the resulting distribution or measure , when expressed in terms of legendre polynomials and to @xmath110 , is @xmath111 from equation ( [ cgdist ] ) .",
    "the affect of the change is that the ` shape ' of space is altered by the combinatorics of the vertex ; the local angular geometry differs from flat euclidean 3-space .",
    "for instance , the expectation value of an angular quantity @xmath112 in the mixed state @xmath91 is corrected @xmath113 the distribution reproduces the usual distribution of angles in the limit of vanishing shape parameter .",
    "this is an analytic expression of what was found numerically in @xcite and is a manifestation of the spin geometry theorem .",
    "the @xmath114 distribution is compared to the usual one in figure [ dist_plot ] .",
    "the angular corrections are shown in figure [ q_corrections ] .",
    "the distribution of angles from combinatorial geometry @xmath115 ( red ) compared to the usual @xmath61 measure ( blue ) .",
    "the distribution contains corrections to 4th order in @xmath108 with @xmath116 . ]     the functions of @xmath114 to 4th order in @xmath108 normalized to 1 ( blue , red , green , yellow ) . ]    in the semi - classical flux limit , the values of the fluxes @xmath46 enter into the distribution only through the shape parameter .",
    "one can average over semi - classical fluxes , and thus @xmath108 , which effectively determines an average shape parameter @xmath108 .    as a result of the angle spectrum and the uniform probability measure on the intertwiner space , combinatorial effects of the toy model",
    "are parameterized by a single dimensionless shape parameter @xmath117 . while these effects would be in principle observable at any flux , the results here are valid for semi - classical flux , @xmath62 for @xmath63 . in this model the total flux",
    "@xmath118 determines the 3-volume of the spatial atom and thus an effective length scale , @xmath119 , greater than the fundamental discreteness scale of @xmath120 .",
    "so while the the shape parameter @xmath108 is free of the planck scale , the effective length scale , determined by total flux @xmath70 , is tied to the discreteness scale of the theory .",
    "if the scale @xmath66 of the spatial atom is large enough then the underlying geometry would be accessible to observations of particle scattering . to see how the combinatorial effects might be manifest i ll briefly discuss combinatoric corrections to bhabha scattering .",
    "this process is convenient because the @xmath121 scattering process involves  point - like \" fundamental particles and for the practical reason that the data is readily available @xcite .",
    "this serves as an example of possible combinatorial corrections and will not yield constraints on the model parameters . in the experiment reported on in @xcite",
    "the center - of - mass energy was 29 gev , corresponding to a rough length scale of @xmath122 m in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "this length scale corresponds to a flux of roughly @xmath123 so combinatorial corrections should be negligible .",
    "nevertheless the data serves as a simple example of how @xmath108 might be constrained using a more complete analysis .",
    "the pure qed differential cross section for the process at lowest order is @xcite @xmath124 where @xmath70 here is the square of the center of mass energy .",
    "the differential cross section at 29 gev is affected by electroweak effects .",
    "to lowest order the effect is roughly to reduce the differential cross section by 1 - 2 % @xcite . as discussed below the combinatorial corrections",
    "mimic this correction .    since this is a purely kinematic model ,",
    "i assume that the observation of the particle shower and subsequent reconstruction of the scattered angle is simply a measurement of angle .",
    "there are ( at least ) two effects of the discrete geometry .",
    "the local geometry and angular distribution on small scales and averaging over angles are modified .",
    "the former is dominant .",
    "the probability distribution of angles effectively alters the local angular geometry and leads to an angle - dependent rescaling of the cross section .",
    "the scattering data is binned in terms of the solid angle .",
    "the number of events @xmath125 counted in an interval of @xmath41 is proportional to the differential scattering cross section @xmath126 to account for the asymmetry in the combinatorics , or equivalently the modification of the local angular geometry of space , the angular normalization must be adjusted .",
    "the solid angle is modified @xmath127 .",
    "this is the first and dominant effect .",
    "the second effect arises in the averaging an angular quantity @xmath112 such as the differential cross section .",
    "the angle is only measured to some finite precision so the quantities are averaged over an interval @xmath128 , @xmath129 expanding the function gives a weighted taylor series for the average @xmath130 where the weights are given in appendix b. as the leading corrections are @xmath131 or @xmath132 , the effects are negligible for an experiment in which @xmath133 is about 0.002 rad .",
    "thus the comparison will be only from effects arising from the asymmetry in the local geometry arising from the combinatorics of the angle operator .",
    "short distance modifications to qed may be useful expressed in the drell parameterization @xcite @xmath134 these correspond to a short range potential added to the coulomb potential . in this model",
    "the combinatorics of space is fixed ; the excitations of the geometry only occur at much higher energy scales .",
    "the local , discrete geometry manifests itself through the combinatorial corrections to the local geometry .",
    "the shape corrections would be evident above the energy scale @xmath135 and give an angle - dependent scaling of the cross section @xmath136 the short distance , shape corrected cross section has a correction of the form @xmath137 it remains to be seen whether a derivation along the lines of @xcite that incorporates shape corrections would yield this form of the correction .",
    "nevertheless , this example serves to show that scattering processes could constrain the model parameters .",
    "the comparison between the model and the data is shown in figure [ bhabha ] .",
    "the data from @xcite , the pure qed prediction at lowest order , and the short - distance , shape - corrected prediction ( @xmath138 ) are plotted .",
    "the second plot contains the differential cross section normalized by the electroweak differential cross section at lowest order , as reported in @xcite .",
    "the pure qed result is shown and it clearly deviates from the data and the electroweak result .",
    "adding in the shape - correction effectively adds positive tilt to the results .",
    "the top and bottom curves show the approximate 95 % confidence limits for the qed cutoff parameters @xmath139 @xcite , with @xmath138 shape corrections .",
    "the effect is to tilt the drell parametrization curves .",
    "as reported in @xcite the scale of @xmath139 indicate point - like scattering down to a length scale of approximately @xmath140 m. the shape correction reduces power at small angles and increases power at large angles , as is clear from figure [ dist_plot ] .    [",
