    "decays of a bound state of a quark and its anti - quark , quarkonium , provide an excellent laboratory for studying qcd .",
    "particularly , heavy quarkonia such as charmonium states are less relativistic , thus play a special role in probing strong interactions .",
    "cleo recently has accumulated data taken at the @xmath5 resonance , providing a total of 27 m @xmath5 decays . with the combination of this large statistical sample and the excellent cleo detector , we will explore an unprecedented world of charmonia .",
    "while many analyses are currently being carried out , in this note we present recent results on multi - body @xmath0 decays which employed the pre - existing 3 m @xmath5 sample .",
    "we also present recent studies on decays of one of the exotic states , y(4260 ) , as well as precision measurement on @xmath2 that has an implication on properties of x(3872 ) .    finally , based on the full sample of @xmath5 data",
    ", we have results on properties of one of the light mesons , @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 states , which have one unit of orbital angular momentum and total spin of j=0 , 1 , or 2 , can not be produced directly from @xmath8 collisions .",
    "they can be reached from @xmath5 through radiative ( electric dipole ) transitions .",
    "since @xmath9 , and @xmath10 for j=0 , 1 , and 2 respectively @xcite , 27 m @xmath5 decays of the new data provides @xmath112 m decays of each spin state of @xmath0 which should give us a greater understanding of the decay mechanisms of the @xmath0 mesons .    in this section , we present recent results of studies of @xmath0",
    "decays based on 3 m @xmath5 decays which should serve as the foundation for the future precision measurements by employing the full data sample of 27 m of @xmath5 decays .",
    "we present results on @xmath0 decay into combinations of @xmath6 and @xmath12 mesons .",
    "figure  [ fig : etaetamass ] shows invariant masses of combinations of @xmath6 and @xmath12 .",
    "no @xmath13 is seen as expected from conservation of spin - parity .",
    "( a ) , @xmath14 ( b ) , and @xmath15 ( c),width=302 ]    we measured @xmath16 to be @xmath17  @xcite where the first uncertainty is statistical , the second is systematic , and the third is systematic due to the uncertainty in @xmath18 .",
    "this is slightly higher , but consistent with , the two previously published measurements .",
    "the bes collaboration measured this branching ratio to be @xmath19  @xcite and the e-835 collaboration  @xcite had @xmath20 .",
    "we also measured @xmath21 to be @xmath22 for the first time .",
    "we set upper limits for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 at @xmath27 confidence level .",
    "our result can be compared to predictions based on the model of qiang zhao  @xcite .",
    "he translates these decay rates into a qcd parameter , @xmath28 , which is the ratio of doubly- to singly - ozi suppressed decay diagrams . in his model , our results indicate that the singly - ozi suppressed diagram dominates in these decays .",
    "we have also looked at three - body decays of @xmath0 states ( one neutral and 2 charged hadrons )  @xcite .",
    "they are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . measured branching fractions",
    "are summarized in table  [ tab:3btab ] .",
    "again , our results are consistent with the results from bes collaboration  @xcite , with better precision .    in three of the above modes we looked for , @xmath29 , @xmath33 , and @xmath35 ,",
    "we observed significant signals of @xmath13 decays which are shown in figure  [ fig : threebody ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : etabr ]    further more , we also measured the mass of @xmath6 meson  @xcite .",
    "this was motivated by two recent precision measurements that were inconsistent with each other . in 2002 ,",
    "the na48 collaboration reported @xmath37  mev  @xcite , while in 2005 , gem collaboration reported @xmath38  mev  @xcite which was 8 standard deviations below na48 s result .",
    "we used the same @xmath6 sample described previously in this section but used only 4 decay modes , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 while , again , constraining masses of @xmath43 and @xmath5 .",
    "our result , the average of the 4 @xmath6 decay modes , is @xmath44  mev which has comparable precision to both na48 and gem results , but is consistent with the former and 6.5 standard deviations larger than the later .",
    "we note that the kloe collaboration also recently measured mass of the @xmath6 meson to be @xmath45  mev which was presented at the 2007 lepton - photon conference  @xcite .",
    "i have presented confirmation of babar s observation of y(4260 ) in di - pion transition to @xmath43 along with a new observation through neutral di - pion transition .",
    "our precision measurement on @xmath2 calls for more precise measurement on @xmath46 . with 3 m @xmath5 sample",
    ", we have results on two- , three- , and four - body decays of @xmath0 states in which many sub - structures were seen in three- and four - body modes .",
    "dalitz plot analyses were done for the case of 3-body decays .",
    "more detailed analyses can be done with the full 27 m @xmath5 sample . using the 27 m sample , we performed precision measurements on @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
