    "if @xmath265 , the above definition goes back to the definition ( [ double norm ] ) . obviously , the previous results are fit for the modified norm , which is just the reason why we only use @xmath266 in the previous process .",
    "we now introduce a new norm @xmath267 where @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "it should be pointed out that , by the assumption of theorem [ gevrey regularity ] that @xmath87 is analytic in the variable @xmath3 and the definition of the smooth maxwellian decay solution ( see def.[def2 ] ) , we have , for sufficiently small @xmath266 , @xmath270    as for the above norm , we can get the following integral corresponding to ( [ eq2 ] ) : @xmath271 because of the formula @xmath272 note that , when considering a sufficiently small @xmath266 , @xmath273 is well - defined .      considering the third term on the left - hand side of the above equation , with @xmath278 we have @xmath279 then the third term can be ignored .",
