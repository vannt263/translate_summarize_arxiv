    "the low - temperature physics of amorphous and disordered solids has been a subject of great interest for more than four decades .",
    "below about @xmath0k the acoustic and thermodynamic properties of a large variety of glasses are not only qualitatively different compared to their crystalline counterparts , but show a remarkable degree of universality.@xcite this universal behavior was explained by the existence of low - energy excitations with two - level structure , known as tunneling two - level systems ( tlss).@xcite in the standard tunneling model ( stm ) , each tls is characterized by the energy bias @xmath1 between its two basis states , the tunnel splitting @xmath2 between both , and its coupling @xmath3 to the strain field @xmath4 .",
    "thus the hamiltonian of each tls in the stm is@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the pauli matrices in the local states basis .",
    "the central idea of the stm is that the tlss are independent and their energy bias and tunnel splitting are randomly distributed , with a universal distribution function @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a material dependent constant.@xcite    the role of the coupling to the strain field [ third term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stm ] ) ] is threefold .",
    "first , via this channel the tls couples to phonons , which gives rise to the energy relaxation of the tls .",
    "second , by applying mechanical stress externally , one can control and manipulate the tls.@xcite third , this coupling is at least partially responsible for the coupling between the tlss . although the stm has originally considered independent tlss , it is now well established that tlss interact via elastic ( phonon - mediated ) or electric ( photon - mediated ) dipole interactions,@xcite described by the low - energy effective hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the pauli matrices that represent the tlss at sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and the interaction coefficients are @xmath15 the parameter @xmath16 in general is a complicated function of the polar angle between the tlss at sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 , but frequently can be treated as a normal - distributed random variable , @xmath17 is the distance between the tlss , and @xmath18 characterizes the specific interaction . here we will focus on elastic interactions for which @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mass density and sound velocity , respectively .",
    "our results can be straightforwardly generalized to the case where electric interactions are present .    with the advent of superconducting quantum bits ( qubits ) ,",
    "the investigation of the low - temperature properties of amorphous solids has gained further interest@xcite for two main reasons .",
    "first , ensembles of tlss are believed to be a major source of fluctuations leading to energy relaxation and decoherence in superconducting qubits and microwave resonators .",
    "specifically , the coherence times of superconducting qubits incorporating josephson junctions were found to be strongly affected by the presence of tlss located in the tunnel barriers of the junctions @xcite which are typically made of amorphous aluminum oxide with a thickness of 2 - 3 nm",
    ". a deeper understanding of the nature of tlss and their role as sources of decoherence is necessary in order to achieve high - fidelity operation of superconducting qubits .",
    "second , it was established that superconducting phase qubits can be utilized to study the properties of individual tlss.@xcite the qubit spectrum exhibits an avoided level crossing at bias values for which the qubit is in resonance with a certain tls . in addition",
    "this resonant coupling allows one to manipulate the quantum state of the tls directly by coherent single - pulse resonant driving @xcite as well as to study the longitudinal ( @xmath22 ) and transverse ( @xmath23 ) relaxation times of individual tlss.@xcite    the individual tlss that are being probed and manipulated by qubits are characterized by the level splitting of the order of that of the qubit ( @xmath24ghz ) , which is substantially higher than the temperature in the experiment . to distinguish the ( high - frequency ,",
    " probed  ) tls from , e.g. , the tlss with energy splittings smaller or of the order of the temperature ( thermal tlss ) , we introduce for the former the subscript @xmath25 and rewrite its hamiltonian ( [ eq : stm ] ) as@xcite @xmath26 the bias @xmath27 is controlled by the applied strain @xmath28 as written in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stm ] ) , i.e.   @xmath29 .",
    "recently , a static strain tuning of the energy bias of individual tlss in a superconducting phase qubit was demonstrated.@xcite the results support the assumption of the stm that the coupling of tlss to strain fields occurs mainly through a change of the asymmetry bias @xmath27 , whereas changes of @xmath30 are negligible .    in ref .",
    "the strain dependence of the relaxation and coherence times of individual high - frequency tlss was measured , revealing the following interesting features :    1 .",
    "the pure dephasing rate @xmath31 of the probed tls , as extracted from the ramsey ( free induction ) protocol , is linear with respect to the asymmetry bias @xmath32 in the vicinity of the symmetry point @xmath33 . outside the window @xmath34ghz around the symmetry",
    "point,@xcite the ramsey dephasing rate deviates from the linear behavior , exhibiting small changes of slope or irregularities . 2 .",
    "the pure dephasing rate @xmath35 , as extracted from the hahn - echo protocol , is much smaller than the ramsey dephasing rate ( with @xmath36  at @xmath37ghz ) , demonstrating the efficiency of the echo protocol in filtering noise at frequencies @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , the echo dephasing rate grows quadratically with @xmath39 in the whole measured range of @xmath39 .",
    "this implies the presence of a white - noise environment inducing energy fluctuations on a time scale @xmath40 .",
    "the starting point of the theoretical description is the following : the individual high - frequency probed tls with energy splitting @xmath41 suffers from decoherence due to its interaction with an ensemble of thermal tlss with energy splittings lower than the temperature . such thermal tlss undergo random transitions ( telegraph noise ) between their two eigenstates , thereby causing fluctuations in the energy splitting @xmath42 of the probed high - frequency tls .",
    "this is the mechanism of spectral diffusion observed in  hole - burning  experiments .",
    "@xcite as we will show in the following this picture needs to be refined in several directions .",
    "in this paper we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the coherence properties of an individual high - frequency tls coupled to an ensemble of thermal tlss .",
    "the qubit used to probe serves merely as a tool and is not part of the modeling . after providing a general theoretical description of the spectral diffusion we analyze the decoherence caused by an ensemble of thermal tlss with parameters taken from the stm ( we call these tlss `` @xmath43-tlss '' ) .",
    "a short description of this theory was provided in ref .  .",
    "we show that by assuming elastic dipole - dipole interactions as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : int1])-([eq : int3 ] ) , with a bath of thermal @xmath43-tlss , one may explain very well both the qualitative dependence on strain as well as the order of magnitude of the ramsey dephasing rate .",
    "this demonstrates that the tlss introduced in the stm form the main low - frequency noise source in superconducting phase qubits .",
    "moreover , the suggested theory predicts the temperature dependence of the ramsey dephasing rate ( at a fixed strain ) . for the echo dephasing rate , on the other hand",
    ", the theory at this level predicts that the contribution of @xmath43-tlss is orders of magnitude smaller than the experimental result .",
    "in addition , the strain dependence of the echo dephasing rate predicted by the theory is in disagreement with the experiment .",
    "we further show that the experimental results on the echo dephasing rate could be potentially explained by the presence of a few fast thermal tlss.@xcite these tlss are characterized by parameters very different from those of the stm ( @xmath43-tlss ) .",
    "in particular they have a much stronger coupling to the strain , which leads to the enhanced relaxation ( switching ) rate . from the point of view of the probed tls",
    "the fast thermal fluctuators produce gaussian noise , since their switching rate is larger than their coupling to the probed tls .",
    "this noise is white at relevant frequencies ( frequencies lower than the typical switching rate of the fast thermal tlss ) .",
    "this explains the quadratic dependence of the echo dephasing rate on the applied strain .",
    "such strongly interacting tlss ( henceforth denoted as @xmath44-tlss ) were recently introduced within a model suggesting a possible explanation for the universality of acoustic and thermodynamic properties in disordered systems at low temperatures.@xcite we estimate the order of magnitude for the contribution of the @xmath44-tlss to the echo dephasing rate and discuss its relevance in accounting for the experimental findings .",
    "we emphasize that in all our considerations we assume the probed tls to be a standard ( @xmath43-)tls , since these are the prevalent tlss at low temperatures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec 1 ] we first define the spin - fluctuator model,@xcite and then describe its results for the ramsey and echo decay signals of the probed tls in different regimes of relaxation rates and tls - tls couplings ( sec .",

    "the model is applied in sec .",
    "[ sec 2 ] to the case of an environment consisting of weakly interacting tlss as postulated in the stm .",
    "we first describe the characteristic relaxation rates and tls - tls couplings of such tlss ( sec .  [ sec 2a ] ) , and then derive the results for the ramsey ( sec .",
    "[ sec 2b ] ) and echo ( sec.[sec 2c ] ) dephasing rates . in sec .",

    "we consider a single high - frequency probed tls interacting with a set of thermal tlss via the hamiltonian ( [ eq : int1 ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : hpj ] ) describes the probed tls .",
    "the second term describes the set of thermal tlss . the coupling constants @xmath46 denote the coupling strength  ( [ eq : int2 ] ) between the thermal tls at site @xmath14 and the probed tls .",

    "the operator @xmath56 fluctuates since each thermal tls , i.e.  tls for which @xmath60 , switches randomly between its two eigenstates .",
    "such random transitions are driven by the emission or absorption of phonons,@xcite or by internal interactions between the tlss.@xcite the fluctuations in @xmath56 add a random contribution to the bare energy @xmath61 of the probed tls through the longitudinal coupling ( @xmath62 ) in the third term of eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "this results in a dephasing of the probed tls .",
    "henceforth , we will simplify the model by making the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "we consider random telegraph noise of thermally excited tlss due to relaxation ( @xmath22 ) processes .",
    "tlss with energy larger than the temperature are frozen in their ground state and are thus irrelevant for the dephasing of the probed tls .",
    "we will thus restrict the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) to thermal tlss .",
    "further , since the probed tls and the thermal tlss are non - resonant , we can neglect the transverse term ( @xmath63 ) of @xmath56 in eq .",

    "accordingly , @xmath66 is the corresponding sum  ( [ eq:4 ] ) of such random variables .",

    "therefore , these oscillations are almost completely removed by the echo protocol , as can be seen in table [ tbl ] .",
    "if several fluctuators in this regime contribute , the ramsey decay function will be a product of several incommensurate oscillating functions and , thus , will be strongly suppressed . as we will see below ,",

    "<S> we study the dephasing of an individual high - frequency tunneling two - level system ( tls ) due to its interaction with an ensemble of low - frequency thermal tlss which are described by the standard tunneling model ( stm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the dephasing by the bath of tlss explains both the dependence of the ramsey dephasing rate on an externally applied strain as well as its order of magnitude , as observed in a recent experiment [ j. lisenfeld _ et al . _ ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , the theory based on the stm predicts the hahn - echo protocol to be much more efficient , yielding too low echo dephasing rates , as compared to the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> also the strain dependence of the echo dephasing rate predicted by the stm does not agree with the measured quadratic dependence , which would fit to a high - frequency white noise environment . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that few fast tlss which are coupled much more strongly to the strain fields than the usual tlss of the stm give rise to such a white noise . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the magnitude and strong fluctuations of the echo dephasing rate observed in the experiment . </S>"
