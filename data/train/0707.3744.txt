    "search for planetary or brown dwarf ( bd ) companions to bds are of primary interest for understanding planet and bd formation .",
    "there exists no widely accepted model for the formation of bds ( e.g. recent review by luhman et al .",
    "the frequency of bds in multiple systems is a fundamental parameter in these models .",
    "however , it is poorly constrained for close separations : most of the current surveys for companions to bds are done by direct ( adaptive optics or hst ) imaging and are not sensitive to close binaries ( @xmath7au and @xmath8au for the field and clusters , respectively ) , and found preferentially close to equal mass systems ( e.g. bouy et al .",
    "2003 ; see also burgasser et al .",
    "spectroscopic monitoring for radial velocity ( rv ) variations provides a means to detect close systems .",
    "the detection of the first spectroscopic bd binary in the pleiades , ppl15 ( basri & martn 1999 ) , raised hope to find many more of these systems in the following years .",
    "however , the number of confirmed close companions to bds and very low - mass stars ( vlms , @xmath9 ) is still small . while several spectroscopic companions to bd / vlms were reported recently ( e.g. reid et al . 2002 ; guenther & wuchterl 2003 ; kenyon et al .",
    "2005 ; kurosawa , harries & littlefair 2006 ; basri & reiners 2006 ; l. prato in preparation ) , many of these companion identifications are based on only 23 rv measurements for an individual target . to date , there are three spectroscopic bd binaries confirmed , i.e. for which a spectroscopic orbital solution has been derived : the before mentioned double - lined spectroscopic binary ( sb2 ) ppl15 , the very young eclipsing sb2 system in orion 2mass  j05352184 - 0546085 ( 2m0535 - 05 , stassun , mathieu & valenti 2006 ) , and a sb2 within the quadruple gj569 ( zapatero osorio et al .",
    "2004 ; simon , bender & prato 2006 ) .",
    "all these systems have a mass ratio close to unity .",
    "in particular , no rv planet of a bd / vlms has been found yet . if bds can harbor planets at a few au distance is still unknown . among the more than 200 extrasolar planets that have been detected around stars by the rv technique , 6 orbit stellar m - dwarfs ( e.g. udry et al .",
    "2007 ) showing that planets can form also around primaries of substantially lower mass than our sun .",
    "observations hint that basic ingredients for planet formation ( disk material , grain growth ) are present also for bds ( e.g. apai et al . 2005 ) . however , the only planet detection around a bd is a very wide 55au system ( 2m1207 , chauvin et al .",
    "2005 ; cf . also caballero et al .",
    "2006 for another candidate ) , which is presumably formed very differently from the solar system and rv planets .",
    "rv surveys for planets around such faint objects , as bd / vlms are , require monitoring with high spectral dispersion at 810 m class telescopes . while being expensive in terms of telescope time , this is , nevertheless , extremely important for our understanding of planet and bd formation . within the course of an rv survey for ( planetary and bd ) companions to very young bd / vlms in chai ( joergens & guenther 2001 ; joergens 2006 ) , evidence for a very low - mass companion orbiting the bd candidate chah@xmath28 was found ( joergens 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "we report here on follow - up rv monitoring , which confirms the companion and , combined with previous rv measurements , allows to determine an rv orbit .",
    "chah@xmath28  cha  ha  8 ] has been identified as very low - mass member of the nearby chamaeleoni star - forming region ( @xmath1160pc ) by an h@xmath2 objective prism survey and low- and medium - resolution spectroscopy ( comern , rieke & neuhuser 1999 ; comern , neuhuser & kaas 2000 ; neuhuser & comern 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "membership in the chai association and , therefore , the youth of chah@xmath28 , is well established based on h@xmath2 and x - ray emission , lithium absorption , and rvs ( see references above ; joergens & guenther 2001 ; stelzer , micela & neuhuser 2004 ; joergens 2006 ) .",
    "its spectral type has been determined to be between m5.75 ( luhman 2004 , 2007 ) and m6.5 ( comern et al .",
    "comern et al .",
    "( 2000 ) estimate a mass of 0.07@xmath10 and an age of 3myr by employing evolutionary models by baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . using slightly different values for effective temperature and bolometric luminosity by luhman ( 2007 ) , a mass of 0.10@xmath10 and an age of 2.5myr are found by comparison with the same models .",
    "thus , chah@xmath28 is either a bd or a vlms . while for many of the known substellar objects in chai circumstellar disks were detected through mid - ir ( persi et al .",
    "2000 ; comern et al .",
    "2000 ) and @xmath11-band ( jayawardhana et al . 2003 ) excess emission , no indications for disk material has been found for chah@xmath28 in these works .",
    "see table[tab : hostparam ] for a list of properties of chah@xmath28 .",
    "spectroscopic observations of chah@xmath28 were carried out between 2000 and 2007 with the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) attached to the vlt 8.2 m kueyen telescope at a spectral resolution @xmath12/@xmath13 of 40000 in the red optical wavelength regime .",
    "rvs were measured from these spectra based on a cross - correlation technique employing telluric lines for the wavelength calibration .",
    "the errors of the relative rvs of chah@xmath28 range between 30 and 500 m/s .",
    "details on the data analysis can be found in joergens ( 2006 ) .",
    "rv measurements from spectra taken between 2000 and 2004 indicated already the presence of an rv companion to chah@xmath28 ( joergens 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "this paper reports on follow - up rv monitoring between march 2005 and march 2007 .",
    "the new rv measurements are presented in table[tab : rvs ] . using the combined rv data from 2000 to 2007",
    ", it was possible to derive a spectroscopic orbital solution .",
    "fig.[fig : orbit ] shows the rv measurements together with the rv curve of the best - fit kepler model .",
    "the reduced @xmath14 of the orbital fit is 0.42 .",
    "the fitted kepler orbit is that of a companion with a mass function of 4.6 @xmath15 revolving chah@xmath28 with a period of 1590d ( 4.4yr ) on an eccentric ( @xmath4=0.49 ) orbit and causing an rv semi - amplitude of 1.6@xmath160.4kms@xmath3 .",
    "the semi - major axis is of the order of 1au .",
    "see table[tab : orbitparam ] for the whole set of orbital elements .",
    "the small rv semi - amplitude of chah@xmath28 and the fact that no spectral lines of the companion were detected at any orbital phase hints already at a small companion mass .",
    "the mass of the companion @xmath17 can not be determined directly from a single - lined rv orbit but depends on the primary mass .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of chah@xmath28 , the primary mass is not very precisely determined ( as common in this mass and age regime ) . using the two available estimates for the primary mass ( 0.07 and 0.10@xmath10 , see sect.[sect : host ] ) ,",
    "the mass of the companion @xmath17 is inferred to 15.6 and 19.5@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "this does not take into account further possible errors in the primary mass , as e.g. introduced by evolutionary models .",
    "given the uncertainty of the rv semi - amplitude ( 0.4kms@xmath3 ) of the orbit solution , it can not be ruled out that the companion has a mass @xmath17 in the planetary mass regime ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the reason for this is the limited phase coverage of the available rv data , in particular at maximum rv .",
    "for example , for an rv semi - amplitude of 1.4kms@xmath3 , the companion mass @xmath17 would be 11.6@xmath0 ( @xmath19 ) .    based on the assumption of randomly oriented orbits in space ,",
    "the following statements about the mass ratio of the system can be made : with a 50% probability ( inclination @xmath20 60deg ) , the mass ratio q@xmath21m@xmath22/m@xmath23 is @xmath240.2 , and with 87% probability ( @xmath20 30deg ) , q is @xmath240.4 . comparing the mass ratio of chah@xmath28 with that of other bd / vlm spectroscopic binaries ( q@xmath250.6 , basri & martn 1999 ; stassun et al .",
    "2006 ; simon et al .",
    "2006 ) , with a probability of more than 90% , chah@xmath28 has the smallest known mass ratio ( q@xmath240.5 ) .",
    "it is noted that these probabilities are valid for both considered values of m@xmath23 .",
    "further , these are the probabilities for randomly oriented orbits .",
    "they are even higher for spectroscopic systems since this search method has a bias towards high inclinations .",
    "in the following , the question is addressed whether the detected rv variability with semi - amplitude of 1.6kms@xmath3 can be caused by chromospheric or accretion activity , which are common phenomena for very young stars and are observed also for substellar objects .",
    "chah@xmath28 shows signs for chromospheric activity through h@xmath2 ( comern et al .",
    "2000 ; luhman 2004 ; mohanty et al . 2005 ) and x - ray emission ( stelzer et al . 2004 ) .",
    "chromospheric activity can cause photometric and rv variability on the time scale of the rotation period through asymmetries in the surface brightness and spectral line shape , respectively .",
    "the rotation period of chah@xmath28 is of the order of a few days based on measurement of its spectroscopic velocity @xmath26 ( joergens & guenther 2001 , cf .",
    "table[tab : hostparam ] ) and in accordance with absolute rotation periods determined for bd / vlms in the same region ( @xmath27=25days , joergens et al .",
    "photometric and rv variability of chah@xmath28 on this time scale is of rather low amplitude : photometric monitoring in the bessel @xmath28 and gunn @xmath29 filter ( joergens et al .",
    "2003 ) over 6 nights show that peak - to - peak variability amplitudes are @xmath300.02mag and @xmath310.04mag , respectively .",
    "further , while we report here on rv variability with a period of a few years , rv variability of chah@xmath28 on time scales of days is quite small : investigation of rvs measured with time offsets of a few days in 2000 ( @xmath32=19d ) , in march 2002 ( 16d ) , april 2002 ( 3d ) and in 2007 ( 7d ) show that peak - to - peak rv differences on time scales of a few days do not exceed 0.17kms@xmath3 and can account for only about a tenth of the total recorded variability amplitude .",
    "therefore , the detected long - period rv variability can not be explained by rotational modulation due to chromospheric activity .",
    "accretion , on the other hand , can cause rv variability on various time scales .",
    "however , since no signs for significant accretion were detected for chah@xmath28 ( h@xmath2 equivalent width @xmath3310 , no caii @xmath12 8662 emission detected ; mohanty et al . 2005 ) , accretion processes are unlikely to cause the detected rv variability .",
    "we have shown that chah@xmath28 has an rv companion in a @xmath11au orbit and that this companion is most certainly a very low - mass bd .",
    "chah@xmath28 is the first small mass ratio spectroscopic binary among bd / vlms .",
    "the discovery of the rv companion of chah@xmath28 , which has an rv semi - amplitude of only 1.6kms@xmath3 , is an important step towards rv planet detections of bd / vlms .",
    "in fact , from the uncertainty in the orbit solution , it can not be completely excluded that the companion of chah@xmath28 has a mass in the planetary mass regime ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "follow - up rv measurements monitoring the next phase of periastron ( april 2011 ) are necessary to investigate this further .",
    "the favored mechanisms for stellar binary formation , fragmentation of collapsing cloud cores or of massive circumstellar disks , seem to produce preferentially equal mass components , in particular for close separations ( e.g. bate et al .",
    "thus , they have difficulties to explain the formation of the small mass ratio system chah@xmath28 .",
    "however , we know that close _ stellar _ binaries with small mass ratios do exist as well ( e.g. q=0.2 , prato et al .",
    "2002 ) , and without knowing the exact mechanism by which they form , it might be also an option for chah@xmath28 .",
    "considering the small mass of the companion of chah@xmath28 , a planet - like formation could also be possible .",
    "giant planet formation through core accretion might be hampered for low - mass primaries , like m dwarfs , by long formation time scales ( laughlin , bodenheimer & adams 2004 ; ida & lin 2005 ) , though , recent simulations hint that it can be a faster process than previously anticipated ( alibert et al .",
    "2005 ) . on the other hand , giant planets around m dwarfs might form by disk instability ( boss 2006a , 2006b ) , at least in low - mass star - forming regions , where there is no photoevaporation of the disk through nearby hot stars ( e.g. chai ) .",
    "the companion of chah@xmath28 could have been formed through disk instability , either in situ at 1au or , alternatively , at a larger separation and subsequent inwards migration .",
    "the latter is plausible in the case of chah@xmath28 since a higher mass of the formed object favors inward migration ( e.g. , boss 2005 ) .",
    "chah@xmath28 outstands the group of spectroscopic bd / vlm binaries also by its relatively long orbital period ( 1590d ) . in particular",
    ", this is the case when considering the extremely short period systems ppl15 and 2m0535 - 05 , which have periods",
    "smaller than 10 days .",
    "chah@xmath28 is part of a sample of ten bd / vlms in chai that have been monitored for rv companions since 2000 .",
    "joergens ( 2006 ; v. joergens in preparation ) finds no short period systems ( and also no equal mass binaries ) in this survey , while they are easier to detect .",
    "thus , the detection of chah@xmath28 might hint at a higher frequency of long - period ( @xmath110@xmath34d ) bd / vlm binaries in chai than short period ones ( @xmath110d ) .",
    "this is consistent with the separation distribution for currently known substellar and very low - mass stellar binaries ( burgasser et al .",
    "2007 ) which has a peak at 2.510au .",
    "we note , however , that this distribution is not well constrained for separations @xmath353au .",
    "when combined with angular distance measurements or eclipse detections , spectroscopic binaries allow valuable dynamical mass determinations .",
    "the mass is the most important input parameter for evolutionary models , which rely for masses @xmath350.3m@xmath36 , only on the two masses determined for the very young eclipsing bd binary 2m0535 - 05 ( stassun et al .",
    "2006 ; mathieu et al 2007 ) .",
    "chah@xmath28 is , after 2m0535 - 05 , the second known very young bd / vlm spectroscopic binary .",
    "however , the measurement of dynamical masses for chah@xmath28 is challenging in several respects . in order to measure absolute masses of both components",
    ", it is required to resolve the spectral lines of both components ( sb2 ) .",
    "this is preferentially done at ir wavelengths ( e.g. crires / vlt ) , were the contrast ratio between primary and secondary is smaller ( e.g. prato 2007 ) . having a maximum separation of about 13milliarcsec ( @xmath12au ) , the spatial resolution of current imaging instruments is not sufficient to directly resolve chah@xmath28 .",
    "this has probably to await owl .",
    "current and upcoming interferometers , on the other hand , do provide the necessary spatial resolution , but are not sensitive enough .",
    "however , it might be possible to detect the relative astrometric signal of the primary ( few milliarcsec ) .",
    "this would allow measurement of the inclination of the orbital plane and , therefore , breaking the @xmath37 ambiguity in the companion mass .",
    "these observations might be possible with , e.g. naco / vlt or with phase - referenced astrometry with the upcoming vlt interferometer prima ( using available brighter reference stars in the field for fringe tracking ) .",
    "we are grateful to the director general of eso for granting ddt observations of chah@xmath28 .",
    "it is also a pleasure to acknowledge the excellent work of the eso staff at paranal , who took the uves spectra of this paper in service mode .",
    "further , we would like to thank our colleagues johny setiawan , sabine reffert , and jose caballero for helpful discussions and comments .",
