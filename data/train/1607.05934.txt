    "at the end point of stellar evolution , neutron stars are not only the most compact stars in the universe , but also the strongest magnets  @xcite . in particular , magnetic fields of the order of @xmath0  g",
    "have been measured at the surface of soft gamma - ray repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars  @xcite , thus dubbed _",
    "magnetars_. on the other hand , numerical simulations have shown that the internal magnetic field could be even stronger , up to about @xmath1  g  @xcite .",
    "the outermost layer of a neutron star is thought to consist of a solid crust , whose atoms are fully ionized by the gravitational pressure ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . with increasing depth ,",
    "nuclei become progressively more neutron rich by capturing electrons until at some point , neutrons start to drip out of nuclei . the presence of a neutron liquid in the crust of a magnetar is expected to leave its imprint on various observed astrophysical phenomena like sudden spin - ups  @xcite and spin - downs  @xcite ( generally referred to as `` glitches '' and `` anti - glitches '' respectively ) , quasiperiodic oscillations detected in the giant flares from soft gamma - ray repeaters  @xcite and cooling  @xcite .",
    "we have recently studied the effects of a strong magnetic field on the neutron - drip transition in the crust of a magnetar  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the neutron - drip density and pressure increase almost linearly with the magnetic field strength in the strongly quantizing regime . in the weakly quantizing regime , the variations of the neutron - drip density with magnetic field strength exhibit typical quantum oscillations .",
    "the neutron - drip transition in a magnetar , as compared to unmagnetized neutron stars , can thus be shifted to either higher or lower densities depending on the magnetic field strength . in this paper",
    ", we explore the role of nuclear uncertainties on the neutron - drip transition considering different nuclear mass models .",
    "during the gravitational collapse of the core of massive stars ( whose mass lies in the range @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mass of the sun ) , it is generally assumed that all kinds of reactions can occur so that the hot dense matter constituting the newly born neutron star remains in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "eventually the neutron star interior becomes cold and fully `` catalyzed ''  @xcite .",
    "although the temperature inside mature neutron stars with an age @xmath4 years is typically of the order of @xmath5  k , matter is so highly degenerate that for most practical purposes the temperature can be set to zero . since the pressure inside the star must vary continuously , and since the temperature is fixed , the suitable thermodynamic potential for determining the internal composition of a neutron star is the gibbs free energy per nucleon @xmath6 ( this still remains the case even in the presence of a strong magnetic field , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the deep region of the outer crust on which we focus",
    ", atoms are fully ionized by the pressure , and electrons can be treated as an almost ideal fermi gas .",
    "the main correction arises from the electrostatic lattice energy ( for a discussion of various other corrections , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in each layer at pressure @xmath7 , the crust is assumed to be made of only one type of ions with proton number @xmath8 and mass number @xmath9 , arranged on a body - centred cubic lattice . due to the presence of a strong magnetic field @xmath10 , the electron motion perpendicular to the field is quantized into landau levels .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath11 can be conveniently measured in units of the critical magnetic field defined by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the electron mass , @xmath14 the speed of light , @xmath15 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath16 is the electron compton wavelength .",
    "typically , landau quantization effects on the composition of the crust are negligible unless @xmath17 .",
    "further details on our crust model can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in any region of the outer crust ,",
    "the pressure is provided by the degenerate electron gas so that the electron chemical potential @xmath18 increases with depth until it reaches the threshold for neutron drip  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the electron number density , @xmath21 is the proton electric charge , @xmath22 is the body - centred cubic lattice structure constant , and @xmath23 with @xmath24 the nuclear mass ( including the rest mass of @xmath8 protons , @xmath25 neutrons and @xmath8 electrons is that experimental _ atomic _ masses are generally tabulated rather than _ nuclear _ masses . ] ) , and @xmath26 the neutron mass .",
    "the equilibrium nucleus is found by minimizing the gibbs free energy per nucleon . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this nucleus is actually stable against neutron emission , but unstable against electron captures accompanied by neutron emission .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : n - drip - mue ] ) must be generally solved numerically .",
    "nevertheless , an analytical solution can be obtained in the strongly quantizing regime for which electrons lie in the lowest landau level and are ultrarelativistic ( @xmath27 ) . in such case ,",
    "the neutron - drip density and pressure are approximately given by  @xcite @xmath28\\ , , \\ ] ] @xmath29\\ , , \\ ] ]    for any given magnetic field , the composition of the outer crust and the onset of neutron drip are completely determined by nuclear masses .",
    "the nuclei expected to be found in the bottom layers of the outer crust are so neutron rich that their masses have not yet been measured .",
    "for this reason , nuclear models must be employed .",
    "we have made use of the recent series of brussels - montreal microscopic nuclear mass models  @xcite .",
    "these models are based on the self - consistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method using generalized skyrme functionals ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of the latest brussels - montreal models ) .",
    "these models were primarily fitted to the 2353 measured masses of nuclei with @xmath30 and @xmath31 from the 2012 atomic mass evaluation  @xcite , with a root - mean square deviation @xmath32  mev . at the same time , the underlying bsk functionals were constrained to reproduce various properties of infinite homogeneous nuclear matter , most of which are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "these parameters are defined by first writing the energy per nucleon of nuclear matter of density @xmath33 and charge asymmetry @xmath34 ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the neutron and proton densities respectively ) in the form @xmath37 in which the first term on the right - hand side is just the energy per nucleon of charge - symmetric nuclear matter ; we have neglected charge - symmetry breaking terms , such as those arising from the neutron - proton mass difference .",
    "we then expand @xmath38 and @xmath39 about the equilibrium density @xmath40 in powers of @xmath41 , thus @xmath42 and @xmath43 for pure neutron matter ( @xmath44 ) at density @xmath40 , the pressure is approximately given by @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , @xmath46 is a measure of the stiffness of the neutron - matter equation of state .",
    "the functionals bsk22 , bsk23 , bsk24 and bsk25 were all fitted to the same realistic neutron - matter equation of state ( as obtained from many - body calculations using realistic two- and three - nucleon forces ) , but were constrained to different symmetry energy coefficients , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50  mev , respectively .",
    "bsk26 was constrained to the same symmetry - energy coefficient @xmath51  mev as bsk24 , but was fitted to a softer neutron - matter equation of state .",
    "bsk27@xmath52 yields the softest possible neutron - matter equation of state consistent with recent quantum monte carlo calculations and with the same symmetry - energy coefficient .",
    "the model hfb-27@xmath52 is also the most accurate of this series .",
    "the range of values of @xmath53 and @xmath46 spanned by these functionals are consistent with constraints coming from the combined analysis of various experiments  @xcite ( see also the discussion in sec .",
    "iiic in ref .",
    "moreover , the incompressibility coefficient @xmath54 falls in the empirical range @xmath55  mev @xcite",
    ". finally , the high - density equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter predicted by these functionals are compatible with the constraints inferred from the analysis of heavy - ion collision experiments  @xcite .",
