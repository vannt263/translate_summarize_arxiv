    "in this paper we consider the maximum stable set problem , a well - known np - hard problem in combinatorial optimization .",

    "we investigate a hierarchy of linear programming bounds , motivated by a result of handelman @xcite for certifying positive polynomials on the hypercube . while several other linear or semidefinite programming hierarchical relaxations exist",
    ", a main motivation for focusing on the relaxations of handelman type is that they appear to be easier to analyze . indeed",
    ", explicit error bounds have been given for general polynomials in @xcite and sharper bounds that apply at any order of relaxation have been given in @xcite for square - free quadratic polynomials , as we will recall below .",
    "moreover , we focus on the maximum stable set problem , since it is fundamental in the sense that any polynomial optimization problem on the hypercube can be transformed into a maximum stable set problem using the so - called conflict graph @xcite . moreover , cornaz and jost @xcite give a direct explicit reformulation for the graph coloring problem as an instance of maximum stable set problem .",
    "algebraic approaches for the maximum stable set problem have been long studied ; see e.g. the early work of lovsz @xcite and the more recent work of de loera et al .",
    "@xcite , where hilbert s nullstellensatz plays a central role to show the non - existence of a solution to a system of polynomial equations .",
    "for instance , @xcite uses the polynomial system : @xmath3 for @xmath4 , @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , to encode the question of existence of a stable set of size @xmath8 in @xmath1 . for @xmath9",
    "this sytem is infeasible and @xcite gives an explicit nullstellensatz certificate certifying this and such certificates can be searched using gaussian elimination ( or linear programming ) .",
    "other algebraic approaches , based on finding conditions for expressing positivity of polynomials , permit to construct upper bounds for the stability number .",
    "depending on the type of positivity certificates one finds linear or semidefinite programming bounds ( cf . e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on the handelman approach , where one searches for positivity certificates obtained as conic combinations of the linear polynomials defining the hypercube .",
    "this approach for the maximum stable set problem was initiated by park and hong @xcite ( also in @xcite for the maximum cut problem ) and we will extend several of their results .",
    "we now introduce the handelman hierarchy for polynomial optimization problems and recall some known results for optimization on the standard simplex and on the hypercube .",
    "given polynomials @xmath10 $ ] in @xmath11 variables @xmath12 , we consider the following _ polynomial optimization problem _ : @xmath13 which asks to maximize @xmath14 over the basic closed semialgebraic set @xmath15 .",
    "this is an np - hard problem , since it contains e.g. the maximum stable set problem and the maximum cut problem , two well - known np - hard problems .",
    "both problems can indeed be formulated as instances of ( [ problem1 ] ) where @xmath14 is a quadratic polynomial and @xmath16^n$ ] is the hypercube .",
    "namely , given a graph @xmath17 , the maximum cardinality @xmath0 of a stable set in @xmath1 can be computed via the polynomial optimization problem : @xmath18^n } \\sum_{i\\in v}x_i-\\sum_{ij \\in e } x_ix_j,\\ ] ] and the maximum cardinality of a cut in @xmath1 can be computed via the following problem : @xmath19^n }   \\sum_{i\\in v}\\deg(i ) x_i-2\\sum_{ij\\in e } x_ix_j,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 denotes the degree of node @xmath21 in @xmath1 .",
    "see e.g. @xcite and proposition 2 below .    with @xmath22 denoting the set of real polynomials that are nonnegative on the set @xmath15 , problem ( [ problem1 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath23 a popular approach in the recent years is based on replacing the ( hard to test ) positivity condition @xmath24 by a tractable , sufficient condition for positivity .",
    "for instance , one may search for positivity certificates of the form @xmath25 , where the multipliers @xmath26 are nonnegative scalars , which leads to the so - called handelman hierarchy of linear programming relaxations for ( [ problem1 ] ) .",
    "when the @xmath27 s are linear polynomials and @xmath15 is a polytope , the asymptotic convergence to @xmath28 is guaranteed by the following result of handelman @xcite .",
    "@xcite[theohan ] assume that @xmath29 $ ] are linear polynomials and that the set @xmath30 is compact and has a non - empty interior .",
    "then for any polynomial @xmath31 $ ] strictly positive on @xmath15 , @xmath14 can be written as @xmath32 for some nonnegative scalars @xmath33 .    in the case of the hypercube @xmath34\\}$ ] , this result was shown already earlier by krivine @xcite .    alternatively",
    ", one may search for positivity certificates of the form @xmath35 ( or of the simpler form @xmath36 ) , where the multipliers @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 ) are now sums of squares of polynomials .",
    "this leads to the lasserre hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations for ( [ problem1 ] ) , whose asymptotic convergence is guaranteed for @xmath15 compact ( satisfying an additional archimedean condition ) by results of real algebraic geometry ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although the lasserre hierarchy is stronger , it is more difficult to analyze and computationally more expensive as it relies on semidefinite programming .",
    "this motivates the study of the linear programming based handelman hierarchy which is generally easier to analyze , and might yet provide some insightful information , also for the sdp based hierarchies which dominate it .",
    "some results have been proved on the convergence rate in the case when @xmath15 is the standard simplex or the hypercube @xmath2^n$ ] , which we recall below .",
    "we now present a hierarchy of linear relaxations for problem ( [ problem1 ] ) , which is motivated by the above mentioned result of handelman for certifying positivity of polynomials on a semialgebraic set @xmath15 of the form ( [ eqk ] ) .",
    "we let @xmath39 denote the set of polynomials @xmath40 . for an integer @xmath41 ,",
    "define the _",
    "handelman set of order t _ as @xmath42 and the corresponding _ handelman bound of order @xmath43 _ as @xmath44 clearly , any polynomial in @xmath45 is nonnegative on @xmath15 and one has the following chain of inclusions : @xmath46 giving the chain of inequalities : @xmath47 for @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath15 is a polytope with non - empty interior and @xmath40 are linear polynomials , the asymptotic convergence of the bounds @xmath48 to @xmath28 as the order @xmath43 increases is guaranteed by theorem [ theohan ] above .",

    "we first consider the case when @xmath49 is the standard simplex @xmath50 define the polynomial @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 denote the ideal in @xmath53 $ ] generated by the polynomial @xmath54 and , for an integer @xmath43 , let @xmath55 denote its truncation at degree @xmath43 , consisting of all polynomials of the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 $ ] has degree at most @xmath58 .",

    ", we obtain that @xmath81 $ ] , since @xmath82 has degree at most @xmath43 .",
    "therefore the results of de klerk , laurent and parrilo @xcite apply and give the following error estimates for the handelman bound of order @xmath67 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the minimum value of @xmath14 over the simplex @xmath62 .",
    "we now turn to the case when @xmath16^n$ ] is the hypercube . using bernstein approximations , de klerk and laurent @xcite",

    "this is consistent with the fact that a square - free polynomial takes the same maximum value on the hypercube @xmath2^n$ ] as on the boolean hypercube @xmath94 .",
    "using a combinatorial version of bernstein approximations , park and hong @xcite can analyze the handelman bound of any order @xmath95 , in the quadratic square - free case .",
    "they show the following result ( see section  [ secerror ] for a proof ) .",

    "assume moreover that @xmath97 for all @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "then , for any integer @xmath99 , @xmath100      the error analysis from theorem [ theoph ] applies in particular to the bounds obtained by applying the handelman hierarchy to the formulation ( [ popalpha ] ) of the maximum stable set problem and to the formulation ( [ popmaxcut ] ) of the maximum cut problem @xcite , whereas no error analysis is known for other ( potentially stronger ) linear or semidefinite programming hierarchies .",
    "this is one of the main motivations for investigating the handelman hierarchy .",
    "park and hong @xcite give some preliminary results on the _ rank _ of the handelman hierarchy , defined as the smallest order @xmath43 for which the handelman bound is exact .",
    "in particular , they show that when applied to both the maximum stable set and cut problems , the handelman hierarchy has rank 2 for bipartite graphs and rank 3 for odd cycles ( in the unweighted case ) and they ask whether these results extend to weighted graphs .",
    "we give an affirmative answer to this open question .",
    "the paper is devoted to the handelman hierarchy applied to the formulation ( [ popalpha ] ) of the maximum stable set problem . in particular , we bound the rank of the handelman hierarchy for several graph classes , including perfect graphs , odd cycles and wheels , and their complements , in the general weighted case .",
    "moreover we show that the handelman bound of order 2 is equal to the fractional stability number ( see theorem [ thmrho2 g ] ) .",
    "we also prove two different upper bounds for the handelman rank for a weighted graph , one in terms of the ( unweighted ) stability number and one in terms of the weighted stability and fractional stability numbers ( see theorem [ thmupperbound ] and corollary [ 2nd upper bound ] ) .",
    "for this we develop the following two main tools .",
    "first we show a relationship between the handelman bound of order @xmath43 and the fractional @xmath43-clique cover number , at any given order @xmath101 , by constructing explicit decompositions in the handelman set of order @xmath43 from clique covers . at the smallest order @xmath102",
    ", we show that both bounds coincide , which implies that the handelman bound of order 2 coincides with the fractional stable set number .",
    "additionally this allows us to upper bound the handelman rank of any perfect graph @xmath1 by its maximum clique size , with equality when @xmath1 is vertex - transitive ( proposition [ propperfect ] ) .",
    "second we observe a simple identity for square - free polynomials ( lemma [ lemp2 ] ) , which can be used to relate the algebraic operation of setting a variable to 0 ( resp . to 1 ) to the graph operation of deleting a node ( resp . , deleting a node and its neighbours ) .",
    "this technique permits to relate the handelman rank with structural properties of graphs and can be applied to show the upper bounds and to deal e.g. with odd cycles and odd wheels .",
    "in addition , for the maximum cut problem , we clarify how the handelman hierarchy applies to the formulation ( [ popmaxcut ] ) and show that it can be reformulated as optimization over a polytope defined by an explicit subset of valid inequalities for the cut polytope ; as an application we find again several results of @xcite ( see section  [ conclude ] ) .",
    "more specifically the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present some preliminary results about square - free polynomials and the handelman hierarchy .",
    "in particular we prove the error bound from theorem [ theoph ] ( for polynomials of arbitrary degree ) and we introduce the handelman hierarchy for the maximum stable set problem .",
    "section 3 contains our new results . in section [ sec31 ]",
    "we show a relation to fractional clique coverings and we show that the handelman bound of order 2 is equal to the fractional stability number .",
    "section [ sec32 ] contains the two new upper bounds for the handelman rank , in section [ sec33 ] we determine the handelman rank of several classes of graphs , and in section [ sec34 ] we study the behaviour of the handelman rank under some graph operations like edge deletion and clique sums . in section 4",
    "we point out links to the linear or semidefinite programming hierarchies of sherali - adams , lasserre , lovsz - schrijver , and de klerk - pasechnik . in section 5",
