    "we say that @xmath10 is _ half - arc - transitive _ provided it is vertex- and edge- but not arc - transitive . more generally , by a _ half arc - transitive _ action of a subgroup @xmath15 on @xmath10 we mean a vertex- and edge- but not arc - transitive action of @xmath16 on @xmath10 . in this case",

    "* , p.59 ) , a graph admitting a half - arc - transitive group action is necessarily of even valency .",
    "a few years later tutte s question as to the existence of half - arc - transitive graphs of a given even valency was answered by bouwer @xcite with a construction of a @xmath22-valent half - arc - transitive graph for every @xmath23 .",
    "the smallest graph in bouwer s family has 54 vertices and valency 4 .",
    "doyle  @xcite and holt  @xcite independently found one with 27 vertices , a graph that is now known to be the smallest half - arc - transitive graph  @xcite .",
    "interest in the study of this class of graphs reemerged about a decade later following a series of papers dealing mainly with classification of certain restricted classes of such graphs as well as with various methods of constructions of new families of such graphs @xcite ; but see also the survey article @xcite which covers the respective literature prior to 1998 . with some of the research emphasis shifting to questions concerning structural properties of half - arc - transitive graphs , these graphs have remained an active topic of research to this day ; see @xcite .",
    "in view of the fact that @xmath24 is the smallest admissible valency for a half - arc - transitive graph , special attention has rightly been given to the study of quartic half - arc - transitive graphs .",
    "one of the possible approaches in the investigation of their properties concerns the so called `` attachment of alternating cycles '' question .",
    "layed out in @xcite , the underlying theory is made up of the following main ingredients .",
    "for a quartic graph @xmath10 admitting a half - arc - transitive action of some subgroup @xmath16 of @xmath14 , let @xmath25 be one of the two oriented graphs associated in a natural way with the action of @xmath16 on @xmath10 .",
    "( in other words , @xmath25 is an orbital graph of @xmath16 relative to a non - self - paired orbital associated with a non - self - paired suborbit of length @xmath26 and @xmath10 is its underlying undirected graph . ) an even length cycle @xmath27 in @xmath10 is a @xmath16-_alternating cycle _ if every other vertex of @xmath27 is the tail and every other vertex of @xmath27 is the head ( in @xmath25 ) of its two incident edges .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , first , all @xmath16-alternating cycles of @xmath10 have the same length ",
    "half of this length is called the @xmath16-_radius _ of @xmath10  and second , that any two adjacent @xmath16-alternating cycles intersect in the same number of vertices , called the @xmath16-_attachment number _ of @xmath10 .",
    "the intersection of two adjacent @xmath16-alternating cycles is called a @xmath16-_attachment set_. the attachment of alternating cycles concept has been addressed in a number of papers @xcite with a particular attention given to the so called @xmath16-_tightly attached graphs _ , that is , graphs where two adjacent @xmath16-alternating cycles have every other vertex in common . in other words , their @xmath16-attachment number coincides with @xmath16-radius . in all the above definitions",
    "the symbol @xmath16 is omitted when @xmath28 .",
    "tightly attached graphs with odd radius have been completely classified in @xcite , whereas the classification of tightly attached graphs with even radius , dealt with also in @xcite , has been very recently completed in @xcite . at the other extreme ,",
    "graphs with @xmath16-attachment number equal to @xmath29 and @xmath26 , respectively , are called @xmath16-_loosely attached graphs _ and @xmath16-_antipodally attached graphs_. as shown in @xcite , there exist infinite families of quartic half - arc - transitive graphs with arbitrarily prescribed attachment numbers .",
    "however , in view of the fact that every quartic half - arc - transitive graph may be obtained as a cover of a loosely , antipodally or tightly attached graph @xcite , it is these three families of graphs that deserve special attention .",
    "now , as it turns out , all tightly attached quartic half - arc - transitive graphs are metacirculant graphs @xcite .",
    "( for the definition of a metacirculant graph see section  [ sec : examples ] . )",
    "the connection between the two classes of graphs goes so far as to suggest that even if quartic half - arc - transitive metacirculants which are not tightly attached do exist , constructing them will not be an easy task . exploring this connection is the main aim of this article .",
    "although short of a complete classification of quartic half - arc - transitive metacirculants , we obtain a description of the three essentially different possibilities for a quartic half - arc - transitive metacirculant which is not tightly attached to exist , together with constructions of infinite families of such graphs . in doing",
    "so we give a natural decomposition of quartic half - arc - transitive metacirculants into four classes depending on the structure of the quotient circulant graph relative to the semiregular automorphism @xmath0 .",
    "loosely speaking , class  i consists of those graphs whose quotient graph is a double - edged cycle , class  ii consists of graphs whose quotient is a cycle with a loop at each vertex , class  iii consists of graphs whose quotient is a circulant of even order with antipodal vertices joined by a double edge , and class  iv consists of graphs whose quotient is a quartic circulant which is a simple graph ( see figure  [ fig : classes ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : examples ] contains some terminology together with four infinite families of quartic metacirculants , playing an essential role in the rest of the paper .",
    "section  [ sec : classes ] gives the above mentioned decomposition .",
    "section  [ sec : classi ] is devoted to class  i graphs ; in particular it is shown that this class coincides with the class of tightly attached graphs ( see theorem  [ the : ta=2 ] ) .",
    "next , section  [ sec : classii ] deals with class  ii graphs .",
    "a characterization of the graphs of this class which are not tightly attached is given ( see theorem  [ the : iitheorem ] ) enabling us to construct an infinite family of such graphs ( see construction  [ cons : infinite ] ) . moreover , a list of all quartic half - arc - transitive metacirculants of class  ii , of order at most @xmath30 , that are not tightly attached is given .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] a construction of an infinite family of loosely attached ( and thus not tightly attached ) half - arc - transitive metacirculants of class  iv is given .",
