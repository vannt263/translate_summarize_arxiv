    "recent combined experimental measurements of the nuclear modification to the moderate and large transverse momentum hadron production in @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath6  @xcite reactions have provided strong evidence in support of the dominance of multiple final state interactions  @xcite over the initial state cronin scattering  @xcite and possible nuclear wavefunction effects  @xcite in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",

    "the predicted @xmath17  gev pion quenching  @xcite was found to be in good agreement with the experimental measurements  @xcite but the original sps @xmath18 data  @xcite would tend to disfavor parton energy loss in variance with the theoretical expectations  @xcite .",
    "a more recent analysis of the low energy @xmath3 baseline cross section  @xcite shows that the wa98  @xcite and ceres  @xcite data are not inconsistent with jet quenching calculations with @xmath19 when the cronin effect is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the extracted effective gluon rapidity density , however , still falls short of the expectation from the measured hadron multiplicities  @xcite .",
    "this deviation can be related to the uncertainties in the perturbative calculation in a theory with strong coupling and a non - negligible quark contribution  @xcite to the bulk soft partons at @xmath8  gev at midrapidity .",
    "therefore , the importance of studying the sensitivity of the observable spectral modification to a range of parton densities at a fixed center of mass energy should not be underestimated in theoretical calculations .",

    "the gluon radiative spectrum is evaluated numerically in an ideal 1 + 1d bjorken expanding plasma  @xcite , @xmath39 , @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 being the speed of sound .",
    "the scaling with proper time of the temperature , the debye screening mass @xmath31 and the gluon mean free path @xmath32 naturally follow . to leading power , the initial equilibration time @xmath43 cancels in the evaluation of the bremsstrahlung integrals  @xcite since @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ bj ] ) @xmath45 is the transverse size of the medium and @xmath10 is the relevant physical quantity that controls the attenuation of the final state partonic flux .    transverse , @xmath46 , expansion was not explicitly included in the energy loss calculation .",
    "hence , we first clarify its impact on the medium induced non - abelian bremsstrahlung .",
    "numerically , the contributions to the radiative spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ difdistro ] ) have to be evaluated in the background of the dynamically evolving soft parton multiplicity . in practice , for realistic 3 + 1d hydrodynamic simulation only the dominant @xmath47 term  @xcite has been considered in the mean energy loss approximation  @xcite .",
    "analytic treatments of transverse expansion must therefore provide important guidance to its effect on the radiative spectra and @xmath48 .",
    "the simplest approach to @xmath46 would be to modify the power @xmath49 of the 1 + 1d bjorken case to emulate 3 + 1d dynamics .",
    "indeed , beyond leading power , eq .",
    "( [ bj ] ) , @xmath50 effectively _ lowers _ the value of bjorken @xmath49 relative to the naive fixed coupling result .",
    "it has also been argued  @xcite that if the transport properties of the medium are related to the energy density , deviations from the ideal plasma limit would lead to @xmath51 via @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "technically , if @xmath54 the density integrals that control the energy loss can still be defined  @xcite . however , for a medium of fixed size @xmath22 where simple analytic results can be obtained , eq .",
    "( [ bj ] ) , or even for a spatially varying density profile @xmath55 , such physical picture corresponds to a superluminal bjorken expansion . in this scenario ,",
    "the dilution of the quark - gluon plasma from the transverse flow of the soft partons is modeled by streaming along the collision axis . as a result ,",
    "the partons are lost as potential scatterers for the hard jets that escape the plasma at @xmath56 and the energy loss is reduced .",
    "another consequence of choosing @xmath54 is the _ decrease _ of the accumulated transverse momentum @xmath57 with the size of the medium @xmath22 or , in realistic @xmath58 collisions , significantly lowering the dependence of @xmath59 on centrality .",
    "this contradicts the measured steady growth of the di - jet acoplanarity versus @xmath60  @xcite which even exceeds the theoretical expectations for the bjorken @xmath61 case  @xcite .    varying @xmath49 and attributing the deviation from unity , @xmath62 , to a model of spatially non - uniform medium leads to power law behavior @xmath63 rather than the smooth woods - saxon dependence of the nuclear matter density .",
    "additionally , there is a large ambiguity in the choice of @xmath49 since as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath64 of the jet propagation relative to the reaction plane the spatial density can either increase or decrease .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath65 is not a good emulation of the realistic @xmath46 expansion and that the geometry profile and the soft parton dynamics should not be substituted for each other .",
    "an analytically tractable approximation that illustrates the effects of transverse expansion has been developed in  @xcite . in this scenario , for a medium of mean density @xmath66 and mean radius @xmath67 @xmath68 the additional dilution relative to the 1 + 1d bjorken case now generated by the transverse motion of the soft partons and the increasing transverse size @xmath45 of the system . for a discussion of non - central collisions ,",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 , see  @xcite .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ 3d ] ) that the propagating jets interact with the bulk matter at midrapidity over an increased time period @xmath71 that largely compensates for the rarefaction of the medium .",
    "it has been demonstrated  @xcite that for small and moderate expansion velocities @xmath72 the 1 + 3d angular ( @xmath64 ) averaged energy loss approximates well the 1 + 1d result .",
    "logarithmic corrections arise only in the @xmath73 limit .",
    "it should now be physically intuitive why the bjorken expansion is a good approximation in the calculation of quenching in the single and double inclusive hadron spectra .    an important aspect of the application of the theory of medium induced non - abelian bremsstrahlung is the inclusion of finite kinematic bounds .",
    "these are particularly relevant at rhic and sps energies over the full accessible @xmath7 range .",
    "additional details on the evaluation of the radiative energy loss are given in  @xcite .",
    "figure  1(a ) shows the differential gluon spectrum @xmath74 and the fractional radiation intensity @xmath75 computed to 3-rd order in opacity ( @xmath76 ) from eq .",

    "( [ ftimes ] ) , and come predominantly from higher orders in opacity .",
    "these , however , do not affect the evaluation of the nuclear modification factor .",
    "the jet quenching strength is largely set by the @xmath47 term  @xcite .    in a thermalized medium",
    "the plasmon frequency @xmath77 regulates the infrared modes and the medium induced bremsstrahlung results in a few semihard gluons .",
    "numerical results for quark jets are not given since they differ by a simple @xmath78 color factor .",
    "figures  1(b ) and 1(c ) show the mean induced gluon number @xmath79 and the mean fractional energy loss @xmath80 calculated directly from eq .",
    "( [ difdistro ] ) for a range of soft parton rapidity densities @xmath81 . comparing the shape of @xmath80 in figure  1(c ) to the naive analytic expectation in the infinite kinematic limit @xmath82 and observing the deviation from the hyperbolic @xmath83 dependence it is easy to recognize the need for a careful treatment of phase space .",
    "it is also instructive to note that the average energy per gluon @xmath84 , which implies that the radiative quanta might be experimentally observable with finite @xmath7 cuts  @xcite .",
    "applications that extend beyond the mean energy loss and invoke a probabilistic treatment with multiple gluon fluctuations require additional assumptions  @xcite .",
    "so far even the case of two gluon emission with scattering has not been calculated .",
    "the poisson approximation assumes independent radiation and equivalence of the single inclusive and the single exclusive gluon spectrum .",
    "finite kinematics alone is guaranteed to violate this ansatz and so is angular ordering .",
    "nevertheless , the usefulness of such probabilistic treatment is in allowing the system to maximize the observable cross section and correspondingly minimize , to the extent to which this is possible , the effect of the non - abelian medium - induced bremsstrahlung .",
    "the probability @xmath85 for fractional energy loss @xmath86 due to multiple gluon emission is given in figure  1(d ) .",

    "the properties of @xmath85 can be summarized by the normalization of the first two @xmath92 , @xmath93 moments : @xmath94 we note the distinct difference in the manifestation of the large energy loss relative to the single inclusive spectra . in the former case the overall scale changes and in the probabilistic interpretation the distribution is shifted toward large @xmath95 values , see figure  1(d ) .",

    "we finally note that the dominant contribution to the nuclear shadowing may come from enhanced dynamical power corrections  @xcite , resulting from the multiple initial and final state interactions of the partons on a nucleus .",

    "@xmath100 is shown versus the reanalyzed  @xcite wa98  @xcite and the ceres  @xcite @xmath117 and @xmath118 data .",

    "perturbative calculations with a corresponding @xmath123 are compatible with the measured @xmath18 attenuation  @xcite , as illustrated in figure  2(a ) .",
    "quenching ratios of similar magnitude , @xmath124 , have also been predicted and measured for inclusive charged hadrons at @xmath125  gev  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that in spite of the very large initial energy density the nuclear attenuation is `` only '' a factor of @xmath126 .",
    "the reason for this somewhat unintuitive result is the strong longitudinal expansion in the absence of which energetic jets would have been completely absorbed .",

    "the cronin maximum decreases with the center of mass energy and @xmath129 .",
    "while such enhancement may naively appear large , it is consistent with the system ( @xmath1 versus @xmath6 ) and @xmath13 dependence coming from @xmath7 diffusion  @xcite .",

    "numerical estimates in figure  2(b ) from jet quenching alone indicate that the double inclusive hadron suppression is @xmath134 larger than the single inclusive quenching in the @xmath135  gev range at @xmath2  gev .",
    "the ratio was computed in the mean @xmath136 approximation , but with an explicit average over the di - jet production point for a realistic woods - saxon geometry .",

    "for @xmath141  gev the reduction of the pion multiplicity in central @xmath1 reactions relative to the binary collision scaled @xmath3 result at the intermediate rhic energy of @xmath2  gev was found to be a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "this result is consistent with @xmath142 from  @xcite .",
    "the moderate transverse momentum dependence of the quenching ratio arises from the interplay of the cronin effect , in particular its decrease toward larger transverse momenta , and the jet energy loss .",

    "this may be either a factor of @xmath149 suppression , comparable to the @xmath17  gev quenching , or binary and above binary scaling , as seen at the sps energies .",
    "both cases would indicate a marked non - linear dependence of the non - abelian energy loss on the soft parton rapidity density @xmath10 if we assume that parton - hadron duality still holds .",
    "equally striking will be an absence of strong attenuation in the away - side @xmath139 .",
