    "over the course of a jovian synodic year the distance light must transit between earth and jupiter varies by two astronomical units : approximately @xmath2  km .",
    "if we neglect the time required for light to cross earth s orbit , the interval between events that are periodic at jupiter will at earth be observed at times that may vary from the expected by as much as @xmath3  s. it was this observed variation between the observed and expected occultations of the galilean satellite io that led olaus rmer to conclude that light has a finite propagation speed and to the first real measurement of light s velocity @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "galactic compact white dwarf binary systems , or rapidly rotating non - axisymmetric neutron stars , are similarly regular clocks whose periodic signal is transmitted to earth via gravitational radiation . in the same way that rmer was able to use observations of the discrepancies in the optically measured times of io s occultations by jupiter to measure the speed of light , so we may use gravitational - wave observations by space - based lisa - like detectors @xcite of compact white dwarf binary systems , or by terrestrial ligo - like detectors @xcite of rapidly rotating neutron stars , to measure the propagation speed @xmath1 of gravitational waves .    in general relativity theory gravitational waves and light wave both",
    "propagate on spacetime null geodesics ; correspondingly , there is no difference in their respective ( vacuum ) propagation speeds .",
    "a direct measurement of the gravitational - wave propagation speed is , thus , a `` go / no - go '' test of the theory .",
    "measurement of the rmer delay directly and unambiguously access the wave propagation speed across earth s orbital baseline .",
    "this stands in contrast to other proposed tests of general relativity whose results are sometimes discussed in terms of the gravitational - wave propagation speed , but whose interpretation in this way requires a theoretical model or phenomenological framework to relate the observation to the propagation speed .",
    "for example , @xcite suggested searching for an anomalous ( compared to general relativity s prediction ) compression of the gravitational - wave signal from an inspiraling binary system .",
    "such a compression could be interpreted as a frequency - dependent gravitational - wave propagation speed resulting from a non - zero `` graviton - mass '' . in a similar vein ,",
    "@xcite proposed measuring the phase difference between the binary s orbital phase at some fiducial time as determined optically and by gravitational - wave observations .",
    "the phase difference , relative to that predicted by general relativity , could then be interpreted as differences in the gravitational - wave propagation speed at a frequency twice the binary orbital frequency .",
    "what is relevant is that , unlike the measurement described in this work , none of these other measurements directly accesses the gravitational - wave propagation speed : i.e. , their interpretation in terms of the wave propagation speed requires a theory or phenomenological framework that relates the observed phenomena to the wave propagation speed . as shown by @xcite in the context of a recent claim to have measured the propagation speed of the gravitational force @xcite through its effect on light travel , change the theory or framework and the interpretation changes .    in section [ sec : measurement ] we estimate the precision to which we can measure the gravitational - wave propagation speed from multi - year observations of periodic gravitational waves .",
    "we assume here that the gravitational - wave frequency and sky location of the source are known _ a priori_. for such cases ,",
    "we show that the fisher matrix estimate of the uncertainty can be expressed very simply in terms of the source parameters and orbital radius of the earth s motion around the sun , valid for _ all _ ground - based and proposed space - based detectors . details specific to the detectors , such as antenna pattern functions , cancel out when the uncertainty is expressed in terms of the signal - to - noise ratio of the measurement .",
    "we also discuss the complications introduced if we relax the assumption of _ a  priori _ knowledge of the source frequency and sky location of the gravitational - wave source .",
    "although the calculation is more complicated for this case , the fisher matrix formalism can still be used to estimate the uncertainty in the gravitational - wave propagation speed as a function of the source parameters and detector geometry . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we use the general result of section  [ sec : measurement ] to obtain numerical values for  @xmath4 \" fractional uncertainties in @xmath1 for observations in terrestrial and space - based detectors .",
    "we also summarize our conclusions .",
    "we use the fisher information matrix formalism @xcite to estimate the precision with which we can estimate the gravitational - wave propagation speed from multi - year observations of periodic gravitational waves whose frequency and propagation direction are known _ a priori_. for example , in the case of observations in a ground - based detector or detector network , the source may be a rapidly rotating neutron star whose rotational frequency and sky location are known from observation of its radio pulses ; or , in the case of observations made with a space - based detector , the source may be a close white dwarf binary system that has also been observed optically .    for any monocrhomatic source",

    "how well we can estimate the propagation speed of gravitational waves using observations of periodic sources whose frequency or sky location are not known _ a priori _ is the subject of work in - progress .",
    "as described here , to measure the gravitational - wave propagation speed from the rmer delay it is necessary to monitor a periodic source of gravitational waves , whose position on the sky and radiation frequency is known , for a year or more . for terrestrial detectors",
    "such a source might be a radio pulsar that also radiates gravitationally .",
    "for such sources , equation  [ eqn : result ] may be written as @xmath66 i.e. , the `` @xmath4 '' fractional uncertainty in the measurement of the gravitational - wave propagation speed arising from a one or more year observation of a 100  hz gravitational - wave source situated on the ecliptic plane is @xmath67 . since a signal - to - noise @xmath68",
    "is typically taken as the threshold for source detection in a ground - based detector or detector network , if a periodic source is observed a measurement of @xmath1 to @xmath4 precision , @xmath69 , will follow shortly .",
    "there are no reliable predictions for the gravitational - wave amplitude associated with rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "mass asymmetries  `` mountains ''  are limited in size by the tensile strength of the neutron star crust , while the potential for fluid circulation instabilities ( _ r_-modes ) to lead to gravitational - wave emission depends on the ( temperature dependent ) neutron star surface `` ocean '' shear and bulk viscosities @xcite .",
    "it may well be the case that neutron star crusts can not support a sufficiently large asymmetry to be observable gravitational - wave sources , or that the neutron star fluid viscosity is always so great as to stabilize neutron star fluid _ r_-modes .",
    "likewise , it may be that circumstances can be contrived that lead neutron stars to be strong radiation sources for ground - based detectors , but that there is no natural mechanism for creating or placing the neutron star into such states .",
    "thus , while a sensitive measurement of the gravitational - wave speed is possible with ground - based detectors , carrying it out depends on the observation of a type of source that may not be available to us .",
    "strong sources of periodic gravitational waves , in the form of galactic white dwarf binary systems , are both certain and plentiful for any of the proposed `` lisa''-like space - based gravitational wave detectors @xcite . for such sources ,",
    "equation  [ eqn : result ] is conveniently written as @xmath70 an amplitude signal - to - noise of 100 in a one - year observation is the minimum expected for a typical `` verification binary '' in a space - based detector ; correspondingly , the `` @xmath4 '' fractional uncertainty in the measurement of the gravitational - wave propagation speed arising from a one or more year observation of a 10  mhz gravitational - wave source situated on the ecliptic plane is a quite respectable @xmath71 .    at present , then , we find ourselves in an odd position . with the observation of a periodic gravitational - wave source , we know how to make a direct , accurate and unambiguous measure of the gravitational - wave propagation speed and , from it , a `` go / no - go '' test of general relativity theory .",
    "on the one hand , for existing or foreseeable future ground - based detectors there is no guarantee that there will , or  indeed  can , exist any source that will enable the measurement . on the other hand ,",
    "there are scores sources , already identified , that are accessible to a space - based detector that would enable such a measurement but , despite the strong recommendation of the united states national research council @xcite , nasa abandoned its committment to the decade - long esa / nasa partnership that would have led to the construction of such an observatory and no such project is currently planned by either agency .",
    "we can only hope that the feasibility of accurately and unambiguously testing general relativity  by means such as described here  will strengthen the case for reviving a lisa - like gravitational wave observatory in the near future .",
