    "star formation powers the evolution of galaxies . however , the processes that control the conversion of gas into stars remain poorly understood .",
    "we now know that turbulence , magnetic fields and feedback are essential for regulating star formation in the galactic disk , because gravity alone would produce stars at a @xmath10 times higher rate than observed @xcite . however , it is not so clear whether the same principles hold in the central molecular zone  a much more extreme environment .",
    "for instance , despite the high gas densities and the large amount of available gas , there is about an order of magnitude less active star formation in the cmz than expected @xcite . in order to test theories of star formation",
    ", our main aim here is to measure the amount and structure of the turbulence and to determine the magnetic field .",
    "we do this for the cmz cloud g0.253 + 0.016 , also known as the ` brick ' .    besides constraining fundamental parameters of g0.253 + 0.016 , such as the density and mass of the cloud , we focus on determining the turbulent mach number and driving , as well as the turbulent magnetic field component .",
    "we reconstruct the driving mode of the turbulence in g0.253 + 0.016 and find that it is primarily solenoidal .",
    "this is in stark contrast to spiral - arm clouds , where the turbulence seems to be significantly more compressive @xcite .",
    "the solenoidal driving of turbulence in g0.253 + 0.016 may provide a possible explanation for the unusually low efficiency of dense - core and star formation in this environment .",
    "recent observations with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) have revealed that g0.253 + 0.016 is indeed a molecular cloud with a highly complex structure governed by turbulent motions @xcite .",
    "these high - resolution dust and molecular line observations indicate that g0.253 + 0.016 is filamentary , with networks of filaments having similar complexity as in nearby spiral - arm clouds @xcite .",
    "so far the filamentary structure inside g0.253 + 0.016 has not been quantified , because pre - alma observations did not have sufficient resolution . here",
    "we measure the average filament column density and width in this cmz cloud and compare our measurements to nearby spiral - arm clouds .",
    "the observations by @xcite demonstrate that g0.253 + 0.016 is highly turbulent , but it has been unclear what drives this turbulence ( for a discussion of potential drivers of turbulence in the cmz , see  5.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulations have shown that turbulence decays quickly in about a crossing time @xcite .",
    "the fact that we see turbulence thus leads us to conclude that it must be driven by some physical stirring mechanism . in general ,",
    "potential driving mechanisms include supernova explosions and expanding radiation fronts and shells induced by high - mass stellar feedback @xcite , winds @xcite , gravitational collapse and accretion of material @xcite , and galactic spiral - arm compressions of hi clouds turning them into molecular clouds @xcite , as well as magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) and shear @xcite .",
    "jets and outflows from young stars and their accretion disks have also been suggested to drive turbulence @xcite . while different drivers may play a role in different environments ( such as in spiral - arm clouds )",
    ", @xcite found that most of these drivers are not sufficient to explain the turbulent velocity dispersions in the cmz .",
    "importantly , most of these turbulence drivers primarily compress the gas ( e.g. , supernova explosions , high - mass stellar feedback , winds , gravitational contraction , and spiral - arm shocks ) , but others can directly excite solenoidal motions ( e.g. , mri , jets / outflows , and shear ) .",
    "our goal here is to determine the fraction of solenoidal and compressive modes in the driving of the turbulence in g0.253 + 0.016 .",

    ") , there is still a substantial fraction of solenoidal modes that will be excited in the _ velocity field _ via non - linear interactions @xcite , baroclinic instability @xcite , and by viscosity across density gradients @xcite . ]    here we determine the turbulence driving parameter @xmath11 by measuring the standard deviation of the density fluctuations @xmath15 and the standard deviation of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the turbulent velocity field in g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "we find that the turbulence driving in g0.253 + 0.016 is dominated by solenoidal shearing motions ( @xmath16 ) , while spiral - arm clouds have a substantial compressive driving component , @xmath8 .",
    "our results support the idea that shear is a typical driving mode of the turbulence in the cmz and possibly in the centers of other galaxies , as proposed by @xcite and kruijssen et al .",
    ", in preparation .",
    "this solenoidal driving mode can suppress star formation @xcite and may thus provide a possible explanation for the low sfr in the cmz .",
    "interstellar filaments are considered to be fundamental building blocks of molecular clouds , playing a crucial role in star formation @xcite .",
    "indeed , star - forming cores in nearby spiral - arm clouds are often located along dense filaments @xcite and young star clusters tend to form at their intersections @xcite .",

    "thus , the term ` universal ' means in this context that @xmath20 definitely varies by less than two orders of magnitude , but more likely within factors of only a few around @xmath21 .",

    "@xcite provided a turbulence - regulated model for @xmath20 , which is based on the sonic scale of the turbulence .    here",
    "we show that over - dense regions are located along filaments also in the cmz cloud g0.253 + 0.016 , but the average filament column density is about 12 orders of magnitude higher compared to nearby clouds .",
    "surprisingly though , the average filament width is similar in g0.253 + 0.016 to solar neighborhood clouds . given the significant difference in gas temperature and magnetic fields in the cmz , it seems surprising that @xmath20 is similar in g0.253 + 0.016 to nearby clouds .",
    "we explain the universal value for @xmath20 with the _ sonic scale_the transition scale from supersonic to subsonic turbulence , following the theoretical model developed in @xcite .",

    "however , we emphasize that the local correlation with the dust emission is not sufficient to trace the kinematics of individual column density features on small scales",

    "both the filament width and the standard deviation of the density pdf are key measurements to understand the star formation activity of g0.253 + 0.016 .",

    "we see that this is a factor of @xmath9 higher than what we derived in equation  ( [ eq : sfr ] ) based on our measured @xmath197 .",
    "this demonstrates that the driving of the turbulence is a critical parameter for the sfr of g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "we emphasize that the _ turbulent _ plasma @xmath141 ( not the total plasma @xmath141 ) , enters the theoretical models for the sonic scale , turbulence driving parameter , critical density for star formation , and turbulent density dispersion , given by equations  ( [ eq : ls ] ) , ( [ eq : b ] ) , ( [ eq : scrit ] ) , and  ( [ eq : sigs ] ) , respectively .",
    "as explained in @xcite , these equations are not valid if one inserts the total ( turbulent+ordered ) plasma @xmath141 in the presence of a strong ordered magnetic field component .",
    "this is because the equations were derived by adding the turbulent pressure to the thermal pressure , thus only considering the effect of the turbulent magnetic field .",
    "this is why we derived the turbulent magnetic field component of g0.253 + 0.016 in section  [ sec : mag ] , which yields the turbulent plasma @xmath141 entering equations  ( [ eq : ls ] ) , ( [ eq : b ] ) , ( [ eq : scrit ] ) , and  ( [ eq : sigs ] ) .",
    "@xcite performed numerical simulations of star formation with the goal to understand the low star formation efficiency in g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "they primarily varied the virial parameter of their model clouds from 0.5 to 8 .",
    "we measured the total ( turbulence+shear ) virial parameter in g0.253 + 0.016 and find @xmath198 .",
    "however , @xcite find that even such high virial parameters still yield too high star formation efficiencies .",
    "a possible reason for the persistent high sfr in their simulations is that @xcite did not use solenoidal driving of the turbulence , which can reduce the sfr by factors of a few as we have shown in the previous subsection @xcite .",
    "@xcite found filaments observed in absorption of the hco@xmath199 @xmath200 line toward g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "radiative transfer calculations aimed at reproducing the observations show that the absorption filaments are located in gas of less than @xmath201 @xcite .",
    "this is low density compared to g0.253 + 0.016 , where the gas densities are @xmath202 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "[ tab : brick ] ) .",
    "thus , @xcite concluded that the absorption filaments seen in their study may be located close to the surface of g0.253 + 0.016 or in front of g0.253 + 0.016 . here instead we study filaments identified in the alma 3  mm dust continuum distribution , primarily tracing material _ inside _",
    "g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "@xcite estimated the h@xmath35 column densities of their absorption filaments to be only @xmath203 , more than two orders of magnitude lower than the column densities we find here for the dust - continuum filaments ( cf .",
    "[ fig : filprof ] ) .",
    "the column density maps shown in figure  [ fig : coldensimage ] were produced in @xcite and @xcite ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : observations ] ) .",
    "the pure _ herschel _ map was derived by modeling the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) using data from 5 _ herschel _ wavelengths obtained with hi - gal . to recover the large - scale emission in the alma interferometer data , the @xmath204 dust continuum emission from _ herschel _",
    "was scaled to what is expected at the alma 3  mm continuum emission , assuming a graybody where the flux scales as @xmath205 with a global spectral index @xmath206 and a global dust temperature @xmath207 .",
    "@xcite estimated the uncertainties following this procedure to be of the order of 10% in the column density , if the dust temperature and spectral index are fixed and only statistical uncertainties are taken into account .",
    "however , the systematic uncertainties in scaling the flux from _ herschel _ to the alma 3  mm continuum emission actually introduced uncertainties by a factor of 2 in the average column density @xmath208 .",
    "we obtained this factor 2 uncertainty by comparing @xmath208 in the _ herschel _ column density map from @xcite with the @xmath208 in the combined alma+__herschel _ _ map from @xcite , shown in figure  [ fig : coldensimage ] .",
    "since the _ herschel _ map was obtained by sed modeling with data from 5 wavelengths , it provides a well - calibrated column density map .",
    "thus , in order to derive global properties such as the average column density and mass of g0.253 + 0.016 we use the pure _ herschel _ map . for extracting filamentary structures , we use the high - resolution alma+__herschel _ _ map @xcite .",
    "the consequence of the uncertainty in @xmath208 is that the absolute calibration of the column density profiles shown in figure  [ fig : filprof ] is also uncertain by a factor of 2 , but the derived filament width is independent of @xmath208 ( because @xmath208 merely shifts the filament profiles up or down in @xmath209 , but leaves the width unchanged ) .",
    "the normalized column density pdf in @xcite and the derived @xmath210 , @xmath77 and @xmath211 in table  [ tab : brick ] are also not affected by the uncertainty in @xmath208 .",
    "this is because these quantities are defined such that @xmath208 is divided out , so they merely quantify the column- and volume - density contrast , independent of @xmath208 .",
    "@xcite investigated the correlation between the dust emission and 17 molecular line tracers observed toward g0.253 + 0.016 . for most of the molecular tracers ,",
    "they find a lack of correlation .",
    "the best overall correlation is provided by the hnco line , which is why we use it here to measure the global velocity gradient and velocity dispersion ( cf .",
    "[ fig : velocities ] ) .",
    "while the hnco line provides good coverage and is sufficiently optically thin to trace the global kinematics of g0.253 + 0.016 well , the _ local _ correlations are often rather poor .",
    "this caveat prevents us from studying the detailed velocity structure along the los toward each individual filament identified in figure  [ fig : coldensimage ] .",
    "previous studies of filamentary structures emphasize the importance of correlation between the column density and velocity structure @xcite .",
    "this must ultimately be done with more reliable line tracers than currently available .",
    "filaments in a 2d projected image of a cloud do not necessarily correspond to filaments in the 3d position - position - position ( ppp ) space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the filaments identified in figure  [ fig : coldensimage ] only correspond to filaments in projection , while they may actually consist of sub - filaments extending along the los . in order to separate contributions from multiple filaments along the los in position - position - velocity ( ppv ) space , one would need to correlate the column density structure with kinematic information from molecular line tracers .",
    "however , we currently do not have sufficiently good line tracers to test the correlation in ppv space ( see previous subsection ) .",
    "note that even if we had access to reliable information in ppv space , we would still not be able to separate filaments in ppp space . however , here we are primarily interested in the _ statistical averages over all the filaments _ , in particular their average width and column density ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : filprof ] ) .",
    "@xcite compared the filament widths obtained in 2d versus 3d and find that the mean 3d filament width is ( on average ) a factor of 2 smaller than the 2d filament width .",
    "this is because multiple filaments along the los can blend together in the 2d projection .",
    "using a relatively large fit range can therefore overestimate the intrinsic filament width .",
    "@xcite therefore recommended to use a fitting technique that is most sensitive to the peak of the filament profile and reduces the weight of contributions from the wings of the profile ( where the los blending of other filaments can broaden the profile ) .",
    "if sufficient angular resolution is available this fitting procedure can minimize the effect of the broadening .",
    "nevertheless , we caution that individual filaments identified in figure  [ fig : coldensimage ] do not necessarily correspond to coherent and individual structures in the 3d space of g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "based on the simulations in @xcite and their comparison of filament detection in 2d and 3d , we apply a factor of 2 uncertainty to our measured filament width .",
    "@xcite recently identified an elongated structure in the column density map of g0.253 + 0.016 based on _ herschel _ data . since the resolution of _ herschel _ is not sufficient to resolve the structure of filaments down to @xmath212 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coldensimage ] ) , it is possible that the elongated structure identified in @xcite actually consists of multiple sub - structures .      the theoretical models for the sonic scale ( filament widths ) and the standard deviation of density fluctuations , equations  ( [ eq : ls ] ) and  ( [ eq : b ] ) respectively , both rest on the assumption of isothermal turbulence , i.e. , gas at constant temperature .",
    "g0.253 + 0.016 has gas temperature variations ranging from as low as @xmath213 up to @xmath214 @xcite . while this is the total range of gas temperature variations across g0.253 + 0.016 , we here only need an estimate of the _ average _ global gas temperature of g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "we use an average gas temperature of @xmath215 , based on measurements from the literature ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : brick ] ) . however , we emphasize that our results are not sensitive to the exact choice of gas temperature , because the sound speed @xmath216 entering equations  ( [ eq : ls ] ) and  ( [ eq : b ] ) nearly cancels out .",
    "this is because both @xmath217 and @xmath218 depend on @xmath219 . in order to see that , consider small values of @xmath141 as applicable to g0.253 + 0.016 ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : brick ] ) and expand the factor @xmath220 in equations  ( [ eq : ls ] ) and  ( [ eq : b ] ) .",
    "we see that in the limit @xmath221 , the sound speed exactly cancels in both equations . here",
    "we have small @xmath141 instead of @xmath221 , so @xmath219 does not cancel out exactly , but almost , such that the end results for the sonic scale @xmath222 and the driving parameter @xmath11 do not sensitively depend on the choice of sound speed and thus they do not significantly depend on the gas temperature of g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "we measure and derive new physical parameters for the cmz cloud g0.253 + 0.016 , which give insight into the filament properties and the turbulence driving mode dominating the cloud and possibly galaxy - center clouds in general .",
    "our measurements and results are summarized in table  [ tab : brick ] . here",
    "we list the most important results and conclusions :    1 .   using the disperse filament detection algorithm",
    ", we find 11 high - s / n filaments in the dense gas of g0.253 + 0.016 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coldensimage ] ) . located along some of these filaments",
    "are three over - dense regions with a column density exceeding @xmath223 .",
    "as shown in previous studies , one of these cores has a water maser , which may indicate local active star formation .",
    "we find that the filling fraction of these cores is only 0.1% of the total area of g0.253 + 0.016 , indicating inefficient dense - core and star formation .",
    "we construct the average radial profile of the filaments and find a typical filament column density of @xmath224 , which is an order of magnitude higher than the average filament column density observed in nearby spiral - arm clouds .",
    "we measure an average width of @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : filprof ] ) .",
    "we find that the filament width does not significantly depend on the orientation of the filaments with respect to the ordered magnetic field component in g0.253 + 0.016 .",

    "we see a strong large - scale velocity gradient across the whole cloud , which is likely associated with strong shearing motions ( kruijssen et al .",

    "we subtract the large - scale gradient in order to obtain the distribution of turbulent velocities . from the gaussian shape of the velocity pdf ( fig .",

    "we measure the effective cloud diameter @xmath163 and combine it with the mach number and plasma @xmath141 to derive the sonic scale @xmath222 of the turbulence in g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "we find @xmath227 , in agreement with our measurement of the filament width , @xmath0 .",
    "this supports the idea that the filament width is determined by the sonic scale , equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) , both in the cmz and in spiral - arm clouds @xcite .",
    "we caution that equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) strictly only applies to the filament populations perpendicular to the ordered magnetic field ; however , we find similar widths for parallel and perpendicular filaments ( see fig .",

    "our results imply that the filament width in g0.253 + 0.016 is similar to the filament width in nearby clouds , despite the orders - of - magnitude difference in some physical parameters of nearby clouds compared to the cmz .",
    "the reason behind the similarity in @xmath20 is the sonic scale , equation  ( [ eq : ls ] ) .",

    "while the thermal and magnetic pressure are both an order of magnitude higher in g0.253 + 0.016 compared to clouds in solar neighborhood , the ratio ( plasma @xmath229 ) is similar in both environments .",
    "the same applies for the sonic mach number  both @xmath230 and @xmath219 are individually enhanced in g0.253 + 0.016 by factors of a few , but their ratio ( @xmath231 ) is again similar to nearby clouds @xcite .",
