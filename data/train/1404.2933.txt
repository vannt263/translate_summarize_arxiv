    "by virtue of its physical and chemical simplicity , the intergalactic medium ( igm ) serves as an exquisite calorimeter , recording the instantaneous ionizing emissivity and heat produced by cosmic sources at each epoch . at @xmath3 the igm is highly ionized ( gunn & peterson 1965 ) , with a fluctuating residue of neutral hydrogen : the lyman-@xmath0  forest @xcite .",
    "after nearly two decades , the lyman-@xmath0  forest remains the most well - understood and robust prediction of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g * ? ? ?",

    "this robustness arises because the lyman-@xmath0  forest is dominated by gas at moderate overdensity ; gas that traces the dark matter ( with only mild impact by pressure forces ) and whose temperature is governed by the simple processes of photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it is this simplicity that makes the calorimeter reliable : igm models suggest the neutral fraction of gas at the cosmic mean density at @xmath4 is @xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this low neutral fraction _ must _ be maintained by the background of photo - ionizing radiation produced by quasars and star - forming galaxies @xcite , possibly augmented by other undiscovered sources .",
    "determining the intensity of the ultra - violet background ( uvb )  specifically the hydrogen photoionization rate , @xmath1 , is non - trivial . because of its low surface brightness",
    ", the metagalactic uvb is not directly measured but is inferred through multiple independent channels , such as the quasar proximity effect ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or the low surface brightness emission from the outskirts of galactic disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the measurements are intrinsically difficult and subject to significant uncertainties and challenges ( e.g. anisotropic qso radiation , uncertain local gas densities ) .",
    "alternatively , one can _ predict _ the intensity and spectrum of the uvb by synthesizing measurements of all possible sources of ionizing flux and the absorption and re - emission of uv radiation by the igm and high column - density absorbers ( * ? ? ?",

    "exploiting our theoretical understanding of the igm provides a third avenue for probing @xmath1 . by forcing a match between the ( more easily observed and well understood ) opacity of the lyman-@xmath0  forest and that from a theoretical igm ( typically taken directly from simulations ) we have an independent determination that can be compared with both indirect measurements and the predicted uvb .",
    "there has historically been excellent agreement between the predicted uvb and the value inferred from the mean opacity .",
    "it was precisely the comparison between the predicted and observed forest opacity that provided strong arguments ( now confirmed ) for a `` high '' baryon density and low associated deuterium abundance @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that this excellent agreement no longer holds at low redshift .",
    "specifically , we will show a factor of @xmath10 discrepancy between the @xmath1  predicted by the most sophisticated model of uvb evolution ( haardt and madau 2012 ; hereafter hm12 ) and the value required to reproduce observed properties of the lyman-@xmath0  forest .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : background ] the predicted @xmath1  from hm12 ( black solid line ) compared to observational determinations .",

    "we will further show that our conclusions would be very similar if we instead use the mean decrement as our observational measure .",
    "after describing the cosmological simulation that we use (  2 ) and inferring the value of @xmath1  required to match the observed cdd (  3 ) , we discuss ( in  4 ) possible resolutions to the discrepancy between our inferred @xmath1  and the value predicted by hm12 , the `` photon underproduction crisis '' ( puc ) of our title .",
    "none of these resolutions alone appears entirely satisfactory .",
    "the most exciting possibility is that this discrepancy is probing exotic sources of ionizing photons or novel heating mechanisms in the diffuse igm operating far above the usual theoretical expectations .",

    "the cos cdd measurements from @xcite are shown as magenta symbols .",
    "earlier cdd measurements by @xcite ( green symbols ) are in excellent agreement at column densities above @xmath17 and are likely affected by incompleteness in the lowest column density bin .",

    "the slope of the simulated and observed cdds in figure  [ fig : cdd ] is approximately @xmath22 , so reducing the amplitude of the cdd by a factor of 3.3 requires lowering the column densities of individual systems by a factor of @xmath23 .",
    "the blue histogram in figure  [ fig : cdd ] shows the cdd computed from the simulation with the hm12 uvb increased in amplitude by a factor of five , and the agreement with the @xcite data is now very good .",
    "there is some tension in the highest column density bin , where line saturation effects are beginning to become important and details of fitting algorithms , observational noise , and spectral resolution may play a larger role .",
    "the mean flux decrement for the simulated spectra is @xmath24 , 0.024 , and 0.018 for the hm12 , hm01 , and boosted hm12 backgrounds respectively .",
    "these can be compared to the value of @xmath25 found by @xcite from observed lyman-@xmath0  forest spectra at low redshift .",
    "the mean decrement results lead to exactly the same conclusion as the cdd analysis , requiring a factor of @xmath26 boost in the amplitude of @xmath1  relative to the hm12 prediction .",
    "the cdd comparison has the virtue of focusing on systems that are the most physically simple  forest systems , there is a non - negligible contribution from high column density systems associated with galaxies that can , in principle , complicate both the observational and theoretical analysis ] ( i.e. , moderate overdensity ) and the most straightforward to measure observationally , but the similarity of the results demonstrates the robustness of the conclusion .",
    "the large mismatch between the low - redshift photoionization rate predicted by hm12 and inferred from matching the observed cdd  challenges \" our current understanding of the sources of the uvb , the physical state of the igm , or both .",
    "we now discuss a number of possible resolutions to this discrepancy .      from the point of view of the low - redshift lyman-@xmath0",
    "forest , the most important change between hm01 and hm12 is a different model for the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies , @xmath6 .",
    "to simultaneously match the high escape fractions required at @xmath27 to explain reionization and the much lower @xmath6 inferred from lyman continuum observations of galaxies at @xmath28 ( typically a few percent , e.g. , @xcite ) , hm12 adopt an evolving mean escape fraction @xmath29 . as a result ,",
    "the contribution of galaxies to @xmath1  is modest at @xmath30 and negligible at @xmath31 , while in hm01 the galaxy and quasar contributions are comparable at both redshifts . from calculations with hm12 s cuba code , we find that producing our inferred low - redshift @xmath1while keeping other aspects of the hm12 model fixed requires an escape fraction @xmath32 , as shown by the dotted curve in figure  [ fig : background ] .",
    "this simple model significantly overshoots ( factor @xmath33 ) the background at @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , resolving the puc with ionizing radiation from galaxies would require @xmath6 to evolve non - monotonically between @xmath35 and @xmath31 .",
    "most seriously , the required @xmath6 is incompatible with most direct searches for lyman continuum radiation from star - forming galaxies at @xmath36 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the low - redshift quasar emissivity in hm12 is about a factor of two below that in hm01 , a consequence of changing the adopted mean quasar sed and the adopted luminosity function ( primarily the latter ) .",
    "the quasar sed in hm12 is harder than in hm01 , bringing it into significantly better ( although not perfect ) agreement with the most recent measurements of the sed shape @xcite .",
    "recent estimates of the evolving quasar luminosity function also imply a somewhat reduced emissivity at low redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at the factor of two level the estimated contribution of quasars to",
    "the low - redshift uvb has remained stable for nearly two decades ; for example @xcite infer @xmath1@xmath37 , which is compatible with the hm12 value of @xmath38 .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that this contribution could be increased by a factor of five relative to the hm12 value , or even by the factor of two that would get back to hm01 s estimate of the quasar emissivity .",
    "corrections of this magnitude would require a dominant contribution from systems that have largely escaped the existing census of agn .",
    "in addition to being heretofore invisible , these systems would necessarily have substantially different seds from standard agn so that they could dominate the uvb without overproducing the directly observed x - ray background .      at high redshift ,",
    "the intensity of the uvb is controlled in part by the mean free path of ionizing photons , which sets the horizon over which a given source s lyman continuum radiation can influence the igm . hm01 and",
    "hm12 compute the radiative transfer of uvb photons using observational estimates of the frequency of high column density lyman-@xmath0  absorbers ( @xmath20@xmath39 ) .",
    "while these estimates remain somewhat uncertain , the mean free path becomes large at @xmath9 in any case , so that the horizon is set by cosmological redshifting rather than by absorption . as a test",
    ", we have run cuba in a case where we double the mean free path at @xmath9 , a change already inconsistent with observations @xcite , and find that @xmath1@xmath40 only increases by a factor of 1.4 .",
    "it is possible that there is a source of igm heating that is not accounted for by our simulations . in conventional models ,",
    "the temperature - density relation of the diffuse igm is determined by the balance between heating by photoionization and adiabatic cooling by the expansion of the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for temperatures",
    "@xmath41 , the hydrogen recombination coefficient scales as @xmath42 , so a hotter igm produces a thinner lyman-@xmath0  forest .",
    "the hi column density of a given system scales as @xmath42@xmath1@xmath43 , so a factor of five increase in @xmath1  achieves the same effect as a factor of @xmath44 increase in temperature .    to examine the amount of heating required to resolve this discrepancy , we have carried out the simple experiment of boosting the temperature of all sph particles in the simulation by a factor of four before extracting lyman-@xmath0  forest spectra with the hm12 uvb , and we find that the resulting cdd is similar to but slightly above that of the hm01 model shown in figure  [ fig : cdd ] , as expected by comparing @xmath45 to the factor of 3.7 difference in @xmath1  between hm01 and hm12 .",
    "a harder ionizing background spectrum leads to a hotter igm temperature because the average residual energies of photoelectrons are higher .",
    "however , producing even a factor of four increase in temperature would require an implausibly hard uvb spectral shape , so the extra heating solution would require some mechanism other than photoionization .",
    "@xcite have proposed one such mechanism , powered by tev @xmath46-ray emission from blazars .",
    "these high energy gamma rays annihilate and pair - produce through interactions with extragalactic background photons . in principle",
    ", this process can drive a plasma instability , which locally dissipates the ( high ) energy of the produced pair , thereby heating the low - density igm .",
    "this heating results in an _ inverted _ temperature - density relation in the forest because it deposits more energy per particle ( puchwein et al .",
    "2012 ) .    to investigate the potential impact of blazar heating",
    ", we have performed a suite of simulations implementing the  intermediate \" prescription for blazar heating proposed by @xcite , and confirmed that we reproduce their results for the @xmath47 relation at @xmath48 and @xmath31 .",
    "this simulation was performed at slightly lower resolution , with @xmath49 particles in a @xmath50 box , and we ran a matched simulation without blazar heating for comparison .",
    "the blazar heating has the anticipated effect of thinning out the lyman-@xmath0  forest at low redshift for both the hm12 and hm01 uvb models .",
    "the shallower cdd for the blazar simulation is because of the inverted @xmath47 relation , which reduces the neutral fraction in the lower density gas responsible for lower column density absorbers .",
    "this highlights the potential to use the low - redshift lyman-@xmath0  forest cdd to probe the impact of blazar contributions to the heating of the low - density igm . however , blazar heating is clearly insufficient to reconcile the hm12 background with the observed cdd . if we instead apply the hm01 background to the blazar simulation we get reasonably good agreement with the @xcite cdd , but most of this improvement comes from the lower @xmath51 of hm01 .",
    "it is possible that our cosmological simulations are predicting the wrong density structure of the diffuse igm owing to either cosmological or numerical inaccuracies .",
    "we think both of these are extremely unlikely . at our simulation resolution ,",
    "the properties of the forest are well - converged and largely insensitive to e.g. wind model , feedback prescriptions , spectral resolution and noise characteristics @xcite .",
    "a cosmological solution would require making the low redshift igm much _ smoother _ than lcdm simulations predict  shifting absorption systems systematically to lower columns or erasing them entirely .",
    "it is possible that cosmological models including warm dark matter or a small scale cutoff in the primordial power spectrum would go in this direction , but we are skeptical that any such change could resolve the puc while maintaining a good match to the observed lyman-@xmath0  forest . with our preferred uvb intensity , on the other hand , lcdm simulations match observed lyman-@xmath0  forest and metal - line absorption statistics over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "the most exciting interpretation of the puc is that it has revealed the presence of previously unrecognized ( and dominant ) sources of ionizing photons in the low redshift universe .",
    "a population of low luminosity or hidden agn could be such a source , though this would require a major revision to our understanding of the agn luminosity function .",
    "lyman continuum searches have mostly focused on rapidly star - forming galaxies , and it is possible that a different population , such as early - type galaxies producing uv radiation from core helium burning or post - agb stars , dominates the production of ionizing photons .",
    "more exotically , the `` missing '' photons could be coming from decaying or annihilating dark matter particles in the dense cores of halos and subhalos . producing the implied energy density of the low redshift uvb would only require the decay of @xmath52 of the dark matter density over a hubble time , so this solution would not significantly alter cosmological parameters , but it would have profound implications for dark matter properties .",
    "further studies of h@xmath0 emission from nearby galaxies are an important area for future work , as confirmation of the @xcite limit on @xmath51 would rule out _ all _ solutions involving additional ionization , including those in   4.1 - 4.3 .",
    "the factor of 5 discrepancy between the value of @xmath1  required to match cosmological models of the @xmath31 igm to the observed mean decrement and cdd and that predicted by state - of - the art models for the evolution of the extragalactic uvb ( hm12 ) highlights a significant gap in our current understanding of the sources of the uv background or the structure of the igm , or both .",
    "we have discussed a number of possible resolutions , no one of which appears satisfactory .",
    "least _ radical solution is to increase the mean @xmath6 at low - redshift such that galaxies dominate the emissivity _ and _ simultaneously boost the quasar emissivity , though both of these changes oppose our current understanding of these sources . for the undaunted , extra photons from decaying dark matter or a drastic change to the physical structure of the igm as predicted by lcdm may also be the resolution to the photon underproduction crisis .",
