    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) long - range order is robust and usually highly resistant to weak spatially random perturbations . in particular , this applies to field - induced magnetic order in gapped quantum spin systems .",
    "this type of quantum phase transition has recently attracted a great deal of attention due to its interpretation in terms of a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of magnons.@xcite in magnetic materials , disorder can be introduced by randomizing the strength of magnetic bonds . in simple models ,",
    "its primary effect is to produce a random potential for the condensing magnons .",
    "the result is a qualitatively new phase with non - zero magnetization and susceptibility , but only short range correlations , the so - called magnetic bose glass.@xcite however , unless the disorder is very strong , the ordered bec phase is expected to re - emerge at higher fields.@xcite an intriguing question is whether _ weak _ randomness in quantum magnets can go beyond creating a random magnon potential , in a way that disrupts the formation of the condensate altogether ?        in the present work we investigate the effect of bond strength disorder on",
    "the _ geometrically frustrated _ gapped quantum magnet h@xmath0c@xmath1so@xmath2cu@xmath3cl@xmath6  ( scc for short).@xcite bond disorder is introduced by a chemical substitution on the non - magnetic site in the isostructural h@xmath0c@xmath1so@xmath2cu@xmath3(cl@xmath4br@xmath5)@xmath6  ( hereafter abbreviated as scx ) .",
    "we find that extremely low br concentrations have a catastrophic effect on the phase transition and magnetic properties .",
    "this behavior is attributed to _ frustration disorder _ , enhanced by the incommensurate and quasi - one - dimensional spin correlations in the parent compound .    to our knowledge ,",
    "the parent compound scc is quite unique being a strongly quasi - one - dimensional gapped heisenberg spin system where geometric frustration is strong enough to cause dynamic spin correlations to be incommensurate . from the point of view of structural chemistry",
    ", it belongs to a large and diverse family of organic complexes involving transition metal halogenides ( see , for example , refs .  ) .",
    "antiferromagnetic ( af ) interactions between the @xmath9 cu@xmath10 ions are carried by cu - x - x - cu superexchange pathways ( x = halogen ion ) .",
    "the resulting spin network can be described as four - leg `` spin tubes '' with a high degree of geometric frustration,@xcite and weak inter - tube coupling .",
    "the ground state is a spin liquid , with a gap @xmath11  mev in the magnetic excitation spectrum .",
    "the exact spin hamiltonian is presently unknown .",
    "however , due to the strong one - dimensionality , all relevant low - energy low - temperature properties are governed by the lowest - energy triplet of magnons.@xcite .",
    "in scc , the latter have a very large spin velocity @xmath12 along the @xmath13 axis , @xmath14  mev .",
    "a key observation is that , due to the geometric frustration , the minimum of dispersion is at an _ incommensurate _ wave vector @xmath15 . in magnetic fields exceeding @xmath16  t a condensation of magnons",
    "@xcite produces an incommensurate phase with spontaneous 3d long - range helimagnetic order of spin components transverse to the applied fields and a propagation vector @xmath17.@xcite this pitch of the spin spiral corresponds to the incommensurate dynamic spin correlations in zero field .",
    "to investigate the effect of disorder on this field - induced phase transition , we focused on the chemically modified material scx , with the br concentration @xmath18 ranging 05% .",
    "the idea is that substituting cl@xmath19 by the larger - radius br@xmath19 will affect the cu - cu superexchange coupling locally.@xcite since the relevant cu - x - x - cu bond angles are far from 90@xmath20 , kanamori - goodenough rules @xcite suggest that the af nature of the interaction will be preserved , although its magnitude may be significantly affected",
    ". a random distribution of br substitution sites will thus result in a randomization of af bond strengths .",
    "a series of well - faceted single crystal samples of typical mass 100  mg were grown by temperature gradient method from ethanol solution with varying relative cl / br content . for each nominal br concentration @xmath18",
    ", the samples were characterized by x - ray diffraction using a bruker apex - ii single crystal diffractometer and by micro - elemental chemical analysis ( schniger method ) .",
    "we found all crystals to be isostructural to the parent compound .",
    "atomic positions were refined together with the actual br concentration , assuming a uniform distribution of substitution sites .",
    "the fitted br content is in good agreement with chemical data and the nominal br concentration in solution .",
    "as far as the lattice parameters are concerned , the strongest effect of br substitution is on the @xmath13 ( ladder - leg ) axis , which shows a linear increase from 10.035    to 10.050   , as @xmath18 varies from 0 to 5% .",
    "the clearest signature of the field - induced ordering transition in disorder - free scc is the lambda - anomaly in the temperature dependence of specific heat.@xcite fig .",
    "[ spec]a shows the heat capacity measured in a 3.5  mg @xmath7 sample as a function of temperature in several fields applied along the crystallographic @xmath13 axis , using a quantum design ppms with a dilution refrigerator insert .",
    "the sharp lambda anomaly is quite prominent and allows to trace the phase boundary on the @xmath21 phase diagram , as shown in solid symbols in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "the phase transition is also manifest in the field dependence of magnetic susceptibility @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ sus ] , solid symbols ) , measured for @xmath23 on a 25  mg crystal using a quantum design squid magnetometer with an iquantum @xmath24he refrigerator . , but is exponentially negligible at @xmath25 due to saturation .",
    "it was determined by fitting the magnetization data below @xmath26  t to the @xmath27 form , expected for paramagnetic spins . ]",
    "the transition appears as a sharp peak , separating the gapped phase at low fields and the ordered , susceptible high - field state . for a bec of magnons , magnetization @xmath28",
    "is mapped onto boson density , and susceptibility @xmath29 - on the compressibility of the bose gas.@xcite in these terms , the transition is that between an incompressible `` mott - insulator '' magnon phase below @xmath30 , to a compressible bose condensate of magnons at high fields . note that an elevated temperature of 800  mk , the step in the @xmath31 curve is broadened , but a sharp peak marking the phase transition persists",
    "the third manifestation of the 3d ordering transition is found in @xmath32 curves measured at fixed fields applied along the @xmath13 axis ( fig .",
    "[ sus ] , inset ) . upon cooling through the ordering temperature ,",
    "the magnetization ( boson density ) shows an almost discontinuous jump following a well - defined minimum , which is a known characteristic signature of bec.@xcite      the central result of this work is that br substitution at very low concentrations _ destroys _ the thermodynamic field - induced transition described above .",
    "already for @xmath33 the lambda anomalies in the @xmath34 curves at all fields are replaced by visibly broadened peaks ( fig .",
    "[ spec]b ) . for @xmath35",
    "the peak widths increase further ( fig .",
    "[ spec]c ) .",
    "this behavior indicates that the sharp transition for @xmath7 gives way to a crossover in disordered samples , presumably to a state with short range order .",
    "indeed , preliminary neutron diffraction experiments on deuterated samples , performed at the tasp 3-axis spectrometer at paul scherrer institut and at the d23 diffractometer at ill , failed to observe any magnetic diffraction peaks associated with helimagnetic order .",
    "a thorough search for such reflections was performed in the @xmath36 reciprocal - space plane for @xmath37 , at @xmath38  mk and @xmath39  t. while it can not be fully excluded that the peak absence is not due to disorder , but to a drastic change of the propagation vector along the chain axis , due to the large spin wave velocity this scenario appears unlikely .",
    "if the high - field phase is indeed short - range ordered , one can expect diffuse magnetic scattering in the form of anisotropically broadened peaks at bragg positions . in scx no such scattering could be found , but this result can not be considered conclusive .",
    "unfortunately , experimental limitation would have made it unobservable even if it were present . in the disorder - free material where the peaks are sharp , they are extremely weak and correspond to only @xmath40  @xmath41 ordered moment.@xcite even a small broadening due to short - range order in scx would render them invisible above the rather high intrinsic background .    returning to the specific heat data in(fig",
    ".  [ spec ] , we note that even as the peaks broaden upon br substitution , their positions are not subject to a substantial shift .",
    "the corresponding crossover temperatures at each field were identified with the maxima in @xmath34 , obtained in empirical narrow - range lorentzian fits .",
    "the thus determined crossover lines , for @xmath33 and @xmath35 , are shown in open symbols in fig .  [ phase ] .",
    "phase boundary of scc deduced from specific heat data .",
    "open symbols : field dependence of crossover temperatures in scx for @xmath8and @xmath42 .",
    "the latter are defined as positions of broad specific heat maxima in constant - field scans .",
    "lines are guides for the eye.[phase ] ]    the effect of chemically introduced randomness on the magnetic properties is no less dramatic .",
    "the field dependence of magnetic susceptibility for the disordered samples are shown in fig .",
    "[ sus ] . at all temperatures , the sharp peak seen for @xmath7 ,",
    "is replaced by a broad feature at @xmath33 , and altogether absent for @xmath35 .",
    "this behavior is accompanied by an overall broadening of the step in the @xmath31 curve with increasing @xmath18 .",
    "the jump in the temperature dependence of the magnetization is also smeared out by disorder ( inset in fig .",
    "[ sus ] ) .",
    "thus , magnetometric measurements confirm that the bec transition in the parent compound is replaced by a broad crossover in the disordered systems .",
    "the effect of bond disorder on the field - induced bec of magnons has been previously studied experimentally in a number of prototype materials , including ipa - cu(cl@xmath4br@xmath5)@xmath43,@xcite tl@xmath4k@xmath5cucl@xmath43 ( ref .  ) and most recently ni(cl@xmath4br@xmath5)@xmath24sc(nh@xmath3)@xmath3.@xcite it was found that disorder may considerably affect the phase boundary , modify the critical behavior and give rise to a compressible disordered state just below the 3d ordering transition . however , in _ all _ of these materials , the transition itself is preserved , even for a large concentration of disorder sites that significantly alters the critical field and temperature . the strength and sharpness of anomalies in thermodynamic properties remains practically unaffected by disorder .",
    "the behavior of scx is clearly different . here",
    "the condensate appears to be extraordinarily fragile with respect to randomness , resulting is qualitative contract between thermodynamic anomalies in the pure and disordered samples .",
    "it is this contrast that we emphasize as the main experimental finding , since weak or broadened anomalies _ per se _ do not necessarily signify the absence of a phase transition ( see , for example , refs .  ) .",
    "below we propose a qualitative model that attributes this behavior to a geometric frustration of magnetic interactions and the incommensurate nature of spin correlations .    ,",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath42 , at @xmath44  mk ( a ) and @xmath45  mk ( b ) .",
    "lines are guides for the eye .",
    "inset : magnetization as a function of temperature measured a a constant field @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath7 data set ( circles ) has been shifted down by @xmath47/cu for visualization purposes .",
    "the arrows indicate the positions of @xmath48 maxima for the respective br concentrations .",
    "[ sus ] ]    consider a single geometrically frustrated spin tube in scc . in a magnetic field that exceeds @xmath30 , it is a gapless luttinger spin liquid @xcite with a correlation length that diverges at @xmath49 .",
    "these increasingly long - range correlations will be incommensurate and helimagnetic",
    ". their pitch @xmath50 will be defined by the magnitude of geometric frustration of interactions in the spin tube .",
    "a random distribution of br sites in scx will result in a random distribution of the frustration ratios along the spin tube , and , in turn , a randomized phase of the spiral spin correlations . for site @xmath51",
    ", we can write @xmath52 , where @xmath53 are defect - induced phase slips .",
    "now consider the interaction of two adjacent spin tubes , assuming no correlations between their substitution sites . due to the random phase slips in the spin",
    "spirals in each spin tube , inter - tube exchange interactions will average to zero at the mean field level .",
    "thus , 3d interactions that are critical for establishing long - range magnetic order at a finite temperature will be entirely wiped out by the _ random frustration",
    "_ introduced by bond disorder .",
    "this scenario is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] .",
    "while it is not directly supported by the experimental data , it appears very plausible in the particular case of scx .",
    "indeed , in our material , the inter - chain interactions are known to be weak.@xcite at the same time , due to the very large spin velocity ( temperature equivalent of about 150  k ) , one - dimensional correlations are already very well developed at the experimental temperatures of a few kelvin . in other words , upon cooling in a field , individual spin tubes are practically ordered , and it is the the inter - tube ordering that occurs at the transition point in the disorder - free material .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in the proposed scenario even _",
    "weak _ and sparse defects will suppress 3d order .",
    "indeed , even small phase slips induced by each impurity will , over large distances , lead to an accumulation of phase difference between adjacent spin tubes .",
    "this is a specific consequence of the incommensurate and quasi-1d nature of the disorder - free system .",
    "incommensurability and frustration being the key ingredients of our model makes it _ distinct _ from the basic mechanism of bose glasses .",
    "the latter emerges from the mapping the magnetic system onto a lattice gas of magnons with a spatially random chemical potential .",
    "neither incommensurability or frustration are explicitly present in the resulting bosonic hamiltonian , and are therefore overlooked by the approach . for our newly proposed mechanism , there are numerous theoretical questions to be further addressed .",
    "is there a critical strength of frustration disorder that is required to disrupt the magnon condensate ?",
    "what are the critical properties of the order / disorder transition induced by random frustration ?",
    "how does the random frustration physics interplay with that of the `` conventional '' bose glass ?",
