    "traditionally , the broader study of the formation , structure and evolution of galaxies largely excluded active galactic nuclei ( agn : distant quasars and nearby seyfert galaxies ) , whose energy output is primarily powered by the release of gravitational potential energy as material from the host galaxy is accreted by a central supermassive black hole .",
    "recently , however , it has been recognised that the growth and influence of the black hole , the formation / evolution of galaxies , star formation and nuclear activity at different cosmic epochs are intimately related ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that most bulge - dominated galaxies today harbor relic black holes from an early quasar phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "local galaxies are well - established , so re - ignition of dormant black holes is required to explain why ongoing activity is observed in only 10@xmath420% of galaxies , despite the ubiquity of black holes . a key question is whether the ignition mechanism is related to the galactic host properties ; numerical models predict large gas inflows due to gravitational torques in non - axisymmetric potentials related to bars or galaxy interactions @xcite , but the majority of optical / ir _ imaging _ studies have failed to find a clear distinction between seyfert host and inactive galaxy morphology on a range of scales that encompasses nearby companions and interactions , galactic bars and nuclear spirals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , recent nicmos imaging of the circumnuclear regions of 250 galaxies @xcite found significant isophotal twists and disturbances suggesting the possibility of identifiable _ dynamical _ differences between active and inactive hosts .",
    "removal of angular momentum and transportation of disk gas towards the nucleus may be driven by external mechanisms , such as tidal interaction or minor mergers , or internal instabilities such as bars and lopsided disks .",
    "hi is often the most spatially extended component of a galaxy s disk so is sensitive to interactions and minor mergers ; because gas is dissipative , it also responds in a highly non - linear way to small deviations from axial symmetry making it a valuable tracer of barred or weak oval potentials @xcite .",
    "hi synthesis imaging provides unique information on the global mass distribution and kinematics of the disk to large radii and a long - term dynamical history of the galaxy ; interactions and mergers alter disk gas masses , bars drive gas inwards and even small disturbances leave _ kinematic _ imprints",

    "our master sample is selected from the rsa catalogue with complete nuclear spectroscopic classification @xcite and comprises 39 seyfert galaxies , with v@xmath9 , @xmath10 mag , @xmath11 , paired with 39 control galaxies with carefully matched optical properties @xmath12 and hubble type , t ( rc3 classification plus visual confirmation of dss images ) .",
    "for the vhikings survey , the brightest 26 seyferts ( absolute nuclear v - band magnitudes @xmath13@xmath417.2 ) and their corresponding 26 control galaxies were selected from this master sample ( table 1 ) , plus fainter seyferts , m51 and m81 and their controls . figure [ sample ] shows a pair - wise comparison of some sample properties .",
    "the vhikings survey is motivated by single dish hi surveys of seyferts , which found @xmath140% of seyferts @xcite showed disturbed kinematic profiles different to those of normal galaxies and a larger scatter in the distributions of m@xmath14/l@xmath15 and m@xmath14/m@xmath16 ratios vs. hubble type , and detailed vla hi studies of individual seyfert hosts , which revealed tidal tails and intra - group gas @xcite , previously unknown dwarf galaxies close to , but distinct from main disks @xcite and non - linear gas dynamics , such as streaming shocks in bars @xcite .",
    "the vla in c - configuration was used with an instrumental setup that ensures sensitivity to column densities n@xmath17@xmath1810@xmath19  @xmath20 and a bandwidth corresponding to @xmath6v=1100  km  s@xmath21 ; this combination is proving valuable for accurate continuum subtraction and the detection of gas - rich dwarf galaxies with low optical surface brightness that are in the field of view and within the velocity range to be associated with the target galaxies .",
    "these satellites are often absent from archive data that fail to cover a sufficient velocity range .",
    "some of these satellites can be seen in figure [ hi ] , which shows a selection of hi maps of seyferts and controls ( c ) from the survey . wider comparisons with galaxies in the whisp survey @xcite is underway .",

    "this study was motivated by the clear inadequacy of single aperture spectra or long - slit data or imaging alone in the presence of complex host and nuclear kinematics .",
    "the data form part of a multiwavelength campaign to investigate host galaxy structure and kinematics on size scales ever - closer to the nucleus , aimed at identifying or eliminating possible agn triggering and fuelling mechanisms ( see also garca - burillo these proceedings ) .",
    "this work builds on our previous detailed studies of 2-d gaseous and stellar velocity fields of individual seyfert galaxies , such as ngc  4151 @xcite , ngc  2110 @xcite and ngc  1068 @xcite where evidence of gaseous streaming and inflow in the inner few kpc was identified , hinting at a mechanism for delivering gas to the circumnuclear regions .",
