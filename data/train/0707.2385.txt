    "recently , the star collaboration @xcite observed a @xmath2-@xmath1 correlation of particles associated with a jet in rhic collisions , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are respectively the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity differences measured relative to a trigger jet particle . the experimental measurements , as shown in fig . 1@xmath3 and discussed in detail in refs.@xcite , reveal the following features of the `` ridge phenomenon '' :    1 .",
    "there are particles associated with the trigger jet within a small cone of @xmath4 which belong to the remnants of the near - side jet component .",
    "the near - side jet yield is independent of the number of participants .",
    "2 .   in addition",
    ", there are particles associated with the trigger jet within a small range of @xmath0 around @xmath5 but distributed broadly in @xmath1 .",
    "these associated particles can be separated as the ridge component associated with the trigger jet .",
    "the yield of the ridge component increases approximately linearly with the number of participants and is nearly independent of ( i ) the flavor content , ( ii ) the meson / hyperon character , and ( iii ) the transverse momentum @xmath6 ( above 4 gev ) of the jet trigger @xcite .",
    "the ridge yield has a temperature that is similar ( but slightly higher ) than that of the inclusive yield , whereas the near - side jet component has an appreciably higher temperature .",

    "( b ) the unnormalized yield @xmath10 in the momentum kick model for the description of only the ridge component , calculated for @xmath11 gev with @xmath12 gev , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 gev .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    while many theoretical models have been proposed to discuss the jet structure and related phenomena @xcite , the ridge phenomenon has not yet been fully understood .",
    "we would like to propose a simple `` momentum kick model '' which gives the salient features of the ridge phenomenon .",
    "we would also like to discuss the related implications of using the ridge structure to probe the parton momentum distribution at the moment of the jet - parton collision .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the momentum kick model which involves the momentum kick along the jet direction and the parton momentum distribution at the moment of the jet - parton collision . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the parametrization of the initial parton momentum distribution . in section iv , we examine the effects of the momentum kick and the initial rapidity width on the final momentum distribution after the jet - parton collision . adopting the hadron - parton duality , we compare the experimental data with momentum kick model results in section v. in section vi , we study the ridge structure with identified particles . in section vii ,",
    "we examine other predictions of the momentum kick model . in section viii",
    ", we present the conclusions and discussions .",
    "experimental observation ( 3 ) above concerning the properties of the ridge particles implies that these particles are associated with partons in the produced dense medium and much less with ( i ) the flavor content , ( ii ) the meson / hyperon character , and ( iii ) the transverse momentum @xmath6 ( above 4 gev ) of the trigger jet .",
    "we are led to such a suggestion of medium partons because the associated ridge particles bear the same `` fingerprints '' as those of the inclusive particles , including their various particle yields increasing with the participant number and their having nearly similar temperatures .",
    "these characteristics suggest that the ridge particles originate from the same material as the produced partons of the dense medium , which later cool down and materialize also as inclusive particles",
    ".    experimental observation ( 2 ) above regarding the narrow @xmath0 correlation of the ridge particles with the jet implies that these ridge particles of the produced dense medium acquire their azimuthally properties from the jet .",
    "the most likely explanation is that these ridge particles are medium partons which suffer a collision with the jet and acquire a momentum kick and the jet s directionality .    therefore , to describe the ridge distribution",
    ", we propose a simple momentum kick model that incorporates the essential elements of the experimental observations .",
    "the momentum kick model contains the following ingredients :    1 .",
    "a near - side jet occurs near the medium surface and the jet collides with partons in the medium on its way to the detector .",
    "the jet - parton collision samples the momentum distribution of the collided medium partons at the moment of the jet - parton collision . because of the condition for the occurrence of the near - side jet , these collided medium partons are near the surface and each collided parton suffers at most one collision with the jet .",
    "3 .   the jet - parton collision imparts a momentum kick @xmath15 to the collided parton in the direction of the jet .",
    "the momentum kick modifies the parton initial momentum distribution @xmath16 to turn it into the collided parton final momentum distribution @xmath17 .",
    "after the collided partons hadronize and escape from the surface without further collisions , they materialize as ridge particles which retain the collided parton final momentum distribution .    in mathematical terms , the final momentum distribution of the medium partons which suffer a collision with the jet is , @xmath18 by normalizing the momentum kick distribution @xmath19 as @xmath20 the kinematic quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ensure the conservation of collided parton numbers before and after the jet - parton collision , @xmath23 in the context of the present paper , the initial and final moment distributions @xmath16 and @xmath17 refer to the momentum distributions before and after the jet - parton collision respectively , not to be confused with the initial and final momentum distributions at other instants of the nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "the momentum kick distribution @xmath24 for the momentum @xmath25 imparted from the jet to a collided medium parton is not a quantity that can be obtained from rigorous first - principles of qcd at present , as many non - perturbative properties of the medium and of the collision process are not known . for the present analysis , of particular interest",
    "are the general features of this momentum kick that a collided parton experiences . we know that this momentum kick will be distributed within a narrow cone along the jet direction .",
    "while a future refinement to describe this cone distribution is possible , it is illuminating at this stage to introduce as few parameters as possible for the description of this momentum kick , in order to spell out the dominant effects of the jet - parton collision process .",
    "accordingly , we shall use a single parameter @xmath26 to describe the momentum kick distribution simply as @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the unit vector along the jet direction .",
    "the simplicity of the model allows us to obtain analytically from eq .",

    "in eq .

    "the coordinate axes can be so chosen that the trigger jet lies in the @xmath33-@xmath32 plane .",

    "we need to convert @xmath43 to @xmath44 @xcite and we have @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the rest mass of the parton and @xmath47 .",
    "the above analytical results allow us to evaluate the momentum distribution of the collided partons .",
    "we also expect that as the near - side jet occurs near the medium surface , the collided partons also reside near the surface .",
    "the energetic collided partons will likely not suffer additional collisions before they hadronize and emerge from the surface as ridge particles .",
    "the ridge particles should possess the properties of the energetic collided parton final momentum distribution .",
    "we shall therefore assume hadron - parton duality and identify the momentum @xmath48 of the associated particles as the final momentum @xmath49 of the energetic partons after the jet - parton collision in eqs .",

    "we can consider an energetic quark parton [ or a @xmath52 color - triplet cluster parton of two antiquarks ] of various flavors and masses .",
    "the quark parton [ or the @xmath52 cluster parton ] can pick up an antiquark from the sea , which arises spontaneously in a quark - antiquark fluctuation in the medium , and can subsequently emerge out of the medium to become a colorless hadron .",
    "similarly , an energetic antiquark parton [ or a @xmath53 cluster parton of two quarks ] can pick up a sea quark and can subsequently emerge as a colorless hadron . on the other hand ,",
    "an energetic gluon parton can turn itself into a color - octet @xmath54 pair which can subsequently emit a soft gluon to become a colorless color - singlet @xmath55 quarkonium when it emerges from the medium . for energetic partons ,",
    "the loss of momentum and energy in picking up a sea quark or antiquark , or emitting a soft gluon , can be approximately neglected .",
    "the result is then the ( approximate ) parton - hadron duality for energetic partons we are considering in the present analysis .",
    "we shall describe the initial momentum distribution of partons on the right - hand side of eq .",

    "the peak of the ridge is shifted and located at @xmath209 , as mentioned previously . although the collided parton gains a momentum kick along the jet direction , the pseudorapidity of the peak is not at @xmath210 .",
    "it is shifted and appears at @xmath209 because the longitudinal momentum imparted on the partons is limited and has a magnitude of only @xmath12 gev , in the direction of the jet .",
    "this momentum kick shifts the parton longitudinal momentum of the partons only by about 0.8 unit , resulting in a @xmath209 relative to the incident jet of @xmath203 .",

    "we expect low-@xmath6 partons to be present at the moment of jet - parton collision and these partons can collide with the jet . under the action of a momentum kick , the initial parton momentum is related to the final parton momentum by @xmath211 for simplicity , we can focus our attention at final partons at @xmath212 with a trigger jet at @xmath196 , as other kinematic regions can be similarly analyzed . then",
    ", the magnitude of the initial parton transverse momentum is @xmath213 which has a minimum of zero at @xmath214 and it increases for @xmath215 and @xmath216 . in the momentum kick model , the final momentum distribution is given by the momentum distribution of the initial parton .",
    "one therefore expects that the final ( observed ) transverse momentum distribution of ridge particles has a peak at @xmath217 , decreasing on both sides for @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "because @xmath26 has been found to have the value of 0.8 gev , we therefore expect that the transverse momentum spectrum of ridge particles associated with the near - side jet will have a peak at @xmath220 gev at @xmath212 .",
    "the above prediction of the momentum kick model is based on the idealization of parton - hadron duality for which the momentum and energy loss due to the action of picking up a sea quark or antiquark , or emitting a soft gluon , can be approximately neglected . for low @xmath6 partons",
    ", these momentum and energy loss in the hadronization process may need to be corrected and accounted for , leading to modifications that will likely smear and shift the predicted peak of the transverse momentum distribution at @xmath221 . how the hadron - parton duality will be modified for these low @xmath6 partons will need to be investigated both experimentally and theoretically . in this connection",
    ", it is interesting to note that the experimental transverse spectra , @xmath134 , of particles associated with the near - side jet in the low @xmath6 region below 1 gev in central collisions is relatively flat , in contrast distinction to the exponentially - increasing @xmath134 spectrum of inclusive particles and the @xmath134 spectrum of particles associated with the away - side jet , as shown in fig . 3 of @xcite .",
    "these data of particles associated with a near - side jet in @xcite contain both the jet and the ridge components .",
    "it will be of great interest to separate out the near - side jet and the ridge components for low @xmath6 associated particles , to see whether a ridge exists and whether there is any evidence of a momentum kick suffered by the initial partons in producing these observed hadrons with low transverse momenta .",
    "the star collaboration has observed a @xmath0-@xmath1 correlation of particles associated with a jet in rhic collisions @xcite .",
    "the correlations can be decomposed into a near - side component as remnants of the trigger jet at @xmath118 and a ridge particle component at @xmath222 with a broad ridge structure in @xmath1 .",
    "these two components have very different characteristics .",
    "the ridge particles bear the same `` fingerprints '' as those of inclusive particles , including their particle yields increasing with increasing participant numbers and having nearly similar temperatures .",
    "these characteristics suggest that the ridge particles originate from the same material of the produced partons of the dense medium , which later also materialize as inclusive particles .",
    "the @xmath8 correlation of the ridge particles with the trigger jet suggests further that the ridge particles and the jet are related kinematically .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to propose the momentum kick model in which the ridge particles are identified as medium partons which suffer a collision with the jet and acquire a momentum kick along the jet direction .",
    "after the collided partons materialize as ridge particles and escape from the surface without additional collisions , they retain the collided parton final momentum distribution .",
    "the yield of the ridge particles associated with the jet therefore will depend on the momentum kick and the initial momentum distribution of the collided partons before the jet - parton collision .    to gain important insights into the ridge phenomenon , we idealize the momentum kick model by introducing as few parameters as possible . the relevant quantities are then the magnitude of the momentum kick @xmath26 along the jet direction imparted by the jet to the collided parton , and the initial parton momentum distribution represented by the rapidity width parameter @xmath57 and the transverse momentum temperature @xmath58 .    under the action of a jet - parton momentum kick ,",
    "a peak structure in @xmath0 arises . for the same final parton transverse momentum @xmath94 and various @xmath0 values",
    ", the jet - parton collision samples a smaller magnitude of initial parton transverse momentum @xmath97 at @xmath91 but it samples a larger magnitude of initial parton transverse momentum @xmath97 at @xmath103",
    ". as the initial transverse momentum distribution decreases rapidly with the initial transverse momentum @xmath97 as @xmath223 , there are more collided partons at @xmath91 than at @xmath102 , for the same observed final transverse momentum @xmath94 .",
    "the case of azimuthal angles between @xmath91 and @xmath103 gives a momentum distribution in between these two limits , resulting in a peak structure in @xmath0 centered at @xmath98 .",
    "this width of the distribution along the @xmath0 direction is sensitive to the magnitude of the momentum kick @xmath26 .",
    "a small value of @xmath26 will lead to a broad structure in @xmath85 .",
    "a large value of @xmath26 will lead to a narrow structure in @xmath85 .",
    "the experimental data suggest a a value of the momentum kick @xmath26 of 0.8 gev . as there is much that is not known about the non - perturbative properties of the medium and the collision processes , the experimental extraction of the jet - parton momentum kick provides useful information concerning the jet - parton collision and jet energy loss .",
    "while the peak structure along the @xmath85 direction at @xmath224 arises predominantly from the momentum kick , the ridge structure along the @xmath106 direction in the @xmath85-@xmath104 plane on the other hand reflects the initial rapidity distribution @xmath225 at the momentum of the jet - parton collision .",
    "thus , if the momentum kick model is indeed the correct mechanism , the ridge structure associated with the near - side jet may be used to probe the parton momentum distribution at the moment of the jet - parton collision .",
    "previous measurements of inclusive particle rapidity distribution at rhic for @xmath107 gev gives a width parameter @xmath105 which however leads to too steep a ridge slope in the momentum kick model to be favored by the experimental ridge distribution .",
    "the rapidity width @xmath226 extracted from the momentum kick model appears to be greater than the rapidity width extracted from the inclusive particle rapidity distribution .",
    "it is important to note that the rapidity width @xmath57 extracted from the momentum kick model measures the rapidity width @xmath227 at the moment of the jet - parton collision , where jpc stands for `` jet - parton collision '' .",
    "the jet - parton collision occurs early in the nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "the rapidity width @xmath57 measured by the inclusive particle distribution is the asymptotic rapidity width @xmath228 at the end point of the nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "not much is known experimentally about the evolution of the rapidity distribution of partons as a function of time .",
    "nevertheless , certain gross features can perhaps be inferred from general considerations , as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "9 . at the onset of the nucleus - nucleus collision at @xmath229 in the collider frame , the partons have rapidity distributions centered at the rapidities of the two colliding nuclei , each distribution having a rapidity width because of the fermi motion of the partons in the hadrons inside the nucleus .",
    "at a subsequent time @xmath230 , the partons will thermalize and the rapidity distribution will evolve from a two - center distribution into an overlapping three - center distribution , with the thermalized component at zero rapidity ( fig .",
    "the distributions on the two sides will move towards zero rapidity and will diminish their magnitudes , while the central distribution will gain in magnitude .",
    "the three - center distribution will eventually merge into a single distribution at times @xmath231 and @xmath232 in fig .",
    "9 . in this scenario ,",
    "the width @xmath227 should be larger than the asymptotic width @xmath228 , as the rapidity distribution at the moment of the jet - parton collision may only be in the early stage of the rapidity evolution from the two - center distribution to an overlapping three - center distribution and a merged single distribution .",
    "because of the complicated dynamics that enters into the evolution of the early rapidity distribution , it is possible that the rapidity distribution at this stage may be non - gaussian in shape .",
    "the determination of the full shape of the initial rapidity distribution will need the measurement of associated ridge particles at large values of @xmath233 .    in conclusion , we find that the ridge structure in the @xmath2-@xmath1 correlation associated with a near - side jet @xcite can be explained in terms of the momentum kick model in which the ridge particles are identified as medium partons which suffer a collision with the jet and acquire a momentum kick along the jet direction .",
    "if this is indeed the correct mechanism , the near - side jet may be used to probe the parton momentum distribution at the moment of jet - parton collision , leading to the result that at that instant the parton temperature is slightly higher and the rapidity width substantially greater than corresponding quantities of their evolution products of inclusive particles at the end point of the nucleus - nucleus collision .",
