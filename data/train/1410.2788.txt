    "analysis of the underlying biomolecular solvation is critical when carrying out quantitative descriptions of various important biological processes at the atomic level , such as protein folding and protein ligand bonding , dna recognition , transcription , and translation . from a biological perspective , solvation analysis",
    "is concerned with interactions between a solute macromolecule and surrounding solvent ions . from a mathematical perspective , these solute - solvent interactions may be represented via solvation energies with contributions from polar and nonpolar sources .",
    "the polar portion arises from electrostatic interactions , which may be represented with the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) model @xcite .",
    "the pb model provides a framework by which to model the distribution of electrostatic potential along the surface of a solute macromolecule within a surrounding solvent with a particular ionic concentration .    in the pb model ,",
    "the pb equation governing electrostatic potentials takes the form of a nonlinear elliptic equation on multiple domains with discontinuous dielectric coefficients across the molecular surface or solute - solvent interface @xcite .",
    "the pb equation can not be solved analytically for molecules with complex geometries , only admitting analytical solutions for shapes such as spheres or rods @xcite . however , solving the pb equation numerically also presents significant difficulties because of the discontinuous dielectric coefficients , singularities in the source - term , non - smoothness of the solution , and significant nonlinearity when strong ionic effects are present .",
    "recently , a pseudo - transient continuation approach has been proposed for solving the nonlinear pb ( npb ) equation @xcite , which creates a different way to tackle the nonlinear term of the npb equation . in classical finite difference and finite element solutions of the npb equation",
    ", a nonlinear algebraic system is typically formed through the discretization of the boundary value problem . a nonlinear relaxation method @xcite or inexact newton method @xcite",
    "can be employed to solve such a nonlinear system . in the pseudo - transient continuation approach @xcite",
    ", a pseudo - time derivative is added to the npb equation so that one solves an initial - boundary value problem now .",
    "the steady state solution of this problem gives rise to the solution to the original boundary value problem .",
    "numerically , it is desired that a large time step can be used so that the long time integration can be computed quickly .",
    "thus , the efficiency of a pseudo - time npb solver is directly related to its stability , which critically depends on the nonlinear term of the npb equation  a hyperbolic sine function that could be exponentially large .",
    "several time stepping schemes have been considered for solving the time dependent npb equation .",
    "the explicit euler solution is straightforward , but invokes a severe stability constraint @xcite .",
    "implicit time integrations have also been studied @xcite , for which care has to be exercised in handling the nonlinear term . in @xcite , a linearization technique based on the first order taylor expansion",
    "is proposed so that a linear system is formed at each step of the implicit euler integration .",
    "this linearization essentially evaluates the nonlinear term at the previous time instant .",
    "similarly , by treating the nonlinear term explicitly , a regularized alternating direction implicit ( adi ) method has been introduced in @xcite . since the thomas algorithm @xcite can be employed to solve the tridiagonal finite difference systems in this time splitting method",
    ", the efficiency is greatly improved .",
    "however , a very large time increment is still prohibited in these methods , because these implicit schemes are of semi - implicit nature .",
    "more recently , we have successfully developed two fully - implicit adi schemes @xcite for solving the time dependent npb equation .",
    "the success lies in an analytical integration of the nonlinear term , and the use of a time splitting framework .",
    "this completely suppresses the nonlinear instability , so that these fully - implicit adi schemes are unconditionally stable in solving benchmark problems with smooth solutions .",
    "however , for the solvation analysis in applications to real biomolecules , these adi schemes are still conditionally stable , probably because the underlying electrostatic potentials are non - smooth .",
    "nevertheless , these fully - implicit adi schemes are still found to be quite efficient , due to their high temporal accuracy and much relaxed courant - friedrich - lewy ( cfl ) constraints @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to introduce and investigate various new operator splitting methods for solving the time dependent npb equation .",
    "the present investigation will be conducted in the same pseudo - transient continuation framework as in @xcite . in particular , in spatial approximation , central finite difference will be employed to discretize the nonhomogeneous diffusion operator , which yields tridiagonal matrices in all dimension - splitting schemes . in temporal approximation , the analytical integration will be carried out for the split nonlinear subsystem .",
    "the ultimate goal of this work is to eventually construct unconditionally stable operator splitting methods for solving the npb equation in practical biomolecular applications .    in the existing fully - implicit operator splitting npb solvers @xcite ,",
    "the adi schemes are constructed based on the classical adi schemes @xcite . in the literature",
    ", there exists another family of multiplicative operator splitting methods , i.e. , the fractional step methods or locally one - dimensional ( lod ) methods , originally introduced by russian mathematicians @xcite . in the present setup ,",
    "the adi discretizations can be written as some perturbations of multidimensional discretizations of the implicit methods , such as the crank - nicolson and backward euler . in the proposed lod methods ,",
    "the similar splitting in alternating directions will be considered , but before the time discretization . in other words , the crank - nicolson and backward euler discretizations will be conducted after the differential equations are split .",
    "thus , the discretizations of the lod methods are truly one - dimensional .",
    "this is different from the adi methods , in which the right - hand side of the discretized equations contains derivatives from the other directions . comparing with the adi methods ,",
    "the lod methods tend to be more stable , but have a larger splitting error @xcite .",
    "moreover , a previous work on the application of adi and lod schemes to maxwell s equations in isotropic and lossless media found that the lod schemes were approximately 20% computationally less expensive than the adi schemes @xcite .",
    "other comparisons of lod schemes and traditional adi schemes as applied to maxwell s equations have also found lower computational costs for the lod methods over adi methods @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to develop several lod schemes for solving the time dependent npb equation in this work .    besides the adi and lod methods , there exists another family of operator splitting methods , i.e. , the additive operator splitting ( aos ) methods @xcite . in the aos methods , the time integration of each split subsystem can be independently carried out , while in the multiplicative operator splitting methods , the integration of the present fractional step needs the solution from the previous fractional steps .",
    "thus , the aos methods are well suited to be implemented in parallel processors .",
    "the stability and accuracy of the aos methods have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the application of additive operator splitting ( aos ) schemes has proved popular for the purposes of nonlinear diffusion filtering for image processing @xcite .",
    "the aos schemes are usually efficient and stable for relatively large @xmath0 values , although potentially less accurate than the lod schemes . however , their overall efficiency and simplicity merit further exploration . in the present paper , different formulations and discretizations of the aos methods for solving time",
    "dependent npb equation will be considered .",
    "previous work in image processing has also explored the properties of schemes combining multiplicative and additive operator splitting , finding higher levels of accuracy with such schemes than with simpler aos methods @xcite .",
    "we thus will also explore the construction and application of a multiplicative - additive operator splitting ( maos ) scheme for our current problem .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec.problem ]",
    ", we first introduce the physical background of the problem .",
    "the pseudo - transient pb model will then be presented .",
    "the existing adi schemes will be described and the remaining difficulties are discussed .",
    "the proposed operator splitting schemes will then be formulated for solving the time dependent npb equation in section [ sec.method ] .",
    "numerical validations of the proposed schemes through benchmark examples with analytical solutions are considered in section [ sec.validation ] , while various benchmark biological systems and subsequent free energy of solvation calculations are presented in section [ sec.application ] .",
    "finally , this paper ends with a conclusion .",
    "consider a solute macromolecule in space surrounded by a solvent aqueous solution .",
    "as defined in @xcite , the molecular surface , or solute - solvent boundary @xmath1 , of the macromolecule divides @xmath2 into the closed domain of the solute molecule @xmath3 and solvent domain @xmath4 .",
    "the electrostatic interaction of such a solute - solvent system is governed by the nonlinear poisson - boltzmann ( npb ) equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electrostatic potential and the source term @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8 the dielectric constant @xmath9 is piecewise such that @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 . here",

    "the modified debye - huckel parameter @xmath19 is defined as @xmath20 for @xmath13 and @xmath21 for @xmath11 , where @xmath22 is avogadro s number and @xmath23 is the molar ionic strength . at room temperature ( @xmath24 ) ,",
    "@xmath25@xmath26 from @xcite .",
    "the npb equation varies on the choice of units , and in the present setting we utilize the dimensionless form presented in @xcite .",
    "we may convert the dimensionless electrostatic potential @xmath6 to units kcal / mol/@xmath15 at room temperature ( @xmath24 ) through simply multiplying the potentials by 0.592183 @xcite .",
    "our numerical computations must take place on a finite domain @xmath27 .",
    "we may assign values along the boundary @xmath28 according to the approximate analytical condition @xmath29 when @xmath28 is of sufficient distance from the macromolecule subdomain @xmath3 , eq .",
    "( [ boundarycond ] ) can be utilized to approximate the results for potentials found from eq .",
    "( [ npb ] ) .",
    "we note here that eq .",
    "( [ boundarycond ] ) , for a collection of @xmath30 partial charges @xmath31 at positions @xmath32 , is simply a linear superposition of coulomb s law . for simplicity ,",
    "the boundary @xmath28 is assumed to be of a cubic shape .",
    "the computational simulation of the npb equation is of great importance for biomolecular modeling , but is quite challenging .",
    "numerous approaches have been developed in the literature ; see for example recent reviews @xcite and references therein .",
    "what are related to the present study is the pseudo - transient continuation approach for solving the npb equation @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the npb equation ( [ npb ] ) will be converted from its time independent form to a time dependent form by introducing a pseudo - transient variation , thus producing the time dependent npb : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a scaling parameter . to solve this initial boundary value problem",
    ", we must first specify an initial solution for our potential values , which may be either the trivial solution @xmath35 , or the electrostatic potential solved from the linear poisson - boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ timedepnpb ] ) is then numerically integrated over a sufficiently large time period to reach a steady state solution , thus essentially recovering the solution to the original npb equation ( [ npb ] ) .",
    "several time integration methods have been developed for solving the time dependent npb equation ( [ timedepnpb ] ) .",
    "a very small time increment @xmath0 is usually required in the explicit euler solution @xcite , which is inefficient for practical use .",
    "however , the construction of a fully implicit integration of the npb equation is hindered by the presence of the nonlinear hyperbolic sine term in the npb equation . by evaluating the nonlinear term at the previous time step ,",
    "the regular implementation of the implicit schemes usually gives rise to a semi - implicit integration @xcite .",
    "a breakthrough has been made in our recent study @xcite , in which fully implicit alternating direction implicit ( adi ) methods are developed for the first time in the literature .",
    "a generalized npb equation is considered in @xcite , while the similar adi schemes for the classical npb equation ( [ npb ] ) are introduced later in @xcite .",
    "the success of these adi schemes lies in an analytical integration of the nonlinear term in a time splitting framework . with this analytical treatment of the nonlinear term",
    ", unconditionally stable results are obtained in benchmark problems with smooth solutions .",
    "unfortunately , these operator splitting adi schemes are still conditionally stable when they are applied to real protein systems , because of various complex features of the biomolecular solvation analysis , including complicated molecular surfaces , singular source charges , discontinuous dielectric coefficients , and nonsmooth electrostatic potentials @xcite .",
    "we thus are motivated to develop novel numerical schemes which may be both computationally less expensive as well as more stable for significantly larger @xmath0 values than the previously presented adi schemes .    for a comparison",
    ", two adi schemes presented @xcite will also be examined in this work .",
    "we thus briefly review these two methods here . in the first order adi scheme ( _ adi1 _ ) @xcite , at each time step from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , the time dependent npb equation ( [ timedepnpb ] ) is solved by a first order time splitting method in two stages .",
    "an analytical integration of the nonlinear term is conducted in the first stage .",
    "the nonhomogeneous diffusion equation of the second stage is first discretized by the implicit euler scheme in time and the finite difference method in space .",
    "the multidimensional system is then solved by a classical douglas - rachford adi scheme , by splitting the system into many one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems of a tridiagonal structure .",
    "similarly , in the second order adi scheme ( _ adi2 _ ) @xcite , a second order time splitting with three stages is considered with analytical treatments in the first and last stages .",
    "the crank - nicholson scheme is considered in the second stage , and is realized via a douglas adi implementation .",
    "the _ adi2 _",
    "scheme is generally more accurate than the _ adi1 _",
    "scheme , though it is computationally more expensive @xcite .",
    "the time splitting or operator splitting methods are powerful tools for solving time dependent partial differential equations . besides the adi schemes ,",
    "there exist many other operator splitting methods in the literature that can reduce a multidimensional problem to sets of independent 1d problems . with the central difference approximation in space , these 1d systems will have tridiagonal structures , so that they can be efficiently solved using the thomas algorithm @xcite .",
    "several commonly used operator splitting methods will be explored in this paper , for the purpose of eventually developing unconditionally stable schemes for solving the time dependent npb equation .",
    "we adopt the following notations in this work . following the tradition of the biomolecular simulation",
    ", we consider a uniform mesh with grid spacing @xmath38 in the @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 directions , with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 being the number of grip points in each direction , respectively .",

    ", we can improve the result by considering the vacuum potentials generated by the fft and lod methods . in part ( d ) , the recovered solution defined as @xmath149 is utilized .",
    "visually , this new result is close to those of the adi methods .",
    "hence , the recovered lodie2 re+v potential can also be similarly used in analyzing the fast / slow electrostatic potential changing region on the solute - solvent boundary for biomolecular studies .",
    "the present study demonstrates that besides providing a reliable free energy estimation , the proposed lodie method can also generate a usable pointwise potential .",
    "this paper presents the first unconditionally stable numerical scheme for solving the nonlinear poisson - boltzmann ( npb ) equation in a pseudo - transient approach . using this approach ,",
    "the solution to the npb equation is recovered from the steady state solution to the time dependent pseudo - transient form . however , due to the long time integration of the process , it is necessary to develop numerical schemes that are stable and accurate for large time increments .",
    "the alternating direction implicit ( adi ) methods previously developed for solving the time dependent npb equation @xcite are fully implicit , but are still conditionally stable . to construct unconditionally stable solution of the unsteady npb equation , we consider various operator splitting procedures to all five terms of the npb equation , in both multiplicative and additive styles .",
    "this gives rise to locally one - dimensional ( lod ) schemes , additive operator splitting ( aos ) schemes , and multiplicative - additive operator splitting ( maos ) scheme . in these schemes ,",
    "the nonlinear term is analytically integrated , and both implicit euler and crank - nicholson time integrations are formulated .",
    "a standard finite difference scheme is utilized for spatial discretization in all schemes .",
    "extensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify the unconditional stability and accuracy of the proposed time splitting schemes .",
    "one lod scheme is found to outperform other schemes in terms of both stability and accuracy , and is recommended for electrostatic free energy analysis of real proteins .",
    "further improvements are introduced to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of this lod scheme for a fast biomolecular simulation .      *",
    "* stability . * for smooth solution , all proposed time splitting methods should be unconditionally stable , because each individual implicit euler or crank - nicolson time integration with central difference approximation is unconditionally stable . a major task in our numerical experiments",
    "is to verify the stability for non - smooth solutions . in case of a simple spherical cavity test ,",
    "these methods remain unconditionally stable . for real protein systems ,",
    "only the lodie methods are stable for any @xmath0 .",
    "some proposed methods , such as aosie1 , aoscn1 , and lodcn methods , become conditionally stable , while other methods , such as aosie2 , aoscn2 , maos methods , are stable for all @xmath150 .",
    "overall , the stability constraints of the proposed time splitting methods are much improved in comparing with the existing adi methods .",
    "the lodie method is the most stable method . * * accuracy . *",
    "because the charge singularities ( the delta functions ) and the non - smoothness of the solution across the interface @xmath1 are treated in an approximate sense in the present central difference discretization , all numerical schemes achieve roughly the first - order convergence in space .",
    "all proposed time splitting methods are of first order accuracy in time , because the underlying time splitting is first order and the discretization error of the implicit euler or crank - nicolson integration is at least first order .",
    "however , as shown in protein tests , a very small @xmath0 has to be used in order to produce an accurate estimate of electrostatic free energy .",
    "a richardson extrapolation technique and a recovery based on the replacement of the fast fourier transform method by the operator splitting method are proposed to significantly improve the precision in energy calculations .",
    "the accelerated lodie method becomes biologically useful , with a large @xmath151 and a stopping time @xmath152 .",
    "* * efficiency .",
    "* by using central difference discretization , the resulting linear systems in each alternating direction are tridiagonal , and can be efficiently solved via the thomas algorithm @xcite . without the loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that the numbers of grid nodes along @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 directions are all on the order @xmath153 .",
    "then , the linear system in each subsystem of the time splitting procedure has the dimensions @xmath154 .",
    "the thomas algorithm solution of such a system has a complexity on the order of @xmath155 , so that the operations for calculating one time step in the proposed time splitting methods are on the order of @xmath156 . since a fixed number of total time steps is used in the lodie solution , the overall complexity of the proposed lodie method is still @xmath156 , making this method very attractive to large protein systems .",
    "as demonstrated in our cpu tests , the lodie method scales linearly with respect to the number of atoms of the protein . on average ,",
    "the unconditionally stable lodie method is over 20 times more efficient than the conditionally stable adi methods for large proteins .",
    "it is of great interest to further generalize the proposed time splitting methods by considering other numerical difficulties associated with the npb equation .",
    "a regularization procedure to treat the source singularities is under our investigation .",
    "the use of a different molecular surface definition will also be examined .",
