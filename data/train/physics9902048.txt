    "in his 1905 paper on special relativity  @xciteeinstein showed that time dilatation ( td ) and the lorentz - fitzgerald contraction ( lfc ) , which had previously been introduced in a somewhat ad hoc way into classical electrodynamics , are simple consequences of the lorentz transformation ( lt ) , that is , of the geometry of space - time .",
    "as an example of the lfc einstein stated that a sphere moving with velocity @xmath2 would , ` viewed from the stationary system ' , appear to be contracted by the factor @xmath3 in its direction of motion where @xmath4 is the velocity of light in free space .",
    "it was only pointed out some 54 years later that if ` viewed ' was interpreted in the conventional sense of ` as seen by the eye , or recorded on a photograph ' then the sphere does not at all appear to be contracted , but is still seen as a sphere with the same dimensions as a stationary one and at the same position  @xcite !",
    "it was shown in general  @xcite that transversely viewed moving objects subtending a small solid angle at the observer appear to be not distorted in shape or changed in size , but rather rotated , as compared to a similarly viewed and orientated object at rest .",
    "this apparent rotation is a consequence of three distinct physical effects :    * the lfc .",
    "* optical aberration . *",
    "different propagation times of photons emitted by different parts of the moving object .    the effect ( ii ) may be interpreted as the change in direction of photons , emitted by a moving source , due to the lt between the rest frames of the source and the stationary observer .",
    "correcting for ( ii ) and ( iii ) , the lfc can be deduced as a physical effect , if not directly observed .",
    "it was also pointed out by weinstein  @xcite that if a single observer is close to a moving object then , because of the effect of light propagation time delays it will appear elongated if moving towards the observer and contracted ( to an extent greater than the lfc ) if moving away .",
    "only an object moving strictly transversely to the line of sight of a close observer shows the lfc",
    ".    however , the lfc itself is a physical phenomenon similar in many ways to ( iii ) above . a photograph or the human eye record as a sharp image the photons incident on it at a fixed time .",
    "that is , the image corresponds to a projection at constant time in the frame s of observation .",
    "this implies that the photons constituting the image are emitted at different times from the different parts , along the line of sight , of an extended object .",
    "the lfc is similarly defined by a fixed time projection in the frame s.",
    "the lt then requires that the photons constituting the image of a moving object are also emitted at different times , in the rest frame s of the object , from the different parts along its direction of motion . in the following s",
    "will , in general , denote the reference frame of a ` stationary ' observer ( space - time coordinates x , y , z , t ) while s refers to the rest frame of an object moving with uniform velocity @xmath2 relative to s ( space - time coordinates x,y,z,t ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to point out that the @xmath5 constant projection of the lfc and the @xmath6 constant projection of td are not the only physically distinct space time measurements ( stm ) possible within special relativity .",
    "in fact , as will be demonstrated below , there are two others : space dilatation ( sd ) , the @xmath7 constant projection and time contraction ( tc ) , the @xmath8 constant projection .",
    "the overall situation with respect to apparent distortions of space - time is thus symmetric with respect to space and time .",
    "the @xmath5 constant projection of the lfc is the stm appropriate to the ` moving bodies ' of einstein s original paper and to the photographic recording technique .",
    "this medium has no intrinsic time resolution and relies on that provided by a rapidly moving shutter to provide a clear image . the lfc ` works ' as a well defined physical phenomenon because the ` measuring rod ' or other physical object under observation has a lifetime that is long in comparison with the time interval required to make an observation , and so constitutes a continuous source of emitted or reflected photons , such that some are always available in the different space ( @xmath9 ) and time ( @xmath10 ) intervals in s for every position of the rod corresponding to the time interval @xmath11 around @xmath5 constant in the observer s frame s. if , however , the physical object of interest has internal motion ( rotation , expansion or contraction ) or is only illuminated , in its rest frame s , during a short time interval , the above conditions , that assure that the @xmath5 constant projection gives a well defined stm no longer apply . in the following , for brevity , all such objects of limited luminous lifetime in their own rest frame",
    "will be referred to as ` transient luminous objects ' or tlo . for such objects",
    "it is natural to define a length measurement by taking the @xmath7 constant projection in s.    space time measurements of such transient luminous objects are discussed below in section 3 .",
    "a simple conceptual camera of finite time resolution is considered .",
    "practical examples are a flash camera or a tv raster .",
    "the camera is used to record image plane coordinates ( ipc ) @xmath12 in the observation frame s. to orient the discussion answers will be sought to the question :  what information about transient luminous objects (  observed in general as a correlated ensemble of stm in the frame s ) such as its distance , shape , orientation or lifetime can be derived _ only _ from measurements of the image plane coordinates ?",
    "the case of stationary objects is first considered in section 2 , followed by the discussion of uniformly ( transversely ) moving objects in the following section .    in section 4 time measurements other than the conventional td ( @xmath6 constant projection ) of special relativity",
    "are considered .",
    "the td phenomenon refers only to a local clock , in the sense that its position in the frame s is invariant ( say at the spatial origin of coordinates ) .",
    "however the time recorded by any synchronised clock in the same inertial frame is , by definition , identical .",
    "einstein used such an array of ` equivalent clocks ' situated at different positions in the same inertial frame in his original discussion of the relativity of simultanaeity  @xcite .",
    "the question addressed in section 4 is : what will an observer in s see if he looks not only at a given local clock in s , but also at other equivalent clocks at different positions in s , in comparison to a standard clock at rest in his own frame ?",
    "it is shown that such equivalent clocks may be seen to run slower than , or faster than , the td prediction for a local clock .",
    "in particular they may even appear to _ run faster than the standard clock_. this is an example of the time contraction effect mentioned above .",
    "it is part of common experience that distant objects appear smaller than similar ones that are close to the observer .",
    "this is because the human visual system functions as a camera . in fig 1",
    "is shown a schematic camera where a number of planar objects @xmath13,@xmath14,@xmath15,@xmath16 of different shape , orientation and distance produce an identical image ( a square ) in the image plane of the camera .",
    "the lens of the latter will be considered in the following discussion to be a simple pin - hole .",
    "if the size and orientation of the object is known then its distance @xmath17 from the position @xmath18 of the camera lens along the z - axis may be deduced from measurements of its image by simple geometry .",
    "for example a rod of known length @xmath19 , whose centre lies on the z - axis , and is orientated parallel to @xmath20 is at the distance @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the length of the image of the rod and @xmath23 is the distance between the lens and the image plane of the camera .    the problem addressed now is how the real dimensions and positions of a physical object may , in general , be deduced only from measurements made in the image plane of the camera shown in fig 1 .",
    "one possiblity is to send a pulse of light with a sharp time distribution at a known time from a source near the camera and to measure the time delay and the positions of the photons scattered back into the camera .",
    "this is the principle of radar ranging measurements . here",
    "a different , although related , method will be used where the camera requires no external time reference . in the present section",
    "the method will be applied to objects at rest relative to the camera , while in the following section it is applied to objects in uniform transverse motion with respect to the camera axis . in this case",
    "effects of special relativity must be taken into account .",
    "two different lamps l1 , l2 are used to illuminate the object of interest with a sharp pulse of light whose width must be smaller than @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the typical transverse dimension of the object . the lamps l1 , l2 are used as a source of correlated space - time events in the rest frame of the object of interest , that is to produce a tlo of well defined properties .",
    "they are not however essential for the following considerations",
    ". the surfaces of the objects could just as well be equipped with an array of discrete light sources ( e.g. light - emitting diodes ) programmed so as to emit light pulses at different values of @xmath26 , the proper time of the object , depending on their position .",
    "the lamp l1 is situated in such a position that the photons scattered from different parts of the surface arrive simulaneously at the image plane of the camera .",
    "is negligible as compared to unity ] that is the position of the lamp is such that the ` trivial ' light propagation time differences from different parts of the object to the camera are compensated .",
    "if l1 lies in the plane spanned by the z - axis and a normal to the surface of the object , then the angle @xmath27 ( fig 2 ) is given by : @xmath28 the lamp l2 is placed along the normal to the surface of the object on the same side as the camera .",
    "thus the scattering time of the signal from l2 corresponds to a fixed proper time in the rest frame of the ( planar ) object . in order that the light from the lamps may enter the camera in the absence of specular reflection",
    "the surfaces of the objects should be diffuse reflectors .",
    "if the lamps are sufficiently distant the impinging light pulse can be considered to be a narrow planar wave packet .",
    "for each of the objects @xmath13-@xmath16 the light pulse from l1 gives a sharp ( in time ) square image in the camera ( fig 3c ) .",
    "no information is therefore available as to which of the four objects in fig 1 produced the image .",
    "for the lamp l2 , because of light propagation time differences , each object produces a clearly distinguishable image , a line moving in a distinct direction , the extremities of which sweep out the same square outline ( figs 3a , b , d ) or , for @xmath15 , an instantaneous square image indistinguishable , shadow the central region of the square image .",
    "this inessential complication does not arise if @xmath15 is self luminous . ] from that produced by the lamp l1 ( fig 3c ) .",
    "the orientation of the moving line image defines that of the surface of the object .",
    "it is perpendicular to the projection of the normal to the surface on to the image plane .",
    "it is now demonstrated that analysis of the time dependant images of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath16 enables each object to be spatially reconstructed . allowing for light propagation delays , the ensemble of space - time points constituting the tlo",
    "may then also be calculated .    as an example",
    "the image produced by @xmath16 using the lamp l2 is now analysed .",
    "the times for the line to move from the right extremity of the square to the centre , and from the centre to the left extremity are denoted by @xmath29 , @xmath30 respectively . with @xmath31 , and other geometrical definitions as in fig 4a , then : @xmath32 } \\cos \\delta \\\\",
    "\\delta t_2^{l2 } & = & \\frac{(2ld_2 \\tan \\alpha + d_2 ^ 2 \\sec^2 \\alpha ) } { c[l(1+\\cos \\delta)+d_2 \\tan \\alpha ] } \\cos \\delta\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath33 in eqns(2.2),(2.3 ) light propagation time differences inside the camera are neglected . with the further assumptions @xmath34 ,   @xmath35",
    "eqns(2.2),(2.3 ) simplify to : @xmath36 denoting by @xmath37 the size of the side of the square swept out by the moving line image in fig 3d then : @xmath38 eqns(2.4 - 2.7 ) have the following solution : @xmath39 where : @xmath40 thus the position , orientation and physical dimensions of @xmath16 are completely specified by measurements of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath37 , and the orientation of the moving line image .",
    "similar calculations may be performed , _ mutandis mutandi _ for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the object @xmath15 is a special case .",
    "since @xmath43 it must be orientated perpendicular to oz .",
    "however no information can be obtained , using the lamp l2 , about its position and size .",
    "the observation of the object @xmath16 described in the previous section is is now repeated in the case that @xmath16 and the lamps l1,l2 are moving with a constant velocity @xmath44 relative to the camera and parallel to o@xmath45 .",
    "a coordinate system is defined in the moving frame s with origin at q and axes q@xmath46 , q@xmath47 , q@xmath48 parallel to o@xmath45 , o@xmath49 , o@xmath50 ( fig 4 ) .",
    "the frame , at rest relative to the camera , whose origin coincides with q at @xmath51 , and with @xmath52 and @xmath53 axes parallel to o@xmath45 and o@xmath49 respectively is denoted by s. it is further assumed that the light pulses from l1 and l2 arrive at q at time @xmath54 . to calculate the moving image observed in the camera under these conditions",
    "the light propagation times found in the previous section may be used after first performing the lt of space - time points beween the frames s and s : @xmath55 where @xmath56 the results of the lt for the points p , q , r of @xmath16 are summarised in tables 1 and 2 , for observations using lamps l1 and l2 respectively , under the conditions described above .",
    "the fourth column of table 2 is an example of the following general result ( space dilatation ) referred to in the introduction :         eqn.(5.5 ) describes the lfc effect , while combining eqns.(5.5 ) and ( 5.6 ) to eliminate @xmath58 yields the equation for the complementary effect . by taking other projections the other entries of table 7",
    "may be calculated in a similar fashion .",
    "it is interesting to note that the td effect can be derived directly from the lfc effect by using the symmetry of the lt equations . introducing the notation : @xmath59",
    ", the lt may be written as : @xmath60 these equations are invariant yields the inverse of the lt ( 5.7),(5.8 ) .",
    "the inverse equations may then be solved to recover ( 5.7 ) and ( 5.8 ) ] under the following transformations : @xmath61 writing out the lfc entries in the first row of table 7 , replacing @xmath62 , @xmath26 by @xmath63 , @xmath64 ; gives @xmath65 applying @xmath66 to each entry in this row results in : @xmath67 applying @xmath68 : @xmath69 replacing @xmath70 , @xmath71 by @xmath72 , @xmath73 yields the last row of table 7 which describes the td effect .",
    "similarly tc can be derived from sd ( or vice versa ) by successively applying the transformations @xmath66 , @xmath68 .    a remark on the ` observed quantities ' in table 7 .",
    "for the lfc , sd the observed quantity is a length interval in the frame s. the apparent space distortion occurs because this length differs from the result of of a similar measurement made on the same object in its own rest frame .",
    "@xmath9 is not directly measured at the time of observation of the lfc or sd .",
    "it is otherwise with the time measurements td , tc . here",
    "the time interval _ in their own rest frame _ indicated by a moving clock ( td ) , or different equivalent clocks at the same position in s ( tc ) , is supposed to be directly observed and compared with the time interval @xmath11 registered by an unmoving clock in the observer s rest frame .",
    "thus the effect refers to two simultaneous observations by _ the same observer _ not to separate observations by _ two different observers _ as in the case of the lfc and sd .",
    "einstein s great achievement in his first paper on special relativity  @xcite was , for the first time , to clearly disentangle in classical electromagnetism , the purely geometrical and kinematical effects embodied in the lorentz transformation from dynamics . in spite of this , papers still appear from time to time in the literature claiming that moving objects ` really ' contract  @xcite or that moving clocks ` really ' run slow  @xcite for dynamical reasons , or even that such dynamical effects are the true basis of special relativity and should be taught as such  @xcite . as it has been shown above that a moving object",
    "can apparently shrink or expand , and identical moving clocks can apparently run fast or slow , depending only on how they are observed , it is clear that they can not ` really ' shrink , or run slow , respectively .",
    "if a moving object actually shrinks for dynamical reasons it is hard to see how the same object , viewed in a different way ( in fact only illuminated differently in its own rest frame ) can be seen to expand . certainly both effects can not be dynamically explained .",
    "in fact the lorentz transformation , as applied to space - time , describes only the _ appearance _ of space - time events , a purely geometrical property .",
    "the apparent distortions are of geometrical origin , the space - time analogues of the apparent distortions of objects in space , described by the laws of perspective , when they are linearly projected into a two dimensional sub - space by a camera or the human eye .      *",
    "if a luminous object , lying along the ox axis at rest in the frame s , has a short luminous lifetime in this frame , it will be observed from a frame s , in uniform motion relative to s parallel to ox at the velocity -@xmath74 , as a narrow line , perpendicular to the x - axis , moving with the velocity @xmath75 in the same direction as the moving object .",
    "the total distance swept out along the @xmath52-axis by the moving line during the time @xmath76 , for which the moving line image exists , is @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the length of the object as observed in s. thus the apparent length of the object when viewed with a time resolution much larger than @xmath76 is @xmath77 .",
    "any effects of lptd are not taken into account . *",
    "the equivalent clocks in the moving frame s , viewed at the same position in the stationary frame s , apparently run faster by a factor @xmath79 relative to a clock at rest in s.        99 a.einstein,`zur elektrodynamik bewegter krper ' , annalen der physik * 17 * ( 1905 ) , 891 .",
