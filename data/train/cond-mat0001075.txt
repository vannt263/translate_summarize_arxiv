    "measurement of the electromagnetic response of materials at microwave frequencies is important for both fundamental and practical reasons .",
    "the complex conductivity of metals and superconductors gives insights into the physics of the quasiparticle excitations and collective charge properties of the material .",
    "interesting collective behavior which can be investigated through the complex conductivity includes superconductivity , spin and charge density waves , josephson plasmons , etc .",
    "the dielectric properties of materials give insights into the polarization dynamics of insulators and ferroelectrics . a class of interesting insulating materials , the parent compounds of cuprate superconductors , combine both dielectric and antiferromagnetic behavior because of strong correlations between the charge carriers .",
    "ferromagnetic materials interact with microwaves in several unusual ways , including ferromagnetic resonance and anti - resonance , and spin - wave resonance .",
    "in addition , a series of discoveries over the past several decades have found many materials which display coexistence of superconductivity with either antiferromagnetism , or modified forms of ferromagnetism .",
    "this wide range of interesting electromagnetic behavior of contemporary materials requires that experimentalists working in this field master many diverse measurement techniques and have a broad understanding of condensed matter physics .    on the practical side ,",
    "electromagnetic measurements are essential for creating new device technologies and optimizing existing devices and processes .",
    "for example , nonlinearities in superconducting materials limit their applications at microwave frequencies to relatively low power uses .",
    "although intrinsic nonlinearities of superconductors will eventually limit their utility , most practical nonlinearities are caused by extrinsic defects in the material or device .",
    "careful characterization of these materials on the length scale of the extrinsic inhomogeneities is required to tackle this problem .",
    "another practical issue is the optimization of materials for frequency - agile applications .",
    "here the issue is measurement of dielectric or magnetic properties which can be tuned with an electric or magnetic field , often in thin - film materials .",
    "yet another important application of electromagnetic measurements is in diagnostic measurements .",
    "for example , in a semiconductor integrated circuit process , one needs to measure and control quantities such as sheet resistance , doping profiles , and electromigration in wires . as the speed of microprocessors continues to climb",
    ", the microwave properties of materials become increasingly important . finally , if high - speed integrated circuits fail , it is important to locate the fault ( often an open or short ) as accurately as possible , and to correct the problem quickly to maintain a high yield .",
    "electromagnetic measurements are thus an important foundation for many emerging technologies .    in this paper we present a new paradigm for electromagnetic measurements of materials .",
    "we first briefly review the traditional methods of microwave measurements and point out some of their important limitations .",
    "we then present an alternative approach to these measurements through quantitative near - field microwave microscopy .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to reviewing the progress we have made in this exciting new field of research .",
    "the fundamental electrodynamic quantities of greatest interest are the surface impedance z@xmath0 , the conductivity @xmath1 , the dielectric permittivity @xmath2 , and the magnetic permeability @xmath3 .",
    "a review of the definitions of conductivity and surface impedance of normal metals and superconductors is given elsewhere in this book .",
    "all of these quantities are complex and in general are a function of many variables , including frequency , temperature , magnetic field , electric field , etc .",
    "traditional microwave measurements of these quantities are typically done on length scales of the free - space wavelength of the signal , which is about 3 cm at 10 ghz .",
    "the earliest microwave measurements on superconductors by pippard were done with the sample acting as a quarter - wavelength resonator @xcite . in this case",
    "the electromagnetic properties measured are actually an average of the properties along the sample , weighted by the form of the standing - wave resonance pattern . in the case of elemental pb or sn",
    "this is not much of an issue , but in the case of complicated multi - element oxides it can give rise to misleading results .    a refinement of this technique came through the use of cavity perturbation methods . in this case",
    "the sample is immersed in a larger electromagnetic cavity in a region of uniform electric or magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the properties of the sample can be deduced by comparing the resonant frequency shift and quality factor change from a well - characterized initial ( unperturbed ) state of the cavity . in this case one",
    "measures an average of the electromagnetic properties of the sample , again weighted by the distribution of fields and currents created in the sample @xcite .",
    "these field and current distributions can be quite complicated for most practical samples @xcite , becoming simple only for carefully shaped ellipsoids of revolution .",
    "other resonant techniques have been developed in recent years , particularly for examination of thin - film superconducting materials .",
    "these include the parallel - plate resonator technique , in which two congruent films form a transmission line resonator with a length scale on the order of the microwave wavelength @xcite .",
    "dielectric resonators are also sensitive to thin - film surface impedance but are averaged over an area on the order of the wavelength @xcite .",
    "far - field surface - impedance microscopy techniques use a diffraction - limited beam in a confocal geometry to locally measure the surface impedance at millimeter - wave frequencies , but have a spatial resolution limited to a few millimeters @xcite .",
    "non - resonant methods can also be employed to measure electrodynamic properties .",
    "for instance , waveguide transmission through thin films has been successful at determining the absolute value of the penetration depth , but provides an average of the properties over the film , again on the length scale of the microwave wavelength .",
    "although traditional electrodynamics measurement techniques have been very successful , they do suffer from some fundamental limitations .",
    "first , they tend to measure a weighted average over large areas of the sample , on the scale of millimeters to centimeters . in the case of oxide",
    "thin films , it is often difficult to prepare a material which is homogeneous on such long length scales . for oxide",
    "single crystals , doping inhomogeneities have been shown to exist on many length scales from the nanometer to the millimeter range @xcite .",
    "in addition , surface morphology and second phases ( such as flux particles ) complicate the response of the crystal to electromagnetic radiation . hence",
    ", traditional electrodynamics measurements yield only an average or overall picture of the sample properties .",
    "this means that the intrinsic behavior of the material can be masked by the response of a relatively small fraction of extrinsic or second - phase material .",
    "when new materials are measured , there is often a lingering doubt whether the response is due to new intrinsic physics or some unforeseen extrinsic effect .",
    "a second limitation of traditional techniques is the generation of large screening currents , especially near edges , and in the case of superconductors , the subsequent admission of rf magnetic flux into the sample",
    ". the rf flux will significantly increase the surface impedance and can easily dominate the response of the material .",
    "such issues have arisen many times in the exploration of electromagnetic properties of new superconducting materials . for instance , early measurements of the penetration depth in thin films of ybco were corrupted by vortex entry into the films @xcite ; harmonic generation in superconducting crystals can be dominated by edge effects @xcite ; and the nonlinear meissner effect in superconductors can be swamped easily by vortex entry problems @xcite .",
    "to overcome the limitations of traditional electrodynamics measurements , we have developed a new family of near - field microwave microscopes which permit local quantitative measurements of surface impedance and conductivity , as well as dielectric and magnetic properties .",
    "near - field techniques also relieve us from the `` light - cone constraint '' , in which the length scales that we can probe with electromagnetic radiation are dictated by the frequency .",
    "for instance , this permits broadband electrodynamics measurements to be performed on very fine length scales . because the spatial resolution is determined by geometrical features which we can control , a class of altogether new electromagnetic experiments can be performed .",
    "for example , we now can measure the local tunability of high - frequency electrical properties and make new connections between microstructure and its associated physical properties .",
    "near - field microwave microscopy is an art which has formed gradually over the years from many different sources . in principle",
    "the intellectual founder of the near - field microscopy effort was synge in his prescient paper of 1928 @xcite . however , most practitioners of the art are not familiar with this seminal work despite its importance .",
    "many near - field techniques were developed empirically , some , in fact , developed to solve practical problems in manufacturing .",
    "the earliest effort to perform high resolution quantitative microwave measurements seems to be from the ferromagnetic resonance community , led by the work of frait @xcite , and later soohoo @xcite .",
    "however , not all subsequent developments can be traced back to these roots .    to codify the great variety of work on near - field microwave microscopy of materials",
    ", we present a simple picture of the five basic types of microwave microscopy in fig .",
    "although these classifications are somewhat gross , they allow us to cleanly distinguish the main efforts in the field .",
    "[ fig1](a ) illustrates a traditional microwave cavity resonator with a small hole in one wall .",
    "the sample is placed in close proximity to the wall ; a small region of the sample , defined by the hole diameter , perturbs the resonant frequency ( causing a frequency shift @xmath4f ) and quality factor ( q ) of the resonator . because the hole is so small ( 0.5 mm diameter for frait @xcite ) and the sample makes such a small perturbation to the cavity",
    ", one must examine a highly lossy property of the sample , such as ferromagnetic resonance .",
    "ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) gives information about the local internal fields and magnetization of the sample .",
    "frait @xcite , soohoo @xcite and bhagat @xcite have successfully used this microscope for fmr imaging , while ikeya @xcite has used it for electron spin resonance imaging .    an important variation on this theme",
    "was developed by ash and nichols @xcite .",
    "they used an open hemispherical resonator with a flat - plate reflector .",
    "the plate had a small hole in it and the sample was positioned close to this hole , but outside the resonator .",
    "they did not study fmr , so in order to recover a perturbation signal from the resonator , the sample separation from the hole was modulated at a fixed frequency .",
    "they were able to phase - sensitively recover the reflected signal from the resonator to construct a qualitative image of the sample as it was scanned under the hole .",
    "these cavity methods all make use of an evanescent mode to couple the resonant cavity to a local part of the sample . in that sense",
    "these methods resemble the tapered optical fiber with aperture method of near - field scanning optical microscopy ( nsom ) @xcite .",
    "[ fig1](b ) illustrates a class of non - resonant microscopes in which the sample is placed on or near the end of a microwave transmission line .",
    "the complex reflectivity r or transmission coefficient t is measured , and properties of the sample are deduced . the most common technique is to measure reflectivity from a coaxial transmission line terminated ( possibly with an air gap ) by the sample @xcite .",
    "variations include the use of waveguides @xcite , waveguides covered by a resonant slit @xcite and microstrip lines @xcite in reflection .",
    "transmission measurements also have been done in the coaxial @xcite and waveguide @xcite geometries .",
    "these techniques have mainly been used to map metallic conductivity or sheet resistance , and dielectric constant . in some cases",
    "the measurements are done quantitatively .",
    "[ fig1](c ) shows schematically one of the most sensitive forms of near - field microwave microscopy .",
    "the idea is that the sample is put near the open end of a transmission - line resonator , and changes in the resonant frequency and quality factor are monitored as the sample is scanned .",
    "this class of techniques differs from that shown in  fig . [ fig1](a ) through the use of a `` field enhancing '' feature at the end of the transmission line , rather than an evanescent aperture in the resonator .",
    "the field - enhancing feature sets the scale for the spatial resolution of this class of microscopes .",
    "the first embodiment of this concept was conceived for measuring the moisture content of paper @xcite .",
    "other embodiments use coaxial transmission lines with the sample in contact with the open end @xcite , or with an air gap between the probe and the sample @xcite .",
    "a related far - field technique has been used to image surface resistance and nonlinearity with a scanned dielectric resonator in contact with the sample @xcite .",
    "the resonant transmission - line technique has proven to be the most quantitative of all the near - field microwave microscopy methods .",
    "quantitative imaging of topography , sheet resistance , dielectric constant and loss , and other quantities has been achieved .",
    "in addition , the use of field enhancing features has pushed the spatial resolution of resonant and non - resonant microscopes to the sub-@xmath3 m domain while maintaining the quantitative nature of the measurements .",
    "the last two classes of near - field microscopy techniques are less developed , but show great promise for the future .",
    "[ fig1](d ) shows a cantilever with a sharp tip positioned over the sample .",
    "this geometry can be used to perform atomic force microscopy to determine the topography of the sample , in addition to microwave microscopy .",
    "there are three sub - classes of scanning probe measurements of materials properties at microwave frequencies .",
    "the first is to perform localized electron - spin resonance measurements @xcite .",
    "the tip is used for stm , and a magnetic field is applied to the sample .",
    "it is found that a local signal at the larmor precession frequency can be extracted from the tip and converted into an image of esr response of the sample .",
    "a second embodiment is to create a magnetic field gradient on the sample ( e.g. , with a small magnetic particle on the tip ) while immersing it in an rf magnetic field .",
    "the sample will locally satisfy the magnetic resonance condition and exert a force on the cantilever @xcite .",
    "a third scanning probe method is to simply use a sharp metallized tip to perform `` apertureless '' near - field microscopy .",
    "the sharp tip in close proximity to a metallic sample will locally enhance radiation introduced by a focused far - field beam . if an additional phenomenon can take place in this localized region due to the enhanced field strength , and it can be detected , one has a local microscopic probe of the physics associated with that phenomenon .",
    "one important example of this kind of microscopy is apertureless infrared microscopy , where the reflected signal from the region of the probe tip is measured while the tip is periodically dithered up and down @xcite .",
    "[ fig1](e ) shows the scanning superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) method of microwave microscopy .",
    "the squid will generate circulating rf currents when a dc bias is placed across the loop .",
    "the frequency of these currents is directly proportional to the applied bias voltage .",
    "the currents generate rf magnetic fields which then impinge on the sample .",
    "the sample will generate its own response currents which in turn modify the inductance of the squid loop . by monitoring the magnetic - field feedback signal required to keep the squid in a constant flux state",
    ", one can map the electromagnetic response of the sample @xcite .",
    "this method has the advantage of being very broadband ( in principle from rf up to the gap frequency of the superconductor used to make the squid , @xmath5100 ghz or more ) and quantitative .",
    "our group has developed a novel form of near - field scanning microwave microscopy based on the scanned resonator technique ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ umdmicroscopefig ] , our microscope consists of a resonant coaxial cable which is weakly coupled to a microwave generator on one end through a decoupling capacitor c@xmath6 , and coupled to a sample through an open - ended coaxial probe on the other end . in the absence of a sample ,",
    "the microscope is a half - wave resonator ( fig .",
    "[ openshortfig ] ) .",
    "as a metallic sample approaches the open end of the coaxial probe , the boundary condition there goes progressively from open circuit to short circuit ( e.g. , for the blunt probe shown in fig .",
    "[ probetipsfig](a ) ) . in the limit of the sample touching the coaxial probe , the microscope becomes a quarter - wave resonator ( fig .",
    "[ openshortfig ] ) . in the process , the resonant frequency shifts by one half the spacing between neighboring modes , which is on the order of 100 mhz .",
    "hence the microscope frequency shift is very sensitive to the probe / sample separation , as well as the electrical properties of the sample ( i.e. , the conductivity , dielectric constant and magnetic permeability ) .",
    "consider again the limit of the sample very far from the probe . in this case",
    "the quality factor of the resonator , q , is high since only internal dissipation processes ( and radiation losses ) are active .",
    "as the sample approaches the open end of the coaxial probe it must be considered part of the resonant circuit .",
    "as such , it will add losses to the system and in general reduce the q of the microscope .",
    "the q thus gives insight into the additional loss mechanisms introduced by the sample .",
    "as the sample is scanned beneath the probe , the probe - sample separation will vary ( depending upon the topography of the sample ) , causing the capacitive coupling to the sample , c@xmath7 , to vary .",
    "this has the result of changing the resonant frequency of the coaxial - cable resonator .",
    "also , as the local electrical properties of the sample vary , so will the resonant frequency and quality factor , q , of the resonant cable .",
    "the goal then is to turn the measured quantities @xmath4f and q versus position over the sample into quantitative images of sample electrical properties .",
    "a circuit is used to force the microwave generator to follow a single resonant mode of the cable , and a second circuit is used to measure the q of the circuit , both in real time ( fig .",
    "[ umdmicroscopefig ] ) @xcite .",
    "the microwave source is frequency modulated by an external oscillator at a rate @xmath8 3 khz .",
    "the electric field at the probe tip is perturbed by the region of the sample beneath the probe s center conductor .",
    "we monitor these perturbations using a diode detector which produces a voltage signal proportional to the power reflected from the resonator . a feedback circuit @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ umdmicroscopefig ] ) keeps the microwave source locked to a resonant frequency of the transmission line , and has a voltage output which is proportional to shifts in the resonant frequency due to the sample .",
    "hence , as the sample is scanned below the open - ended coaxial probe , the frequency shift and q signals are collected by a computer .",
    "the circuit runs quickly enough to accurately record at scan speeds of up to 25 mm / sec .    to determine the quality factor q of the resonant circuit , a lock - in amplifier , referenced at @xmath9 , gives an output voltage @xmath10 which is related to the curvature of the reflected power vs. frequency curve on resonance , and hence to q. to relate @xmath10 and q , we perform a separate experiment , in which we vary q using a microwave absorber at various heights below the probe tip , and measure the absolute reflection coefficient @xmath11 of the resonator . if @xmath12 is the reflection coefficient at a resonant frequency @xmath13 , then the coupling coefficient between the source and the resonator is @xmath14 the loaded quality factor of the resonator @xcite is q@xmath15 @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the difference in frequency between the two points where @xmath18 @xmath19",
    ". the unloaded quality factor , which is the q of the resonator without coupling to the microwave source and detector , is then q@xmath20 q@xmath21 .",
    "we also measure @xmath22 , and find that there is a unique functional relationship between q@xmath23 and @xmath10 ; thus , we need to calibrate this relationship only once for a given microscope resonance . in a typical scan , we record @xmath10 , and",
    "afterward convert @xmath10 to q@xmath23 .",
    "the spatial resolution of the microscope has been demonstrated to be the larger of the probe - sample separation and the diameter of the inner conductor wire in the open - ended coaxial cable @xcite . as with other forms of near - field microscopy",
    ", the probe is placed well within one wavelength of the sample under study .",
    "this is particularly easy to accomplish at rf , microwave and millimeter - wave frequencies because the wavelength ranges from meters to millimeters .",
    "however , the high spatial resolution comes from a `` field - enhancement '' feature of the probe .",
    "it has been found that sharp tips produce higher spatial resolution than blunt probes .",
    "figure [ probetipsfig ] contrasts these two types of probes in a transmission - line microscope , like those shown in fig . [ fig1](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "figure [ probetipsfig](a ) shows a blunt electric field probe , while fig .",
    "[ probetipsfig](b ) shows an stm - tipped probe .",
    "the blunt probe has a spatial resolution given by the area of the center conductor when operated in non - contact mode at a height smaller than the inner conductor diameter .",
    "the stm tip has a spatial resolution in contact mode on the order of 1 @xmath3 m , depending somewhat on the bluntness of the tip .",
    "the `` lightning - rod effect '' is responsible for the increased spatial resolution with a sharp - tip probe .",
    "this same principle is used in apertureless near - field scanning optical microscopy .",
    "the basic idea is that the electromagnetic fields in the near - field environment can be treated in the static approximation . in electrostatic equilibrium",
    "there will be a large electric field at sharp corners , with the local field being inversely proportional to the radius of curvature .",
    "this enhancement means that the response of the sample immediately below the sharp tip will dominate the signal .",
    "quantitative calculations of dielectric response from an stm - tipped probe bear out this qualitative picture @xcite .",
    "in addition to achieving high spatial resolution it also is important to vary the spatial resolution while maintaining quantitative measurement capability .",
    "there are times when a gross characterization or measurement of a sample property is required , for instance on the scale of a wafer or thin - film .",
    "there are physical property features on many length scales in materials .",
    "hence , a microscope must adapt itself to imaging all of these scales .",
    "our microscope is well adapted for this purpose and has been used with spatial resolutions of 500 @xmath3 m , 200 @xmath3 m , 100 @xmath3 m , 12 @xmath3 m and 1 @xmath3 m .",
    "an evanescent wave is one which does not propagate , but is exponentially attenuated with distance .",
    "such behavior can be created with microwaves in a variety of situations .",
    "the simplest is to use a single - conductor cylindrical wave guide and to reduce its lateral dimensions such that the cutoff frequency is made greater than the frequency of the propagating mode .",
    "the wave is then attenuated on the length scale of the diameter of the waveguide @xcite .",
    "this is the method employed by the microscopes in fig . [",
    ". the attractive feature of evanescence is the fact that the wave equation for the electromagnetic fields reduces to laplace s equation in regions small compared to the wavelength of the radiation .",
    "this allows one to use low - frequency analysis to understand the distribution of the fields in the evanescent near - field region .",
    "evanescence through an aperture brings with it several distinct disadvantages .",
    "first , evanescent waveguides are characterized by a purely reactive impedance @xcite , hence they reflect signals back to the source very efficiently .",
    "this leads to the problem of a very poor signal - to - noise ratio , as is encountered in traditional nsom through tapered optical fibers .",
    "the near - field optical community is now moving towards the `` apertureless nsom '' method in which no evanescent waves are used .",
    "instead they rely on a field - concentrating feature to enhance the signal from a very localized part of the sample .",
    "this is similar to the methods which we employ in our microscopes .",
    "another disadvantage of evanescence through an apeture at microwave frequencies is the long length scale of the evanescent decay .",
    "evanescence is of great utility in scanning tunneling microscopy because the decay length is so short that it permits atomic resolution imaging .",
    "however , for radiation coming out of a hole beyond cutoff , the decay length scale is on the order of the hole diameter .",
    "this can be made no smaller than a few hundred microns in practical microwave microscopes without reducing the signal - to - noise ratio to unity .",
    "however , techniques of field enhancement can improve the spatial resolution to much smaller values without compromising the signal - to - noise . here",
    "it may be that short - length - scale evanescent waves associated with the field enhancement feature may dramatically improve the spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "these evanescent waves are commonly encountered at the boundary between two different waveguides @xcite .",
    "the details of how these evanescent waves contribute to the imaging of electromagnetic properties on short length scales remain to be determined .",
    "the microwave microscope generates contrast for many different electromagnetic properties of materials .",
    "these include topography , conductivity , dielectric constant and magnetic permeability .",
    "in addition , other properties such as ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic resonance produce contrast for the microscope .    in order to quantitatively extract this information from the microscope images ,",
    "it is necessary to model the microscope and its interaction with the sample . here",
    "we begin with a model of our microscope , and defer the discussion of sample - specific modeling to the next section .",
    "the heart of the microscope is the microwave resonator ( fig .",
    "[ modelfig ] ) .",
    "it is coupled to the generator by the capacitor c@xmath6 and to the sample through the capacitor c@xmath7 ( in the case of an electric - field probe ) .",
    "the sample can be modeled as an impedance z@xmath7 which includes resistive , capacitive and inductive loads which it presents to the microscope .",
    "also included in the model are the directional coupler and detector which are used to measure the reflected signal from the resonator .",
    "one can calculate the signal measured in the detector v@xmath24 in terms of the source driving voltage , v@xmath25 .",
    "in the simplest case , one finds the following expression for the reflectivity of the resonator :    @xmath26    where z@xmath27 z@xmath23 is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line , p is the directional coupler voltage fraction , z@xmath6 = 1/@xmath28 , @xmath29 is the complex propagation constant of the transmission line of length l , and z@xmath7 is the impedance of the capacitor c@xmath7 in series with the sample .",
    "the presence of the sample modifies the resonance of the microscope in several ways .",
    "first , as the probe - sample distance varies , so does the capacitance c@xmath7 . consider a metallic sample below a blunt probe ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ probetipsfig](a ) ) .",
    "if the sample is much closer than the probe diameter , there is a parallel - plate capacitance between the probe and the sample .",
    "as the sample approaches the probe , this capacitance will increase , and the resonant frequency will decrease .",
    "this is because the increased capacitance at the end of the transmission line will effectively lengthen the resonator .",
    "ultimately as the sample comes into contact with the probe , a short - circuit condition is achieved and the microscope becomes a quarter - wave resonator .",
    "hence , the greatest frequency shift expected is that from converting a half - wave to a quarter - wave resonator , which is half the distance between neighboring modes in either the open circuit or short - circuit microscope .",
    "because the microscope is a transmission - line resonator with many closely spaced modes , and because each mode can be used for imaging , the microscope is a tremendously broadband instrument . in a typical design , the transmission - line resonator has a length of approximately 1 m , giving a fundamental mode at about 125 mhz , and harmonic modes at integer multiples of this frequency .",
    "hence , imaging can be done up to frequencies where higher - order modes begin to propagate in the coaxial cable , which can be over 100 ghz for small diameter cable .",
    "the only other limitation is the microwave electronics required to operate the microscope , such as the source , directional coupler , detector and connectors .",
    "however , using modern sources , electronics and the 1-mm standard connector , a 100 + ghz imaging bandwidth can be achieved .",
    "our microscopes work well at room temperature .",
    "however , we also have constructed a cryogenic version of the microwave microscope . in this case only the probe and part of the resonator is actually held at cryogenic temperatures , along with the sample .",
    "many images have been acquired at liquid - nitrogen temperature ( 77 k ) in both materials and device - imaging modes @xcite .",
    "we see no reason why this can not be extended to pumped helium temperatures ( 1.2 k ) . at the other extreme ,",
    "high - temperature coaxial cables exist which can be used for imaging up to 1000@xmath30c @xcite .",
    "one can imagine introducing other quantities into the sample during microwave microscopy .",
    "for instance , light illumination is an obvious degree of freedom .",
    "we have found that measurements of tunability are very interesting with the scanning near - field microwave microscope . in this case",
    "the use of external electric and magnetic fields is most important .",
    "we have developed a technique to introduce a local and tunable electric field in our microwave microscope when imaging in contact mode ( fig .",
    "[ umdmicroscopefig ] ) .",
    "a dc electric bias voltage can be applied to the center conductor of the microwave probe through a bias tee .",
    "this will create an electric field between the probe tip and the surrounding grounded surfaces . by introducing a suitable ground plane , controlled electric fields",
    "can be applied to the sample being imaged at microwave frequencies @xcite .",
    "we also can introduce a static magnetic field on samples being imaged by the microwave microscope using an electromagnet .",
    "the field can be modulated for imaging magnetic resonant phenomena in the sample .",
    "here we present some of the results on quantitative imaging with our microscope .",
    "very simply , one expects lossy properties of the sample shown in the model of fig .",
    "[ modelfig ] to affect the q of the microscope , while reactive properties and topography will primarily affect the resonant frequency .",
    "images obtained from resonant near - field scanning microwave microscopes are the result of two distinct contrast mechanisms : shifts in the resonant frequency due to electrical coupling between the probe and the sample , and changes in the quality factor q of the resonator due to losses in the sample @xcite .",
    "such images will inevitably contain intrinsic information about a sample ( such as dielectric constant or surface resistance ) as well as extrinsic information ( such as surface topography ) . to facilitate quantitative imaging of intrinsic material properties , it is essential to be able to accurately account for the effects of finite probe - sample separation and topography .",
    "the interaction between the probe and a metallic sample can be represented by a capacitance c@xmath7 between the sample and the inner conductor of the probe , analogous to the mechanism in scanning capacitance microscopy @xcite . for a highly conducting sample and a small probe - sample capacitance c@xmath7 , i.e. , c@xmath7 @xmath31 l / cz@xmath23 ,",
    "the reflected voltage v@xmath32 at the output of the directional coupler can be written as above in eq .",
    "( [ vdrc eq ] ) with @xmath33 } { \\sinh \\left ( \\gamma l\\right ) + i\\omega c_xz_0\\cosh \\left ( \\gamma l\\right ) } , $ ] where c is the speed of light , and @xmath34 is the angular frequency of the source . a plot of eq .",
