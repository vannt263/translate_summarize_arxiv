    "the discovery of double degenerate binary systems is crucial to our attempt at better constraining their origin and evolution . in particular ,",
    "these binary systems are thought to be the progenitors of type ia supernovae if the total mass of the two components exceeds the chandrasekhar limit and if their orbital period is small enough to allow them to merge within a hubble time .",
    "however , only a small percentage of double degenerate binaries lead to supernova explosions according to @xcite and @xcite . in 2006 , only ten such binaries composed of two white dwarfs were known @xcite . since then , the spy ( eso supernovae ia progenitor survey ) radial velocity survey has observed more than 1000 white dwarfs and pre - white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "one of the conclusions of that survey is that double degenerate binaries can not explain the existence of every low mass white dwarf ( 0.45 @xmath4  or less ) .",
    "indeed , only 42@xmath5 of low - mass he - core white dwarfs are found in close binary systems .",
    "double degenerate binaries are difficult to detect from single slit spectroscopy alone .",
    "this is particularly true for system composed of two da stars since the composite spectrum can be reproduced almost perfectly with a single hydrogen - rich model atmosphere @xcite . in order to detect such spectroscopically invisible da+da systems ,",
    "@xcite compared effective temperatures determined from optical and ultraviolet ( iue ) spectra , and identified three candidate systems .",
    "double degenerate systems composed of white dwarfs with different spectral types are easier to detect , however , since the modeling of these objects under the assumption of a single star leads to spurious results .",
    "this is precisely how @xcite showed that the dab pg 1115@xmath6166  was in fact a double degenerate binary system composed of a da and a db star .",
    "their analysis revealed that the optical spectrum could not be reproduced with a single model atmosphere with a mixed hydrogen and helium composition , or even a stratified chemical composition .",
    "instead , the authors showed that a combination of a da and a db model spectrum could perfectly match the observed line profiles and photometry .",
    "additional objects are also discussed in @xcite and references therein .",
    "pg 1115@xmath6166  was first identified in the pg catalog @xcite as a da5 .",
    "later , @xcite confirmed the binary nature of pg 1115@xmath6166  and obtained an orbital period of 30.09 days , too long to allow the white dwarfs to merge within a hubble time .",
    "the binary models of @xcite explained that the older nature of the db star in pg 1115@xmath6166  is the result of the loss of its hydrogen - rich outer layers after it has evolved into a giant phase .",
    "we are currently conducting a spectroscopic survey of all the white dwarfs discovered in the kiso ultraviolet ( kuv ) survey with the aim of redetermining the luminosity function using the spectroscopic method of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also liebert et al .",
    "one of these white dwarfs , kuv 02196 + 2816  ( wd  0219@xmath6282 , @xmath7 ) was spectroscopically identified as a dba star by @xcite .",
    "however , this object should have been classified as a dab star since the hydrogen lines are actually stronger than the helium lines ( see   2 below ) . dab white dwarfs are particularly interesting since they may represent the key to our understanding of the evolution of dao and hot db stars , and of the existence of a strong deficiency of db stars between 30,000 and 45,000  k ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "we report in this paper the discovery that kuv 02196 + 2816  is actually a double degenerate binary composed of a da and a db star .",
    "an analysis identical to that of pg 1115@xmath6166  by @xcite indeed reveals that the spectrum of kuv 02196 + 2816  can not be reproduced by a single star model , and that a composite da and db model spectrum provides a much better fit to the observations .",
    "we first present our spectroscopic observations in   2 .",
    "the model atmosphere calculations described in   3 are then used in   4 to analyze in detail the optical spectrum of kuv 02196 + 2816  using homogeneous as well as composite model atmospheres .",
    "our discussion follows in   5 .",
    "166 , and mct 0453@xmath82933 .",
    "the last two objects have been interpreted by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , as unresolved composite systems consisting of a da white dwarf and a db or dba companion .",
    "the spectra are normalized at 4400   and are shifted vertically by 0.5 for clarity.[f1 ] ]    optical spectroscopy for kuv 02196 + 2816  has been obtained on 2007 december 6 using the steward observatory 2.3-m telescope equipped with the boller & chivens spectrograph and a loral ccd detector .",
    "the @xmath9 slit together with the 600 line mm@xmath10 grating in first order provided a spectral coverage of 32005300   at an intermediate resolution of @xmath11    fwhm .",
    "our optical spectrum for kuv 02196 + 2816  is displayed in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "the hydrogen balmer lines are clearly stronger than the helium lines and the star should thus be classified as a dab white dwarf . the spectrum of kuv 02196 + 2816  is also compared with gd 323 , the prototype of the dab class @xcite , pg 1115@xmath6166  @xcite , and mct 0453@xmath82933 @xcite .",
    "pg 1115@xmath6166  has already been discussed above while mct 0453@xmath82933 has been analyzed by @xcite and was shown to be an unresolved composite system consisting of a da white dwarf together with a db or a dba star . from repeated spectroscopic observations at h@xmath12 as part of the spy survey , @xcite found variations of the line core shapes . in one of the spectra",
    ", they noticed a splitting at h@xmath12 ( see also fig",
    ".  7 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that both stars in the binary system contain considerable amounts of hydrogen . it was concluded that mct 0453@xmath82933 is composed of a da and a dba , or even a dab star .",
    "the similarity between mct 0453@xmath82933 and pg 1115@xmath6166  has already been discussed in @xcite , where the double degenerate binary nature of pg 1115@xmath6166  was unveiled .",
    "the spectrum of kuv 02196 + 2816  shows the same he  i features as these two stars : the 4026 and 4471   absorption lines are about the same strength as those of pg 1115@xmath6166 while the features at 4713 , 4921 and 5015   are only slightly stronger .",
    "the hydrogen balmer lines are definitely weaker in the spectrum of kuv 02196 + 2816  than in pg 1115@xmath6166 , however , and more typical of the strength observed in gd 323 .",
    "the model atmospheres and synthetic spectra for da stars are described at length in @xcite and references therein . the models for db and dba stars used in this analysis rely on a modified version of our model atmosphere code for da stars in which we have included all the helium opacity sources from the db model atmosphere code described in @xcite , and in particular the improved stark profiles of neutral helium of @xcite .",
    "the mixed hydrogen and helium models assume a homogeneous chemical composition .",
    "we refrain here from using stratified models since @xcite demonstrated that such models could not improve the fit to the optical spectrum of pg 1115@xmath6166  with respect to homogeneous models . also , because the hydrogen and helium lines in the spectrum of kuv 02196 + 2816  are almost of equal strength , dba models with unusually high helium abundances had to be calculated for this analysis .",
    "our dba model grid covers a range of @xmath13  k , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , where the numbers in parentheses indicate the step value .",
    "pure helium models were calculated as well .",
    "our fitting technique relies on the nonlinear least - squares method of levenberg - marquardt @xcite , which is based on a steepest descent method .",
    "the model spectra ( convolved with a gaussian instrumental profile ) and the optical spectrum of kuv 02196 + 2816  are first normalized to a continuum set to unity .",
    "the calculation of @xmath16 is then carried out in terms of these normalized line profiles only . all atmospheric parameters ",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19  are considered free parameters . when fitting da+db model spectra , the total flux of the system is obtained from the sum of the monochromatic eddington fluxes of the individual components , weighted by their respective radius .",
    "the stellar radii are obtained from evolutionary models similar to those described in @xcite but with c / o cores , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which are representative of hydrogen - atmosphere white dwarfs , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which are representative of helium - atmosphere white dwarfs .",
    "our best fits to the optical spectrum of kuv 02196 + 2816  using homogeneous and composite da+db models are shown in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "the solution using homogeneous models depicts the same problem as that mentioned in @xcite with the fit to pg 1115@xmath6166 : the he  ii @xmath244686 feature predicted by our models is not observed in the spectrum of kuv 02196 + 2816 .",
    "we note , however , that @xcite did not encounter this problem while fitting the spectrum of pg 1115@xmath6166 , even though this particular line was included in their model calculations .",
    "our homogeneous solution for kuv 02196 + 2816  is @xmath25  k hotter and @xmath26 dex lower in @xmath18 than that obtained for pg 1115@xmath6166 , but more importantly , the helium abundance is about a factor of 40 larger , and our solution predicts a weak but detectable he  ii absorption feature that is simply not observed .",
    "we also see in figure [ f2 ] that the low hydrogen balmer lines ( h@xmath27 to h@xmath28 ) are predicted too strong while the higher members are too weak .",
    "the homogeneous model yields a satisfactory fit for the he  i lines @xmath294026 , 4713 , and 5015 , but a poor fit to the remaining helium lines .    ]    .",
    "the thin lines show the individual contributions of the da and db components , properly weighted by their respective radius , while the thick line corresponds to the total monochromatic flux of the composite system.[f3 ] ]    our grid of model atmospheres with mixed h / he compositions has already been applied successfully to fit db and dba stars @xcite or hotter dao stars @xcite .",
    "hence the bad fit displayed at the top of figure [ f2 ] does not reflect the inability of our models to fit this star .",
    "we also note that @xcite have obtained good fits to db stars found in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) with temperatures similar to that of kuv 02196 + 2816  ( @xmath30  k ) , although none of these hot db stars had hydrogen abundances as high as that inferred here ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "even if we ignore the bad quality of the fit depicted at the top of figure [ f2 ] , the atmospheric parameters we obtain for kuv 02196 + 2816  based on homogeneous models represent a problem from an astrophysical point of view .",
    "indeed , the typical hydrogen abundances measured by @xcite in dba stars from the spy survey are of the order of @xmath32 to @xmath33 ( see their table 2 )  or even @xmath34 in some extreme cases  , and most of them have effective temperatures well below 30,000  k. similarly , the helium abundances measured in typical dao and dab stars range from @xmath35 to 0.1 ( see fig",
    ".  7 of * ? ? ?",
    "it is thus difficult to reconcile the atmospheric composition determined here for kuv 02196 + 2816  using homogeneous models with other single dab / dao or dba white dwarfs .",
    "in contrast with the homogeneous solution , our da+db solution shown at the bottom of figure [ f2 ] provides an excellent fit to the balmer and neutral helium lines simultaneously .",
    "our da+db fit yields a @xmath36 value of 0.543 , a value that is significantly lower than that obtained for the homogeneous solution , @xmath37 .",
    "all observed features are reproduced in detail and this is clearly a much better solution for kuv 02196 + 2816 .",
    "the effective temperature determined for the da component is significantly lower than the value achieved under the assumption of a single object with a homogeneous composition .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the hydrogen lines being diluted by the continuum flux of the db star ( see below ) ; the balmer lines are weakened , and the effective temperature of the model needs to be increased to match the observed line profiles .",
    "the effective temperature of the db component , @xmath2  k , is higher than the value obtained with our homogeneous models , @xmath30  k , yet the he  ii @xmath244686 feature only appears as a small depression in the blue wing of he  i @xmath244713 . again in this case , the presence of the da star dilutes all the helium lines present in the db spectrum .",
    "but the main physical reason for this difference in strength is that the overall opacity of the mixed h / he model is lower than that of the pure helium model at the same effective temperature , resulting in lower atmospheric pressures , which in turn favors the ionization of helium in the mixed atmosphere .",
    "hence the he  ii @xmath244686 feature appears stronger in the mixed model than in the pure helium model , even though the former is @xmath38  k cooler .",
    "the surface gravities of both components of the system are almost identical , @xmath39 for the da and @xmath40 for the db .",
    "these values can be translated into masses and cooling ages using the evolutionary models described above .",
    "we obtain respectively for the da and the db star 0.69 and 0.68 @xmath4 , and cooling ages of @xmath41 and @xmath42 years .",
    "since both stars have the same radius , the contribution of each component to the total luminosity is only a function of the effective temperature .",
    "since the db star is significantly hotter than the da component , the former will contribute more to the combined luminosity of the system .",
    "this is illustrated quantitatively in figure [ f3 ] where the contribution of each component to the total flux is depicted .",
    "there is a significant contribution of the flux of the db star in the optical regions of the energy distribution . in particular , the cores of the lower balmer lines are filled in by the continuum flux of the db star , resulting in the poor fits of the homogeneous solution displayed in figure [ f2 ] and discussed above .",
    "our analysis has shown that the simultaneous presence of hydrogen and helium in the spectrum of kuv 02196 + 2816  is better explained in terms of an unresolved binary system composed of a da white dwarf and a db star .",
    "we note that in at least two instances , pg 1115@xmath6166  and mct 0453@xmath82933 ( displayed in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] and discussed above ) , this binary interpretation has been confirmed through spectral velocity variations , hence similar observations of kuv 02196 + 2816  should also confirm its binary nature . despite the evidence of our spectroscopic analysis",
    ", we discuss in the following the difficulty with interpreting kuv 02196 + 2816  as a single star , even from an evolutionary point of view .",
    "there are actually two scenarios that can produce mixed hydrogen and helium atmospheres in the temperature range considered here .",
    "the first scenario , discussed in the context of dba stars , is the accretion of hydrogen from the interstellar medium onto a helium - dominated atmosphere .",
    "however , the stellar wind model proposed by @xcite might prevent the accretion of hydrogen for stars hotter than @xmath43  k. hence , the presence of hydrogen in kuv 02196 + 2816  can not be explained by this scenario , and another explanation must be sought for the existence of kuv 02196 + 2816  if it is to be interpreted as a single star .",
    "another scenario has been proposed by @xcite , where residual amounts of hydrogen left in the envelope of hot do stars would gradually diffuse to the surface as the white dwarf evolves along the cooling sequence .",
    "this build up of hydrogen at the photosphere would gradually turn do white dwarfs into da stars . prior to the sdss ,",
    "the absence of any helium - rich atmosphere white dwarfs below @xmath44  k ( and above 30,000  k ) would impose a limit of @xmath45  @xmath4  to the total mass of hydrogen left after the post - agb phase .",
    "such minute amounts of hydrogen are actually sufficient to turn _ all _ hot , helium - rich atmosphere white dwarfs into da stars by the time they reach @xmath44  k , which defines the blue edge of the so - called `` db gap '' , a range in effective temperature between @xmath46 and 45,000  k where no helium atmosphere white dwarf ( do or db stars ) had ever been identified @xcite .",
    "more recently , however , the sdss has revealed the existence of several hot db stars in this gap @xcite , although the fraction of helium - dominated atmospheres in this temperature range remains significantly lower than that found at higher or lower temperatures .",
    "we note that sdss white dwarfs are much fainter than those investigated by @xcite in the palomar - green sample .",
    "the implication of this result is that a few white dwarfs must necessarily survive the do to da transition at high temperatures .",
    "this in turn implies that the amount of hydrogen left in the envelope of pre - white dwarfs during the post - agb phase is even smaller than previously anticipated .",
    "we must conclude that the born - again post - agb scenario proposed by @xcite in which a violent mixing event is induced by a late helium flash in the post - agb phase is efficient enough to leave virtually no hydrogen behind .",
    "the recent discovery by @xcite of a new class of white dwarf stars with carbon - rich atmospheres between @xmath47 and 24,000  k even suggests that these flash events might be efficient enough to leave no helium behind ! in this context , it is perhaps no longer surprising to find hot db stars in the gap .",
    "these hot db stars are most likely the immediate progenitors of the carbon - rich atmosphere white dwarfs discovered by dufour et al .",
    "the significant increase in the number of helium - atmosphere db white dwarfs below @xmath46  k  whether in the pg or sdss samples  can only be explained in terms of the convective dilution of the superficial hydrogen atmosphere by the underlying helium convective envelope , provided that the hydrogen layer is sufficiently thin ( @xmath48 , * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed by @xcite , if the do - to - da and da - to - db transition scenarios discussed above are correct , white dwarfs with mixed hydrogen and helium compositions must be sought either at the hot end of the db gap ( or deficit ) near 45,000  k where an extremely thin hydrogen atmosphere in diffusive equilibrium on top of the helium envelope would make the star appear as a dao star , or near the cool end of the gap , where convective dilution of the thin hydrogen atmosphere occurs .",
    "excellent candidates of such stars caught in the act of changing from one spectral type to another are pg 1305@xmath8017 , a dao star at @xmath49  k whose spectrum is better reproduced with stratified atmospheres @xcite , and gd 323 ( shown in fig .  1 ) , a dab star at @xmath50  k @xcite whose spectrum exhibits spectroscopic variations that have been interpreted as surface abundance inhomogeneities resulting from the convective dilution of hydrogen into helium @xcite .",
    "going back to kuv 02196 + 2816 , its effective temperature near 35,000 k obtained under the assumption of homogeneous single - star models does not fit well into this picture .",
    "first , the convective efficiency of the helium envelope at that temperature ( the he  ii convection zone in this case ) is much too low to produce any dilution of the hydrogen superficial atmosphere . and second",
    ", since kuv 02196 + 2816  is a full 10,000  k cooler than the blue edge of the db gap near 45,000  k , it has necessarily survived the do - to - da transition .",
    "this in turn implies that the _ total _ amount of hydrogen left in the envelope during the post - agb phase must be extremely small , and certainly too small to account for the hydrogen abundance inferred from our homogeneous model atmosphere analysis .",
    "thus , the da+db solution proposed here for kuv 02196 + 2816  not only provides a much better fit to the optical spectrum than the single star model , but it also represents the only viable solution from an evolutionary point of view .",
    "interestingly enough , the effective temperature we infer for the db component of the system , @xmath2  k , puts it right in the middle of the db gap .",
    "this makes the db component of the kuv 02196 + 2816  system the brightest db white dwarf ever identified in the gap . from the atmospheric parameters of the da and db stars",
    ", we estimate the absolute visual magnitude of the system at @xmath51 , which combined with the visual magnitude of @xmath7 yields a distance of 360 pc .",
    "@xcite also found from the 2mass photometry that kuv 02196 + 2816  was a good binary candidate composed of a white dwarf and a low - mass main - sequence star .",
    "this binary nature was confirmed by @xcite in their study of white dwarf - red dwarf systems resolved with hst .",
    "farihi et al .",
    "indeed found that kuv 02196 + 2816  has a red dwarf companion and both stars are believed to be gravitationally bound . since kuv 02196 + 2816  itself is a double degenerate binary , the system is thus composed of three stars , two of which are unresolved . as mentioned above , high - resolution spectroscopic observations similar to that obtained by @xcite for the double degenerate system mct 0453@xmath82933 could help confirm our binary interpretation .",
    "finally , we note that since the total mass of the kuv 02196 + 2816  system ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) is close to the chandrasekhar limit , a precise measurement of its orbital period would establish whether kuv 02196 + 2816  represents a likely supernova candidate .",

    "we would also like to thank a. gianninas for a careful reading of this manuscript .",
