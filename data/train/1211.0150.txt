    "@xcite such manipulations would have direct impact on the intra- and intervalley wave packet dynamics discussed here .",
    "the simulation results also make explicit the dependence of the trajectory shifts on the wave packet size and the effective mass ( i.e. the berry curvature distribution in momentum space ) . reducing the initial momentum space wave packet size ( @xmath64 ) can drastically enhance the trajectory shifts in both regimes .",
    "furthermore , for a fixed wave packet size , there is an optimum effective mass that maximizes the shifts of the outgoing trajectories and the widths of the bloch oscillation paths .",
    "experimentally , the trajectory shifts may be observed as scattering asymmetry at np junctions @xcite for either reflected or transmitted electrons , where a staggered sublattice potential may originate from an appropriate substrate material or , in the case of silicene and germanene , from an external perpendicular electric field .",
    "@xcite in the limit of a single spatially extended bloch state , berry curvature induced shifts become phase jumps at the step interface , which may be observed as anomalies in the conductance oscillations across a potential barrier due to interference between forward and backward reflected wave functions . @xcite these shifts may also substantially affect the electron focusing and lensing behaviour of potential barriers and potentials steps in electron optics applications . @xcite    it would further be interesting to investigate how the wave packet dynamics change for zigzag and klein edges .",
    "the dynamics at zigzag and klein edges are less symmetric about the interface normal than in the armchair case . for sharp steps this will affect the direction and",
    "the berry curvature induced shifts of the wave packet trajectories .",
    "the coupling of wave packets with edge states may give rise to further intriguing behavior at resonance energies .",
