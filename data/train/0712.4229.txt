    "while calculating evolutionary models of binary stars , we must take into account mass transfer and associated physical mechanism which lead to mass and angular momentum loss .",
    "we use a formula based on that used to calculate angular momentum loss via a stellar wind ( paczyski & zikowski 1967 ; zikowski 1985 and de greve 1993 ) .",
    "we can express the change in the total orbital angular momentum ( @xmath7 ) of a binary system as    @xmath8    where , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote , respectively , the mass of the primary , secondary and the total mass of the system , @xmath12 is the ratio of the mass ejected by the wind to that accreted by the primary component and @xmath13 is defined as the effectiveness of angular momentum loss during mass transfer ( sarna & de greve 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "models of secondary stars filling their roche lobes were computed using a standard stellar evolution code based on the henyey - type code of paczyski ( 1970 ) , which has been adapted to low - mass stars ( as described in detail in marks & sarna 1998 ) .",
