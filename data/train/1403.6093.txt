    "since the first discovery on momentum phenomena ( @xcite ) , price momentum , one of the most well - known market anomalies , has attracted attention from academia and industry . empirical evidence for the price momentum has been found in various asset classes and markets ( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the origin of the price momentum is still mysterious although diverse explanations and interpretations on the anomaly have been suggested .",
    "those approaches include lead - lag effect or auto-/cross - sectional correlation ( @xcite ) , over-/under - reaction of investors to the news ( @xcite ) , sector momentum ( @xcite ) , symmetry breaking of return parity ( @xcite ) and transaction cost ( @xcite ) . however , there is no integrated framework to explain the market anomaly yet .    the anomaly , that the future direction of a financial asset price is predictable with past price history , is also interesting to practitioners in finance who need to forecast asset prices and develop profitable trading strategies .",
    "when an asset price forms a trend , it tends to keep the trend , i.e. , past winners are likely to outperform past losers in the future . exploiting the prediction based on the momentum anomaly , it is obvious for investors , who want to implement the momentum strategy , to buy the past winners and short - sell the past losers .",
    "however , it is not easy to detect the price trends from noisy data in practice .",
    "moreover , the risk of losing money always exists if the naive strategy is implemented without any deep understanding in the source of the price momentum .    in these senses ,",
    "more profound analysis on the price momentum is indispensable and finding potential momentum factors is an important task to both academics and practitioners .",
    "one easy approach to demystifying the origins and seeking lucrative trading strategies is to implement momentum strategies using alternative stock selection rules which are potential momentum - driving factors .",
    "several factors considered in the literature are expected return by a time series model ( @xcite ) , trading volume ( @xcite ) , liquidity ( @xcite ) , 52-week high price ( @xcite ) , physical momentum ( @xcite ) , maximum drawdown and recovery ( @xcite ) and reward - risk measures ( @xcite ) .    among the papers on the alternative stock selection rules , @xcite focused on various reward - risk measures for momentum ranking criteria .",
    "their momentum portfolios were constructed from long positions on less riskier assets as winners and short positions on much riskier assets as losers . in the s&p 500 universe from 1996 to 2003 , these alternative portfolios achieved less risky performances than the traditional momentum strategy .",
    "additionally , it was found that the winner groups with better reward - risk measures in the past are subjected to lower ex - post risks than the loser groups .",
    "the conclusion in their paper is also consistent with the low volatility anomaly in @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the reward - risk measures - based approach suggested by @xcite to many different directions .",
    "first of all , reward - risk measure - based momentum portfolios are constructed in diverse asset classes including currency markets , commodity markets , global stock benchmark indices , south korea kospi 200 universe , spdr u.s .",
    "sector etfs and s&p 500 universe . secondly ,",
    "more robust tests by using a different time horizon and removing survivor bias with the consideration of the component - change history are performed in the s&p 500 universe .",
    "thirdly , the reward - risk measures are calculated from the arma - garch model with classical tempered stable innovations .",
    "finally , the carhart four - factor analysis on the reward - risk portfolios is conducted .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in next section ,",
    "we briefly cover a risk model and reward - risk measures used as stock selection rules for momentum - style portfolio construction . in section [ sec_risk_momentum_data_method ] , datasets and a methodology are introduced . performances and risk measures for the alternative strategies",
    "are given in section [ sec_risk_momentum_result ] .",
    "the carhart four - factor analysis is conducted in section [ sec_risk_momentum_factor_analysis ] .",
    "we conclude the paper in section [ sec_risk_momentum_conclusion ] .",
    "the sharpe ratio is the ratio of the expected excessive return to the standard deviation of excessive returns ( @xcite ) , i.e. , it is the reward per deviation .",
    "the sharpe ratio is defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a risk - free rate . a portfolio with a higher sharpe ratio",
    "is considered a better portfolio than a portfolio with a lower sharpe ratio .",
    "additionally , the portfolio with the highest sharpe ratio in the markowitz framework ( @xcite ) is the tangency portfolio .      in order to define conditional value - at - risk ( cvar ) , value - at - risk ( var ) needs to be introduced .",
    "the var of @xmath2 is defined as the loss such that the probability of exceeding this loss is @xmath3 .",
    "the var of @xmath2 is represented with @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "the cvar , also known as average value - at - risk ( avar ) , is the expected loss of a portfolio under a given var level ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cvar of @xmath2 is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath5 .",
    "when severe losses hit a given var level , cvar tells how seriously bad in average the losses are , i.e. , it is the average loss of the extreme losses within a given significance . for continuous distributions ,",
    "the cvar of @xmath2 is identical to the extreme tail loss ( etl ) of @xmath7 : @xmath8    an advantage of cvar over var is the coherency of the risk measure . the definition and properties of a coherent risk measure are given in the original literature on coherent risk measures ( @xcite ) .",
    "another benefit of using cvar is that cvar encodes much information on the downside tail .",
    "for example , even if the var levels of two different portfolios are same , a portfolio with a fatter downside tail exhibits a larger cvar value .",
    "the sharpe ratio considers deviations along both of downside and upside directions .",
    "since the deviation in the upward direction is not an actual risk , much attention on the downslide risk should be paid .",
    "the stable tail adjusted return ratio ( star - ratio ) was introduced by @xcite in order to distinguish the risk from the volatility . for the star - ratio , the standard deviation in the denominator of the sharpe ratio definition",
    "is replaced with cvar .",
    "the star - ratio is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath5 . since riskier assets have larger cvar values , the star - ratios of riskier assets become smaller . meanwhile , less risky assets exhibit larger star - ratios .",
    "the return distribution of a financial asset has two tails , one for downside and another for upside .",
    "it is obvious that the upper tail is favorable but the lower tail is undesirable .",
    "the rachev ratio ( r - ratio ) is the ratio of the expected upward tail gain to the expected downside tail loss ( @xcite ) .",
    "the r - ratio is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "a higher r - ratio is more preferred for portfolios construction and stock selection .",
    "the maximum drawdown is the worst consecutive loss of a portfolio in a given time horizon . given a period of @xmath12 , the maximum drawdown ( mdd )",
    "is defined as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the return between time @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "although the maximum drawdown is not used as a ranking criterion in this paper , it is calculated for risk assessment on momentum portfolios .",
    "these reward - risk measures for ranking criteria can be categorized into two classes .",
    "the first class includes ratio - based measures such as r - ratio , star - ratio and sharpe ratio . with the ratio measures ,",
    "a reward is scaled by a risk .",
    "pure risk measures are in the second class . through this paper ,",
    "cvar is the only measure in this category .",
    "it is important to decide a risk model for reward - risk measure calculation .",
    "considering distributional properties of a financial asset price such as autocorrelation and volatility clustering , the arma(1,1)-garch(1,1 ) model ( @xcite ) is chosen as the main model for time series .",
    "additionally , we assume that the innovations of the model are generated from classical tempered stable ( cts ) distribution ( @xcite ) in order to model asymmetry and fat - tails in empirical distributions .",
    "the arma - garch - cts model is proposed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and there exist several applications of the model to finance ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper follows the original literature .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath17 of @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 are all positive , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the gamma function . in the cts distribution",
    ", @xmath24 is the location parameter .",
    "the tail index @xmath25 tells how fat tails are and a small tail index means thicker tails in the distribution . the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the scale parameters of the distribution . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the decay rates of the upside and downside tails , respectively . similar to the tail index @xmath25 , a fatter downside ( upside ) tail",
    "is characterized by smaller @xmath30 @xmath31 .    according to @xcite , parameter estimation for the arma(1,1)-garch(1,1)-cts model is as follows .",
    "first of all , the parameters of the arma - garch model are estimated from the maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) under an assumption of student - t distributed residuals .",
    "after then the residuals of the arma - garch model are calculated based on the estimated arma - garch parameters . finally , the parameters of the cts distribution can be found from the residuals by using mle ( @xcite ) .",
    "the probability density function of the cts distribution is obtained from the characteristic function , eq .",
    "( [ cts_charac_ftn ] ) , by using fast - fourier transform . for a given sample",
    ", the parameters of the cts distribution can be found from mle .",
    "after all the parameters are estimated , the reward - risk measures are acquired from the model . expected returns and standard deviations obtained from the risk model",
    "are used for calculating sharpe ratio .",
    "the parameters are also plugged to the cvar formula for the arma - garch - cts model given in @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the arma parameters , @xmath34 is drawn from the cts distribution and @xmath35 is the standard deviation of @xmath34 . for the cts distribution",
    ", there exists the closed form expression for @xmath36 in @xcite . for a given cvar value ,",
    "it is straightforward to compute star - ratio and r - ratio .",
    "various asset classes and markets are employed in order to conduct robust tests on the profitability of reward - risk momentum strategies .",

    "the minimum length of the time series in the period for generating the summary data is 21 corresponding to the average total number of trading dates in one month .",
    "this ignorance is reasonable for the case that some equities , fx rates and commodities , that begin to be newly traded in the markets , could have too small numbers of data points during the periods to estimate the parameters of the arma - garch - cts model by using mle .    for the purpose of risk assessment , sharpe ratio , var , cvar , star - ratio and r - ratio of the alternative portfolios are calculated from the daily returns of the portfolios .",

    "according to table [ tbl_daily_summary_stat_risk_momentum_monthly_6_6_momentum_us_fx ] , the summary statistics of momentum strategies show that the r - ratio based strategies implemented in the currency universe outperform the traditional momentum strategy which obtains the monthly return of 0.34% and the standard deviation of 2.33% . in particular , the r - ratio(50% , 9x%)-based portfolios achieve monthly 0.440.52% .",

    "winner groups in the reward - risk portfolios have larger @xmath30 parameters than the cumulative return winner .",
    "it is evident that downside risks for the winner groups are lowered in the alternative portfolios .",
    "opposite to the long baskets , @xmath30 values for the loser baskets are smaller than the loser group in the cumulative return criterion and it is attractive for a loser basket to take larger downside risks to earn profits from short - selling the loser .",
    "many reward - risk measures select less riskier winner and loser groups with smaller 95% vars and cvars . in addition to that",
    ", the maximum drawdown of each basket is also reduced with respect to each long / short basket in the cumulative return criterion . moreover , comparable sizes of maximum drawdowns are obtained by the winner and loser groups in the r - ratio , star - ratio and sharpe ratio portfolios . meanwhile , for the cvar portfolios , maximum drawdowns of the winner groups are much smaller than those of the loser groups .",
    "this pattern is also observed in the cumulative return portfolio .      in various asset classes ,",
    "reward - risk measures are better ranking rules that select potential good- and bad - performers in next 6 months .",
    "in particular , better portfolio returns with lower volatility levels are acquired by the r - ratio(50% , 9x% ) measures .",
    "the outperformances of the r - ratio(50% , 9x% ) portfolios are also supported by the historical cumulative returns of the alternative portfolios given in fig .",
    "[ grp_acc_return_risk_momentum_monthly_6_6_momentum ] .",
    "it is easy to find that the r - ratio(50% , 9x% ) strategies not only outperform the traditional trend - following strategy but also tend to form more consistent trends with less fluctuations .",
    "additionally , the performances of the r - ratio(50% , 9x% ) strategies are still persistent even during the financial crisis in 2008 . similar to the r - ratio(50% , 9x% ) criteria , the star - ratios are also dominant in performance and risk management .",
    "the r - ratio(9x% , 9x% ) and sharpe ratio also provide portfolios with large average returns and the portfolios are less riskier than the benchmark momentum strategy in many asset classes .",
    "each long / short basket is also superior in performance to the corresponding basket in the benchmark momentum portfolio .",
    "the outperformances of the reward - risk momentum strategies are achieved not under taking more risks but with accepting less risks . in particular , the r - ratio(50% , 9x% ) portfolios are less riskier in various risk measures than the traditional momentum portfolio .",
    "dominance in the risk profiles is also found in the level of long / short baskets .",
    "although the star - ratio and the sharpe ratio portfolios are not as good in performance as the r - ratio portfolios , the risk profiles of the portfolios exhibit that the alternative strategies are also less riskier than the benchmark strategy .",
    "better expected returns with less risks are another evidence for the low volatility anomaly ( @xcite ) . although counterexamples to the anomaly are also reported ( @xcite ) , the methodologies used in those papers are not flawless enough to draw a contradiction to the low volatility anomaly .",
    "for example , @xcite used var as the selection criterion which is calculated from empirical distributions .",
    "the sample sizes for the empirical distributions range between 24 and 60 .",
    "however , the small - sized samples can affect volatility estimation which is more important in risk measure calculation ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite implemented the portfolios based on the tail index of idiosyncratic residuals in the carhart four - factor models ( @xcite ) , also called extreme downside risk ( edr ) . according to their paper ,",
    "higher edrs led to higher returns .",
    "since the edr in @xcite was calculated from the risk of model fitting to the carhart four - factor model , the edr only considered risks in the residuals and the risk contributions from the factors were ignored . however , according to @xcite , since risk measures are much more sensitive to volatility than to the tail index , considering only the tail index is not a proper way of assessing risks . in @xcite",
    ", the authors found the positive relation between risk measures and future returns using the one - factor models of the risk measures .",
    "however , the one - factor models are not enough to guarantee the predictability of the risk measures on asset returns because no other information on the regression intercepts was not given and the reported t - statistics for the regression estimates were not always statistically significant .    in many asset classes , the patterns in performance and risk characteristics are categorized into two classes .",
    "the first class includes r - ratio , star - ratio and sharpe ratio , and the second category contains cvar .",
    "it is noteworthy that the classification is also associated with the definitions of the reward - risk measures in section [ sec_risk_momentum_rm ] .",
    "the reward - risk measures in the first category are all ratio - based measures . meanwhile , the second category consists of the loss - based measure .",
    "a possible explanation on the outperformance of the ratio - based reward - risk measures is that the r - ratio , star - ratio and sharpe ratio consider not only downside risks but also upward latent profits in the normalized scale .",
    "opposite to the ratio measures , the loss - based strategies tend to select low - risk assets .",
    "it is likely not to consider the volatility along the upward direction which is not the actual risk but the source of potential gains .",
    "as found in the previous section , the reward - risk momentum portfolios achieve better characteristics in performance and risk . for more robust tests ,",
    "the alternative strategies need to be cross - checked with various market factors .",
    "in particular , the carhart four - factor model ( @xcite ) is one of the most well - known regression models in finance .",
    "we analyze the performances of the alternative portfolios in the s&p 500 universe with the carhart four - factor model .",
    "the portfolio returns can be decomposed with respect to the market factor ( mkt ) , size factor ( smb ) , value factor ( hml ) and momentum factor ( mom ) .",
    "the first three factors are three factors in @xcite . for a given reward - risk portfolio ,",
    "the following carhart four - factor analysis on monthly return @xmath40 is conducted , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the regression residual and @xmath43 is the factor exposure to the factor @xmath44 .",

    "not only performances and risk profiles but also the factor exposures highly depend on the origin of a ranking criterion . for example",
    ", reward functions are used in the r - ratio , star - ratio and sharpe ratio but not included into cvar .",
    "that is the reason why the cvar portfolios exhibit the different patterns in performance , risk and factor structures .",
    "the r - ratio portfolios are different in factor structure with the star - ratio and sharpe ratio portfolios .",
    "the explanation is as follows .",
    "the r - ratio based ranking criteria are rewarded by the upside tail gains but the star - ratio and sharpe ratio obtain the benefit from the expected returns .",
    "in this study , we test alternative momentum portfolios based on reward - risk measures in various asset classes and markets .",
    "the reward - risk measures include sharpe ratio , cvar , star - ratio and r - ratio .",
    "the stock selection rules for the reward - risk momentum strategies are calculated from the arma(1,1)-garch(1,1 ) model with cts innovations in order to explain autocorrelation , volatility clustering , skewness and kurtosis in asset return distributions .",
    "regardless of asset class and market , better performances and risk characteristics are obtained through various reward - risk criteria . in particular , the r - ratio(50% , 9x% ) strategies outperform the traditional momentum strategy in every asset class . additionally , the long / short positions of these strategies exhibit stronger momentum than the benchmark strategy , i.e , winners outperform the winner group in the traditional momentum portfolio and losers underperform the loser in the cumulative return .",
    "the r - ratio(9x% , 9x% ) , star - ratio and sharpe ratio strategies perform well and the portfolio volatilities are decreased .",
    "moreover , the alternative portfolios are less riskier in var , cvar and maximum drawdown than the traditional momentum portfolio .",
    "larger @xmath30 parameters also guarantee the thinner downside tails in portfolio return distributions . for ranking groups , less riskier winner baskets are also constructed by the alternative stock selection rules .",
    "it is also observed that performances and risk profiles depend on the characteristics of the momentum group ranking criteria .",
    "the reward - risk measures such as r - ratio and sharpe ratio construct the long / short portfolios with better average returns and lower downside risks .",
    "this tendency is also found at the long / short basket levels .",
    "these facts also impose that considering both of the upside gains and downside losses is helpful to construct better portfolios in performance and risk management .",
    "factor analysis in the s&p 500 universe supports the same conclusion that the factor structures are highly dependent on the types of the ranking criteria .",
    "additionally , the carhart four - factor alphas are not only statistically significant but also larger than that of the benchmark strategy .",
    "the performances of the reward - risk momentum strategies constructed from the ratio - based stock ranking rules are inexplicable by the carhart four - factor model which explains the performances of the cvar portfolios .    in future study ,",
    "various kinds of risk models will be tested in order to construct alternative momentum - style portfolios .",
    "in addition to that , implementation of the reward - risk momentum strategies will be extended to weekly , daily and high frequency scales .",
