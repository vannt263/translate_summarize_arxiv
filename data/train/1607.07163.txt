    "we consider a wiretap channel , comprising a legitimate transmitter , alice , and two receivers : a legitimate one , bob , and a passive adversary , eve .",
    "for the legitimate users alice and bob , both reliable and confidential transmission needs to be achieved , while eve is trying to eavesdrop the communication .",
    "this is done through wiretap coding .",
    "alice encodes her secret @xmath0 into a codeword @xmath1 belonging to a code @xmath2 , and @xmath1 is then sent through the wiretap channel to bob and eve , which respectively receives @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "what distinguishes wiretap coding from standard coding is the constraint on confidentiality , which should be obtained without invoking cryptographic means : confidentiality is obtained by a suitable injection of controlled randomness mixed with an appropriate coding strategy at the transmitter , which enables bob to receive his message with high probability , while confusing the eavesdropper to the point of making her knowledge of the secret message negligible .",
    "this is formally expressed by saying that the mutual information between what eve receives and the secret is zero : @xmath5 or equivalently , that the entropy @xmath6 of the secret knowing the received message at the eavesdropper is the same as the entropy of the secret .",
    "wiretap coding necessarily requires the channel from alice to bob to be different from that from alice to eve .",
    "different \" means , as well as wiretap coding strategies , depend on the channel model , e.g. , discrete memoryless , additive white gaussian , rayleigh fading , or mimo , to name a few popular models ( see @xcite and @xcite for a survey of information theoretic results , resp . coding strategies , for wiretap channels ) .    in all cases , the channel assumptions ,",
    "in particular regarding the eavesdropper s channel , are critical , since the confidentiality analysis relies on them .",
    "this is the case for wiretap coding , but also for any other schemes whose security relies on channel noise , such as secret key generation .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study wiretap coding from an experimental view point using a usrp testbed comprising three usrps , one for each of the three players , alice , bob and eve .",
    "the channels between alice and bob , and alice and eve respectively , are close to slow fading channels , whose snrs and noise are given by the experimental settings .",
    "transmission is done using signal constellations from lattices , which are transmitted using coset coding as explained in section [ sec : coset ] , to introduce controlled randomness ( for that reason , we will use the term  coset coding \" rather than wiretap coding in the rest of the paper ) .",
    "the positions of alice and bob are kept fixed , while we vary the position of eve to analyze her received signal , and how much information is leaked depending on both her position and the coding scheme used .",
    "we present both simulations and experimental results that consistently show how coset coding does provide confusion at the eavesdropper , with entropy ( see subsection [ subsec : ce ] ) and decoding error as metrics , using an optimal decoder for eve , as proven in subsection [ sec : sod ] .",
    "extensive results are provided in section [ sec : simul ] and section [ sec : exp_results ] , to compare coset coding versus conventional coding , but also different coding schemes using lattice constellation of different dimensions , different amounts of randomness and different positions for eve .",
    "experiments were realized by transmitting  the cameraman image \" ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cameraman ] ) , which furthermore allows a visualization of the effect of coset coding ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : camera_man_rx ] ) .",
    "we believe that this type of experimental work is critical to the development of physical layer security , since it gives an insight of how practical a security scheme such as coset coding behaves in practice , without having to rely on channel assumptions .",
    "another work with the same philosophy was done for key generation in @xcite , where the authors investigate the role of the eavesdropper s statistics when actually implementing a secret - key generation system over a wireless channel .",
    "this is done via a software - defined radio testbed , where the channel gains are measured .",
    "the experimental setup shows a 20% loss in secret - key rate with respect to theoretical bounds .",
    "we consider a wiretap testbed formed by three usrps , as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . one usrp plays the role of the legitimate transmitter alice , while the other two usrps are the receivers , bob and eve .",

    "a real lattice @xmath13 of dimension @xmath10 is a discrete set of points in @xmath14 generated as integral linear combinations of a set of @xmath10 linearly independent vectors in @xmath14 . for actual data transmission ,",
    "a finite constellation of the lattice is chosen .",
    "for example , qam constellations are obtained by taking a finite subset of the lattice @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath10 is even , a real lattice can be used for transmission over a complex channel of dimension @xmath16 .",
    "the role of a lattice encoder is to map a bit string to a lattice point .",
    "however for wiretap coding , we use instead lattice coset coding , which allows to introduce randomness .      at the transmitter ,",
    "we implement a lattice coset encoder .",
    "a lattice coset encoder requires two nested lattices @xmath17 , and a partition of @xmath18 as a union of cosets of @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath0 is a coset representative . in fig .",

    "more details on the setup are available in @xcite .",
    "communication between the usrp devices takes place over a sequence of frames where each frame constitutes @xmath37 complex symbols in baseband representation . among the 100 symbols , the first 13 symbols are qpsk modulated pilot symbols which are constructed by identically placing a 13-length binary barker code sequence @xcite on the in - phase and quadrature components .",
    "these pilot symbols are essential for the timing recovery and frame synchronization operations at the receiver .",
    "the rest of the 87 locations in the frame are allocated for data transmission . on the application level",
    ", the digital image is first broken down into a sequence of binary digits ( around 64k bytes in size ) and then these bits are communicated to bob by spreading them over a sequence of frames .",
    "for the uncoded scheme , 87 binary symbols ( from the set @xmath38 ) are embedded into the frame , while for the coded schemes ( both conventional and coset ) , these locations are loaded with uniformly chosen codewords from an underlying lattice code ( carved from @xmath18 , with @xmath39 ) . for the coded schemes , whenever the codewords do not fill the 87 symbols completely , the remainder locations are loaded with dummy symbols . further , note that the codewords of the chosen lattice codes in @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 have components with only non - negative real values .",
    "hence , for implementation purpose , the symbols are appropriately shifted around the origin to reduce the average transmit power .",
    "our method to transmit the lattice codewords of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 is as follows .",
    "irrespectively of whether the strategy is conventional encoding or coset encoding , for any @xmath45 , where @xmath10 is the dimension of the lattice , the transmitted codeword is of the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the average energy of the shifted constellation @xmath48 . using the scale and the shift operation in",

    "the real lattice points are rotated by @xmath50 degrees .",
    "once a frame constituting barker code symbols and lattice codewords @xmath51 is generated , it is subsequently upsampled by @xmath52 and then passed through a square - root raised cosine filter ( with roll - off factor 0.5 ) for pulse shaping purpose ( see fig .",

    "then these samples are forwarded to the simulink block ( with decimation factor 500 ) for baseband processing ( see fig .",
    "[ rx_block ] and [ coset_decoder_block ] for the receiver side baseband operations ) .",
    "a total of 4000 samples ( equivalent to 10 received frames ) are processed batch - wise in order to facilitate frame synchronization and timing recovery operations . for accurate synchronization",
    ", the received samples are passed through an automatic gain control ( agc ) block before it is filtered using a square - root raised cosine receive filter ( with identical parameters as that of the transmit filter ) .",

    "the barker code sequence is independently generated , using which the beginning of the received frames is detected through cross - correlation operations . finally , the _ aligned _ frames are forwarded to the data decoding block ( either conventional or coset ) , which assuming the frame synchronization is accurate , estimates the channel gain using the barker code symbols on the first 13 locations . since the agc gain values may vary across successive frames , we use the estimated channel gain locally within a frame but not across frames . the received lattice codewords by eve of the form @xmath53 are extracted from the frame to carry out the decoding process . here",

    "similarly , for other placements ( which corresponds to lower snr values ) , it can be seen that coset encoding can potentially result in more errors for eve .",

    "the schemes in ( a ) and ( c ) are the same as in section [ subsec : ce ] , however , the one in ( b ) is different from ( c ) as it chooses one bit of randomness instead of two .",
    "the reconstructed images at eve for these cases are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : camera_man_rx ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : camera_man_rx ] , it is clear that eve is able to recover most parts of the image with conventional coding .",
    "although eve s channel is noisier than that of bob ( by the virtue of longer distance ) , conventional coding is unable to introduce confusion for eve at that position .",
    "however , it can be seen that coset coding with one bit confusion results in a more distorted image at eve when compared to conventional coding .",
    "finally , coset encoding with two bits confusion seems to be the best choice for secrecy at placement 4 as no part of the image is visible .",
    "meanwhile , bob can correctly recover the image since he is at a distance much closer to alice , thanks to which , coset coding with two bits confusion does not lead to erroneous reconstruction of the image . in summary , with the knowledge of eve s distance , alice is able to decide on the required number of confusion to maintain secrecy . the same behavior is quantified in fig .",

    "other than using basic coset coding over @xmath43 ( @xmath67 ) , we also demonstrate the effect of higher dimensional coset lattice codes from @xmath44 ( @xmath68 ) , @xmath41 ( @xmath69 ) , and @xmath42 ( @xmath70 ) , by using them to transmit the _ cameraman image _ between the usrp devices . for the experiments with @xmath71",

    "[ fig : rx_ber_d2 ] , we observe that for the location corresponding to 4 db , coset encoding provides close to optimal confusion ( which is 0.5 ) at eve , whereas conventional encoding offers ber smaller than 10% . for the rest of the positions ( equivalently higher snr values )",
    ", eve gets partial knowledge of the secret even with coset encoding scheme .",
    "therefore , the plots suggests that if alice has to provide close to @xmath89 ber for other locations , she might have to increase the number of random bits by ensuring that the error performance at bob does not degrade .",
    "along with the results extracted from the testbed , we also present results obtained from computer simulations , which echo similar observations made from the testbed results .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated the impact of lattice coset codes for introducing confusion at an eavesdropper that experiences a channel that is noisier than that of bob . in the experiments ,",
    "we have incorporated the assumption of degradedness by placing eve farther away from alice than bob . as a natural consequence of farther distance , error performance at eve is worse than that at bob .",
    "in addition , we have shown that adding randomness at the transmitter can further degrade the error performance at eve .",
    "however , additional randomness is carefully added so as not to deteriorate the performance of bob .",
    "one of the main assumptions of this work is that alice knows the location of eve ( or the equivalent signal - to - noise ratio ) , and hence , she can decide on the number of random bits .",
    "a strong defense to this assumption is the scenario wherein there is physical restriction imposed on the proximity of eve .",
    "this work can be further extended in the following directions : ( i ) we have conducted experiments using single antenna devices .",
    "advanced physical - layer techniques can be tested on similar testbeds with multiple antenna devices .",
    "( ii ) we have assumed that the location of the eavesdropper is known to alice ( so as to decide on the amount of randomness to be added ) . a challenging direction for future work is to detect the presence of an eavesdropper based on the local oscillator leakage @xcite , and then estimate its distance to decide on the quantum of randomness .",
    "alternatively , bits could be encoded in a hierarchical manner , providing more protection to the most significant ones .",
