    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) was invented more than 50 years ago by wigner in order to describe the statistical properties of complex nuclei @xcite . in recent years",
    "the fast developments in mesoscopic physics and quantum chaos gave a new boost to the rmt approach @xcite .",
    "the strength of rmt consists in the universality of its predictions containing no energy or length scales or any parameter dependence . at the same time",
    "this is its weakness , because it does not allow to take into account various phenomena appearing in mesoscopic systems which introduce new length scales or parameters in the system .",
    "the breakdown of _ universality _ and the traces of the underlying classical dynamics are important topics in quantum chaos studies and have major applications in mesoscopic physics .",
    "it is therefore highly important to compare the results from rmt models , to the results from systems that have a semiclassical limit , and to look for circumstances where semiclassical tools rather than rmt become relevant . in this paper",
    "we extend our previous studies @xcite on two - dimensional chaotic systems with underlying classical diffusion paying attention to applications of our results for random lasers and microwave absorption .",
    "we identify the signatures of classical diffusion in quantum fluctuations by analyzing the distribution of wavefunction intensities of closed systems , and the resonance widths and wigner delay times of their corresponding scattering analogs .",
    "our analysis is based on a two - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) generalization of the well known kicked rotor ( kr ) model . for large values of the kicking strength",
    "the model is classically chaotic and the dynamics is diffusive .",
    "the detailed analysis of the classical system allows us to extract the relevant parameters that penetrate into the quantum mechanical description .",
    "the quantum analog shows _ dynamical _ localization , @xcite with eigenstates which are exponentially localized in a similar fashion as the eigenstates of disordered systems .",
    "however here the localization occurs due to complicated interference effects created by the underlying classical chaotic dynamics .",
    "attempts were made to put this analogy between the kicked rotor and disordered systems @xcite on a solid base but the problem is still not solved completely @xcite .    since the pioneering work of anderson @xcite it is known that the diffusion in _ disordered _ systems can be affected very strongly by quantum localization .",
    "if the system size exceeds the localization length , then the diffusion is completely suppressed after the time needed for the wave packet to spread over the scale of the localization length .",
    "but even in the absence of strong localization the existence of _ pre - localized _ states @xcite influences the behavior of different physical quantities in the diffusive regime .",
    "having this in mind , it is legitimate to ask , what happens with deterministic _ chaotic _",
    "systems when quantum mechanical description becomes relevant ?",
    "our analysis shows that pre - localized states are present also in the case of dynamical systems and affect various statistical quantities like resonances and wigner delay times . for the analysis of the latter quantities",
    ", we turned the closed kr to a scattering system by imposing ` absorption ' to a set of momentum states .",
    "the resulting scattering matrix is written in terms of the unitary evolution operator of the corresponding closed system and a projection operator .",
    "a detailed description of this construction is presented .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way . in section ii the classical model",
    "is introduced and the main definitions are given .",
    "sections iii and iv are devoted to the corresponding quantum mechanical system .",
    "the quantization on a torus is presented in section iii , while in iv we present a detailed construction of the scattering matrix .",
    "the next two sections v and vi are dedicated to the analysis of various statistical properties of the closed and the open @xmath0 kr model correspondingly .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section vii .",
    "a prominent example of a system with classical diffusion is , the well known in the field of quantum chaos , kicked rotor ( kr ) model @xcite , which consists of the free propagating rotor driven periodically in time by an external force .",
    "since the total energy of a driven system is not a constant of motion any more , the chaotic behavior can appear even in the one - dimensional ( @xmath5 ) case .",
    "although many results are known for the standard @xmath5 kr there is almost no study for its two dimensional generalization , besides ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors have focused on the analysis of dynamical evolution .",
    "the corresponding model is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath6 where the index @xmath7 is related to the first ( second ) rotor correspondingly .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the angular momentum and @xmath9 the conjugate angle of one rotor .",
    "the kick period is @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the kicking strength , while @xmath12 is a constant inversely proportional to the moment of inertia of the rotor .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 is an irrational number whose meaning will be explained below .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) describes a system which is kicked periodically in time .",
    "another representation of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) may be given by one rotor moving on a two - dimensional sphere .",
    "the two rotors are interacting with each other by the potential @xmath14 the parameter @xmath15 breaks time reversal symmetry ( trs ) . the form ( [ pot-2d ] )",
    "was chosen so as to minimize the effect of symmetry breaking on the classical diffusion constant @xmath16 ( see bellow )",

    "the motion generated by this set of maps is integrable in the absence of the kicking potential . for sufficiently small but non - zero @xmath11",
    "the phase space of this system contains both regular islands and chaotic sea ( see fig  [ fig1]a ) .",
    "when @xmath11 is large enough then the dynamics becomes fully chaotic ( see fig .  [ fig1]b ) and there is diffusion in momentum space ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) with diffusion coefficient @xmath23 the last expression is correct within the random phase approximation @xcite ( see appendix  ii ) .",
    "diffusion in momentum space for @xmath24    the corresponding open system is described by the same set of equations ( [ kr - maps2 ] ) as the closed one , on top of which we add absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "namely , we set @xmath8 equal to zero , if @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "these conditions give to `` the particles '' the possibility to escape from the system .",
    "the evolution of the classical density @xmath27 is described by the frobenius - perron equation , which takes in our case the form of the following diffusion equation : @xmath28 with absorbing boundary condition @xmath29 which sets the flux at the boundary @xmath30 to be equal to the number of particles @xmath31 carried out under one iteration of the map .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ dif - kr ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ bcond ] ) can be represented as the superposition of the diffusive eigenmodes @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the corresponding eigenvalues and @xmath35 are coefficients determined by the initial condition .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the density is governed by the smallest eigenvalue @xmath36 .",
    "as a consequence one has an exponential decay of the classical survival probability @xmath37 : @xmath38 the classical decay rate @xmath39 can be estimated as the inverse time needed for the particle to reach the boundary ( thouless time ) .",
    "the exact value of the classical decay rate can be obtained as the solution of the corresponding eigenvalue problem or from the numerical calculation of @xmath40 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present the results of our numerical calculations for @xmath40 for some representative parameters",
    ".     exponential decay of the classical survival probability for open kicked rotor model . ]",
    "because of the periodicity of the external force a time dependent solution of the kr model can be represented as a superposition of floquet states @xcite .",
    "these are the eigenstates of the evolution operator for one period ( floquet operator ) . for kicked systems",
    "the interaction with external force is instantaneous and one can factorize the total floquet operator into the product of the evolution operators corresponding to the free propagation and the interaction .",
    "due to this fact the kicked systems are very convenient for numerical study .    if the @xmath8 are taken mod@xmath41 where @xmath42 are integers , eq .  ( [ ham ] ) defines a dynamical system on a torus .",
    "the quantum mechanics of this system is described by a finite - dimensional time evolution operator for one period @xmath43 \\exp\\[-iv(\\{\\theta_i\\})\\]\\exp\\[-ih_0(\\{{\\cal l}_i\\})t/2\\]\\ ] ] where we put @xmath44 . in the above representation , @xmath45 is symmetric and describes the evolution in the middle of the rotations between two successive kicks . upon quantization , additional symmetries associated with the discreteness of the momentum",
    "show up , which can be destroyed by introducing irrational values for the parameters @xmath46 s .",
    "the most striking consequence of quantization is the suppression of classical diffusion in momentum space due to quantum dynamical localization @xcite .",
    "we introduce the eigenstate components @xmath47 of the floquet operator in the momentum representation by @xmath48 the quantities @xmath49 are known as quasi - energies , and their density is @xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding mean quasi - energy spacing is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the linear size of the system and @xmath53 is the dimensionality ( @xmath54 in our case ) .",
    "the heisenberg time is @xmath55 while @xmath56 is the diffusion time ( thouless time ) .",
    "now one can formally define a dimensionless conductance as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the diffusion coefficient measured in number of kicks .",
    "four length scales are important here : the wavelength @xmath59 , the mean free path @xmath60 , the linear extent of the system @xmath52 , and the localization length @xmath61 . in the rest of this paper we will always assume that @xmath62 the first condition ensures that transport between scattering events may be treated semiclassically .",
    "this limit can be achieved for our system ( [ ham ] ) when @xmath63 , @xmath64 while the classical parameter @xmath65 remains constant . when @xmath66 as long as the motion is not localized ( i.e. @xmath67 ) it is diffusive , since a particle scatters many times before it can traverse the system .",
    "the resulting mean free path for our system ( [ ham ] ) is @xmath68 ( see appendix i ) while the localization length for @xmath69 is @xmath70 @xcite and for @xmath54 is @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "a great advantage of the kicked rotor consists in the fact that due to the unitarity of the evolution operator all its eigenstates have the same statistical properties .",
    "this is in contrast to the eigenstates of hamiltonian models ( like anderson model ) , where the eigenstates belonging to different parts of the spectrum have different statistical properties and therefore they must be picked up from a narrow energy window .",
    "this allow us to collect a huge set of numerical data and perform a rather accurate numerical analysis .",
    "the results of our investigation will be discussed in section v.",
    "to proceed with the analysis of the resonance widths and delay times we turn the closed @xmath0 kr model ( [ uop ] ) into an open one . to this end",
    "we impose ` absorption ' at the boundary of a square sample of size @xmath72 in the momentum space in complete analogy with the classical set - up . in other words , every time that one of the components of the two dimensional momentum @xmath73 takes on the value @xmath74 or @xmath52 , the particle leaves the sample .",
    "the corresponding unitary scattering matrix @xmath75 ( see appendix iii ) is given @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the @xmath78 unit matrix and @xmath79 is a @xmath80 matrix with matrix elements @xmath81 with @xmath82 $ ] the tunnel probability in mode @xmath83 . in the case of perfect coupling , which is considered here , @xmath84 . then @xmath85 and @xmath86 is a @xmath87 diagonal matrix with @xmath88 non - zero elements equal to one . from the physical point of view ,",
    "@xmath79 describe at which `` site '' of the @xmath72 sample we attach @xmath88 `` leads '' [ in our case @xmath89 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath90 is a projection operator onto the boundary , while @xmath91 is the complementary projection operator which satisfies @xmath92 taking this into account , the expression ( [ appsmatr ] ) can be simplified : @xmath93 and using the unitarity of the evolution operator @xmath45 we can rewrite the last expression as follows : @xmath94 the scattering matrix ( [ smatrwig ] ) can equivalently be written in the form used conventionally in quantum chaotic scattering : @xmath95 the scattering matrix @xmath96 given by eq .",
    "( [ smatrix ] ) can be interpreted in the following way : once a wave enters the sample , it undergoes multiple scattering induced by @xmath97^{-1}=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } \\left ( e^{i\\omega } pu\\right)^n$ ] until it is transmitted out .",
    "it is clear therefore that the matrix @xmath98 propagates the wave inside the sample .",
    "however , contrary to the closed system in which the evolution operator is unitary , the absorption breaks the unitarity of the evolution matrix @xmath99 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath99 occurring at complex quasi - energies @xmath100 are the poles of the scattering matrix .",
    "they represent long - lived intermediate states to which bound states of a closed system are converted due to coupling to continua . here",
    "@xmath101 and @xmath102 are the ( dimensionless ) position and width of the resonances , respectively .",
    "having at our disposal the scattering matrix @xmath75 we can calculate the wigner - smith delay time .",
    "it captures the time - dependent aspects of quantum scattering and formally it is defined as @xmath103 and can be interpreted as the typical time an almost monochromatic wave packet remains in the interaction region .",
    "a generalization of the notion of wigner delay time is given through the wigner - smith operator .",
    "the latter is defined as ( for the kicked rotor model one should use quasi - energy instead of energy in the definition of wigner - smith operator ) @xmath104 introducing a new operator @xmath105 and taking the derivative of both sides of eq .",
    "( [ smatrwig ] ) we obtain @xmath106 then the definition of the wigner - smith yields @xmath107 the wigner delay time can be expressed as the sum of proper delay times @xmath108 .",
    "the latter are the eigenvalues of the wigner - smith operator ( [ qmatrix ] ) .",
    "the statistical properties of wavefunction intensities have sparked a great deal of research activity in recent years .",
    "these studies are not only relevant for mesoscopic physics @xcite , but also for understanding phenomena in areas of physics , ranging from nuclear @xcite and atomic @xcite to microwave physics @xcite and optics @xcite .",
    "experimentally , using microwave cavity technics it is possible to probe the microscopic structure of electromagnetic wave amplitudes in chaotic or disordered cavities @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest in this problem was renewed when new effective field theoretical techniques were developed for the study of the distribution of eigenfunction intensities @xmath109 of _ random _ hamiltonians . as the disorder increases",
    ", these results predict that , the eigenfunctions become increasingly non - uniform , leading to an enhanced probability of finding anomalously large eigenfunction intensities in comparison with the random matrix theory prediction . thus , the notion of _ pre - localized _ states , i.e. states which are localized much more strongly than typical eigenstates , has been introduced @xcite to explain the appearance of long tails in the distributions of the conductance and other physical observables @xcite .    up to now all theoretical predictions @xcite and numerical calculations @xcite apply to disordered systems and are based on an ensemble averaging over disorder realizations .",
    "their validity , however , for a quantum _ dynamical _ system ( with a well defined classical limit ) that behaves diffusively is not evident .",
    "here we show that pre - localized states exist also for dynamical systems with underlying classical diffusion and investigate the effect of these states in @xmath110 .",
    "an example of them is reported in fig .",
    "( [ single - als ] ) .",
    "our main conclusion is that in a generic dynamical system with classical diffusion , @xmath110 is described quite well by the nonlinear @xmath111model ( nlsm ) .",
    "we point out that between the various theoretical works there is a considerable disagreement about the parameters that control the shape of @xmath110 and their dependence on time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "more specifically , the nlsm suggests that the tail of @xmath110 in two dimensions ( @xmath112 ) is sensitive to trs @xcite , while a direct optimal fluctuation ( dof ) method predicts a symmetry independent result @xcite .",
    "this prediction was an additional motivation for the present study .",

    "the size of the system is @xmath113 , the diffusion coefficient @xmath114    in the next subsection we calculate the distribution function @xmath115 by using a direct diagonalization of the floquet operator ( [ uop ] ) .",
    "the trs is broken entirely for @xmath116 , i.e. the phase difference for a typical trajectory and its time - reversal counterpart is larger than @xmath117 , so that all interference effects between time - reversal trajectories are suppressed . in order to test the issue of dynamical correlations ,",
    "we randomize the phases of the kinetic term of the evolution operator ( [ uop ] ) and calculate the resulting @xmath118 .",
    "this model will be referred to as random phase kr ( rpkr ) .",
    "since all our eigenfunctions have the same statistical properties ( in contrast to the anderson cases where one should pick up only eigenfunctions having eigenenergies within a small energy interval @xcite ) we make use of all of them in our statistical analysis .",
    "the classical parameter @xmath119 is large enough in all cases to exclude the existence of any stability islands in phase space , the accelerator modes known for kr @xcite are avoided as well .",
    "the influence of the accelerator modes on the eigenfunction statistics is an interesting problem , which is out of the scope of the present study and deserves a separate investigation .",
    "the classical diffusion coefficient @xmath120 is calculated numerically by iterating the classical map obtained from ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "below we present our numerical results and compare them to the predictions of refs .",
    "@xcite .",

    "this result can be easily understood .",
    "indeed , within the random matrix theory one assumes that all the eigenvector components are independent ( the normalization of the eigenvector is not essential in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. when the number of its components becomes very large ) random variables obeying gaussian distribution .",
    "going to the distribution of the modulus square of the components one immediately recovers eq .",

    "the leading term of this expansion is given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the @xmath112 diffusion propagator ( time - integrated return probability ) , which is identical for @xmath133 and @xmath134 since it is a classical quantity .",
    "figures [ fig6](a ) and ( b ) show corrections to @xmath135 for @xmath136 for two representative values of @xmath120 . we find again that the form of the deviations are very well described by eq .",
    "( [ q1dor ] ) and the agreement becomes better for larger values of the diffusion constant .",
    "this is due to the fact that by increasing @xmath120 we are approaching the semiclassical region and therefore eqs .",
    "( [ ftpr ] ) are better satisfied . at the same time",

    "the fact that the prediction of a dof method is not observed in our calculations might be due to non - universal ( depending on the type of disorder ) character of this result .",
    "in this section we analyze the statistical properties of resonances @xmath1 and wigner delay times @xmath180 for a @xmath0 diffusive system .",
    "this study is important for various applications among which are diffusive random lasers and microwave cavities @xcite where most of the theoretical treatment is limited by rmt .",
    "we point here that current developments of microwave experiments in random dielectric media in the diffusive regime @xcite may allow us a direct comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "specifically , we have found that the resonance width distribution @xmath181 is given by @xmath182 while the distribution of the wigner delay times , is given by the following expressions : @xmath183 where @xmath16 is the classical diffusion constant , @xmath123 denotes the symmetry class and @xmath184 is some constant of order unity .",

    "the parameters of the model were chosen in such a way that the conditions ( [ ftpr ] ) discussed in the previous section were fulfilled . in order to improve our statistics , we randomized the phases of the kinetic term of the evolution operator ( [ uop ] ) and used a number of different realizations .",

    "( [ gammas ] ) for large resonances @xmath242 .",
    "since this difference appears in the `` classical '' part of the distribution , it can be explained as a difference in the classical dynamics of a particle inside the system : ballistic ( rmt ) versus diffusive motion .",

    "the existence of the gap can be understood , if one relates the small resonances to the coupling of the wavefunctions to the leads . since the wavefunctions in the rmt are extended , the probability to find a wavefunction , which is weakly coupled to all @xmath88 channels , goes to zero when the number of channels becomes very large @xmath249 . in the diffusive regime , in contrast , there are pre - localized states , which are weakly coupled to the leads . due to their existence",
    "the distribution of the small resonance widths has a non - trivial behavior described by eq .",

    "we turn now to the analysis of wigner delay times and calculate their probability distribution .",
