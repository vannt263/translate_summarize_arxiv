    "the discovery of neutrino masses requires an extension of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the most promising scenario for giving masses to neutrinos is the see - saw mechanism @xcite , which provides a convincing explanation for their smallness .",
    "it typically introduces heavy , gauge - singlet neutrinos and thereby gives small majorana masses to the sm neutrinos .",
    "when the sm is viewed as an effective field theory , majorana masses for the neutrinos can be introduced via higher dimensional operators of sm fields .",
    "the lowest dimensional operator of this kind has dimension 5 and couples two lepton and two higgs doublets .",
    "it appears e.g.  in the see - saw mechanism by integrating out the heavy singlets .",
    "the experimental results in the neutrino sector provide an interesting new way for testing theories beyond the sm . in order to compare the experimental results with predictions from models beyond the sm , like unified theories ,",
    "it is essential to evolve the masses , mixing angles and cp phases from high to low energies .",
    "this is accomplished with the renormalization group equations ( rge s ) for the neutrino mass operators in the theory valid at intermediate energy scales .",
    "this theory may be the sm , but can also be an extension like a two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) or the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .    in a recent letter @xcite we discussed the derivation of the rge for the dimension 5 neutrino mass operator in the sm . in this letter",
    "we derive the rge s for the corresponding operators in a class of 2hdm s and the mssm .",
    "in many extensions of the sm , the higgs sector is enlarged by introducing additional @xmath1 doublet scalar fields @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) . these can couple to the sm fermions via the yukawa couplings @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the @xmath8 doublets of sm leptons and quarks , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the @xmath8-singlet ( right - handed ) charged leptons , down - type quarks and up - type quarks .",
    "@xmath12 is the totally antisymmetric tensor in 2 dimensions and @xmath13 are su(2 ) indices .",
    "summation over repeated indices is implied throughout this letter .",
    "we have chosen the notation in equation in such a way that all @xmath2 transform as @xmath14 under @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath16 we obtain the sm .",
    "note that there are tight phenomenological constraints on yukawa couplings . as pointed out in @xcite , it is very hard to construct viable models in which one type of sm fermions @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 couples to two or more higgs bosons , since this in general leads to tree - level flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc s )",
    ". therefore , we will only consider models in which the fermions couple to at most one higgs . as a consequence ,",
    "the suffix `` @xmath20 '' on the yukawa couplings in equation is redundant and will be omitted in the following .",
    "we concentrate on models with two higgs doublets for simplicity , i.e.@xmath21 , and consider only schemes in which each of the right - handed sm fermions couples to exactly one higgs boson .",
    "all inequivalent possibilities are classified in table [ tab : classificationof2hdm ] . by convention , the scalar which couples to @xmath17",
    "is defined to be @xmath22 .",
    "lcccc    .classification of the 2hdm s with natural suppression of fcnc s and tree - level mass terms for all sm fermions except neutrinos .",
    "note that model ( i ) is usually referred to as `` type i '' and ( ii ) as `` type ii '' in the literature .",

    "in the mssm , the effective dimension 5 operator that gives majorana masses to the sm neutrinos is contained in the @xmath37-term of the superpotential @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the chiral superfields that contain the su(2)@xmath41 doublets , the higgs doublet with weak hypercharge @xmath42 and the corresponding superpartners .",
