    "magnetars are neutron stars with super - strong magnetic fields .",
    "the typical magnetic strength of magnetars is of the order of @xmath6 , which is higher than the critical magnetic field @xmath7 , and is @xmath8 times stronger than that of normal pulsars .",
    "historically , they were discovered in two manifestations , i.e. anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , even though later observations suggested that there seems no clear distinction between the two sub - categories .",
    "sgrs are discovered in the hard x - ray / soft gamma - ray band characterized by repeating bursts .",
    "eleven sgrs have been confirmed so far @xcite .",
    "three of them each displayed one giant flare ( sgr 0526 - 66 on march 5 , 1979 ; sgr 1900 + 14 on august 27 , 1998 ; sgr 1806 - 20 on december 27 , 2004 ) .",
    "these giant flares are characterized by an initial short - hard spike followed by a pulsating tail @xcite .",
    "the initial spike has a duration of @xmath9 , and an isotropic energy of @xmath10 .",
    "the pulsating tail , on the other hand , shows a decay pattern and is characterized by a typical duration of @xmath11 , an isotropic energy of @xmath1 , and a pulsating period of a few seconds ( the magnetar spin period ) .",
    "the spectrum of the early spike is characterized by a temperature of @xmath12 , which is much harder than that of normal sgr bursts .",
    "the spectrum of the pulsating tail is softer than that of the initial spike , which may be fitted with the superposition of a thermal component with @xmath13 and a non - thermal power law component .",
    "the decay light curves of the pulsating tail typically show time - evolving , complex pulse profiles .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the tail emission likely originates from the residual energy of the explosion that gives rise to the initial spike . owing to the large energy density and strong magnetic field pressure in the magnetar magnetosphere",
    ", the residual energy is confined in the magnetosphere in the form of an optically thick photon - pair plasma named a `` trapped fireball '' .",
    "such a trapped fireball would be the source of the thermal emission component observed in the pulsating tail .",
    "the power law spectral component may be formed from the jets associated with the open - field lines that are outside the trapped fireballs @xcite .",
    "the structure of the trapped fireball may determine the pulse profile of the pulsating tail .",
    "in fact , the magnetars show more complicated pulse structure profiles during the giant flare decaying phase than during the quiescent phase , the latter of which typically shows a single , broad - peak , nearly sinusoidal pulse shape .",
    "for example , the decay phase of the giant flare of sgr 0526 - 66 on march 5 , 1979 showed a double - peak pulse profile @xcite ; the giant flare of sgr 1900 + 14 on august 27 , 1998 showed a complex four - peak profile @xcite ; and the giant flare of sgr 1806 - 20 on december 27 , 2004 showed a roughly three - peak profile @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the temperature of the phase - resolved spectra during the decay phase shows a different evolution pattern from the light curve : for sgr 1900 + 14 , the phase - resolved temperature shows two peaks in each period , with the epoch of the highest thermal flux corresponding to the lowest count rate in the light curve @xcite ; for sgr 1806 - 20 , on the other hand , the evolution of temperature seems to track the photon count in the light curve @xcite .",
    "therefore , the true structure of the trapped fireball is likely very complex .",
    "the effective blackbody radius inferred from the data suggests that the radius of the trapped fireball is a few times of the magnetar radius @xcite , which suggests that the trapped fireball should be in the magnetosphere rather than being a hot spot on the magnetar surface .",
    "a natural idea is that the trapped fireball is a closed - field region in the magnetosphere ( and the non - thermal emission comes from the open field line regions ) .",
    "the multi - peak profile of the light curves might be the result of the inhomogeneous distribution of the plasmas within the trapped fireball and the non - thermal jets within the magnetosphere . due to the complexity of the problem itself , it is not easy to fully understand the mechanism of the giant flares",
    ". nonetheless , a simple model that assumes that the trapped fireball is from a closed field region in the magnetosphere may catch the essence of the problem .",
    "polarization is a key element to test theoretical models of the physical processes and geometric structure of magnetars .",
    "unfortunately , none of the three giant flares were detected with polarimeters , so that their polarization properties remain a mystery .",
    "thanks to technological development and funding support , a few x - ray/@xmath14-ray polarimeters are imminent , which would make ground - breaking discoveries to study the underlying physics in many astrophysical objects , such as isolated neutron stars , magnetars , x - ray pulsars , pulsar wind nebulae , rotation - powered pulsars , and millisecond x - ray pulsars @xcite .",
    "for example , in the conventional x - ray band ( @xmath15 ) , polarimeters that are under construction include imaging x - ray polarimetry explorer ( ixpe , @xcite ) , polarimeter for relativistic astrophysical x - ray sources ( praxys , @xcite ) .",
    "for hard x - rays and soft-@xmath14-rays ( above @xmath16 ) , several detector concepts have been proposed .",
    "for example , there has been an extensive study of the poet ( polarimeters for energetic transients ) mission concept @xcite as well as its extension leap ( large area polarimeter ) . on the other hand , the polar detector @xcite",
    ", a compton polarimeter designed to measure linear polarization of gamma - rays from gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , is scheduled to be launched with the chinese space station tiangong-2 in 2016 .",
    "polar has a large effective area of @xmath17 and a field - of - view covering about one third of the sky .",
    "its energy band covers from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , which can cover part of the energy range of the pulsating tail of sgr giant flares . for a total flux larger than @xmath20",
    ", polar can perform a measure of polarization degree with a relative systematic error @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "it would be an ideal detector for giant flare polarization studies , should such a giant flare occurs during its mission period .    among the available detectors , the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) is an instrument designed to study the brightest solar flares , which has the polarization detecting capability @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the giant flare of sgr 1806 - 20 on december 27 , 2004 was detected with rhessi @xcite .",
    "however , no polarization study of the pulsating tail emission of this event is published .",
    "many authors have calculated the polarization properties from neutron stars .",
    "@xcite calculated the polarization of thermal x - rays from isolated neutron stars with strong magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite studied radiation spectra from the atmosphere of neutron stars and the effect of vacuum polarization . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the birefringence of the magnetized qed vacuum decouples the polarization modes up to a large radius , so that the surface polarization of neutron stars can be sufficiently large to be observed . @xcite and",
    "@xcite calculated the soft x - ray polarization in thermal magnetar emission from a hot spot centered around the magnetic dipole axis .",
    "@xcite studied the x - ray polarization signature of the magnetosphere of quiescent magnetars .",
    "@xcite studied how future x - ray polarization measurements by the next generation detectors may be used to probe the magnetar magnetospheric structure .    in this paper , we study the atmospheric structure and polarization properties of trapped fireballs during the decay phase of giant flares . since the radiation mechanism of the non - thermal component is still uncertain , we mainly consider the thermal emission component from the trapped fireball .",
    "observationally , the thermal radiation component seems to dominate the observed emission during most phases in the decaying tail , and the flux level of the thermal component is higher than that of the power - law component between @xmath16 and @xmath22 @xcite . the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we introduce a simple model of the atmospheric structure of the trapped fireball . in sect .",
    "3 , the photon polarization properties are calculated by considering dielectric tensor of the electron - positron pair plasma as well as the effect of vacuum polarization , and the scattering opacities for the two photon modes are presented . in sect .",
    "we calculate the polarization degree of the trapped fireball using monte carlo simulations .",
    "the results are summarized in sect .",
    "5 with some discussion .",
    "in this section , we calculate the atmospheric structure of the trapped fireball in a simplified model . we assume a dipolar configuration for the magnetar magnetic fields , and take the region enclosed by a closed field line ( not necessarily the last closed field line ) as the trapped fireball ( fig.1 ) .",
    "thanks to the extreme large optical depth of the trapped fireball , we only need to solve the equations in a relatively thin layer ( the bisque layer shown in fig.1 ) , which corresponds to the radius range from an optical depth @xmath23 ( bottom of the atmosphere of the trapped fireball ) to @xmath24 .",
    "the observed photons mostly come from this region .",
    "the structure of this thin atmosphere can be solved via a set of equations , including the magnetic dipole field equation , the equations of state , the hydrostatic equilibrium equation , the energy transport equation , and the optical depth equation .",
    "the total energy radiated in the pulsating tail of a giant flare is @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the requirement for the energy being trapped by magnetic fields demands @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the radius of the neutron star , and @xmath28 is the scale of the trapped fireball ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath29 comes from converting the internal energy density ( both the thermal energy and the radiation energy ) of the trapped fireball to pressure . for a dipolar field ,",
    "one has @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the characteristic surface magnetic field strength of the neutron star .",
    "observations show that the effective radius of thermal emission is a few times of the magnetar radius , @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we therefore require that the magnetic field strength satisfies @xmath33 which suggests that the neutron star is a magnetar . in the closed field line region ,",
    "the electron - positron pair plasma is trapped , since transport of charged particles across field lines is suppressed by strong magnetic fields , and since gravity is no longer the dominant confining force .",
    "the critical trapping luminosity @xmath34 can be estimated by the balance between the radiative energy density and the magnetic energy density @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 which is much larger than the luminosity of the giant flares .    for a magnetic dipole field ,",
    "the strength of the magnetic field at a point @xmath37 is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the polar cap magnetic field strength at the surface .",
    "the border of the closed magnetosphere field lines that enclose the trapped fireball is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the maximum radius .",
    "next , we consider the equation of state in such a trapped fireball .",
    "the deposition of @xmath42 in the magnetosphere is sufficient to generate a hot photon - pair plasma .",
    "for the internal region of the trapped fireball , the electron - positron pairs are mildly - relativistic .",
    "the total energy density of the photon - pair plasma is @xmath43 ( see eq .",
    "( [ a8 ] ) in appendix ) .",
    "the temperature in the internal region of the fireball is @xmath44 . for the atmosphere of the trapped fireball , on the other hand ,",
    "observations show that its effective temperature is @xmath45 , which is much less than the first landau level energy @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , this is a one - dimensional , magnetized , and non - relativistic electron - positron pair plasma , whose density is given by ( see eq .",
    "( [ a9 ] ) in appendix ) @xmath47 we apply an ideal gas equation of state and assume that the gas is in local thermodynamic equilibrium with the radiation field .",
    "the total pressure @xmath48 is given by the sum of the gas pressure @xmath49 , radiation pressure @xmath50 , and magnetic pressure @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 the giant flare pulsating tails are characterized by a duration of @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the trapped fireball is in hydrostatic equilibrium during the pulsating tail phase : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the gravitational potential .",
    "for the dipolar magnetic field , the magnetic stress in radial direction ( @xmath55 direction ) is given by @xmath56_{r}=-\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\left(\\frac{b_p}{2}\\right)^2\\frac{r_s^6}{r^7}[1 + 5\\cos^2(\\theta)].\\label{stress}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore one has @xmath57+f_b,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the neutron star mass ( with the trapped fireball mass neglected ) , and @xmath59 is the gravitational radius . here",
    ", we neglect the term @xmath60 in the general oppenheimer - volkoff equation , because its contribution is always smaller than @xmath61 in our atmosphere model . in order to solve the atmospheric structure",
    ", we also need the temperature gradient equation @xmath62 where @xmath63 is determined by the energy transport equation .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , convection is strongly suppressed by strong magnetic fields of magnetars .",
    "we therefore only consider radiative transport in this paper .",
    "for simplicity of treatment and without losing generality , we use the result from the radiative transport in spherical symmetry @xcite , which is given by @xmath64\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\left[1+\\frac{p+1.5p_g+3p_r+p_b}{\\rho c^2}\\right]^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the luminosity of the photosphere ( i.e. the observed luminosity of the pulsating tail ) , and @xmath66 is the rosseland mean opacity , which is discussed in the next section . in order to obtain the scale length of the photosphere",
    ", one also needs the optical depth equation @xmath67 finally , we introduce the boundary of the bottom of the atmosphere that is defined by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the maximum radius of the closed line of the atmosphere bottom , and @xmath70 is the temperature at the bottom of the atmosphere . using eqs.([dipole])-([pressure ] ) and eqs.([stress])-([optical ] ) , we can then solve for the atmospheric structure of the trapped fireball .",
    "we assume @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , the rotation period of the magnetar @xmath74 , and the luminosity of the pulsating tail @xmath75 . since observations show that the effective radius of the thermal emission is a few times of the radius of the magnetar , we assume that the maximum radius of the bottom of the atmosphere is @xmath76 .",
    "the corresponding temperature @xmath70 at @xmath69 should be less than the pair production temperature @xmath77 in order to reach a quasi - steady state solution . in our model ,",
    "we take @xmath78 . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the temperature is so low that the thermal electron - positron pair density decreases exponentially with temperature , leading to a very low optical depth .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig5 ] , we plot the temperature , optical depth , number density of electron - positron pairs and pressure as a function of the radial distance from the bottom of the atmosphere @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the radial distance from the neutron star center to the bottom of the atmosphere ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , with @xmath82 denoted by dotted , dashed and solid lines ) . for the given boundary condition described above",
    ", the atmosphere is very thin @xmath83 and the effective temperature at the photosphere ( @xmath84 ) is @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed temperature of the pulsating tail .",
    "the temperatures for different @xmath87 have little difference for @xmath88 , and the temperature near the magnetosphere equator is higher than that near the pole for @xmath89 . the optical depth from the direction near the pole is lower than that in the direction of the equator , which means that the flux near the pole might be higher . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we find that the electron - positron pair number density decreases rapidly when @xmath89 .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows pressure as a function of the radial distance to the atmosphere bottom @xmath80 .",
    "the electron - positron pairs , radiation and magnetic pressures are denoted by black , red and blue lines , respectively .",
    "one can see that the total pressure is dominated by the magnetic pressure , so that the pair plasma is trapped in the magnetosphere .",
    "near the equator , one has @xmath90 .",
    "however , near the pole , the gas pressure could be larger than the radiation pressure at the atmosphere bottom .",
    "the result suggests that the pressure at the pole decreases more rapidly than that of the equator , since the temperature at the pole decreases from a smaller radius @xmath80 .",

    "conversely , o - mode photons become more dominant in harder bands . the number ratio between e - mode and o - mode photons , @xmath285 , is higher for @xmath286 than for @xmath287 , as a result of the suppression of the e - mode photon opacity in strong magnetic fields near the magnetic pole .",

    "the maximum polarization degree from the trapped fireball is lower than that ( @xmath293 ) from a hot spot on the pole of the magnetar surface @xcite or in the quiescent magnetar magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "this is mostly due to the extended thermal emission from a trapped fireball and the wider collected band , e.g. @xmath3 or @xmath5 considered in our work .",
    "( iii . ) during the photon propagation in the magnetic vacuum , due to the adiabatic condition ( @xmath294 ) , the electric vector direction of the electromagnetic wave continues to change according to the direction of the local magnetic field . because the polarization - limit radius @xmath271 is much larger than that of the trapped fireball radius , the electric vectors of all the photons with a certain energy emitted from the photosphere rotate a same angle @xmath278 as they escape the magetosphere .",
    "( iv . ) the polarization degree at @xmath295 can be as large as @xmath296 in 1 - 30 kev , and is @xmath297 in 30 - 100 kev .",

    "if the future observations confirm the polarization signal at the predicted level , it would suggest the following :    ( i. ) the magnetar hypothesis is correct .",
    "even if the magnetar model is the leading model to interpret sgrs , some other scenarios have been proposed to interpret sgrs without introducing strong magnetic fields .",
    "for example , in the accretion models @xcite , the strength of the magnetic field is weak , i.e. @xmath298 . according to eq.([eq : qed - radius ] ) , the qed polarization limiting radius would be @xmath299 , which is not much larger than the scale of the trapped fireball",
    ". this would give rise to a much smaller polarization degree .",
    "qed is right : a high polarization degree suggests that vacuum polarization indeed makes a corrected contribution to the dielectric tensor and the magnetic permeability tensor , and that the qed vacuum is birefringent .",
    "otherwise the polarization degree would be less than @xmath297 even for @xmath287 .",
    "a polarization measurement would reveal the geometry of the system .",
    "since @xmath285 is of the order of unity , the polarization degree is mainly determined by the magnetic field line directions .",
    "therefore , a relatively large polarization degree corresponds to an ordered magnetic field configuration , and a relatively large angle between the magnetic pole and line of sight .",
    "( iv . ) the idea of the pair - plasma trapped fireball is right : different from the electron - ion plasma , the pair plasma has no vacuum resonance point and ion cyclotron absorption .",
    "both e - mode and o - mode photons are entirely linearly polarized .",
    "the properties of pair opacity are also very different from that of electron - ion plasma .",
    "therefore , an observed polarization degree at the predicted level would prove that the trapped fireball is indeed a photon - pair plasma .    in our monte carlo simulations",
    ", we have assumed an aligned rotator ( the rotation axis and magnetic axis overlap ) , so that the @xmath205 angle is constant for a particular observer . in reality , the two axes are mis - aligned .",
    "the slow rotation of the magnetars would not affect the @xmath205-dependent polarization degrees calculated in this paper .",
    "however , a certain observer would view the magnetosphere in a range of @xmath205 values .",
    "the average polarization degree would be between the minimum and maximum @xmath300 values defined the maximum and minimum @xmath205 , which would usually be still @xmath297 in the 1 - 30 kev band ( or a few percent in 30 - 100 kev ) , unless the two axes are nearly aligned and the line of sight is also very close to the pole .",
