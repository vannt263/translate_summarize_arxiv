    "a powerful method for understanding the dynamics of coupled oscillators comes from noting that @xmath0 limit cycle oscillators give rise to a normally hyperbolic invariant torus that persists for weak enough coupling @xcite . in such cases",
    "we can describe the asymptotic dynamics in terms of just phases .",
    "a specific example of a coupled identical phase oscillator system with global ( all - to - all ) coupling is that of kuramoto @xcite @xmath8 with fixed natural frequency @xmath9 , coupling strength @xmath10 .",
    "although the original work of kuramoto considered @xmath11 , a more general `` kuramoto - sakaguchi '' coupling ( phase interaction ) function @xcite is @xmath12 for the system ( [ eq : tnkuramoto],[eq : kuramotocoupling ] ) , the only attractors are full synchrony or full asynchrony , depending on the value of the parameter @xmath13 , while in the special case @xmath14 the system is integrable .",
    "many papers have studied the dynamics of this and related systems ; see for example @xcite . for this permutation symmetric case of identical oscillators ,",
    "the system above is known to behave in ways that are not generic , even accounting for symmetries .",
    "there can be a large number of integrals of the motion @xcite and degenerate bifurcation behaviour on varying @xmath13 @xcite . as pointed out in @xcite , for weak linear coupling of nonlinear systems near hopf bifurcation ,",
    "one expects to have a coupling function @xmath15 that is smooth and @xmath16-periodic @xcite .",
    "that is , the generic situation is that all @xmath17 will be non - zero in the fourier expansion @xmath18 where the @xmath17 will decay with @xmath19 at a rate that will depend on the smoothness of @xmath15 .",
    "however , recent work by rosenblum , pikovsky and co - workers has highlighted that more complex interactions may be present in coupled oscillator systems , and that this may lead to new emergent phenomena such as self - organized quasiperiodicity @xcite on including an additional damped equation , or on including direct dependence of a phase shift @xmath20 on an order parameter @xcite .",
    "the current paper considers generic nonlinear , but fully permutation symmetric , weak coupling of @xmath0 identical hopf bifurcations .",

    "although hopf bifurcation in the absence of symmetry can generically be reduced to a two dimensional centre manifold , this is not the case here - the action of the symmetry group @xmath1 means that for @xmath5 the centre manifold at generic bifurcation will generically be either @xmath71 dimensional or @xmath72 dimensional . in the uncoupled case @xmath73 the extra structure means that the centre manifold will be @xmath74 dimensional .",
    "using equivariant bifurcation theory @xcite it is possible to write the system of odes ( [ eq : rdsystem ] ) on a centre manifold @xmath75 where in the case @xmath73 the centre manifold in each coordinate @xmath76 is parametrized by @xmath77 .",
    "this system on the centre manifold is @xmath78 where @xmath79 and we note the right hand sides can be chosen to be @xmath80 , with @xmath81 arbitrarily large , in a neighbourhood of the bifurcation .",

    "the only possibility of there being no non - trivial two - cluster solution is at such a bifurcation point , such that @xmath301 and @xmath299 has the same sign for all @xmath302 .",
    "moreover , the dependence on @xmath13 of @xmath303 and @xmath304 means we can conclude the following result about the set of possible two - cluster states . note that the case @xmath305 corresponds to the case of there being only pairwise coupling in .",
    "[ thm : twoclusters ] for system in the special case of pairwise coupling and any @xmath306 either    * @xmath307 is independent of @xmath13 and @xmath308 for all @xmath309 , or * @xmath308 for at most one @xmath284 .    in the more general case",
    "where does not hold , there can be an additional case    * @xmath310 is a root of @xmath311 for two distinct @xmath284 .",
    "moreover , this case does appear for certain choices of parameters .",
    "* proof :  * this follows on noting that if there is pairwise coupling then the dependence on @xmath13 is @xmath312 , @xmath313 , @xmath314 , @xmath315 .",

    "if this quantity satisfies @xmath317 then there is a corresponding two cluster state with close to this phase difference , for large enough @xmath0 ( exactly this phase difference if @xmath13 is rational ) .",

    "in summary , we study a system of @xmath0 identical systems near generic hopf bifurcation that are symmetrically and weak coupled . in such a case ,",
    "reduction to a phase description will be possible for some neighbourhoor , but a pairwise - coupling models such as may miss a number of qualitatively different terms .",

    ". these terms will be important especially near a secondary bifurcation where well - known degeneracies of ( [ eq : tnkuramoto],[eq : kuramotocoupling ] ) will be unfolded .",
    "we can not guarantee that the truncation ( [ principaleq2trun ] ) has the same qualitative dynamics as ( [ principaleq2 ] ) unless the dynamics of the former is robust to addition of higher order terms . although @xmath3 is small , we assume @xmath2 must be smaller in order for the reduction to hold - in the event that this does not hold then there may be solutions where the amplitude of the different oscillators may vary considerably , and the picture of possible dynamics may be much richer @xcite .",
    "in addition to the restrictions on the number of phases interacting , the form of the functions is illuminating - reveals that while @xmath39 has first and second harmonics , @xmath328-@xmath329 have only first harmonics to this lowest order .",
    "the presence of the phase - dependent frequency detuning @xmath23 in is somewhat surprising .",
    "this term is invariant under permutations of the arguments of @xmath330 and so does not give any effect in the phase difference dynamics and hence on the synchrony properties of the system .",
    "however , it will be a measurable effect , for example , affecting the frequencies of different states of synchrony that will be missing from the system ( [ eq : tnkuramoto ] ) .",
    "if we look at the special case of _ pairwise _ ( or the even more special case of _ linear _ ) coupling of nonlinear systems undergoing hopf bifurcation , of the form @xmath331 then clearly this will give @xmath328 , @xmath332 and @xmath329 identically zero . while the @xmath39 terms in may be quite complex and can have higher fourier modes - previous work on this pairwise coupling has demonstrated present of a rich range of behaviours including robust attracting heteroclinic cycles ( slow switching ) @xcite and arbitrary cluster states @xcite .",
    "we remark that terms present in @xmath39 are also present in the work of hansel _ et al _ @xcite and the generalization @xcite .",
    "the example we give in theorem  [ thm : twoclusters ] is a new but subtle dynamical effect that can appear for non - pairwise coupling .",
    "we expect there are more remarkable implications of non - pairwise coupling waiting to be discovered . for example , there are systems of pairwise coupled system of the form ( [ eq : tnkuramoto ] ) with @xmath333 or more identical oscillators that possess chaotic attracting states , at least for @xmath334 with least four harmonics @xcite .",
    "it is still unknown whether there is a @xmath39 that gives chaotic attractors for all sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "we speculate that the additional terms @xmath328-@xmath329 may give broader regions of existence of chaotic attractors for ( [ principaleq],[eq : coupform ] ) using coupling functions with fewer harmonics .",
    "we finish by mentioning a couple of examples from the literature that have non - pairwise coupling . in @xcite",
    "the authors consider coupled phase oscillators of the form @xmath335 where the order parameter is @xmath336 writing in terms of phases only we find @xmath337 which includes non - pairwise terms that include all @xmath0 phases .",

    "we assume the only dynamic variables are those undergoing hopf bifurcation .",
    "close in spirit to our paper is the analysis of @xcite who consider three communities of oscillators with frequencies @xmath338 , @xmath339 such that @xmath340 .",
    "they find three - phase interactions in the phases of the order parameters , using an ott - antonsen reduction @xcite . by comparison",
