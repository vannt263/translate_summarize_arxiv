    "the purpose of this paper is to explain certain instances in which the logarithmic mahler measure @xmath0 of a polynomial @xmath1 $ ] can be written in an unexpectedly neat manner .",
    "to begin , we offer three examples that illustrate this sort of phenomenon . in the formulas below @xmath7",
    "refers to the bloch-@xmath8wigner dilogarithm , @xmath6 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the field @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the corresponding zeta function .",
    "@xmath15 all three equalities were conjectured on the basis of numerical evidence ; however , we will later provide a proof of the first formula .",
    "as we shall see , these statements are different manifestations of the same underlying principle involving the galois descent property for bloch groups .",
    "it is natural at this point to ask for a description of the set of all polynomials to which this principle applies .",
    "we will demonstrate that this set includes ( but does not appear to be limited to ) certain tempered , parametrizable polynomials . along the way we will also present a general method for computing the mahler measure of any parametrizable polynomial .",
    "we begin with a few preliminary definitions and background .",
    "the logarithmic mahler measure of a polynomial @xmath16 $ ] is given by @xmath17 where the @xmath18-torus @xmath19 consists of all complex @xmath18-tuples @xmath20 with @xmath21 . in particular , this integral converges even though @xmath22 may vanish on  @xmath19 . despite this somewhat analytical definition ,",
    "mahler measure bears surprisingly diverse connections to topics in number theory and geometry .",
    "thus boyd  @xcite and rodriguez villegas  @xcite have produced polynomials @xmath1 $ ] for which @xmath0 may be expressed in terms of the @xmath23-function of an associated elliptic curve evaluated at @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , boyd @xcite has related mahler measure to volumes of hyperbolic manifolds , which permits proofs of some identities that he had observed .",
    "finally , in certain instances maillot  @xcite , vandervelde  @xcite , and lalin  @xcite have found ways to express @xmath0 in terms of the shape , side lengths , and angles within a single cyclic polygon .    in the case of one - variable polynomials",
    "it is always possible to obtain an explicit expression for mahler measure by using jensen s formula .",
    "one finds that if @xmath25 , then @xmath26 where @xmath27 for @xmath28 while @xmath29 when @xmath30 .",
    "this tool will enable us to perform the first integration for polynomials in two variables .",
    "clearly @xmath31 , so we need only analyze irreducible polynomials , which we will assume to be the case in what follows .",
    "finally , we will often present @xmath22 via its newton polygon , in which each term @xmath32 is represented by labeling the point @xmath33 with the coefficient  @xmath34 , as done below .",
    "@xmath35 since multiplication by powers of @xmath36 or  @xmath37 does not affect mahler measure , we will usually neglect to specify the origin , or assume that the newton polygon ` rests ' against the axes .",
    "the edge polynomials are obtained by reading off the coefficients , in a counter - clockwise order , along each edge of the polygon .",
    "thus @xmath22 above has edge polynomials @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "following  @xcite , we say that @xmath22 is _ tempered _ if all the edge polynomials are cyclotomic ; i.e.  if their roots consist solely of roots of unity .",
    "we next present our objects of study .",
    "we say that a polynomial @xmath41 $ ] is _ parametrizable _ if it is irreducible and there exist rational functions @xmath4 which parametrize the curve , i.e.  provide a bijection ( except at singular points ) between @xmath42 and the projective curve defined by  @xmath9 via the correspondence @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , @xmath44 should be identically zero .",
    "in other words , @xmath22 must define a rational curve .    in the case of parametrizable polynomials ,",
    "the link between mahler measure and other areas of mathematics is provided by the bloch-@xmath8wigner dilogarithm , which we briefly introduce .",
    "it may be defined as @xmath45 unlike the standard dilogarithm function  @xmath46 , the bloch-@xmath8wigner dilogarithm ( which we shorten to just ` the dilogarithm ' from here on ) may be extended to a function on  @xmath42 , vanishing on the real axis and at infinity .",
    "it is real analytic except at @xmath47 , 1 , and  @xmath48 , where it is merely continuous .",
    "the dilogarithm is invariant under the group of six transformations generated by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and satisfies @xmath51 as well .",
    "there is also an analogue to abel s five - term identity for  @xmath46 , namely @xmath52 for any @xmath53 .",
    "( see  @xcite for a more comprehensive introduction to this function . )",
    "the dilogarithm will play a role in evaluating mahler measure since it appears as the primitive of a certain differential , which will enable us to complete the integration appearing in the definition .",
    "techniques for determining @xmath0 for particular types of parametrizable polynomials have been developed by various authors , including smyth  @xcite , maillot  @xcite , and rodriguez villegas  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this section is to present a systematic way of evaluating @xmath0 for any such polynomial .",
    "our approach closely follows the treatment in  @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath22 has degree  @xmath54 as a polynomial in  @xmath37 and that the coefficient of  @xmath55 is  @xmath56 .",
    "when @xmath57 we can write @xmath58 where the @xmath59 catalog the @xmath54 roots of @xmath22 for a fixed value of  @xmath36 .",
    "one may then integrate @xmath60 with respect to @xmath37 using jensen s formula : @xmath61 this equality is not valid for the finitely many values of  @xmath62 where @xmath63 , but this does not affect our computation of @xmath0 since we will subsequently be integrating the above expression with respect to  @xmath36 . according to the definition of mahler measure we have @xmath64",
    "the last equality stems from the fact that @xmath65 is real while @xmath66 is pure imaginary for @xmath62 , as may be seen by taking @xmath67 .    rather than",
    "keep track of each of the @xmath54 roots separately with the functions  @xmath68 , we adopt the following more unified approach .",
    "let @xmath69 be the projective curve defined by @xmath70 .",
    "( by slight abuse of notation , we will continue to refer to the affine coordinates of points on  @xmath69 . )",
    "then the set of all points on  @xmath69 for which @xmath71 will consist of one or more closed loops , which we orient compatibly ( via the @xmath36-coordinate ) with the usual orientation of  @xmath72 .",
    "clearly the values of the @xmath37-coordinates are the same as the values of  @xmath68 .",
    "( observe that points at infinity on  @xmath69 occur precisely when @xmath63 for @xmath71 . ) now suppose that @xmath22 is parametrizable via @xmath73 for rational functions @xmath74 and  @xmath75 , and let @xmath76 be the oriented pullback of this set .",
    "then  ( [ xplane ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath77 the presence of the invariant measure  @xmath66 in the definition of mahler measure is crucial to the equality of these two integrals .",
    "because @xmath78 when @xmath79 , we are only interested in values of  @xmath80 for which @xmath81 . therefore let @xmath82 ,  , @xmath83 be the oriented paths which comprise those portions of  @xmath84 .",
    "we denote the initial and terminal points of @xmath85 by @xmath86 and  @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "these endpoints arise from points @xmath88 for which @xmath10 . since these points play an important role in what follows",
    ", we will refer to them as the _ toric points _ of  @xmath22 .",
    "it is also possible that some of the @xmath85 are loops which lie entirely outside the unit circle , in which case any point on the loop may be chosen to serve as both endpoints .",
    "we can now replace @xmath89 by @xmath90 in the above equation , leading to @xmath91    following  @xcite we introduce a closed , real - valued differential 1-form @xmath92 on  @xmath42 for each ordered pair of non - zero rational functions @xmath93 .",
    "it is given by @xmath94 or , equivalently , as @xmath95 as may readily be verified , @xmath96  is bimultiplicative and skew - symmetric in its arguments .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath97 then @xmath98 . we will use the fact that @xmath99 is exact with primitive  @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the bloch - wigner dilogarithm .    since @xmath102 for @xmath103",
    ", we have @xmath104 along this path . therefore the summand of  ( [ logg ] ) can be written as @xmath105 in order to make further progress we utilize an algebraic technique ascribed to tate .",

    "since @xmath74 and @xmath75 have a common pole , there are eight terms in the sum appearing in  ( [ tool ] ) . together with the eight endpoints listed above",
    ", we have a total of sixty - four dilogarithms with which to contend , a somewhat daunting prospect .",
    "fortunately , many of these terms cancel in pairs , while other values occur several times .",
