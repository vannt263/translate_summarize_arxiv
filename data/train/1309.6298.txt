    "indeed , in the above results , the tropical semiring is essentially thought of as the image of the field of complex puiseux series by the valuation .",

    "is an extension of the notion with the same name arising in combinatorial matrix theory , in particular in the study of the permanent problem of plya , see  @xcite for more information .",
    "whereas the results concerning `` balances '' involve the extension of the tropical numbers with signs , we note that other extensions have been used more recently .",
    "in particular , the incorporation of `` phase '' ( instead of sign ) information in tropical constructions has played an important role in the arguments of mikhalkin  @xcite .",
    "moreover , viro introduced a general notion of _ hyperfield _",
    "@xcite with a multivalued addition , which he used in particular to capture the phase information .",
    "the semirings with symmetry introduced by the authors in  @xcite provide another way to encode the sign or phase .",
    "also , different extensions have been provided by the `` supertropical '' structures of izhakian and rowen  @xcite extending the bi - valued tropical semiring introduced by izhakian  @xcite ; in the latter , the goal is not to encode `` sign '' or `` phase '' , but the fact that the maximum in an expression is achieved twice at least .",
    "given the analogy between the `` complex '' and `` real '' versions of the tropical cramer theorem ( theorems  [ th-1 ] and [ th-3 ] above ) , as well as between the unsigned and signed notions of tropical singularity of matrices ( theorems  [ th-2 ] and [ th-4 ] ) , one may ask whether all these results may be derived from common principles .",
    "one may also ask whether results of this kind are valid for more general tropical structures , encoding different kinds of sign or phase information , in the light of recent constructions of extended tropical semirings by viro  @xcite , izhakian and rowen  @xcite , and the authors  @xcite .    in this paper , we answer these questions and deal with related algorithmic issues , by developing a theory of elimination of linear systems over semirings , building on ideas and results of  @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to show that the earlier results are indeed special instances of general cramer type theorems , which apply to various extensions of tropical semirings .",
    "these theorems are established using axioms allowing one to perform `` elimination '' of balances , in a way similar to gaussian elimination . in this way",
    ", we will generalize and sometimes refine ( handling degenerate cases ) earlier results .",
    "also , some of our proofs are based on jacobi or gauss - seidel type iterative schemes , and lead to efficient algorithms . in passing ,",
    "we revisit some of the results of  @xcite , giving their geometric interpretation in terms of signed tropical hyperplanes .",
    "an ingredient of our approach is the introduction ( in section  [ sec - prelim ] ) of a rather general notion of _ extension _ of the tropical semiring , together with a general `` balance '' relation @xmath35 , which , depending on the details of the extension , expresses the fact that the maximum is attained at least twice in an expression , or that the maxima of two collections of terms coincide .",
    "our constructions include as a special case the symmetrized tropical semiring of plus  @xcite and the bi - valued tropical semiring of izhakian  @xcite , but also a certain `` phase extension '' of the tropical semiring , which is a variant of the complex tropical hyperfield of viro .",
    "our notion also includes certain `` supertropical semifields '' in the sense of izhakian and rowen  @xcite .",
    "then auxiliary combinatorial results are presented in section  [ sec - comb ] .",

    "will be required to satisfy certain non - degeneracy conditions , typically that the coordinate of @xmath41 do not belong to the set of balanced non - zero elements of the extension .    in this way , by developing methods of  @xcite , we obtain in section  [ sec - elim ] a general result , theorem  [ th - cramer ] , concerning the unique solvability of non - singular cramer system , which includes theorems  [ th-1 ] and  [ th-3 ] as special cases",
    ".    then we study in section  [ sec - exists ] the existence problem for the solution of the affine cramer system @xmath42 , without making the non - singularity assumptions needed in the previous uniqueness results .",
    "theorem  [ theo - jacobi ] below gives a general existence theorem , with a constructive proof based on the idea of the jacobi algorithm in  @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ theo - gauss - seidel ] gives an alternative gauss - seidel type algorithm .",
    "these results are valid in a large enough class of semirings , including not only the symmetrized tropical semiring as in  @xcite , but also the phase extension of the tropical semiring .    in section",
    "[ sec - homogeneous ] , we deal with the generalization of theorems  [ th-2 ] and  [ th-4 ] which concern singular linear systems of @xmath5 equations in @xmath5 variables . in theorem",
    "[ newtgma ] , we characterize the existence of non - degenerate solutions of @xmath43 , recovering theorems  [ th-2 ] and  [ th-4 ] as special cases .",
    "this extends to more general semirings a theorem of gaubert  @xcite dealing with the case of the symmetrized tropical semiring @xmath25 .",
    "we note however that by comparison with the jacobi / gauss - seidel type results of section  [ sec - exists ] the results of this section hold under more restrictive assumptions on the semiring .",
    "a geometrical interpretation of the previous results , in the case of the symmetrized tropical semiring , is presented in section  [ sec - geom ] .    in section  [ s_ac ] , we start to address computational issues .",
    "the @xmath44 cramer determinants of the system @xmath36 correspond to @xmath44 optimal assignment problems . in section  [ sec - perall ] , we show that our approach based on a jacobi - type iterative method leads to an algorithm to compute the solution , as well as the cramer determinants ( up to signs ) , by solving a single ( rather than @xmath44 ) optimal assignment problem , followed by a single destination shortest path problem . for the sake of comparison , we revisit in section  [ sec - transport ] the approach of richter - gebert , sturmfels and theobald  @xcite , building on results of sturmfels and zelevinsky dealing with minkowski sums of birkhoff polytopes",
    ": it gives a reduction to a different transportation problem .",
    "although the original exposition of  @xcite is limited to instances in general position , we show that some of their results remain valid even without such an assumption .",
