    "very high - rate codes are of great interest for a number of practical applications including data storage and high - speed fiber links .",
    "the design of modern error - correcting codes which simultaneously have very low error floors ( e.g. @xmath0 bit error rate ) and very high rates ( e.g. @xmath1 ) is a particularly challenging problem of practical interest . due to the inherent difficulty of simulating the performance of codes in the very low floor region , the design of such codes relies on the principles of uniform interleaver analysis ( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) . to review , on the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel with binary antipodal signaling , the bit error rate ( @xmath2 ) and codeword error rate ( @xmath3 ) of a large class of modern codes vary asymptotically with block size as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the interleaver size and @xmath6 is the maximum exponent of @xmath5 in an asymptotic union bound approximation .",
    "note that @xmath6 depends on both the specific code construction and constituent codes used .",
    "if the bit ( codeword ) error rate decays with @xmath5 , then the code is said to exhibit interleaver gain in bit ( codeword ) error rate .",
    "designs for codes with low floors require interleaver gain in both bit and codeword error rates thus require @xmath7 .",
    "serially concatenated code ( scc ) constructions ( i.e. codes composed of an inner code and outer code separated by a random - like interleaver ) are well - suited to low - floor design because , provided the inner code is recursive , the maximum exponent of equation [ uniform_int_eqn ] is @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the minimum distance of the outer code .",
    "since the rate of an scc is equal to the product of the rates of its constituent codes , the design of a high - rate , low - floor scc requires a high - rate outer code satisfying @xmath10 .",
    "however , it is very challenging to find such outer codes for which there exist low - complexity optimal siso decoding algorithms .",
    "to this end , graell i amat _ et al .",
    "_ introduced a class of high - rate convolutional codes with optimal siso decoding algorithms of moderate complexity based on their dual codes @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to the design of high - rate low - floor codes are the systematic with serially concatenated parity ( s - scp ) codes proposed in @xcite , of which jin _",
    "et al . _ s generalized repeat accumulate ( gra ) codes @xcite are an example . the s - scp code structure can be viewed as a systematic code with a parity generating concatenated system that resembles an scc .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that s - scp codes have the same maximum error exponent and design rules as sccs : codes constructed with a parity generating system composed of a recursive inner parity generator and an outer code satisfying @xmath10 achieve interleaver gain in both bit and codeword error rates .",
    "in contrast to sccs , good s - scps can be constructed with inner parity generators that have rate greater than @xmath11 so that the rate of outer code can be _ lower _ than the overall code rate thus alleviating the aforementioned challenge of finding high - rate , @xmath10 outer codes with low - complexity siso decoding algorithms .",
    "the design of good high - rate , low - floor codes has thus been largely solved for the awgn channel . however , the s - scp design philosophy is not directly applicable to the large class of systems which have recursive channels . the term _ recursive channel _ is introduced to describe systems in which the aggregate of the modulation and ( possible ) precoding with the channel is recursive .",
    "continuous phase modulations over awgn and fading channels as well as certain models for precoded magnetic recoding channels ( e.g. epr4 @xcite ) are examples of recursive channels .    in light of the above discussion",
    ", high - rate , low - floor codes for use in systems with recursive channels can be constructed via the serial concatenation of a high - rate code and the channel ( where the recursive channel is treated like an inner code ) .",
    "the outer high - rate code can be a modern ( e.g. scc or s - scp ) code or a classical ( e.g. algebraic or convolutional ) code .",
    "classical outer codes are more attractive , however , for application in practical systems .",
    "specifically , the use of a classical outer code for which there exists a simple non - iterative siso decoding algorithm offers reductions in decoding complexity , decoding latency , and required memory with respect to a modern , iteratively decoded outer code . as with the design of sccs for the awgn channel , the design of such codes requires a high - rate , @xmath12 outer classical code for which there exists a low - complexity optimal siso decoding algorithm .    to this end",
    ", the present work introduces novel low - complexity siso decoding algorithms for the family of first - order reed - muller codes ( and hence their duals , the extended hamming codes @xcite ) in section [ rm_ex_sec ] based on variable conditioning in generalized tanner graphs ( gtgs ) , which are defined in section [ gtg_sec ] .",
    "it is shown in section [ tlc_app_sec ] that extended hamming codes offer an attractive alternative to the high - rate convolutional codes studied in @xcite for use as outer codes in serial concatenation with recursive inner channels . concluding remarks are given in section [ conc_sec ] .",
