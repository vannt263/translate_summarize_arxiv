    "broad absorption lines ( bals ) in quasar spectra identify a dynamic but still mysterious component quasar environments .",
    "these features clearly form in high velocity winds from the central engines , with maximum speeds of typically 10,000 km s@xmath4 to 30,000 km s@xmath4 , but many fundamental questions remain .",
    "for example , what are the total absorbing column densities ?",
    "recent x - ray studies have shown that the columns are typically large , in the range @xmath5 to 10@xmath6 @xmath2 , but how much of that column density is actually outflowing with the uv absorption - line gas ? are the flows radiatively accelerated ?",
    "what is the geometry , location and  launch radius \" of the flows , e.g. , with respect to the accretion disk and emission line regions ?",
    "what are the mass loss rates ? what are the elemental abundances , ionizations , space densities , volume filling factors , etc . of the absorbing gas ?    the most fundamental source of uncertainty ( and confusion ) in the analysis of bal winds is the column densities . for a fully resolved absorption line that completely covers the emission source(s ) along our line(s ) of sight , the measured flux across the line profile , @xmath7 , depends on the optical depth profile , @xmath8 , by , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the  continuum \" flux ( which may include line emission ) .",
    "this relationship ignores scattered / emitted flux from the absorbing region itself , but that contribution is generally considered to be small for bal winds with small global covering factors ( @xmath11 , cf .",
    "hamann et al .",
    "the column density in the measured ion is then , @xmath12 .",
    "this analysis applied to the usual uv bals , such as ly@xmath13 , n v @xmath01238,1242 , si iv @xmath01393,1404 and c iv @xmath01549,1551 , yields total column densities of typically @xmath14 @xmath2  much lower than those mentioned above based on x - ray observations .",
    "more surprisingly , this analysis leads to bizarre elemental abundance ratios , such as , [ si / c ] @xmath15 0.5 and [ c / h ] @xmath16 to 2 ( where [ @xmath17 = @xmath18 ) . the surprising detections of p v @xmath01118,1128 bals in sources imply [ p / c ] @xmath19 1.6 ( see turnshek 1988 , junkkarinen et al .",
    "1997 , hamann et al .",
    "1993 , hamann 1998 , and reference therein ) .",
    "how can we understand these strange abundances and reconcile the vastly different uv and x - ray column densities ?",
    "one very reasonable possibility is that the uv and x - ray absorbers are distinct .",
    "the large column density of x - ray absorbing gas might not be outflowing along with the bal wind . perhaps it is more or less stationary in the quasar rest frame , and the bal gas is accelerated at larger radii downstream from the x - ray absorber ( e.g. , murray et al .",
    "this situation could explain vastly different uv and x - ray absorbing columns , but it can not explain the strange abundance ratios .",
    "another possibility is that the analysis of the bals outlined above is simply incorrect ( or incomplete ) . in particular , there is growing evidence that bal column densities are underestimated by this analysis because of partial coverage of the background light source(s ) .",
    "there is unabsorbed flux filling in the bottoms of bal troughs , and so the line profiles are _ not _ simply related to the optical depth by , @xmath20 .",
    "direct evidence for partial coverage in bals has come from comparisons of line pairs in one balqso ( arav et al .",
    "indirect evidence comes from flat - bottomed troughs that do not reach zero intensity , and from the growing numbers of intrinsic  mini - bals \" and narrow absorption lines ( nals ) whose resolved doublet ratios ( e.g. , in c iv ) frequently require partial coverage ( hamann et al .",
    "1997 , barlow , hamann & sargent 1997 , arav et al . 1999 ,",
    "telfer et al . 1998 ) .",
    "changes in the percent polarization across bal profiles ( e.g. , schmidt & hines 1999 ) might also indicate partial coverage , in this case because of reflected continuum and/or line emission .",
    "hamann ( 1998 ) argued that the surprisingly strong p v bals are also evidence for partial coverage .",
    "the c iv and p v lines form under vary similar physical conditions and their ratio leads trivially to a lower limit on [ p / c ] . in the sun , phosphorus is @xmath211000 times less abundant than carbon . with this abundance ratio , the optical depth in p v",
    "should be at least @xmath21500 times less than c iv .",
    "therefore , if the relative abundances are even close to solar , e.g. [ p / c ] @xmath22 0 , the p v line should not be present in balqso spectra _ unless _ c iv and other strong lines of abundant elements ( such as o vi @xmath01031,1038 ) are very optically thick .",
    "the optical depths and column densities turn out to be much larger than one would generally derive from the naive analysis of bals outlined above .",
    "below we discuss the implications of large column densities for bal winds .",
    "we first summarize the findings from a detailed analysis of uv + x - ray absorption in a particular balqso , pg  1254 + 047 ( hamann 1998 , sabra et al .",
    "then we discuss some preliminary results from an ongoing study of a larger balqso sample ( junkkarinen et al .",
    "pg  1254 + 047 ( @xmath23 ) is particularly interesting because it has ",
    "detached \" bal troughs ; in other words , there is no absorption near the quasar emission redshift ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the bals identify a wind that intersects our line(s ) of sight _ only _ at high blueshifted velocities , from roughly 15,000 to 27,000 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the strong x - ray absorption in this source ( see below ) must either be outflowing at the same high speeds as the bal gas , or at rest ( or at lower speeds ) but producing no significant uv absorption lines . either way",
    ", we have additional strong constraints on the nature of the bal wind .",
    "hamann ( 1998 ) measured a p v bal in pg  1254 + 047 whose strength compared to the c iv absorption suggests [ p / c ] @xmath19 2.2 by the analysis in  1 ( assuming complete line - of - sight coverage ) .",
    "the data do not provide direct evidence for partial coverage .",
    "however , by making the reasonable assumption that the relative metal abundances are _ roughly _ solar ( e.g. [ p / c ] @xmath24 ) , hamann ( 1998 ) used photoionization calculations to show that the line optical depths are much larger than one would infer simply from the depths of the observed troughs (  1 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath8(c iv ) @xmath19 25 and @xmath8(o vi ) @xmath19 60 . the total column density needed to produce the measured p v is at least @xmath25 @xmath2 if the overall metallicity is also solar . there is also a lower limit on the ionization parameter ( i.e. , the dimensionless ratio of hydrogen - ionizing photon to hydrogen particle densities at the illuminated face of the absorbing clouds ) of @xmath26 , based on the absence of low - ionization bals , such as mg ii @xmath02796,2804",
    ". the total column density could be substantially larger if the gas is more highly ionized .",
    "in particular , the outflowing gas could have @xmath27 @xmath2 if @xmath28 . the upper limit on the ionization and",
    "therefore the column density are unknown .",
    "figure 7 in hamann ( 1998 ) shows the permitted range of @xmath29 values as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "more recent chandra x - ray observations by sabra et al .",
    "( 2001 , see also sabra & hamann this proceedings ) show that , like other balqsos , pg  1254 + 047 is also severely absorbed in soft x - rays .",
    "sabra et al .",
    "derive a total column density in x - ray absorbing gas of @xmath31 @xmath2 if @xmath28 .",
    "( it is not possible to simultaneously derive @xmath29 and @xmath30 from the existing x - ray spectrum with only @xmath2147 counts ; however , an ionized absorber does seem to fit the data better than a neutral one . )",
    "the important point here is that the total column density suppressing the x - rays is consistent with the heavily saturated bals .",
    "how common is this result ?",
    "to understand the frequency of p v absorption in balqsos , we have obtained rest - frame uv spectra for a small sample of 8 balqsos using the hubble space telescope ( hst , junkkarinen et al .",
    "the sample consists of bright sources with moderate redshifts ( so p v @xmath01118,1128 is shifted into the hst wavelength range while avoiding severe contamination by the ly@xmath13 forest that would occur at higher redshifts ) .",
    "we also tried to select balqsos with relatively narrow line components , so that we can use the multiplet ratio @xmath321118/@xmath321128 in p v to diagnose directly the amount of saturation in these lines . to increase the sample size",
    ", we also include spectra from the hst archives of several other balqsos .",
    "importantly , all of the spectra were obtained without any prejudice regarding the p v line strength .",
    "finally , we have proposed to obtain x - ray spectra for some of the balqsos in this sample to compare directly their uv and x - ray absorbing properties .",
    "the hst spectra are currently under analysis .",
    "detections of the p v bals can be hampered by blending with nearby lines , such as o vi and c iii @xmath32977 .",
    "nonetheless , a preliminary review of the data indicates that broad p v absorption is present in at least 50% of the measured sources . with the assumption that",
    "p / c is roughly solar , we again note that the optical depths in p v should be at least 500 times lower than c iv .",
    "our tentative conclusion is that saturation is common in the strong lines of abundant species , such as c iv , n v and o vi , and therefore , by analogy with pg  1254 + 047 above , the total column densities in bal winds are frequently greater than @xmath33 @xmath2 .",
    "large column densities in outflowing bal gas place strong constraints on wind models that employ radiative acceleration .",
    "the equation of motion for a radial wind emanating from a point source can be written as , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the wind velocity at radius @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the central black hole mass , @xmath38 is the quasar luminosity , and @xmath39 is the fraction of the incident flux that is absorbed or scattered by the wind ( along a given line of sight ) . integrating this expression from an initial  launch \" radius to infinity yields the terminal velocity : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the launch radius in units of 0.1 pc , @xmath42 is the absorption fraction relative to 10% , @xmath43 is the luminosity relative to @xmath44 ergs / s , @xmath45 is the column density relative to @xmath33 @xmath2 , and @xmath46 is the black hole mass relative to @xmath47 m@xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 is the eddington luminosity for a mass @xmath50 , and @xmath51 should be roughly appropriate for normal high - ionization balqsos ( hamann 1998 ) .",
    "bal winds with total column densities of order @xmath52 @xmath2 ( @xmath53 ) should have no trouble reaching a typical terminal velocity of 15,000 to 20,000 km / s , as long as the launch radius is @xmath54 cm ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "however , if the outflows have @xmath56 @xmath2 ( @xmath57 ) , which is comparable to the x - ray results and consistent with the measured bals in pg  1254 + 047 ( see above ) , then the radiative force might be too small to overcome gravity at any launch radius . a gas with @xmath58 and this total column would remain gravitationally bound to the black hole .",
    "even if we ignore gravity for a moment , the launch radius of a flow with @xmath56 @xmath2 must be very small , @xmath59 cm , to reach the observed terminal velocities .",
    "this small launch radius would not seem to be a problem , except that the bal gas is supposed to reside outside of ( at larger radii than ) the broad emission line region ( belr ) .",
    "the main evidence for this statement comes from observations of n v bals that clearly absorb the underlying ly@xmath13 bel whenever wind material appears at the right flow velocity ( @xmath215900 km / s ) . in a small fraction of cases , where there is deep absorption setting in abruptly near the bel rest velocity",
    ", it is again clear that the bal wind absorbs both the continuum and broad line radiation .",
    "the radius of the ly@xmath13 and/or c iv belr , @xmath60 , therefore sets a minimum radius for the observed bal wind , @xmath61 , such that , @xmath62 where the estimate of @xmath60 comes from variability studies ( kaspi et al .",
    "we emphasize that this limit applies to the _ observed _ bal wind radius because the launch radius might be smaller . certainly in pg  1254 + 046 ( and other balqsos with detached troughs ) , the wind is launched somewhere out of our line(s ) of sight to the emission sources ( requiring a non - radial velocity component  see the sketches in ganguly et al .",
    "2001 and elvis 2000 ) . by the time the wind intersects our sightline(s ) , it is already travelling at speeds @xmath6315,000 km / s .",
    "a similar situation explain the sources with deep bal absorption near the rest velocity , in this case requiring a geometry where the highest observed wind speeds occur at the smallest radii . in any case , it is not really clear what plausible wind geometry could allow a launch radius that is 10 or more times smaller than the observed bal region radius .",
    "moreover , as we noted above , bal winds with column densities of order @xmath3 @xmath2 might be gravitationally bound no matter the launch radius . if the outflowing column densities do prove to be this large , some other mechanism is likely contributing to the acceleration ( e.g. , emmering et al .",
