    "although we seem to understand reasonably well how low mass stars form by cloud collapse and disc accretion , the question of whether high mass stars form in the same way remains completely open . on the one hand",
    ", theoretical efforts are being undertaken to realise the formation of high mass stars through disc accretion ( e.g. behrend & maeder 2001 ) .",
    "on the other hand , others perform calculations for the formation of high mass stars by stellar collisions and mergers in a dense cluster environment ( e.g. bonnell , bate & zinnecker 1998 ) .",
    "these collision scenarios are invoked because high mass star formation through disc accretion encounters the problem that radiation pressure forces on gas and dust may be able to reverse the infall , preventing the formation of stars with masses larger than 10 m@xmath1(york & kruegel 1977 ) .    in addressing the question as to whether accretion discs around high mass stars",
    "are present , the intermediate mass ( 2  15 m@xmath1 ) pre - main sequence herbig ae / be stars ( herbig 1960 ) play a crucial role , as these objects are the only higher mass pre - main sequence stars that are visible at optical and infrared wavelengths . yet ,",
    "whether or not herbig ae",
    "/ be stars are embedded in accretion discs has not been determined .",
    "although there is clear - cut evidence for the presence of circumstellar gas and dust ( see e.g. waters & waelkens 1998 ) , there is no consensus on the _ geometry _ of this material ( see e.g. pezzuto , strafella & lorenzetti 1997 for a summary of conflicting views ) . ideally one would like to solve this issue by directly imaging the environments around these objects .",
    "although there are indications that some intermediate mass stars present geometries deviating from spherical symmetry ( e.g. mannings & sargent 1997 ; grady et al . 1999 ; shepherd , claussen & kurtz 2001 ) , the conclusions reached are sometimes contradictory .",
    "for instance in the case of ab  aur , the brightest and best - studied herbig ae / be star , mannings & sargent infer an almost edge - on geometry , i  =  76@xmath2 , while grady et al .",
    "claim i  @xmath3  45@xmath2 . furthermore ,",
    "most of these imaging studies have been performed in the millimetre and radio regimes , probing the geometry on a relatively large scale , between about 100  1000 au . to make progress in the area of star formation for the higher mass stars , observations exploring the innermost regions around these objects are badly needed . until sub - milli - arcsecond imaging becomes a reality , linear spectropolarimetry across emission lines such as h@xmath0 is the most powerful technique for doing so , as the scattering of starlight on electrons in an ionised medium occurs within a few stellar radii ( rudy 1978 ; cassinelli , nordsieck , & murison , 1987 ) .",
    "this application of spectropolarimetry was first established in studies of classical be stars ( clarke & mclean 1974 ; poeckert 1975 ) . in its simplest form , it is based on the expectation that h@xmath0 photons arise over a much larger volume than the stellar continuum photons . for this reason the line photons undergo fewer scatterings off e.g. a circumstellar disc than the continuum photons",
    "consequently the emission line flux will be much less polarised than the continuum .",
    "in this situation , a change in polarisation across the line profile is expected  we refer to this _ de_polarisation as the classical line effect ( because of its first appearance in observations of classical be stars ) .",
    "the high incidence of these line depolarisations among members of this object class ( 26 out of 44 in poeckert & marlborough 1976 ) indicated that the envelopes of classical be stars are not spherically symmetric .",
    "these findings are now taken as compelling evidence that classical be stars are embedded in circumstellar discs ( see e.g. waters & marlborough 1992 ) .    since then , h@xmath0 spectropolarimetry has been performed on a variety of other strong line emitting objects , such as b[e ] stars ( zickgraf & schulte - ladbeck 1989 ; magalh@xmath4es et al .",
    "1992 ) , luminous blue variables ( e.g. schulte - ladbeck et al .",
    "1994 ) , novae ( bjorkman et al . 1994 ) and supernovae ( e.g. cropper et al . 1988 ) .",
    "in the case of pre - main sequence stars the technique has recently been applied to a sample of 9 herbig be stars by oudmaijer & drew ( 1999 ; hereafter od99 ) .",
    "the main outcome of this pilot study was that a line effect was detected in about half the herbig be stars .",
    "it is possible that the od99 detection rate is consistent with discs around all these stars being viewed at angles ranging from face - on to edge - on . but to be able to make a proper distinction between viewing angle and intrinsic geometry effects , one needs to obtain a larger sample .",
    "we pursue this goal by increasing the sample of spectropolarimetric data to about 25 herbig stars in total .",
    "in addition to increasing the sample , we extend our data set toward the later spectral type herbig ae ( hae ) stars , where we may be able to detect spectropolarimetry characteristics differing from the earlier type herbig be ( hbe ) stars . a switch in phenomenology",
    "may be expected to occur at some point working down the stellar mass range , as different physical mechanisms are likely to play a role at different spectral types .",
    "for instance , radiation pressure forces are likely to play a role for the higher luminosity stars at the early b types , whereas magnetic fields may become more dynamically prominent at the later a types . the magnetically - channelled accretion model ( ghosh & lamb 1979 ) that is commonly applied to the lowest mass pre - main - sequence t  tauri stars ( by e.g. bouvier , forestini , & allain , 1997 ) may also be a suitable model as early as spectral type a ( pontefract et al .",
    "if it does operate , the inner accretion disc around the star is truncated by the magnetic field , and the depolarisation effect may then be absent because the inner hole will necessarily lead to reduced intrinsic continuum polarisation .",
    "alternatively , the channelled accretion may produce a relatively bright and compact source of h@xmath0 emission that may be scattered within the accretion column itself or within the disrupted disc .",
    "this in turn may yield a polarisation signature at h@xmath0 that is more complex than the simple depolarisation effect ( see mclean 1979 ; wood , brown & fox 1993 ) .",
    "the second goal of this paper is accordingly to explore how the h@xmath0 spectropolarimetric signature behaves as a function of herbig star spectral type .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "[ s_obs ] we discuss the way in which our sample was selected , how the observations were performed , and reduced . in sect .",

    "the discussion of individual targets is performed in the next section ( sect .",
    "[ s_ind ] ) .",
    "the linear polarisation of herbig ae / be star continua can be attributed to the scattering of stellar photons off matter within an asymmetric circumstellar geometry .",
    "in addition there may be a substantial interstellar contribution .",
    "it is not yet settled which polarigenic agent causes the circumstellar polarisation , but the most likely candidates are dust particles and electrons . whilst the resolution of this question is both interesting and significant ,",
    "we leave it for the future , given our present focus on the implications of the line polarisation morphology for the circumstellar geometry .",
    "the measured continuum polarisations for both the hbes and haes are summarised in table  [ t_cont ] .",
    "the mean percentage polarisation and position angle obtained for each object appear in columns ( 7 ) and ( 8) .",
    "in addition , for cases where an excursion in @xmath8 space ( see later ) is present , we estimate the sky pa from these line excursions , and present them in column ( 9 ) for completeness .",
    "( note that the presumed discs are supposed to lie perpendicular to these sky pa estimates ) .",
    "polarisation variability is a well - known and common phenomenon ( vrba , schmidt & hintzen , 1979 ; grinin 1994 ) . in general terms",
    ", it is viewed as caused by time variable amounts and/or projected distributions of circumstellar gas and dust .",
    "accordingly we do not look for perfect agreement between our continuum polarisation measurements and those in earlier literature .",
    "nevertheless , the values of the polarisation quantities , % pol and pa , are generally consistent with previous continuum measurements in the r band ( petrova & shevchenko 1987 ; jain & bhatt 1995 ; od99 ; and oudmaijer et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the observed h@xmath0  characteristics of each herbig star are listed in table  [ t_line ] .",
    "the first few columns list the h@xmath0  parameters deducible from the `` intensity '' ( stokes i ) profile only , namely the equivalent width ( ew ; column 2 ) and the ratio of the peak line counts over the continuum counts ( column 3 ) .",
    "these parameters can be used as indicators for the amount of ionised gas in the environments of these objects .",
    "as one would expect , these quantities show a general decline toward later spectral types .",
    "the spectroscopic line shapes of the herbig stars vary from pure emission , double - peaked emission , p cygni type , through to inverse p cygni type .",
    "we will see later that these spectroscopic line profiles do not necessarily correlate with the spectropolarimetry .",
    "in fact , spectropolarimetric behaviour seems to be rather more homogeneous than stokes i spectroscopy .",
    "this is illustrative of how the polarised light contribution to the total light has a more selective scattering origin .",
    "it is an independent dimension of information on the source geometry . in other words ,",
    "spectropolarimetric line profiles offer the opportunity to study physical phenomena that are unobservable in normal spectroscopy",
    ".    columns ( 4 ) to ( 8) in the table concern spectropolarimetric properties",
    ". plots of the spectropolarimetric data for the herbig ae / be stars are presented in the different panels of figs .",
    "[ f_hbe ] and [ f_hae ] . for all objects",
    "the polarisation spectra are presented as triplots ( consisting of stokes i , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ) , as well as loci in @xmath8 space .      consider a star embedded in an at least partly ionised circumstellar medium .",
    "if ( part of ) the h@xmath0  photons are formed over a large volume , and the projected distribution of thomson - scattering free electrons is sufficiently flattened on the sky , the line emission itself is unpolarised while the continuum shows some linear polarisation .",
    "one may then expect to detect a depolarisation line effect ( as found in classical be stars ) .",
    "where this happens one would expect to see a change in % pol across the line that more or less `` follows '' the shape of the stokes i intensity profile .",
    "hence the polarisation change is expected to be as broad as the line emission itself ( see the middle panel of the triplot sketch in fig .",
    "[ f_depolariz ] ) . in this case",
    "the depolarisation across h@xmath0  is only seen in the % pol , but in practise ( due to the vector addition of the foreground polarisation ) , it may be observable in the pa as well or instead . in any case , when mapped onto @xmath8 space , the line wavelength points will emerge from the continuum knot as a linear excursion ( as seen in the @xmath8 plane sketch of fig .",
    "[ f_depolariz ] ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , ( part of ) the h@xmath0  line photons originate from a _ compact _ rather than an extended source , one may pick out more subtle line effects , as have for instance been modelled by wood et al .",
    "( 1993 ; see also mclean 1979 ) . in the presence of a compact h@xmath0  source",
    "one can envision a variety of line effects that will map into @xmath8 space in as many ways .",
    "the patterns seen will depend on the specific geometry and bulk motions of the scattering particles surrounding the compact h@xmath0   source .",
    "if the scattering occurs predominantly in a rotating disc - like configuration , the subsequent breaking of left - right reflection symmetry in the velocity field leads to a changing pa with wavelength ( mclean 1979 ) , which appears as a `` loop '' in @xmath8 space ( see the cartoon in fig .  [ f_intr ] ) .",
    "if the scattering however occurs in an expanding ( as opposed to a rotating ) medium , there is no breaking of the left - right symmetry , and the track in @xmath8 space will appear to be more `` linear '' . in case of a rotating _ and _ an expanding medium , the tracks in @xmath8 space are expected to appear as a combination of the two and thus be more or less `` hook - shaped '' ( see schulte - ladbeck et al .",
    "1994 ; oudmaijer et al .",
    "1998 ) . in all of these compact h@xmath0  cases",
    "there is the possibility that the width of the polarisation profile across h@xmath0  does not coincide with the width of the stokes i intensity profile ( see the triplot sketch in fig .",
    "[ f_intr ] ) .    finally , where the geometry on the sky is circular , as is the case for either spherically symmetric geometry or a face - on disc , there is no change in pa and/or % pol across the line . in this circumstance and in the ideal limits of noiseless data and",
    "no wavelength dependence of foreground polarisation , all points in @xmath8 space would collapse into a single `` dot '' ( see fig .",
    "[ f_noline ] ) . for some objects described below there is no h@xmath0  line effect apparent in the triplot , but yet due to polarisation changes in the continuum or broad photospheric absorption wings the `` dot '' smears to a short fuzzy line , called a `` smear '' .      inspecting the different objects in figs .",
    "[ f_hbe ] and  [ f_hae ] one finds a range of morphology in the polarisation spectra ( triplots ) , as well as in the @xmath8 plots .",
    "most importantly , 15 out of the 22 herbig stars show a clear variation across the h@xmath0  line .",
    "( the only objects that do definitely not show any changes across h@xmath0  at all in our data are il  cep , mwc  758 , and hd  35929 ) . the question whether or not a line effect is present or not is answered qualitatively in column ( 4 ) of table  [ t_line ] . the high number of line effect detections is interesting in its own right , given that any polarisation change across a line indicates scattering off a geometry , that , in projection on the sky , deviates from spherical symmetry .",
    "although the morphology in both the polarisation triplots and @xmath8 space shows some variety , we will classify them according to their common characteristics . to this end",
    ", we have developed several tools to characterise the line effects .",
    "one such tool involves the fractional line width over which the polarisation changes ( see data in columns 5 and 6 in table  [ t_line ] ) . in cases where the widths of the pa and % pol changes are unequal , we choose the largest in specifying the change @xmath11 ( column 5 ) .",
    "this then is divided by the width of stokes i , @xmath12 to yield a dimensionless measure of polarisation width ( column 6 ) .",
    "note that both @xmath13 and @xmath12 are measured at full width ",
    "zero intensity ( fwzi ) .    the other , more qualitative , tool concerns the _ shape _ of the polarisation change across the line ( columns 7 and 8) . whether or not the change in polarisation across h@xmath0  is consistent with the depolarisation mechanism is noted in column ( 7 ) .",
    "to limit our subjectivity , we have constructed a recipe for answering this question that proceeds as follows .",
    "first , the line effect needs to be broad enough to be consistent with a depolarisation .",
    "if the ratio ( @xmath14 )  is smaller than a value of 0.75 we claim that the line effect is not consistent with the depolarisation mechanism , and the answer in column ( 7 ) is simply a `` no '' .",
    "if however , the ratio ( @xmath14 )  has a value larger than 0.75 , the polarisation change could indeed be due to depolarisation , but not necessarily .",
    "we therefore employ a second criterion that takes into account the finer details of the line effects . in many cases a so - called `` flip '' in pa and/or",
    "% pol   across the line will be clearly noticeable . in case",
    "this occurs the line effect can not be due to depolarisation and the answer in column ( 7 ) should also be `` no '' .",
    "if , on the other hand the behaviour in % pol   and/or pa is monotonic , and ( @xmath14 )  is larger than 0.75 , the answer to the question `` is the line effect due to depolarisation ? '' can be answered convincingly with a `` yes '' .    as the shapes of the line polarisations are so nicely represented as loci in @xmath8 space",
    ", we also classify the @xmath8 plane morphologies .",
    "these are given in column ( 8) of table  [ t_line ] . in every case",
    "we expect there to be a dark knot of points that arises from the sampling of the continuum polarisation . where the morphology also includes a rounded loop the term `` loop '' appears in column ( 8) of table  [ t_line ] .",
    "the word `` dot '' is given when no line effect is present , and finally in case there is a more or less linear excursion arising from the continuum knot , we refer to this excursion with `` exc '' .",
    "for convenience , the spectral types of the objects are listed in column ( 9 ) .",
    "first , we add to od99 s sample of herbig be stars ( sect .  [ s_hbe ] ) , and then we turn attention to the later - type , and presumably less - massive herbig ae stars ( sect .  [ s_hae ] ) .",
    "a comparison between the spectropolarimetric signatures of hae and hbe stars is made in sect .",
    "[ s_diff ] .",
    "the h@xmath0  line profile data obtained for the herbig be stars are presented in fig .",
    "[ f_hbe ] .",
    "six out of eight hbe stars in fig .",
    "[ f_hbe ] show a clear line effect , whereas only two cases ( il  cep and mwc  166 ) do not show a line effect at all .",
    "note that two stars ( mwc  158 and as  477 ) are not included in this statistics , for reasons discussed later on .",
    "the size of this sample can be increased by including the data on the hbes from od99 .",
    "the sample of herbig be stars in od99 consists of nine hbe stars , of which four stars are in common with the present study , which would leave us with five hbes to be added to the eight in the current study .",
    "however the number of photons counts for lk h@xmath0  218 is regarded as insufficient and the object is thus dropped , leaving us with a total of ( 8 + 4 ) 12 hbes . as these four added hbes from od99 , namely v380  ori , @xmath15  ori , gu  cma and mwc  297 are all cases of no discernible polarisation changes across the line , we would find that 6 out of 12 herbig b stars show a line effect .",
    "but , as the od99 and the current data were obtained at different epochs , spectropolarimetric changes may be seen in the targets common to both studies .",
    "we omit a discussion of such variability in this paper , but note that most of the objects in od99 classified as having a line effect exhibit one here as well . yet",
    ", there is an exception . in the case of mwc  166 ( hd  53367 )",
    "the line effect noted by od99 has disappeared . although there is the possibility that what was once a detectably flattened circumstellar geometry has become more circular in projection onto the sky , it is more likely that the change is due to a reduced amount of ionised particles .",
    "given that the new data show a large fall in the h@xmath0  equivalent width ( now @xmath162.8  rather than @xmath1614  as in od99 ) , it is likely that the reduced ionisation level resulted in fewer electron scatterings .",
    "adding mwc  166 as a line effect case , we finally find that 7 out of 12 hbe stars show a line effect .",
    "this incidence of line effects among the hbe objects may be compatible with a picture in which all hbes are embedded in flattened geometries on small scales .",
    "the explanation for the non - detections is then simply the consequence of an expected number of close to face - on - viewing angles , liable to produce too weak a polarisation to be detected .",
    "let us briefly discuss the polarisation spectra ( and @xmath8 diagrams ) of all the herbig be stars , as displayed in the different panels in fig .",
    "[ f_hbe ] .",
    "* objects showing a depolarisation : *  _ mwc  137 , mwc  1080 , bd+40 4124 and mwc  361_. these are all objects where at h@xmath0 at least one of the two polarisation signatures  as presented by % pol and/or pa  follows the shape of the stokes i line profile monotonically .",
    "the width over which the polarisation change occurs is also relatively broad , resulting in a ratio ( @xmath14 )  larger than 0.75 .",
    "therefore these objects may indeed be interpreted as undergoing a line depolarisation associated with continuum polarisation caused by scattering off an ionised disc on small spatial scales . in the case of mwc  137 , with its exceptionally high line / continuum contrast",
    ", the ripple correction ( derived from the continuum ) may not have been good enough to remove all ripple from the polarisation spectrum , as seems to be the case near line centre in both the % pol and pa spectra .",
    "this deficiency is responsible for the chaotic appearance of the @xmath8 plane excursion . yet , as the shape of the pa clearly follows the stokes i line , the object can surely be regarded as being subject to depolarisation .",
    "the % pol in the spectrum of mwc  1080 follows the shape of the stokes i line profile , and the object can thus also be considered as an example of depolarisation . for this object the @xmath8 diagram does not yield much additional information because of the smear of points due to the changing continuum polarisation . for bd+40  4124 both the pa and the % pol",
    "follow the intensity profile , consistent with the depolarisation picture .",
    "although the % pol of mwc  361 shows a classical depolarisation across the line , the change in pa is rather less straightforward .",
    "specifically , the blue wing does not show any sign of a change in pa , while the innermost red wing shows a flip and then a return to the local continuum pa in the far wing .",
    "we come back to this unusual case in the discussion in sect .",
    "[ s_disc ] .",
    "* objects showing a complex line effect : *  _ mwc  147 and hd  58647_. the late b type objects mwc  147 and hd  58647 both show polarisation changes wherein ( @xmath14 )  is significantly smaller than 1 .",
    "also , in the @xmath8 plane the polarisation changes across the line do not present as simple linear excursions .",
    "* objects showing no clear line effect : *  _ il  cep , mwc  166 , as  477_. in a few cases we must classify the b star as not showing a line effect . in the case of il  cep",

    "therefore we do not regard this object in our statistics and place a question mark in column ( 4 ) against this star in table  [ t_line ] . note that for mwc  166 one may possibly believe that there is a residual polarisation change across the line , but we view the change as too narrow to be credible . +      the spectropolarimetric data for the haes are presented in fig .",
    "[ f_hae ] .",
    "the first thing that is striking is the  perhaps unexpected  high number of line effects , namely in 9 out of the 11 targets for which the data quality allows sufficient definition .",
    "this is even higher than for the hbe sample .",
    "furthermore , there seems to be a difference in the character of the polarisation changes compared to those seen in the hbe stars . as for the hbe stars ,",

    "both are objects where the h@xmath0  line profile includes a blueshifted absorption component : it is this part of the line profile that maps onto the @xmath8 plane as a more linear excursion .",
    "the rounded loop in both is then associated with the redshifted line emission . a fuller discussion of this morphology is given in pontefract et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . + * objects showing no line effect : *  _ mwc  758 and hd  39529_. in these two cases the data are good enough that we can claim no evidence of any kind of line effect .",
    "+ * objects in need of better observations : *  _ kms  27 and sv  cep_. for these two objects the quality of the data is relatively poor and hence their interpretation is more difficult .",
    "the data on sv  cep suffer from a too low signal , just as was the case for as  477 in the hbe group .",
    "kms  27 suffers from a `` smear '' in @xmath8 space , which is due to the broad photospheric absorption wings . in view of the above ,",
    "the objects kms  27 and sv  cep are dropped from our statistical overview .",
    "the motivation behind this observational study is to discover if there is any dependence of the geometry of the near - stellar environment of herbig ae / be stars upon spectral type .",
    "first we restate the raw statistics of the frequency of detectable linear polarisation changes across h@xmath0  among the herbig be stars , as compared with the herbig aes .",
    "we found that about half of the hbe stars had detectable changes across the line ( 7 out of 12 to be precise ) , while this `` success rate '' rises to a more impressive 9 out of 11 among the hae stars .",
    "note that the present sample sizes are not yet large enough for this difference to be formally significant .",
    "a second attribute that shows some dependence on spectral type is the fractional width of the h@xmath0  line profile over which the polarimetric change occurs , specifically the quantity ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "these fractional widths  as listed in column ( 6 ) of table  [ t_line ]  tend to decrease toward later spectral type . to visualise this",

    "[ f_trend ] .",
    "there is much scatter , in part due to the difficulty of measurement , but presumably also due to real physical scatter .",
    "nevertheless , it is apparent that the fractional widths for e.g. the b0-b2 hbe stars tend to be higher than those observed at spectral types later than a0 : the means for these two sub - groups are respectively ( @xmath14 )  @xmath17 1.0 @xmath18 0.2 and 0.5 @xmath18 0.3 .    of greater significance",
    "is that the herbig ae and be stars present distinct kinds of h@xmath0  signature .",

    "we note that , among the earlier herbig be stars , the phenomenon we have labelled depolarisation is the norm for stars presenting a clear line effect .",
    "we remind this is the behaviour that is also seen in classical be stars .",
    "in contrast to this , there is a marked predominance of more rounded `` loops '' in the @xmath8 plane plots for the hae stars ( seen in only one hbe star , the b9 object hd 58647 ) . in % pol and pa as functions of wavelength , these loops correspond to antisymmetric flips .",
    "it was argued earlier that such behaviour may point to intrinsic h@xmath0  line polarisation that , in turn , most likely demands a compact source of h@xmath0  emission in these objects . the fact that ( @xmath14 )  tends to be noticeably less than one for these objects ( fig .",
    "[ f_trend ] ) is consistent with this idea since the interior polarised line emission could well be narrower than the brighter exterior unpolarised component .    among the hae stars , and where the intensity profile includes a p  cygni blueshifted absorption component , the above - mentioned loops can be accompanied by a second @xmath8-plane excursion on the opposite side of the continuum knot ( i.e. at a relative angle of 90@xmath19 in the plane of the sky ) .",
    "examples of this are ab  aur and mwc 789 . in both cases ,",
    "the `` loop '' is due to the polarisation change across the central / redshifted line emission , while the second orthogonal `` excursion '' is associated with the blueshifted absorption .",
    "similar excursions may be present on their own in t  ori and cq  tau where the polarisation change is associated with significant redshifted absorption .    from the above we find",
    "two limiting patterns of behaviour : ( i ) in the early b group ( b0  b2 ) broad polarisation changes are observed across h@xmath0  that are consistent with depolarisation ; ( ii ) in the later a stars ( a2  f ) , the line effects associated with h@xmath0  emission tend to be narrower than the stokes i profile , and loops are seen in the @xmath8 plane . in between these two extremes we find transitional objects for which we have too few examples to be able to derive a general impression .",
    "it has to be regretted that later b spectral types remain poorly sampled as it would be interesting to see how the transition from early b - type to the a - type h@xmath0  polarisation characteristics is accomplished .",
    "whether the detected difference between the hbe and the hae stars is due to different physics in the hrd or instead due to some observational bias effect is now open for discussion .",
    "altogether we have found that 16 out of 23 herbig ae / be stars show a change in linear polarisation across h@xmath0 .",
    "data on 19 objects have been presented here , and are supplemented by 4 more from od99 . summarised :    * for the herbig be stars : 7 out of 12 reveal a line effect that is consistent with a depolarisation effect caused by a flattened structure in analogy to the presence of discs around classical be stars .",
    "* for the herbig ae stars : 9 out of 11 show a line polarisation effect characterised by a `` loop '' in @xmath8 space , which suggests compact h@xmath0  emission that is itself polarised by a rotating disc - like medium .",
    "we have found that the changes detected in the herbig be stars are like those observed in classical be stars .",
    "it is worth considering whether this 7/12 ( or @xmath2058 percent ) detection rate is also as high as found among classical be stars . before making such a comparison ,",
    "it is necessary to establish the typical sensitivity limit of our spectropolarimetry .",
    "this is most easily derived by assessing the radii of the continuum knots in the @xmath8 plane plots : typically these are large enough that excursions out of them that extend no further than 0.2% are too unclear to claim as definite detections . using this as the detection threshold for polarisation changes across h@xmath0 , we can turn for a comparison to the large classical be sample of poeckert & marlborough ( 1976 ) .",
    "they tabulated the change in line polarisation percentage across h@xmath0  for 48 classical be stars ( their table 2 ) . in 26 of these stars ,",
    "the polarisation change was greater than our sensitivity limit of 0.2% .",
    "this amounts to a 54 percent detection rate to be compared with @xmath2058 percent here .",
    "these percentages are strikingly alike .",
    "the similarity in both spectropolarimetric behaviour and detection rate is a strong hint that herbig be stars are embedded in electron - scattering circumstellar discs of similar characteristics to those associated with classical be stars .",
    "this allows the interpretation of the non - detections to be examples of herbig stars with their discs too face - on to yield measurable line depolarisations .",
    "the predominance of @xmath8 loops in the herbig ae star spectropolarimetry suggests that compact h@xmath0  emission that is itself scattered and polarised by a rotating , non - spherical medium is the norm .",
    "prior examples of this spectropolarimetric behaviour and discussion of its origin may be found in studies of the peculiar be star @xmath21  cas ( poeckert & marlborough 1977 ) and the wolf - rayet binary ez  cma ( schulte - ladbeck et al . 1990 ) . that the frequency of effects among the herbig ae stars is possibly higher than among the herbig be stars",
    "might be expected as the pa rotation can remain visible over a wider range of viewing angles . in the case of ab",
    "aur , pontefract et al ( 2000 ) have suggested that the spectropolarimetric evidence of a rotating , flattened structure surrounding a compact h@xmath0  source might be due to magnetically - channelled accretion .",
    "catala et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also invoked this possibility in the face of a detection of time - variable redshifted absorption in hei lines in ab  aur .",
    "our data include two instances of stars showing significant redshifted absorption at h@xmath0  ( t  ori and cq  tau ) , and many more instances of @xmath8 loops .",
    "( note that infall features at h@xmath0  were previously found by e.g. finkenzeller & mundt 1984 ; de winter et al .",
    "independently , the two lines of evidence would not be such a strong indication of magnetically - channelled accretion ",
    "but together they are rather more compelling . to pursue this issue further",
    ", an interesting next step would be to compare the linear spectropolarimetric characteristics for the herbig stars with those in the lower mass t  tauri stars , a class of young objects for which the magnetically - channelled accretion model is better established ( edwards et al .",
    "1994 ; hartmann 1999 ) .",
    "so far only circular spectropolarimetry has been published ( johns - krull , valenti & koresko 1999 ) for t  tauri stars .",
    "we now consider why there is the observed difference between the herbig be and hae groups , and what it might mean .",
    "one point of view could be that there is a physical transition region in the hertzsprung - russell diagram where the geometry changes , as possibly the mode of presumed accretion changes .",
    "while the herbig ae stars might experience magnetically - channelled accretion resembling that associated with t  tauri stars , the herbig be star accretion flow may not be disrupted at a magnetospheric radius .",
    "the possibility that this might be so inspired the exploration of a radiation - driven disc wind concept for herbig be stars and embedded becklin - neugebauer objects presented by drew , proga & stone ( 1998 ) . before the option of a real transition can be accepted it is important to recognise that the difference may instead simply be one of observational contrast .",
    "crudely speaking , spectral type maps onto effective temperature and , indeed , luminosity  if differences in evolutionary age are taken to be a secondary influence in our sample .",
    "assuming all environmental factors such as the geometry and quantity of circumstellar matter around all herbig ae / be stars to be the same , the mere facts of the higher temperatures and luminosities of the hbe stars imply greater extension of the ionised regions around them , and of course larger dust - free cavities . in accord with this ,",
    "equivalent width is indeed greater among the hbe stars than among the hae stars . in the presence of reduced",
    "line emission and opacity for the hae stars it is easier to detect the interior component that we require should exist inside an axisymmetric rotating structure .",
    "the failure to detect this at h@xmath0  in the early be stars could then be nothing more than a masking of it by the sheer size of the total line - emitting volume and its optical depth .",
    "we have counted mwc  361 ( see fig .  [ f_hbe ] ) as an instance of broad line depolarisation .",
    "this may not be the entire story .",
    "the data for this object show a relatively narrow pa rotation in the red wing of h@xmath0 , on top of what otherwise is a well - defined wide depolarisation .",
    "this may hint at some interior h@xmath0  polarisation reminiscent of that seen among the hae stars .",
    "significantly , perhaps , the h@xmath0  equivalent width measured for mwc  361 ( -63 ) is lower than for most of the other early hbe stars showing simple depolarisations .",
    "a difficulty may however be presented by the case of mwc  166 ( hd  53367 ) .",
    "this early hbe star also has a relatively small h@xmath0  equivalent width ( @xmath162.8   rather and @xmath1614  in od99 ) , but no evidence of a compact h@xmath0  component . in other words , spectropolarimetrically it does not look like an hae star .",
    "the counter to this is to argue that a reclassification of this object is appropriate .",
    "evidence to support this can be derived from the relative weakness of mwc 166 s infrared continuum excess : hillenbrand et al .",
    "( 1992 ) classify it as a class iii source because it is so weak .",
    "these class iii objects are hard to distinguish from more mature classical be stars . perhaps mwc  361 is the seemingly peculiar case that ultimately betrays the geometric parallels between the environments of hae and hbe stars .",
    "however , caution must be exercised in view of the potential impact of the known binarity of mwc  361 ( millan - gabet , schloerb & traub 2001 ) .",
    "there is a test that might distinguish between the two options discussed above .",
    "spectropolarimetry could be performed across less opaque , higher excitation emission lines that can be expected to arise in the same location as the compact h@xmath0  component , if it exists in the hbes .",
    "if the extension and optical depth of h@xmath0  emission indeed masks the evidence of a compact source in the hbes , e.g. he  i or higher balmer line observations could reveal angle rotations ( @xmath22 loops ) in both the hbe and the hae stars .",
    "if however , angle rotations were not observed in the hbe population , while appearing among the hae stars , then the balance of the argument would shift in favour of hbe environments being physically different from those of hae stars on the smallest scales .    as we have found that flattened structures around herbig ae / be stars are common in our data ,",
    "we wonder how this compares with the existing literature on this matter .",
    "we have therefore checked if the spectropolarimetric behaviour of our hae sample correlates at all with the so - called uxor phenomenon ( named after ux  ori ) .",
    "the uxor phenomenon is believed , by some authors , to be associated with dusty clouds orbiting the young star in a close to edge - on disc - like structure ( see e.g. natta et al .",
    "1997 , but see herbst & shevchenko 1999 for a conflicting view ) .",
    "six of the hae stars from our sample appear in the hae compilation by natta et al . , but only three of these undergo photometric changes larger than 1 mag in the v band characteristic for uxors . as some of the stars that do not show uxor behaviour do show loops in @xmath8 space , this indicates that the uxor and spectropolarimetric behaviour have different physical origins : the uxor behaviour may well be linked with large scale dusty clouds , while the spectropolarimetry yields insights on the structure of the accretion flow much closer to the star .",
    "recently , millan - gabet et al .",
    "( 2001 ) conducted an interferometric study at near - infrared wavelengths and they concluded that accretion disc models can be ruled out in most cases .",
    "instead it was claimed that spherical models reproduce the visibility data much better .",
    "note the seeming contradiction with the findings of the spectropolarimetry .",
    "but what are the spatial scales involved ?",
    "the herbig ae stars in sect .",
    "[ s_hae ] of this study show loops in @xmath8 space , associated with pa changes measured to be as narrow as @xmath20 10 @xmath23 .",
    "this wavelength width translates into a velocity in the rotating disc of about 225 . assuming a stellar mass of @xmath20 2 m@xmath1",
    ", we find that this rotation speed corresponds to spatial scales of only @xmath20 7 stellar radii , or equivalently 0.07 au .",
    "this is to be compared to the scales of 0.5  5 au that the interferometry of millan - gabet et al .",
    "can resolve .",
