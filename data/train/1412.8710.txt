    "in recent decades , the emergence of phenomenological braneworld models @xcite@xcite suggested the existence of extra compact and extended dimensions . within the framework of these models it was possible to geometrically reformulate the gauge hierarchy problem @xcite@xcite , to address the cosmological constant problem ( see , @xcite,@xcite , for instance ) and to localize the known matter fields of the standard model in braneworld scenarios with a simple dimensional reduction @xcite@xcite , among other issues .",
    "afterwards , due to the intrinsic singularities that braneworld models possess at the position of the branes , there were proposed several scenarios in which the fifth dimension was modeled by bulk scalar fields , extending the idea of thin branes to thick brane configurations @xcite@xcite .",
    "recently , thick brane models have been proposed in gravity minimally or non - minimally coupled to scalar fields originating from supergravity theories which can be modeled by sigma models , opening thereby the possibility of linking the phenomenology of thick branes to more fundamental theories @xcite .",
    "this research line pretends to understand the standard model physics from a higher dimensional point of view in order to address , reformulate and/or solve several open problems such as the gauge hierarchy problem . as a primary requirement of consistency ,",
    "these models need to localize not only gravity , but also scalar , vector ( gauge ) , and spinor fields on the brane .    in this work",
    "we will focus on studying the localization of spin@xmath3 fermions on the braneworld generated by a tachyonic condensate scalar field along with 5d gravity ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite for braneworld models of this type ) using the conventional mechanism that employs a yukawa coupling between the fermion and the background scalar field , with the interaction term restricted to be an odd function , and will present positive results .",
    "noteworthy recent works reported a new mechanism for localizing fermions with a different yukawa interaction between the background scalar fields and the bulk fermion , where the scalar function can be an even function @xcite@xcite .",
    "the action for the tachyonic scalar field which models the fifth dimension of our work was originally proposed in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the introduction of this tachyonic field in the thin braneworld paradigm was proposed in @xcite , however , the corresponding 5d spacetime possesses physical singularities at the place where the branes are positioned .",
    "a further development of this model was presented in @xcite , where it was shown that it is not possible to localize both gravity and matter fields on the braneworld due to the shape of the used warp factor",
    ". a thick braneworld generalization of this model was presented in @xcite and it was shown that 4d gravity can be localized on it .",
    "moreover , it was proved that the relevant field configuration which gives rise to the braneworld model is _ stable _ under small scalar fluctuations when the gradient of the tachyonic field is small .",
    "the scalar curvature which corresponds to this model is positive definite and asymptotically approaches a 5d minkowski space - time , in contrast with all of the models , to the best of our knowledge , previously reported in the literature .",
    "thus , this model is completely regular and asymptotically flat , instead of ( a)ds@xmath4 .",
    "quite recently it was also reported that in this braneworld it is possible to localize different matter fields as gauge vector fields @xcite and massive ( self  interacting ) scalar fields @xcite . in both of these cases",
    "the spectrum for the massive kk modes presents a mass gap which allows us to study in a better way the physics of the massless bound states , specially within the context of computing the higher dimensional corrections to the coulomb s law that come from the interaction between fermions and gauge bosons localized on the same brane .",
    "thus , the present tachyonic scalar field braneworld turns out to be interesting from the phenomenological viewpoint compared to previous works since it allows us to localize gravity as well as massive scalars , gauge vector fields and fermions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii contains a brief review of the tachyonic scalar field braneworld model @xcite ; section iii presents four cases where we discuss the problem of fermion localization on the brane ; in section iv we compute corrections to coulomb s law coming from the extra dimensional world for two point fermions interacting with a gauge boson localized on the brane .",
    "finally , we conclude in section v with a general discussion of our results .",

    "in this section we shall investigate the localization of spin1/2 fermion bulk matter fields on a tachyon condensate de sitter thick braneworld model by considering a very weak gravitational interaction between gravity and the fermionic fields , so that the brane solution given in the previous section remains valid even in the presence of generalized 5d bulk matter . as a generic feature ,",
    "the 5d profile of the fermion fields obey a schrdinger equation when assuming that the corresponding 4d dirac equations are satisfied .",
    "the mass spectra of the fermion fields on the de sitter thick brane will also be discussed by analyzing the potential of , and by analytically solving the corresponding schrdinger equation for their kk massive modes related to the 4d fermionic fields in four different cases .    in 5d spacetime fermions are",

    "next , we will investigate the kk modes for the 5d dirac equation ( [ diraceq1 ] ) , and write the spinor in terms of 4d effective fields . on account of the fifth gamma matrix @xmath48",

    "iii we found a schrdinger potential of volcano type for left ",

    "chiral massless zero mode is separated from the continuous massive spectrum of kk excitations ; for this scenario the right ",
    "chiral kk massless zero mode is non",
    " localized on the 3brane .    as mentioned above ,",
    "after localizing the fermion fields , our second objective was to make use of the results presented here and in @xcite , which show that it is possible to localize gauge fields in our braneworld model , in order to study the interaction between photons and fermions localized on the brane .",
    "we further performed the computation of the corrections to the coulomb s law coming from the massive gauge vector modes by considering the aforementioned cases ii , iii and iv .",
    "the computed corrections to the coulomb s potential exponentially decay due to the presence of a mass gap in the spectrum of the gauge vector fields .",
    "thus , these corrections decay much faster than @xmath236 due to the exponential function that quickly removes all small contributions from the kk massive gauge vector modes in the limit of thin branes .",
    "moreover , for case iv , it is possible to obtain a novel result that displays the corrections to coulomb s law in a tachyonic de sitter braneworld scenario of arbitrary thickness , allowing us to get an idea of what would be the effects of the electromagnetic interaction between localized fermions , due to non  localized massive gauge bosons . when confronting the estimated correction to the coulomb law with the experimental upper bound on the photon mass we find the our prediction is far away from being detected in the near future .",
