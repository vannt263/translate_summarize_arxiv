    "the former dama / nai @xcite and the present dama / libra @xcite experiments at the gran sasso national laboratory have the main aim to investigate the presence of dark matter particles in the galactic halo by exploiting the model independent dark matter annual modulation signature originally suggested in the mid 80 s in ref . @xcite .",
    "in fact , as a consequence of its annual revolution around the sun , which is moving in the galaxy travelling with respect to the local standard of rest towards the star vega near the constellation of hercules , the earth should be crossed by a larger flux of dark matter particles around @xmath15 2 june ( when the earth orbital velocity is summed to the one of the solar system with respect to the galaxy ) and by a smaller one around @xmath15 2 december ( when the two velocities are subtracted ) .",
    "thus , this signature has a different origin and peculiarities than the seasons on the earth and than effects correlated with seasons ( consider the expected value of the phase as well as the other requirements listed below ) .",
    "this annual modulation signature is very distinctive since the effect induced by dm particles must simultaneously satisfy all the following requirements : the rate must contain a component modulated according to a cosine function ( 1 ) with one year period ( 2 ) and a phase that peaks roughly around @xmath16 2@xmath17 june ( 3 ) ; this modulation must only be found in a well - defined low energy range , where dm particle induced events can be present ( 4 ) ; it must apply only to those events in which just one detector of many actually `` fires '' ( _ single - hit _ events ) , since the dm particle multi - interaction probability is negligible ( 5 ) ; the modulation amplitude in the region of maximal sensitivity must be @xmath187@xmath19 for usually adopted halo distributions ( 6 ) , but it can be larger in case of some possible scenarios such as e.g. those in refs . @xcite .",
    "this offers an efficient dm model independent signature , able to test a large interval of cross sections and of halo densities ; moreover , the use of highly radiopure nai(tl ) scintillators as target - detectors assures sensitivity to wide ranges of dm candidates , of interaction types and of astrophysical scenarios .",
    "it is worth noting that only systematic effects or side reactions able to simultaneously fulfil all the 6 requirements given above ( and no one has ever been suggested ) and to account for the whole observed modulation amplitude might mimic this dm signature .    the dama / libra set - up , whose description , radiopurity and main features are discussed in details in ref .",
    "@xcite has firstly been upgraded in september / october 2008 : i ) one detector has been recovered by replacing a broken pmt ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; ii ) a new optimization of some pmts and hvs has been performed ; iii ) all the transient digitizers recording the shape of the pulse have been replaced with new ones , the u1063a acqiris 8-bit 1gs / s dc270 high - speed cpci digitizers ;",
    "iv ) a new daq with optical read - out has been installed .",
    "also during this upgrade the operations involving the handling of the sensitive part of the setup and the shield have been performed in hp nitrogen atmosphere .",
    "the upgrade has allowed to enlarge the sensitive mass and to improve general features .",
    "here we just remind that the sensitive part of this set - up is made of 25 highly radiopure nai(tl ) crystal scintillators ( 5-rows by 5-columns matrix ) having 9.70 kg mass each one . in each detector two",
    "10 cm long special quartz light guides act also as optical windows on the two end faces of the crystal and are coupled to two low background photomultipliers working in coincidence at single photoelectron level .",
    "the detectors are housed in a sealed low - radioactive copper box installed in the center of a low - radioactive cu / pb / cd - foils / polyethylene / paraffin shield ; moreover , about 1 m concrete ( made from the gran sasso rock material ) almost fully surrounds ( mostly outside the barrack ) this passive shield , acting as a further neutron moderator .",
    "a threefold - levels sealing system excludes the detectors from the environmental air of the underground laboratory @xcite . a hardware / software system to monitor the running conditions is operative and self - controlled computer processes automatically control several parameters and manage alarms .",
    "moreover : i ) the light response ranges from 5.5 to 7.5 photoelectrons / kev , depending on the detector ; ii ) the hardware threshold of each pmt is at single photoelectron ( each detector is equipped with two low background photomultipliers working in coincidence ) ; iii ) energy calibration with x - rays/@xmath20 sources are regularly carried out down to few kev ; iv ) the software energy threshold of the experiment is 2 kev ; v ) both _ single - hit _ events ( where just one of the detectors fires ) and _ multiple - hit _ events ( where more than one detector fires ) are acquired ; v ) the data are collected up to the mev region despite the optimization is performed for the lower one . for the radiopurity ,",
    "the procedures and further details see ref .",

    "in fact , since the probability that a dm particle interacts in more than one detector is negligible , a dm signal can be present just in the _ single - hit _ residual rate .",
    "thus , the comparison of the results of the _ single - hit _ events with those of the _ multiple - hit _",
    "ones corresponds practically to compare between them the cases of dm particles beam - on and beam - off .",
    "this procedure also allows an additional test of the background behaviour in the same energy interval where the positive effect is observed . in particular , in fig .",
    "[ fig_mul ] the residual rates of the _ single - hit _ events measured over the six dama / libra annual cycles are reported , as collected in a single cycle , together with the residual rates of the _ multiple - hit _ events , in the considered energy intervals .",
    "while , as already observed , a clear modulation , satisfying all the peculiarities of the dm annual modulation signature , is present in the _ single - hit _ events , the fitted modulation amplitudes for the _ multiple - hit _ residual rate are well compatible with zero : @xmath41 cpd / kg / kev , @xmath42 cpd / kg / kev , and @xmath43 cpd / kg / kev in the energy regions ( 2  4 ) , ( 2  5 ) and ( 2  6 ) kev , respectively .",

    "similar results were also obtained for the last two annual cycles of the dama / nai experiment @xcite . since the same identical hardware and the same identical software procedures",

    "all this confirms the previous analyses .",
    "the method also allows the extraction of the the @xmath61 values for each detector , for each annual cycle and for each energy bin .",
    "thus , following the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have also verified that the s@xmath64 are statistically well distributed in all the six dama / libra annual cycles and in all the sixteen energy bins ( @xmath65e = 0.25 kev in the 26 kev energy interval ) for each detector .",
    "moreover , that procedure also allows the definition of a @xmath62 for each detector ; the associated degree of freedom are 16 for the detector restored after the upgrade in 2008 and 96 for the others .",
    "the values of the @xmath62/d.o.f .",

    "moreover , the mean value of the 25 @xmath66 is 1.066 , slightly larger than expected .",
    "although this can be still ascribed to statistical fluctuations ( see before ) , let us ascribe it to a possible systematics . in this case",

    "this possible additional error : @xmath69 or @xmath70 , respectively , of the dama / libra modulation amplitude is an upper limit of possible systematic effects .    among further additional tests ,",
    "the analysis of the modulation amplitudes as a function of the energy separately for the nine inner detectors and the remaining external ones has been carried out including the dama / libra-5,6 data to those already analysed in ref .",
    "the obtained values are fully in agreement ; in fact , the hypothesis that the two sets of modulation amplitudes as a function of the energy belong to same distribution has been verified by @xmath62 test , obtaining : @xmath66 = 3.1/4 and 7.1/8 for the energy intervals ( 24 ) and ( 26 ) kev , respectively ( @xmath65e = 0.5 kev ) .",
    "this shows that the effect is also well shared between inner and external detectors .",
    "let us , finally , release the assumption of a phase @xmath71 day in the procedure to evaluate the modulation amplitudes from the data of the 1.17 ton @xmath0 yr . in this case",

    "in fact , these conditions hold for most of the dark halo models ; however , it is worth noting that slight differences can be expected in case of possible contributions from non - thermalized dm components , such as e.g. the sagdeg stream @xcite and the caustics @xcite .",

    "as in the previous analyses , an annual modulation effect is present in the lower energy intervals and the phase agrees with that expected for dm induced signals .",
    "these results confirm those achieved by other kinds of analyses .",
    "sometimes naive statements were put forwards as the fact that in nature several phenomena may show some kind of periodicity .",
    "it is worth noting that the point is whether they might mimic the annual modulation signature in dama / libra ( and former dama / nai ) , i.e. whether they might be not only quantitatively able to account for the observed modulation amplitude but also able to contemporaneously satisfy all the requirements of the dm annual modulation signature .",
    "the same is also for side reactions .",
    "this has already been deeply investigated in ref . @xcite and references therein ; the arguments and the quantitative conclusions , presented there , also apply to the dama / libra-5,6 data .",
    "some additional arguments have also been recently addressed in @xcite .",
    "the obtained model independent evidence  at 8.9 @xmath1 c.l . over 13 annual cycles",
    " is compatible with a wide set of scenarios regarding the nature of the dm candidate and related astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite and in literature , for example see @xcite ) ; and many other possibilities are open .",
    "further future works are foreseen .",
    "it is worth recalling that no other experiment exists , whose result can be directly compared in a model - independent way with those by dama / nai and dama / libra , and that  more in general ",
    "results obtained with different target materials and/or different approaches can not be directly compared among them in a model - independent way .",
    "this is in particular due to the existing experimental and theoretical uncertainties , not last e.g. how many kinds of dark matter particles can exist in the universe , the nature , the interaction types , the different nuclear and/or atomic correlated aspects , the unknown right halo model , the right dm density , etc . as well as the uncertainties on the values of each one of the many involved experimental and theoretical parameter / assumption / approximation used in the calculations .",
    "moreover , some experimental aspects of some techniques used in the field have also to be addressed @xcite .",
    "another relevant argument is the methodological robustness @xcite .",
    "in particular , the general considerations on comparisons reported in appendix a of ref . @xcite still hold .",
    "hence , claims for contradiction have no scientific basis . on the other hand",
    ", whatever possible `` positive '' result has to be interpreted and a large room of compatibility with dama annual modulation evidence is present .",
    "similar considerations can also be done for the indirect detection searches , since it does not exist a biunivocal correspondence between the observables in the direct and indirect experiments . however , if possible excesses in the positron to electron flux ratio and in the @xmath20 rays flux with respect to a modeling of the background contribution , which is expected from the considered sources , might be interpreted  under some assumptions  in terms of dark matter , this would also be not in conflict with the effect observed by dama experiments .",
    "it is worth noting that different possibilities either considering different background modeling or accounting for other kinds of sources can also explain the indirect observations @xcite .",
    "finally , as regards the accelerator searches for new particles beyond the standard model of particle physics , it is worth noting that they can demonstrate the existence of some of the possible dm candidates , but can not credit that a certain particle is the dm solution or the `` single '' dm solution .",
    "moreover , dm candidates and scenarios exist ( even e.g. for the neutralino candidate ) on which accelerators can not give any information .",
    "it is also worth noting that for every candidate ( including the neutralino ) there exist various different possibilities for the theoretical aspects .",
    "nevertheless , the results from accelerators will give outstanding and crucial complementary information in the field .    a new upgrade of dama / libra",
    "is foreseen in 2010 with the replacement of all the low background pmts with new ones having higher quantum efficiency ; the main aim is to lower the software energy threshold and , thus , to increase the experimental sensitivity and to disentangle  in the corollary investigation on the candidate particle(s )  at least some of the many possible astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics scenarios and related experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the new annual cycles dama / libra-5,6 have further confirmed a peculiar annual modulation of the _ single - hit _ events in the ( 26 ) kev energy region satisfying the many requests of the dm annual modulation signature ; the total exposure by former dama / nai and present dama / libra is 1.17 ton @xmath0 yr .",
    "in fact , as required by the dm annual modulation signature : 1 ) the _ single - hit _ events show a clear cosine - like modulation as expected for the dm signal ; 2 ) the measured period is equal to @xmath86 yr well compatible with the 1 yr period as expected for the dm signal ; 3 ) the measured phase @xmath87 days is well compatible with the roughly @xmath16 152.5 days expected for the dm signal ; 4 ) the modulation is present only in the low energy ( 26 ) kev energy interval and not in other higher energy regions , consistently with expectation for the dm signal ; 5 ) the modulation is present only in the _ single - hit _ events , while it is absent in the _ multiple - hit _ ones as expected for the dm signal ; 6 ) the measured modulation amplitude in nai(tl ) of the _ single - hit _ events in the ( 26 ) kev energy interval is : @xmath88",
    "cpd / kg / kev ( 8.9 @xmath1 c.l . ) .",
    "no systematic or side processes able to simultaneously satisfy all the many peculiarities of the signature and to account for the whole measured modulation amplitude is available .",
    "further work is in progress .",
