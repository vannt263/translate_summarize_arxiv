    "in this paper , we study ( euclidean ) vacuum bubble nucleations and their subsequent evolution in the context of the brans - dicke type theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "the brans - dicke theory @xcite is the most studied and hence the best known among all the alternative theories of classical gravity to einstein s general relativity @xcite .",
    "historically , this theory has been thought of as a minimal extension of general relativity that properly accommodates both mach s principle and dirac s large number hypothesis @xcite@xcite .",
    "the action of the brans - dicke theory takes the form @xmath3 = \\frac{1}{16 \\pi } \\int d^{4}x \\sqrt{-g } \\left ( \\phi r - \\frac{\\omega}{\\phi } \\phi_{;\\mu}\\phi_{;\\nu}g^{\\mu\\nu } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the ricci scalar , @xmath5 is a dimensionless coupling parameter , and @xmath6 is the brans - dicke scalar field .",
    "the theory employs the viewpoint that newton s constant @xmath7 is allowed to vary with space and time and can be written in terms of a scalar field @xmath6 as @xmath8 . as a scalar - tensor theory of gravity ,",
    "the brans - dicke theory involves an adjustable but undetermined brans - dicke parameter @xmath5 . as is well known , the larger the value of @xmath5 , the more dominant the tensor ( curvature ) degree , and the smaller the value of @xmath5 , the larger the effect of the brans - dicke scalar .",
    "as long as we select a sufficiently large value of @xmath5 , the prediction of the theory will agree with all observations / experiments @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the brans - dicke theory has remained a viable theory of gravity . moreover ,",
    "interesting models @xcite that explain dark matter and dark energy have been developed , possibly implying that the brans - dicke theory may be a more relevant theory of classical gravity that is consistent with observations .    in this paper , we focus on nucleations of vacuum bubbles .",
    "it is thus convenient to use the euclidean signature .",
    "generally speaking , in non - linear field theories , there are non - topological soliton configurations",
    ". these are solutions of classical field equations in pure scalar field theories with non - linear potential terms .",
    "an interesting and significant example for such a non - topological soliton configuration is the true vacuum bubble .",
    "that is , the bubble arises via quantum tunneling ( i.e. , the super cooled first - order cosmological phase transition ) from the high temperature symmetric false vacuum state to the low temperature symmetry - breaking true vacuum state . along this line ,",
    "the dynamics of quantum tunneling was first developed by @xcite in the flat space - time background and by @xcite@xcite in the curved space - time background .",
    "the formulation that we shall employ in the present work can indeed be regarded as an extension or generalization of this last reference .    in order to study the nucleation and evolution of vacuum bubbles ,",
    "we need a non - linear potential that can give metastable local false vacua and a global true vacuum .",
    "one possible way is to employ the brans - dicke gravity which involves a scalar field with such a potential .",
    "if this is possible , it will be an interesting model since it preserves the weak equivalence principle , which was the initial motivation of the brans - dicke theory . in this paper , however , as a toy model , we shall introduce a potential in the brans - dicke field sector .",
    "indeed , if we relax the original constraints of brans and dicke that protect the weak equivalence principle , the non - linear potential for the brans - dicke scalar field can be used and it would allow vacuum bubble solutions . and",
    "this is why we call this kind of theory a brans - dicke _ type _ theory .    to summarize our results in advance ,",
    "we illustrate three possible ways to obtain vacuum bubbles : true vacuum bubbles for @xmath0 , false vacuum bubbles for @xmath1 , and false vacuum bubbles for @xmath0 when the vacuum energy of the false vacuum in the potential of the einstein frame is _ less _ than that of the true vacuum .",
    "( the third solution of a false vacuum bubble is related to the authors previous papers due to a non - minimally coupled field @xcite . )",
    "after the bubble is nucleated at the @xmath2 surface , we can smoothly interpolate the field combinations to the solutions in the lorentzian signature and consistently continue their subsequent evolutions .",
    "note that , in this paper , we evaluate field configurations and probability amplitudes in the jordan frame in a consistent manner .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : euc ] , we discuss the euclidean action of the brans - dicke type theory . in section  [ sec : nuc ] , we classify and confirm possible nucleation processes of vacuum bubbles in the brans - dicke type theory . in section  [ sec : nucandevo ] , we discuss nucleation and evolution of false vacuum bubbles in the thin wall approximation . finally , in section  [ sec : dis ] , we summarize the present study and discuss related problems .",
    "in this section , we describe the brans - dicke type theory in the euclidean signature .",
    "the action of the brans - dicke type theory @xcite with a potential takes the following form : @xmath9 where the lagrangian density is @xmath10 here , @xmath11 , @xmath6 is the brans - dicke scalar field , @xmath4 is the ricci scalar , @xmath5 is the dimensionless coupling parameter of the brans - dicke type theory , and @xmath12 is the potential of the brans - dicke scalar field .    by extremizing this action with respect to the metric @xmath13 and the brans - dicke field @xmath6 ,",
    "one gets the classical euler - lagrange equations of motion given , respectively , by @xcite @xmath14 @xmath15    in the following subsections , we discuss the possible origin of our choices of the coupling @xmath5 and the potential @xmath12 . in this paper , we work in the geometrical unit @xmath16 .      from observational tests",
    ", it is known that the value of @xmath5 should be greater than @xmath17 @xcite . however , in various physical models , small @xmath5 parameters can be allowed . even though a small @xmath5 is not for our universe , if a small @xmath5 is allowed in the fundamental theory and if such a small value of @xmath5 has implications , the study of various @xmath5 will have theoretical importance .",
    "we now start with the example of dilaton gravity , which has the effective action in the following form @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the space dimensions , @xmath20 is the length scale of string units , @xmath4 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath21 is the dilaton field .",
    "it is interesting to note that a simple field redefinition brings this dilaton gravity into a brans - dicke type theory .",
    "that is , if we define @xmath6 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath24-dimensional gravitation constant , then we end up with a brans - dicke type theory with @xmath25",
    ".    if there are higher loop corrections coming from string theory , there will be other coupling terms in @xmath21 .",
    "for example , the effective action of heterotic string theory compactified on a @xmath26 orbifold takes the following form @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a positive constant of order one which is determined by the coefficients of the anomaly .",
    "the coupling parameter should then be field dependent : @xmath30 . in this specific model ,",
    "@xmath5 depends on @xmath20 and @xmath29 , and it is possible to find @xmath1 . for the case at hand , obviously , the brans - dicke scalar field equation is subject to change and it turns out to be @xcite @xmath31 therefore , if the variation in @xmath6 is sufficiently small , and hence the variation of @xmath32 is sufficiently small , an @xmath5 of less than @xmath33 could be naturally justified .    in the first model of randall and sundrum @xcite ,",
    "two branes have been employed to account for the hierarchy problem .",
    "because of the warp factor between the two branes , we obtain a positive tension brane and a negative tension brane in the anti - de sitter ( ads ) space background . according to garriga and tanaka @xcite , it is interesting to note that , each brane can be described by the brans - dicke type theory in the weak field limit with the @xmath5 parameter @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the location of the negative tension brane along the fifth dimension",
    ", @xmath36 is the length scale of the anti - de sitter space , and the sign @xmath37 denotes the sign of the tension . to explain the hierarchy problem",
    ", we require @xmath38 . we then obtain a sufficiently large value of @xmath5 on the positive tension brane while @xmath39 on the negative tension brane @xcite@xcite . in principle , however , @xmath40 can be chosen arbitrarily , and hence one may infer that various @xmath5 near @xmath33 may be allowed by models of the brane world scenarios .      in the present work",
    ", we consistently calculate all quantities in the jordan frame . in this subsection , we briefly comment on the choice of the jordan frame and its merits .",
    "first of all , the conformal transformation from the jordan frame to the einstein frame is consistent only if @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , in general brans - dicke type models , the jordan frame is more general than the einstein frame , in some sense .",
    "if @xmath0 , then it is possible to transform a solution of a vacuum bubble from the jordan frame to the einstein frame .",
    "however , it is not trivial whether the bubble in the einstein frame is coleman - de luccia type @xcite@xcite or some other type @xcite@xcite ; also it is not trivial whether it is a true vacuum bubble or a false vacuum bubble .    in previous work",
    "@xcite , the authors studied the dynamics of thin wall bubbles for brans - dicke type theories in lorentzian signatures .",
    "one of the interesting results is that a thin wall of a false vacuum bubble may violate the null energy condition in the jordan frame .",
    "however , since we assumed the thin wall approximation , such a property seemed not to depend on the choice of @xmath5 .",
    "if a bubble expands along a causal patch in the jordan frame , it should be the same in the einstein frame .",
    "however , we already know that if @xmath0 , the einstein frame does not violate the null energy condition , and it may imply that such dynamics is not consistent in the einstein frame . then , the natural open question is , what is the proper interpretation of such bubbles in the einstein frame for a given @xmath5 ?",
    "is it consistent even if we do not assume the thin wall approximation ?    to answer this question , the natural direction of study is , first , to classify possible small false vacuum bubbles in the jordan frame , and second , to interpret the meanings of such bubbles in the einstein frame .",
    "accordingly , in this paper , we choose the jordan frame to study a nucleation of vacuum bubbles .      generally , string theory predicts a non - minimal and non - universal coupling of various fields to the dilaton @xcite .",
    "hence , we may well include the potential term for the dilaton field in the original action , if we pay the price of violating the weak equivalence principle .    in practice ,",
    "obviously , we need to choose a specific potential . in this paper ,",
    "the origin of such a potential is not our concern , and thus we will not address this issue .",
    "rather , we will take a simple potential and explore its consequences .",
    "we now start with the effective force function @xmath41 given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a positive constant , @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the field value inside or outside the vacuum bubble ( the subscript @xmath46 denotes a true vacuum and the subscript @xmath47 denotes a false vacuum ) , and @xmath48 is a free parameter that determines the location of the bump of the potential .",
    "we can then choose that the inside and outside regions to be in stable equilibrium .    in the present work , for convenience , we choose @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the true vacuum region .",
    "the potential @xmath12 and the effective potential @xmath51 then take the following form : @xmath52 and @xmath53 with the field equation being given by @xmath54 .",
    "note that the potential in the einstein frame @xmath55 is @xcite @xmath56 of course , we have to represent @xmath55 by a new field @xmath57 , where @xmath58 in order to make the canonical action in the einstein frame .",
    "however , the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath57 is one - to - one and onto .",
    "therefore , the only effect is to stretch the potential along the field direction , and this does not affect the vacuum energy at each field value .",
    "now we evaluate the euclidean action of the brans - dicke type theory to calculate the probability amplitude of bounces .",
    "first , as usual , we assume the @xmath59 symmetric metric @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a function that corresponds to the scale factor in the lorentzian signature , @xmath62 is the euclidean time parameter , and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are angle coordinates on the three - dimensional sphere .    in terms of this @xmath59",
    "symmetric metric , then , the classical euler - lagrange equations of motion are given by @xmath66 and @xmath67 where the over - dot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath62 .",
    "note that the two key equations to evaluate the euclidean action of the brans - dicke type theory are @xmath68 and @xmath69 and the volume factor becomes @xmath70    using these equations , then , we obtain the euclidean action as follows : @xmath71 upon integration by parts , we obtain @xmath72 and the boundary term is irrelevant here as we are interested in the difference between the action of an bounce and the background . finally , after simple calculations",
    ", we end up with @xmath73    this result is indeed consistent with the result of coleman and de luccia @xcite : @xmath74 and we obtain our result again if we change @xmath75 by @xmath76 and @xmath7 by @xmath77 .    finally , if we have a solution of the euclidean metric and field combinations , then we can approximate the probability amplitude @xmath78 of the euclidean bounce by @xmath79 where @xmath80",
    "possible bounce solutions in the brans - dicke type theory .",
    "the lorentzian dynamics is determined by @xmath81 , while the euclidean dynamics is determined by @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath84 are the location of a true vacuum and a false vacuum , respectively , in the lorentzian signature .",
    "diagram ( a ) is for @xmath0 and means a true vacuum bubble in a false vacuum background .",
    "diagram ( b ) is for @xmath1 and means a false vacuum bubble in a true vacuum background .",
    "diagram ( c ) is for @xmath0 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 ; hence a nucleation of a false vacuum bubble is possible . ]    in this section , we illustrate and check out possible bounce solutions of the brans - dicke type theory .",
    "the dynamics of the brans - dicke scalar field is governed by the field equation @xmath87 which is , in turn , determined by @xmath82 .",
    "the second term on the left - hand side is the damping term that eventually causes the scalar field to stop rolling for most cases .",
    "however , clearly it is the potential @xmath12 that determines the nature of the vacuum as being true or false , since the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath12 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bounce ] , we classify possible bounce solutions .",
    "the left diagrams of figure  [ fig : bounce ] are typical effective potentials @xmath51 or potentials @xmath12 .",

    "however , if @xmath85 and @xmath89 , then there may be a false vacuum bubble even in the @xmath0 case . note that the sufficient condition is not only @xmath89 but also @xmath86 ( this will be confirmed in the following subsections ) .",
    "diagram ( c ) is a situation for @xmath0 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 ; hence a nucleation of a false vacuum bubble is possible .    in the following subsections",

    "this smoothly joins the euclidean patch to the lorentzian patch at the @xmath2 surface .    here",
    ", @xmath98 implies that for true vacuum bubbles , we use @xmath99 or @xmath100 with @xmath101 ; @xmath102 and @xmath100 is disallowed .",
    "however , for false vacuum bubbles , only @xmath103 and @xmath100 is allowed . for each allowed case",
    ", @xmath104 implies that each bubble expands over the background .",
    "for the false vacuum case , the result is consistent with our previous paper @xcite : the only expanding bubble in a nearly flat background is for the @xmath103 and @xmath100 case .    for all cases ,",
    "if the solution is allowed , @xmath104 implies that each bubble can expand over the background .",
    "for a false vacuum bubble case , @xmath103 is not allowed and may imply that such a bubble is unstable even though it may be nucleated . for allowed false vacuum solutions , the causal structure of the wall is given by figure  [ fig : thinshell ] .",
    "for a false vacuum bubble , there is a time when a false vacuum bubble is larger than the inner cosmological horizon , while it is smaller than the outer cosmological horizon . in this case , if one transmits a pulse of energy to the bubble and induces an apparent horizon , and if the apparent horizon is larger than the size of the bubble , a de sitter black hole can be seen that separates the inside bubble universe from the outside .",
    "causal structures for @xmath105 cases . for a true vacuum bubble ,",
    "the inside cosmological horizon is larger than the outside cosmological horizon ; for a false vacuum bubble , the inside cosmological horizon is smaller than the outside cosmological horizon . ]",
    "in this paper , we explored the nucleation of vacuum bubbles in the brans - dicke type theory of gravity . in the euclidean signature",
    ", we first evaluated the fields at the vacuum bubbles as solutions of the euler - lagrange equations of motion .",
    "second , we calculated the bubble nucleation probabilities by integrating the euclidean action assuming the thin wall approximation .",
    "we illustrated three possible ways to obtain vacuum bubbles : true vacuum bubbles for @xmath0 , false vacuum bubbles for @xmath1 , and false vacuum bubbles for @xmath0 when the vacuum energy of the false vacuum in the potential of the einstein frame is _ less _ than that of the true vacuum .",
    "after the bubble is nucleated at the @xmath2 surface , we can smoothly interpolate the field combinations to some solutions of the lorentzian signature and consistently continue their subsequent evolutions .    next",
    ", it might be relevant to address the issue of the conformal frame choice between the jordan frame and the einstein frame . in the previous work @xcite , we studied dynamics of expanding small false vacuum bubbles in the brans - dicke theory by using the thin wall approximation .",
    "the effect of the non - minimal coupling of the brans - dicke field makes the effective tension of the wall negative , and therefore the small false vacuum bubble can expand to the surrounding background .",
    "if there is an expanding small false vacuum bubble , it will violate the null energy condition around the wall when it begins to inflate @xcite@xcite .",
    "if we consider this fact , for false vacuum bubbles with @xmath1 , the nucleation of the bubbles is not strange since @xmath1 means that the conformal transformation is not well defined or the defined scalar field in the einstein frame behaves as a ghost since its kinetic term in the lagrangian fails to be positive definite and becomes negative .",
    "however , if a false vacuum bubble for @xmath0 is possible , it seems to be strange . in the jordan frame , this is not a problem since working in the jordan frame can violate the null energy condition @xcite ; however , working in the einstein frame with @xmath0 does not violate the null energy condition and it would be a problem . in the present work , however , our solution does not suffer from this paradoxical situation , since a false vacuum bubble in the jordan frame corresponds to a true vacuum bubble in the einstein frame . in the einstein frame , therefore , there is no reason to conclude that such a bubble violates the null energy condition .",
    "also , it is not so strange , although we obtain a small false vacuum bubble , since the nucleation of a true vacuum bubble in the einstein frame is generally possible .",
    "then , two interesting questions arise .",
    "first , could we define and perform the conformal transformation on the wall ?",
    "second , which conformal frame would be physical ? indeed , this is a long - standing problem which has not been resolved yet .",
    "in addition , for the gravity theory with only tensor degrees of freedom , the choice of relevant conformal frame via conformal transformations is the usual issue to address . for the scalar - tensor gravity theories such as the present brans - dicke type theory or the superstring theories",
    ", however , the conformal transformation needs to be extended to the weyl rescaling .",
    "therefore , when one investigates the physical characteristics of a conformal frame , the weyl rescaling of the scalar field should be carefully taken into account as well for a consistent study . in the present work , however , this issue has not been properly addressed but we expect that even if we consider the weyl rescaling of the scalar degree of freedom , the conclusions presented in the present work would remain essentially the same .",
    "if the einstein frame is physical , our conclusions in section  [ sec : via ] will be irrelevant , and further studies of the nucleation of small false vacuum bubbles should be done .",
    "however , if the jordan frame were physical , the generation of a small false vacuum bubble would be allowed .",
    "it is known that there is controversy regarding the latter question @xcite , and the most conservative interpretation is that the two frames are equivalent , at least at the classical level . if we include quantum effects in a given frame , then the frame would be physical . in this sense",
    ", the choice of the jordan frame is still a viable option .",
    "we leave these two questions open until they can be answered in the future work .",
    "we now conclude that , in general , the scalar - tensor theories or the brans - dicke type theories , which may include and represent certain features of string theory , allow vacuum bubble solutions , not only true vacuum bubbles but also false vacuum bubbles .",
    "one potential problem is that , if we wish to derive a scalar - tensor or brans - dicke type model from string theory , it would be in dilaton gravity ; but in dilaton gravity , the potential of the dilaton field would be restricted by the theory .",
    "if we assume a special condition on the potential , then dilaton gravity could generate a false vacuum bubble ; however , it is still unclear whether dilaton gravity can indeed admit such a special potential .",
    "therefore , we also leave this question open for future work .",
