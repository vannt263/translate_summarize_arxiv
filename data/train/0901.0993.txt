    "gravitational wave astronomy holds the promise to open up an entirely new window into the universe , and a number of ground - based gravitational wave detectors are now collecting data in the quest for first direct detection  @xcite .",
    "binary black hole ( bbh ) mergers are expected to be primary sources of gravitational waves .",
    "theoretical predictions for waves from bbh mergers are now becoming available for various merger scenarios based on numerical simulations as well as post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation methods , with increasing quality and range of validity ( e.g.@xcite ) . among the likely astrophysical scenarios",
    "is that of two black holes merging at the end - point of a non - eccentric , quasi - circular inspiral . although eccentric , non - circular orbits are certainly possible and of interest as well , non - eccentric orbits are expected to be common since the emission of gravitational waves reduces eccentricity on time scales that are short compared to the life time of the binary .    in order to predict waveforms for non - eccentric inspirals , numerical simulations for the einstein equations have to face the issue of how to construct black hole initial data with minimal initial eccentricity .",
    "this is a non - trivial task for several reasons .",
    "the main reason is that the initial data have to satisfy the constraint equations of general relativity .",
    "typical initial data constructions allow us to specify the `` bare '' parameters of a multiple black hole system ( masses , positions , momenta , and spins ) , and the field content ( the metric and extrinsic curvature on a hypersurface ) is generated by solving elliptic equations . the solution process changes or dresses the bare parameters , e.g.",
    "the physical masses and the proper distance between the black holes are obtained as part of the solution .",
    "there are therefore two levels of indirectness in the initial data construction .",
    "discrete parameters are translated into fields , and only after solving the constraints the physical parameters are known .",
    "the goal is to obtain an accurate approximation to the physical situation at some given instant of time , which as a matter of principle can only be an approximation and can not be exact because the evolution prior to this time is not available .    with regard to eccentricity , the question is how initial parameters can be found that result in numerical binary inspirals with minimal eccentricity .",
    "in fact , most numerical simulations have to contend with a small but sometimes non - negligible amount of eccentricity , and it becomes a quantitative question to what extent the computation of faithful gravitational wave templates is hampered by unwanted eccentricity .",
    "for example , the numerical injection and analysis ( ninja ) project @xcite could benefit from and could evaluate the importance of low - eccentricity initial configurations .",
    "several methods are available to find parameters for approximately circular inspirals .",
    "a first approximation is to impose a type of quasi - circularity or quasi - equilibrium condition on the two black holes when solving the constraints , which typically is implemented as an iteration of the orbital parameters and by repeatedly solving the constraints until the quasi - equilibrium condition is satisfied within some given error ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the final judge of the eccentricity contained in initial data is to perform numerical evolutions and to measure the resulting eccentricity .",
    "this leads to the immediate suggestion to iterate initial parameters based on the eccentricity observed in actual evolutions  which , of course , became an option only after numerical simulations of several orbits became possible .",
    "ref.@xcite suggests and applies a parameter iteration method based on evolutions with a pseudospectral code .",
    "the eccentricity is estimated after one or two orbits , and the run is restarted with improved parameters .",
    "the appeal of this method is its generality .",
    "it still has to be determined how well it can work with less accurate finite differencing codes . in particular ,",
    "due to artificial waves and gauge issues it is not clear how many orbits are required to measure the eccentricity with sufficient accuracy in the numerical simulation . for short simulations of only a few orbits , several iterations of the method",
    "may be computationally expensive .",
    "another natural idea in this context is to obtain orbital parameters from pn methods .",
    "once pn orbital parameters for minimal eccentricity within the pn approximation are found , they can be used as input for a constraint solution scheme within the full theory .",
    "even simple implementations of this method can work surprisingly well .",
    "for example in @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , it turns out that already a simple 3pn formula to compute the tangential momentum @xmath6 for a pn circular orbit with vanishing radial momentum @xmath7 , leads to approximately circular inspiral initial data when combined with the puncture method  @xcite to construct binary black hole initial data .",
    "typical numerical simulations start shortly before the merger , say at an initial separation that allows 5 to 15 orbits before merger . in this regime ,",
    "the pn approach becomes increasingly inaccurate with decreasing separation as the dynamic , strong field effects of the inspiral become severe . in order to improve on the pn parameters of @xcite , we can look to more sophisticated pn approximations , say involving the effective - one - body ( eob ) approach  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the pn method should also supply a non - vanishing radial momentum @xmath7 .",
    "ironically , it is the use of `` quasi - circular '' initial parameters with vanishing radial momentum that leads to non - circular , eccentric inspirals , since by definition a spiral requires a non - vanishing radial momentum .",
    "we note in passing that there also exists a method to translate pn data including not only parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , but also the pn field content to numerical initial data  @xcite .",
    "the result is black hole puncture data with more realistic gravitational wave content  @xcite , a feature shared with the periodic standing wave approximation , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this feature is not essential for numerical evolutions , but in any case is not implemented by the methods discussed here .",
    "one way to obtain improved pn parameters for inspirals with small eccentricity is to start with a simple initial guess and to perform evolutions of a few hundred orbits in the pn hamiltonian formulation until the orbit has circularized to a high degree due to the emission of gravitational waves @xcite . in terms of computational effort ,",
    "note that once the pn formulas for the hamiltonian system have been coded , the time integration is easily handled by a standard mathematica function in less than a minute .",
    "the elegance of the pn evolution method is that for any reasonable initial guess the pn evolution leads to a circularized inspiralling orbit due to the physical process of wave emission , and this is achieved with little additional effort .    for numerical simulations of equal mass binaries without spin ,",
    "the residual eccentricity is reduced by up to a factor of five by the pn evolution method  @xcite compared to simple 2pn quasi - circular parameters @xcite , with an eccentricity @xmath8 at an initial separation of @xmath9 .",
    "for comparison , several equal mass data sets are mentioned in @xcite , with @xmath10 the lowest value used for finite differencing codes , @xmath11 a typical value prior to the recent improvements , but @xmath12 for the iteration method in a pseudospectral code  @xcite .",
    "for more general binaries with spin and unequal masses , there is some improvement of a typical initial guess using the pn evolution method , but the numerical eccentricity is not always as small as one may wish  @xcite .",
    "as suggested in  @xcite , it may be possible to add one iteration step to improve the situation for binaries with spin .",
    "the pn evolution method also demonstrates how large the eccentricity can be within the pn method itself if certain simple prescriptions for quasi - circular orbit parameters are used . on the other hand ,",
    "the question arises how well a more sophisticated pn method can achieve orbital parameters for non - eccentric inspirals .",
    "in particular , we want to ask the question whether there is a pn method that produces orbital parameters directly ( without resorting to pn evolutions ) that leads to reduced eccentricity for numerical simulations .",
    "as explained above , we do not look for a method that reduces the eccentricity to zero , but any pn parameter proposal can be called successful e.g.  if it reduces the eccentricity below the level of changes introduced by the constraint solving process . in any case , pn parameters can provide a good initial guess for an iteration based on full numerical simulations .",
    "one of the problems associated with the application of pn methods is that there is not one , but a multitude of approaches that differ in strategy as well as in small but important details .",
    "for example , two sets of pn initial parameters may be equivalent up to a certain pn order , but show differences in numerical simulations , which may be sensitive to the higher order terms that have been neglected .",
    "in this paper we focus on the proposal of buonanno , chen , and damour  @xcite to compute quasi - spherical pn initial data .",
    "this work was based on the hamiltonian formulation plus the known energy - loss rate and considered an adiabatic sequence of spherical orbits .",
    "that means the tangential momentum is determined by demanding a constant binary separation when using the conservative part only . in a second step the radial component is derived by asking for the rate at which these spherical orbits are ( adiabatically ) traversed by including the energy flux .",
    "the approach is capable of incorporating spin - orbit interactions to leading order , which may present a simple way of improving initial data for spinning binaries .",
    "the present paper implements the suggestions and the algorithm of @xcite and modifies it to be more directly applicable to dynamical variables instead of kinematical ones , i.e.  admtt momenta instead of velocities .",
    "following @xcite we implement two variants of pn hamiltonians , the usual taylor - expanded and the eob version .",
    "we also consider two versions of the energy flux , the classical taylor - expanded flux for circularly orbiting bodies and a particular pad approximant of it . when combined with the two choices of hamiltonians this results in four different versions to study .",
    "in section [ sec : pneom ] we provide a detailed survey of the required equations .",
    "we further examine the transition from eob coordinates to admtt - type coordinates , which becomes necessary when extracting initial data from the eob hamiltonian .",
    "the initial data algorithm itself is described in section [ sec : idalgorithm ] .",
    "section [ sec : numresults ] is dedicated to the exploration of these data in numerical simulations with the bam code . by measuring the orbital eccentricity obtained in numerical simulations we can argue which of the four data types is most appropriate .",
    "the investigation includes mass ratios 1:1 , 2:1 , and 4:1 for vanishing spin , several cases of spin aligned to the orbital angular momentum for mass ratio 1:1 , one anti - aligned case and one situation with arbitrarily chosen spins . especially for binaries with spin",
    "the resulting eccentries are found to be quite large , but initial data involving the eob hamiltonian still give reasonably small eccentricity .",
    "this section provides the required equations of motion of a black - hole binary system consisting of objects of masses @xmath13 , positions @xmath14 , momenta @xmath15 and spins @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . for our purposes",
    "it is sufficient to restrict considerations to the center - of - mass dynamics , where @xmath18 .",
    "following @xcite we use a hamiltonian description in either admtt gauge or in eob coordinates .",
    "the hamiltonian formalism turns out to be very useful when working with the canonically conjugate position and momentum variables and in distinguishing conservative and radiative effects .",
    "the system s equations of motion take the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 labels the non - conservative force and @xmath21 denotes the usual vector cross product .",
    "the conservative part consists of an orbital and a spin contribution and we will use the total hamiltonian formed by the sum of three components , @xmath22 & + h_\\text{ss}({\\boldsymbol{x}},{\\boldsymbol{p}},{\\boldsymbol{s}}_1,{\\boldsymbol{s}}_2).\\label{eq : sumhamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the individual terms are presented in the subsequent paragraphs .",
    "we consider two versions of the orbital contribution @xmath23 , the standard 3pn accurate taylor - expanded hamiltonian ( th ) derived by damour , jaranowski , and schfer  @xcite , and the effective - one - body hamiltonian ( eh ) given by buonanno , damour , jaranowski , and schfer at 3pn order in  @xcite ( given first at 2pn in  @xcite ) .",
    "it is crucial to note that the two hamiltonians are defined for different coordinate systems .",

    "this reflects the high sensitivity of the eccentricity to small changes in the momenta .",
    "the minimal eccentricity obtainable by the method is about @xmath174 for mass ratios from 1:1 to 4:1 .",
    "for smaller initial binary separation the pn initial data become less appropriate since the underlying equations approach their limit of validity . moreover ,",
    "the deviation in the gauges , that is admtt gauge on the pn side versus maximal slicing in the numerical simulation , grows .",
    "the numerical example for @xmath172 shows that the eccentricity grows to @xmath175 for equal masses , which is twice as large as for @xmath9 .",
    "considering how close @xmath172 is to the merger , it is surprising how well the pn initial parameters work in this context .    going to higher mass ratios the putative advantage of eh data first seems to show at 4:1 , although the difference in initial momentum to th data is quite small .",
    "given the available data , the smaller eccentricity might be accidental , but we believe there is a systematic trend based on corresponding results for spinning binaries .",
    "( numerical simulations at 10:1 have recently become available  @xcite , so the behavior for increasing mass ratios could now be investigated further . )    utilizing the same hamiltonian , our th data are expected to give results similar to the pn - evolved data , and this is indeed the case .",

    "spacetime is twisted in the vicinity of each spinning hole and the other object is forced to follow this twist . when both spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum each black hole tries to accelerate the other on its orbit , with the effect that less orbital momentum @xmath6 is needed for a circular inspiral .",

    "the th and eh surfaces for @xmath7 are almost identical for a certain part of the parameter space , in particular as long as both spins are positive . for strong negative spins , especially for the dominant spin of the bigger black hole at mass ratio 4:1 ,",
    "large changes in @xmath7 occur . obviously , the taylor - expanded data are affected most , resulting in a behavior similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : pradcompareadmtoeobmassratios]d , such that no reasonable solution is obtained beyond a certain spin threshold .",
    "considering their poor performance in numerical runs , we conclude that th data are as inappropriate in this regime as in the non - spinning case at high mass ratios .",

    "based on the work of @xcite we presented several variations of an ( almost ) analytical algorithm capable of delivering quasi - spherical initial data for black - hole binary systems . by employing two different pn hamiltonians in combination with two versions of energy - flux functions we constructed four types of initial parameters . for the resulting initial data we performed numerical simulations within the moving puncture framework with the bam code , both for non - spinning and spinning binaries , where we focussed on the class of aligned spins .",
    "an eccentricity measurement provided information on the quality of the data . in summary",
    ", the eccentricity of the initial data considered grows for smaller binary separations , larger mass ratios and larger spin magnitudes .    in the non - spinning case ,",
    "differences in the initial parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 as well as in the resulting eccentricities were found to be comparatively small and often beyond the accuracy of our measurement . however , th data happen to suffer from a parasitic pole at higher mass ratios . in particular due to the eh data we were able to meet or even to obtain slightly lower eccentricities than those resulting from the pn - evolution method of @xcite . as in @xcite , a non - zero radial component of the initial momentum",
    "is required for best results .",
    "as soon as spins are incorporated , pn theory shows that non - eccentric inspirals are not possible in general due to spin - spin interactions , but we demonstrated that eh initial data are suitable to minimize the radial oscillations to a certain degree , at least for special , aligned spin constellations .",
    "we considered one example for non - aligned spins , for which a similarly small eccentricity was obtained .",
    "further runs with arbitrary spin directions are planned for future research . as expected , the eccentricities in simulations with spins turned out to be larger than the spinless ones .",
    "the th data gave comparatively poor results , which again can be considered an effect of the pole mentioned above .",
    "to end with a concrete suggestion for practical implementations , a good starting point is the eob hamiltonian with the taylor expanded flux , especially for non - zero spin , but also for mass ratios 4:1 and larger . for smaller mass ratios the taylor hamiltonian gives smaller eccentricities , but the eccentricity for both eh and th is quite small .",
    "the main complication in the eob method is the need for the transformation to admtt coordinates for the numerical initial data .",
    "table [ tab : initialdata ] gives explicit values for initial parameters for several non - spinning binary configurations that can be used directly in simulations .",
    "use the combination of @xmath6 and @xmath7 for which the eccentricity given in the last column of the table is lowest .",
    "initial data for several binary configurations with ( anti-)aligned spins can be read off table [ tab : initialdataconstraints ] .",
    "for all cases with @xmath200 , the ehpf data leads to the lowest eccentricity .",
    "further investigations suggest themselves .",
    "the pn - evolution method of  @xcite depends on the quality and characteristics of the hamiltonian evolution method .",

    "'' initial data has been suggested in  @xcite , which is worth investigating in the context of numerical evolutions as well .",
    "apart from evolutions , it could be interesting to compare to other diagnostics for the eccentricity of orbits , e.g.@xcite .",
    "an alternative to the th and eh methods considered here is the semi - analytic puncture evolution approach to model inspiralling black holes  @xcite .",
