    "there has been considerable study of the bond percolation cluster considered as a random - resistor network , with each occupied bond having unit resistance and non - occupied bonds having infinite resistance @xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "the configuration studied is typically an @xmath3 lattice and the conductance is measured between two opposite sides which are assumed to have infinite conductance .",
    "the backbone of the cluster is then defined as the set of bonds that are connected to the two sides having infinite conductance through paths that have no common bond .    at the percolation threshold , the backbone mass scales as @xmath4 with @xmath5 @xcite and in this `` bus bar '' geometry",
    "is strongly correlated with @xmath6 .",
    "the total conductance of the backbone as a function of @xmath6 has been studied extensively and has been found to scale as @xmath7 with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "recently , the distribution of masses of backbones defined by two _ points _ ,",
    "i.e. , backbones defined as the set of those bonds that are connected by paths having no common bonds to two points separated by distance @xmath1 within an @xmath3 lattice , has been studied @xcite .",
    "one finds that when @xmath9 , there is a very broad distribution of backbone masses for a given @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates some typical percolation clusters and their backbones defined in this configuration . because of the broad distribution of backbone masses we have the opportunity to study the conductance between these two points separated by a fixed distance , @xmath1 , as a function of the mass of the backbone defined by these points .",
    "one might expect that , for fixed @xmath1 , the average conductance would increase with increasing backbone mass because there could be more paths through which current can flow .",
    "in fact , we find that the average conductance decreases monotonically with increasing backbone size , in contrast with the behavior of homogeneous systems and non - random fractals in which conductance increases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "we explain our finding by noting that the conductance is strongly correlated with the shortest path between the two points , and then studying the distribution of shortest paths between the two points for a given @xmath2 .",
    "this analysis extends recent studies of the distribution of shortest paths where no restriction on @xmath2 is placed @xcite .",
    "our system is a two - dimensional square lattice of side @xmath10 with points @xmath11 and @xmath12 defined as @xmath13 , @xmath14 . for each realization of bond percolation on this lattice , if there is a path of connected bonds between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , we calculate ( i ) the length of the shortest path between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , ( ii ) the size of the backbone defined by @xmath11 and @xmath12 and ( iii ) the total conductance between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we obtain data from 100,000 realizations for each of 8 values of @xmath1 ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , and 128 ) at the percolation threshold , @xmath15 . we bin these results based on the value of the backbone mass , @xmath2 by combining results for all realizations with @xmath16 and taking the center of each bin as the value of @xmath2 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , we plot the simulation results for the average conductance @xmath0 and find that the conductance , in fact , decreases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "the decrease is seen more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , in which we plot scaled values as discussed below .",
    "in non - fractal systems , the conductance increases as the mass of the conductor increases .",
    "we next consider the average conductance on the sierpinski gasket , a non - random fractal , the first three generations of which are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a)(c ) . because the sierpinksi gasket is not translationally invariant , the analogue of the average conductivity between two points in the percolation cluster is the conductivity averaged over all pairs of points separated by distance @xmath1 . at each successive generation , there are two types of pairs : ( i ) pairs which correspond to pairs in the previous generation ( e.g. , a and b ) and ( ii ) pairs which do not correspond to pairs in the previous generation ( e.g. , d and e ) .",
    "it is obvious that as we move from one generation to the next , the conductance between pairs of type ( i ) increases because there are more paths between the points then in the previous generation . on the other hand ,",
    "the conductance between the pairs of type ( ii ) are lower on average than between the pairs present in the previous generation because on average the shortest path between the two points is longer than between the pairs in the previous generation . however , for any given @xmath1 , the shortest path between any two points has a fixed upper bound independent of the generation . due to this bound on the shortest path ,",
    "the net result is that the average conductivity increases with succeeding generations .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) in which we plot the average conductivity calculated exactly for generations 1 to 6 for @xmath17 , 2 and 4 .",
    "in order to understand why the average conductance of the percolation backbone decreases with increasing @xmath2 , we must ( i ) recognize that the conductance is strongly correlated with the shortest path between the two points and ( ii ) study @xmath18 , the distribution of shortest paths between the two points for a given backbone mass .",
    "hence we next create the @xmath18 probability distribution , binning the data logarithmically by taking the average over samples centered at @xmath19 .",
    "figure [ fig4](a ) shows the results of the simulations for @xmath18 for @xmath17 for various backbone masses .",
    "the plots collapse , the only difference in the plots being the values of the upper cut - offs due to the finite size of the backbone .",

    "[ fig4](b ) , we show the distributions @xmath18 for different @xmath1 and a given @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) we see that when scaled with @xmath20 the plots collapse , so we can write @xmath18 in the scaling form @xmath21 an expression for @xmath22 can be found by recognizing that we can write the well - studied distribution @xmath23 , the probability that the shortest path between two points separated by euclidean distance @xmath1 is @xmath24 , independent of @xmath2 , as @xmath25 where ( i ) @xmath26 is the distribution of backbone masses given distance @xmath1 between the points which determine the backbone and ( ii ) @xmath27 is the lower cutoff on @xmath2 given @xmath24 .",

    "we can now calculate the average conductance .",
