    "it is difficult to crystallise globular proteins yet it is important to do so as x - ray crystallography can be performed on crystalline proteins and the full structure of the protein in its native state determined @xcite . knowing the structure of a protein is crucial to understanding its function .",
    "proteins are of course vital to all life .",
    "crystallising a protein is difficult as there seem to be only a few conditions under which a protein solution crystallises but many under which the solution is either stable on all accessible time scales or useless amorphous aggregates form .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the simpler system of hard - sphere - like colloids .",
    "the crystallisation of these is routine . here",
    "we will examine the first stage of crystallisation : nucleation .",
    "we will do so using classical nucleation theory .",
    "although not a quantitative theory , it has the merit of simplicity and incorporates the essential features of nucleation .",
    "these are that nucleation is a large amplitude , localised , fluctuation which forms a microscopic crystallite of the crystalline phase .",
    "because of their phase diagram @xcite it has been suggested @xcite that the interaction between globular protein molecules can be approximated by a steeply repulsive core , which prevents two protein molecules interpenetrating , and an attraction with a range that is much less than the diameter of the protein ; the surfaces of two protein molecules have to be within a tenth or less of their diameter for there to be a significant attraction . here",
    "we will study a simple model potential of this type .",
    "in fact , the interactions between protein molecules are complex and include quite specific , non - spherically symmetric interactions @xcite , thus it should be borne in mind that our model potential is extremely simplified .",
    "classical nucleation theory requires as input the chemical potential of the metastable fluid phase from which the crystal forms , the chemical potential of the crystalline phase and the surface tension .",
    "the last of these three , the surface tension , often poses a problem as the surface tension is known for only a very few model potentials .",
    "indeed even for the simplest potential , the hard - sphere potential , accurate values for the surface tension have only been calculated recently @xcite . however , recently the author has calculated the surface tension for a potential consisting of a hard core and a very short - ranged attraction @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we will define our model potential and describe its phase behaviour",
    ". we will give the required expressions for the chemical potential in the fluid and solid phases .",
    "then in the third section we will obtain the classical nucleation theory predictions for our model .",
    "the fourth section compares our theory with experiment and the fifth is a conclusion .",
    "first , we define the hard - sphere+square - well potential @xcite .",
    "it is the spherically symmetric pair potential @xmath0 defined by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the hard - sphere diameter , and @xmath3 is the separation between the centres of the spheres .",
    "the potential depends on one parameter , @xmath4 , the ratio of the range of the attraction to the hard - sphere diameter .",
    "we will always consider this range to be small : @xmath5 . the first person to consider very short - ranged attractions was baxter @xcite who considered a potential with zero range , @xmath6 , and with a well - depth @xmath7 adjusted so that the second virial coefficient @xcite was of order unity .",
    "@xmath8 is the temperature and @xmath9 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "this model is often termed the sticky - sphere model . within it",
    "the second virial coefficient is used as a temperature - like variable .",
    "however , stell @xcite showed that the sticky - sphere model was pathological , its fluid phase is unstable at all non - zero densities .",
    "therefore , we will not consider this model but instead will follow stell when we take the limit @xmath10 , thus obtaining his @xmath11 model @xcite .",
    "the bulk phase behaviour of the @xmath11 model is described in refs . and , and is displayed in fig .",
    "[ sspd ] . if the double limit @xmath12 and @xmath13 is taken such that @xmath14 then the equilibrium phase behaviour is identical to that of hard spheres . if @xmath15 then the behaviour is radically different : a close - packed solid coexists with a fluid phase of zero density .",
    "the temperature @xmath16 is @xcite @xmath17 the close packed density is @xmath18 which corresponds to a volume fraction @xmath19 occupied by the hard cores of @xmath20 . at close packing",
    "there is an isostructural solid - solid transition @xcite .",
    "the bulk phase behaviour of hard spheres with a short - range square - well attraction , @xmath21 , is qualitatively similar @xcite .",
    "it is essentially fig .",
    "[ sspd ] but with the corners rounded off and the horizontal ( vertical ) lines no longer horizontal ( vertical ) but sloping , see refs . and .",
    "the coexisting densities no longer change discontinuously but only rapidly near @xmath16 .",

    "the solid phase is very low ( zero in the @xmath12 limit ) .",
    "so , we will approximate the chemical potential of the fluid phase by that of an ideal gas . around the temperature @xmath16 the density of the fluid phase which coexists with the solid rapidly increases ( in the @xmath12 limit it is horizontal ,",

    ", the helmholtz free energy per particle , @xmath29 , of the solid phase can be calculated by using a cell theory @xcite , and assuming that the attractions are strong enough so that they force the lattice constant to be small enough so that each sphere is within the range of the attractive interaction of all twelve of its nearest neighbours @xcite .",
    "this fixes the energy per particle at @xmath30 and the lattice constant at @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a constant a little less than one , see ref . .",
    "then the helmholtz free energy per particle @xmath29 is @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the partition function of a single particle trapped in a cage formed by its twelve neighbours fixed at their points in a perfect lattice .",
    "this lattice is either face - centred cubic or hexagonal close - packed , in each a particle has the same arrangement of nearest neighbours so it does not matter which . as the lattice constant is sufficiently small , throughout the cage",
    "the particle attracts all twelve neighbours and so its energy is constant at @xmath30 .",
    "the partition function is then just the volume available to the centre of mass of the particle times @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the integral over the momentum degrees of freedom .",
    "the volume is of the order of @xmath37 , i.e. , the cube of the difference between the lattice constant and the hard - sphere diameter .",
    "the particle at its lattice position is @xmath31 away from each of its neighbours and can not move within @xmath2 of them due to the hard - sphere interaction .",
    "thus , it can move a distance @xmath38 in the direction of each of its neighbours .",
    "actually , the volume to which the particle is restricted is quite complicated , see ref . , but it is not far from @xmath37",
    ". we will approximate it by @xmath39 ; an approximation which becomes increasingly accurate as @xmath4 decreases @xcite .",

    "the pressure is very low , note that the gas density is zero in fig .",
    "[ sspd ] . therefore , @xmath44 contributes a negligible amount to the chemical potential for the @xmath11 model .",

    "@xmath62 is the value of @xmath58 at @xmath16 , when the fluid  solid transition widens from the relatively narrow coexistence region of hard spheres to coexistence between a dilute gas and a near close - packed solid .",
    "the experiments measure the strength of the attractive interaction by measuring the second virial coefficient via scattering whereas we measure it via the ratio of the well - depth to the thermal energy , @xmath7 .",
    "thus we consider here the problem of relating @xmath64 and @xmath58 to @xmath7 . for nonzero @xmath4 , @xmath64 and",
    "hence @xmath58 is a well - behaved single - valued function of temperature and so it is possible to uniquely map each value of @xmath64 or @xmath58 to a temperature @xmath8 and vice - versa .",

    "nucleation occurs from a metastable phase , i.e. , a phase which is not the equilibrium phase .",
    "we can not obtain the nucleation rate in a metastable phase without making assumptions about this phase .",
    "we will assume that the metastable phase is close to an ideal gas .",
    "justification for this assumption is provided by the fact that the densities we will consider will be quite low @xmath74 and the second virial coefficient , eq .",

    "the second virial coefficient is the coefficient of the leading order correction to the ideal gas pressure in a density expansion for the pressure @xcite .",

( [ mus ] ) gives the chemical potential of the solid phase at coexistence @xmath45 which is equal to @xmath79 .",
    "the surface term is the surface area of the nucleus times the surface tension @xmath81 of the bulk interface between the coexisting solid and fluid phases , i.e. , any difference between the spherical interface between the solid nucleus and the surrounding metastable fluid phase , and the flat interface between the coexisting solid and fluid phases is ignored .",
    "the interfacial tension of an interface between a solid phase and a fluid phase depends on the orientation of the interface with respect to the lattice of the solid . to get around this problem , either some orientationally averaged interfacial tension or the interfacial tension with the interface in the plane of a low index lattice plane",

    "the surface area of the nucleus is obtained by assuming that the nucleus is a perfect sphere of radius @xmath3 which is related to @xmath77 by assuming that the density of spheres within the nucleus is equal to the bulk density of the solid phase . for the @xmath11 model",

    "then the surface area of the nucleus is @xmath83 .",
    "so , @xmath84 the first term in @xmath76 is the bulk term , which is negative and decreases linearly with @xmath77 , and the second term is the surface term which is positive and increases as @xmath85 .",

    "this is the nucleus of the solid phase at the size at which its free energy is greatest . as the frequency",
    "with which a fluctuation occurs scales as @xmath88 , the formation of the fluctuation with the highest free energy cost is the rate limiting process .",

    "we will approximate @xmath81 for all small values of @xmath4 by the surface tension of the 111 plane @xmath93 , which will vary with @xmath4 .",

    "however , as the coexistence densities were not determined accurately we can not compare our theoretical predictions with these experiments .",

    "the short - range attraction makes nucleation more difficult : the surface tension , eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , is larger than for many other systems , e.g. , hard spheres , which means that at the same value of @xmath101 the free energy barrier to nucleation is higher when there is a short - ranged attraction than for hard spheres .",
    "the surface tension for hard spheres is , from density - functional theory , @xmath125 @xcite , whilst with an attraction of range 10% of the diameter of the particle , @xmath119 , at a temperature @xmath126 , it is @xmath127 .",
    "the surface tension for hard spheres is an order of magnitude smaller and the nucleation rate is very sensitive to the surface tension , it varies as @xmath128 $ ] at constant @xmath101 .",
    "the large barriers to nucleation predicted by classical nucleation theory are certainly consistent with the difficulty experienced in crystallising proteins @xcite and the non - equilibrium behaviour observed for colloidal particles with a short - ranged attraction @xcite .",
    "however , the uncertainty surrounding the interaction between protein molecules makes comparison with theory , which is for a specific model potential , very difficult .",
    "experimental results for the location of the onset of nucleation @xcite for colloidal systems for which the the interaction potential potential and phase coexistence boundaries are both known would be very useful in understanding protein crystallisation and in testing theoretical predictions .",
    "the barrier to nucleation decreases as the temperature drops more and more below the transition temperature @xmath46 , i.e. , as @xmath108 decreases , and we move further into the metastable region of the phase diagram .",
    "thus we can lower the free energy barrier by moving deeper into the metastable regime .",
    "however , by doing so we may encounter difficulties such as the fluid becoming sufficiently cold to form a gel - like state @xcite in which the dynamics are at least partly arrested , preventing the formation of the crystalline phase .",
    "ten wolde and frenkel @xcite have suggested that a metastable fluid  fluid transition may offer a way round this problem .",
    "an interesting prediction of classical nucleation theory is that the critical nucleus at a given value of the free - energy barrier shrinks as the range of the attraction , @xmath4 , decreases .",
    "thus under the conditions in which the free - energy barrier is small enough to permit nucleation on a reasonable time scale the nucleus becomes smaller and smaller as @xmath4 decreases .",
