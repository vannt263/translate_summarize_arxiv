    "recently much attention has been paid to the investigation of macroscopic tunneling phenomena between coupled bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "the theory has been developed for weakly as well as for strongly overlapped condensates @xcite-@xcite . as a result , it was shown that , in oscillations of the relative atomic population , periodic processes of two types can exist .",
    "one which is characterized by a zero mean atomic inbalance function @xmath1 , corresponding to the periodic flux of atoms between two condensates due to the overlaps of the wavefunctions .",
    "the second type has a net atomic population balance @xmath2 , corresponding to the so - called macroscopic self - trapping , with localization of atoms in one of the condensates , and a periodically varying population around a constant value .",
    "the different regimes are connected with the value of the initial phase differences @xmath3 between the condensates and the effective nonlinearity @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are the nonlinearity parameters depending on the atomic scattering length @xmath6 ( which in turn depends on the two - atoms interactions ) , and @xmath7 is the total number of atoms .    if a periodic variation of the parameters of the trap and of the bec is introduced , new phenomena show up .",
    "examples of this are the resonant phenomena with a periodically varying trap potential considered recently for the case of weakly coupled bec in @xcite and for the strongly overlaped bec in @xcite .",
    "the optical analog of this process is the electromagnetic wave transmission in a nonlinear coupler with periodic variation of tunnel coupling @xcite .",
    "further interesting cases occur when a time - dependent atomic scattering length in bec is considered .",
    "this is made possible due to the fact that @xmath6 depends resonantly on the external magnetic field or on the laser field @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this means that the scattering length can be varied in time , in particular , periodically .",
    "the main interest now is to investigate the influence of this periodic variation of atomic scattering length on the macroscopic interference phenomena .",
    "the central point here consists in that , as the interference phenomena are time - periodic processes in a nonlinear system , we can expect a nonlinear resonant response of the system under time - periodic perturbations , leading to a variety of phenomena , such as hysteresis or chaos .",
    "the problem of weakly coupled bec s in a double - well trap potential with time - dependent atomic scattering length @xmath6 can be described by the two - modes model @xmath8 where the parameters @xmath9 are defined by the overlaps integrals of the time dependent gross - pitaevsky eigenfunctions and derived in @xcite . in particular , @xmath10 are the parameters characterizing the nonlinear interactions between atoms and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the time dependent atomic scattering length .",
    "this system of equations is valid in the approximation of a weak link between condensates .",
    "as comparison with the numerical solution of gpe shows that it is a good aproximation for @xmath13 ( see the definition of @xmath14 below ) . anther limitation is connected with the time dependence of @xmath6 . for a harmonic modulation in time",
    "we should require that the perturbation does not introduce transitions between the ground state and excited states in the trap , whose energy gap is of the order of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the harmonic frequency of trap .",
    "then we have the restriction @xmath17 .",
    "another characteristic frequency is given by the coupling between condensates and is defined as @xmath18 . for the weak coupling case",
    "when @xmath19 the regimes of resonant @xmath20 and rapid modulations of @xmath6 can be realized .",
    "the periodic modulation of nonlinearity in the gross - pitaevsky equation can also lead to the parametric instability of the collective excitations of the condensate @xcite , that , in turn , leads to the break down of the two - modes approximation . because these frequencies are far from the ones considered below we wiil use the model ( [ 1 ] ) in our analysis .    introducing new variables @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are the number of atoms and phases in the i - th trap",
    ", we get the system @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath18 , @xmath26 being the frequency of the linear rabi oscillations , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for the positive and negative atomic scattering length , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian of the unperturbed system ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) is @xmath32 below , if not specified otherwise , we will consider the case of positive scattering length @xmath33,and @xmath34 .",
    "consider the initial phase difference to be zero , @xmath35  the zero - phase mode .",
    "depending on the number of atoms , @xmath7 , and two - atoms interaction , @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 , there may exist a macroscopic quantum tunneling regime with @xmath38,corresponding to @xmath39 and a self - trapped regime with @xmath40 , corresponding to @xmath41 .",
    "the same is valid for the initial phase difference , @xmath42  the @xmath0-phase mode .",
    "let us consider now the case of periodic modulations of the atomic scattering length , when @xmath43 , inducing a variation of @xmath37 , i.e , @xmath44 .",
    "such a variation can be achieved by the variation of the external magnetic field @xcite - a magnetic field induced feshbach resonances for example . near the resonance",
    "the scattering length is varied dispersively and can have positive and negative values",
    ". we will consider situations when we are not close to resonance and variations of scattering length are small , that is , @xmath45 .",
    "let us first consider the case where @xmath35 .",
    "take the case of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath48 , assumed to be small , we obtain the equation for the relative atomic population @xmath49 where , @xmath50 . for @xmath51 we can reduce the equation to @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the frequency of linear oscillations , and @xmath54 .",
    "it is useful to introduce a new variable @xmath55 and a scaled time @xmath56 .",
    "then we have the equation @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "let us consider the dynamics in the parametric resonance region when @xmath59 . using the results of perturbation theory @xcite",
    ", we find that the parametric resonance occurs when the condition for the square of increment @xmath60 is satisfied , where @xmath61.\\ ] ] we have included here a nonlinear correction to the frequency @xmath62 .",
    "then we obtain the limit for the amplitude for parametric resonance to occur , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    in fig.(1 )",
    "we present the oscillations of @xmath14 when the parameters are in the region of the parametric resonance , by integrating numerically eq.([tun ] ) .",
    "we now come to the case @xmath65 , with for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the system ( [ tun ] ) is simplified and reduces to one equation for @xmath68 , having the form of the equation of a double pendulum .",
    "inspection of this equation shows that there exists a valley in the effective energy @xmath69 around @xmath70 .",
    "the maximum of the valley depth is achieved when @xmath71 .",
    "thus we can search the solution of the system in this region of parameters assuming @xmath72 .",
    "it results that we obtain the following equation for @xmath14 @xmath73 here @xmath74 .the parametric resonance in the oscillations of the atomic population appears when @xmath75 .",
    "the parametric instability occurs when @xmath76 .",
    "the increment @xmath77 is , in this case , @xmath78    for example , when @xmath79 we have @xmath80 . in fig.(2 ) we plot the oscillations of @xmath81 for this choice of parameters , and with @xmath82 , by a nummerical integration of eq.([tun ] ) .",
    "note that the frequency of linear rabi oscillations is @xmath18 , or one in the units used .",
    "thus the resonance in @xmath0 -mode occurs at frequencies _",
    "lower _ than the rabi frequency .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the metastable @xmath0-phase mode has been recently observed in the weak link separating two reservoirs of superfluid he@xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the oscillations induced by the periodic perturbations of the scattering length may be comples and become chaotic , for certain regions of the parameters .",
    "note that the unperturbed system is equivalent to the duffing oscillator .",
    "thus , as is known , the resonance overlaps under periodic perturbations can lead to chaotic variations of @xmath14 @xcite . in such cases , to study the chaotic motion , it is useful to look for the motion near the separatrix of the unperturbed system .",
    "the total hamiltonian is @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is unperturbed hamiltonian ( 4 ) and the perturbation is @xmath86 .",
    "the value of the hamiltonian on separatrix is @xmath87 .",
    "the separatrix divides the regions with macroscopic quantum tunnelling , with @xmath88 , from the self - trapped regions where @xmath89 .",
    "the expressions for the separatrix solution are : @xmath90 where @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "for example , for the zero - phase mode the separatrix is given by the hyperbolic fixed points @xmath93 .",
    "the existence of chaos can be proved by calculating the melnikov function .",
    "the calculations are similar to the ones performed in @xcite and shows that the melnikov function has an the infinite number of zeros , so the existence of chaotic regimes in the atomic population oscillations is proved . in fig.(3 ) we plot the melnikov distance versus the frequency @xmath94 for @xmath95 . we see that the maximum value is achieved for @xmath96 .",
    "in fig.4 we plot the difference of atomic population @xmath14 as function of time for @xmath97 .",
    "it is interesting to obtain an analytical estimate for the critical amplitude of modulation @xmath98 leading to the chaotic behavior in the relative atomic population . using the expression for the separatrix ( [ sep ] ) we can calculate the melnikov - arnold integral and find that the energy change for a perturbation @xmath99(where @xmath100 is the phase ) is @xmath101)dt \\",
    "= \\alpha \\sin(\\psi ) , \\ \\alpha = \\frac{\\pi \\varepsilon |1 - \\lambda|\\omega^2}{\\lambda \\sinh(\\pi\\omega/2\\sqrt{\\lambda-1})},\\ ] ] where @xmath102 $ ] denotes the poisson bracket .",
    "the period of the unperturbed motion is @xmath103 , where @xcite : @xmath104 \\quad , \\ ] ] @xmath105 \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . near the separatrix , when @xmath107 we have @xmath108 . introducing the parameter @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and taking into account that @xmath112 , when @xmath113 , we obtain the estimate for the period of oscillations near the separatrix @xmath114    using the expressions ( [ ma ] ) and ( [ per ] ) we find the whisker - type map for our problem @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "this map can be simplified , using the linearization around the fixed points @xcite .",
    "the fixed points are defined by @xmath118    let us introduce the dimensionless energy @xmath119 , defined by @xmath120    substituting this expression into eq.([map ] ) , and redefining @xmath121 , we obtain the standard map @xmath122 where the parameter @xmath123 is @xmath124 as is well known , chaos appears when @xmath125 ( exact value is @xmath126 ) .",
    "then we have the estimate for the critical amplitude of modulation @xmath127    from the above , we may calculate the diffusion coefficient for the motion in the stochastic layer @xmath128 it results that we have @xmath129 . for frequencies",
    "@xmath130 we have the estimate @xmath131 for @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , the time of exit from the stochastic layer is @xmath136",
    "i.e. @xmath137 periods of the oscillations of the atomic scattering length .",
    "in the case when the frequency of oscillations of the atomic scattering length is much larger than the tunneling frequency @xmath18 . i.e. @xmath138 , where @xmath139 , it is useful to derive an averaged set of equations . using a multiscale approach @xcite and expanding @xmath140",
    "we can derive the system of equations for the slowly varying functions @xmath141 .",
    "the limits of validity is @xmath142 .",
    "the averaged system turns out to be : @xmath143 where @xmath144 is proporttional to @xmath145 , and for the harmonic modulation is @xmath146 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath147    with respect to the unperturbed case , a new stable point can occur .",
    "a bifurcation is observed when @xmath144 is increased . the unstable point ( in the undisturbed case ) at @xmath148 may become stable under rapid perturbations .",
    "this phenomenon is the analog of the kapitza stabilization of the unstable fixed point of the pendulum by rapidly oscillating the suspension point . by passing though the bifurcation , a change in the topology of the phase portrait happens .",
    "the value of @xmath144 for this to occur depends on @xmath149 . to have an estimate of the critical value of @xmath144 ,",
    "consider @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "the equation for @xmath152 reads : @xmath153 thus , when @xmath154 we have oscillatory motion around @xmath155 in the phase plane . when @xmath156 we have an hyperbolic point , and @xmath155 is no longer stable .",
    "for example , with @xmath157 , the critical @xmath144 is @xmath158 . for @xmath159 ,",
    "the point is always stable , as @xmath160 . to support these results , we have numerically integrated the original systems given by eq.([tun ] ) with an explicit harmonic fast - time variation for @xmath161 . the above described features immediatly",
    "show up .",
    "note also that we can cross the sign of @xmath6 from positive to negative .",
    "experiments with very a large monotonic change of sign show that the bec shrinks very fast",
    ". it would be interesting to check if the condensate with attractive interaction of atoms stable under the rapid variation of scattering length .",
    "this problem requires , however , separate investigations . in any case in quasi @xmath162 geometries collapse is suppressed and this analysis is relevant .    in order to better understand the physical consequences of the averaging",
    ", we note that for small @xmath142 we can rewrite the hamiltonian in the form @xmath163 where @xmath164 , @xmath165 .",
    "thus we can conclude that the result of the averaging consists , for a fixed initial phase difference between condensates , in the lowering of the critical relative population for self - trapping regime to occured and in the increase of the critical value of the nonlinear parameter @xmath37 .",
    "we come to the picture of a more rigid pendulum in comparison with the constant case .",
    "the threshold for the switching from the macroscopic quantum tunneling regime to the self - trapping regime is shifted to lower initial values of the atomic imbalance .",
    "in this paper we have studied the new effects occuring due to time - periodic variations of the atomic scattering length .",
    "the resonances in oscillations of the atomic imbalance for the different regimes have been analyzed .",
    "the interaction of resonances occuring under oscillating scattering length can lead to complicated behavior of the atomic oscillations and gives rise to the phenomenon of _ chaotic macroscopic quantum tunneling_. in this work we prove the existence of such regime , using the melnikov function approach and calculating the melnikov distance , characterizing the width of the stochastic layer near the separatrix of the unperturbed system .",
    "we derive a whisker type map for the problem and obtain the estimate for the critical value of amplitude @xmath98 leading to the chaotic motion .",
    "the diffusion coefficient for the motion in the stochastic layer is calculated and shown that the time to cross the stochastic layer is the order of few periods of modulations .",
    "we also consider the evolution of the system under rapidly varying oscillations of the scattering length and derive the averaged system for the slow - time variations of the relative atomic population @xmath166 and the phase @xmath167 .",
    "the analysis of the fixed points shows that the stabilization of the system under rapid perturbation , when the unpertubed is unstable , is possible in the @xmath0 -phase mode .",
