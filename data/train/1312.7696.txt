    "the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation describes the dynamics of the interface between a 2d unstable phase and a stable phase @xcite .",
    "the interface is represented as the graph of a single - valued function @xmath108 , i.e. : a _ height _ field , in the small - slopes approximation .",
    "its dynamics follows a non - linear stochastic partial differential equation ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) of the main text ) : @xmath109 where @xmath7 , @xmath9 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are parameters quantifying ( average and excess- ) growth , surface tension , and noise intensity , with @xmath6 being a random field with unit variance , white in space and time .",
    "the study of the kpz equation has allowed to elucidate the _",
    "kpz universality class _ , which encompasses many different models , both discrete and continuous .",
    "the kpz equation relies on approximations including the assumption of small slopes and the absence of overhangs .",
    "moreover , by construction it can not describe explicitly systems , like circular interfaces , which can not be specified by the graph of a single - valued function",
    ". there have been attempts to study an intrinsic - geometry version of the kpz equation , free from such assumptions , which have found difficulties due to the strong non - linearity of the equation ; on the other hand , phase - field studies are too expensive computationally to provide a thorough analysis of the scaling properties , see a brief overview in @xcite .",
    "a solution to all these shortcomings was proposed in @xcite , in which a _ covariant form _ of the kpz equation is put forward ( eq .",
    "( 2 ) of the main text ) : @xmath112 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 refer to growth speed and surface tension , while @xmath17 provides the noise amplitude . here",
    ", @xmath13 stands for the local extrinsic curvature and @xmath14 is the local normal direction , pointing towards the non - aggregated phase .",
    "the long time behavior of equation ( [ ckpz ] ) in band geometry with periodic boundary conditions was studied in @xcite , where ample numerical evidence was given that it falls into the kpz universality class , with @xmath113 and @xmath81 .",
    "the main advantage of equation ( [ ckpz ] ) is that it can be studied in circular geometry directly as it stands .",
    "its covariance properties are even stronger , since any change in the background metric can be straightforwardly absorbed by the equation .    in order to obtain a well - defined dynamical system for an interface , equation ( [ ckpz ] ) must be complemented with a prescription for the treatment of intersections . as in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "whenever a self - intersection appears in the interface , we have chosen to _ remove the smaller component _ , whether it is a cavity or an outgrowth .",
    "mathematically , intersection removal is thus the price one needs to pay in order to have a simply connected interface .",
    "physically , by comparison with more realistic ( e.g.  stochastic moving boundary ) kpz - related growth models , of which equation ( [ ckpz ] ) and similar models are effective descriptions , its role for the morphological evolution seems to be quite marginal even for parameter conditions in which voids and bubbles occur , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "indeed , with respect to the kinetic roughening behavior , the main role in the morphological evolution is played by the envelope of the so - called active growth zone @xcite , that corresponds in our case to the simply connected interface that we keep track of after self - intersection removal .",
    "our choice is akin to the standard procedure by which the full interface dynamics of , e.g. , discrete growth models that lead to bubbles and overhangs due to bulk vacancies @xcite is traded for that of such an envelope .",
    "most approaches to continuous models of circular growth describe the interface via a ( single - valued ) polar function @xmath114 , thus preventing the creation of _ radial _ overhangs .",
    "our approach does not suffer from this constraint either @xcite .",
    "our numerical method of simulation will be the same as in @xcite .",
    "the interface is represented by a chain of points ( a `` _ polymer _ '' ) , @xmath115 , defining a piecewise continuous curve which always leaves the solid region on its left .",
    "the distance between them is forced to remain in a certain interval @xmath116 $ ] , which is achieved by inserting or removing points dynamically .",
    "all the geometric elements are obtained in a natural way .",
    "thus , we define the tangent line at @xmath117 as the segment joining @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and the normal vector is the unit vector orthogonal to it pointing outwards . the extrinsic curvature at @xmath117 is defined as the inverse of the radius of the circumference which passes through @xmath118 , @xmath117 and @xmath119 , which is a discrete approximation to the osculating circle .",
    "this extrinsic curvature is signed : it is defined to be positive when @xmath117 is at the left side of the tangent line . in other terms , when the interface is locally convex .",
    "numerical integration of the stochastic partial differential equation was performed with an euler - maruyama algorithm . in all cases",
    ", the initial condition will be a circular interface with small radius @xmath25 , centered at the origin @xmath26 .",
    "our numerical scheme does not suffer from instabilities from the non - linear character of the equation .",
    "an important aspect of the algorithm is the detection of self - intersections , for which we have employed the technique described in @xcite .",
    "our self - intersection removal algorithm works in three stages : ( 1 ) mark the pairs of segments which are candidates for intersection by evaluating whether the cartesian boxes which contain them overlap , ( 2 ) for the candidate pairs , find out whether they do possess an intersection point , ( 3 ) if the intersection point exists , mark it as a new point of the interface , detect the smaller component ( in length ) and remove it .    for the results described in the main text , we have run 2500 samples of equation ( [ ckpz ] ) , starting with a circle with @xmath30 .",
    "the values of the parameters are @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with @xmath120 , @xmath21 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "results have been checked to ensure the continuum limit has been suitably approximated .",
    "a small number of samples ( 50 ) were allowed to continue up to @xmath123 .",
    "* fit to a circumference _ with center at the origin_. the average radius will be given by @xmath125 , where @xmath126 denotes average over all realizations of the interface for a given time .",
    "the roughness @xmath127 is given by the average deviation from the fitting circumference : @xmath128 , i.e. : the error of this fit . * fit to a circumference with _ adjustable center _ , which we may interpret as the center of mass ( cm ) . the average radius",
    ", @xmath129 will always be smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "the roughness is again given by @xmath130 , and it is smaller than in the fixed - center case in all cases . * the best shape to fit the interface _ need not _ be a circle .",
    "we may also try a fit to an _",
    "ellipse_. in this case , the output of the fitting procedure is the center of mass , the two principal radii , @xmath131 and @xmath132 ( the average radius corresponding to @xmath133 ) and the angle which the largest radius makes with a fixed direction @xmath134 .      *",

    "* anisotropy of the interface : we measure the _ quadrupole moment _ : @xmath138 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are always relative to the cm . for a completely isotropic model , like ours , this is a measure of the eccentricity of the fitting ellipse .",
    "additionally , by defining the _ gyration tensor _",
    "@xcite @xmath139 again with @xmath140 and @xmath141 defined with respect to the cm , another measurement that we have performed is the ratio of its smallest to largest eigenvalues , @xmath54 , namely , the so - called asymmetry parameter @xcite @xmath142      a different problem is posed by the _ morphology curves _ , which show the roughness at each scale , @xmath143 . in @xcite",
    "a technique was developed to obtain the roughness at a given length , by using movable windows of width @xmath73 .",
    "all points within a window are fitted to a straight line , and their deviations from that line constitute the local roughness . in order to transfer this scheme to the circular geometry setup",
    ", we have to take into account that the natural fit is not to a straight line , but to an arc of circumference .",
    "this problem can be circumvented using the following `` rectification '' procedure :    * for every point @xmath144 , the polar coordinates are found from the cm : @xmath145 .",
    "* we apply a _ rectification mapping _ : @xmath146 . in other terms : each point is projected on the fitting circle .",
    "the new @xmath59 coordinate is the arc - length in this circle .",
    "the new @xmath60 coordinate is its distance to the fitting circle .",
    "we next write down an approximate model for the time evolution of the average interface radius @xmath35 .",
    "we first integrate eq .   over the full length of the evolving curve at a fixed time @xmath148 where @xmath37 is the total curve length , @xmath149 its total curvature , and",
    "@xmath150 is the integral of the noise contribution .",
    "next we average over realizations of the zero - average noise @xmath6 , to obtain @xmath151 where we have made additional assumptions :    * we simplify @xmath152 .",
    "hence , we are neglecting local changes in the normal velocity along the curve . * in principle , the factor multiplying @xmath15 in the first term on the right hand side woule be @xmath153 .",
    "we approximate it by the circle length in order to have a differential equation which is closed in @xmath35 .",
    "thus we finally get @xmath154 which is equation ( 3 ) of the main text , provided @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "note , an equation of the latter form is the simplest one would expect starting from .",
    "thus , e.g.  @xmath157 for the deterministic case of a circle .",
    "note this surface - tension term contributes to the global interface velocity , in contrast with the case of band geometry .",
    "eq .   can be exactly solved as an implicit function for @xmath35 , which reads @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "this is the exact solution employed in the fit shown in the main text .",
    "as discussed there , the excellent fit suggests equation as an accurate description for @xmath35 , provided one allows for parameter renormalization whereby @xmath161 and @xmath162 in general .",
    "actually , such a change in parameter values is induced by the noise .",
    "thus , in fig .  [ fig:1_sm ] we see that , for sufficiently small but non - zero noise amplitudes @xmath163 , the evolution of the radius @xmath35 can not be distinguished from the one obtained in the determinstic limit of eq .  ."

    "<S> thus , as proposed in @xcite , the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the height fluctuations for interfaces which , like many of these , belong to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class @xcite , depends on the global curvature . </S>",
    "<S> the eponymous equation @xcite , which is the prime representative for these systems , is a continuum model for the evolution of a rough interface between a ( stable , e.g.  solid ) phase that grows at the expense of a(n unstable , e.g.  vapor ) phase , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the height field above substrate position @xmath4 at time @xmath5 , @xmath6 is gaussian white noise , @xmath7 is the growth speed for a flat interface , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 are additional parameters . on the one hand , from the point of view of the theory of stochastic processes , the kpz equation features a remarkable example of a time crossover @xcite between the two main universality classes of kinetic roughening @xcite , namely , the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) class at short times , and the kpz class at long times . </S>",

    "<S> the theoretical values for the tw - gue distribution are @xcite @xmath99 for the skewness and @xmath100 for the kurtosis , which are close enough . for comparison @xcite , for the tw - goe distribution </S>",
    "<S> the skewness is @xmath101 and the kurtosis @xmath102 , both being zero for the gaussian distribution . </S>",

    "<S> we must remark the _ negative _ sign that we obtain for parameter @xmath91 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , implying a negative skewness for @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> physically , this is due to the fact ( data not shown ) that , in regime ii , the number of cavities removed per unit length and unit time by the self - intersection removal condition is smaller than the number of removed outgrowths .    in summary , while for relatively small noise , perhaps as the experimentally studied case @xcite , only kpz scaling is obtained , for large noise intensities eq .   </S>",
    "<S> predicts a circular interface to cross over in time between an early - time saw regime , in which it behaves as a freely fluctuating ring `` polymer '' , and the late - time regime controlled by kpz fluctuations in the presence of non - zero average curvature . for small times , the local driving does not suffice to counteract fluctuations , so that the average circular shape smears out , interactions among interface points being controlled by surface tension ( note the dynamic exponent indeed is @xmath103 in regime i ) . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath75 increases while @xmath35 stays almost constant , eventually the system becomes fully correlated . from that time on , the increasing length needs to be accommodated in the finite area enclosed by the initial radius , and the intersections removal mechanism becomes relevant , smoothing out the interface . because of the average ( convex ) circular geometry , cavities are removed more frequently than outgrowths , and the interface starts to grow leading to the expected kpz regime , with tw - gue characteristics .    </S>",
    "<S> our results conspicuously connect the celebrated 2d saw and kpz universality classes , both of which underscore the importance of geometrical constraints for scaling behavior , in and out - of - equilibrium . crucially , the transition in time between them can only be elucidated through the existence of overhangs , which eludes other _ continuum _ models of kinetic roughening . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the large noise regime i of eq .   might constitute a scaling limit for 2d ring saw @xcite , while providing an efficient algorithmic procedure to generate them @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternative connections between the kpz and saw classes are available , namely , between iso - height lines of the 2 + 1 dimensional ( 3d ) kpz equation and 2d saw - related formulations @xcite . in general , the conformation and dynamics of circular polymers is still a subject of considerable interest @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> current experimental capabilities reach even down to single molecule experiments @xcite , so that one might speculate on the possibility to observe a dynamical transition of the type elucidated here in appropriate non - equilibrium , 2d constrained settings @xcite .    </S>",
