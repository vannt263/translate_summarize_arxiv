    "this paper studies the numerical approximation of incoming solutions to maxwell s equations in terms of the electric field , @xmath0 , and the magnetic field , @xmath1 , @xmath2 in the exterior of a spherical obstacle , with dissipative boundary condition on the sphere ( see  ) . here , @xmath3 is the permittivity of the medium , @xmath4 is the permeability , and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the known current density of the system .",
    "we approximate numerical solutions , whose total energy decays exponentially with time .",
    "such solutions are called _ asymptotically disappearing _ ( ads ) and this phenomenon is of interest for inverse back - scattering problems , since the leading term of the back - scattering matrix becomes negligible .",
    "details and construction of such solutions for the exterior of the unit sphere are found in the recent work by colombini , petkov , and rauch  @xcite .",
    "the dissipative boundary conditions of interest are @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the outward unit normal to the boundary and @xmath9 is a parameter satisfying @xmath10 .    for a spherical obstacle , a case",
    "on which we focus on here , the boundary is @xmath11 . in  @xcite",
    ", it is shown that for any value of the parameter @xmath12 determining the dissipative boundary condition , there exist initial conditions such that the boundary value problem for maxwell s equations has a solution , which decays exponentially in time as @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that in space such solutions also decay asymptotically at infinity , i.e. they behave as @xmath15 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , for dissipative boundary conditions , ( [ eq : boundary - condition ] ) , if @xmath12 , there are no disappearing solutions , @xmath16 , that vanish for all @xmath17 in the exterior of the sphere ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the focus of this work is on the finite - element approximation of the ads in the exterior of a polyhedron that approximates the sphere .",
    "this is a first step towards developing numerical techniques , which later can be used to construct approximations to ads for more complicated obstacles and also for other symmetric hyperbolic systems with dissipative boundary conditions .",
    "such a general study is feasible due to a recent result of colombini , petkov , and rauch @xcite for hyperbolic systems whose solutions are described by a contraction semigroup @xmath18 .",
    "more precisely , it was shown in @xcite that if certain coercivity estimates are satisfied , then , the spectrum of the generator , @xmath19 , in the left half plane , @xmath20 , is formed only by discrete eigenvalues with finite multiplicities .",
    "every such eigenvalue , @xmath21 , yields an ads solution , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ existence _ and the _ location _ of such eigenvalues for less regular obstacles is a difficult and interesting mathematical problem ( both from theoretical and numerical point of view ) , albeit it falls beyond the scope of the work reported here .    for the finite - element spaces that we use , their properties and implementation in the numerical models based on maxwell s system",
    "are more or less known .",
    "classical references on the piecewise polynomial spaces relevant in such approximations are the papers by raviart and thomas  @xcite ( for two spatial dimensions ) , ndlec @xcite , and bossavit  @xcite .",
    "the method that is used here is an application of the techniques developed by brezzi  @xcite , ( see also brezzi and fortin  @xcite ) .",
    "many results and references on maxwell s system and its numerical approximation are found in hiptmair s work  @xcite and in a monograph by monk  @xcite . in most of these works ,",
    "the emphasis is on systems with perfect conductor boundary conditions .",
    "this important difference between our work and the previous ones is that , here , we apply the methods to a problem with dissipative boundary conditions , where the electric field , @xmath24 , and the magnetic field , @xmath25 , are paired together . a related discussion on the role of the boundary conditions in the numerical solution of systems of pdes are discussed in a recent paper by  arnold , falk and gopalakrishnan  @xcite .",
    "we consider the finite - element problem associated with maxwell s equations in a finite domain between two spheres , @xmath26 , for a fixed , large enough @xmath27 .",
    "the discretization of the maxwell s equations that keeps the coupling between the electric and the magnetic field in tact and can be derived via the modern techniques in finite element exterior calculus is described in arnold , falk and winther  @xcite .",
    "we approximate the region by first constructing a tetrahedral mesh for the domain @xmath28 ^ 3 $ ] and then mapping it to @xmath29 in polar coordinates , @xmath30 .",
    "we denote the resulting partition in tetrahedra by @xmath31 .",
    "in such a way , we obtain a computational domain ( denoted again with @xmath29 ) , which is _ polyhedron _ and which _ approximates _ the exterior of the annular domain @xmath32 .",
    "note that the ads constructed in  @xcite for the exterior of the sphere do not need to satisfy the dissipative boundary condition on the polyhedron .",
    "however , we show numerically that the finite - element solution with initial conditions approximating those in @xcite yields good approximation of the ads constructed analytically , when the mesh size becomes small and the polyhedron gets closer to the sphere .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : background ] , we introduce some notation and state the strong form of the boundary value problem for maxwell s equations that we consider .",
    "section [ sec : weakform ] describes the variational ( weak ) formulation and discusses the energy decay of the corresponding system .",
    "next , we discuss the discretization of this variational form and how we can guarantee a good approximation of the ads in section [ sec : discrete ] . in section [ sec : time ] , we describe the matrix representation of the semi - discrete system and the properties of the crank  nicholson scheme that we use for time stepping .",
    "numerical results for the sphere are shown in section [ sec : numerics ] . finally , concluding remarks and discussions on constructing initial conditions as well as a choice of parameters for more complicated obstacles are presented in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "first , some standard notation is introduced , which is needed in the following sections .",
    "the euclidean scalar product between two vectors in @xmath33 is denoted by @xmath34 and the corresponding norm is @xmath35 . the standard @xmath36 scalar product and norm",
    "are denoted by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the system of partial differential equations ( pdes ) of interest is maxwell s system with a dissipative boundary condition ( impedance boundary condition ) .",
    "let @xmath39 be a bounded , connected ( could be convex ) domain , @xmath40 . as stated in the introduction , we consider maxwell s equations in the exterior of @xmath41 , that is , in @xmath42 , which is as follows : @xmath43    for the rest of the paper",
    ", we assume that the permitivity , @xmath3 , and the permeability , @xmath4 , are equal to @xmath44 .",
    "future work will involve investigating numerical methods when these parameters are allowed to vary with the domain .",
    "we also assume that @xmath29 is bounded , which means @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a ball in @xmath47 with sufficiently large radius . while in general this could be a restriction , in this case it is not , since the solutions that are approximated decay exponentially when @xmath48 .",
    "the boundary conditions that are of interest are also known as impedance boundary conditions . to state such type of boundary conditions , we first define @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents the boundary of the inner obstacle , and @xmath51 the outer boundary ( i.e. , the boundary of @xmath46 ) .",
    "the orthogonal projection , @xmath52 , on the component of a vector field tangential to @xmath53 is also needed , which for any @xmath54 and a vector field @xmath55 is defined as the tangential component of @xmath56 , namely : @xmath57 where @xmath8 is the normal vector to the surface @xmath50 .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the normal pointing away from the domain ( i.e. pointing into @xmath39 ) .",
    "we note that all the quantities above depend on @xmath58 .",
    "the boundary condition of interest is the one in   and it is recalled here : @xmath59 as pointed out above , @xmath12 is a constant , i.e. @xmath60 .",
    "however , the same methods can be applied for @xmath61 as a function on the boundary of the domain .",
    "[ rem : perfect ] note that for a perfectly conducting obstacle , the tangential component of @xmath24 vanishes on the boundary , namely : @xmath62 however , again , this paper considers the case of an impedance condition , where the obstacle is not a perfect conductor .",
    "this is closer to real - world applications , where dissipative boundary conditions occur frequently .",
    "to approximate the differential problem   with the boundary conditions given in  , the function spaces for the problem at hand need to be identified . given a lipschitz domain @xmath29 and",
    "a differential operator @xmath63 , a standard notation for the following spaces is used : @xmath64 with the associated graph norm , @xmath65 by taking @xmath66 or @xmath67 , the sobolev spaces @xmath68 and @xmath69 are obtained . also , notice that @xmath70 for example",
    ", @xmath71 is the space of @xmath36 vector - valued functions , whose @xmath72 is also in @xmath36 . similarly for @xmath73 and @xmath68 .",
    "the following three spaces are needed ( the first one for scalar functions and the second and third for vector - valued functions ) : @xmath74 note that the tangential component of the electric field @xmath24 and the normal component of the magnetic field @xmath25 on the outer boundary , @xmath75 , are set to zero for the elements of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    another issue to address",
    "is related to the fact that the boundary of the computational domain consists of two connected components @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "in such a case , the electric field @xmath24 is unique up to a harmonic form ( harmonic function , constant on @xmath50 ) . to resolve the ambiguity , we consider electric fields in a subspace of @xmath76 , which is orthogonal to the one - dimensional space of harmonic forms .",
    "let @xmath78 be the unique solution to the laplace equation : @xmath79 then , define @xmath80 as the space of functions orthogonal to @xmath81 : @xmath82 finally , for the time - dependent problem considered here , the relevant function spaces are @xmath83 in another words , if @xmath84 denotes any of the hilbert spaces @xmath85 , @xmath80 , or @xmath77 , then @xmath86 is the space of functions , which for each @xmath87 takes on values in @xmath84 .",
    "we assume that the elements of any of the spaces @xmath88 , ( resp .",
    "@xmath89 , or @xmath90 ) are differentiable with respect to @xmath91 as many times as needed .",
    "we refer to mclean  @xcite and also monk  @xcite for properties of the above spaces , and related density results .",
    "next , we derive a weak form which was shown to us by d.  n.  arnold  @xcite .",
    "we introduce @xmath92 such that @xmath93 this is an auxiliary variable associated with the constraint that @xmath24 is divergence - free .",
    "if the initial condition for @xmath24 is divergence - free , then as shown below , @xmath94 is zero for all times .",
    "however , if the initial guess is not divergence - free , then @xmath94 does not have to be zero .",
    "first , multiply equations   and by test functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively . next ,",
    "integrate by parts and use boundary conditions   and the identities @xmath97 to obtain for all @xmath95 , and for all @xmath96 , @xmath98 finally , we get the following variational problem : + find @xmath99 , such that for all @xmath100 and for all @xmath101 , @xmath102 at @xmath103 , the following initial conditions are needed , @xmath104 here , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and we assume that @xmath107 is divergence - free . as it is well known , this assumption implies that @xmath25 is divergence - free for all @xmath101 .    regarding the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the variational problem ,   , we point out that in the case of a perfect conductor , solution results for lipschitz polyhedra are found in pauly and rossi  @xcite and also in birman and solomyak  @xcite . however , for the dissipative boundary conditions we consider and for lipschitz polyhedral domains , to our best knowledge , there are no results on existence and uniqueness . for solution results on smooth domains ( @xmath108 )",
    "we refer to the monograph by petkov  @xcite , where the general case of symmetric hyperbolic systems is considered and existence and uniqueness are derived using semigroup theory . for lipschitz polyhedral domains it is not straightforward and difficult to see that the solution is related to a contraction semigroup .",
    "next , the following proposition shows that for a divergence - free @xmath109 , the variational form satisfies the divergence - free condition for @xmath24 weakly for all time .",
    "[ prop : weakly - div - free ] let @xmath110 satisfy equations   and the initial conditions  .",

    "the condition @xmath129 comes from integrating by parts and noting that @xmath122 vanishes on the boundary .",
    "then , from , the desired result for @xmath24 follows.@xmath130    next , we show an energy estimate .",
    "[ the - only - proposition ] let @xmath110 satisfy equations   and the initial conditions  .",

    "to devise a discretization of   , we approximate the exterior of the sphere by a polyhedral domain , which is decomposed as a union of simplices ( tetrahedrons ) . the polyhedral domain and its splitting is obtained by mapping a corresponding splitting of a cube to a polyhedron with vertices on the sphere .",
    "we consider a cube @xmath136 and we split it into @xmath137 cubes each with side length @xmath138 . here",
    "@xmath139 , for some @xmath140 . from this partition",
    ", we remove all cubes that have nonempty intersection with the open cube @xmath141 .",
    "finally , we split each of the cubes from the lattice into 6 tetrahedrons and this gives a partitioning of @xmath142 into simplices .",
    "note that this partition has the same vertices as the lattice and @xmath143 from this , we obtain a polyhedron approximating the region between two spheres by mapping every vertex of the lattice with polar coordinates @xmath144 to @xmath145 .",
    "clearly this maps the interior boundary of @xmath142 to the unit sphere , and the outer boundary to a sphere with radius @xmath27 .",
    "an example is shown in figures  [ fig : cube][fig : sphere ] .",
    "we note that when @xmath146 the corresponding polyhedron approximates the region between the spheres .              for the discrete problem , we use standard piecewise linear continuous elements paired with ndlec @xcite finite - element spaces .",
    "we introduce the spaces @xmath147 , and @xmath148 and the fe solution is denoted by @xmath149 .",
    "more precisely , we define @xmath150 the space @xmath151 is a properly chosen subspace of @xmath152 , which is orthogonal to the gradients of the _ discrete _ harmonic forms ( but not necessarily to @xmath81 ) . this intermediate space is defined as @xmath153 next , the discrete harmonic form , @xmath154 , is defined as the unique piecewise linear continuous function satisfying @xmath155 then , @xmath156 in the definitions above , @xmath157 are constant vectors for every simplex @xmath158 in the partition and @xmath159 .    spaces corresponding to the time - dependent problem are analogously defined using the definitions from the previous section .",
    "we denote these spaces by @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath163 implies that the tangential components of @xmath164 are continuous .",
    "the other spaces induce certain compatibility conditions as well .",
    "for example , the requirement @xmath165 in the definition of the space @xmath161 at the beginning of section  [ subsect : fe ] is equivalent to saying that the _ normal _ components of the elements from @xmath161 are continuous across element faces .",
    "it is also easy to check that @xmath166 in the definition above implies that @xmath122 is a continuous function ( because it is a piecewise polynomial function , which is in @xmath167 ) .",
    "finally , it is important to note that equations   make sense for all @xmath168 . as stated above , the piecewise polynomial functions on tetrahedral partitions of @xmath29 are in @xmath71 if their tangential components across the faces are continuous .",
    "such functions , however , do not necessarily have continuous normal component across the faces of the tetrahedrons .",
    "thus , the approximation @xmath169 to @xmath24 is not in @xmath68 even though @xmath170 .      after constructing the approximating spaces , the discrete problem is constructed by restricting the bilinear form onto the piecewise polynomial spaces . in the following",
    ", we set @xmath171 because we are interested only in the dependence of the solution on initial conditions . denoting @xmath172 and restricting   to @xmath173",
    "leads to the following approximate variational problem : find @xmath174 such that for all @xmath175 @xmath176 in the following , the superscript @xmath138 is omitted , since the considerations in the rest of the paper are focused on the discrete problem in @xmath177 .",
    "we also interchangeably use @xmath178 and @xmath179 and , similarly , @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "an operator is introduced , such that @xmath182 via the bilinear forms in  . for @xmath183 and @xmath184 , set @xmath185 corresponding to the boundary term , we also have the operator associated with the impedance boundary condition , @xmath186 since we are now on a finite - dimensional space , we write the semi - discrete problem ( discretized in space and continuous in time ) as a constant coefficient linear system of odes , i.e. @xmath187 from the definitions of @xmath188 and @xmath189 it is obvious that @xmath188 is skew symmetric and @xmath189 is symmetric and positive semi - definite .",
    "we now show that the assembly of system can be constructed using only mass ( gramm ) matrices formed with the bases in @xmath190 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 spaces and incidence matrices , whose entries encode the relationships `` vertex incident to an edge '' , `` edge incident to a face '' , etc .",
    "the aim of this section is to provide some insight into the implementation of such finite - element schemes and also to set the stage for presenting the crank  nicholson discretization in time .",
    "we start with a description of the standard ( canonical ) bases in @xmath192 , @xmath191 , and @xmath151 , respectively . by boundary vertices , edges , and faces we mean vertices , edges , and faces lying on the boundary , @xmath193 . for an edge",
    ", this means that both its end vertices are on the boundary and for a face it means that all three of its vertices are on the boundary .",
    "the remaining vertices , ( edges , faces ) are designated as interior vertices ( edges , faces ) .",
    "we note that by a standard convention , it is assumed that for the triangulation in hand the directions of vectors tangential to edges and normal to faces are fixed once and for all .",
    "it is easy and straightforward to check that a change in these directions does not change the considerations that follow .",
    "we then have the following sets of degrees of freedom ( dofs ) :    * dofs corresponding to the set of interior vertices @xmath194 : a functional ( also denoted by @xmath195 ) is associated with an interior vertex @xmath195 as @xmath196 for a sufficiently smooth function , @xmath122 . *",
    "dofs corresponding to the set of all interior edges and all edges on @xmath50 : for a sufficiently smooth vector - valued function , @xmath164 , and an edge , @xmath197 , the associated functional is @xmath198 , where @xmath199 is the unit vector tangential to the edge .",

    "* dofs corresponding to the set of interior faces , @xmath200 : for a sufficiently smooth vector - valued function , @xmath164 , and a face @xmath201 , the associated functional is @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the unit vector normal to the face .    as bases for the spaces @xmath192 , @xmath151 , and @xmath191 we take the piecewise polynomial functions , which are dual to the functionals given above . for the space @xmath192 , we denote these functions by @xmath204 .",
    "they are piecewise linear , continuous , and satisfy @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is the kroneker delta .",
    "the bases for the other two spaces @xmath151 and @xmath191 are then given in terms of the basis for @xmath192 .",

    "we then have the following canonical representations of functions in @xmath212 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 : @xmath213 for functions that also depend on time , i.e. for the elements of @xmath212 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 , we have similar representations with coefficients depending on time as well .",
