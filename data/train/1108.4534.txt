    "compelling evidence in favor of neutrino oscillations has been accumulated from a number of solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments since 1998 @xcite .",
    "we are now convinced that the three known neutrinos have nonzero and nondegenerate masses , and their flavor states can convert from one kind to another . in particular , two neutrino mass - squared differences @xmath4 and two flavor mixing angles @xmath20 have been determined to a reasonably good degree of accuracy from currently available experimental data . in spite of this progress made in neutrino physics , our quantitative knowledge about the properties of massive neutrinos",
    "remain quite incomplete  for instance , the absolute mass scale of three neutrinos , the sign of @xmath21 and the smallest flavor mixing angle @xmath0 are still unknown . although the nature of massive neutrinos is also an open question , we assume them to be the majorana particles . in this case the @xmath22 majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath1 is symmetric , and the corresponding @xmath22 flavor mixing matrix @xmath23 contains three cp - violating phases @xmath24 which are entirely unrestricted by current experimental data .",
    "the t2k @xcite and minos @xcite accelerator neutrino experiments have recently announced their preliminary data on the appearance @xmath25 oscillation , which hints at a relatively large value of @xmath0 .",
    "if this mixing angle is confirmed to be not very small by new data from these two experiments and from the upcoming reactor antineutrino experiments ( e.g. , the double chooz experiment in france @xcite , the daya bay experiment in china @xcite and the reno experiment in korea @xcite ) , it will be a great news to the long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments which aim at a determination of the sign of @xmath21 and the magnitude of the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath26 .",
    "the observed values of relevant neutrino flavor parameters may then allow us to reconstruct the majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath1 in the flavor basis where the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath27 is diagonal : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 with @xmath30 ( for @xmath31 ) being the neutrino masses , and @xmath23 is just the @xmath22 neutrino mixing matrix .    in the lack of a convincing flavor theory ,",
    "at least five approaches have so far been tried to study the flavor problems of massive neutrinos @xcite : ( a ) radiative mechanisms , ( b ) texture zeros , ( c ) flavor symmetries , ( d ) seesaw mechanisms , and ( e ) extra dimensions . some of them are certainly correlative .",
    "for example , the neutrino mass matrix @xmath1 may have a few texture zeros as a natural consequence of an underlying flavor symmetry in a given model with or without the seesaw mechanism .",
    "such texture zeros are phenomenologically useful in the sense that they guarantee the calculability of @xmath1 from which both the neutrino mass spectrum and the flavor mixing pattern can more or less be predicted .",
    "note that texture zeros of a fermion mass matrix dynamically mean that the corresponding matrix elements are sufficiently suppressed in comparison with their neighboring counterparts @xcite , and they can help us to establish some simple and testable relations between flavor mixing angles and fermion mass ratios  if such relations turn out to be favored by the experimental data , they might have a fundamental reason and should originate from the underlying flavor theory .",
    "hence a phenomenological study of possible texture zeros of @xmath1 _ does _ make a lot of sense .",
    "as @xmath1 is symmetric , it has six independent complex entries . if @xmath32 of them are taken to be vanishing ( i.e. , @xmath1 has @xmath32 independent texture zeros ) , then we shall arrive at @xmath33 different textures .",
    "it is easy to show that a texture of @xmath1 with more than two independent zeros ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) is definitely incompatible with current experimental data on neutrino masses and flavor mixing angles @xcite .",
    "hence a number of authors have paid particular interest to the two - zero textures of @xmath1 @xcite@xcite .",
    "have much less predictability than the two - zero textures of @xmath1 , and their phenomenological implications have been discussed in ref .",
    "] there are totally fifteen two - zero textures of @xmath1 , which can be classified into six categories : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 in which each  @xmath41 \" denotes a nonzero matrix element .",
    "previous analyses of these fifteen patterns ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) led us to the following conclusions : ( 1 ) seven patterns ( i.e. , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) were phenomenologically favored ; ( 2 ) two patterns ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) were only marginally allowed ; and ( 3 ) six patterns ( i.e. , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) were ruled out .",
    "taking account of the latest t2k and minos neutrino oscillation data , one may wonder whether the above conclusions remain true or not .",
    "a fast check tells us that patterns @xmath48 can be ruled out by today s experimental data at the @xmath9 level , simply because @xmath49 is no more favored .",
    "in addition , patterns @xmath46 and @xmath47 remain phenomenologically disfavored .",
    "the question turns out to be whether patterns @xmath6 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 can survive current experimental tests and coincide with a relatively large value of @xmath0 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is just to answer this question .",
    "we aim to perform a very systematic study of the aforementioned seven patterns of @xmath1 with two independent texture zeros based on a global fit of current neutrino oscillation data done by fogli _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "therefore , we shall mainly use the @xmath9 results of @xcite in our numerical calculations . ] because a two - zero texture of @xmath1 is very simple and can reveal the salient phenomenological features of a given majorana neutrino mass matrix , we intend to take such a systematic analysis as a good example to show how to test possible textures of @xmath1 by confronting them with more and more accurate experimental data .",
    "hence this work is different from any of the previous ones . in particular ,",
    "almost all the physical consequences of patterns @xmath6 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are explored in an analytical way in the present work ; the stability of texture zeros and the permutation symmetry between two similar patterns are discussed ; the numerical analysis is most updated and more complete ; and a realization of texture zeros by mean of certain flavor symmetries is illustrated .",
    "we find that patterns @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 of @xmath1 can all survive current experimental tests at the @xmath9 level , but we believe that some of them are likely to be ruled out in the near future .    the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we show that the full neutrino mass spectrum and two majorana cp - violating phases @xmath50 can all be determined in terms of three flavor mixing angles @xmath51 and the dirac cp - violating phase ( @xmath26 ) for a given two - zero texture of @xmath1 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a complete analytical analysis of patterns @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 of @xmath1 , and to some discussions about the stability of texture zeros against the one - loop quantum corrections and the permutation symmetry between two similar patterns under consideration . with the help of current neutrino oscillation data",
    "we perform a detailed numerical analysis of those typical patterns of @xmath1 in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to some discussions about how to realize texture zeros of @xmath1 by means of certain flavor symmetries , and section 6 is a summary of this work together with some concluding remarks .",
    "in the flavor basis where the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath27 is diagonal , the majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath1 can be reconstructed in terms of three neutrino masses @xmath52 and the flavor mixing matrix @xmath23 .",
    "namely , @xmath53 it is convenient to express @xmath23 as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes a @xmath22 unitary matrix consisting of three flavor mixing angles ( @xmath56 ) and one dirac cp - violating phase ( @xmath26 ) , and @xmath57 is a diagonal phase matrix containing two majorana cp - violating phases ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "more explicitly , we adopt the parametrization @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( for @xmath62 ) are defined . the neutrino mass matrix @xmath1 can equivalently be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . if two independent elements of @xmath1 are vanishing ( i.e. , @xmath67 with @xmath68 ) as shown in eqs .",
