    "self - consistent cranking ( scc ) is one of the most popular methods to study collective rotations in nuclear many - body systems @xcite . within the hartree - fock framework",
    ", it has provided important insights into the backbending phenomena , and currently , it is being used actively in studies of superdeformed nuclei  @xcite . in stark contrast",
    ", it has been rarely used in the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is only one application of scc to ibm where a study of moment of inertia ( moi ) is carried out  @xcite . in the early stages of the model ,",
    "an obvious reason for this neglect was the availability of exact results ( either via dynamical symmetries or numerical diagonalization ) , which left little room for development of approximate methods such as scc .",
    "in later extensions of the ibm ( e.g.  @xmath1-ibm ) , dynamical symmetries were not very useful , and numerical diagonalization could not be carried out due to large basis space , hence alternative methods were needed . at around the same time , however , an exact angular momentum projection technique was developed for axially symmetric boson systems ( @xmath3 expansion @xcite ) , which provided analytical solutions for general hamiltonians in large basis spaces , filling the gap left by the other methods . although the assumption of axial symmetry is reasonable for most deformed nuclei in their ground states , triaxial effects are known to play a role , especially at high - spins @xcite .",
    "therefore a study of the evolution of shapes in the ibm would be useful in order to investigate such questions as the effects of triaxiality in nuclear spectra , ways of incorporating it in the ibm hamiltonian , and whether an improved description of spectra can be obtained if triaxial effects are taken into account .    in this paper",
    ", we first present tests of the scc by comparing the cranking calculations with the exact results obtained in the su(3 ) and o(6 ) limits , as well as from diagonalization of more realistic hamiltonians in the @xmath0-ibm .",
    "the scc method is then used in a study of triaxiality in the ibm both in the @xmath0 and @xmath1-boson versions of the model .",
    "the scc in the ibm was formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite to which we refer for details , especially concerning the construction of the intrinsic state and the symmetries it possesses . for a given ibm hamiltonian @xmath4 and intrinsic state @xmath5 ,",
    "the scc around the @xmath6-axis is described by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath6-component of the angular momentum operator , @xmath9 is the boson number and @xmath10 are the variational parameters to be determined from the extremum condition . for convenience ,",
    "we consider a general formulation of the ibm which will be tailored to specific cases later .",
    "thus , we introduce the boson creation and annihilation operators @xmath11 with @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , etc .",
    "the intrinsic state is given by a condensate of intrinsic bosons as @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the normalized boson mean fields , i.e. @xmath18 . due to the symmetries in the cranked system @xcite , @xmath17 are real and @xmath19 .",
    "note that the odd-@xmath20 components of @xmath17 vanish in the static limit ( @xmath21 ) , but not in general .",
    "thus , invoking the normalization condition ( e.g.  setting @xmath22 ) , there are 3 independent variational parameters in the @xmath0-ibm ( @xmath23 ) and 5 more in the @xmath1-ibm ( @xmath24 ) . for the ibm hamiltonian",

    "note that both results are independent of @xmath9 , and the constancy of moi simply follows from the fact that @xmath47 is quadratic in @xmath74 in both cases .",
    "the scc leads to a constant moi in the su(3 ) limit , as expected from a rigid rotor , but deviates from the exact result by about 5% .",

    "we will comment on these deviations further when discussing the @xmath9 dependence of the results below .",
    "the case with @xmath77 falls in between the two dynamical symmetry results .",
    "the dynamical moi increases with @xmath42 as in a typical deformed nucleus ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , though the overall magnitude is still too large .",
    "the deviation between the cranking and the exact results in this case is comparable to that in the su(3 ) limit , with the error getting smaller at higher frequencies . when a @xmath51-boson energy with @xmath60 is included in the hamiltonian , which fits the observed range of moi data better , the agreement between the cranking and exact results improve markedly , especially at lower frequencies .",
    "the scc is a semi - classical theory and it would be exact in the classical limit when @xmath78 . thus to understand the nature of discrepancies seen in fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] and eqs .",
    "( [ line1 ] , [ line2 ] ) that the scc calculation of @xmath75 is correct to leading order but fails in higher orders in @xmath3 by generating spurious correction terms . a comparison of eq .",
    "( [ sde ] ) with the accurate angular - momentum - projected result @xcite confirms that the incorrect treatment of the @xmath3 terms in the scc is the cause of the discrepancy .",
    "it is interesting to note that an agreement is obtained if one uses the casimir operator of the su(3 ) given by @xmath81 , instead of just @xmath82 . in this case , the incorrect @xmath3 contribution from the @xmath82 interaction is exactly canceled by the spurious contribution from the @xmath83 term .",
    "another interesting observation is that the best agreement of scc with the exact results is achieved in the realistic case with @xmath77 and @xmath60 .",
    "this happens because the @xmath3 term is now dominated by the leading contribution from @xmath84 , which is correctly treated in the scc .",
    "the errors from @xmath84 contribute at the @xmath85 level , and these become apparent only at the high - rotational frequencies as is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "we next study the effects of triaxiality in scc .",
    "it is well known that the energy surface of an @xmath0-ibm hamiltonian with one- and two - body interactions has an axially symmetric minima in the deformed phase @xcite .",
    "an exception occurs in the o(6 ) limit , where a @xmath2-unstable shape develops .",
    "the scc calculations in the o(6 ) limit give @xmath86 for both the average @xmath2 ( [ gam1 ] ) and its fluctuations ( [ gam2 ] ) at all frequencies .",
    "thus the scc results are consistent with the description of the o(6 ) limit using a triaxial intrinsic state with @xmath87 , which has a very shallow minimum in the @xmath2 direction @xcite .",
    "frequency independence of the results corroborates with the fact that the o(6 ) states remain @xmath2-unstable at all spins . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show the evolution of the triaxiality angle @xmath2 with the cranking frequency for the remaining three cases discussed above for three different boson numbers , @xmath71 , 15 , 20 .",
    "results obtained from both eq .",
    "( [ gam1 ] ) ( solid line ) and ( [ gam2 ] ) ( dashed line ) are shown . the ground band in the su(3 )",
    "limit can be described exactly by angular momentum projection from an axially symmetric intrinsic state , therefore , both average @xmath2 and its fluctuations should vanish at _ all _ frequencies . the scc results ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , left ) start with @xmath88 at low @xmath42 but deviate from it systematically with increasing frequency .",
    "although the situation appears to be improving with increasing @xmath9 , similar to the case in @xmath89 , in fact , this is merely due to the extension of the spectrum with @xmath9 ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "if one scales out the @xmath9 dependence ( i.e. , plots @xmath2 against @xmath91 ) , then all the curves with different @xmath9 overlap . thus @xmath2 can be written as a power expansion in @xmath91 with the leading ( @xmath9 independent ) term being zero .",
    "this situation is similar to that encountered in the study of @xmath75 : the scc gets the leading order term correctly ( @xmath88 ) but fails in higher - orders in @xmath3 by generating spurious terms in powers of @xmath91 .",
    "the fact that the incorrect @xmath3 terms in @xmath2 all depend on the cranking frequency makes the scc results increasingly unreliable at higher frequencies .",
    "the onset of triaxiality observed at around mid - frequency ( @xmath92 ) in all curves in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is thus due the failure of the scc and not a genuine feature of the boson system .",
    "we remark that despite the sudden increase in the calculated @xmath2 values , @xmath75 remains constant in the su(3 ) limit , suggesting that triaxiality has a negligible effect on moi .",
    "we interpret the remaining more realistic cases in the light of the su(3 ) test . in the case of @xmath77 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , middle ) , the average @xmath2 ( solid lines ) remains around zero except at high frequencies .",
    "attributing this sudden rise in @xmath2 to the break down of scc , we see that @xmath93 for all ground - band states of a @xmath82 hamiltonian .",
    "the fluctuations ( dashed lines ) , on the other hand , are non - zero but get smaller with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "the values of fluctuations at @xmath21 are consistent with those obtained from an exact calculation for the ground state @xcite . at higher frequencies",
    "there is a small reduction in fluctuations , that is , rotations have a slightly stabilizing effect on the @xmath2 motion .",
    "increasing the boson number also suppresses fluctuations , which is due to the energy surface becoming deeper in the @xmath2 direction with larger @xmath9 values .",
    "the last case with @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , right ) has broadly the same features .",
    "the one - body term can not induce triaxiality alone , therefore , the small deviation in average @xmath2 from zero at mid - frequencies is presumably due to errors in scc .",
    "there is an increase in fluctuations compared to the middle panel , which can be explained as due to the energy surface becoming shallower with the addition of the one - body term .",
    "these results indicate that rotations have a rather limited effect on the shape variables in the @xmath0-ibm , with average @xmath2 remaining nearly constant at zero , and its fluctuations being slightly reduced from the ground state value at higher spins .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath0-ibm , where numerical diagonalization is a routine task , the @xmath1-ibm already suffers from the large basis problem , and exact diagonalization is not possible for @xmath94 , that is , for most of the deformed nuclei .",
    "the @xmath3 expansion circumvents this problem but because it assumes axial symmetry , one can not use it to address questions on triaxiality . here",

    "<S> the self - consistent cranking method is tested by comparing the cranking calculations in the interacting boson model with the exact results obtained from the su(3 ) and o(6 ) dynamical symmetries and from numerical diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> the method is used to study the spin dependence of shape variables in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson models . </S>",
    "<S> when realistic sets of parameters are used , both models lead to similar results : axial shape is retained with increasing cranking frequency while fluctuations in the shape variable @xmath2 are slightly reduced . </S>"
