    "the linear hadron collider ( lhc ) , with its recent discovery of a 125  gev higgs boson  @xcite , has completed the observation of all fundamental particles of the standard model .",
    "but many questions remain unanswered about the properties of the low energy particle universe .",
    "the origin of neutrino mass and mechanism of family symmetry breaking are the ones that get the most attention , along with that of whether there are more particles to be found as the energy and luminosity of the lhc increases .",
    "we are interested in another question , one that concerns quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the lhc is a qcd machine , and it is likely to provide a unique window to precision qcd .",
    "the anomalous magnetic dipole moments of the electron and the muon are among the most precisely computed and measured quantities in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the corresponding quantity for qcd , the anomalous chromomagnetic dipole moment ( cmdm ) of quarks , is not so precisely known .",
    "starting from a general effective lagrangian containing the anomalous couplings  @xcite , one may look for the contribution of new physics in various processes by analyzing available data .",
    "while some bounds have been obtained this way for the new physics contribution to the cmdm of the top quark  @xcite , this particular quantity has received only sparse attention from the community so far .",
    "indeed , it was only very recently that an experimental collaboration did an analysis of the top - quark cmdm for the first time  @xcite .",
    "even less attention seems to have been paid to the anomalous cmdm of the other quarks , although some calculations have been done for light quarks in the context of computing the contribution of quark cmdm to nucleon anomalous magnetic moments and electromagnetic form factors  @xcite .",
    "as the lhc starts measuring qcd quantities more accurately , we can expect more interest in anomalous chromomagnetic dipole moments , and more generally form factors , of quarks .",
    "another quantity that is likely to be known more precisely through measurements at the lhc is the mass of the gluon .",
    "there is no higgs mechanism for qcd as the color symmetry of the theory is unbroken  @xcite . on the other hand , a proca mass term for the gluon breaks gauge symmetry , leading to a breakdown of renormalizability as well as violation of unitarity at high energy by certain tree level amplitudes .",
    "however , there are some ways a gluon can be massive in a gauge - invariant manner .",
    "one is due to cornwall  @xcite , who suggested that non - zero gluon mass can be generated dynamically in a theory in which the color symmetry remains unbroken .",
    "a dynamically generated gluon mass depends on momentum ; it must also vanish at large momentum so as to maintain renormalizability of the theory .",
    "another model of a massive gluon is the curci - ferrari model  @xcite , which has a proca mass term as well as a ` gauge - fixing ' term , uses a quartic ghost interaction to make it renormalizable ( but not unitary )  @xcite .",
    "another is the topological mass generation mechanism  @xcite , in which an antisymmetric tensor provides a mass to the gauge boson via a derivative coupling without breaking global or gauge symmetries .",
    "this model also appears to be unitary and renormalizable  @xcite .",
    "early analyses led to estimates of the gluon mass over a large range , from @xmath1  mev  @xcite using numerical calculations of the mass gap , to @xmath2  mev  @xcite on the basis of strong suppression of the end point of the photon spectrum in radiative @xmath3 decays , to @xmath4  gev  @xcite based on analysis of photon spectra in the processes @xmath5 and @xmath6 more recently , an analysis of data from free quark searches found a nominal upper limit of @xmath7 mev  @xcite .",
    "it is clear from these studies that the question of whether the gluon has a mass is yet to be settled experimentally .",
    "we can expect that precision measurements of qcd quantities , such as the anomalous cmdm , will lead to setting bounds on gluon mass .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the anomalous cmdm of quarks at one - loop order , assuming a small mass ( @xmath8 mev ) for the gluon .",
    "let us first describe what we plan to calculate , and the notation and conventions that we will use .",
    "the piece of the lagrangian which governs the quark - gluon coupling for a non - zero value of the anomalous cmdm is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the quark and @xmath11 denotes the gluon , @xmath12 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath13 are the usual su(3)@xmath14 generators , and @xmath15 is the quark mass .",
    "we will call @xmath16 the cmdm , corresponding to a momentum transfer @xmath17 . for future reference , we mention here that in  @xcite , which calculated the cmdm of the top quark , a quantity @xmath18 was defined by @xmath19 and referred to as the cmdm of the quark .    the form factor @xmath16 receives contributions from both strong and electroweak processes .",
    "the lowest order qcd contribution comes from two different feynman diagrams , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.strong ] . for the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig.qed ] the external gluon directly couples to the fermion line in the loop , similar to the analogous process of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the other diagram , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 g ] , is purely non - abelian in nature , with the external gluon coupling to internal gluons .",
    "the electroweak contribution to the cmdm comes from loops containing the exchange of electroweak gauge bosons @xmath20 , or the higgs boson . using the observed value of the higgs boson mass , @xmath21 gev  @xcite completely fixes the contribution from the electroweak sector .",
    "the relevant vertex corrections at the lowest order come from the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.weak ] .    to begin with",
    ", we focus our attention on @xmath22 , calculating this quantity for all quarks and for varying gluon mass between 0 and 10 mev . an analytical calculation of the anomalous cmdm was done in  @xcite and later in  @xcite .",
    "also see  @xcite for a different method of calculation .",
    "apart from the use of a massive gluon propagator , there is another significant way by which our calculations and results differ from those in these papers .",
    "the results and calculations in these papers were done for zero momentum exchange , i.e. @xmath23 whereas we do the calculations for a general @xmath24 for @xmath25 the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig.3 g ] produces a divergent contribution to the cmdm for vanishing gluon mass .",
    "while it is possible to get rid of this infrared divergence if we work with zero gluon mass from the beginning , this diagram can not be subtracted out if the physical gluon has a mass",
    ". then this diagram contributes to the total , and @xmath26 diverges as the gluon mass is taken to zero .",
    "we will argue below that perturbative @xmath22 is not a physically sensible quantity anyway , and what we should be interested in is @xmath27 for large values of @xmath28 .",
    "we note here that while a calculation for the anomalous cmdm was given in  @xcite , those calculations appear to be incorrect .",
    "specifically , the numerical results given in  @xcite are in severe disagreement with the calculations given in the appendix of the same paper , one being finite and the other divergent .",
    "the results and calculations are both in disagreement with ours .",
    "our results for @xmath29 at @xmath25 appear to agree with those in  @xcite , whose result for fig .",
    "[ fig.3 g ] also diverges at @xmath30 but vanishes for vanishing quark mass , as does ours .",

    "there will also be a term proportional to @xmath35 in the propagator , the actual form of the term depending on the theory that provides a mass to the gluon .",
    "but in the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig.strong ] , each internal gluon line couples to a conserved @xmath36 current at least at one end .",
    "so this term will not contribute in these diagrams .",

    "discussions about the anomalous chromomagnetic dipole moment in the literature have focused only on the top quark because it is larger in magnitude than for the other quarks .",
    "we have corrected the existing results for the top quark at @xmath25 and also given results at the @xmath31 mass .",
    "it is also seen from our results that the anomalous chromomagnetic dipole moments of the other heavy quarks at may have measurable values at @xmath105 as well .",
