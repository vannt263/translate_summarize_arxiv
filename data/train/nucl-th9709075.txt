    "interesting information about the early stage of the collision is in this case hidden by subsequent collective effects of strongly interacting hadrons .    fortunately other particles - leptons and photons produced in all stages of hic process , are not influenced by the later hadronic phase .",
    "thus distributions of leptons and photons can provide us with more or less direct information about the early stages of the collision process .",
    "recent experimental results on invariant mass distribution of dilepton pairs @xcite have attracted increased attention due to the observed excess of dilepton yield at regions @xmath0gev ( na50 ) and @xmath1 gev ( ceres ) . theoretical analysis on dilepton pair production @xcite leads to the conclusion that unconventional production mechanisms ( e.g. modified @xmath2-meson mass @xcite or in - medium pion dispersion relation @xcite ) are necessary to explain present experimental data .    in this contribution",
    "specific results of the computer simulation of dilepton pairs production from expanding pion gas are presented . besides the invariant mass distribution of the produced dileptons also other properties of the dileptonic signal produced from the pion gas via @xmath3 annihilation channel are analyzed .",
    "short description of the computer simulation is given in next section .",
    "influence of the finite size of pion gas ( and its initial state ) on invariant mass spectrum of dileptons is discussed in section 3 using results of the computer simulation . in section 4 rapidity distribution of dilepton pairs obtained from the simulation",
    "is presented .",

    "second - order azimuthal asymmetry in the transversal momentum distribution of dileptons is predicted by the simulation of non - central pb+pb 160 gev / n collisions in section 5 .",
    "possible consequences of the effects found and presented here on other areas of hic research are scetched at the end of this paper .",
    "for the simulation of dilepton production from the expanding pion gas rescattering model @xcite ( inspired by the model of t.j.humanic @xcite ) was used .",
    "initial stage of pion gas in pb+pb 160 gev / n collisions ( positions , momenta and time of creation of pions ) was taken from events generated by cascade program @xcite . in the rescattering program pions",

    "distribution function @xmath17 is calculated by rescattering program in our case .",
    "it depends mainly on the isospin averaged cross section @xmath19 for elastic @xmath20 interaction which regulates scattering of pions and it is influenced also by formation time @xmath21 and interaction time @xmath22 parameters of the rescattering model used @xcite .    after multiplying and dividing right - hand side of eq.([ee1 ] ) by @xmath23 and integrating over @xmath24 the rate of dileptons from the pion gas can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is distribution of @xmath27 collisions as a function of invariant mass @xmath28 of the colliding @xmath27 pairs and @xmath29 denotes ratio of the number of @xmath30 collisions to all @xmath20 interactions .",
    "distribution @xmath26 is calculated by the rescattering program .",

    "was multiplied by factor 13000 in the rescattering program and pairs of pions were tested ( in each time step ) for the critical distance @xmath33 calculated from this enlarged cross section : @xmath34    when this condition is fulfilled for a given pair of pions invariant mass @xmath28 and momenta of pions @xmath35 are remembered ( stored into file ) .",
    "positions and momenta of pions fulfilling condition ( [ dce ] ) are left unchanged in the program . in this way probability for the process of pion annihilation",
    "is enhanced to the level comparable with the elastic pion - pion interactions . at the same time process of the expansion of pion gas is not influenced by this high probability of pion - pion annihilitaion because pions are not annihilated finally .",
    "just possibility of this process is recorded .",
    "results obtained by the above described two independent methods of dilepton production simulation were nearly identical in all features ( invariant mass distribution , @xmath36 distribution , azimuthal and rapidity distribution ) tested so far .",
    "invariant mass distribution of dilepton pairs produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions can be divided into separate regions .",
    "dileptons with invariant mass @xmath37 gev are produced mainly in the process of parton - parton annihilation .",
    "region of @xmath28 below 300 mev is dominated by dalitz decays of @xmath38 and @xmath39 mesons .",
    "also electromagnetic bremsstrahlung contributes to this low mass region of dilelectron pairs .",

    ". this list of dilepton production channels would be incomplete if we did not mention dileptons from decays of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and couples of @xmath45 mesons .",
    "@xmath3 annihilation channel of dilepton production plays important role in the case of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions due to high multiplicities of secondary produced pions ( above 2000 in central pb+pb 160 gev / n collisions ) .",
    "0.25 cm    1.7pt    0.15 cm    in this section invariant mass spectra of dileptons originating from @xmath3 annihilation generated by the rescattering simulation are presented . in the paper @xcite",
    "mainly influence of formation time parameter on the shape of dilepton spectrum was investigated . here",
    "dependence of the dilepton mass spectrum on the initial state of the pion gas is studied .",
    "initial momenta and positions of pions in events produced by cascade generator @xcite are uncorrelated .",
    "it means that momentum of the pion does not depend on coordinates of its creation e.g. in transversal plane .",
    "invariant mass spectrum obtained for these @xmath46 uncorrelated events is shown on fig.2a ) .",
    "thick line on fig.2a ) is obtained for same values of @xmath47 and @xmath22 parameters of the rescattering model but for @xmath46 correlated events .",
    "these events were obtained by the following modification of events produced by cascade generator @xcite : for each pion scalar product of its transversal momentum and position in transversal plane @xmath48 was evaluated . in the case of negative numerical value of the scalar product ,",
    "position of the pion @xmath49 was replaced by the oposit position in transversal plane @xmath50 . in this way momentum - space correlation",
    "was generated in the initial state of pion gas .",
    "momenta of pions ( not changed ) are oriented predominantely out from the center of transversal plane .",
    "resulting invariant mass spectrum of dileptons calculated for @xmath46 correlated events differs significantly from the spectrum of uncorrelated events .",
    "low mass dilepton pairs are strongly enhanced in the case of @xmath46 correlated events . in fig.2b",
    "influence of formation time parameter @xmath21 on invariant mass spectrum of dileptons is shown for @xmath46 correlated events .",
    "small values of formation time parameter enhance production of dilepton pairs in @xmath40-meson region as it was found and discussed paper @xcite .    what is physical origin of the low mass dilepton enhancement in the case of @xmath46 correlated events ? why non - zero values of formation time suppress dilepton pairs in @xmath40-mass region compared to the low mass region pairs ?",
    "two independent effects originating from the finite size of pion gas can serve as explanation .",
    "first one was already discussed in the work @xcite .",
    "this consideration is reproduced very shortly here .",
    "formation time @xcite excludes pions from the rescattering process and therefore also from the possibility of annihilation into dilepton pairs .",
    "faster pions are forbidden to interact for longer time due to the lorentz dilation of the formation time implemented in the rescattering program .",
    "due to the finite size of the pion gas faster pions can escape from the interaction region without any rescattering or annihilation .",
    "thus invariant mass spectrum if dileptons is enhanced at low mass region by interactions of slow pions .    at the same time",
    "another mechanism also resulting from finite size of the expanding pion gas influences invariant mass spectrum of dileptons .",
    "invariant mass quantity depends not only on the total size of momenta of pions being scattered but also on the angle between the momenta :    @xmath51    for small values of scattering angle @xmath42 , it means for pions moving in parallel directions , invariant mass quantitiy ( [ mfi ] ) is small .",
    "at the same time for pions moving in oposit directions invariant mass is large for the same values of momenta of pions .",
    "this effect can play significant role if the mean free path of interacting particles is comparable with the initial size of the expanding gas .",
    "this seems to be the case of the pion gas created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "momentum - space correlation leads to the higher probability of collisions with small scattering angles and therefore it enhances production of low mass dileptons ( see fig.2a ) .",
    "in the case of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions momentum - space correlation at the initial stage of pion gas can be generated also by transversal flow in prehadronic phase .",
    "rapidity distribution of dilepton pairs produced by pion annihilation is determined by rapidity distribution of momentum sum @xmath52 of anninhilating pions ( @xmath53,@xmath54 are momenta of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "this quantity is conserved in the process of @xmath3 annihilation , @xmath57 . in fig.3a ) and b ) rapidity distributions of pions before and after the rescattering process are shown .",
    "rapidity distribution of pions is not influenced significantly by the rescattering process . however resulting rapidity distribution of dilepton pairs exhibits unexpected minimum at midrapidity surrounded by two maxima .",
    "0.25 cm    1.7pt    0.15 cm    the result shown on fig.3 is obtained for the simulation of pb+pb 160 gev / n events with values of rescattering model parameters @xmath58 fm / c , @xmath59 fm / c . in this case",
    "number of collisions per pion is close to 1.0 and minimum in the rapidity distribution of dileptons is strongest .",
    "for higher collision rates ( obtained for smaller vaues of @xmath60 and @xmath22 parameters ) the minimum is significantly smaller . for number of collisions per pion above 10 coll/@xmath61 the minimum disappeares at all .",
    "such behaviour indicates that the minimum in the rapidity distribution of dileptons is generated by non - equilibrium process in the expanding pion gas .",
    "this effect is studied in phd work @xcite .    from experimental point of view data on rapidity distribution of dileptons produced in @xmath62 or @xmath63",
    "collisions are rather rare .",
    "it is not excluded that the only rapidity distribution of dileptons which seem to originate from @xmath3 annihilation was obtained in pioneering experiments of dls collaboration at bevalac accelerator in berkeley @xcite .",
    "azimuthal asymmetries in transverse momentum distributions of particles have been clearly identified in ultrarelativistic @xcite non - central heavy ion collisions .",
    "this phenomenon is well understood as a consequence of collective behaviour of nuclear matter or explained by absorption of secondary produced particles in the spectator matter @xcite .",
    "recently also azimuthal asymmetries in transverse momentum distributions of less abundant hadrons - @xmath64 mesons and @xmath65 baryons @xcite have been identified in hic experiments .",
    "however azimuthal asymmetries in transversal momentum distribution of dileptons have been addressed neither experimentally nor theoretically so far .",
    "0.15 cm    1.7pt    0.15 cm    from theoretical point of view main mechanisms generating azimuthal asymmetries in transversal momentum distributions of hadrons are not applicable for dileptons .",
    "dileptons leave freely collision volume after being produced without any collective final state interactions or absorption process .    in spite of this",
    "the computer simulation described shortly in section 2 predicts significant second - order asymmetry in transversal momentum distribution of dilepton pairs .",
    "result shown in fig.4 was obtained from the simulation of 40 non - central pb+pb 160 gev / n @xmath66 fm events . for each produced dilepton pair orientation of momentum @xmath67 in respect to the reaction plane ( impact parameter ) was determined .",
    "histogram of azimuthal angles @xmath68 of dilepton pairs was filled and significant second order asymmetry was found .",
    "the fit of the histogram shown in fig.4 to the function : @xmath69 \\label{s2}\\ ] ] gave numerical value of the asymmetry coefficient @xmath70 .",
    "corresponding value of @xmath71 parameter ( simplified for our purposes ) used to characterize squeeze - out effect of hadrons at bevalac energies @xcite is : @xmath72    orientation of the reaction plane is parallel to @xmath73 axis in our simulation , azimuthal asymmetry of dileptons is oriented in the reaction plane . from the analysis of second order asymmetry in the transversal momentum distribution of pions",
    "it comes out @xcite that the asymmetry is strongest for the rate of collisions per pion close to 4.0 coll/@xmath61 .",
    "for higher collision rates strength of the asymmetry decreases though it does not tend to vanish in thermal equilibrium limit .",
    "the same behaviour is expected for the azimuthal asymmetry of dileptons presented here for the first time .",
    "mechanism of generation of the azimuthal asymmetry of dileptons is well understood @xcite at present . the asymmetry is closely related to the spatial distribution of the pion gas in transversal plane which is asymmetrical in non - central events .",
    "two independent methods of the simulation of dilepton production from the expanding pion gas were found to generate nearly identical results .",
    "invariant mass spectrum of dileptons produced via @xmath3 annihilation channel was shown to be sensitive to momentum - space correlation in initial stage of the pion gas .",
    "generated rapidity distribution of dileptons exhibits unexpected minimum at midrapidity . the minimum seems to be a consequence of a non - equilibrium process in the expanding pion gas since it becomes weaker and disappears for higher number of collisions ( above 10 coll/@xmath74 ) in the pion gas .    for non - central collisions",
    "second order asymmetry in azimuthal distribution of dileptons is found .",
    "this asymmetry is a consequence of asymmetrical overlapping region of the colliding nuclei in transversal plane .",
    "azimuthal asymmetry of dileptons might be accessible experimentally if the reaction plane orientation is determined from hadronic signal on dilepton detector .",
    "in this contribution we study expansion of interacting pion gas created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "non - equilibrium and asymmetrical features of the expansion exhibit itself in rapidity and azimuthal distributions of particles participating or created in the rescattering process .",
    "rescattering phenomenon is not related only to the hadronic phase of nuclear matter produced in hic .",
    "it can equally be present also in prehadronic phase where it can lead @xcite to similar effects as those revealed in the pion gas simulation .",
    "investigation of the non - equilibrium expansion of the parton gas possibly created also in non - central collisions might shed light on other interesting aspects @xcite of hic research ."
