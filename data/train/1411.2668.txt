    "the emerging new sequencing platforms , the so - called next - generation sequencing technology , have enabled researchers to generate more sequencing data than ever before with a dramatically reduced cost .",
    "the innovations have already transformed the way biology experiments are carried out . unlike the traditional sanger capillary electrophoresis method using dideoxynucleotide chain - termination , many of these new platforms explore the concept of sequencing by synthesis .",
    "pyrosequencing technique is one of such approaches @xcite . compared with other next - generation sequencing techniques , currently the pyrosequencing technology has the advantage of longer sequence read length , which makes it possible for _ de novo _ sequencing of new genomes . in this paper",
    "we derive the statistical distributions for the pyrosequencing technique .",
    "these distributions are useful for various stages in the use and development of the pyrosequencing technology , such as instrument development and testing , algorithm and software development , and the everyday machine performance monitoring and trouble - shooting .",
    "the distribution of the number of flow cycles for sequences with fixed length and the distribution of sequence length at fixed number of flow cycles are obtained . in both cases",
    "the distributions can be approximated quite accurately by normal distributions with the same mean and variance as the exact distributions .",
    "we obtained the distributions by using the method of probability generating functions ( gfs ) , which in turn were obtained by using the recurrence relations between the probabilities at different sequence lengths and flow cycles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first in the remaining of this _ introduction _ section we give a brief description of the pyrosequencing technique , which is useful for the subsequent theoretical developments .",
    "we also define the necessary notation here .",
    "the derivation of the main results , which are exact under the assumptions of the sequence model , will be presented in the _ bivariate generating functions _ section .",
    "after that , we present the explicit formulas for the mean and variance of the distributions , for both fixed number of cycles and fixed sequences length . we show that the exact distributions can be approximated accurately by normal distributions with the same mean and variance calculated from these formulas .",
    "these explicit formulas would be most useful for the practitioners in the field .",
    "we also present the results for individual flows ( the four different nucleotides ) in this section .",
    "pyrosequencing protocol is based on the detection of the pyrophosphate ( ppi ) that is released during dna synthesis . in most of the current systems ,",
    "several enzymes are involved in the chemical reactions .",
    "the protocol adds the four kinds of nucleotides ( datp , dctp , dgtp , and dttp ) stepwise and iteratively , with one kind of nucleotide at a time . for each nucleotide flow , if the added nucleotide is complementary to the dna template being sequenced , the added nucleotide is incorporated by polymerase . inorganic ppi is released as a result of the polymerization reaction , which is converted to atp by atp sulfurylase .",
    "the atp provides energy for luciferase to oxidize luciferin and to generate detectable light quantitatively .",
    "because we know which nucleotide is added at each nucleotide flow , the dna sequence of the template can be determined by the presence or absence of the emitted light and the intensity of the emitted light .",
    "the detected light is usually presented as a _ pyrogram _ , in which the x - axis is the pre - determined nucleotide flows and y - axis is the intensity of the emitted light at each nucleotide flow .",
    "excess nucleotides are enzymatically degraded before the next nucleotide is added .",
    "ideally the intensity of the light is proportional to the number of incorporated nucleotides . in reality",
    "this is not always the case due to the nonlinear light response following incorporation of more than a few identical nucleotides .",
    "this poses an inherent difficulty for the pyrosequencing protocol to determine the homopolymeric region accurately .      to avoid the unnecessary specification of the detailed names of the four kinds of nucleotides , in the following we will use @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 to represent any permutations of the usual nucleotides @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . throughout the paper",
    "we assume that the nucleotides in the target sequence are independent of each other .",
    "the probabilities for the four nucleotides in the target sequence are denoted as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . in table",
    "[ t : defs ] we define the nucleotide _ flow cycle number _ @xmath12 ( the third row ) to distinguish it from nucleotide flow number ( the second row ) .",

    "we will use @xmath14 for the length of a sequence .    in table",
    "[ t : defs ] we also show the _ ideal _ pyrograms for two hypothetical sequences with the same length of @xmath15 : ` bddabaaad ` and ` abbbdabbc ` .",
    "although the length of the two sequences is the same , they need different number of flows ( and hence number of cycles ) to determine their sequences , due to the particular arrangements of the nucleotides in the sequences in relation to the order of nucleotide flow : the first sequence needs @xmath16 flows ( @xmath17 cycles ) , while the second sequence needs @xmath18 flows ( @xmath19 cycles ) . in the following we will determine the statistical distributions they will follow .",
    "it is easy to see that at a fixed sequence length @xmath14 , the minimum number of nucleotide flows is @xmath20 for a stretch of @xmath14 @xmath0 s , while the maximum number of nucleotide flows is @xmath21 for sequence ` dcbadcba ... ` .",
