    "permanent superhump systems show superhumps ( quasi - periodicities shifted by a few percent from their orbital periods ) in their optical light curves . the phenomenon is observed during their normal brightness state , unlike in su  uma systems .",
    "permanent superhumps can either be a few percent longer than the orbital periods and are then called ` @xmath0 @xmath1 ' , or shorter than the orbital periods  ` @xmath2 @xmath1 ' .",
    "the positive superhump is explained as the beat between the binary motion and the precession of an accretion disc in the apsidal plane .",
    "similarly , the negative superhump is understood as the beat between the orbital period and the nodal precession of the disc ( patterson 1999 ) .",
    "permanent superhumps have been observed in about 20 cataclysmic variables .",
    "superhumps have been seen in a few lmxrbs in outburst ( e.g. odonoghue & charles 1996 ) , however , there have not been any confirmed detection of permanent superhumps in a lmxrb .",
    "white & swank ( 1982 ) and walter et al .",
    "( 1982 ) independently found 3001-s periodic dips in the x - ray light curve of the lmxrb v1405  aql .",
    "schmidtke ( 1988 ) and grindlay et al .",
    "( 1988 ) reported a detection of an optical periodicity at 3028  s. the difference between the x - ray and optical periods was confirmed by further extensive observations of v1405  aql .",
    "two basic models have been offered so far for the periodicities found in v1405  aql . according to the first model ( grindlay et al .",
    "1988 ) , the longer 3028-s period is the binary inner orbital period , while the shorter 3001-s period is the beat period between the binary period and the @xmath34-d orbital period of a third companion .",
    "the second model ( white 1989 ) suggests that the 3001-s period is the binary period and that the 3028-s period is a positive superhump .",
    "the debate on the nature on v1405  aql has still been continued ( chou , grindlay , & bloser 2001 ; homer et al .",
    "2001 ; haswell et al .",
    "2001 ) . here",
    "we argue that the second model is correct , and present evidence for a third period that we identify as the negative superhump . for more details see retter , chou & bedding ( 2001 ) .",
    "we have re - analysed existing rxte data that were presented by chou et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in fig .",
    "1a the power spectrum of 10 successive runs in 1996 may is presented .",
    "in addition to the two known periods ( 3001 and 3028  s , marked as f@xmath4 and f@xmath5 ) and their 1-d aliases , there is a third peak ( f@xmath6 ) together with its 1-d alias pattern . after fitting and subtracting the two known frequencies ,",
    "the third , which corresponds to the periodicity 2979.3@xmath71.1 s , becomes the strongest peak in the residual power spectrum ( fig .",
    "1b ) . to test the possibility that a combination of the window function and the two known periods is responsible for the third periodicity , we planted sinusoids of the two known periods in the data ( plus noise ) .",
    "the result ( fig .",
    "1c ) did not show any other significant peak in the power spectrum .",
    "we also rejected manually the points corresponding to the dips from the light curve .",
    "the new period was still present in the corresponding power spectrum ( fig .",
    "finally , we divided the data into two parts ( first and last five runs ) , and the new periodicity appeared in both .",
    "the 2979-s period is shorter than the 3001-s period by about 0.7% . assuming that the 3001-s period is the orbital period and that the 3028-s period is a positive superhump , the new period is naturally explained as a negative superhump .",
    "patterson ( 1999 ) proposed that the negative superhump deficit is about half the positive superhump excess .",
    "the corresponding ratio in v1405  aql ( 0.8 ) is somewhat larger than this . in fig .",
    "2 we show this ratio for all systems known to have both positive and negative superhumps , and we see a clear trend as a function of orbital period . our result for v1405",
    "aql fits this trend very well .",
    "our suggestion that the 2979-s period is a negative superhump implies a nodal precession of @xmath34.8 d. indeed chou et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found that the phase jitter of the x - ray dips in the 1996 may data is modulated with a period of 4.86 d. homer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reached a similar conclusion from a different dataset and found a period of 4.74@xmath70.05 d. therefore , the superhump model can explain this periodicity as well .",
    "the classification of v1405  aql as a permanent superhump system is thus firmly established , and our result puts an end to the 13-year debate on the nature of this intriguing system .",
