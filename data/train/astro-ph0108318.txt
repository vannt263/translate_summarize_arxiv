    "an additional option is a cryogenic multi - object spectroscopy with independent integral field units .",
    "although it is certainly a challenging endeavor , it is also the most versatile and sensitive option .",
    "it is this option that we propose here .    as an example of the wide range of science issues that can be addressed with such an instrument , some of the key science drivers are ,    1 .",

    "project [ proj1 ] ) calls for high quality h@xmath7 ( and other emission lines ) profiles in a large number of galaxies of different characteristics , for studying the cosmological evolution of galaxy mass and studying the cosmological evolution of galaxy mass and mass - to - luminosity ratio .",
    "spatially resolved measurements with @xmath8 0.5  resolution ( in good seeing , or with ao ) are necessary to resolve rotation curves in sources that are typically 1  to 2  in diameter . both hierarchical merger scenarios in a cold dark matter universe and current observations at z@xmath91 and z@xmath32.5 indicate that for 1@xmath9z@xmath92 galaxy properties should exhibit rapid evolution , which would be most pronounced for the most massive systems . j / h / k observations are necessary for addressing the h@xmath7 line .",
    "another goal is the investigation of metallicities , stellar populations and star formation histories through emission line ratios , where spatially resolved information is desirable but not in all cases necessary ( or possible ) . in conjunction with recent theoretical models , studies of the dynamics and star formation properties of large samples of high - z galaxies , especially in the critical range between z=1 and z=2.5 ( reachable only or primarily with infrared observations ) , will give a better understanding of the processes involved in galaxy formation / evolution and the formation of the hubble sequence .",

    "project [ proj2 ] ) aims at the important issue of how the most massive galaxies evolve , when and how elliptical galaxies were formed , and whether some ellipticals formed very early ( z@xmath103 ) through major starbursts .",
    "it will require high signal - to - noise ratio spectra to get at key absorption lines ( balmer lines , mg b , g - band , etc . ) for redshift determinations , measurements of velocity dispersions , metallicities and ages .",
    "distant ellipticals and dusty star bursts are often extremely red ( r@xmath11k@xmath35 ) so that only infrared spectroscopy has a chance of getting redshifts and/or information on their physical characteristics .",
    "project [ proj3 ] ) requires determination of emission line redshifts for larger samples of the faint far - infrared / submm sources found by iso , scuba and mambo ( and in the future by sirtf , first / herschel and alma ) and of the hard x - ray sources currently discovered by xmm - newton and chandra . the final objective of this project is an investigation of the relationship and relative cosmological evolution of powerful starbursts and accreting massive black holes .",
    "the goal of project [ proj4 ] ) is an empirical determination of the temporal and spatial evolution of nearby starbursts for a more detailed understanding of global star formation processes ( feedback , superwinds , initial mass function , globular cluster formation , etc . ) .",
    "apart from being a key issue in its own right , this project also serves as input for the high - z studies mentioned above .",

    ", there are typically between a few to a few tens of sources in the 7 unvignetted field of view of the vlt .",

    "line suppression / avoidance for optimization of sensitivity out to 2.4@xmath4 m , 2 .   simultaneous coverage of j- , h- , and k - bands at spectral resolving powers sufficient for high quality dynamical studies and for software oh suppression ( @xmath1/@xmath2@xmath1@xmath104000 ) , 3 .   individual integral field units covering typical object sizes ( @xmath102  ) at pixel scales suitable for spatially resolved studies ( @xmath00.15  to 0.25  ) , and 4 .",

    "for comparison the spectra of a moderately extincted starburst galaxy ( bluer spectrum ) and an elliptical galaxy ( redder spectrum ) are shown , for a redshift of 2.2 and an ab magnitude of 22 @xcite .",
    "note the very substantial improvement between oh suppressing / avoiding nir spectrometers with sub - arcsecond slits ( such as isaac , nirspec and nirmos ) compared to instruments without these features ( even on an 8 m telescope : long - short - short dashed line ) .",
    "nirmos ( long - short dashed bars ) is not cryogenic , however , resulting in non optimum h - band performance ( and no k - band capability ) .",
    "because of its integral field nature , the cromos gains another factor of @xmath02 for compact sources , since the effective ` slit ' can be optimized for the shape of the source and the seeing .",
    "the lower dashed curve gives the performance of the mos in conjunction with a high performance ( 2@xmath4 m strehl ratio 0.7 ) mcao system and 0.2  ( software ) pixels . only the ngst multi - slit mos ( lower long dashes ) outperforms the cromos , especially at @xmath1@xmath102@xmath4 m .",
    "between oh sky lines , the point source performance of the cromos ( in terms of flux density of ab magnitude : ab=@xmath112.5logs@xmath16(jy ) + 8.9 ) is significantly better than that of optical multi object spectrometers , such as fors or vimos .",
    "note , however , that a few percent of the wavelength range covered by the mos are strongly affected by oh sky lines , and thus must be discarded for faint source spectroscopy . ]",
    "the basic layout of the spectrometer and camera derives its design and heritage from that of the spiffi spectrometer for the vlt @xcite .",
    "it consists of pre - optics to re - image the object plane from the ao , an image - slicer to cut the two - dimensional field into a set of slitlets , and a spectrometer with an f/30 collimator and an f/1.4 camera .",
    "another important function of the pre - optics is to suppress the thermal background with the cold stop .",
    "the camera is a refractive optics using commercial glasses .",
    "the key difference with the spiffi design , other than the image slicer , will be the separation of the j- , h- and k - band light in the collimated part of the beam through beam splitters , followed by three independent gratings , cameras and detectors covering these three bands . with three hawaii 2 detectors and @xmath1/@xmath2@xmath1@xmath04000 the entire wavelength range from 1@xmath4 m to 2.4@xmath4 m can be sampled at the nyquist rate .",
    "the alternative of directly dispersing light onto the detectors with a single grating is very difficult due to the challenging camera optics ( f/1 ) , the very wide wavelength range , and due to the fact that the hawaii 2 detectors are non - buttable .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]      we have tackled the well known problem of low coupling efficiency through fibers from the telescope into a spectrograph , especially in a cryogenic environment , by developing the ` integrated flared fiber - microlens ' technology @xcite .",
    "this concept uses the polished , flared tip of a silica fiber as an integrated microlens , thus efficiently coupling light from the telescope pupil into the core of the fiber ( left inset of figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the hexagonal surface cut of the tip allows a contiguous areal coverage as required for the ifus of the mos discussed here ( right side of figure [ fig3 ] ) . while figure [ fig3 ] shows a hexagonal arrangement of a fiber cluster , other configurations ( e.g. reactangular ) are possible and may better match the elongated shapes of distant galaxies . with @xmath015",
    "cm fiber lengths we have achieved throughput of @xmath380% at 2 @xmath4 m from an f/62 input beam to the end of the fiber .",
    "the flared fiber - integrated microlens technology minimizes reflection losses and misalignments in the cryogenic environment .",
    "nevertheless we are presently also investigating the performance of such separate microlens - fiber systems . in the cromos",
    "the lengths of the fibers would have to be @xmath050 cm , thus reducing the transmission to about 85% at the upper part of the k - band , near an absorption feature of silica , but little affecting the performance at @xmath172.4 @xmath4 m .",
    "the primary challenge of our flared fiber development up to now was the small tolerances of the micro - machining / polishing , thus leading to poor production yields of high throughput fibers .",
    "this issue will have to be dealt with in the next phase of the development .",
    "cold fore - optics are required to efficiently couple the light into a given ifu / fiber cluster and reduce the thermal background . for this purpose and for the mechanical movement of the ifus across the field of view",
    ", we are adopting a ` fishermen - around - the - pond ' arrangement of spider arms .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the mechanical arrangement and optical trains of the spider arms containing the fiber clusters , along with their cold fore - optics .",
    "a field lens at the dewar window is required for centering the pupil onto the cold stop wherever the ifu is on the focal plane .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows an example of optical design in the bottom left .",
    "the field lens changes the direction of the light into the right angle to the focal plane , which is spherical .",
    "the spider arms are fastened with magnets at the back of the spherical , soft iron plate ( figure [ fig4 ] bottom right ) .",
    "we have developed a cryogenic robot to place the spider arms anywhere in the field of view .",
    "the robot ( figure [ fig5 ] ) has three degrees of freedom , one full rotation of the entire device and two linear motions along two side of a parallelogram .",
    "the robot is designed to work at ln@xmath5 temperature and should be able to place 20 arms in about 5 to 10 minutes .",
    "we have developed the first version of the drive software and have successfully tested the operation of the device at room temperature .",
    "cold tests will follow in the next few months .",
    "the cromos described above excels in h - band and k - band sensitivity , speed ( or integration time , or multiplex advantage , or sensitivity squared ) , and simultaneous wavelength coverage for detailed studies of faint sources with a spatial extent of 12  . because of its integral field nature , the device is also optimally suited for studying faint point sources .",
    "there are no slit losses and the source is always ` on ' the detector .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] gives an impression of a typical application ( faint galaxy studies in the chandra south area ) , along with a summary of its performance when compared to a long - slit spectrometer ( isaac , nirspec ) and a warm multi - slit mos ( nirmos ) . in terms of overall speed ,",
    "the proposed cromos is 3500 faster than isaac and nirspec and about 60 times faster than nirmos .",
