    "the search for the higgs - boson ( @xmath1 ) at @xmath2 colliders usually focuses on the channel @xmath3 at the @xmath4 pole @xcite .",
    "some years ago , barroso , pulido and romo @xcite pointed out that the channel @xmath0 could be important in higgs searches , if for no other reason than that the range of accessible @xmath5 is larger .",
    "these authors presented numerical results for relatively low higgs masses ( @xmath6 gev ) and a top quark mass @xmath7 of 40 gev .",
    "they concluded the signal was observable and also drew attention to some interesting theoretical aspects of calculation related to gauge invariance with respect to the photon field .",
    "given the prospect of lep 200 in the near term , the discussion of a higher energy @xmath2 collider ( nlc ) and an indication that @xmath8 gev @xcite , it seemed appropriate to revisit this calculation with the intention of extending the range of @xmath5 and the center of mass energy @xmath9 .",
    "accordingly , we have computed the amplitudes for @xmath0 using two nonlinear gauges @xcite for the @xmath10 s .",
    "our motivation for choosing nonlinear gauges was the reduction in the number of diagrams due to the elimination of @xmath10-neutral gauge boson - charged goldstone boson couplings .",
    "we discovered that these gauges have the additional advantage of greatly simplifying the photon field gauge structure of the various classes of diagrams .    in the next section ,",
    "the choice of gauge fixing terms is presented and we outline the strategy of our calculation",
    ". we then present numerical results for a range of @xmath5 and @xmath2 center of mass energies .",
    "the complete analytical expressions for the amplitudes are given in the appendix .",
    "in the standard model , the lowest order corrections to the amplitudes for @xmath0 come from one - loop diagrams containing various combinations of fermions , gauge bosons , goldstone bosons ( @xmath11 ) and ghosts ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "since the born diagrams for this process are proportional to the electron mass @xmath13 , the one - loop corrections actually determine the amplitude in the @xmath14 limit .",
    "for the purposes of this calculation we generally set @xmath15 , although , as discussed below , some care must be exercised when doing so in one of the diagrams .    the precise number of diagrams encountered when computing the one - loop corrections is influenced by the choice of the gauge for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "it has been shown that a carefully chosen nonlinear gauge @xcite can eliminate the mixed @xmath10-@xmath18-@xmath19 vertices , reduce the number of diagrams and simplify the feynman rules .",
    "more recently , a related nonlinear gauge has been introduced which also eliminates the @xmath10-@xmath18-@xmath4 vertices @xcite and thereby further reduces the number of diagrams .    in this paper , we utilize nonlinear @xmath20 gauges specified by gauge fixing terms of the form @xmath21 where , for either choice of nonlinear gauge , @xmath22 for the nonlinear gauges , we choose @xmath23 or @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 denoting the weak mixing angle .",
    "the gauge parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 are all chosen to be unity , which corresponds to nonlinear t hooft - feynman gauges .",
    "we obtain the ghost couplings for a particular nonlinear gauge by examining the revelant gauge fixing terms .",
    "the diagrams encountered in the calculation of the @xmath29 amplitudes fall into three catagories ( illustrated in fig .",
    "1 ) : those with two poles at @xmath30 ; those with a single @xmath17 or @xmath19 pole ; and triangle or box diagrams with gauge bosons and fermions in the loops . apart from a reduction in the number of diagrams to be calculated",
    ", the use of nonlinear gauges has the additional feature that these catagories are _ separately _ gauge invariant with respect to the photon field .",
    "this is not the case in linear gauges , where the replacement of the photon polarization vector @xmath31 by the momentum vector @xmath32 mixes contributions from various catagories to produce the expected zero result .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the separation of the diagrams into gauge invariant subsets can be traced to the simplified ward identity satisfied by the @xmath10-@xmath10-@xmath19 vertex in either nonlinear gauge .",
    "specifically , if @xmath33 denotes the vertex function for an incoming @xmath10 with momentum @xmath34 and polarization @xmath35 , an outgoing @xmath10 of momentum @xmath36 and polarization @xmath37 and a photon of momentum @xmath38 and polarization @xmath39 , the ward identity is @xmath40\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 the simplicity of the righthand side of eq.([ward ] ) means that the replacement of the photon polarization vector @xmath42 by the momentum @xmath38 merely eliminates one or the other of the propagators adjacent to the vertex .",
    "there are no extra contributions which serve to connect one catagory of diagrams to another .",
    "one consequence of the separation mentioned above is that the double pole diagrams illustrated in fig .",
    "1(a ) vanish when the photon is on the mass shell .",
    "there is no need to perform a renormalization , unlike the situation found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the photon mass shell ,",
    "any given double pole diagram makes a contribution of the general form @xmath43 the coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath45 are expressible in terms of the scalar loop integrals @xmath46 and @xmath47 of t hooft and veltman @xcite .",
    "although @xmath48 and @xmath49 depend on the number of dimensions @xmath50 , they satisfy the relation @xmath51 the contributions of the non - vanishing diagrams are listed in table i. these consist of tadpole and bubble diagrams with @xmath10 s , charged goldstone bosons or ghosts in the loops .",
    "notice that for each particle the sum of the one - point and two - point contributions results in the combination eq .",
    "( [ van ] ) .",
    "consequently , the double pole diagrams all vanish .",
    "the single pole diagrams of fig .",
    "1(b ) involve @xmath17 or @xmath19 poles , with the virtual gauge boson of momentum @xmath34 decaying into @xmath52 ( momenta @xmath53 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "our result for the @xmath54 amplitude is gauge invariant , in agreement with ref.@xcite . unlike ref .",
    "@xcite , we also find the @xmath55 amplitude to be gauge invariant . in the nonlinear gauges",
    "there is no need to combine this contribution with box contributions to achieve a gauge invariant result .",

    "1(c ) ) have no gauge boson poles .",
    "they consist of box diagrams where the photon emerges from one of the box vertices together with associated triangle diagrams with the photon being radiated by one of the incoming leptons .",
    "there are two such combinations of boxes and triangles : one with @xmath4 s in the loops and one with @xmath10 s in the loops .",
