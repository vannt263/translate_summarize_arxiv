    "a parametric electron pump is a device that generates a dc current at zero bias potential through cyclic change of system parameters .",
    "the most direct way to create a dc current was originally proposed by thouless @xcite , who considered a system subjected to a traveling wave potential .",
    "this can be realized for example with the help of surface acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to utilize quantum dots . in closed systems operating in the coulomb blockade regime",
    ", integer number of electric charge can be transferred by sequential changes of barriers like a turnstile @xcite , whereas in open systems the electron pumping can be driven by adiabatic shape change in the confining potential or other parameters which affect the interference pattern of the coherent electrons in the device .",
    "after a cycle of the adiabatic shape change we return to the initial configuration , but the wavefunction may have its phase changed from the initial wavefunction .",
    "this is the so - called geometric or berry s phase @xcite .",
    "this additional phase is equivalent to some charges that pass through the quantum dot , namely , pumped charge @xcite . recently , adiabatic charge pumping in open quantum dots has attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "switkes et al .",
    "report an experimental investigation of electron pumping through an open quantum dot under the shape deformation controlled by two ac gate voltages @xcite . for weak",
    "pumping the dc voltage induced by the pumped dc current not only have a sinusoidal dependence on phase difference @xmath1 of the two ac voltages applied to the gates , but is also proportional to the square of the pumping strength @xmath2 .",
    "many aspects of the experimental results can be understood in terms of brouwer s scattering approach @xcite .",
    "the change in the charge of the dot in response to a small variation of external parameter @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the emissivity @xcite .",
    "the pumped charge during each cycle can be determined by integrating @xmath6 along the closed path in the parameter space @xmath7 defined by one pumping cycle .",
    "then , the pumped charge @xmath8 is rewritten as an integral over the surface enclosed by the path by using green s theorem , e.g. in two parameter case @xmath9 . assuming @xmath10 is constant over small area of @xmath11 , for weak pumping one",
    "can show the pumping current @xmath12 , which exactly corresponds to what was observed in the experiment . for strong",
    "pumping , however , the dc voltage generated by the pumped current deviates from the sinusoidal dependence on @xmath1 , and also departs from the @xmath13 dependence .",
    "the non - sinusoidal dependence can be understood by taking into account that @xmath10 is no longer constant over the integration area when @xmath2 is considerably large . in ref .",
    "@xcite the anomalous @xmath2 dependence was ascribed to the occurrence of significant heating and dephasing as a result of strong pumping .",
    "the parametric electron pump is a time dependent system driven by ( at least ) two different time periodic perturbations with the same angular frequency and phase difference @xmath1 .",
    "one can deal with this problem using not only adiabatic approximation exploited by brouwer but also floquet approach @xcite .",
    "an oscillating potential can transfer an incoming electron of energy @xmath14 to floquet side bands at @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is an integer and @xmath17 is the angular frequency of the oscillation .",
    "a scattering matrix for a time dependent system can be constructed from the interplay of these sidebands @xcite .",
    "so far there have been relatively few works on non - adiabatic parametric electron pumps @xcite , and the comparison between the adiabatic and the floquet approach is still missing .",
    "we show , using a simple scattering model with two harmonically oscillating @xmath0-function barriers , that for small @xmath2 these two approaches give exactly equivalent results for the pumped charge while for large @xmath2 they are different . even though the pumped current as a function of @xmath2 obtained from these two approaches shows qualitatively similar behavior , the physical interpretation is completely different .",
    "this discrepancy in large @xmath2 is not fully ascribed to the breakdown of adiabatic conditions since the wigner delay times calculated by using floquet scattering matrix are still much smaller than an oscillation period of external pumping potentials .    in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce our model system and investigate the characteristics of the pumped current using brouwer s scattering approach . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the floquet approach for parametric electron pumps and compare with those of sec .",
    "we also discuss the validity of adiabatic theory by using the wigner delay time .",
    "finally , we conclude our paper in sec .  iv .",
    "as a model system we consider 1d two harmonically oscillating @xmath0-function barriers with the strengthes @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively , separated by a distance @xmath20 . this is a simplified model of the experiment by switkes et al . , but possesses many important characteristics and can be easily handled .",
    "wei et al . studied parametric charge pumping aided by quantum resonance using this model and found that the pumped current has large values near a resonance level @xcite . due to the double barrier geometry",
    ", resonant tunneling also plays an important role in charge pumping .",
    "the @xmath21 scattering matrix of the double barriers with the strengthes @xmath22 and @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the reflection and the transmission amplitudes respectively , for modes incident from the left ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 are similar quantities for modes incident from the right .",
    "the charge emitted per cycle to the right is obtained from @xmath29 where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , and @xmath32 is the period of the pumping .",
    "one can show that the emitted charge to the left @xmath33 is equal to @xmath34 .",
    "equation ( [ brouwer_charge ] ) can be rewritten in the following form by using green s theorem @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the pumped current is easily obtained from @xmath37 .",
    "we use the parameters @xmath38 nm for the distance between the two barriers , the effective mass @xmath39 of an electron in gaas , and @xmath40 ps for the period of pumping , which corresponds to @xmath41 mev .",
    "figure [ pcharge ] shows the pumped current as a function of the energy of an incident electron with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "we present two examples ; the first is a nearly open case ( @xmath45=0 ) in figs .",
    "[ pcharge]a and [ pcharge]b , and the second is a closed case ( @xmath45=225 mev@xmath46 nm ) in figs .",

    "one can directly see the relation between the pumped currents and transmission resonances in figs .",
    "[ pcharge]c and [ pcharge]d , where the transmission poles are denoted by the filled circles ( @xmath47 ) . to find these poles we considered a scattering problem with _ static _",
    "double barriers of strength @xmath45 .",
    "the imaginary part of the pole ( denoted by the length of error bars attached to the filled circles ) is related to the lifetime of a resonant ( or quasibound ) state , and determines the width of the transmission peaks .",
    "peaks of the pumped current and their width are also described by the real and imaginary part of the resonance poles respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ pcharge]c . in fig .",
    "[ pcharge]d , however , the width of the pumped current is larger than the imaginary part of the resonance energy due to the effect of strong oscillation .",
    "moreover , in the open case ( figs .",
    "[ pcharge]a and [ pcharge]b ) , this analysis is no more relevant since there is no resonance in the static double barrier model .",
    "figure [ saturation ] shows the pumped current as a function of the pumping strength @xmath2 for @xmath48 ( the open case ) with @xmath44 . here for small @xmath2 the pumped current depends on @xmath13 and has an exact sinusoidal dependence on @xmath1 , while for larger @xmath2 the pumped current saturates and even decreases as @xmath2 increases , and also deviates from the sinusoidal dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "the decrease of the pumped current can be understood by considering the charge flux @xmath49 in fig .",

    "the integration area only contains the positive @xmath10 s ( the solid circle ) .",

    "[ flux ] ) the integration area begins to include the region with both the positive and the negative @xmath10 s , which means @xmath50 no longer increases as @xmath2 increases .",
    "this explains why the pumped current saturates and even decreases above @xmath52 mev@xmath46 nm as shown in fig .",
    "[ saturation ] . from this",
    "we expect that the behavior of the saturation of the pumped current would depend on @xmath1 since the shape of the integration area is determined by @xmath1 . for example , with @xmath53 the integration area denoted by the dashed dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ flux ] is distorted from the original circular shape , so that even for @xmath54 mev@xmath46 nm the integration area contains only positive @xmath10 s .",
    "figure [ saturation ] clearly shows the pumped current with @xmath53 saturates much more slowly in comparison with the pumped current with @xmath44 .",
    "the non - sinusoidal dependence of the pumped current on @xmath1 for large @xmath2 is also ascribed to the loss of circular symmetry of @xmath10 in @xmath11 .",

    "brouwer s approach is based upon the adiabatic approximation , which implies that any time scale of the problem considered , especially the electron dwell time in a quantum dot ( or inside double barriers in our case ) , must be much smaller than the period of the oscillation of a external pumping @xmath104 @xcite . using the floquet formalism",

    "the wigner delay times become smaller for both larger @xmath14 and lower @xmath45 , which can be understood when we take into account that usually the electron dwell time is short if the energy of an incident electron is large or the scattering barrier is weak .",
    "the wigner delay times have larger values near the resonances , which is ascribed to the fact that at the resonances an electron can stay in the quantum dot for a long time . near the resonances the adiabatic condition can break down .",
