    "supernova neutrinos offer unique insights into both the fundamental nature of neutrinos and the complex process of core collapse .",
    "although theoretical calculations predict that a typical supernova releases approximately @xmath2 ergs of gravitational binding energy , @xmath3 of which is carried away by neutrinos , the only supernova neutrinos ever detected came from a single supernova , sn 1987a  @xcite .",
    "many open questions in supernova core - collapse models could be resolved with additional supernova neutrino data , motivating large neutrino detectors to search their datasets for multiple events clustered closely in time , which could be considered candidate supernova neutrino events .",
    "one such neutrino detector , the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno )  @xcite , was an imaging water cherenkov detector located at a depth of 5890  m of water equivalent in the vale inco .",
    "creighton mine near sudbury , ontario , canada .",
    "sno detected neutrinos using an ultra - pure heavy water ( @xmath4h@xmath5o , hereafter d@xmath5o ) target contained in a transparent spherical acrylic vessel 12  m in diameter .",
    "neutrino interactions in the vessel produced cherenkov light that was detected by an array of 9456 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) supported by a stainless steel geodesic structure .",
    "outside the geodesic structure were 5700 tonnes of light water that were monitored by outward - facing pmts in order to identify cosmic - ray muons .",
    "the d@xmath5o target allowed sno to detect neutrino events via three different reactions :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the first reaction can provide a triple coincidence between the two neutrons and the positron , but it has a relatively small cross section .",
    "the second reaction has a much higher cross section but occured only in sno s 1700 tonne light water shield , which was between the acrylic vessel and the pmt support structure . for this analysis",
    "we have focused only on the d@xmath5o region .",
    "additional reactions on oxygen isotopes are also possible , but the rarity of @xmath6o and @xmath7o in both the h@xmath5o and d@xmath5o volumes made the event rates from these processes very low .",
    "sno s sensitivity to all neutrino flavors and the comparison of the rates of the different possible reactions provide exciting opportunities to distinguish various supernova models and investigate neutrino properties  @xcite . during sno",
    "s run time , it participated in the supernova early warning system ( snews ) , which was designed to notify the astronomical community within minutes of the detection of a large neutrino burst  @xcite . in order to avoid triggering on a false burst during this real time analysis ,",
    "the threshold for the number of events qualifying as a burst was conservatively set to be 30 events in less than 2  s. although sno did not observe such a large burst during its run time , a more thorough search is required to determine whether or not sno observed any evidence of a supernova .    in this paper",
    "we have searched the sno dataset for low - multiplicity bursts , which we define as bursts of two or more events .",
    "such bursts could come from supernovae in satellites of the milky way that are hidden by interstellar dust , from non - standard supernovae in our own galaxy with relatively low neutrino fluxes , or from completely unknown and unexpected sources of neutrinos .",
    "the super - kamiokande collaboration has recently published a similar search  @xcite .",
    "our search is complementary to that of super - kamiokande , in that for much of the running period examined here the super - kamiokande detector was not operational .",
    "additionally sno was primarily sensitive to electron neutrinos , while super - kamiokande was primarily sensitive to electron antineutrinos .",
    "the data analyzed here include two phases of sno s operation .",
    "phase  i ran from november 1999 to may 2001 , and the sensitive volume of the detector was filled only with d@xmath5o .",
    "phase  ii ran from july 2001 to august 2003 , and during this phase nacl was added to the detector , increasing the sensitivity to the nc reaction through the consequent enhancement of neutron detection efficiency .",
    "phase  ii began running shortly after super - kamiokande s first phase of data taking ended , meaning that the majority of sno phase  ii contains no overlap with the supernova search performed by super - kamiokande .",
    "because of the enhanced nc detection efficiency , sno phase  ii provides a higher sensitivity to a potential supernova signal .",
    "the total livetime of phase  i was 241.4 days , while the total livetime of phase  ii was 388.4 days .",
    "the absolute time of an event was measured by a gps system whose accuracy was @xmath8  ns  @xcite .",
    "we estimated all of the backgrounds that could mimic a supernova burst signal , and we designed our search windows and analysis cuts to ensure that we were @xmath0 confident we would not see a false burst .",
    "we optimized our searches by adjusting the minimum burst multiplicity , the length of the coincidence time interval , and the energy threshold for individual events .",
    "our energy threshold sets a lower limit on the reconstructed total energy of the detected electrons , which may have significantly lower energies than the neutrinos themselves .",
    "sensitivity to a supernova signal is increased by selecting a long coincidence time interval , a low multiplicity requirement , and a low energy threshold , but these criteria must be balanced against the increase in the probability of a `` background '' burst , especially through accidental coincidences .",
    "as the energy threshold is lowered , the event rate goes up , and hence the accidental coincidence rate increases , particularly for low - multiplicity bursts and for a long coincidence time interval . to ensure a 90@xmath9 probability of seeing no false bursts within a given search window",
    ", the expected backgrounds from all sources must sum to no more than 0.11 events .",
    "our optimization ultimately led us to perform three distinct searches : two multiplicity two ( @xmath10 ) searches , and one multiplicity three ( @xmath11 ) search .",
    "the first of our @xmath10 searches used a short window ( 0.05  s ) to focus on detecting neutrinos from a supernova neutronization burst . in the case of a failed supernova",
    ", the neutronization burst provides the only potential signal because shortly after the neutronization phase , the supernova collapses into a black hole , abruptly terminating the neutrino signal  @xcite .",
    "these unusual supernovae are of special interest to astronomers , and their neutrino signatures could provide interesting model constraints .",
    "the second multiplicity two window was of moderate length ( 0.2  s for phase  i and 1  s for phase  ii ) to maximize our sensitivity to a standard supernova event .",
    "table  [ tbl : windows ] summarizes the search windows and their respective energy thresholds .",
    "ccc    phase  i , n@xmath12 & 0.05 & 5.0 + phase  i , n@xmath12 & 0.2 & 6.0 + phase  i , n@xmath13 & 10.0 & 4.5 + phase  ii , n@xmath12 & 0.05 & 6.5 + phase  ii , n@xmath12 & 1.0 & 8.5 + phase  ii , n@xmath13 & 10.0 & 4.5 +    the phase  i data set entirely overlaps with the running of super - kamiokande , while much of phase  ii does not overlap .",
    "consequently for phase  i our optimization was intended to maintain some neutral current sensitivity , which super - kamiokande does not have to great extent , with the aim of being able to detect non - standard burst sources . for phase  ii , however , our goal was to maximize overall supernova sensitivity , and therefore we used a fairly large ( 1  s ) search window .",
    "the 1  s window required us to raise the energy threshold high enough that there is very little remaining neutral current signal , but it increased our overall sensitivity to standard supernovae bursts .    for the multiplicity three search , where accidentals are not a major background ,",
    "the window for each phase is 10  s , and the energy threshold is 4.5 mev . primarily because of the low energy threshold available for this search",
    ", it provides the best sensitivity to standard supernovae bursts .    in order to simulate a `` standard '' supernova burst",
    ", we utilized supernova monte carlo simulations based on the burrows model  @xcite .",
    "the average neutrino energies from this model are @xmath14  mev , @xmath15  mev , and @xmath16  mev , where @xmath17 represents any of the flavors @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , or @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the primary difficulty in performing a triggerless burst search is the elimination of the `` background '' created by false bursts . in addition to the accidental coincidences ,",
    "a large number of correlated physics backgrounds must be estimated and almost entirely eliminated .",
    "sno s sensitivity to neutrons makes this problem particularly difficult : any process that produces multiple neutrons can lead to an apparent burst , with the average time between neutron captures being roughly 50  ms in phase  i due to capture on deuterium and 5  ms in phase  ii due to capture on cl .",
    "table  [ tbl : bkgd ] shows our background estimates for each of our search windows before we apply any special analysis cuts designed to remove false bursts beyond the standard sno analysis cuts  @xcite .",
    "most of the multiplicity three backgrounds are conservatively assumed to have upper limits corresponding to the multiplicity two estimates .",
    "the dominant correlated backgrounds are interactions by atmospheric neutrinos , which can produce neutrons without any primary large energy deposit to tag the events . for both phase",
    "i and phase  ii , the atmospheric background was estimated with the neutrino interaction generator nuance  @xcite , whose output was then further processed by the full sno detector simulation .",
    "the simulation s atmospheric neutrino energies ranged from 100  mev to 2  tev , and flavor oscillation corrections were applied .",
    "the systematic error in the nuance simulation is conservatively estimated to be @xmath2220@xmath9 , and it is dominated by uncertainties in the neutrino cross sections .",
    "most muons traveling through the sno detector were tagged by outward - looking pmts , and neutrons following these muons are eliminated by a 20  s software ` muon follower ' veto .",
    "some muons , however , do not have enough energy to trigger the outward - looking pmts and will leak into the detector .",
    "fortunately few of these muons are likely to produce multiple neutrons that could mimic a burst . in the entire livetime of phase  ii ,",
    "the effect of the remaining leaked muons is estimated to cause fewer than 1.35 single - neutron events , implying a conservative upper limit of fewer than 0.5 coincidence events for phase  ii .",
    "since phase  i would have even fewer coincidences , the same conservative upper limit of 0.5 coincidences is assumed .",
    "although the sno detector was constructed from materials with low radioactivity , some radioactive backgrounds still existed , such as @xmath23u , and spontaneous fission from residual radioactivity can lead to false bursts due to multiple neutron capture .",
    "many of the radioactive backgrounds discussed in previous sno analyses are not significant in this search because they will not produce bursts of events , but fission neutrons from @xmath23u can create a background burst .",
    "the amount of @xmath23u in the detector was measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer in september 2003 after the addition of nacl to the heavy water  @xcite .",
    "more @xmath23u could have been present in phase  ii than in phase  i because the addition of nacl prevented the use of sno s reverse osmosis purification system ; therefore , this @xmath23u measurement was used as an upper limit for phase  i. using the standard probability of a fission producing various neutron multiplicities  @xcite , we estimated a very conservative upper limit of 0.79 ( 10 ) fission bursts due to @xmath23u for phase  i ( phase  ii ) .",
    "this limit also assumed a 65@xmath9 detection efficiency for neutrons above 4.5  mev and a 40@xmath9 efficiency for detecting a gamma burst in coincidence with the fission .    a very small fraction of the time",
    ", the production of even a single neutron via the nc reaction can lead to an apparent burst .",
    "if a @xmath24 ray from the capture on deuterium ( in phase  i ) or chlorine ( phase  ii ) produces an electron above threshold via compton scattering and then subsequently photodisintegrates a deuteron , it can create a second neutron .",
    "based on the sno monte carlo simulation , this photodisintegration background has been estimated to cause a small background of less than 0.01 coincidences in phase  i and @xmath25 coincidences in phase  ii .",
    "antineutrinos can also lead to apparent bursts , due to the primary positron created in the interaction and the following capture of one or two neutrons .",
    "antineutrinos from radioactive nuclei in the earth surrounding the detector lead to a negligible background from this process for phase  i and @xmath26 bursts for phase  ii .",
    "a study of all commercial nuclear reactors within 500  km of sno determined that the coincidence background from antineutrinos from these reactors was also very small , @xmath27 coincidences for phase  i and @xmath28 for phase  ii .    during the sno detector construction",
    "the acrylic was exposed to air containing radon . in the decay chain of radon",
    "is @xmath29po , which can decay via @xmath30-emission .",
    "the @xmath30 can interact with the carbon in the acrylic , leading to @xmath31c@xmath32o reactions in which the @xmath33o will produce a @xmath34 pair or a @xmath24-ray that can photodisintegrate deuterium .",
    "the estimates of @xmath35 coincidences from monte carlo studies of this background are low .",
    "coincidences due to the diffuse supernova background ( dsnb ) and to instrumental background events are also estimated to be quite low , as shown in table  [ tbl : bkgd ] .",

    "as in previous analyses , we utilized a fiducial volume radius of 550  cm , as well as a variety of instrumental cuts based on pmt charge and timing information .",
    "our high level cuts incorporated information such as the isotropy of the detected light and the event s reconstruction quality , but we did not include any of the cuts sno previously designed to remove bursts from the data set .",
    "instead we designed new cuts that could discriminate between background bursts and potential supernova bursts .",
    "false bursts from atmospheric reactions often have a high - energy primary , followed by delayed neutron captures .",
    "we removed these bursts by imposing a deadtime window following any event whose energy exceeded roughly 80  mev . the 80  mev threshold",
    "was chosen to minimize the acceptance loss for neutrinos from a standard supernova , whose energies tend to peak near 20  mev .",
    "for phase  i , in which the neutron capture time is @xmath59  ms , we used a deadtime window of @xmath60  ms , and for phase  ii , in which the capture time is @xmath61  ms , we used a deadtime window of 200  ms .",
    "when we applied this cut to our monte carlo simulation of a standard supernova , no genuine supernova bursts were removed .",
    "in addition to having large energies , the primaries from an atmospheric neutrino interaction often have multiple tracks or are heavier particles than the electrons expected either from charged current supernova interactions or from the compton scattering of @xmath24 rays released in neutron capture .",
    "we removed false bursts associated with these events by tagging any event that was not electron - like , and removing all events within 600  ms ( phase  i ) and 200  ms ( phase  ii ) afterward . our definition of an electron - like event was based on the pmt hit pattern and kolgmogorov - smirnov tests on the angular distribution of cherenkov light of reconstructed events , as has been done in other sno analyses  @xcite .",
    "we estimated the acceptance of this cut by applying it to our monte carlo simulation of supernova bursts , and we found that for both phases of the experiment , only @xmath62 of genuine supernova bursts were removed .",
    "the same cut applied to simulated atmospheric neutrino events removed @xmath63 of those bursts that pass the standard analysis cuts from phase  i and @xmath64 from phase  ii .    with the exception of accidental coincidences , almost all sources of false bursts",
    "are spatially correlated .",
    "neutrons from atmospheric interactions or fission will capture near the primary event and near one another . to remove events on this basis",
    ", we use a cut developed by the super - kamiokande collaboration in their triggerless burst analysis  @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath65r as a weighted mean of the distances between the reconstructed event positions in a candidate burst : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the distance between the reconstructed positions of events @xmath68 and @xmath69 within a burst , @xmath70 is the multiplicity of the burst , and @xmath71 is the number of non - redundant combinations . for sno , we can improve on the straightforward @xmath65r cut by using the fact that most spatially correlated events are due to neutron captures , and therefore there is a direct relationship between @xmath65r of the events and the time that separates them , due to the neutron diffusion time within the heavy water .",
