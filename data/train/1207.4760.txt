    "since the rate of both collisional and rotational decoherence is negligible on the experimentally realized time scale of a few picoseconds , and the target population is small , the signal magnitude is proportional to the population of the final state .",

    "[ figz - intensityscan ] illustrates the main motivation of this work : the efficiency of the raman excitation driven by high - intensity transform - limited pulses saturates , setting an upper bound on the magnitude of the cars signal .",
    "the saturation stems from an oscillatory behavior of the individual target populations , which takes over the linear ( with @xmath51 ) growth of population anticipated in the weak - field limit .",
    "we associate these population oscillations with an interplay of population transfer with multiple ac stark shifts which dynamically change the instantaneous spectrum of the molecular states dressed by the strong laser field .",
    "we note that on the scale of laser intensities considered in this work , the oscillation amplitudes are typically of the order of 1 - 2% of the total population , which explains the low total efficiency of the raman excitation plotted in fig .",
    "[ figz - intensityscan ] .",
    "if the two - photon field is resonant with a raman transition to a certain vibrational state @xmath34 , then the linear frequency chirping of pump and stokes pulses provides the largest suppression of the strong - field saturation ( dashed curve in fig .",

    "raman excitation by a train of pump / stokes pulse pairs ( sinusoidal spectral mask ) showed an intermediate level of saturation ( dotted curve in fig .",

    "this agrees with the perturbative , rather than adiabatic , description of the raman process . as discussed earlier in the text , opposite - sign chirping of pump and stokes pulses results in a lower two - photon intensity which is not sufficient for initiating ap .    in order to test the non - perturbative regime necessary for ap , we shift the central excitation wavelengths to @xmath68 nm and @xmath66 nm",

    "in the first approach , pulse shaping was used to suppress strong - field effects , such as ac stark shifts , while preserving the amplitude of the two - photon field at the frequency of raman resonances .",
