    "approximately half of the heavy elements with mass number @xmath12 and all of the actinides in the solar system are believed to be produced in the @xmath1-process .",
    "the fundamental @xmath1-process theory of burbidge et al .",
    "( 1957 ) and cameron ( 1957 ) successfully explains the gross features of the solar @xmath1-process abundance distribution , such as the existence of abundance peaks at @xmath13 , 130 , and 195 . on the other hand ,",
    "it remains to be established where the @xmath1-process occurs and especially how many different kinds of @xmath1-process events contributed to the solar @xmath1-process abundances .",
    "major advances have been made in calculating @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis in supernovae ( see e.g. , woosley et al . 1994 ) and in using a wide range of model parameters to obtain yields that approximate the solar @xmath1-process abundances ( see e.g. , kratz et al .",
    "there has been a tendency to ascribe all the @xmath1-process nuclei to a single kind of @xmath1-process events ( but see goriely & arnould 1996 ) .",
    "however , most astrophysical models have difficulty in producing all the @xmath1-process abundance peaks from a single source , and the parametric studies certainly do not point to a single kind of @xmath1-process events .    with the recent progress in both observation and theory ,",
    "there is a growing consensus that type ii supernovae are the most probable @xmath1-process site .",
    "the detection of @xmath1-process elements in the extremely metal - poor halo star cs 22892 - 052 by sneden et al .",
    "( 1996 ) argues that the @xmath1-process is primary , already operating in the early history of the galaxy .",
    "studies of galactic chemical evolution ( mathews , bazan , & cowan 1992 ) show that the enrichment of the @xmath1-process elements in the galaxy is consistent with low mass type ii supernovae being the @xmath1-process site .",
    "furthermore , it has been proposed that the @xmath1-process occurs in the neutrino - heated ejecta from the hot protoneutron star produced in a type ii supernova ( woosley & baron 1992 ; woosley & hoffman 1992 ; meyer et al . 1992 ; woosley et al .",
    "while this so - called `` hot bubble '' @xmath1-process model has some deficiencies , especially the need for very high entropies that might be hard to obtain ( witti , janka , & takahashi 1994 ; takahashi , janka , & witti 1994 ; qian & woosley 1996 ; hoffman , woosley , & qian 1997 ) , it also has several attractive features .",
    "for example , the amount of ejecta from the hot bubble is consistent with the expected amount of @xmath1-process material from each supernova ( woosley et al .",
    "1994 ) , and unlike the entropy , can be understood quite well in terms of a simple neutrino - driven wind model ( qian & woosley 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that the intense neutrino flux in this kind of @xmath1-process model can have important effects on the nucleosynthesis ( meyer 1995 ; fuller & meyer 1995 ; mclaughlin & fuller 1996 ; qian et al .",
    "1997 ; haxton et al .",
    "1997 ; mclaughlin & fuller 1997 ) .",
    "in particular , the typical neutrino fluences through the ejecta may lead to identifiable signatures in the @xmath1-process abundance pattern , thus providing a way to reveal the conditions at the @xmath1-process site ( qian et al .",
    "1997 ; haxton et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "regardless of the astrophysical site , two things are needed for an @xmath1-process to work : the neutrons and the seed nuclei to capture them .",
    "in fact , the potential of an astrophysical environment to be the @xmath1-process site can be gauged by a crucial quantity , the neutron - to - seed ratio .",
    "if one always starts from more or less the same seed nuclei , different neutron - to - seed ratios are required to produce the entire solar @xmath1-process nuclear abundance distribution .",
    "one can then ask whether different @xmath1-process nuclei are made in completely different astrophysical environments ( e.g. , type ii supernovae vs. neutron star coalescence ) or in similar environments but just with different neutron - to - seed ratios . because the @xmath1-process abundance distribution in cs 22892 - 052 agrees with that in the solar system quite well ( sneden et al .",
    "1996 ) , and the solar @xmath1-process abundance distribution does not have sudden jumps as a function of the mass number @xmath14 , it may be more natural to expect that all @xmath1-process nuclei come from similar environments ( e.g. , the hot bubble regions in type ii supernovae ) .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the production of @xmath1-process nuclei in a specific environment with a certain distribution of neutron - to - seed ratios as an @xmath1-process `` event . ''",
    "the simplest scenario would be that all @xmath1-process nuclei are produced in a unique kind of @xmath1-process events with a generic abundance pattern . in that case",
    ", the solar @xmath1-process abundance distribution merely reflects the distribution of neutron - to - seed ratios characteristic of these unique @xmath1-process events .    however , wasserburg , busso , & gallino ( 1996 ) pointed out that the above minimal approach to account for the solar @xmath1-process abundance distribution is not consistent with the meteoritic abundance ratios @xmath5i/@xmath15i and @xmath6hf/@xmath16hf in the early solar system .",
    "these authors showed that the @xmath1-process events contributing to @xmath6hf were fully consistent with the uniform production of @xmath17th , @xmath18u , @xmath19u , and @xmath20pu up until the time when the solar system was formed .",
    "however , such a rather uniform production would grossly overproduce @xmath5i ( by a factor of @xmath21 ) and @xmath22pd ( by a factor of @xmath23 ) .",
    "consequently , they argued that there should be diverse sources for the @xmath1-process , one of which produced the @xmath1-process nuclei above @xmath24 and another producing those at lower @xmath14 with a smaller frequency .    in order to account for the solar @xmath1-process abundance distribution and to accommodate the meteoritic data on @xmath5i and @xmath6hf at the same time",
    ", we consider in this paper a minimal scenario where two kinds of @xmath1-process events contribute to the solar @xmath1-process abundances near and above @xmath3 .",
    "using simplified treatment of the @xmath1-process and taking into account other constraints , we show that the main features of the solar @xmath1-process abundance distribution from the peak at @xmath3 , through the peak at @xmath4 , and up to the region of the actinides can be reproduced by a reasonable superposition of these two kinds of @xmath1-process events . in  2 , we describe the hot bubble @xmath1-process model and our simplified @xmath1-process calculation in the context of this model .",
    "we also discuss the constraints on our @xmath1-process calculations from the observed solar @xmath1-process abundance distribution , the meteoritic data on @xmath5i and @xmath6hf , and considerations of various neutrino effects . in  3 , we present our results , and in  4 we discuss their implications for the nature and frequencies of the supernovae associated with these two kinds of @xmath1-process events .",
    "in the following discussion we make the general assumption that the @xmath1-process occurs in the neutrino - heated supernova ejecta ( or neutrino - driven winds ) from the hot protoneutron star , as in the hot bubble @xmath1-process model . in this model",
    ", a neutron - rich mass element expands due to the heating by neutrinos emitted from the protoneutron star . the mass element initially is composed of free nucleons . as it moves away from the protoneutron star into regions of lower temperature and density , it first experiences an @xmath25-particle freeze - out , in which essentially all the protons are consumed , followed by an @xmath25-process ( woosley & hoffman 1992 ) , in which seed nuclei near @xmath26 are produced .",
    "the @xmath1-process then takes place through the capture of the excess neutrons on these seed nuclei .    during the dynamic phase of the @xmath1-process , a set of progenitor nuclei",
    "are populated along the @xmath1-process path through neutron capture , photodisintegration , and charge - changing reactions . in the presence of an intense neutrino flux as in the hot bubble ,",
    "the charge - changing reactions include @xmath0 capture in addition to the usual @xmath2-decay . due to",
    "the high temperature and the high neutron number density at the hot bubble @xmath1-process site , the neutron capture and photodisintegration reactions occur much faster than the charge - changing weak reactions .",
    "consequently , within a given isotopic chain of charge @xmath27 , the relative abundances of the progenitor nuclei on the @xmath1-process path are determined by the statistical @xmath28 equilibrium ( see e.g. , kratz et al .",
    "the relative progenitor abundances corresponding to isotopic chains at different @xmath27 are governed by the charge - changing weak reactions .",
    "when the neutron number density drops below a critical level , the rapid neutron capture stops and the progenitor abundance pattern freezes out . the final @xmath1-process abundance distribution is subsequently reached through a series of charge - changing weak reactions that typically conserve the nuclear mass number @xmath14 .",
    "however , @xmath2-delayed and neutrino - induced neutron emission changes @xmath14 and must be included in the transformation from the neutron - rich progenitor nuclei to the observed stable @xmath1-process nuclei .",
    "various extensive @xmath1-process network calculations exist in the literature ( see e.g. , meyer et al .",
    "1992 ; kratz et al .",
    "however , the underlying key physics in such network calculations can be elucidated with much more modest efforts . in this paper",
    "we adopt the following simplified @xmath1-process calculation .",
    "we start with only neutrons and seed nuclei , and further assume that all seed nuclei have charge @xmath29 and mass number @xmath30 typically found for the products of the @xmath25-process ( hoffman et al .",
    "we then choose an @xmath1-process path .",
    "under the assumption of @xmath28 equilibrium , the @xmath1-process path approximately follows the contour of a constant neutron binding energy specified by the temperature and the neutron number density ( kratz et al . 1993 ) . in general , this path shifts during the @xmath1-process as both the temperature and the neutron number density decrease with time . rather than relying on the assumption of @xmath28 equilibrium and keeping track of the change in the @xmath1-process path , we choose an average nucleus with mass number @xmath31 to represent the progenitor nuclei in the isotopic chain of charge @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , the typical @xmath1-process path , especially the part at the magic neutron numbers , does not rely on the particular assumption of @xmath28 equilibrium .",
    "we note that for a relatively low neutron number density of @xmath32@xmath33 @xmath34 , the @xmath1-process path goes through a number of common progenitor nuclei at the magic neutron numbers even if the temperature is not high enough to establish an @xmath28 equilibrium ( cameron et al . 1983 ) .",
    "thus , for simplicity , we assume in this paper that there is a fixed @xmath1-process path with a unique relation between the progenitor charge @xmath27 and the corresponding mass number @xmath31",
    ". it will become clear later that this relation is used only when we evaluate the neutron - to - seed ratio corresponding to a specific abundance pattern for the progenitor nuclei at freeze - out .    at the magic neutron number @xmath35 , the average nuclei on the @xmath1-process path have charges @xmath3649 , corresponding to @xmath37131 .",
    "those at the magic neutron number @xmath38 have charges @xmath3969 , corresponding to @xmath40195 .",
    "we use a simple linear interpolation to give @xmath31 for the average nuclei with non - magic neutron numbers at @xmath4144 and 5064 . because the solar @xmath1-process abundances at @xmath42 ( e.g. , the actinides ) are very small",
    ", we assume that all the abundances for @xmath43 are concentrated in an average nucleus with @xmath44 as explained later .",
    "the chosen @xmath1-process path is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "( the progenitor nuclei with magic neutron number @xmath45 are not included in our simplified calculation , because our assumed seed nuclei have neutron number @xmath46 . in the hot bubble @xmath1-process model the @xmath45 progenitor nuclei",
    "are produced in the @xmath25-process .",
    "consequently , the solar @xmath1-process abundance peak at @xmath13 usually attributed to these progenitor nuclei will not be discussed in this paper , which focuses on the @xmath1-process nuclei near and above @xmath3 . )    finally , we specify the @xmath2-decay rates for these average nuclei on the @xmath1-process path . for the nuclei at the @xmath35 and 126 closed neutron shells , we take the @xmath2-decay rates from table 4 in fuller & meyer ( 1995 ) and the tabulation by mller et al . ( 1996 )",
    ". the average @xmath2-decay rates are @xmath47 and 16 s@xmath48 for the progenitor nuclei with @xmath35 and 126 , respectively .",
    "although several nuclei near @xmath35 and @xmath49 have experimentally measured @xmath2-decay half - lives , the @xmath2-decay properties for the majority of the progenitor nuclei have to be calculated by theory , and therefore are subject to considerable uncertainties . for our simplified @xmath1-process calculation",
    ", we take an approximate @xmath2-decay rate @xmath50 s@xmath48 for all the average nuclei with non - magic neutron numbers ( i.e. , those with @xmath5144 and 5064 ) .",
    "this rate is reasonable for the progenitor nuclei with non - magic neutron numbers on a typical @xmath1-process path whether @xmath28 equilibrium is assumed or not .",
    "in fact , our conclusions do not depend sensitively on the particular choice of this rate as long as it is much larger than the @xmath2-decay rates for the progenitor nuclei with magic neutron numbers .    as mentioned previously , the intense neutrino flux in the hot bubble",
    "necessitates the inclusion of @xmath0 capture as an important type of charge - changing reactions during the supernova @xmath1-process .",
    "furthermore , we must include @xmath0 capture in our @xmath1-process calculation in order to consistently study various effects of this intense neutrino flux on the @xmath1-process .",
    "the @xmath0 capture rates in an expanding mass element depend on the @xmath0 flux , and hence on the @xmath0 luminosity @xmath52 and the radius @xmath1 of the mass element . assuming that the @xmath0 luminosity evolves with time @xmath53 as @xmath54 , and that the mass element expands with a constant dynamic timescale @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath56 , we can write the rate for @xmath0 capture on an average nucleus with charge @xmath27 as @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 stand for @xmath52 in unit of @xmath60 erg s@xmath48 and @xmath1 in unit of @xmath61 cm , respectively , and @xmath62 in equation ( 1 ) , @xmath63 is the time at which the @xmath1-process begins in the mass element expanding away from the protoneutron star , and @xmath64 is the @xmath0 capture rate for @xmath65 erg s@xmath48 and @xmath66 cm .",
    "we follow the calculations of qian et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and take @xmath67 , 5.7 , 7.0 , and 8.5 s@xmath48 for @xmath5144 , 4549 , 5064 , and 6569 , respectively .    from our previous discussion of this supernova @xmath1-process model , it follows that the abundances of progenitor nuclei on the @xmath1-process path are determined by @xmath68y(z_s , t),\\ ] ] and @xmath69y(z-1,t ) -[\\lambda_\\beta(z)+\\lambda_{\\nu_e}(z , t)]y(z , t)\\ ] ] for @xmath70 .",
    "clearly , the total abundance of all progenitor nuclei satisfy @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the total number of seed nuclei at the beginning of the @xmath1-process .",
    "we can define an average mass number @xmath73 for these progenitor nuclei through @xmath74 from mass conservation , we have @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the neutron abundance . when @xmath77 becomes negligible at @xmath78 , the rapid neutron capture stops , and the progenitor abundance pattern freezes out .",
    "the condition for freeze - out then reads @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the neutron - to - seed ratio .    from a set of parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , our simplified @xmath1-process calculation described above",
    "can be carried out in a straightforward manner .",
    "the progenitor abundance pattern at freeze - out is obtained by integrating equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) until equation ( 8) is satisfied .",
    "however , the motivation of this paper is to explore the diversity of supernova @xmath1-process .",
    "therefore , instead of adopting parameters from some specific supernova model , we treat @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 as free parameters .",
    "our goal is then to find the parameters that can lead to the specific freeze - out progenitor abundance patterns discussed in the next subsection .      by employing extensive network calculations in their @xmath1-process studies ,",
    "previous workers have obtained detailed freeze - out abundance patterns for the progenitor nuclei and followed the subsequent @xmath2-decay to stability after freeze - out .",
    "thus they can compare their final @xmath1-process abundance distributions with the observed solar @xmath1-process abundance data on a nucleus - by - nucleus basis in order to derive the varying physical conditions ( e.g. , neutron number density , temperature , and @xmath1-process timescale ) at the @xmath1-process site(s ) ( kratz et al .",
    "1993 ) or to demonstrate the virtues of an astrophysical model for the @xmath1-process ( woosley et al .",
    "1994 ) . with our simplified @xmath1-process calculation , we are not able to make such a detailed comparison . instead , we try to relate the essential features of the observed solar @xmath1-process abundance distribution to the freeze - out progenitor abundance patterns in our calculation .",
    "first of all , we only consider the @xmath1-process nuclei with @xmath84 , and divide the solar @xmath1-process abundance distribution into four regions : ( i ) the @xmath3 peak ( @xmath85130 ) , ( ii ) @xmath86190 , ( iii ) the @xmath4 peak ( @xmath87195 ) , and ( iv ) @xmath43 ( cf .",
    "1 ) . using the solar @xmath1-process abundance data deduced by kppeler , beer , & wisshak ( 1989 ) , we find that the sum of abundances in each of the first three regions satisfies @xmath88 the sum of abundances for @xmath89209 is slightly less than that for region iii .",
    "allowing for the depletion of the actinides ( @xmath42 ) through fission , we assume @xmath90 in general , the solar @xmath1-process abundances result from a superposition of different kinds of @xmath1-process events . since the sum of abundances in each region is not affected very much by either @xmath2-delayed or neutrino - induced neutron emission , we take , for example , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a weighting parameter , and @xmath93 is the sum of the progenitor abundances in region i at freeze - out in the @xmath94th kind of @xmath1-process events . as only the sum of abundances in region",
    "iv is of interest , we just need to calculate @xmath95 for @xmath96 in each kind of @xmath1-process events , and then obtain @xmath97 , and hence @xmath98 , from equation ( 5 ) . using the solar @xmath1-process abundance data , we find that the average mass number for region iv is about 202 . the constraints in equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) apply to any @xmath1-process scenario that yields the observed solar @xmath1-process abundance pattern .    the next constraint , which distinguishes our calculation from all earlier treatments , takes into account the meteoritic data on @xmath5i/@xmath15i and @xmath6hf/@xmath16hf . as stated in the introduction , wasserburg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) argued that the last @xmath1-process event contributing to the @xmath6hf in the early solar system could make only very little @xmath5i .",
    "their argument applies to both the case where the @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis was uniform over the galactic history and the case where the @xmath5i and @xmath6hf in the early solar system came only from the last supernova contribution to the protosolar system within @xmath99 yr of its formation .",
    "wasserburg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) showed that the amount of @xmath6hf in the early solar system is consistent with a uniform production scenario , which is also good for the actinides .",
    "according to this scenario , the last @xmath1-process event responsible for the @xmath5i in the early solar system should have occurred long ( @xmath100 yr ) before the last injection of @xmath6hf , which took place within @xmath99 yr of the solar system formation .",
    "consequently , there must be different @xmath1-process sources for @xmath5i and @xmath6hf .",
    "this difference is possibly related to a distinction between the @xmath35 and 126 closed neutron shells on the @xmath1-process path .",
    "based on the argument of wasserburg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we consider the following minimal scenario .",
    "we assume that there are two kinds of @xmath1-process events contributing to the solar @xmath1-process abundances near and above @xmath3 . the first kind of events ( case h ) are mainly responsible for the @xmath1-process nuclei near and above @xmath4 ( regions iii and iv ) .",
    "they also make a significant amount of the nuclei between @xmath3 and 195 ( region ii ) , including @xmath6hf , but very little @xmath5i .",
    "the @xmath1-process nuclei near @xmath3 ( region i ) and the bulk of those between @xmath3 and 195 are made in the second kind of events ( case l ) . in this",
    "scenario equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) can be rewritten as @xmath101 where for example , @xmath102 is the sum of progenitor abundances ( normalized according to eq . [ 5 ] ) in region i in case h , and @xmath103 is a weighting parameter to be determined by our calculation .",
    "physically , the weighting parameter @xmath103 depends on the amount of @xmath1-process material produced in a single event and the frequency of such events in both cases h and l. note that the quantities on the left - hand side of equation ( 11 ) , e.g. , @xmath104 , are proportional to the sums of solar @xmath1-process abundances in the corresponding regions , e.g. , @xmath105 , in equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) .",
    "ideally , we would like to have no production of @xmath5i at all in case h. practically , we can set an upper limit on the @xmath5i production in case h as follows .",
    "we assume that all the @xmath5i in the early solar system was produced by the @xmath1-process events in case h. this could be realized if the period between the last @xmath1-process event in case l and the solar system formation was long ( @xmath100 yr ) compared with the lifetime of @xmath5i ( @xmath106 yr ) .",
    "we assume that this is the case in the following discussion .",
    "meteoritic measurements give the abundance ratio @xmath107 in the early solar system , which corresponds to @xmath108 . in the uniform production scenario",
    "the abundance ratio @xmath109 in the early solar system is @xmath110 where @xmath111 stands for @xmath112 in case h , and @xmath113 yr is the period of galactic @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis prior to the solar system formation .",
    "the upper limit on the production of @xmath5i in case h is then @xmath114 in deriving the above upper limit we have assumed that the final abundances of @xmath5i and @xmath115pt are approximately the same as the progenitor abundances for @xmath116 and @xmath117 in case h. this assumption is reasonable because the @xmath2-delayed neutron emission probabilities of the progenitor nuclei at and immediately above @xmath118 and 195 are small and neutrino - induced neutron emission after freeze - out is severely constrained as discussed below .",
    "furthermore , it is believed that the abundance peaks at @xmath3 and 195 owe their existence to the slow @xmath2-decay rates of the progenitor nuclei at the @xmath35 and 126 closed neutron shells .",
    "in fact , kratz et al . (",
    "1988 ) showed that the product of the freeze - out progenitor abundance at the closed neutron shells and the corresponding @xmath2-decay rate is approximately constant , i.e. , a steady - state @xmath2-flow equilibrium approximately holds for these progenitor nuclei at freeze - out .",
    "accordingly , we adopt the constraint @xmath119 for @xmath3647 ( case l ) and 6568 ( case h ) in our @xmath1-process calculation . as pointed out by fuller & meyer ( 1995 ) ,",
    "the constraint in equation ( 14 ) is especially important when @xmath0 capture is included in the @xmath1-process calculation .",
    "it requires that @xmath2-decay be the dominant charge - changing reaction when the abundance peaks freeze out , i.e. , it restricts the @xmath0 flux at @xmath78 .",
    "finally , we consider the effects of neutrino - induced neutron emission after freeze - out .",
    "qian et al . (",
    "1997 ) and haxton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed that neutrino - induced neutron emission results in significant production of the nuclei in the valleys immediately below the abundance peaks even for moderate neutrino fluences after freeze - out . in order to produce the right amount of these nuclei ,",
    "the neutrino fluence @xmath120 after freeze - out has to be sufficiently low .",
    "for case h we have @xmath121 and for case l @xmath122 ( the upper limits on @xmath120 are 0.030 in case h and 0.045 in case l in order not to overproduce these nuclei in the valleys . )    the constraints in equations ( 9)(11 ) are treated in more accurate forms in earlier @xmath1-process network calculations , but those in equations ( 13 ) , ( 15 ) , and ( 16 ) have not been considered . while equation ( 14 ) is found to hold in earlier @xmath1-process calculations ( see e.g. , kratz et al .",
    "1993 ) , its validity is essentially guaranteed by the constraints in equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) in our calculation . in the future full network calculations will have to be carried out in order to include the @xmath5i and @xmath6hf data and allow for various neutrino effects . in this regard",
    ", our simplified @xmath1-process calculation serves as an illustration of the spirit , and hopefully , also as a stimulus for more sophisticated future studies .",
    "as stated earlier , there are three parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 in our simplified @xmath1-process calculation . before we present the results of our calculation ,",
    "it is helpful to discuss the physics that relates the set of these three parameters to the progenitor abundance pattern at freeze - out in case h or l. obviously , in both cases the neutron - to - seed ratio @xmath83 is related to the average progenitor mass number @xmath123 at freeze - out through equation ( 8) .",
    "the mass number @xmath31 of a progenitor nucleus is approximately proportional to its charge @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath124 , where the proportionality constant is @xmath1252.9 for the @xmath1-process path shown in fig .",
    "1 . therefore",
    ", the average progenitor charge @xmath126 at freeze - out is @xmath127 from equations ( 8) and ( 17 ) we obtain @xmath128 and we assume @xmath129 in the following discussion .",
    "because only charge - changing reactions are involved in equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , we can approximately view the @xmath1-process as a charge flow proceeding from @xmath130 to successively higher @xmath27 , accompanied by the capture of @xmath131 neutrons at each @xmath27 .",
    "when the neutrons run out at @xmath78 , the charges in the flow have an average value @xmath126 . without solving equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) for the charge flow",
    ", we can approximately calculate this average progenitor charge @xmath126 at freeze - out as @xmath132,\\ ] ] where @xmath133 is the average @xmath2-decay rate , and @xmath134 is the average initial @xmath0 capture rate [ proportional to @xmath81 ] , both appropriately taken for the progenitor nuclei involved in the calculation .",
    "equation ( 19 ) then relates @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and the freeze - out time @xmath136 to the progenitor abundance pattern at freeze - out in both cases h and l.    furthermore , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath136 are subject to the neutrino fluence constraints in equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) for cases h and l , respectively .",
    "therefore , one can use either @xmath81 or @xmath82 as the only adjustable parameter in the two cases .",
    "once chosen , the other parameter , together with the freeze - out time @xmath136 , is determined by the average progenitor charge at freeze - out ( eq . [ 19 ] ) and the neutrino fluence constraint ( eq . [ 15 ] or [ 16 ] ) in each case .      for the convenience of presentation , we first give results for a reasonable value of @xmath137 , which corresponds to @xmath138 s@xmath48 for the progenitor nuclei with @xmath35 .",
    "the dependence of our results on @xmath81 will be examined in  3.3 .",
    "our best fit for case h is obtained for @xmath139 s and @xmath140 .",
    "the corresponding freeze - out time is @xmath141 s. the time evolution of the progenitor abundance pattern in case h is shown in fig .",

    "the best fit for case l is obtained for @xmath142 s and @xmath143 , with the corresponding freeze - out time @xmath144 s. the time evolution of the progenitor abundance pattern in case l is shown in fig .",
    "3 . for a given @xmath81",
    ", we find that case h is specified essentially by the constraint on @xmath5i production in equation ( 13 ) and the neutrino fluence constraint in equation ( 15 ) . with the freeze - out pattern obtained in case h , case",
    "l is specified by the solar @xmath1-process abundance ratios in equation ( 11 ) and the neutrino fluence constraint in equation ( 16 ) .",
    "the weighting parameter in equation ( 11 ) is found to be @xmath145 . with the above best - fit parameters , all the constraints discussed in  2.2 are satisfied .",
    "the abundance pattern obtained from the superposition of cases h and l is shown in fig .",
    "4 . as explained previously , we can not compare this pattern with the solar @xmath1-process abundance distribution on a nucleus - by - nucleus basis , especially because we do not follow the transformation from the progenitor nuclei to the stable @xmath1-process nuclei after freeze - out .",
    "however , if we assume that the progenitor nuclei at the @xmath35 and 126 closed neutron shells approximately conserve their mass numbers during the transformation after freeze - out , the final abundances at these mass numbers ( regions i and iii ) shown in fig .",
    "4 agree with the solar @xmath1-process abundances in the @xmath3 and 195 peaks quite well . while we can not obtain detailed abundances for the @xmath1-process nuclei in regions ii and iv mainly due to significant @xmath2-delayed neutron emission after freeze - out expected in these two regions , at least the sums of the abundances in these two regions , together with those in regions i and iii , agree with the solar @xmath1-process abundance pattern as required by our calculation .",
    "furthermore , we can show that the abundance ratio @xmath6hf/@xmath16hf in the early solar system is also consistent with the meteoritic data and with the scenario where the @xmath1-process events in both cases h and l occurred uniformly up until the solar system formation . as explained previously",
    ", the constraint on @xmath5i production requires that the last @xmath1-process event in case l contributing to the solar abundances occur @xmath100 yr before the solar system formation . because the lifetime of @xmath6hf is @xmath146 yr , the @xmath6hf made in this last @xmath1-process event in case l had already decayed to the stable @xmath6w when the solar system was formed .",
    "following wasserburg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we take @xmath147 , where @xmath148 represents the @xmath1-process contribution to the solar abundance of @xmath6w . in the uniform production scenario",
    "we have @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 stand for the final abundances of @xmath6hf in cases h and l , respectively . assuming @xmath152 ( cf . figs . 2 and 3 ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath153 , which corresponds to @xmath154 in good agreement with the meteoritic value @xmath155 .",
    "in fact , we can always obtain this agreement as long as @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "we now examine the effect of @xmath0 capture on the charge flow . in our calculation equations ( 15 ) and",
    "( 16 ) , which concern the neutrino fluence after freeze - out , impose much more stringent constraints on the @xmath0 flux than equation ( 14 ) , which concerns the approximate @xmath2-flow equilibrium at freeze - out .",
    "this result was found earlier by qian et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . by the time the progenitor abundance pattern freezes out ,",
    "the charge flow is carried dominantly by @xmath2-decay in both cases h and l. however , whereas equation ( 14 ) is satisfied for all five progenitor nuclei ( @xmath3969 ) in the @xmath38 peak in case h , it is satisfied only for three progenitor nuclei ( @xmath15848 ) in the @xmath35 peak in case l. this is because the bottle - neck in the charge flow due to the slow @xmath2-decay rates for the @xmath35 progenitor nuclei facilitates the establishment of an approximate @xmath2-flow equilibrium in the @xmath38 peak in case h , whereas no corresponding bottle - neck exists before the @xmath35 progenitor nuclei in case l. on the other hand , @xmath0 capture accelerates the charge flow quite noticeably in both cases h and l.    we recall that for given values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , equation ( 19 ) determines the freeze - out time @xmath136 as a function of the average progenitor charge @xmath126 at freeze - out .",
    "here we give a more accurate way to evaluate this function .",

    "it is easy to see that equation ( 19 ) is obtained by replacing @xmath166 and @xmath167 for @xmath168 with @xmath133 and @xmath134 in equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) . using equations ( 21)(23 ) , we plot @xmath136 as a function of the average progenitor charge @xmath126 at freeze - out for @xmath137 , @xmath139 and 0.125 s , and for the case without neutrinos in fig .",
    "the time required to reach the same average progenitor charge at freeze - out is clearly longer without neutrinos than with neutrinos .",
    "the actual freeze - out times @xmath136 in cases h and l are indicated as filled circles in fig .",
    "the shortening of @xmath136 in both cases with respect to the case without neutrinos ( see  3.2 ) mainly results from the @xmath0-capture - induced acceleration of the charge flow at @xmath3649 , i.e. , at the progenitor nuclei with the @xmath35 closed neutron shell .    to conclude this subsection , we give a semi - analytic way to derive @xmath82 and @xmath83 in cases h and l for a given @xmath81 . as discussed in the beginning of  3 , the neutron - to - seed ratio @xmath83 is approximately given by the average progenitor charge @xmath126 at freeze - out via equation ( 18 ) . from the solar @xmath1-process abundance ratios in equation ( 11 ) and",
    "the constraint on @xmath5i production in equation ( 13 ) , we see that a large fraction of the progenitor abundances should be in region iii ( i ) at freeze - out in case h ( l ) . consequently , the average progenitor charge at freeze - out has to be @xmath16969 ( 4849 ) in case h ( l ) , which requires a neutron - to - seed ratio of @xmath17096 ( 4042 ) in good agreement with our numerical results .",
    "once @xmath126 is known , the freeze - out time @xmath136 can be calculated as a function of @xmath82 for a given @xmath81 using equations ( 21)(23 ) .",
    "the contours for @xmath171 , 49 , 68 , and 69 are shown as solid lines on the @xmath82-@xmath136 plot in fig .",
    "furthermore , the neutrino fluence constraint in equation ( 15 ) or ( 16 ) gives @xmath136 as another function of @xmath82 for a given @xmath81 .",
    "the contours for values of the neutrino fluence after freeze - out @xmath172 and 0.031 are shown as dashed lines in fig .",
    "the best - fit parameters for @xmath136 and @xmath82 in case h ( l ) should then lie on the dashed line for @xmath172 ( 0.031 ) and between the solid lines for @xmath173 ( 48 ) and 69 ( 49 ) .",
    "this is confirmed by our numerical results , which are indicated as filled circles in fig .",
    "we now consider the case without neutrinos , i.e. , @xmath174 .",
    "obviously , the neutrino fluence constraints in equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) can no longer be satisfied , and can only be treated as some upper limits on the neutrino fluence after freeze - out in this case . by leaving out neutrinos and the associated constraints in equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) , we also find freeze - out progenitor abundance patterns that can satisfy essentially all the other constraints discussed in  2.2 .",
    "these freeze - out progenitor abundance patterns corresponding to cases h@xmath175 and l@xmath175 are similar to those in cases h and l presented in  3.1 , but are obtained with slightly smaller neutron - to - seed ratios and considerably longer freeze - out times . the neutron - to - seed ratio in case h@xmath175",
    "( l@xmath175 ) is @xmath176 ( 44 ) with the corresponding freeze - out time @xmath177 ( 0.78 ) s. as shown in fig . 5 , approximately the same average progenitor charge at freeze - out",

    "the weighting parameter in equation ( 11 ) is @xmath178 for case l@xmath175 with respect to case h@xmath175 in order to give the best fit to the gross solar @xmath1-process abundance pattern . the time evolution of the progenitor abundance pattern in the case without neutrinos is shown in fig .",
    "7 .    here",
    "we notice some interesting differences between cases h@xmath175 ( l@xmath175 ) and h ( l ) .",
    "case h@xmath175 is essentially determined by the constraint on @xmath5i production in equation ( 13 ) . due to the slow @xmath2-decay rates for the progenitor nuclei with @xmath35 , a long @xmath136",
    "is required to decrease the progenitor abundance at @xmath118 .",
    "however , once the charge flow passes the bottle - neck at @xmath35 , it reaches the progenitor nuclei at @xmath43 relatively fast .",
    "consequently , the @xmath1-process nuclei at @xmath43 are overproduced by about 40% in case h@xmath175 in order to satisfy the constraint on @xmath5i production in equation ( 13 ) . by comparison , the decaying @xmath0 flux in case h",
    "has the beneficial effect of accelerating the passage through the bottle - neck at @xmath35 at an earlier time without overproducing the @xmath1-process nuclei at @xmath43 at later times .",
    "furthermore , without neutrinos the approximate @xmath2-flow equilibrium constraint in equation ( 14 ) is satisfied only for two progenitor nuclei @xmath17948 ) in the @xmath35 peak in case l@xmath175 .",
    "therefore , while we can not conclude that neutrinos are required to satisfy all the constraints derived from the observed solar @xmath1-process abundance data , the cases with neutrinos seem to be more attractive .      we have presented the results for a fixed value of @xmath137 in  3.1 and for the case without neutrinos corresponding to @xmath174 in  3.2 .",
    "we now examine the dependence of our results on @xmath81 while taking into account all the constraints discussed in  2.2 . in other words , we want to find those cases that are similar to case h or l , but have different values of @xmath81 .",
    "as explained at the end of  3.1 , the solar @xmath1-process abundance ratios in equation ( 11 ) and the constraint on @xmath5i production in equation ( 13 ) require that the average progenitor charge at freeze - out be @xmath17369 ( 4849 ) in case h ( l ) .",
    "consequently , the neutron - to - seed ratio @xmath83 in those cases similar to case h ( l ) has to be close to 9496 ( 4042 ) .",
    "the other two parameters in our calculation , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , together with the freeze - out time @xmath136 , are constrained by the average progenitor charge @xmath126 at freeze - out and the neutrino fluence @xmath120 after freeze - out ( eq . [ 15 ] or [ 16 ] ) in each case .",
    "therefore , the combination of @xmath81 and @xmath82 in those cases similar to case h would most likely be located in the region between the contour lines for @xmath180=(68,0.015)$ ] and @xmath181 on the @xmath82 vs. @xmath81 plot .",
    "likewise , the combination of @xmath81 and @xmath82 in those cases similar to case l would most likely be located in the region between the contour lines for @xmath180=(48,0.031)$ ] and @xmath182 on the same plot .",
    "this plot is shown as fig .",
    "obviously , the parameter regions shown in fig . 8 include the best - fit parameters in cases h and l. we have checked a number of other combinations of @xmath81 and @xmath82 within these regions , and have confirmed that they give similar results to those discussed previously . in particular , the results corresponding to @xmath183 are very close to those in the case without neutrinos .    furthermore ,",
    "although the parameter @xmath82 in case l is shorter than that in case h for the same @xmath81 , we can find a case l@xmath184 that has a smaller @xmath81 and a longer @xmath82 than both cases h and l ( see fig . 8) , and at the same time , gives a freeze - out progenitor abundance pattern essentially identical to that in case l. specifically , the parameters are @xmath185 [ corresponding to @xmath186 s@xmath48 for the progenitor nuclei with @xmath35 ] , @xmath188 s , and @xmath189 in case l@xmath184 .",
    "the corresponding freeze - out time is @xmath190 s. with the same weighting parameter @xmath145 in equation ( 11 ) , cases h and l@xmath184 give the same best - fit to the gross solar @xmath1-process abundance pattern as cases h and l. it follows that a range of @xmath81 and @xmath82 within the regions shown in fig .",
    "8 can provide the yields in cases h and l.",
    "we have found that the gross solar @xmath1-process abundance pattern near and above @xmath3 can be reproduced by a superposition of two kinds of supernova @xmath1-process events after taking into account the meteoritic data on @xmath5i and @xmath6hf .",
    "the first kind of events ( case h ) are mainly responsible for the @xmath1-process nuclei near and above @xmath4 .",
    "they also make a significant amount of the nuclei between @xmath3 and 195 , including @xmath6hf , but very little @xmath5i .",
    "the @xmath1-process nuclei near @xmath3 and the bulk of those between @xmath3 and 195 are made in the second kind of events ( case l ) . in each case , the @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis in a mass element expanding away from the protoneutron star is governed by the initial @xmath0 flux @xmath81 at the beginning of the @xmath1-process , the decay timescale @xmath82 of the @xmath0 flux , and the neutron - to - seed ratio @xmath83 .",
    "the parameter @xmath83 specifies the @xmath1-process nuclei mainly produced in each case .",
    "the other two parameters , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , are important in determining when all the neutrons are used up , i.e. , the freeze - out time @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , they determine the neutrino fluence @xmath120 after freeze - out , which may be responsible for the production of certain @xmath1-process nuclei through neutrino - induced neutron emission ( qian et al .",
    "1997 ; haxton et al .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0 flux plays a significant , possibly even crucial role in decreasing the production of @xmath5i with respect to @xmath6hf in case h. in both cases h and l , the solar @xmath1-process abundance ratios in equation ( 11 ) and the constraint on @xmath5i production in equation ( 13 ) determine the average progenitor charge @xmath126 at freeze - out , and hence the neutron - to - seed ratio @xmath83 . for a given @xmath81 , the parameter @xmath82 , together with the freeze - out time @xmath136 , can be calculated from @xmath126 and the neutrino fluence constraint ( eq . [ 15 ] or [ 16 ] ) for each case , as shown in fig .",
    "the dependence of @xmath82 on @xmath81 is shown in fig .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the meteoritic constraint on coproduction of @xmath5i with @xmath6hf leads to well - defined parameters , especially the neutron - to - seed ratio , in case h. as illustrated by the case without neutrinos , it is difficult to suppress the production of @xmath5i , which has an @xmath35 progenitor nucleus with a long @xmath2-decay lifetime , and to avoid overproduction of the @xmath1-process nuclei at @xmath43 at the same time .",
    "when @xmath0 capture is included in the @xmath1-process calculation , this difficulty is noticeably alleviated .",
    "however , the parameters characterizing the @xmath0 flux are then subject to additional constraints .",
    "consequently , case h represents a particular kind of @xmath1-process events with possibly a very narrow range of neutron - to - seed ratios ( @xmath191 ) . on the other hand , although we have shown that the gross solar @xmath1-process abundance pattern near and above @xmath3 can be accounted for in the minimal scenario of two kinds of @xmath1-process events , the progenitor abundance pattern in case l can be regarded as some average over different events spanning a broader range of neutron - to - seed ratios ( e.g. , @xmath19250 ) , as long as these events occur infrequently enough to be consistent with the meteoritic data on @xmath5i and @xmath6hf .",
    "according to wasserburg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the events in case h occur roughly once every @xmath61 yr , whereas those represented by case l occur roughly once every @xmath193 yr within a region of @xmath194 pc in size in the galaxy .",
    "the size of @xmath194 pc may be understood from the expansion of the supernova ejecta . for an explosion energy of @xmath195 erg ,",
    "the initial velocity of the supernova ejecta is @xmath196 km s@xmath48 . in about a few @xmath197 yr",
    ", the supernova sweeps over a distance of about 6 pc and mixes with about the same amount of the interstellar medium as the total mass @xmath198 of the original ejecta . at times",
    "@xmath199 yr , the expansion ( commonly known as `` snow plowing '' ) under momentum conservation is described by @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the radius of the expansion front from the center of the supernova , @xmath202 is the expansion time since the supernova explosion , @xmath203 is the density of the interstellar medium , and @xmath204 is the mass of the hydrogen atom .",
    "if we ignore other means of mixing such as galactic rotation , clearly only those supernovae that could reach the position of the protosun within the lifetime of @xmath6hf ( @xmath7 yr ) were responsible for the @xmath6hf in the early solar system . from equation ( 24 )",
    ", those supernovae occurred within @xmath205 pc from the position of the protosun for reasonable values of the relevant parameters .",
    "interestingly , within the lifetime of @xmath6hf , the number of supernovae in a region of @xmath205 pc in size is about one assuming a total galactic volume of @xmath206 kpc@xmath207 and a supernova frequency of @xmath208 in the whole galaxy .",
    "therefore , @xmath6hf can be replenished on a timescale of @xmath99 yr consistent with the meteoritic data if the supernova @xmath1-process events in case h occur with a frequency of @xmath209 in the whole galaxy , as also argued by wasserburg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the meteoritic data require that the @xmath5i produced along with @xmath15i be replenished on a much longer timescale of @xmath100 yr . because the lifetimes of @xmath5i and @xmath6hf are very close , the regions enclosing the supernovae contributing to these two nuclei have about the same size .",
    "consequently , those supernova @xmath1-process events represented by case l must occur with a frequency of @xmath210 in the whole galaxy .",
    "the frequencies @xmath211 and @xmath212 , together with the corresponding amounts of @xmath1-process ejecta @xmath213 and @xmath214 in cases h and l , determine the superposition parameter @xmath103 in equation ( 11 ) . as found in  3 , we have @xmath2152 .",
    "so the amount of @xmath1-process material ejected in the less frequent case",
    "l is @xmath820 times more than that in the more frequent case h. this implies that the mass loss rate is much higher , or more likely , that the period for ejecting @xmath1-process material is much longer in case l than in case h.    following the preceding arguments for two distinct @xmath1-process sources , we propose the following @xmath1-process scenario assuming that all of the type ii supernovae producing @xmath1-process nuclei are of a generally similar nature .",
    "we suggest that material with higher neutron - to - seed ratios is ejected in the neutrino - driven winds at higher neutrino luminosities , i.e. , at earlier times during the neutrino cooling phase of the protoneutron star .",
    "in addition , the early @xmath1-process ejecta have a neutron - to - seed ratio of @xmath191 . the neutron - to - seed ratio then rapidly decreases to @xmath21650 .",
    "if neutrino emission were uninterrupted , the neutron - to - seed ratio would stay @xmath21650 , and the corresponding amount of material , all ejected , would be @xmath820 times more than the amount of material with @xmath191 .",
    "however , we consider that the continuous mass loss in the neutrino - driven winds is commonly terminated during the rapid transition from @xmath191 to @xmath21650",
    ". this would occur in @xmath217% of the type ii supernovae , with only @xmath8% of them having prolonged continuous mass loss . depending on the initial core mass of the supernova progenitor , among other things , both neutrino emission and mass loss",
    "could be terminated by black hole formation during the neutrino cooling phase of the protoneutron star ( brown & bethe 1994 ) . in this scenario there",
    "would then be @xmath9 black holes with masses @xmath10 from the @xmath1-process events in case h and @xmath11 neutron stars from the less frequent @xmath1-process events represented by case l in the galaxy today .    in the above @xmath1-process scenario we have associated high neutron - to - seed ratios with high neutrino luminosities and low neutron - to - seed ratios with low neutrino luminosities .",
    "qualitatively , a shorter @xmath82 is expected for a higher neutrino luminosity ( qian & woosley 1996 ) .",
    "this can be achieved in the framework of the present model ( cf .",
    "cases h and l@xmath184 in fig . 8) . of course , a consistent set of the three parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 at different times during the neutrino cooling phase of the protoneutron star can only be obtained in a detailed numerical study of type ii supernovae .",
    "we note that many other nuclear species are produced by the explosive nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , fe and si ) in type ii supernovae and by the hydrostatic burning ( e.g. , @xmath218o ) in the outer envelope during the presupernova evolution .",
    "the explosive nucleosynthesis is associated with the shock propagation through the envelope .",
    "the products from both the explosive nucleosynthesis and the hydrostatic burning are largely unaffected by the neutrinos from the protoneutron star [ except for the @xmath219-process discussed by woosley et al .",
    "( 1990 ) ] or by the possible formation of a black hole during the neutrino cooling phase of the protoneutron star .",
    "therefore , the abundant non-@xmath1-process nuclei are ejected together with the @xmath1-process elements in a type ii supernova .",
    "the scenario given here would not significantly alter the usual supernova contributions to the non-@xmath1-process nuclei .",
    "furthermore , we note that neutrino - driven winds also develop after the accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of a white dwarf into a neutron star ( woosley & baron 1992 ) .",
    "therefore , the aic events could also correspond to the infrequent @xmath1-process events represented by case l. however , because there is no envelope around the final neutron star in the aic events , the overall nucleosynthetic signature of such events is different from that of type ii supernovae . only the nuclear species produced in the neutrino - driven winds , especially the @xmath1-process nuclei ,",
    "are ejected in the aic events .    finally , the diversity of @xmath1-process sources have some interesting consequences for galactic chemical evolution . at very low metallicities ,",
    "only type ii supernovae could make fe , whereas both type ia and type ii supernovae contribute to fe at sufficiently high metallicities .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath1-process events in case h were mainly associated with type ii supernovae , the abundance ratio of the corresponding main @xmath1-process product with respect to fe would remain constant at low metallicities and decrease with increasing metallicity after type ia supernovae began to make fe . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath1-process events represented by case l were mainly associated with the aic events , the metallicity dependence for the abundance ratio of the corresponding main @xmath1-process product with respect to fe would be sensitive to the difference between the time at which such events first occurred and the onset of increase in metallicity due to type ia supernova .    the above suggestions regarding the nature of supernova @xmath1-process events are highly speculative",
    ". however , if the binary distribution of @xmath1-process sources with very different frequencies and very different mass contributions is correct , then some new supernova @xmath1-process models will be required along the general lines indicated here .    we want to thank gerry brown and sterl phinney for helpful discussions .",

    "<S> we present a simplified analysis using equations for the charge flow , which include @xmath0 capture , for the production of @xmath1-process nuclei in the context of the recent supernova hot bubble model . </S>",
    "<S> the role of @xmath0 capture in speeding up the charge flow , particularly at the closed neutron shells , is studied together with the @xmath2-flow at freeze - out and the effect of neutrino - induced neutron emission on the abundance pattern after freeze - out . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a semi - quantitative agreement with the gross solar @xmath1-process abundance pattern from the peak at mass number @xmath3 , through the peak at @xmath4 , and up to the region of the actinides can be obtained by a superposition of two distinctive kinds of @xmath1-process events . </S>",
    "<S> these correspond to a low frequency case l and a high frequency case h , which takes into account the low abundance of @xmath5i and the high abundance of @xmath6hf in the early solar nebula . </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime of @xmath6hf ( @xmath7 yr ) associates the events in case h with the most common type ii supernovae . these events would be mainly responsible for the @xmath1-process nuclei near and above @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> they would also make a significant amount of the nuclei between @xmath3 and 195 , including @xmath6hf , but very little @xmath5i . in order to match the solar @xmath1-process abundance pattern and to satisfy the @xmath5i and @xmath6hf constraints , the events in case l , which would make the @xmath1-process nuclei near @xmath3 and the bulk of those between @xmath3 and 195 , </S>",
    "<S> must occur @xmath8 times less frequently but eject @xmath820 times more @xmath1-process material in each event .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming that all of the supernovae producing @xmath1-process nuclei represent a similar overall process , we speculate that the usual neutron star remnants , and hence prolonged ejection of @xmath1-process material , are associated with the events in case l. we further speculate that the more frequently occurring events in case h have ejection of other @xmath1-process material terminated by black hole formation during the neutrino cooling phase of the protoneutron star . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that there is now an inventory of @xmath9 black holes with masses @xmath10 and @xmath11 neutron stars resulting from supernovae in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath1-process model would have little effect on the estimates of the supernova contributions to the non-@xmath1-process nuclei . </S>"
