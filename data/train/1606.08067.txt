    "high - energy small - angle hadron - hadron scattering is dominated by the exchange of the soft pomeron .",
    "the nature of this pomeron has been discussed in a great number of articles ; for reviews see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "it is clear that it has vacuum internal quantum numbers .",
    "what is much less clear is the spin structure of the soft pomeron .",
    "indeed , the present authors have frequently been asked the following question : the pomeron has vacuum quantum numbers , should it then not also have spin zero ? however , a vector pomeron is widely used in the literature following @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was proposed to describe the soft pomeron as an effective rank-2 symmetric tensor exchange .",
    "there , all reggeon exchanges with charge conjugation @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) were described as effective tensor ( vector ) exchanges and a large number of the couplings of these objects to hadrons were determined from experimental data .",
    "this tensor - pomeron model was then applied to various reactions in @xcite .",
    "the authoritative answer to the question for the spin structure of the soft pomeron should be given by experiment .",
    "in this article we want to show that experimental data on the helicity structure of small-@xmath11 proton - proton high - energy elastic scattering from the star experiment @xcite indeed give decisive information on the spin structure of the soft pomeron .",
    "we emphasise that in the following we shall be interested only in soft hadronic scattering where , according to standard wisdom , perturbative qcd methods can not be applied .",
    "we will consider @xmath12 elastic scattering @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the four - momenta and @xmath15 the helicity indices , respectively .",
    "the standard kinematic variables are @xmath16 at high energies , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , the reaction ( [ pp_reaction ] ) is dominated by pomeron exchange ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : pp_scattering ] . in the following all non - leading reggeon exchanges will be neglected . for @xmath19",
    "their contribution to the total cross section is only @xmath20 @xcite .     ]",
    "we shall test three hypotheses for the pomeron and the effective pomeron - proton - proton ( @xmath21 ) vertex .",
    "we shall treat the pomeron either as a scalar , a vector , or a rank-2 symmetric tensor exchange .",
    "for all three cases it turns out to be possible to adjust the effective pomeron propagators and the couplings in such a way that at high energies the helicity - conserving @xmath12 amplitudes have the standard form as given in the vector - pomeron model due to donnachie and landshoff ; see @xcite and @xcite",
    ". we will choose the parameters for the scalar and the tensor pomeron accordingly .",
    "here we describe the pomeron , as discussed in @xcite , as a symmetric , rank - two , tensor @xmath23 and its interaction with protons by coupling it to a tensor current @xmath24 , @xmath25 \\psi_{p}(x)\\ , ; \\end{split}\\ ] ] see ( 6.27 ) of @xcite . here",

    "thus , we get for a vector pomeron @xmath78 and hence from ( [ sigma_tot ] ) @xmath79 clearly , this result does not make sense for a non - vanishing cross section and would contradict the rules of quantum field theory .",

    "the latter observation is in agreement with our results and which also imply only a weak @xmath11-dependence of @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , we can approximately set @xmath90 in ( [ r5_tensor ] ) and ( [ r5_scalar ] ) and obtain with @xmath82 @xmath91 it is worth pointing out that in the high - energy limit ( @xmath92 ) these results have very small remaining uncertainties since only the pomeron intercept @xmath93 enters which is rather well determined experimentally .",
    "however , as the result for the tensor pomeron is very small in absolute terms , it is conceivable that in this case subleading terms might be relevant for a calculation of @xmath0 with very high precision .",
    "but as we will see momentarily , the current experimental uncertainty does not allow a determination of @xmath0 to that precision anyway .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] we show the experimental result for @xmath0 of @xcite ( as given in fig .  5 there ) together with our results ( [ r5_tensor_result ] ) and ( [ r5_scalar_result ] ) .",
    "clearly , the tensor - pomeron result is perfectly compatible with the experiment . the scalar - pomeron result , on the other hand , is far outside the experimental error ellipse .",
    "the tensor pomeron is hence strongly favoured by the data , while the scalar pomeron is ruled out .     +",
    "in this article we have confronted three hypotheses for the soft pomeron ",
    "tensor , vector , and scalar  with experimental data on polarised high - energy @xmath12 elastic scattering from the star collaboration @xcite . studying the ratio @xmath0 of single - helicity - flip to non - flip amplitudes we found that the star data are consistent with a tensor pomeron while they clearly exclude a scalar pomeron .",
    "we have further argued that a vector pomeron assumption is in contradiction to the rules of quantum field theory .",
    "we therefore conclude that the tensor pomeron is the only viable option .",
    "attempts to relate the pomeron to tensors were , in fact , already discussed in the 1960 s @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the energy - momentum tensor was considered and from that and some further assumptions the ratio of meson - baryon to baryon - baryon cross sections was obtained giving , for instance , @xmath94 here @xmath95 and @xmath96 are a mean meson mass , taken as the one of the @xmath97 meson , and a mean baryon mass , respectively .",
    "this does not work phenomenologically , as in fact @xmath98 .",
    "also , we can not see the physics which would make the @xmath99 cross section proportional to the @xmath97 mass .    in this connection",
    "we may discuss the consequences of the hypothesis that the tensor current @xmath100 in is proportional to the energy - momentum tensor with a _",
    "universal _ constant of proportionality , independent of the hadron considered .",
    "it is easy to see that this leads to the same pomeron part of the total cross section for all hadron - hadron scatterings , for instance @xmath101 .",
    "clearly , also this does not work phenomenologically .",
    "our @xmath100 in be universally proportional to the energy - momentum tensor",
    ".    in @xcite attempts were made to relate the pomeron properties , in particular its couplings to hadrons , to those of tensor mesons of the @xmath102 type .",
    "however , with the advent of qcd and gluons it has become clear that the pomeron is a predominantly gluonic object ; see the pioneering papers @xcite .",
    "thus , if one wants to relate the pomeron properties to mesonic ones it is natural to look for glueballs , and this , indeed , has been and is being done frequently . here",
    ", one problem is that even today the status of glueballs is not particularly clear ; for a review see @xcite . a vast literature exists dealing with the pomeron in perturbative qcd , starting from the celebrated work @xcite .",
    "questions similar to those addressed in the present paper for the soft pomeron could be interesting also in the context of the perturbative pomeron , but this would be beyond the scope of the present paper .    for the soft pomeron phenomenology , for a long time then , a sort of vector pomeron was commonly used , following @xcite , although it was clear that this could not be completely correct due to the problems with charge conjugation explained in section  [ sec : discussion_and_comparison ] .",
    "a first attempt to understand the soft pomeron in the framework of a toy model of nonperturbative qcd was made in @xcite . in @xcite functional integral techniques",
    "were used to analyse high - energy soft hadron - hadron scattering in qcd in a nonperturbative framework .",
    "it was shown in chapter  6 of @xcite that the pomeron exchange can be understood as a coherent sum of exchanges of spin @xmath103 .",
    "going through the arguments there one can see that basically this structure is due to the helicity conserving fundamental quark - gluon coupling in qcd . in @xcite",
    "a tensor pomeron was introduced which again can be viewed as a coherent sum of exchanges of spin @xmath103 ( see appendix  b of @xcite ) thus making contact with the considerations in qcd of @xcite .",
    "we note that writing a regge exchange as a coherent sum of elementary spin exchanges goes back to @xcite .",
    "concerning specific experimental tests for the spin structure of the pomeron we should mention @xcite where such tests were proposed for diffractive deep inelastic electron - proton scattering .",
    "similar techniques were proposed in @xcite for central production of meson resonances in @xmath12 collisions @xmath104 in the light of our discussion here we can not support the conclusions of @xcite that the pomeron couples like a non - conserved vector current . in @xcite the question of central production ( [ pp_pmp ] ) was taken up again from the point of view of the tensor pomeron and it was shown that this does quite well in reproducing the data where available .",
    "it turned out , however , that central production with pomeron - pomeron fusion , @xmath105 was not too sensitive to the nature of the pomeron , tensor or vector .",
    "but central production with fusion of a @xmath10 object with the pomeron , e.g. @xmath106 is extremely sensitive to the nature of pomeron . for a tensor ( vector )",
    "pomeron the @xmath107 pair in ( [ gampom_pipi ] ) is in an antisymmetric ( symmetric ) state under the exchange @xmath108 .",
    "needless to say that since the pomeron has @xmath9 the @xmath107 pair in ( [ gampom_pipi ] ) must be in an antisymmetric state .",
    "thus also from this point , a vector pomeron is excluded . finally , also",
    "investigations of the pomeron using the ads / cft correspondence prefer a tensor nature for pomeron exchange @xcite .    according to the results for the helicity - amplitudes in polarised high - energy @xmath12 elastic scattering presented in this work",
    "the soft pomeron should be described as a rank-2 symmetric tensor exchange , as for example in the model of @xcite .",
    "it is not a priori clear that the pomeron exhibits the same spin structure also in reactions involving high momentum transfers , i.e.   reactions with the exchange of a hard ( perturbative ) pomeron .",
    "we would find it particularly desirable to study the spin structure of the pomeron in the interesting transition region between soft and hard reactions .",
    "it would therefore be useful to discuss further observables that are sensitive to the spin structure of the pomeron and that can be experimentally studied in a wide range of kinematic regimes .",
