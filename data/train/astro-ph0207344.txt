    "since its launch in december 1998 , the _ submillimeter wave astronomy satellite _ ( swas ; melnick et al .",
    "2000 ) has detected water vapor in more than 70 molecular clouds by means of observations the @xmath6 transition of ortho - h@xmath3o ( e.g. snell et al .",
    "2000 ; ashby et al .",
    "2000 ; neufeld et al .",
    "while emission - line observations form the core of the swas program on interstellar water vapor , absorption - line observations are possible toward a few bright continuum sources ; these include sagittarius b2 ( neufeld et al .",
    "2000b ; hereafter n00 ) , sagittarius a , w49 , and w51 .",
    "absorption - line observations typically probe the water vapor abundance in several kinematically - distinct foreground clouds lying along the line - of - sight to the source ( e.g. n00 ) . under typical interstellar conditions ,",
    "most water molecules are in the lower state of the @xmath6 transition ( i.e. in the ground state of ortho - water ) ; thus absorption line observations have the distinct advantage of yielding water vapor column densities that are insensitive both to the physical conditions in the absorbing cloud and to the assumed rate coefficients for collisional excitation of water .",
    "typically , the h@xmath7o absorption line is very optically - thick , yielding only a lower limit on the water column density , but observations of _ optically - thin _",
    "absorption by the h@xmath8o isotopologue ( less abundant by a factor of 250500 ) have led to a quantitative determination of the water column densities in foreground clouds along the sgr b2 sight - line ( n00 ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we report the results of similar observations carried out towards the star - forming region w51 .",
    "the results are particularly intriguing , because they provide our first detection of a h@xmath7o absorption line which is of only _ moderate _ optical depth .",
    "this feature , observed at an lsr velocity @xmath9  km  s@xmath0 , originates in a diffuse foreground cloud in the which the water column density is small .",
    "this cloud has previously been detected by means of 21  cm absorption - line observations ( koo 1997 ) : the inferred hi column density is @xmath10 .",
    "spaans et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter s98 ) have argued that measurements of oh and h@xmath3o column densities in diffuse clouds provide a valuable probe of the chemistry of interstellar oxygen molecules ; in particular , the oh / h@xmath3o abundance ratio serves to constrain the branching ratio for the dissociative recombination of the molecular ion h@xmath11o@xmath12 , a crucial parameter in chemical models for both diffuse and dense molecular clouds .",
    "accordingly , we have used the arecibo observatory ( ao ) to carry out oh absorption line observations toward the same source , the results of which are also presented here .    the observations and data reduction are described in  2 below , and the observational results presented in  3 . in  4 we discuss the derived water and oh column densities and the constraints that they place upon the oxygen chemistry in molecular clouds .",
    "our swas observations of w51 were carried out during the period 1999 april 16  2001 april 19 with the @xmath13 elliptical swas beam centered at position @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( j2000 ) .",
    "all the data were acquired in standard nodded observations ( melnick et al .",
    "2000 ) and were reduced using the standard swas pipeline .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 58.6 hours .",
    "ao observations of the 1612 , 1665 , 1667 , and 1720 mhz lines of oh were obtained on 2001 november 30 and 2001 december 3 towards the swas - observed position and nine offset positions of widely varying continuum flux .",
    "the goal of observing oh towards these offset positions was to allow inferences to be drawn about the line excitation temperatures ( see  3.2 below ) .",
    "the offsets and on - source integration times for each observed position are given in table 1 , all positional offsets being expressed relative to the swas - observed position .",
    "the ao data were obtained in a series of standard nodded observations in which the source and reference positions were alternately observed for a period of 5 minutes each . the reference position was chosen to have an r.a .",
    "offset of 5  ( cos@xmath16)@xmath17 minutes of time so that the source and reference positions were observed over identical tracks in azimuth and elevation .",
    "calibration measurements were carried out using the noise diode after each source / reference position pair , and calibration observations of an astronomical continuum source were performed at the beginning of each day s observations .",
    "figure 1 shows the complete spectrum of the @xmath18 556.936 ghz transition of h@xmath3o obtained by swas toward w51 .",
    "the continuum antenna temperature , @xmath19 , measured toward w51 was 0.35  k ( double sideband ) , corresponding to a 550 ghz continuum flux density of @xmath20  jy .",
    "the quantity plotted in figure 1 is the ratio of flux density to continuum flux density , given by @xmath21 / \\ , 0.5 \\ , t_{ac}^*$ ] under the assumption that the sideband gains are equal .",
    "the swas beam size is @xmath22 ( fwhm ) at 550 ghz . the fitted line at @xmath23  km  s@xmath0 is the best - fit absorption line for a cloud that is assumed to completely cover the source .",
    "the derived cloud parameters are a line center optical depth @xmath24 of 1.5 , a doppler parameter is defined ( as usual ) such that the optical depth drops by a factor e=2.718 ... at a velocity shift @xmath25 from line center .",
    "the corresponding fwhm obtained from a gaussian fit to the absorption line is 3.4  km  s@xmath0 . ]",
    "@xmath25 of 1.5  km  s@xmath0 , and cloud lsr velocity of 6.0  km  s@xmath0 . under the conditions typical of diffuse",
    "interstellar clouds , the population in the @xmath26 rotational state of water is very small and thus the effects of stimulated emission on the @xmath18 optical depth can be neglected .",
    "the column density of water in the 1@xmath27 state is straightforwardly obtained as @xmath28  @xmath29 .",
    "if the ortho - para ratio for water is 3 , the implied total water column density is @xmath30  @xmath29 .",
    "the water abundance relative to hi is @xmath31 .",
    "figure 2 shows the oh spectra obtained at ao towards the ten positions observed in w51 .",
    "these spectra show the ratio of beam - averaged brightness temperature , @xmath32 , to continuum brightness temperature , @xmath33 .",
    "the beam - averaged brightness temperature of the radiation incident upon the ao antenna is computed according to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the antenna temperature , @xmath36 is the aperture efficiency  including atmospheric losses , as determined from calibration observations of an astronomical continuum source  and @xmath37  k is the temperature of the cosmic background radiation ( which is  chopped out \" by our observing procedure ) .",
    "the size of the arecibo main beam is @xmath38 ( fwhm ) at 1666 mhz .",
    "the continuum brightness temperatures , @xmath33 , measured for each position are shown in table 1 , along with the measured equivalent width , @xmath39  in units of km s@xmath0  for each of the observed oh lines . here , @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40 \\ ,",
    "dv$ ] , so that a negative value of @xmath39 implies an absorption line and a positive value an emission line . because of strong radio frequency interference , the 1720 mhz line strength could be measured reliably only toward the swas - observed ( 0,0 ) position where the absolute line strength was largest .",
    "the results shown in table 1 imply that the ratio of equivalent widths departs greatly from the 1:5:9:1 value expected in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) for @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , the 1665 mhz / 1667 mhz absorption line ratio is considerably smaller than the lte value and the 1612 mhz / 1667 mhz ratio considerably larger .",
    "moreover , the 1720 mhz line is observed in emission toward the ( 0,0 ) position , indicating the presence of weak maser amplification .    for lines of small optical depth",
    ", the equivalent width is related to the oh column density and the excitation temperature , @xmath42 , by the expression @xmath43 \\ , [ t_{ex}/{\\rm k}]^{-1 } \\ , [ 1 - t_{ex}/ t_{bc } ] \\ , \\rm km \\",
    ", s^{-1 } \\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath44 = @xmath45 , @xmath46 , 1 and @xmath45 respectively for the 1612 , 1665 , 1667 and 1720 mhz transitions .",
    "the ratios and signs of the equivalent widths observed toward the ( 0,0 ) position imply that @xmath47 .",
    "assuming that all the excitation temperatures are small compared to @xmath33 at the ( 0,0 ) position ( i.e. small compared to 500  k ) , we find the ratio of excitation temperatures to be @xmath48 .",
    "unfortunately , because the equivalent widths are a function of _ two _ unknowns  @xmath49 and @xmath42  the oh column density and excitation can not be derived independently for any given sight - line .",
    "however , as we argue below , the variation of the equivalent widths with the background continuum brightness temperature , @xmath33 , for the ten sight - lines we observed , provides a strong argument that the entire region is covered by a large foreground cloud in which the oh column density and excitation are nearly constant .",
    "this in turn allows us to derive an estimate of @xmath49 .    in figure 3 ( upper panel )",
    ", we show the equivalent widths measured for each transition and each observed position as a function of the background continuum brightness temperature , @xmath33 .",
    "we note immediately that the equivalent width of the 1612 mhz transition shows rather little variation over the entire set of observed positions ; @xmath50 lies within @xmath51 of 0.08  km  s@xmath0 for every sight - line that we observed . referring to equation ( 1 ) ,",
    "we see that the near - constancy of @xmath39 argues strongly that @xmath49 and @xmath42 are nearly constant and that @xmath42 is small compared to @xmath52  k , the smallest @xmath33 for any sight - line that we observed . in principle , of course , @xmath49 and @xmath42 could show large variations from one position to another , but it would seem highly improbable that such variations could conspire to yield a right - hand - side for equation ( 1 ) that is nearly constant .",
    "therefore , we shall henceforth assume that the oh column density and excitation are nearly the same towards each of the ten positions we have observed .",
    "it is also apparent from figure 3 that the equivalent widths of the 1665 mhz and perhaps the 1667 mhz transition appear to show a systematic decline in those sight - lines of smallest continuum brightness ; this decline allows the line excitation temperatures to be estimated . in figure 3 ( lower panel )",
    ", we plot the ratio of equivalent widths for the 1665 and 1612 mhz transitions , again as a function of the background brightness temperature .",
    "the solid curve shows the best fit to the data , for a model in which the 1612 and 1665 excitation temperatures are assumed to be constant and in the 0.1:1 ratio inferred for the ( 0,0 ) position .",
    "the best fit curve is obtained for @xmath53 . adopting this value for @xmath54 , we infer from equation ( 1 ) and the observed 1665 mhz equivalent width that the oh column density is @xmath55  @xmath29 towards the swas - observed ( 0,0 ) position .",
    "because of the relative simplicity of the chemical networks involved , diffuse molecular clouds provide a useful laboratory for testing astrochemical models ; in particular , the h@xmath3o / oh abundance ratio serves as a valuable probe of the chemical network that produces oxygen - bearing molecules ( s98 ) .",
    "one key uncertainty in that network concerns the dissociative recombination of h@xmath11o@xmath12 with electrons , and specifically the fraction of such recombinations that produce water , @xmath56 , a quantity for which two laboratory groups have obtained highly discrepant results . according to results obtained in the flowing afterglow experiment of williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , a fraction @xmath57 of dissociative recombinations of h@xmath11o@xmath12 lead to oh , a fraction @xmath58 to h@xmath3o , and the remaining fraction @xmath59 to o. a different experimental technique ( vejby - christensen et al .",
    "1997 ) , which made use of the astrid heavy - ion storage ring in denmark , yielded significantly different results ( jensen et al .",
    "2000 ) , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath60 .",
    "similar results ( although with larger error bars ) were obtained ( neau et al .",
    "2000 ) from the cryring heavy - ion storage ring facility ; they were @xmath61 ,    taken together with the ground - based observations of oh that we obtained at arecibo , the swas observations of w51 imply an h@xmath3o / oh abundance ratio @xmath4 in the diffuse cloud that is responsible for the @xmath62 feature .",
    "considering the uncertainties in our determination of the h@xmath3o and ( particularly ) the oh column densities , we estimate the h@xmath3o / oh ratio to be uncertain by a factor @xmath63 . in comparing the observed h@xmath3o / oh abundance ratio with theoretical predictions ,",
    "we have used the steady - state photodissociation region ( pdr ) model of kaufman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , modified so as to treat the case of a finite slab illuminated from two sides . because h@xmath3 and co are photodissociated following line absorption , their photodissociation rates are reduced by self - shielding . in order to treat correctly the effects of self - shielding for radiation incident upon",
    "_ both _ sides of the slab , the h@xmath3 and co abundances must be obtained by an iterative method .      in figure 4 , we show the predicted h@xmath3o and oh column densities for a variety of _ astrophysical _ parameters : the total visual extinction through the cloud , @xmath64 , in magnitudes ; the illuminating uv field , @xmath65 , in units of the habing field ; and the cosmic ray ionization rate , @xmath66 .",
    "all results apply to an assumed cloud density , @xmath67 , of 100 h nucleons per @xmath68 .",
    "the temperature is calculated from considerations of thermal balance and is @xmath69  k at the cloud center .",
    "filled squares apply to models with @xmath70 ( values suggested by the astrid storage ring experiment ) , while filled triangles apply to models with @xmath71 ( suggested by the flowing afterglow experiment ) .",
    "the different astrophysical parameters for each plotted data point are described in the figure caption .",
    "black circles represent the column densities observed toward w51 and hd 154368 .",
    "a striking feature of figure 4 is that although the h@xmath3o and oh column densities depend strongly on the assumed astrophysical parameters , their _ ratio _ is determined primarily by the assumed branching ratio @xmath56 and shows almost no dependence upon @xmath64 , @xmath65 , or @xmath66 .",
    "this behavior can be understood by means of a simple  toy \" model , in which we assume oh and h@xmath3o to be formed by dissociative recombination of h@xmath11o@xmath12 and destroyed by photodissociation .",
    "the expected h@xmath3o / oh ratio is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the assumed photodissociation rates for oh and h@xmath3o ( roberge et al .",
    "1991 ) . appears with @xmath75 in the denominator of the second term on the right - hand - side , because photodestruction of h@xmath3o results in the formation of oh . ] equation ( 2 ) yields h@xmath3o / oh abundance ratios of 0.172 and 0.049 respectively for the branching ratios assumed for the filled squares and triangles in figure 4 .",
    "these ratios are shown by dashed lines in figure 4 , and do indeed yield good agreement with results from the full steady - state pdr model .",
    "the assumption of chemical steady - state is justified by the fact that the photodissociation timescale for oh is only @xmath76 years .    given standard models for cold diffuse clouds , the observed h@xmath3o / oh abundance ratio of @xmath4 in w51 is _ consistent _ with the case @xmath77 and clearly _ inconsistent _ with the case @xmath78 .",
    "thus  if interpreted using standard models for cold diffuse clouds  the observed h@xmath3o / oh abundance ratio argues for the laboratory results obtained in the astrid storage ring experiment and against those obtained in the flowing afterglow experiment .    this conclusion , however , is different from that obtained by s98 , who used ultraviolet absorption line observations with the goddard high resolution spectrometer of hst to place an upper limit of only 0.06 ( @xmath79 ) on the h@xmath3o / oh ratio in an entirely different diffuse cloud , which lies in front of the star hd 154368 . based upon these observations , s98 argued for a _ low _ value of @xmath56 that is inconsistent with the astrid storage ring experiment . the puzzling discrepancy between the observed h@xmath3o / oh abundance ratio in these two diffuse clouds may point to the importance of additional production mechanisms for oh or h@xmath3o that do not involve the dissociative recombination of h@xmath11o@xmath12 .",
    "this possibility is addressed in  4.2 below .",
    "it has long been recognized ( e.g. elitzur & de jong 1978 ) that neutral - neutral reactions provide an alternate production route to oh and h@xmath3o .",
    "the reactions @xmath80 @xmath81 possess activation barriers that make them negligibly slow at the low temperatures typical of diffuse interstellar clouds ; at temperatures above @xmath82  k , however , they become important production mechanisms for oh and h@xmath3o ( neufeld , lepp & melnick 1995 ) . if even a small fraction of the gas in the w51 @xmath83 and/or the hd 154368 cloud were sufficiently warm  as a result of a weak shock , for example  then neutral - neutral reactions might perturb the oh and h@xmath3o column densities .    to investigate this possibility , we have obtained model predictions for pdrs in which the temperature has been fixed at a variety of temperatures between 100 and 1500  k. the results are represented by the magenta locus in figure 4 ; they were obtained for the astrophysical parameters adopted by s98 for the hd 154368 cloud  @xmath84  mag , @xmath85 , @xmath86  but for a branching ratio @xmath87 and a cosmic ray ionization rate of @xmath88 . the oh and h@xmath3o column densities are both clearly enhanced by neutral - neutral reactions . at moderate temperatures ,",
    "the h@xmath3o / oh ratio decreases because the large o / oh ratio makes reaction ( 3 ) more important than ( 4 ) . at",
    "temperatures higher than @xmath89  k , however , the effect on the ratio is reversed , and the h@xmath3o /",
    "oh ratio is _ increased _ by neutral - neutral reactions .",
    "the results obtained in enhanced - temperature models suggest a way out of the puzzle posed by the discrepant oh / h@xmath3o ratios measured in the w51 @xmath83 and hd 154368 clouds .",
    "if these clouds possess small ( but differing ) amounts of warm gas , then the oh / h@xmath3o abundance ratios could differ ( even though the value of @xmath90 must , of course , be identical in both clouds ) .",
    "we are unaware of any observations that rule out the presence of small amounts of warm gas in these sources ; indeed , the presence of such gas in diffuse clouds is predicted by certain models that seek to explain the anomalously - high ch@xmath12 abundances observed in many diffuse clouds as resulting from the effects of turbulence or weak shockso lines relative to the lines of other species ( e.g. hi ) might be an observational signature of a shock production mechanism .",
    "the velocity shifts can be very small , however , if the shock propagates at an oblique angle to the line - of - sight or if multiple shocks are present in the beam .",
    "thus , the absence of any such signature in the w51 6 km @xmath91 cloud does not argue strongly against the production of oh and h@xmath3o in shocks . ]",
    "( e.g. joulain et al .",
    "1998 , flower & pineau des forets  1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "unfortunately  as discussed above  the effect of warm gas upon the h@xmath3o / oh ratio depends critically upon the gas temperature  and even switches sign at @xmath92  k. thus , if warm gas is present , the observed h@xmath3o / oh ratio can not even be used to derive a limit upon @xmath90 .",
    "for example , if @xmath93 of the gas in hd 154368 were at @xmath94  k , then the observations of oh and h@xmath3o in that source could be reconciled with the large branching ratio @xmath87 derived in  4.1 above . alternatively ,",
    "if @xmath95 of the gas in the w51 cloud were at @xmath96  k , then the observed h@xmath3o / oh ratio would be consistent with the lower limit on @xmath90 inferred previously by s98 .    to summarize",
    ", the discrepancy between the h@xmath3o / oh ratio reported here for the w51 6 km s@xmath0 cloud and that reported previously for the hd 154368 cloud ( s98 ) suggests that a component of warm ( @xmath5 ) gas is present in one or both of these sources .",
    "the presence of this warm component makes it difficult to determine observationally the branching ratio for the dissociative recombination of h@xmath11o@xmath12 with electrons to form oh and h@xmath3o .",
    "our new observations of w51 cast doubt upon the conclusion of s98 that the branching ratio to h@xmath3o is small , but do not allow the branching ratio to be determined definitively .",
