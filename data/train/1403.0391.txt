    "graphene layers display a number of interesting properties and potential applications owing to the linearly - dispersing bands found near the @xmath0 point in the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "however , in order to get a complete characterization of graphene other regions in the brillouin zone need to be considered .",
    "in particular , unoccupied states in the vicinity of the @xmath1 point can play a significant role in the transport of currents@xcite .",
    "indeed , it is well known the importance of conduction band minima valleys located around @xmath1 in ballistic electron emission processes , where currents are injected on a substrate under voltage - dependent matching restrictions ( e.g. @xmath2-conservation@xcite ) that are relevant to design field emission transistors@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the transport of heat also involves other regions of the brillouin zone apart from the @xmath0 point .",
    "recently it has been shown how the thermal conductivity of few layers of graphene supported on silicon dioxide depend crucially on flexural modes@xcite that are sensitive to the electronic structure around @xmath1@xcite .",
    "therefore , the dielectric response of very few layers of graphene is a key physical element to effectively design devices based on graphene . the dielectric response",
    "is directly related , and therefore can be investigated , by trapping electrons in the region of unoccupied states between the fermi level and the vacuum level .",
    "these states , bound by their self - induced long - range image potential , are called image - potential states @xcite .",
    "the experimental @xcite , and theoretical @xcite study of image - potential states constitutes an ideal probe to better understand the properties of graphene layers .",
    "the image force is a non - local effect asymptotically dominated by correlation effects @xcite . in order to study the infinite rydberg series arising from the image potential",
    "one needs to compute an effective one - dimensional potential , @xmath3 , representing the real part of the quasi - static self - energy for an external probe charge .",
    "this self - induced potential is a continuous function spanning from inside the material , where it represents the exchange and correlation energy , to the vacuum region , where it should have the correct coulomb - like asymptotic behavior @xmath4 .",
    "such a potential can only be obtained from a non - local spatial formalism , since a local approach results in a correlation potential decaying exponentially in the vacuum region , following the density behavior outside the solid @xcite . for a self - consistent first - principles theory such a non - local functional dependence requires costly numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is useful and natural to search for simpler ways to obtain such an effective potential , which is the basic ingredient needed to understand the physics of image - potential states bound by an ultra - thin polarizable layer like graphene .",
    "the simplest of these alternatives is to introduce a set of fitting parameters to continuously join solutions valid either inside or outside the solid .",
    "this point of view has been taken , e.  g.  by silkin _",
    "et al . _  to study image - potential states in free - standing graphene , joining a function with the correct classical asymptotic behavior outside to a first - principles calculation inside a graphene layer @xcite .",
    "such _ ab - initio _ calculations depends on choosing a model for the exchange and correlation potential ; local density approximation ( lda ) has been employed by silkin _",
    "et al . _",
    "furthermore , it needs setting a very large unit cell to minimize effects between charged periodic images ( i.  e.   @xmath5  vacuum separator was used to reach convergence , implying a large number of plane - waves and a serious computational effort ) .",
    "finally , such a calculation needs to be supplemented by a few adjustable parameters , e.  g.  the choosing of a matching point to join the inside potential to the asymptotic classical potential . in this paper",
    "we analyze an alternative that makes use of a minimal free parameter set and makes a simple , flexible and accurate basis for interpreting experimental results .",
    "we use a well - known model for the reflection of electromagnetic fields at the surface ( infinite barrier specular model @xcite ) , coupled with a non - local static dielectric response so the desired self - energy can be obtained @xcite . for the electrodynamics model ,",
    "two free parameters are introduced , i.  e.  the electronic polarizability of the thin slab , which is determined by the fermi - thomas screening wavelength inside the slab ( electron density of the material ) , and a geometrical dimension given by the layer thickness .",
    "this approach leads in a natural way to a potential with proper physical features : it is continuous and finite over the full spatial domain and it has the right asymptotic behavior towards the vacuum region .",
    "recently , ghaznavi et al.@xcite have studied the non - linear screening of a external charge near a doped graphene layer by solving a fermi - thomas model via a non - linear integral equation .",
    "the non - linear image potential shows changes up to @xmath6 ev with respect to the classical image potential , and supports the use of rpa dielectric response for graphene . in the case of a graphene layer laying on a metallic support another free parameter",
    "may be introduced in this model : the wave - function penetration in the material .",
    "image - potential states are supported in many metallic surfaces for energies between the vacuum level and the fermi level due to the existence of surface band gaps that prevent the penetration of the wave function towards the bulk and allows the existence of bound states @xcite .",
    "therefore , penetration of wave functions is determined by the band structure of particular materials and surface orientations in a way that can not be incorporated in our model , except by including a free parameter that globally determines this penetration . here",
    "we shall first discuss two limiting cases : 0 or 100% penetration of the graphene layer , and then the continuous evolution from one limit to the other . since for image - potential states we are interested in regions in reciprocal space with @xmath7 near @xmath1 and energies between the vacuum level and the fermi energy , it is well justified to model graphene as a polarizable electron gas with a quadratic energy dispersion , as seen from the relevant bands for graphite and graphene@xcite .",
    "a connection between the interlayer states and the image potential states on graphite , graphene and other carbon - based materials has been established by different groups , e.g. silkin et al.@xcite , feng et al.@xcite , and hu et al.@xcite .",
    "these authors have pointed out that such states exist universally on two - dimensional materials .",
    "the static dielectric response , @xmath8 , has been modeled by a random phase approximation ( rpa ) , and by its small @xmath9 expansion , the fermi - thomas approximation ( ft ) @xcite .",
    "while the rpa yields a more accurate description of excitation in the material , introducing the ft allows us to write the potentials as analytic expressions or quasi - analytical ones which merely depend on a final numerical step involving the simple integration of a function decaying quickly for large values of the argument .",
    "a single parameter , the screening constant related to the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath10 , fixes both the scales for energies and lengths facilitating the rescaling of results for different materials and sizes ( atomic units are used throughout the paper , except where explicitly stated otherwise ) .",
    "taking graphite as a model ( 2 g/@xmath11 , 2s@xmath12 2p@xmath12 ) , a typical value for graphene is @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , although its precise value should depend on factors like doping , external potentials , etc ; this is accommodated in our results through the simple aforementioned scaling with @xmath15 .",
    "the other parameter used to characterize a thin slab is its width , @xmath16 . for a single atom thick layer of graphene a reasonable value for @xmath17 ,",
    "should be related to the spatial extension of @xmath18 carbon orbitals , @xmath19 a.u .",
    "the value of this parameter turns out not to be critical for this work because wave functions spread over regions much larger than @xmath17 .",
    "the theoretical results are compared to experimental results for graphene on various substrates .",
    "the presence of the substrate leads to a charge transfer from or to the graphene which can be described also as doping .",
    "the resulting work function change due to graphene has been modeled by giovanetti _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "we find a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the doping changes the available screening charge and leads in turn to a change in the energy of the image - potential states .",
    "the experimental data from two - photon photoemission agree with the calculated dependence .",
    ", of a unit test charge at different positions outside and inside a thin slab ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "the two thick vertical lines ( black ) mark the slab region .",
    "black continuous line corresponds to ft ( eqs .",

    "horizontal dashed and dotted lines show the first four eigenvalues ( red and blue for even and odd , respectively ) ; the horizontal thick line ( brown ) gives an approximate value for the work function in graphene ( @xmath27 ev ) . ]      for an external probe charge near a slab ( @xmath28 ) we seek the potential acting on @xmath29 by the polarization charges induced in the medium by @xmath29 itself .",
    "this is obtained by computing the total potential , and subtracting the charge s own naked potential . to ensure the proper boundary conditions , and according to the specular reflection model at the surface ,",
    "auxiliary pseudo - media are introduced for the polarizable slab and the vacuum that reduce the calculation to matching solutions obtained in different regions of space for homogeneous media everywhere @xcite .",
    "details of the calculation for the thin slab are given in [ slab ] .",
    "the resulting potential depends on a number of integrals that include the dielectric response of the system : for the rpa these are computed numerically . on the other hand , within the ft approximation an expression",

    "this is an useful expression that can be computed very efficiently .",
    "we shall see that for the purpose of computing the energy levels of image - potential states it makes an excellent approximation to the more costly rpa calculation .    in figure  [ fgr : lam28 ]",
    "we show the potential for a slab occupying the region @xmath35 ; both in the ft approximation ( black continuous line ) , and in the rpa one ( black dots ) . in the region",
    "determining the rydberg series ( @xmath36 ) , both approaches yield similar values and agree with the correct asymptotic power - law . near the center of the slab , ft overestimates the interaction over rpa by about 30 - 40% , @xmath37[eq : ch ] a difference that is reflected mainly in the lowest state ( node - less ) that has a significant weight in the central part of the slab where the difference between rpa and ft is larger .",
    "this state is located outside the window between the vacuum level and the fermi energy and is not part of the image - potential states series .",
    "for @xmath38 the @xmath39 integral in equations  ( [ eq : ftvi ] ) and  ( [ eq : ftvii ] ) can be evaluated analytically to obtain the following useful particular values ( see [ asymptotics ] ) : @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "we remark that the latter value corresponds to the coulomb hole @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath42 ( vacuum region ) the potential is well approximated by a classical law , @xmath43 , corrected by an image plane , @xmath44 .",
    "the value of @xmath44 can be obtained by expanding the integrals for @xmath45 , which fixes the position of the image plane in this model : @xmath23 ( dashed blue line in figure  [ fgr : lam28 ] , see [ asymptotics ] ) .",
    "finally , equation  ( 3 ) suggests a simple procedure to find a good approximant to the rpa potential .",
    "given a physically representative value for @xmath46 , one can find another value , @xmath47 , such that @xmath48 .",
    "for the purpose of obtaining energy eigenvalues of @xmath49 , @xmath50 is a good approximation to the full rpa potential that can be computed quick and easy .",
    "we solve numerically the schrdinger equation @xcite to compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions corresponding to the rpa and ft model potential described above .",
    "quite generally , bound states can be unequivocally labeled by the number of nodes @xmath51 , with energies increasing as the number of nodes increases .",

    "have been given an accompanying interpretation in the text . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     this formalism predicts , for a free - standing graphene layer , the appearance of new states associated with the even parity ( e.  g. , eigenvalues between @xmath58 and @xmath59 ev for @xmath60 , and between @xmath61 and @xmath62 ev for @xmath63 in figure  [ fgr : autoe ] ) .",
    "these new states have been obtained numerically and fit well into the classical scaling law proportional to @xmath64 for @xmath51 up to 7 .",
    "obviously , the symmetric potential can be perturbed by external ones ( e.  g. the cases of graphene on a support ) , and these states would be affected accordingly .",
    "so far we have discussed a model that effectively represents a free - standing graphene layer . for those cases where",
    "the graphene layer has been deposited on a metallic support the substrate is expected to manifest itself in two main physical ways : ( i ) the wave - functions may be constrained to be outside some spatial region where the substrate enforces an electronic gap , and ( ii ) as a consequence of the interaction between the layer and the support , some charge may be transferred to / from the slab , modifying the density of states at the fermi level , i.  e. , the value of @xmath15 .    to assess how sensitive the eigenvalues are to the penetration of wave functions into the material we have added to @xmath3 a repulsive term modeled as an exponential wall , @xmath65 .",
    "since we are only interested in creating a decaying state inside the support , we fix the parameter @xmath66 to a large value , @xmath67 a.u . ,",
    "akin to the infinite hard - wall limit ; its effective role is to expel states from the @xmath68 region , ensuring the exponential decay of wave functions inside an electronic band gap .",
    "the resulting potential for the repulsive barrier located near the slab surface ( @xmath69 a.u . , green dashed line in figure  [ fgr : lam28 ] ) is similar to the classical series with an image plane , @xmath70 , and can be easily solved by introducing a quantum defect in rydberg formula ( compare energies for the same number of nodes in the eigenfunctions for @xmath56 and whittaker series with quantum defect @xmath71 in table  [ tbl : be ] ) .",
    "the barrier , on the other hand , can be introduced below the surface , mimicking the effect of an electronic band gap due to a supporting substrate .",
    "the evolution of the first few eigenvalues with the position of the barrier have been shown in the two limits in table  [ tbl : be ] . as long as the barrier is located far away from the ultra - thin slab ( e.  g.  @xmath72 a.u . )",
    "we get values reminiscent from the original members for the unperturbed symmetrical potential . on the other limit",
    ", a barrier located just on the surface very much reminds of the classical solution . for large @xmath73",
    "the eigenvalues are determined by the potential in the vacuum region and the existence of such a barrier distorts less and less the states as they approach the vacuum level .",
    "table  [ tbl : xm ] gives the expectation mean values in  , @xmath74 , for whittaker wave functions compared with the ones obtained for the rpa or ft potentials ( e.  g.   ( [ vvacftscib ] ) ) .",
    "these values compare well with each other , which reflect the manifest similarity between wave functions commented on figure  [ fgr : autof ] , and show how the important region for the potential moves quickly away from the surface as @xmath73 grows .",
    "the fact that @xmath75 for image - potential states with @xmath76 implies that wave functions are quite insensitive to the potential inside or near the layer and they are mostly influenced by the asymptotic region where ft and rpa are equivalent .",
    "this suggests that higher @xmath9-corrections to the dielectric function arising from the random phase approximation are not very important , at least for @xmath76 states .",
    "taking away the first level , largely affected by the details near the bottom of the potential , the rest of the series is only modified by a percentage comparable to differences found in table  [ tbl : be ] between similar entries .",
    "and 3 image - potential states as a function of work function , @xmath77 ( ev ) .",
    "large open circles ( blue ) show experimental results@xcite .",
    "for ru the data@xcite are plotted by filled circles ( green ) for two different work functions : @xmath78 and @xmath79 ev .",
    "data for graphite have been taken from@xcite . ]",
    "the effect of doping may be explored by looking at the @xmath15 dependence of the energies of the image series .",
    "the important parameter of the dielectric model is the charge density of the graphene layer which can be related to the doping level and the work function .",
    "this is summarized in the current formalism via a single parameter , the fermi - thomas wave - vector @xmath15 .",
    "while @xmath15 can not be easily extracted in our formalism from doping levels of graphene , we can compare to experiments by exploiting the linear dependence predicted by this theory between the screening wave - vector and the work function of the thin slab . to compare with available experimental results it suffices to establish a connection between @xmath15 and a relevant energy scale , e.  g. the distance between the vacuum level to the fermi level , i.  e. the work function , @xmath80 .",
    "to this end , we note that within our approach the work function for a semi - infinite surface , or a slab with @xmath81  , is @xmath82 in the fermi - thomas model , and @xmath83 in the rpa one .",
    "we can see that rpa , so far our best approach , overestimates @xmath80 when compared with experimental values by about a factor @xmath84 . the linear dependence between @xmath80 and @xmath15 , on the other hand",
    ", is solidly anchored in the theory , having its origin in the net attractive interaction between the external electrons and the polarization charges created inside the polarizable material .",
    "therefore , @xmath80 should be proportional to @xmath85 , albeit the proportionality constant should be corrected to compare with the experimental value .",
    "we take @xmath86 , that corresponds to the empirical work function for graphene , @xmath87 ev . therefore , the empirical dependence @xmath77 allows us to translate @xmath15 into an experimental energy scale , and to set up an energy origin at the value @xmath88 .",
    "figure  [ fgr : enwth ] shows the results for the first three members of the series by straight lines .",
    "the experimental data will be discussed in section [ exp ] .     computed for the first three image - potential states . ]",
    "an interesting feature of this result is the fact that the higher member of the series are less and less affected by changes in @xmath15 ( @xmath80 and/or @xmath89 ) .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure  [ fgr : enwth ] where the slope of @xmath90 decreases for the higher @xmath51 values . in figure",
    "[ fgr : denrhoth ] we plot this result , and show that it is well fitted by the empirical function @xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath15 is linearly proportional to the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath89 , this gives us the empirical scaling law expected for the different terms of the image - potential - state series with doping .",
    "the theoretical results of the preceding section can be tested experimentally by two - photon photoemission ( 2ppe ) .",
    "this technique is able to measure image - potential states with high accuracy and results for various graphene - covered surfaces have been reported @xcite .",
    "photoelectron spectroscopy can also provide precise values for the work function of the surfaces which is correlated to the doping level and charge density of the graphene layer .",
    "we first discuss the work function before turning to the image - potential states .",
    "the amount of charge transfer from the substrate to the graphene layer is determined by the work function difference between substrate and graphene .",
    "this situation has been modeled with a simple capacitor model by giovanetti _",
    "et al._and validated by comparison to results from calculations for various surfaces @xcite .",
    "the curve plotted in figure  [ fgr : workfun ] shows the calculated work function of the graphene - covered surfaces versus the work function of the clean substrates for the capacitor model .",
    "the calculated values plotted by green open squares fit the curve quite well @xcite .",
    "the available experimental data are shown by blue open circles @xcite .",
    "the size of the circles represents approximately typical experimental error bars .",
    "the curve was fitted to the experimental results for the noble - metal surfaces @xcite and monolayer graphene on sic @xcite .",
    "the fit was done with the work function of graphene of 4.50  ev compared to 4.48  ev in the original work @xcite .",
    "the chemical shift was reduced from 0.90  ev to 0.89  ev .",
    "overall the fit of this work describes also the calculated values ( green open squares in figure  [ fgr : workfun ] ) very well .",
    "the surfaces included in the fit all have a graphene - metal distance around 3.4   @xcite .",
    "the surfaces of ni , ru , and pd were not included in the fit and shown by blue dashed circles .",
    "they have shorter graphene - metal distances @xcite and would require a larger chemical shift for a satisfactory description .",
    "the capacitor model provides a meaningful measure to compare different surfaces with comparable graphene - metal distances via the work function .",
    "in addition , the work function for graphene - covered surfaces can be estimated from the work function of the substrate at least for weakly coupled graphene .",
    "the charges transferred between the substrate and the graphene layer originate from the dirac cone on the graphene side",
    ". these might be electron or holes depending on the doping of the graphene .",
    "the shift of the work function due to the charge transfer can therefore be directly related to the energy of the dirac point relative to the fermi energy .",
    "zero is obtained for a work function of 4.5  ev .",
    "the values are taken from the literature @xcite and are plotted in figure  [ fgr : workfun ] as filled red circles .",
    "the agreement is perfect for sic .",
    "but for the other surfaces larger deviations are observed .",
    "one has to keep in mind that for the noble - metal substrates the graphene layer is p - doped and the dirac point can not be observed directly in photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "its energy is extrapolated from the dispersion of the dirac cone below the fermi energy .",
    "the experimental results are in good agreement with the calculations , which show the constant difference between work function and energy of dirac point as predicted by calculations @xcite .",
    "this has been found also for different modifications of graphene on sic @xcite .",
    "the important parameter of the dielectric model is the charge density of the graphene layer which can be related to the doping level and work function .",
    "the energies of the image - potential states as a function of work function have been plotted as red solid lines in figure  [ fgr : enwth ] .",
    "large open circles ( blue ) show the available experimental values @xcite .",
    "the symbol size represents typical experimental uncertainties .",
    "the data points for graphite were taken from@xcite which observed the lowest three image - potential states .",
    "other groups reported binding energies of @xmath92 ev for the @xmath93 image - potential state@xcite .",
    "the experimental values are slightly above the calculated lines , but the slope agrees fairly well",
    ". the agreement could be improved by using a smaller value for the parameter @xmath94 relating work function and fermi - thomas wave vector @xmath95 .",
    "the data point for the @xmath93 state of sic lies significantly too high .",
    "this might be an effect of different screening properties of the dielectric substrate or residual binding to the buffer layer .",
    "the accuracy and work function range of the experimental data for the noble - metal surfaces is not sufficient to determine the slope independently .",
    "therefore we only conclude that the experimental data are in reasonable agreement with the predictions of the dielectric model calculations .",
    "finally , we discuss the interpretation of experimental data measured on gr / ru @xcite .",
    "three bound states have been measured with respect to the fermi energy ( all energies in ev ) : @xmath96 ( 1 ) , @xmath97 ( 1 ) and @xmath98 ( 2 ) .",
    "the work function was measured as 4.24  ev . on the corrugated graphene on ru(0001 ) surface",
    "also lower areas exist which have a work function of 4.00  ev . on all other surfaces only the @xmath93 and @xmath99",
    "image - potential states have been found .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to check whether on ru the additional state might be the @xmath60 image - potential state .",
    "the data are plotted by green solid circles with error bars in figure  [ fgr : enwth ] for the two different values of the work function . for a work function of 4.00  ev",
    "the experimental binding energies agree reasonably well with the calculated lines . this assignment would also be compatible with the observed monotonous decrease of the lifetime with binding energy @xcite .",
    "however , we can not rule out the consistent interpretation based on different local work functions on the corrugated graphene on ru as proposed by armbrust _",
    "et al . _",
    "using standard models for the dielectric response and the reflection of electromagnetic waves at a surface we have computed the static self - energy for an ultra - thin slab mimicking a graphene layer .",
    "the self - induced potential goes continuously from the exchange and correlation energy inside the material to the classical asymptotic image potential in the vacuum . for the purpose of obtaining image - potential states",
    "binding energies we find that ft makes an excellent and convenient approximation to the accurate rpa .",
    "eigenvalues and eigenfunctions have been compared with whittaker classical series and recent experiments on gr / ir .",
    "a free standing graphene ultra - thin layer produces a spatially symmetric self - energy that induces an image potential series with even and odd states .",
    "the odd members of the series show a remarkable resemblance to the solution of schrdinger equation for the classical image potential ( whittaker wave functions ) . on the other hand ,",
    "even wave functions arise as new states that differ from whittaker in several key respects , e.  g. their non - zero density probability at the origin .",
    "while the qualitative aspects of the image series supported by a thin slab can be described in terms of quite general physical properties , the detailed quantitative values depend crucially on the penetration of wave functions into the substrate and the thin graphene film supported on it .",
    "we have considered the limiting cases of full and none penetration . for",
    "the case of films weakly interacting with a support and wave functions penetrating well inside the system some new states may consequently appear in between the classical ones , that can be traced back to the even states in a free - standing slab . in cases where the interaction is strong and",
    "the surface electronic structure prevents the penetration of wave - functions a behavior more similar to a standard metallic surface is expected .",
    "we notice that the formalism used here can be easily generalized to include the effect of surface plasmons via a frequency - dependent dielectric function @xcite .",
    "the experimental results for graphene on various substrates compare well to theoretical predictions .",
    "the measured work function change due to graphene agree with the capacitor model of giovanetti _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "this opens the possibility to predict the work function of graphene - covered surfaces from the substrate work function .",
    "the work function difference from an isolated graphene sheet is related to the doping of the graphene layer and determines in turn the available screening charge .",
    "the resulting change in the energy of the image - potential states calculated with the theoretical model is in agreement with the experimental data from two - photon photoemission .",
