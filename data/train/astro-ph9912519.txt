    "gx  1 + 4 is a unique accretion - powered pulsar in a low - mass x - ray binary system ( lmxb ) . in the 1970s the pulsar exhibited a spin - up behavior with a rate of @xmath2s / year , the hightest among all persistent x - ray pulsars , and was one of the brightest and hardest x - ray sources in the sky .",
    "after an extended low - intensity state in the early 1980s , gx  1 + 4 re - emerged in a spin - down state @xcite and has produced occasional short - term variations of @xmath3 ever since .",
    "the optical counterpart is a m5  iii giant star , v2116oph , in a rare type of symbiotic system @xcite .",
    "the identification was made secure by a rosat accurate position @xcite and by the discovery of optical pulsations consistent with the spin period of the neutron star @xcite . in 1991 , batse initiated a continuous and nearly uniform monitoring of gx  1 + 4 , confirming the spin - down trend with occasional dramatic spin - up / down torque reversal events @xcite .",
    "gx  1 + 4 has a much longer ( factor of @xmath0 100 ) spin period than the other four known lmxb accretion - powered pulsars and its orbital period has been known to be at least one order of magnitude longer than the periods of the other systems @xcite .",
    "attempts to find the orbital period by doppler shifts of the pulsar pulse timing@xcite or optical lines @xcite have both been inconclusive so far .",
    "using a small number of x - ray measurements carried out during the spin - up phase of gx  1 + 4 in the 1970s , cutler , dennis & dollan @xcite produced an ephemeris for predicting periodical enhancements in the spin - up rate of the neutron star and claimed that this could be due to an elliptical orbit with a 304-day period . here",
    "we report the discovery of a 304-day modulation in the batse frequency data and discuss its implications to the models for this source .",
    "the frequency and the pulsed flux data between julian day ( jd ) 2448376.5 and 2451138.5 ( i.e. , 1991 april 29 to 1998 october 20 ) used in this work were obtained from chakrabarty @xcite and from the batse public domain data .",
    "the 2050  kev pulsed signals are extracted from discla 1.024s channel 1 data .",
    "15-day mean values for the fluxes and pulse frequencies of gx  1 + 4 were calculated for the entire dataset .",
    "a dataset of gx  1 + 4 residual pulsation frequencies was obtained from the frequency history by subtraction of a standard cubic spline function to remove low frequency variations in the spin - down trend .",
    "the fitting points are mean frequency values calculated over suitably chosen time intervals .",
    "the results of the spline fitting are fairly insensitive to intervals greater than @xmath0 200 days between fitting points ( we have used @xmath4  days ) . the pulsed x - ray flux , frequency history and residual frequencies are shown in figure [ fig1 ] as functions of time .",
    "we have carried out a power spectrum analysis to search for periodicities of less than 1000days in both the residual frequency and the pulsed flux data .",
    "a lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite , suitable for time series with gaps , shows a significant periodic signal at 302.0  days ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) in the residual frequency time series .",
    "the power spectrum shows a red noise with an approximate power - law index index of @xmath52 . in order to estimate the statistical significance of the detection , a series of numerical simulations of the frequency time series with 1-sigma gaussian deviations",
    "were performed @xcite .",
    "the simulations show that the use of the 215-d spline , besides providing an effective filter for frequencies below @xmath6 , does not produce power in any specific frequency in the range of interest . by comparing the amplitude of our 302-day peak with the local value obtained by the mean of the numerical simulations ,",
    "we obtain a statistical significance of 99.98% for the detection .",
    "epoch folding the data using the 302-day period yields a 1-@xmath7 uncertainty of 1.7  days .    by analyzing the variation of the period of gx  1 + 4 during the spin - up phase in the 1970s , cutler , dennis & dolan @xcite proposed a 304-day orbital period and an ephemeris to predict the events of enhanced spin - up : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an integer .",
    "this ephemeris is based on four events discussed by the authors , whose existence was inferred from ad - hoc assumptions and extrapolations of the observations .",
    "the projected enhanced spin - up events derived from that ephemeris for the epochs contained in the batse dataset , represented as solid vertical lines in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , are in excellent agreement with the batse reduced spin - down and spin - up events .",
    "the batse dataset is obviously significantly more reliable than the one given by cutler , dennis & dolan @xcite since it is based on 9 well - covered events measured with the same instrument as opposed to the 4 events discussed by those authors .",
    "the striking agreement of their ephemeris with the batse observations is very conspicuous and give a very strong support to the claim that the orbital period of the system is indeed @xmath0 304 days .",
    "taking integer cycle numbers , with the @xmath10 epoch of cutler , dennis & dolan @xcite as cycle @xmath11 , and performing a linear least - squares fit to the frequency residuals seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we find that the following ephemeris can represent the time of occurrence @xmath12 of the maxima in the frequency residuals : @xmath13 , where @xmath9 is any integer .",
    "the events predicted by the above ephemeris are shown as vertical dotted lines in the three panels of fig .",
    "the value of @xmath14  days for the orbital period is consistent with the one obtained through power spectrum analysis performed on the batse data , which gives further support for the period determination .",
    "in the 1970s , when the measurements used by cutler , dennis & dolan @xcite were carried out , the source was in a spin - up extended state .",
    "they proposed that the periodic occurrence of enhanced spin - up events was due to the fact that the system was in a elliptical orbit and the periastron passages would occur when @xmath3 is maximum , as expected in standard accretion from a spherically expanding stellar wind .",
    "however , it is widely accepted today that the system has an accretion disk . since the neutron star is currently spinning - down , the radius at which the magnetosphere boundary would corotate with the disk is probably smaller than the magnetosphere radius .",
    "since the pulse period is @xmath0 120  s and the luminosity is typically @xmath15  erg / s , it can be shown @xcite that the period is probably close to the equilibrium value , for which the two radii are equal .",
    "this allows spin - down to occur even though accretion continues , the centrifugal barrier not being sufficiently effective @xcite . assuming that the elliptical orbit is the correct interpretation for the presence of the modulation , the mass accretion rate ( and hence the luminosity ) should increase as the neutron star approaches periastron .",
    "the spin - down torque then gets smaller and the neutron star decelerates at a slower rate @xcite . occasionally ,",
    "due to the highly variable mass loss rate of the red giant , the neutron star will _ spin - up _ for a brief period of time during periastron , as observed in the batse frequency curve in events 5 , 7 and 9 . according to this picture",
    ", one would expect an increase in x - ray luminosity at periastron .",
    "although this is only marginally indicated in the batse pulsed flux light curve , it should be pointed out that total flux data from the asm / rxte for the epoch mjd 50088 to 51044 does not correlate significantly with the batse pulsed flux , indicating that the pulsed flux may not be a good tracer of the accretion luminosity in this system .",
    "furthermore , the periodic @xmath16hz excursions in the residual frequency would lead to very low - significance variations in the x - ray flux measured by the asm @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation for the observed modulation would be the presence of oscillation modes in the red giant star .",
    "however , the stability of the infrared magnitudes of v2116oph @xcite preclude it from being a long - period variable , since these stars undergo regular @xmath17  1  mag variations in the infrared @xcite .",
    "we conclude by pointing out that , given the 304-day orbital period and the spectral and luminosity characteristics of v2116oph , it can be shown that the companion in this system is probably not filling its roche lobe and the accretion disk forms from the slow , dense stellar wind of the red giant @xcite .",
    "a more thorough covering of the x - ray luminosity of the system , with high sensitivity and spanning several cycles , will be very important to test the elliptical model for gx1 + 4 .",
