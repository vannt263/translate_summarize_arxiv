    "absorption lines in quasar spectra , especially the `` forest '' of ly@xmath0  lines produced by concentrations of neutral hydrogen , are uniquely suited for probing structure formation in the high - redshift universe .",
    "the absorbers trace relatively pristine baryonic material over a wide range of redshifts , densities , temperatures , and ionization states .",
    "recent advances in computer technology have expanded our ability to predict the conditions of the absorbing gas , while high - precision observations made using the hires spectrograph ( @xcite ) on the 10 m keck telescope have quantified the statistics of the low column density absorbers to unprecedented accuracy ( e.g. , hu et al . 1995 , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "these data provide stringent constraints on theories of structure formation and the state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at high redshifts .",
    "however , a detailed confrontation between theory and observations requires that simulations and observed quasar spectra be analyzed using similar techniques . in this paper",
    "we apply an automated voigt - profile fitting algorithm to ly@xmath0  spectra from a simulation of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we compare the statistics of the resulting line population to those derived by @xcite from hires spectra .",
    "recent cosmological simulations that incorporate gas dynamics , radiative cooling , and photoionization reproduce many of the observed features of quasar absorption spectra , suggesting that the ly@xmath0  forest arises as a natural consequence of hierarchical structure formation in a universe with a photoionizing uv background ( @xcite ; @xcite ; hernquist et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "most of the low column density lines are produced by structures of moderate overdensity that are far from dynamical or thermal equilibrium , blurring the traditional distinction between the ly@xmath0  forest and gunn - peterson ( 1965 ) absorption from a smooth igm .",
    "@xcite used a simple flux threshold algorithm to identify lines in their simulated spectra , defining any region with transmitted flux continuously below a specified threshold as a single line .",
    "they showed that their simulation of a cdm universe reproduced the observed abundance of absorption systems as determined by petitjean et al .",
    "( 1993 , hereafter @xcite ) quite well over most of the column density range @xmath11 , with a significant discrepancy for @xmath12 .",
    "the traditional technique for identifying and characterizing quasar absorption lines is to fit spectra by a superposition of voigt profiles .",
    "the hires spectra have very high signal - to - noise ratio and resolution , and most of the lines found in this way are weak absorbers with column densities @xmath13 .",
    "the threshold and voigt - profile procedures behave very differently in this regime , since a single feature identified by the threshold method will often be decomposed into a blend of weaker lines when it is modeled as a superposition of voigt profiles . in order to compare to published line population statistics from hires data , therefore , it is essential to analyze the simulated spectra by voigt - profile decomposition .",
    "the physical model implicit in the decomposition technique is that of a collection of discrete , compact clouds , each characterized by a single temperature ( or at least by a single velocity dispersion , which could include contributions from thermal motion and from gaussian - distributed `` turbulent '' velocities ) .",
    "the simulations undermine this physical picture because the absorbing systems merge continuously into a smoothly fluctuating background , often contain gas at a range of temperatures , and are usually broadened in frequency space by coherent velocity flows that do not resemble gaussian turbulence . nonetheless , any spectrum can be described phenomenologically by a superposition of voigt - profile lines , with the number of components increasing as the signal - to - noise ratio improves and more subtle features must be matched .",
    "the distributions of fitted column densities and @xmath6-parameters provide a useful statistical basis for comparing simulations and observations , and this is the approach that we adopt in this paper",
    ". we will discuss the correspondence between the parameters of the voigt - profile components and the physical state of the absorbing gas elsewhere ( dav et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the simulation analyzed here is the same as that of hkwm : a cdm universe with @xmath1 , @xmath14  km  s@xmath15mpc@xmath15 , baryon fraction @xmath16 , and a periodic simulation cube 22.222 comoving mpc on a side containing @xmath17 gas particles and @xmath17 dark matter particles , with individual particle masses of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the power spectrum is normalized to @xmath20 , roughly the value required to reproduce observed galaxy cluster masses ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; we will consider cobe - normalized cdm models with @xmath1 and @xmath21 in future work .",
    "we use the n - body + smoothed - particle hydrodynamics code treesph ( @xcite ) adapted for cosmological simulations ( katz , weinberg , & hernquist 1996 , hereafter @xcite ) to evolve the model from @xmath22 to @xmath4 .    instead of the @xmath23 uv background spectrum adopted by hkwm , we use the spectrum of haardt & madau ( 1996 ; hereafter @xcite ) , which is computed as a function of redshift based on the uv output of observed quasars and reprocessing by the observed ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "the spectral shape is significantly different from @xmath23 , but the uv background influences our ly@xmath0  forest results primarily through the hi photoionization rate @xmath24 , a cross - section weighted integral of the spectrum ( @xcite , equation 29 ) .",
    "the new simulation also includes star formation and feedback ( see kwh ) , but this has no noticeable effect on the ly@xmath0  forest results .",
    "a comparison between the galaxy populations of this simulation and the hkwm simulation appears in weinberg , hernquist , & katz ( 1996 ) .",
    "the mean opacity of the ly@xmath0  forest depends on the parameter combination @xmath25 .",
    "since observational determinations of @xmath26 and @xmath24 remain quite uncertain , we treat the overall intensity of the uv background as a free parameter and scale it to match the observed mean ly@xmath0  optical depth @xmath27 . when evolving the simulation , we divide hm s intensities by a factor of two , retaining their redshift history and spectral shape .",
    "we find that we must reduce the intensities by further factors of 1.28 and 1.38 at @xmath4 and @xmath3 , respectively , in order to match the estimate @xmath28 of press , rybicki , & schneider ( 1993 ; hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "although we apply this final reduction only at the analysis stage , to compute neutral fractions when generating spectra , the result is virtually identical to that of changing the intensity during dynamical evolution ( miralda - escud et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter @xcite ) . in order to match the prs",
    "mean optical depth at @xmath3 with the original hm background intensity we would need @xmath29 , closer to the value advocated by tytler , fan , & burles ( 1996 ; but see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the value of @xmath27 plays the role of a normalizing constraint , used to fix the important combination of free parameters in our igm model .",
    "once @xmath25 is set , there is no further freedom to adjust the simulation predictions , and the remaining properties of the ly@xmath0  forest provide tests of the cosmological scenario itself .",
    "we generate artificial spectra at @xmath4 and @xmath3 along 300 random lines of sight through the simulation cube , using the methods described in hkwm and cen et al .",
    "we do not consider higher redshifts here because the strong absorption leads to severe blending of lines .",
    "the wavelength spread across the box is 23.4    at @xmath4 and 35.9    at z=3 .",
    "each artificial spectrum contains 1000 pixels ; an individual pixel has a velocity width @xmath30 and a spatial extent @xmath31 comoving kpc , twice the gravitational softening length . in the ly@xmath0  forest regime ,",
    "the gas distribution is smooth on these scales .",
    "we want the analysis of our simulated spectra to closely match that used in typical observational studies , hkcsr in particular .",
    "to this end , we have developed an automated voigt - profile fitting routine , autovp , which allows us to efficiently handle large quantities of simulated data and which provides an objective algorithm that can be applied to observational data .",
    "we add noise to our simulated spectra employing a combination of gaussian photon noise with signal - to - noise ratio @xmath32 in the continuum ( corresponding roughly to the @xcite data ) and a fixed readout noise chosen to match the characteristics of the keck hires spectrograph .",
    "varying @xmath33 changes our results only at the lowest column densities . while we know the true continuum level in the simulated spectra , this is not the case for the observational data .",
    "we therefore estimate the continuum in the simulated spectra by the iterative procedure commonly used for echelle data : fitting a third - order polynomial to the data set , excluding any points lying @xmath34 below the fit , refitting the non - excluded points , and repeating until convergence is achieved .",
    "this technique is based upon the implicit assumption that the regions of lowest absorption in a high - resolution spectrum lie close to the true continuum level . because the simulated spectra show fluctuating gunn - peterson absorption that increases with @xmath35 , continuum fitting has a systematic tendency to remove flux , an average of 1.2% at @xmath4 and 5.7% at @xmath3",
    ". the effect would probably be somewhat smaller in observational data because a typical hires echelle order ( @xmath36 ) is longer than one of our simulated spectra , giving a higher probability that the spectrum contains a region of genuinely low absorption .    given a normalized , continuum - fitted spectrum and its noise vector , we apply autovp to detect lines and fit voigt profiles . in its first phase",
    ", autovp identifies lines and makes an initial estimate of their column densities and @xmath6-parameters .",
    "detection regions are identified above an 8@xmath37 confidence level , following the method of @xcite . for line identification purposes ,",
    "the data is convolved with a two - pixel - width gaussian and @xmath38 of noise is subtracted to yield a  minimum flux \" . for non - saturated regions ,",
    "a single voigt profile is placed at the lowest flux value in the detection region , and @xmath39 and @xmath6 are reduced by small increments from large initial values until the model is everywhere above the minimum flux . for saturated regions a line",
    "is placed in the middle of the trough , and @xmath39 and @xmath6 are adjusted to fit the ",
    "cusp \" regions , regions about five pixels wide on either side of the trough .",
    "the resulting first - guess line is then subtracted from the data to obtain a residual flux .",
    "detections regions are identified in the residual flux , and the procedure is repeated until there are no more @xmath40 detections .",
    "the line identification procedure is very robust , never failing for non - saturated regions and only occasionally producing a bad fit even in complex , blended , saturated regions , where @xmath39 and @xmath6 are largely degenerate and the cusp regions are difficult to identify .    in its second phase",
    ", autovp takes the initial guess and performs a simultaneous @xmath41-minimization on the parameters ( @xmath42 ) of all lines within each detection region .",
    "three independent minimization techniques are employed in conjunction in order to reliably identify the global @xmath41 minimum .",
    "autovp then tries to remove any components with a formal error in @xmath39 or @xmath6 comparable to the parameter value , refitting the detection region with one less line .",
    "if the resulting @xmath41 is lower than the original value the rejection is accepted , otherwise the fit returns to the original set of lines .",
    "autovp thus attempts to fit the spectrum with as few lines as possible while still minimizing @xmath41 .",
    "if the fit after these line rejections is  good \" ( characterized empirically by @xmath43 per pixel ) , the program ends , otherwise it tries to add a line where the local contribution to @xmath41 is greatest .",
    "the rare cases where autovp fails to find a good fit are flagged for possible manual intervention .",
    "autovp is designed to interface with the profit interactive voigt - profile fitting package ( @xcite ) .",
    "this graphical interactive fitter can be used to manually adjust poor fits , although this was required in so few cases that we base our simulation statistics entirely on the automated fits .    in figure",
    "[ fig : autovp_ex ] we show the results of autovp applied to a @xmath32 , continuum - fitted spectrum at @xmath3 .",
    "the bottom panel shows the first - guess fit superimposed on the simulated spectrum .",
    "the top panel shows the final fit after the @xmath41-minimization has been performed .",
    "generally autovp has greatest difficulty in obtaining first - guess fits in blended saturated regions like the one illustrated here .",
    "nevertheless , the minimization produced an adequate fit with no interactive adjustment .",
    "lines with @xmath44 are indicated by the long tick marks above the spectrum , while lines with @xmath45 have short tick marks .",
    "the number of these small lines identified by autovp is somewhat sensitive to the adopted @xmath33 and the detection threshold . to keep our results fairly robust against details of our fitting procedure , we exclude these lines from our analysis and only focus on lines with @xmath44 .",
    "autovp has also been applied to observational data from h1216 and mgii2796 , with results quite similar to those obtained from manual fitting .",
    "figure  [ fig : col ] shows the column density distribution @xmath46 , the number of lines per unit redshift per linear interval of @xmath47 .",
    "solid and dashed lines show the simulation results from autovp at @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the dotted line shows @xmath46 obtained using the hkwm threshold algorithm at @xmath3 , with a flux threshold of 0.7 .",
    "as expected , the two methods yield similar results at high column densities , @xmath48 , but at lower @xmath47 autovp deblends much more and finds many more lines .",
    "we find a similar trend at @xmath4 , though because of the reduced line crowding at lower redshift the agreement between the two methods extends down to @xmath49 .",
    "filled and open circles in figure  [ fig : col ] show the observational results of pwrcl and hkcsr , respectively .",
    "the two determinations of @xmath46 agree well in their regime of overlap , @xmath50 . the high @xmath33 and resolution of the hires data allow hkcsr to detect much weaker absorption features , and their @xmath46 continues to rise down to the lowest bin , @xmath51 .",
    "clearly a comparison between the simulations and hkcsr s published line statistics must be based on voigt - profile fitting , since the vast majority of their lines lie in the region where line blending causes large differences between this method and the threshold algorithm .",
    "we compute the hkcsr @xmath46 directly from their published line list , with no corrections for `` incompleteness . ''",
    "hkcsr estimate such corrections from artificial spectra _ assuming _ an underlying model of randomly distributed , voigt - profile lines with a power - law @xmath46 and a specified distribution of @xmath6-parameters , and they conclude that their results are consistent with @xmath52 down to @xmath53 , where the correction for incompleteness is a factor of four . if we applied the same correction factors to the simulation results , the derived column density distributions would also rise in a nearly power - law fashion instead of turning over at low column densities .",
    "but the simulations provide no a priori reason to expect voigt - profile lines or a power - law @xmath46 , so we prefer to compare them directly to the data without trying to correct either for lines `` lost '' to blending .",
    "the mean redshift of the hkcsr lines is @xmath54 , so the closest comparison is to the @xmath3 simulation results . to make this comparison more exact",
    ", we convolved the @xmath3 artificial spectra to a resolution @xmath55  ( @xmath56 ) before analysis , which has the minor effect of removing some lines with @xmath57 .",
    "when analyzed by voigt - profile decomposition , the simulation reproduces the large number of weak lines found in the hires spectra .",
    "in fact , the simulation overproduces the number of lines by a factor of @xmath58 in the column density range @xmath59 , a discrepancy that we will return to in  5 .",
    "the rolloff at low column densities is also somewhat different , but the results for the weakest lines are the most sensitive to the details of the fitting procedure and to the modeling of noise and spectral resolution , so we regard this difference as less significant .    in the regime where line blending is unimportant , @xmath46 of the simulations drops by a factor of @xmath9 between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . at low column densities",
    "@xmath46 actually increases because of the reduced effects of line blending . as discussed in hkwm , miralda - escud et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and @xcite , the evolution of the line population over this redshift range is driven primarily by the expansion of the universe , which lowers the physical gas densities in the absorbing systems and thereby lowers their neutral fractions and corresponding hi column densities .",
    "it is therefore more physically appropriate to think of @xmath46 as evolving to the left rather than evolving downwards , though the quantitative effect is the same to within the accuracy of this simplified account .",
    "figure  [ fig : bpar ] shows the distribution of @xmath6-parameters for lines with @xmath60 from hkcsr ( solid histogram ) and from the autovp analyses of the simulation at @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( solid and dashed curves , respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath61 cutoff eliminates lines whose identification and derived properties are sensitive to the value of @xmath33 or to details of the fitting procedure , though the results do not change qualitatively if we lower this cutoff to @xmath62 .",
    "the threshold method ( dotted curve ) yields much larger @xmath6-parameters than autovp at @xmath3 because many of its identified `` lines '' are extended absorption regions , which autovp separates into narrower components .",
    "table  [ table : bdist ] lists the median , mean , and @xmath38 dispersion of the @xmath6-parameter histograms .",
    "the @xmath3 simulation values for all three numbers are slightly larger than the hkcsr values , but the agreement is quite good given that the analysis procedures are not identical in all their details .",
    "the most significant difference in the distributions is the presence of many more narrow ( @xmath10 ) lines in the simulation than in the data , a discrepancy that we discuss further below .",
    "our most important result is that the cdm simulation reproduces the large number of weak lines found in hires spectra when it is analyzed by voigt - profile decomposition .",
    "however , in the column density range @xmath63 , the density of lines in the simulation at @xmath3 is a factor of 1.52 higher than found by hkcsr at @xmath54 .",
    "our simulation suffers from the inevitable limitation of finite numerical resolution , but the ly@xmath0  absorbers are usually large , smooth , low - overdensity structures , and we would in any case expect higher numerical resolution to increase the number of lines rather than decrease it .",
    "this excess of lines may therefore indicate a failure of the @xmath1 , @xmath20 cdm model , a tendency to produce too much small scale clumping at @xmath3 .",
    "an alternative possibility , quite plausible at present , is that we have set the intensity of the uv background too low given our adopted value of @xmath26 . as discussed in  2",
    ", we choose the background intensity in order to match the prs determination of the mean ly@xmath0  optical depth , @xmath64 at @xmath3 .",
    "the statistical uncertainties in this determination are fairly small , but there are systematic uncertainties in the required extrapolation of the quasar continuum into the ly@xmath0  forest region .",
    "we can match the hkcsr results if we increase the uv background intensity by a factor @xmath65 , thus lowering hi column densities by a similar factor and shifting the simulation result for @xmath46 to the left .",
    "this increase lowers the mean optical depth to @xmath66 , which is well outside the @xmath38 range of prs ( figure  4 ) at the hkcrs mean redshift @xmath54 but is consistent with the prs value at @xmath67 .",
    "it is somewhat _ above _",
    "the value @xmath68 found by @xcite , who use a different data set and a different method of determining the quasar continuum .",
    "the uncertainty of our conclusions highlights the need for better observational determinations of @xmath69 , which plays a crucial role in normalizing the predictions of cosmological simulations .",
    "the mean optical depth depends on the distribution of @xmath6-parameters and on the small scale clustering of absorbers in addition to the column density distribution itself , so if @xmath27 is well known then the amplitude of @xmath46 becomes an important independent test of the high - redshift structure predicted by a cosmological model .",
    "a second important result of our comparison is that the @xmath1 , @xmath20 cdm model produces ly@xmath0  forest lines with typical @xmath6-parameters close to observed values .",
    "however , the simulation yields many more lines with @xmath10 than are found by hkcsr . a thermally broadened , single - temperature gas cloud produces a ly@xmath0  absorption line of width @xmath70 .",
    "low-@xmath6 lines arise in the simulated spectra because much of the absorbing gas is at temperatures of @xmath71k or less , with its temperature determined by the balance between photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will need tests at higher resolution to check that these temperatures are not artificially low because the simulation misses entropy production in unresolved shocks , but because such shocks would have to be quite weak , we expect that the effect of missing them would be small .",
    "miralda - escud & rees ( 1994 ) pointed out that the process of reionization can heat the igm significantly if it occurs fast enough to prevent radiative cooling losses .",
    "our equilibrium treatment of photoionization ( kwh ) implicitly suppresses this effect , and since circumstantial evidence suggests that heii reionization may have occurred at @xmath72 ( @xcite ) , we could be underestimating the gas temperatures at this redshift . the dot - dash line of figure  [ fig : bpar ] shows the @xmath6-parameter distribution obtained at @xmath3 after adding 15,000 k to the temperatures of the sph particles ( a thermal energy equivalent to 4 rydbergs per heii photoelectron ) , reducing the uv background intensity by 2.46 to restore @xmath73 , then reextracting and reanalyzing spectra . heating the gas eliminates the excess of low @xmath6-parameter lines , though it worsens the agreement with @xcite at @xmath74 .",
    "we will investigate other treatments of reionization heating in future work , though the effects will be difficult to pin down because they depend on uncertain details of reionization ( @xcite ) .",
    "model predictions for @xmath6-parameters should be more robust at @xmath4 , since by this time much of the energy absorbed during heii reionization at @xmath75 will have been lost to adiabatic cooling .",
    "sharper tests of cosmological models against the statistics of the ly@xmath0  forest can be obtained by expanding the redshift range of comparisons , by improving the determination of @xmath69 , and by applying autovp to observational data , so that the analyses of simulated and observed spectra are identical in detail .",
    "we will also test models of the ly@xmath0  forest using alternative statistical measures to characterize spectra , for if the physical scenario that emerges from cosmological simulations is correct , then voigt - profile decomposition provides at best a rough guide to the density and temperature profiles of the absorbing gas . at the high @xmath33 and resolution of the hires data , an absorption feature with",
    "a single flux minimum often shows asymmetries or broad wings , requiring two or more voigt - profile lines to provide an adequate fit ( @xcite ) .",
    "pairs of lines with small velocity separations have strongly anti - correlated @xmath6-parameters , suggesting that many of these decompositions are not genuine physical blends ( @xcite ) .",
    "while results such as these can always be accommodated within a discrete `` cloud '' model by postulating just the right clustering properties , they more likely signify the breakdown of the voigt - profile paradigm itself , revealing the origin of the ly@xmath0  forest in the diffuse , undulating gas distribution of the high - redshift universe .",

    "<S> the first result is sensitive to our adopted normalization of the mean ly@xmath0  optical depth , and the second is sensitive to our assumption that helium reionization has not significantly raised gas temperatures at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore too early to say whether these discrepancies indicate a fundamental problem with the high - redshift structure of the @xmath1 cdm model or reflect errors of detail in our modeling of the gas distribution or the observational procedures . </S>"
