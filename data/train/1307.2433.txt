    "these values correspond to switching voltages @xmath173v in our hybrid concept , which are experimentally accessible [ cf .",
    "[ fig : switching](d ) ] .    to furthermore lower the switching strain @xmath106 , the properties of the ferromagnetic film itself must be fine - tuned , as @xmath106 linearly depends on the cubic anisotropy constant @xmath33 and inversely depends on the magnetostriction constants @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "most promising candidates regarding the realization of a magnetization switching therefore evidently are materials with a small cubic anisotropy and high magnetostriction constants .",
    "in summary , we have investigated concepts for a voltage - controlled , nonvolatile @xmath174 switching of the remanent magnetization in @xmath1 thin film / piezoelectric actuator hybrids at room temperature .",
    "the possibility to induce strain along different directions in the film plane with respect to the crystallographic axes depending on the cementing procedure , allows to investigate the switching behavior and particularly to take advantage of the magnetostriction constants @xmath175 along different crystalline orientations .",
    "we have discussed the qualitatively different switching behavior for two different configurations , namely strain exerted along the in - plane crystalline @xmath1 @xmath11 and along the in - plane @xmath58 directions .",
    "the free energy density of the ferromagnetic thin films was determined by fmr spectroscopy , which allows to infer the equilibrium magnetization orientation in a stoner - wohlfarth model .",
    "the results show a rotation of the easy axes by a few degrees and a significant modification of the relative strength of the easy axes , respectively . however , in combination with squid magnetometry measurements we find that the angle of magnetization reorientation is not large enough to induce a magnetization switching in the former , and magnetic domain formation impedes a coherent magnetization switching in the latter approach .",
    "this shows that inefficient strain transfer and magnetic domain formation are major obstacles towards a non - volatile strain - controlled magnetization switching . using the experimental free energy and strain transfer parameters",
    ", we find in simulations that skillful alignment of the strain within the films should reduce the strain values required to switch the magnetization and impede domain formation . more explicitly , our experiments suggest that an all - voltage - controlled , nonvolatile magnetization switching at room temperature and zero magnetic field should be possible .      46 natexlab#1#1[2]#2 , , ( ) .",
