    "we investigate a method to measure galaxy redshift distributions using angular cross - correlations with an overlapping spectroscopic sample .",
    "we outline the approach as follows .",
    "consider two galaxy datasets : a spectroscopic sample with a known redshift distribution , and a photometric sample with an unknown redshift distribution .",
    "the samples overlap on the sky and in redshift .",
    "since they are sampled from the same underlying density field , we expect that they will share a positive cross - correlation function regardless of galaxy attributes such as colour and luminosity",
    ". the amplitude of the angular cross - correlation will increase with the degree of overlap of the two samples .",
    "therefore , the redshift distribution of the photometric sample can be mapped out by dividing the spectroscopic sample into adjacent redshift bins , and for each bin measuring the angular cross - correlation with the photometric sample . in this work",
    "we use this technique to constrain the redshift distribution of galaxies in tomographic bins within the kilo - degree survey ( kids ) using the spectroscopic 2-degree field lensing survey ( 2dflens , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to trace the surrounding large - scale structure .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "uncertainty and bias in the source redshift distribution directly propagates to derived cosmological constraints as one of the most important astrophysical systematics .",
    "the required level of systematic error control increases in severity for future surveys : for `` stage iv '' dark energy experiments @xcite such as the large synoptic sky telescope ( lsst ) and _ euclid _ , in order to avoid a degradation of dark energy constraints by more than @xmath1 , the mean and standard deviation of the photometric redshift distribution need to be measured to an accuracy @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "many approaches have been proposed for determining source redshift distributions .",
    "we define _ direct calibration _ methods as those that calibrate a mapping from the flux in photometric bands to a galaxy s redshift .",
    "template - based approaches and machine learning algorithms both lie in this category , but there are various factors that make the above level of accuracy difficult to obtain , including catastrophic photometric errors , completeness requirements for spectroscopic training samples , and sample variance @xcite .",
    "we will discuss these factors in the subsequent section .",
    "an alternative ` indirect calibration ' approach , which we pursue in this study , is provided by cross - correlation methods . in particular , we focus on the extension and application of the _ optimal quadratic estimation _ method proposed by @xcite ( henceforth , ) , testing this method using both simulations and data .",

    "the key point of distinction between direct and indirect calibration approaches is that the former requires spectroscopic redshifts for a subsample of the full photometric sample , and this subsample needs to be representative of the full sample in both colour and magnitude space @xcite .",
    "this requires that the targetted spectroscopic sample should be highly complete , i.e. , a secure redshift needs to be measured for @xmath4 of the subsample @xcite . to achieve this level of completeness",
    ", spectroscopic redshifts are required for faint and high - redshift galaxies that are abundant in deep imaging surveys .",
    "in contrast , for a cross - correlation analysis one is free to target any tracer of overlapping large - scale structure ( most usefully , the brightest galaxies ) , circumventing this difficulty .",
    "achieving a high level of spectroscopic - redshift completeness for direct calibration methods presents a significant observational challenge , as the chance of obtaining a successful redshift is dependent on an object s magnitude .",
    "therefore , spectra are typically obtained for a non - random subsample of the target catalogue .",
    "a useful example is the deep2 survey conducted on the deimos spectrograph at keck observatory : for the highest redshift quality class , secure redshifts were only obtained for @xmath5 of the galaxies @xcite .",
    "considering future surveys , the severity of this problem is demonstrated by the requirement for spectroscopic follow - up suggested by @xcite : obtaining @xmath4 redshift completeness at @xmath6 ( lsst depth ) would require more than 100 nights on keck .",
    "we note that the requirements for spectroscopic follow - up can be reduced by assigning weights to galaxies during the training phase of photometric - redshift calibration @xcite .",
    "these weights are assigned based on the colour - magnitude phase - space distribution of both the parent photo-@xmath3 sample and the follow - up spectroscopic sample .",
    "the result is that the weighted spec-@xmath3 sample more closely matches the photo-@xmath3 sample in colour - magnitude space .",
    "the extent to which this approach allows one to reduce the required completeness is currently a subject of study .",
    "the above challenges are also relevant for machine learning algorithms , as they require separate training , testing and validation samples .",
    "similar requirements exist for template - based approaches , where  even though templates can be derived synthetically in principle  assessing the resulting accuracy of the photo-@xmath3 estimate requires a representative spec-@xmath3 sample , which can also aid in the construction of accurate spectral templates .",
    "moreover , deriving a bayesian prior used in the fitting process ( e.g. , bpz * ? ? ?",
    "* ) requires a spec-@xmath3 sample ; this prior can strongly influence the final results @xcite .    _",
    "catastrophic errors _ , photo-@xmath3 estimates @xmath7 with @xmath8 , present an additional issue for direct calibration methods .",
    "such errors occur because , with only broad - band flux information , there exist degeneracies in galaxy colours such as the confusion between the lyman and balmer breaks .",
    "general studies of the consequences of catastrophic errors are presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these outliers can not be mitigated by re - weighting the sample .",
    "although photo-@xmath3 calibration by cross - correlation avoids some of the issues listed above , there remain significant challenges for this approach , some of which we outline below .    * * degeneracy with galaxy bias * : cross - correlations measure the combination @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the source galaxy bias factor and @xmath11 is the source redshift probability distribution",
    ". therefore , galaxy bias is degenerate with the redshift distribution @xcite . calibrating the redshift - dependent galaxy bias",
    "requires extra probes ( e.g. , galaxy - galaxy lensing ) or assumptions ( e.g. , the bias varies smoothly with redshift ) .",
    "this likely represents the dominant issue when constraining the source redshift distribution using cross - correlations . * * cosmological dependence * : the model cross - correlation function depends on both our guess of @xmath11 and the cosmological model .",
    "this introduces a worrying circularity , as our aim is to test the cosmological model with measurements derived using @xmath11 . * * extra source of correlations * : cosmic magnification introduces additional correlations and hence can bias measurements of the redshift distribution .",
    "in addition to changing the shape of galaxies , lensing changes their size and brightness , promoting fainter galaxies into a magnitude - limited survey and correlating foreground and background objects @xcite . * * spec-@xmath3 coverage * : the redshift range over which the source distribution can be reconstructed is limited by the redshift and areal coverage of the spectroscopic cross - correlation samples .      in this section",
    "we summarize recent work on photometric calibration with angular cross - correlations .",
    "* * estimators : * a number of estimators have been proposed for inferring the redshift distribution of a photometric sample using an overlapping spec-@xmath3 sample @xcite .",
