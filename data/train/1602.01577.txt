    "-coupled low - density parity - check ( sc - ldpc ) codes have attracted many attentions in recent years due to their ability to achieve the shannon limit of binary memoryless symmetric ( bms ) channels under iterative decoding @xcite .",
    "the research on the sc - ldpc codes was started with the advent of convolutional ldpc codes by felstrom and zigangirov @xcite .",
    "there have been lots of research results on construction and analysis of the convolutional ldpc codes @xcite@xcite . especially , sridharan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite derived the belief propagation ( bp ) threshold which is a theoretical performance limit of the iterative decoding for the convolutional ldpc codes and lentmaier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite empirically showed that the bp thresholds of convolutional ldpc codes are close to the map thresholds of the underlying regular block ldpc codes .",
    "this remarkable improvement of the bp thresholds was named as _ threshold saturation _ which was analytically proved in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , proving the threshold saturation effect has been done through many different approaches such as a potential function @xcite , @xcite and an one - dimensional continuous coupled system @xcite .",
    "these approaches utilize the unique decoding process of sc - ldpc codes ; the reliable messages are propagated from the both ends to the center on the tanner graph in a _ wave - like manner_.    sc - ldpc codes are constructed by coupling @xmath0 disjoint ldpc codes with the boundary condition which causes the wave - like propagation . however , at the cost of the wave - like propagation , the boundary condition reduces the overall code rate compared with that of underlying codes , where the rate loss converges to zero at a speed @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we can obtain a capacity approaching code ensemble for large chain length because the rate loss is vanished while the wave - like decoding process is still successful even for extremely large chain lengths , provided that the iteration number increases with the chain length . in a practical situation , however",
    ", sc - ldpc codes with too large @xmath0 imply a large number of iterations for the wave - like propagation in the bp decoding @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an in - depth analysis regarding a scaling law of sc - ldpc ensembles shows that large @xmath0 is not good for the finite - length performance @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , sc - ldpc ensembles with short @xmath0 have good decoding properties such as high bp thresholds , low required numbers of iterations for the wave - like propagation , and good finite - length performances but it show large rate loss .    some modifications of sc - ldpc ensembles have been studied to achieve performance improvement in practical situations . among them , we focus on the modification by properly connecting multiple sc - ldpc ensembles .",
    "the idea of coupling is not limited to connection of several ldpc ensembles into a chain ( an sc - ldpc ensemble ) but also extended to connection of several chains to overcome some problems that a single chain can not solve .",
    "for example , the multi - dimensional sc - ldpc codes @xcite were considered for their robustness against burst erasures and the parallelly connected sc - ldpc chains @xcite were proposed to obtain asymptotically good code ensembles with wide rate range .",
    "especially , in @xcite@xcite , a loop ensemble obtained by connecting two sc - ldpc chains was proposed with improved bp thresholds and finite - length performances . at the connecting points in the loop ensemble ,",
    "consecutive positions consisting of high degree variable nodes , so called protected region , are created and reliable messages are emitted from the protected region . due to these reliable messages ,",
    "the loop ensemble is decoded as two independent sc - ldpc chains with short chain length and achieves performance improvements .",
    "however , in @xcite , it is shown that the loop ensemble shows worse finite - length performance than the sc - ldpc ensemble for long chain length .",
    "the proposed coupled ensemble , called overlapped circular sc - ldpc ( oc - ldpc ) ensemble , is obtained based on the idea to connect multiple chains , but it is different from the loop ensemble in the sense that the oc - ldpc ensemble is constructed from two circular sc - ldpc ensembles rather than two sc - ldpc ensembles . since there is no reliable position initiating decoding waves in the symmetric structure of the circular sc - ldpc ensemble @xcite , the performance improvement by coupling does not appear in the circular sc - ldpc ensemble . to make a protected region from which decoding waves start to propagate in the circular ensemble ,",
    "our proposed approach is overlapping some variable nodes in two circular sc - ldpc ensembles , which introduces high - degree variable nodes . since high - degree variable nodes in ldpc codes",
    "are successfully decoded with high probability , a protected region is formed by the introduced high - degree variable nodes like the loop ensemble .",
    "similar to the loop ensemble , the oc - ldpc ensemble behaves as two _ split _ short sc - ldpc chains which are separately decoded with improved decoding performance and small number of iterations in the decoding process . since the performance improvement of the loop and oc - ldpc ensembles comes from almost the same effect , these ensembles look similar .",
    "however , in terms of degree distribution of the protected region , we will show that the protected region of the oc - ldpc ensemble is more protected compared to the protected region of the loop ensemble , and thus the oc - ldpc ensemble behaves as two split short sc - ldpc chains regardless of the chain length unlike the loop ensemble .",
    "contrary to the randomly defined ensemble , codes from protograph - based ensembles @xcite are well suited for designing practical codes with several advantages such as good finite - length performance and an implementation - friendly structure .",
    "also , protograph - based sc - ldpc ensembles have good minimum distance properties as well as capacity approaching bp thresholds @xcite .",
    "thus , we design finite - length oc - ldpc codes based on protograph and numerical results show that the proposed codes provide better finite - length performance than the conventional sc - ldpc codes for both short and long chain lengths .",
    "furthermore , it is also verified that a construction method called precoding @xcite is applicable to the proposed ensemble to further improve the performance .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : construction ] gives construction methods of coupled ensembles such as sc - ldpc , loop , and oc - ldpc ensembles . in section [ sec : analysis ] , the behavior of the oc - ldpc ensemble in the decoding process is analyzed by the density evolution ( de ) and the expected graph evolution . in section",
    "[ sec : protograph ] , the protograph - based ensembles for the proposed coupled ensembles are presented .",
    "finally , the conclusion is given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "we consider the sc - ldpc ensemble in @xcite denoted by the @xmath4 ensemble , where @xmath0 and @xmath5 are called the chain length and the coupling length , respectively .",

    "then the connectivity matrix @xmath20 of the @xmath4 ensemble is represented as @xmath21_{u , v}=\\begin{cases }   1 \\textrm { , if $ u\\in [ v , v+w-1]$ } & \\\\ 0 \\textrm { , otherwise }   \\end{cases}\\label{eq : t_sc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the total number of variable nodes @xmath24 and check nodes @xmath25 in the graph are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "however , some check nodes at the leftmost @xmath28 and rightmost @xmath28 boundary positions can not be connected to any variable node in the ensemble by the randomness of the connectivity .",
    "the expected number of check nodes @xmath29 with at least one connection to the variable nodes in the graph is @xcite @xmath30 which is less than @xmath31 .",

    "* lemma 3 ) @xmath35 where the first term is the design rate of the underlying regular ldpc ensemble , the second term represents the rate loss by coupling , and the third term represents the rate gain by the unconnected check nodes .",
    "since the third term is small in comparison with the second term , the design rate of the sc - ldpc ensemble is reduced from the first term , but it converges to the first term as @xmath0 increases .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the loop ensemble @xcite@xcite .",
