    "chiral symmetry and topology are tightly related with each other in the gauge field theory through the quantum correction .",
    "namely , the axial anomaly appears at the one - loop level , and its integral over space - time leads to the topological charge of the background gauge field . in principle , one should be able to analyze the implication of this relation for physical observables , such as the neutron electric dipole moment , using the lattice gauge theory , which provides a rigorous formulation of the non - abelian gauge theories even in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "such study is very difficult with the wilson - type dirac operator , since the chiral symmetry is explicitly violated on the lattice .",
    "the overlap - dirac operator @xcite @xmath0 ,    \\;\\;\\ ;    \\bar{a } = \\frac{a}{1+s},\\ ] ] realizes the exact chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing @xmath1 @xcite satisfying the ginsparg - wilson relation @xcite @xmath2 it is constructed from the wilson - dirac operator @xmath3 with the wilson parameter @xmath4 ; the hermitian wilson - dirac operator @xmath5 enters as an argument of the sign function @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 in ( [ eq : ov ] ) is a fixed number in the region @xmath8 .",
    "since the definition ( [ eq : ov ] ) contains a non - smooth function , the locality of the dirac operator could be lost when there are near - zero eigenvalues of @xmath9 .",
    "this is consistent with the index theorem , because the index of the dirac operator , which may be considered as a definition of the topological charge , is a non - smooth function of the background gauge field .",
    "when the topological charge changes the value , the dirac operator must become ill - defined , and this is exactly the point where @xmath10 has a zero eigenvalue .",
    "the locality of the overlap - dirac operator ( [ eq : ov ] ) is guaranteed for the gauge fields on which the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath9 is bounded from below by a positive ( non - zero ) constant @xcite .",
    "this condition is proved to be satisfied if the gauge field configuration is smooth and each plaquette is close enough to one ; @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the plaquette variable at @xmath13 on the @xmath14-@xmath15 plane , and @xmath16 denotes the norm of the operator . in the four - dimensional case ,",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is a sufficient ( but not a necessary ) condition @xcite .",
    "this is called the `` admissibility '' bound .",
    "one can construct a gauge action , which generates gauge configurations respecting the condition ( [ eq : admi ] ) .",
    "for instance , lscher proposed the action @xcite @xmath18 which has the same continuum limit as the standard wilson gauge action does .",
    "in fact , the limit @xmath19 corresponds to the standard wilson gauge action .",
    "unfortunately , the bound @xmath17 is too tight to produce gauge field ensembles corresponding to the lattice spacing around 0.1  fm ; for practical purposes , one must choose much larger values of @xmath20 .",
    "an interesting question is , then , whether the action can keep the good properties for @xmath20 significantly larger than @xmath21 . to be explicit",
    ", one expects that ( i ) the topology change during the molecular - dynamics - type simulation is suppressed , and ( ii ) the appearance of the near - zero eigenvalue of @xmath9 is suppressed , compared to the standard wilson gauge action . the point ( i ) is important in order to efficiently generate gauge configurations with large topological charge , which is necessary for the study of the @xmath20-regime or the @xmath22-vacuum . with the point ( ii ) , the locality of the overlap - dirac operator is improved , and the numerical cost to apply the overlap - dirac operator is reduced . in the numerical application to the massive schwinger model with @xmath23 , the stability of the topological charge and the improvement of the chiral symmetry with the domain - wall fermion were observed @xcite .",
    "also , in the four - dimensional quenched qcd , good stability of the topological charge has been reported @xcite .    for gauge actions to be useful in practical simulations ,",
    "good scaling property toward the continuum limit is required .",
    "the action ( [ eq : admiaction ] ) differs from the standard wilson gauge action only at @xmath24 , and we expect that it approaches to the continuum limit as quickly as the standard action does",
    ". the scaling would be better for the improved gauge actions , such as the lscher - weisz @xcite , iwasaki @xcite or dbw2 @xcite gauge actions , but an advantage of ( [ eq : admiaction ] ) is that it contains a parameter which directly controls the admissibility bound and thus the appearance of the low - lying modes of @xmath10 . for the improved actions including the rectangle loop , on the other hand , the low - lying modes are suppressed for large values of the rectangle coupling ( _ e.g. _ with the dbw2 action ) at the price of loosing the good scaling for short distance",
    "quantities @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to give a systematic quenched qcd study of the topology conserving gauge action .",
    "we find that the topology change is indeed suppressed when the parameter @xmath20 is of order one .",
    "we also find that the scaling violation in the static quark potential remain reasonably small and the tadpole improved perturbation theory for the renormalized gauge coupling shows a good convergence in the parameter range of our study .",
    "therefore , the topology conserving gauge action has a desired properties for a practical application . here",
    "we would like to comment on the possible application for the future work with the dynamical overlap fermion . in the standard method , with the wilson plaquette action , one projects out the smallest eigenmodes of @xmath25 at every molecular dynamics step in the simulation trajectory and judge if the topology change occurs or not .",
    "when the topology change occurs , one recalculates the link updation with much higher accuracy on the topology crossing point to choose either entering the new sector ( refraction ) or going back to the previous sector ( reflection )  @xcite .",
    "if one omits this step it would make the acceptance very low due to the non - smoothness of the determinant as a functional of the gauge configuration . on the other hand ,",
    "if one uses the topology conserving action , crossing @xmath26 can be strongly suppressed , so that one can avoid the cpu time consuming reflection / refraction method . in this sense",
    ", the use of the topology conserving gauge action can also be useful in full qcd simulations with the overlap fermions .",
    "combination with the stout link version of the overlap fermion  @xcite would be interesting as well .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after describing the simulation methods in section  [ sec : simulation ] , we show the fundamental scaling studies in section  [ sec : scaling ] , that is the determination of the lattice spacing and a scaling test with the static quark potential .",
    "renormalization of the coupling constant with the action ( [ eq : admiaction ] ) can be estimated using perturbation theory as described in section  [ sec : pert ] .",
    "section  [ sec : qstab ] is the main part of this paper ; we report how much the topology change may occur with different choices of parameters . in section  [ sec : overlap ] the locality and the numerical costs of the overlap fermion with gauge fields satisfying the bound ( [ eq : admi ] ) are discussed . conclusion and outlook are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "although several types of the gauge action that generate the `` admissible '' gauge fields satisfying the bound ( [ eq : admi ] ) are proposed @xcite , we take the simplest choice ( [ eq : admiaction ] ) .",
    "we study three values of @xmath27 : 1 , 2/3 , and 0 .",
    "note that @xmath28 corresponds to the conventional wilson gauge action .",
    "the value @xmath29 is the boundary , below this value the gauge links can take any value in the gauge group @xmath30 and the positivity is guaranteed @xcite .",
    "the link variables are generated with the standard hybrid monte carlo algorithm @xcite .",
    "we take the molecular dynamics step size @xmath31 in the range 0.010.02 and the number of steps in an unit trajectory @xmath32 = 2040 . during the molecular dynamics steps",
    "we monitor that the condition @xmath33 is always satisfied with our choice of the step size .",
    "we discarded at least 2000 trajectories for thermalization before measuring observables .    in order to measure the topological charge ,",
    "we develop a new type of cooling method .",
    "it consists of the hybrid monte carlo simulation with an exponentially increasing @xmath34 value @xmath35 and decreasing step size @xmath36 as a function of trajectory @xmath37 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath38 with a fixed @xmath39 .",
    "note that @xmath40 is fixed so that the evolution at each step is kept small .",
    "this method allows us to `` cool '' the configuration smoothly , keeping the admissibility bound ( [ eq : admi ] ) with @xmath41 . for the parameters , we take @xmath42 = ( 2.0 , 0.01 , 1 ) for the configurations generated with @xmath43 , and ( 3.5 , 0.01 , 2/3 ) for the configurations with @xmath44 or @xmath28 . even for the gauge configuration generated with the standard gauge action ( @xmath28 )",
    ", the condition @xmath45 can be used because it allows all values of su(3 ) .",
    "after 50200 steps , the link variables are cooled down close to a classical solution in each topological sector .",
    "in fact , the geometrical definition of the topological charge @xcite @xmath46 of these `` cooled '' configurations gives numbers close to an integer times a universal factor @xmath47 .",
