    "red giants in globular clusters are known to have low initial masses of about 1  m@xmath4 considering their high ages of 1013  gyr .",
    "observations revealed that some of the red giants have the mass loss accompanied with dust formation ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "circumstellar dust has been detected in on - going space missions ( _ spitzer space telescope _ , sst , boyer  , , @xcite ; akari , @xcite ) .",
    "terminal velocities of the stellar winds from red giants , 1015 km  s@xmath6 @xcite , are lower than typical escape velocities from massive globular clusters , @xmath7  30  km  s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "for this reason , one would expect that the released materials are trapped and accumulated within clusters in the halo region . on the other hand ,",
    "the intracluster matter is removed by ram pressure when clusters cross the galactic plane .",
    "it was expected that gas of the order of 10  @xmath8 exists in a cluster depending on its size and the time since the last passage through the galactic plane @xcite .    in spite of the early expectations , most previous attempts failed to detect intracluster matter and placed upper limits which were lower than the expected amounts .",
    "the surveys range from the ones of dust to those of different forms of gas ( dust , @xcite ; molecular gas , @xcite ; atomic gas , @xcite ; ionized gas , @xcite ; and references therein ) . among the challenges to search for intracluster dust",
    ", the most secure detection was found in the globular cluster m  15 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite confirmed the extended emission of the intracluster dust , which they named ir1a , with sst .",
    "they also obtained its temperature ( @xmath9k ) and dust mass ( @xmath10  m@xmath4 ) based on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the temperature was found to be higher than that of the interstellar dust ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the obtained mass is still 4 times smaller than the expected mass released via the mass loss of red giants .",
    "intracluster gas has been also detected in a couple of cases ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the deficiency of the intracluster dust suggests that some mechanism(s ) are at work to remove or destroy the dust even in the halo region .",
    "the discrepancy between the expected amount of the released dust and the upper limit is larger than ten for some clusters whose intracluster dust has not been detected @xcite .",
    "it remains to be understood what mechanism(s ) are efficient to what extent .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed sputtering of dust grains by hot halo gas to explain the deficiency . on the other hand , hopwood  ( , ) rejected the sputtering as the mechanism responsible for the removal of the intracluster dust .",
    "@xcite presented a list of possible mechanisms .",
    "very recently , @xcite demonstrated that stellar collisions can generate the kinetic energy to remove the intracluster dust and gas .",
    "the fate of the released matter within the clusters may have an effect on evolution of globular clusters .",
    "although it was once considered that stars in a globular cluster are chemically homogeneous , more and more studies revealed evidence of inhomogeneity .",
    "readers are referred to @xcite , for example , for early investigations mainly about carbon and nitrogen abundances .",
    "recently , the existence of stars enriched in helium have attracted a lot of attention ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "many authors have argued that those enrichment results from the matter released from intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that low - mass agb stars can also play an important role in generating stars with enriched helium contents via intracluster - matter accretion .",
    "however , it is not well studied whether the ejecta of agb stars are actually retained within clusters in the context of dynamics of intracluster gas and dust",
    ". the ejecta may disappear before they are used for the generation of enriched stars .",
    "the connection to such evolutionary scenarios strengthens the importance to understand how the intracluster matter decreases faster than expected if it is true .    the far - infrared surveyor ( fis ; @xcite ) on - board akari satellite @xcite provides us with a new opportunity to investigate the intracluster dust .",
    "the fis can take much deeper images in the far infrared with much higher angular resolution than before .",
    "observations in the far infrared have high sensitivities for the cold dust , @xmath730  k. we used the fis to observe a dozen of globular clusters as a part of the mission program to investigate the mass - loss phenomenon in evolved stars in globular clusters and nearby dwarf galaxies ( agbga ; pi , y. nakada ) .",
    "we describe the observation and data reduction in section [ sec : observation ] .",
    "as we will present , we detect a few extended emissions and several point - like sources .",
    "analyses of the extended emissions and the point - like sources are presented in section [ sec : diffuse ] and [ sec : points ] , respectively .",
    "we argue that most of them are not associated with the clusters , while one point - like source remains to be a candidate of the dust within the cluster ( section [ sec : candidate ] ) . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we present discussions on the mass of the intracluster dust ( for both the possible detection and upper limits ) and discuss the impact on evolution of globular clusters .",

    "[ fig : mdust ] , we plot the estimated upper limits of the intracluster dust against some parameters of the clusters which are taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we used the harris catalog available online which was updated in 2003 .",
    "we also include the mass of the intracluster - dust candidate , n5024 fis2 ( see section [ sec : n5024fis2 ] ) , and those of the dust clouds in m  15 and ngc  6356 reported in previous studies .",
    "no parameter can be an exclusive factor to determine the accumulated mass of the intracluster dust .",
    "although @xcite suggested that the metallicity may be an influencing factor based on the fewer samples with shallower observations , the detection of m  15 ir1a disclaims such possibility .",
    "it is unclear what parameter(s ) determine the amount of the accumulated intracluster dust .",
    "( 70mm,105mm)fig11.ps",
    "the estimated dust mass of m  15 ira1 is @xmath14  m@xmath4 , much larger than the upper limits in table [ tab : limits ] .",
    "@xcite used a box aperture of @xmath15 , which is larger than a circle with @xmath16 . nonetheless , the size of the far - infrared emission of the detected intracluster dust , ir1a , is smaller than the circle so that we can make a direct comparison of the values for ir1a with the upper limits obtained in this work .",
    "it is clear that the intracluster dust in m  15 , which is still smaller than the estimated mass released from red giants @xcite , is exceptionally large compared with possible intracluster dust in other globular clusters if any .",
    "the parameters such as @xmath17 and @xmath18-height for at least some of our samples are comparable with those of m  15 .      here",
    "we discuss the lack of intracluster dust quantitatively by estimating the lifetime from the expected amount of gas released from red giants .",
    "we can calculate the gas amount corresponding to that of the intracluster dust with the dust - to - gas mass ratio @xmath19 .",
    "the ratio is considered to be dependent on metallicity .",
    "@xcite concluded that @xmath19 is proportional to the metallicity by comparing oh / ir stars in the solar neighborhood and the large magellanic cloud ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "it is worthwhile noting uncertainties on @xmath19 especially in the low - metallicity environment .",
    "@xcite found the proportionality between @xmath19 and metallicity based on the objects between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "it is not clear if the extrapolation can be applied below [ fe / h ]  @xmath22  dex .",
    "@xcite found more than 20 stars with dusty wind in m15 .",

    "if @xmath19 is not so small as expected from the proportionality , the amount of gas corresponding to the upper limits of dust gets smaller .",

    "it is possible to evaluate the number of mass - losing stars in a cluster by using the specific evolutionary flux , @xmath24 which is the number of stars entering or leaving any post - main - sequence stage per year and per solar luminosity of the stellar population @xcite .",
    "the average dust mass released per year within a cluster can be obtained as , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the amount of dust to be lost during the post - main - sequence stage and @xmath27 is the total luminosity of the cluster .",
    "we assume that each red giant in a cluster loses the gas of 0.2  m@xmath4 , then @xmath26 is calculated as @xmath28  m@xmath4 @xmath29}}}$ ]  m@xmath4 .",
    "we obtain the upper limits of the lifetime of the intracluster dust : @xmath30 @xmath27 is divided by two because the upper limit @xmath31 has been obtained for the intracluster dust within the half - mass radius .",
    "this factor may not be correct if the dust released from stars outside the half - mass radius falls into the central region of the cluster , in which case the estimated lifetime @xmath32 gets even smaller .",
    "we list the obtained lifetimes in table [ tab : limits ] .",
    "two values are obtained based on the assumed dust temperatures of 35  k and 70  k. the value with @xmath33  k is 11 times larger than the one with @xmath5  k from the ratio of planck function . in both cases ,",
    "they are significantly shorter than the typical time interval , @xmath34  yr , between passages through the galactic plane for most of the clusters",
    ". please note that the @xmath35 gets even smaller if @xmath19 is larger than the value expected from the proportionality between @xmath19 and [ fe / h ] .",
    "the kinematics information of the clusters suggests that most of the clusters have actually spent a significant time as large as @xmath36  yr since the last passage .",
    "here we consider the orbits obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the velocity components perpendicular to the galactic plane , i.e. @xmath37 listed in table [ tab : limits ] , indicate that five clusters are now approaching to the plane . for ngc  1904 and 5139",
    ", @xmath37 almost equals to zero , so that they are in the middle of the passage through the galactic plane .",
    "time since the most recent passages is about the half of the orbital periods or longer for these seven clusters .",
    "ngc  1851 and 6341 are still moving away from the plane .",
    "ngc  1851 is well separated from the plane by 6.9  kpc .",
    "the obtained lifetime , @xmath38  myr , is certainly shorter than the time since its last passage .",
    "for ngc  6341 , on the other hand , the discrepancy between the obtained lifetime and the time since the last passage is not large to conclude the lack of the intracluster dust in case of @xmath33  k. there are no proper motions available for ngc  1261 , 5634 , and 6402 .",
    "we confirmed that the estimated lifetimes are shorter than the duration in which the intracluster dust can be accumulated since the cluster crossed the galactic plane for at least seven clusters in our sample .",
    "the conclusion for ngc  5024 depends on whether n5024 fis2 belongs to the cluster or not .",
    "the short lifetimes indicate that the intracluster dust is not accumulated as was expected and disappears in a short time scale .",
    "thanks to the high sensitivity of the akari / fis , we could conclude the lack of the intracluster dust even with the lower dust temperature of 35  k.      we have found a candidate of the intracluster dust , n5024 fis2 . here",
    ", we estimate its mass assuming that it is associated with the cluster . the diffuse emission around ngc  6402",
    "can be associated with the cluster as discussed in section [ sec : ngc6402 ] .",
    "however , the clumpy background prevents us from a robust mass estimation , so that we do not include it in quantitative discussions below .",
    "the temperature for n5024 fis2 can not be determined well based on our data because of the small coverage of wavelength ( only in n60 and wide - s ) and the limited photometric accuracy ( @xmath39% ) .",
    "the flux ratio of @xmath40 corresponds to @xmath41  [ k ] .",
    "we perform two estimates assuming 70  k and 35  k again .",
    "then , the dust mass of n5024 fis2 is estimated at @xmath42  m@xmath4 or @xmath43  m@xmath4 for 70  k and 35  k respectively from equation ( [ eq : mdust ] ) .",
    "the former value agrees within a factor of 2 with that of m  15 ir1a @xcite . under the assumption of the proportionality between @xmath19 and [ fe / h ] ,",
    "the corresponding gas mass is 5  m@xmath4 ( or 50  m@xmath4 if @xmath33  k ) so that it is made up of the dust released from a number of stars .",
    "the obtained lifetime @xmath44  yr ( or @xmath36  yr ) is longer than the upper limits obtained above . if we assume the same dust temperature as the cases of m  15 and ngc  6356 , @xmath32 for n5024 fis2 is comparable with the lifetimes for the intracluster dust in these clusters .",
    "there remain a few features to be explained if n5024 fis2 is actually a dust cloud within the cluster .",
    "it is offset from the cluster center , i.e. the bottom of the gravitational potential , by @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "m  15 ir1a is located about @xmath47 @xmath48 to the west of the cluster core .",
    "@xcite argued that the intracluster dust is short - lived and has not been dynamically relaxed .",
    "this can be true for n5024 fis2 too .",
    "another intriguing feature for our case is that n5024 fis2 looks like a point source .",
    "the estimated mass suggests that a couple of dozen mass - losing stars contributed to n5024 fis2 .",
    "the dust clouds released from mass - losing stars aggregated into one blob and it is constrained in a rather small region providing n5024 fis2 is associated with the cluster . on the other hand , if the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath19 does not follow the proportionality ( see section [ sec : lackdust ] ) , the estimated dust mass of n5024 fis2 does not necessarily exceed the amount released from one object . with @xmath49 and @xmath5  k assumed , the estimated amount of the corresponding gas reduces to 0.05  m@xmath4 .",
    "the size evolution of ejecta from a single agb star is discussed by @xcite . in the interaction with the interstellar medium , the size of circumstellar shell",
    "can be restricted to within a few pc , which is as small as the fwhm ( @xmath50 ) of the fis at the distance of ngc  5024 ( 17.8  kpc ) .",
    "it is essential to explain these features in order to conclude the intracluster - dust origin of n5024 fis2",
    ". theoretical work may be useful to study how the materials released from red giants evolve in the intracluster space and interact with each other .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , intracluster matter may have played an important role in the chemical evolution of globular clusters .",
    "@xcite calculated that a significant amount of the mass released from intermediate - mass agb stars can be accreted to surrounding stars in ngc  5139 during 2  gyr .",
    "however , it is possible that no significant mass remains to be accreted if the intracluster matter disappears with the short lifetime mentioned above .",
    "of course , it is not dust but gas that should be considered as the source of the mass to be accreted because @xcite are interested in the enrichment of helium",
    ". the fate of the intracluster gas can be rather different from that of the intracluster dust .",
    "previous observations , however , suggest that the intracluster gas is also deficient in globular clusters as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the deficiency was also reported for ngc  5139 @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of @xcite can be altered if the intracluster gas is removed before it is accreted to the stars within the cluster .",
    "likewise , the fate of the intracluster dust can have an effect on the possible chemical enrichment via the ejecta of evolved stars especially for heavy elements depleted in dust .",
    "for example , aluminum abundance pattern has been also explained by the ejecta of agb stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in any case",
    ", it is of interest to investigate the evolution , destruction , and/or removal of the intracluster gas and dust in the context of their effects on the evolution of globular clusters .",
    "it is possible that globular clusters were embedded in dark matter halos once in the early universe and the intracluster - matter evolution was different from that in current clusters @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , observation of current ones can provide important constraints to be compared with detailed modeling .",
    "besides pointed observations as those presented here , akari accomplished the all - sky survey .",
    "the expected sensitively is lower than those of the pointed observations .",
    "the 5  @xmath51 detection limit in the wide - s filter is 0.55 jy for a point source @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it is similar to that in previous observations made with the iso which resulted in a couple of detections ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the all - sky survey data will enable us to search for the intracluster dust in all the globular clusters with a reasonable detection limit .",
    "on the other hand , with the high sensitivity of the fis pointed observations , a significant number of background galaxies appear above the detection limit . in the future surveys , it can become a problem to discriminate the intracluster dust from the background galaxies unless they are more extended than expected for galaxies .",
    "a potentially useful method is to combine the radio observation for the sources .",
    "it is well known that the fir - radio correlation holds for various kinds of galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite explored the correlation for the far - infrared sources in the lockman hole region based on the iso s survey ( 90 and @xmath52 ) and 1.4  ghz observations with very large array ( vla ) .",
    "we can obtain @xmath53 based on their data .",
    "this value increases to about 6.2 if we consider the blackbody radiation of 70  k. therefore , the radio flux clearly discriminates between the intracluster dust and background galaxies assuming that intracluster dust has a temperature of 70  k as m  15 ir1a . as for the source we detected , @xmath54 of about 100 mjy predicts @xmath55 @xmath0jy for the galaxies and @xmath56  nano - jy for the blackbody radiation of 70  k. though the expected @xmath57 value is lower than the detection limits of the wide - field survey catalog currently available even for the case of galaxies , deep follow - up observations may tell which is the case .",
    "we obtained far - infrared images for 12 globular clusters with the akari / fis , which allowed us to do deep surveys of the cold intracluster dust .",
    "while we found one candidate of the intracluster dust , we confirmed the paucity of such dust in most clusters .    in the fis images",
    ", we detected extended emissions toward two clusters , namely ngc  2808 and ngc  6402 .",
    "they are separated from the galactic plane by less than 15 degrees , and large - scale emission of the galactic cirrus is dominant in their fields .",
    "we suggest that the detected bumps of emission are merely fluctuations of the background emission . in case of ngc  2808",
    ", the emission is largely away from the cluster center , while the bump coincides with the center of ngc  6402 .",
    "we can not rule out the possible dust component associated with ngc  6402 .",
    "on the other hand , we detected 28 point - like sources , but concluded that most of them are background galaxies .",
    "for those with the near - to - mid infrared data by the akari / irc , the obtained seds resemble those of galaxies .",
    "we found one source , n5024 fis2 , without any clear counterpart in the mid infrared .",
    "there is no galaxy found in the hst / acs image at around the coordinate .",
    "it is a possible candidate of the intracluster dust .",
    "if so and the temperature of 70  k is assumed , the dust mass is estimated at @xmath42  m@xmath4 . however , some intriguing features such as the point - like appearance remain to be explained if n5024 fis2 actually belongs to the cluster . besides the candidate",
    ", our results give upper limits of 29 @xmath58  m@xmath4 within the half - mass radii of the 12 clusters from the background fluctuation .",
    "some mechanism(s ) are clearly efficient to remove the intracluster dust in most clusters , if not all .",
    "the lifetime of the intracluster dust is as short as @xmath59 yr . on the other hand",
    ", we found that the intracluster dust detected in m  15 and ngc  6356 is exceptionally large compared with other clusters .",
    "our result strengthens the mystery of the lack of the intracluster dust .",
    "it urges us to study physical processes which determine the fate of the intracluster dust .",
    "together with that of the intracluster gas , it has a potential to affect the evolution of globular clusters .",
    "we acknowledges the anonymous referee whose helpful comments gave us a chance to improve the paper .",

    "<S> we report the observations of 12 globular clusters with the far - infrared surveyor ( fis ) on - board akari infrared satellite . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to search for emission from the cold dust within clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we detect diffuse emissions toward ngc  6402 and 2808 , but the iras 100  @xmath0 m maps show the presence of strong background radiation . </S>",
    "<S> they are likely emitted from the galactic cirrus , while we can not rule out the possible association of a bump of emission with the cluster in the case of ngc  6402 . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect 28 point - like sources mainly in the wide - s images ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> at least several of them are not associated with the clusters but background galaxies based on some external catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> we present the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) by combining the near - and - mid infrared data obtained with the infrared camera ( irc ) if possible . </S>",
    "<S> the seds suggest that most of the point sources are background galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find one candidate of the intracluster dust which has no mid - infrared counterpart unlike the other point - like sources , although some features such as its point - like appearance should be explained before we conclude its intracluster origin . for most of the other clusters , we have confirmed the lack of the intracluster dust . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate upper limits of the intracluster dust mass to be between @xmath2 and @xmath3  m@xmath4 depending on the dust temperature . the lifetime of the intracluster dust inferred from the upper limits is shorter than 5  myr ( @xmath5  k ) or 50  myr ( 35  k ) . </S>",
    "<S> such short lifetime indicates some mechanism(s ) are at work to remove the intracluster dust . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss its impact on the chemical evolution of globular clusters . </S>"
