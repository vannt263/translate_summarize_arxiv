    "however , to fully understand the processes of planet and binary star formation , it is essential that the frequency of companions is measured over the maximum possible range of separations .",

    "during the nights of 2000 may 10 , june 27 , and september 16 - 18 , we used the shack - hartmann ao system on the keck  ii telescope ( wizinowich et al .",

    "the h - band filter was selected for all observations because it produces the optimum combination of spatial resolution and sensitivity and because substellar objects are relatively bright in this band .",
    "the targets were grouped into pairs of stars that were close together on the sky ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the stars in a pair were observed in succession so that the data for one star provided an estimate of the psf for the other star .",

    "the star was first centered in one of the three operating quadrants of the array . the exposure time and neutral density filter",
    "were selected such that the maximum number of counts in the image was between 50 and 80% of the saturation level , where 5  sec and n3 were typical choices for a star at @xmath24 .",
    "multiple exposures were obtained at each of two positions that were separated by @xmath25 ( 5 pixels ) along the rows and columns of the array .",
    "similar exposures were obtained through the less opaque neutral density filters and the open filter to reach successively fainter magnitudes .",
    "the same steps were then followed for the star that was paired to this target .",
    "these data are used to search for companions within the quadrant surrounding each star ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the following observations were designed to reach larger separations .",
    "a target was centered in the upper left quadrant of the camera array . because the area of the array directly surrounding the target was already imaged and would be saturated in long exposures , the telescope was offset by @xmath27 ( 128 pixels ) in each direction on the array to place the star near the center of the lower right dead quadrant .",
    "three images were obtained at each position in the same dither pattern used previously .",
    "each image consisted of the sum of two exposures with integration times of 30  sec for most stars and 5  sec for the brightest targets , which were short enough to avoid saturation within the operating quadrants of the array .",
    "as a result , the total integration time was typically 6  min .",
    "these steps for the long exposures were repeated at two additional position angles at intervals of @xmath28 , providing full and partial coverage out to radii of @xmath6 and @xmath29 surrounding each star .",

    "we now comment on a few departures from the above observing strategy .",
    "the observations of @xmath30  55  cnc and 47  uma differed from the standard procedure because the observations of these two objects were completed before the final strategy was adopted .",
    "only the n3 and open external filters were used for these stars . in addition , only short exposure times were used for 47  uma .",

    "two of the stars with faint nearby sources in the keck data , hd  187123 and hd  37124 , were observed with the university of hawaii hokupaa ao system in conjunction with the @xmath31 near - ir camera quirc ( graves et al .",

    "the plate scale of quirc was @xmath32  pixel@xmath18 , corresponding to a total field of @xmath33 .",
    "we obtained twelve 30  sec exposures of hd  187123 and seven 1  sec exposures of hd  37124 through the @xmath21-band filter .",
    "these exposure times were selected to minimize the saturation of the primary stars while providing sufficient sensitivity to detect the faint sources found in the keck data , thus optimizing the astrometry for those sources relative to the primaries .",
    "the gemini ao data for hd  187123 and hd  37124 exhibited fwhm@xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "standard data reduction procedures were followed for the ao images .",
    "the keck images were divided by twilight sky flat frames , while the gemini data were divided by dome flat frames .",
    "offsets between dithered frames were measured from the centroids of nonsaturated point sources or the isophotes around saturated stars .",
    "dithered frames were then combined into one image .",
    "the properties of the keck ao data are illustrated in figure  [ fig : mosaic ] , which shows images of 51  peg at various signal levels .",
    "the ao - corrected psf is characterized by a bright narrow core whose width ( fwhm@xmath36  pixels ) approaches the diffraction limit and a low - level broad halo that is comparable in size to the seeing disc ( fwhm@xmath37  pixels ) .",
    "astronomical point sources must be distinguished from point - like speckles that reside within the halo .",
    "this was accomplished by visually comparing the images of a given pair of targets that were observed consecutively and thus act as psf stars for each other .",
    "in addition , because most of the psf features rotate on the array ( and thus the sky ) with time , we could distinguish speckles from astronomical sources by comparing the images at the individual dither positions for a star . at larger radii from a star ,",
    "the features of the psf are radially elongated and therefore are not mistaken for companions .",
    "the sources that were found in this manner are listed in table  [ tab : cand ] .",

    "[ fig : hd37124]-[fig : hd190228 ] .",
    "the array coordinates and photometry of the point sources near the target stars were measured with the iraf tasks imexamine and phot , respectively .",
    "aperture photometry was extracted with a radius of 3 to 6 pixels in the keck data , where fainter sources were measured with smaller radii .",
    "photometric calibration was derived from aperture photometry with radii of 40 pixels of the unsaturated images of the target stars .",
    "when available , the @xmath21-band measurements from the two - micron all - sky survey were adopted .",
    "otherwise , the @xmath21 magnitudes were estimated by combining the spectral types and visual magnitudes of the targets .",
    "most of the keck images were obtained in photometric conditions and the calibrations implied by the various targets agree within @xmath38  mag . because the conditions were not photometric during the gemini observations , photometry is not measured from those data . after measuring the aperture corrections between 40 and 3 - 6 pixels from the unsaturated keck images of the targets",
    ", we arrived at @xmath21-band magnitudes for the point sources , which are given in table  [ tab : cand ] .",
    "because the fraction of the star s light that falls within the psf core can change significantly between consecutive images , the absolute photometry has large uncertainties of @xmath39  mag .",
    "multiple observations of the point source near hd  37124 suggest a smaller photometric error of @xmath40  mag . because the two sources near hd  187123 were measured in the same image , their relative photometry should have good precision ( @xmath41  mag ) . similarly , the relative positions of multiple sources near a star have small errors ( @xmath42  pixels ) . meanwhile , the offsets of the faint sources from the central stars are more uncertain because the latter were saturated or in the dead quadrant in the images where the former were detected .",
    "as described in the previous section , extra images were obtained for hd  37124 , hd  187123 , and hd  168443 so that the faint sources and the primaries would both appear in good quadrants of the array .",
    "the uncertainties in the offsets between saturated primaries and the surrounding objects are @xmath43  pixel in each direction on the array . in the gemini data , both the candidate companions and the primaries fell within the array as well .",
    "for the faint sources near hd  190228 , we have only the original long exposures in which the primary fell in the dead quadrant . in these data , we used the isophotes of the primary s psf that extended into the good quadrants to estimate the position of the primary , and thus the offset between the faint sources and the primary .",
    "the uncertainties in those offsets are @xmath44  pixels . by obtaining images of an artificial light source within the keck ao system at several positions across the array , we measured a plate scale of @xmath45  pixel@xmath18 for kcam",
    ". a plate scale of @xmath46  pixel@xmath18 in the @xmath21-band has been measured for the quirc camera on gemini by f. rigaut .",
    "these plate scales were combined with the position angles of the instruments and the pixel offsets to compute the offsets in right ascension and declination that are listed in table  [ tab : cand ] .",
    "we now characterize the sensitivity to companions of the keck ao data .",
    "we began by measuring the @xmath21-band detection limits for point sources as a function of angular separation from the targets . to remove the large - scale shape of the psf of the target stars , each image was convolved with a two - dimensional gaussian function and divided into the original image . in the quotient image , we measured the standard deviation in five pixel square boxes at one pixel intervals along a line radially outward from star , which was then repeated for radial lines at several other angles around the star that avoided ghost images of the primary . at the image positions measured in this way , we inserted artificial stars that simulated the core of the psf , which were given the fwhm measured from the unsaturated image of the star and a peak intensity that equaled a multiple of the standard deviation measured at that point in the image .",
    "after visually examining the artificial stars at several values of this multiple , we adopted six sigma as a reasonable representation of the detection limit .",
    "the sources detected around hd  190228 in figure  [ fig : hd190228 ] are near this detection limit .",
    "in addition , eight artificial stars have been placed at the detection limit of @xmath1 at @xmath2 in one of the images of 51  peg in figure  [ fig : mosaic ] . within the seeing disc ,",
    "the presence of speckles complicates the characterization of the detection limit .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , real point sources can be identified down to the amplitude of the speckles . as a result",
    ", the speckles effectively define the detection limit for point sources .",
    "because the six sigma deviations measured from 5  pixel boxes in the seeing disc were comparable to the speckles intensities ( i.e. , the speckles are sparsely distributed relative to this box size ) , we adopted the former measurement for characterizing the detection limit both inside and outside of the seeing disc .",
    "for a given star , the @xmath21-band detection limits were measured for the various filters , exposure times , and position angles and the combined results were fit by one polynomial function .",
    "the differences of the @xmath21-band detection limits for point sources and the magnitudes of the target stars ( @xmath47 ) are presented as a function of angular separation in figs .",
    "[ fig : p1]-[fig : p7 ] .",
    "the ghost images that appear in the long exposures result in an 2 - 3% incompleteness in areal coverage . because the observations of @xmath30  55  cnc and 47  uma were not optimized for dynamic range , the images were less sensitive to companions at intermediate separations , as indicated by the data for these stars in figure  [ fig : p3 ] .",
    "in addition , the detection limit at large separations for 47  uma was worse than for the other stars because only short exposures were obtained .",

    "we have obtained images at a second epoch for five of the brightest candidate companions .",
    "these sources all exhibit proper motions relative to the central stars that are consistent with those expected of background stars .",
    "the remaining faint sources are probably background stars as well given the low galactic latitude of the four targets .",
    "we have measured the point source detection limits for the ao images , which are presented in terms of both angular separation versus @xmath47 and projected physical separation versus companion mass .",
    "the sensitivities correspond to @xmath1 at @xmath2 and l and t dwarfs at @xmath3 to @xmath4 from the planet - bearing stars ( @xmath91 - 6 ) .",
    "these data reach companion stars and brown dwarfs at 3 - 10  au and 10 - 100  au from the planet - bearing stars in this study , providing an essential complement to previous radial velocity measurements of these systems ( @xmath8  @xmath9 , @xmath92  au ) .",
