    "<S> the full spin density fluctuations ( sdf ) spectra in 3__d _ _ paramagnetic metals are analyzed from first principles using the linear response technique . using the calculated complete wavevector and energy dependence of the dynamic spin susceptibility </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the most important , but elusive , characteristic of sdf in solids : on - site spin correlator ( sc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the sdf have a mixed character consisting of interacting collective and single - particle excitations of similar strength spreading continuously over the entire brillouin zone and a wide energy range up to femtosecond time scales . </S>",
    "<S> these excitations can not be adiabatically separated and their intrinsically multiscale nature should be always taken into account for a proper description of metallic systems . </S>",
    "<S> overall , in all studied systems , despite the lack of local moment , we found a very large sc resulting in an effective fluctuating moment of the order of several bohr magnetons .    </S>",
    "<S> sdf in metals@xcite determine the magnetic dynamics and play an important role in many technologically important applications including invar alloys@xcite , spintronics@xcite , and high temperature superconductors@xcite including newly discovered ferropnictides@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sdf are also crucial in physics of quantum phase transitions including quantum criticallity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a description of sdf in real metallic systems is challenging due to the itinerant nature of the valence electrons . </S>",
    "<S> theories based on the localized heisenberg model , which are very successful in magnetic insulators , are no longer applicable because of this itineracy . </S>",
    "<S> a proper dynamic treatment of essentially quantum sdf is crucial especially at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> however , the strength and the structure of such itinerant spin fluctuations has not yet been established on neither qualitative nor quantitative level in any material .    </S>",
    "<S> the key quantity characterizing sdf in itinerant systems is sc which represents the on - site spin density correlation function ( see , e.g. , ref ) . according to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) </S>",
    "<S> , sc can be obtained from the imaginary part of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 by integrating over all wavevectors @xmath1 and energies @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally @xmath0 can be obtained from inelastic neutron scattering experiments , but such measurements can only probe energies up to 0.2 - 0.3 ev and typically access only limited parts of the brillouion zone ( bz)@xcite . correspondingly , only an approximate estimation of sc can be obtained experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the effective moment of about 1 @xmath3 was found in doped ymn@xmath4 leading to a prediction of ` giant spin fluctuations ' in this material@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is unclear , however , how these results would be modified if a larger energy range and a proper bz integration would be included .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretical treatments of itinerant sdf have also been restricted to both limited wavevectors and frequency range studies . if the traditional model spin fluctuation and/or quantum criticallity theories employed long wavelength and low frequency approximations ( see e.g. , refs . ) , the more recent electronic structure studies focused on pure intraatomic sdf using many - body perturbation theory@xcite or dmft@xcite approaches . while applications of these two opposite limiting cases of sdf treatment have been successful in the description of many metallic systems , their essentially adjustable nature and uncontrollable approximations do not allow us to understand the relative roles of the different spatial or energy scales of sdf . clearly , a comprehensive analysis of sdf in the entire bz and for a wide energy range is needed .    </S>",
    "<S> it is a goal of this paper to present such analysis using realistic electronic structure calculations . to focus on pure itinerant sdf </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a prototype system of 3__d _ _ paramagnets where the local moments are absent . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the strength and the character of such sdf as well as establish their spatial and energy scales which should be included for a proper description of ground state and thermodynamic properties of metals .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic spin susceptibility , @xmath5 , was evaluated using the linear response theory within the local density approximation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we used an in - house electronic structure code based on the full - potential linear augmented plane waves method@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mixed product basis set@xcite was adapted . </S>",
    "<S> calculations were done at finite temperature using the matsubara technique . </S>",
    "<S> first , the kohn - sham ( or bare ) susceptibility @xmath6 was evaluated in the real space and in the matsubara time domain following the approach that was used for calculations of the polarizability in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> next , the kohn - sham susceptibility was transformed to the reciprocal space and the matsubara frequency domain . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement factor was then calculated and @xmath5 was found . </S>",
    "<S> the real frequency axis results were obtained using the analytical continuation based on continued fraction expansion@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> paramagnetic sdf can be described in terms of the following spectral function    @xmath7    here the factor of three corresponds to a number of polarizations and we integrated the @xmath8 and @xmath9 variables over the atomic sphere . </S>",
    "<S> further we also define the density of on - site sdf @xmath10 and the number of on - site sdf @xmath11 as follows    @xmath12    correspondingly , when the kohn - sham susceptibility is used in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a ] ) and ( [ nndefs ] ) , such functions are referred to as bare quantities and we denote them by subscript @xmath13 .    an important measure of the strength of sdf is provided by the sc which is defined as the equal - time on - site spin density correlation function and can be obtained from @xmath10 using the fdt    @xmath14    the evaluation of the sc by a straightforward energy integration is problematic since the integrand in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fdt ] ) converge very slowly with energy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we used a contour technique and performed the energy integration on the imaginary frequency axis@xcite resulting in a much better convergence and an accurate sc .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider 3__d _ _ paramagnets ( sc , ti , v , cr , cu , and zn ) at room temperature . for cr a paramagetic potential was used . </S>",
    "<S> experimental crystal structures were assumed with hcp for sc , ti , and zn , fcc for cu , and bcc for v and cr . for cubic and hcp lattices we used 20@xmath1520@xmath1520 and 12@xmath1512@xmath1512 k - point mesh , respectively . for all materials , the local orbitals for the 3__s _ </S>",
    "<S> _ and 3__p _ _ semicore states were added to the basis function set . in the case of cu and </S>",
    "<S> zn the local orbitals for the 4__d _ _ states were included as well . </S>",
    "<S> for the basis , the energy cutoff in the interstitial region was set to 2.5 ry and the angular momentum cutoff inside the muffin - tin sphere was set to @xmath16 . for the product basis functions we used the interstitial energy cutoff of 3.5 ry and the muffin - tin angular momentum cutoff of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we used 158 nonuniformly distributed ( see ref . for details ) mesh points on the imaginary matsubara time axis . </S>",
    "<S> we ensured that the results are well converged with respect to the above parameters .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical axis units are @xmath19 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider sdf for small wavevectors . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ paramagnons ] shows the spectral function for a fixed low magnitude @xmath1 as a function of the frequency within the neutron scattering energy range . for sc </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath20 has a broad peak at around 0.05 ev . a similar feature ( </S>",
    "<S> although at higher energy ) is observed for the bare spectral function @xmath21 suggesting that the peak predominantly originates from single particle stoner excitations . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , an analysis of the sc band structure@xcite suggests that this feature corresponds to electronic transitions within the flat band that crosses the fermi level near the h point in the bz . </S>",
    "<S> the many body effects , however , still play an important role by significantly enhancing the peak and shifting it to lower energies . for v , @xmath20 has a broad maximum at around 0.12 ev with the width of around 0.25 ev . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 has a somewhat similar feature at higher energies indicating that , as in the case of sc , the peak originates from the kohn - sham susceptibility but is enhanced and shifted to lower energies by electronic correlations . for other materials , the spectral functions in fig.[paramagnons ] are featureless . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the sdf for these wavevectors are also controlled by stoner excitations .    . </S>",
    "<S> ]    information about the sdf for other wavevectors can be obtained by analyzing the density of sdf ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ nndefs ] ) which , according to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nndefs ] ) , include sdf from the entire bz . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath10 and @xmath22 have a completely different shape from the corresponding spectral function . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the excitations with large wavevectors also play an important role . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , detailed analysis of our data revealed that sdf in all materials reside in the entire bz . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , restriction to excitations from only limited parts of the bz ( for instance the long wave approximation commonly used in spin fluctuations theories or dmft single - site approximation ) can lead to an inaccurate description of sdf .    </S>",
    "<S> except for cu and zn , the @xmath10 curves can be viewed as superpositions of several peaks . </S>",
    "<S> most of these peaks lie at relatively high energies and , therefore , one may expect that they originate from single - particle stoner excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of such excitations is described by @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , @xmath23 clearly shows a significant amount of single particle sdf . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath23 is equal to @xmath10 only for energies larger than the effective electronic bandwidth ( @xmath24 5 ev ) . for @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> the two differ significantly . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the electronic correlations significantly enhance the the single - particle spectrum and shift it to lower energies . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that in the energy range up to @xmath26 sdf in 3__d _ _ paramagnetic metals are a complicated mixture of mutually interacting single - particle and collective excitations . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , realistic paramagnetic sdf can not be treated as pure bose excitations ( as usually assumed@xcite ) .     as a function of energy . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical axis units are @xmath27 . ]    an important conclusion that follows from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ nsf ] is that sdf exist in a wide energy range extending up to several ev . </S>",
    "<S> this is even better illustrated in the top panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ m2 ] where the number of sdf , @xmath28 , ( eq . [ nndefs ] ) is plotted as a function @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the main plot shows the full spectrum while the inset presents the low - energy range that is accessible to neutron scattering experiments . </S>",
    "<S> as seen , the low - energy part ( picosecond time scales ) constitutes only a small fraction of the full sdf spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for early 3__d _ _ paramagnets ( sc , ti , v , cr ) approximately above 0.5 ev , @xmath11 starts to rapidly increase until the energy @xmath26 is reached . in this ultrafast energy range ( femtosecond time scale ) , the majority of sdf reside . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath29 , only a slow increase of @xmath11 is observed . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to sdf involving semicore and/or high - energy unoccupied states . </S>",
    "<S> these high - energy transitions are main contributions to sdf for cu and zn where the 3__d _ _ band is almost fully occupied . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for all 3__d _ _ </S>",
    "<S> paramagnets , the majority of sdf lie at energies much higher than those accessible from inelastic neutron scattering experiments requiring ultrafast experiments ( high - energy spin resolved spectroscopies@xcite ) to probe the full sdf spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that for all considered materials , @xmath11 is a continuous steadily increasing function of energy and it is not possible to rigorously introduce any energy cutoff when describing sdf in paramagnetic metals . </S>",
    "<S> overall , these materials represent a slow - fast spin system with a strong interaction between time scales so adiabaticity criterion is not fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for instance , with the temperature increase , more sdf are excited and contribute to the magnetic properties of the itinerant metal . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is in stark contrast with the traditional slow - fast system of magnetic insulator where time scales are well separated so that sdf for energies above spin wave spectrum do not exist and _ all _ sdf are excited at corresponding temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider sc which is a major characteristic of the sdf and is related to the effective paramagnetic atomic moment ( @xmath30 ) by @xmath31 . according to fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ m2 ] ( top ) , a dominant contribution to sc arises from sdf lying in the energy range from 0.5 ev up to @xmath26 . in this regime , @xmath32 and , </S>",
    "<S> thus , the sc originates mainly from spin zero - point motion sdf . </S>",
    "<S> however , even low energy sdf can create a significant sc which can be detected experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> for example , as seen from the inset in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ m2 ] , spin zero - point motion contribution to sc ( given by @xmath11 ) at the energy of 0.3 ev results in @xmath30 of 0.3 - 0.6 @xmath33 for paramagnets with partially filled 3__d _ _ shell .    ) as a function of the the number of 3__d _ _ electrons ( red ) . </S>",
    "<S> blue curve denote the bare @xmath30 evaluated using the kohn - sham susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> the shaded area indicates the 3__d _ _ electron range corresponding to the magnetically ordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows @xmath30 as a function of @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the number of 3__d _ _ electrons and holes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the line in the inset is the linear fit of the data . ]    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spcurve ] shows @xmath30 ( evaluated from the entire sdf spectrum ) for all 3__d _ _ paramagnets . </S>",
    "<S> as seen , for all considered materials , @xmath30 has a value of several @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the bare @xmath30 that originate purely from single particle sdf is also appreciable . in particular , for cu and zn , it is essentially equal to @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a small contribution of sdf to the correlations . for other 3__d _ _ </S>",
    "<S> paramagnets , however , the difference between @xmath30 and the bare @xmath30 is appreciable ( 1@xmath33 for cr ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a significant effect of sdf on all ground state and thermodynamic properties is expected in these materials . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the measure of the sdf correlation energy is provided by @xmath37 with @xmath38 being an interaction parameter and @xmath39 ( see , for instance , recent review in ref . ) . as seen in the bottom panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ m2 ] , while @xmath40 is negligible for both cu and zn , it is large for other metals and at the energy of the order @xmath26 it practically reaches its total value . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for paramagnets with partially filled 3__d _ _ shell , sdf corresponding to this @xmath40 should be explicitly included in electronic structure calculations and all the energies up to @xmath26 should be treated on equal footing . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that for all considered materials the local moment is zero and , therefore , these sdf are purely itinerant and can not be described by the heisenberg model . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , one can expect that in ferromagnetic metals such itinerant sdf also play a significant role and , correspondingly , should be taken into account simultaneously with the heisenberg local moment fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> let us analyze how sdf depend on the 3__d _ _ band population . as seen from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ m2 ] , the low energy part of @xmath11 does nt show any clear dependence on the 3__d _ _ band filling since it is mainly determined by the detailed structure of the fermi surface and , thus , it is a very material specific part of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however , for large energies , the intensity of sdf increases with a number of unpaired 3__d _ _ electrons . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the dependence of @xmath30 on the 3__d _ _ electron number is reminiscent of the slater pauling curve for ferromagnetic metals ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spcurve ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> below the half - filling , @xmath30 increases with the 3__d _ _ electron number . </S>",
    "<S> above the half - filling , however , an opposite trend is observed . </S>",
    "<S> two mechanisms that are similar in strength but differ in origin are responsible for such behavior . </S>",
    "<S> first , as indicated by the blue curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spcurve ] , the number of stoner single particle excitations within the 3__d _ _ band is maximized at half - filling . </S>",
    "<S> second , the many body enhancement due to electronic correlations is also the strongest for a half - filled band .    in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spcurve ] , we show @xmath30 as a function of the effective number 3__d _ _ carriers @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the number of 3__d _ _ electrons and holes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find that @xmath30 shows approximately a linear dependence on @xmath44 according to the following empirical formula    @xmath45    the above indicates that every 3__d _ _ electron or hole contributes approximately the moment of 0.4@xmath33 to @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the nonzero intercept corresponds to @xmath30 for a completely filled or completely empty 3__d _ _ band . </S>",
    "<S> it originates from electronic transitions involving semicore levels and high - energy unoccupied states .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we investigated the structure of sdf for 3__d _ _ paramagnetic metals . </S>",
    "<S> a strong sc corresponding to the effective magnetic fluctuating moment of the order of the several bohr magnetons was obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we found that sdf in these systems have a mixed nature and consist of interacting single particle stoner and collective excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that no well defined quantum statistics can be assigned to these excitations . </S>",
    "<S> these sdf are rather strong and spread continuously over the entire bz as well as the wide energy range . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , such sdf can be accessed only by very different energy scale measurements ranging from neutron to ultrafast experiments . from a point of view of theory , </S>",
    "<S> no well defined wavevector and frequency cutoffs ( as often assumed ) can be reliably introduced in such materials . in particular , for the correct description of spin fluctuations induced phenomena in metals all such sdf should be included on equal footing without usage of any long wave length or atomistic approximations . </S>"
