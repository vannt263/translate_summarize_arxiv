    "mnv s universality theorem was a fundamental breakthrough in the theory of oriented matroids and convex polytopes .",
    "it states that the realization spaces of oriented matroids and polytopes , i.e.  the spaces of point configurations with fixed oriented matroid / face lattice , can be arbitrarily complex .",
    "it comes in four flavours :    [ thm : universality ] let @xmath0 be a primary basic semialgebraic set defined over @xmath1 , then    [ it : uom ] there is an * oriented matroid * of rank @xmath2 whose realization space is stably equivalent to @xmath0 , and    [ it : up ] there is a * polytope * whose realization space is stably equivalent to @xmath0 ;    if moreover @xmath0 is open , then    [ it : uuom ] there is a * uniform oriented matroid * of rank @xmath2 whose realization space is stably equivalent to @xmath0 , and    [ it : usp ] there is a * simplicial polytope * whose realization space is stably equivalent to @xmath0 .",
    "mnv announced this theorem in 1985 @xcite and published a sketch of the proof in 1988 @xcite .",
    "a more detailed reasoning can be found in his thesis @xcite ( in russian ) .",
    "shor @xcite simplified a key step in mnv s line of reasoning for part and .",
    "moreover , part of theorem  [ thm : universality ] was later elaborated upon by richter - gebert @xcite and gnzel @xcite , who proved the stronger _",
    "universal partition theorem _ for oriented matroids . using lawrence extensions to rigidify the face lattices ,",
    "it is easy to prove part from part @xcite@xcite . here",
    ", a face lattice is called _ rigid _ if it uniquely determines the oriented matroid defined by its vertices . additionally , theorem  [ thm : universality ] was generalized greatly by richter - gebert , who proved that already @xmath3-dimensional polytopes are universal @xcite@xcite .    for a proof of part , in contrast , only mnv s original papers are available , apart of some preliminary results of sturmfels @xcite and bokowski  guedes de oliveira @xcite .",
    "moreover , mnv s elaborations for this case in @xcite@xcite are specially concise and , in our opinion , incomplete . hence , we think part   of theorem  [ thm : universality ] , although widely believed to be true , should be considered open until now .",
    "it is important to stress that , despite the wrong common belief , lawrence extensions _ can not _ be used to deduce the universality theorem for simplicial polytopes .",
    "we use a different approach to rigidify matroids , namely one based on a result of shemer proving rigidity of neighborly polytopes  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we establish here that _",
    "neighborly _ polytopes , i.e.  @xmath4-polytopes with a complete @xmath5-skeleton , are universal .",
    "even more , we obtain this result with even - dimensional polytopes .",
    "since all neighborly polytopes of even dimension are simplicial , this provides a proof of theorem  [ thm : universality ] .",
    "[ thm : unin ] every open primary basic semialgebraic set defined over @xmath1 is stably equivalent to the realization space of some neighborly @xmath6-dimensional polytope on @xmath7 vertices .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of cyclic polytopes , who have trivial realization spaces ( * ? ?",
    "* example  5.1 ) .",
    "this holds more generally for all totally sewn and gale sewn polytopes @xcite@xcite , of which cyclic polytopes are a particular case .",
    "these are large families of neighborly polytopes . indeed ,",
    "the number of gale sewn polytopes with @xmath8 vertices in a fixed dimension @xmath4 is asymptotically at least @xmath9 , which is the current best lower bound for the number of _ all _ polytopes @xcite .",
    "[ thm : sewn ]    the ( homogenized ) realization space of any even - dimensional neighborly @xmath4-polytope on @xmath8 vertices constucted with the extended sewing or the gale sewing construction is contractible , and in fact an open , piecewise smooth @xmath10-ball .    encouraged by the work of richter - gebert",
    ", we make the daring conjecture that universality holds even when we restrict to neighborly @xmath3-dimensional polytopes .",
    "every open primary basic semialgebraic set defined over @xmath1 is stably equivalent to the realization space of some neighborly ( and hence simplicial ) @xmath3-polytope .",
    "a universality conjecture for simplicial @xmath3-polytopes is supported by the existence of simplicial @xmath3-polytopes without the isotopy property , that is , with disconnected realization space @xcite .",
    "the following idea provides further motivation for our conjecture .",
    "altshuler and steinberg proved that vertex figures of neighborly @xmath3-polytopes are always @xmath2-dimensional stacked polytopes @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that realization spaces of stacked polytopes are trivial , their oriented matroids can be complicated : notice that if @xmath11 is any planar point configuration , then there exists a stacked @xmath2-polytope @xmath12 with a distinguished vertex @xmath13 such that the contraction of @xmath13 in @xmath12 coincides with @xmath11 .",
    "now , realization spaces of planar point configurations are universal , and it is conceivable that these realization spaces can be captured by constructing neighborly @xmath3-polytopes having them as edge contractions , combined with the fact that all neighborly 4-polytopes are rigid .",
    "the _ realization space _ @xmath14 of an oriented matroid @xmath11 is the set of vector configurations that share the same oriented matroid , i.e.  if @xmath11 is of rank @xmath4 , and @xmath15 is the ground set of @xmath11 , then @xmath16 similarly , if @xmath12 is a polytope in @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is its vertex set , then we define its ( homogenized ) realization space as @xmath19 hence , the realization space @xmath20 of a polytope is the union of the realization spaces of all oriented matroids whose ( las vergnas ) face lattice ( i.e.  the dual to the lattice of positive cocircuits ) coincides with the face lattice of @xmath12 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "a _ basic semialgebraic set _ in @xmath17 is the set of solutions to a finite number of rational polynomial equalities and inequalities ; it is called _ primary _ if all the inequalities in its definition are strict . a basic semialgebraic set",

    "we denote the stable equivalence of @xmath28 and @xmath29 as @xmath33 .",
    "we refer to @xcite@xcite for more detailed definitions of these concepts .    a technique that pervades our proofs is the use of _ lexicographic extensions _",
    "( see  ( * ? ? ? * section  7.2 ) ) .",
    "when @xmath11 is realized by a vector configuration @xmath0 , then its lexicographic extension by @xmath34 $ ] , where @xmath35 are elements of @xmath0 and @xmath36 are signs , is realized by adjoining to @xmath0 the vector @xmath37 for any @xmath38 small enough ( cf .",

    "we start with an observation of mnv / shor concerning universality of uniform oriented matroids @xcite@xcite , which is proven using constructible oriented matroids and a substitution technique from @xcite@xcite .",
    "the key step of the proof of theorem  [ thm : unin ] is to use a construction of kortenkamp , who proved that every @xmath4-dimensional point configuration of at most @xmath44 points appears as a face figure of a neighborly polytope  @xcite . for larger point configurations ,",
    "this is still an open problem , first asked by perles .",
    "for the proof , recall that in oriented matroid theory a polytope is called _ rigid _ if the face lattice of @xmath12 determines the oriented matroid @xmath11 spanned by the vertices of @xmath12 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.6 ) ) .",
    "in particular , for all rigid polytopes , we have @xmath45 .      by a theorem of kortenkamp ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.2 ) , every realizable oriented matroid of rank @xmath2 can be extended to the gale dual of an even - dimensional neighborly polytope by performing @xmath8 lexicographic extensions , obtaining a rank @xmath2 matroid @xmath48 on @xmath7 elements . by lemma  [ lem : lex ]",
    "we obtain @xmath49 let @xmath12 be the face lattice of the gale dual of @xmath50 .",
    "now , oriented matroid duality preserves realization spaces and , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.10 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.2 ) , every neighborly polytope of even dimension is rigid .",
    "hence , @xmath51      let @xmath12 be a polytope with a flag of faces @xmath52 , and define @xmath53 .",
    "a point @xmath54 is said to be _ sewn _ onto @xmath12 through @xmath55 if it realizes the lexicographic extension of @xmath12 by @xmath56 $ ] , where these sets represent their elements in any order .",
    "shemer  @xcite proved that if @xmath12 is even dimensional and neighborly and @xmath54 is sewn through a _ universal flag _ then @xmath57 is also neighborly . here , a _ universal flag _ of @xmath12 is a flag consisting of faces in every odd dimension , and such that the quotients of @xmath12 by these faces are still neighborly .",
    "this is extended in @xcite by relaxing the condition of being a universal flag to containing a universal subflag .",
    "this technique of generating neighborly polytopes  iteratively sewing starting from a cyclic polytope  is called _ the ( extended ) sewing construction _ ( see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) for details ) .",
    "similarly , let @xmath11 be the oriented matroid of a neighborly @xmath4-polytope @xmath12 , with dual @xmath58 , and let @xmath59 be an oriented matroid whose dual is obtained by doing first a lexicographic extension in general position of @xmath58 by @xmath60 $ ] followed by a lexicographic extension by @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath59 is also the oriented matroid of a neighborly polytope ( of dimension @xmath62 ) .",
    "this operation is called _ gale sewing _ , and the neighborly polytopes obtained by repeating this procedure from a polygon or a @xmath2-polytope are called _ gale sewn _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "cyclic polytopes arise as a special case of these constructions : they can be obtained by repeatedly extended sewing from a simplex , as well as by gale sewing from a polygon or certain stacked @xmath2-polytope @xcite .",
    "observe first that , since these are even - dimensional neighborly polytopes , they are rigid and therefore it suffices to argue at the level of realization spaces of oriented matroids ( instead of polytopes ) .",
    "moreover , up to a change to the dual in gale sewing that does not affect the realization space , both constructions are based on performing a sequence of lexicographic extensions starting on a configuration with trivial realization space .",
    "hence , at the oriented matroid level , their realizations spaces are open and contractible .",
    "indeed , in each step the fibers of the deletion map are open polyhedra ( lemma  [ lem : lex ] ) .",
    "even more , since these fibers are piecewise polynomially ( and hence piecewise smoothly ) parametrized , then the whole realization space is a piecewise smooth ball .",
