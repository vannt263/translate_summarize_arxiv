    "in the parton model , a hadron is regarded as a collection of quarks , antiquarks , and gluons , each of which carries some fraction @xmath3 of the hadron s momentum , with a number density @xmath4 , where @xmath0 is the factorization scale .",
    "qualitatively , the factorization scale corresponds to the resolution with which the hadron is being probed . to calculate the cross section for processes in hadron - hadron or lepton - hadron collisions ,",
    "the partonic cross section is convolved with the corresponding parton distribution functions @xmath4 .",
    "the partonic ( hard - scattering ) cross section is independent of the factorization scale @xmath0 at leading order in perturbative qcd , but depends logarithmically on @xmath0 at next - to - leading order and higher .",
    "when calculated to all orders in perturbative qcd , the hadronic cross section is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "however , at any finite order in perturbation theory , the calculated hadronic cross section depends on @xmath0 .",
    "this dependence is usually significant at low orders in perturbation theory .",
    "one could conclude that the only way to obtain a reliable prediction is to calculate higher - order corrections until the factorization - scale dependence is reduced . however , there are many processes for which higher - order corrections are not available .",
    "it is in these cases that the question of factorization - scale choice is most important .    if the hard - scattering cross section is characterized by a single scale @xmath2 ( such as the invariant mass of the lepton pair in drell - yan production ) , then the factorization scale is usually chosen to be of order @xmath2 , simply because there is no other scale in the problem . however",
    ", this reveals only the order of magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "it is common to vary the factorization scale over some interval , perhaps @xmath5 , but there is no objective argument for either the central value or the range of variation .",
    "if the hard - scattering cross section depends on more than one scale , then the choice of factorization scale becomes an even murkier issue .",
    "one argument against trying to do better than simply choosing @xmath6 ( we use @xmath7 to denote order - of - magnitude equality ) goes as follows .",
    "since the hadronic cross section is a physical quantity that does not depend on any factorization scale , the factorization scale is unphysical , and therefore one can not make a physical argument for its choice .",
    "it is in part due to arguments such as this that there has been little effort to try to do better than choosing @xmath6 .    on the other hand",
    ", the statement is often made that the factorization scale separates the short - distance physics of the hard - scattering cross section from the long - distance hadronic physics @xcite .",
    "the qualitative statement made earlier , that @xmath0 corresponds to the resolution with which the hadron is probed , falls into this class .",
    "this is contrary to the attitude that the factorization scale is unphysical .    in this paper",
    "we put forward a physical argument for the choice of factorization scale .",
    "we restrict our attention to drell - yan production , but the argument can and hopefully will be extended to other processes in the future .    the physical argument we advance is that the factorization scale should be chosen such that collinear ( long - distance ) physics is included in the parton distribution functions , and noncollinear ( short - distance ) physics in the hard - scattering cross section .",
    "this is not a new idea , and goes back to the origins of the parton model .",
    "what is new is the implementation of this idea in practice .",
    "we introduce a new factorization scheme , which we dub the collinear scheme , in which the factorization scale corresponds to a collinear cutoff .",
    "we then argue for a method to choose the factorization scale in that scheme .",
    "the method we pursue here was first proposed in the context of higgs - boson production in association with bottom quarks @xcite , and was refined and elaborated upon in ref .",
    "an alternative approach in the same spirit has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "all of the above studies are in the context of higgs - boson ( both charged and neutral ) production via a bottom - quark distribution function , which is a rather exotic process , both in the initial and the final state .",
    "however , the ideas developed there are of general validity , and should be applicable to all parton - model calculations . in this paper",
    "we further develop the method of ref .",
    "@xcite and apply it to one of the most basic processes of perturbative qcd , namely drell - yan production @xcite .",
    "our hope is that this method can be generalized to all parton - model calculations , finally satisfying the desire for a systematic method of factorization - scale choice .",
    "the parton distribution functions are evolved from one factorization scale to another via the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equations .",
    "these equations sum collinear logarithms into the parton distribution functions . in this section",
