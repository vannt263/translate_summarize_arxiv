    "the energy gain arises , of course , from the rotational energy of the kerr black hole that absorbs the negative energy particle .",

    "recent interest in this process arose when banados et al .",
    "@xcite noticed that the energy in the cm frame diverges in some collisions that take place near the horizon of an extreme kerr black hole .",
    "it was suggested that this infinite energy could be utilized to accelerate particles to extremely large energies or produce exotic massive particles that can not be produced otherwise .",
    "however , while the energy in the cm is extremely large , this study @xcite and many subsequent ones ignored the requirement that the resulting energetic particle escapes to infinity .",
    "piran and shaham @xcite have shown that this requirement imposes stringent conditions on the dynamics , and is critical when estimating the maximal possible energy gain in this process .",
    "they provided implicit estimates of the energies of the escaping particles under various conditions .",
    "detailed numerical studies @xcite have refined some of the earlier analysis of penrose collisions .",
    "these studies have shown that the maximal energy gain is , at most , a few times the energy of the infalling particles and the efficiency is modest .",
    "when two infalling particles collide near the horizon , their cm has an enormous negative radial momentum .",
    "hence , most of the particles produced in such collisions will also move inwards and fall into the black hole .",
    "only a small fraction will escape , and those have to climb out of the black hole s potential well and reach infinity only with modest energies .",
    "while both particles are initially infalling from infinity , it is possible that one of those has turned around the black hole and is on an outgoing trajectory @xcite .",
    "this reduces somewhat the magnitude of the negative radial momentum ( but it is insufficient to change its sign ) , and as such the maximal possible energy in such a collision is larger than that of the case where both particles are infalling . both @xcite and @xcite used numerical methods to explore fully - equatorial collisions , in which both incident and ejected particles are constrained to move within the equatorial plane .",
    "as we show later , the numerical limit obtained by @xcite can be surpassed by a non - equatorial collision , while that obtained by @xcite is valid also for the general case .",
    "here we consider general collisions of particles infalling from infinity that result in an escaping particle .",
    "we obtain a general analytic formula for the maximal energy of the escaping particle .",
    "the formula is also valid outside of the equatorial plane .",
    "it can also be easily generalized to the case of a collision involving an arbitrary number of incident or ejected particles .",
    "we explore the implications of this formula for several possible scenarios : pair annihilation , the elastic scattering of two massive particles , and the scattering of a photon by a massive particle ( e.g. compton scattering ) .",
    "we are interested in the maximal energy of the escaping particles and in the efficiency of the process , defined as the ratio of the energy of the escaping particle to the sum of the energies of the incident particles , and we focus on the maximal efficiency or , correspondingly , on the maximal energy gain .    as orbits in the kerr metric are essential for our study , we begin in  2 [ sec : orbits ] with a quick recapitulation of the relevant properties of these orbits . we continue in  3 [ sec : general ] with an examination of collisions , and derive the formula describing the energy of a particle produced by a general collision .",
    "we first discuss the general case , then provide simplified results for collisions wherein all particles are constrained to the equatorial plane .",
    "we examine in  4 [ sec : scenarios ] the implications for annihilation , elastic scattering and compton - like scattering for both equatorial and non - equatorial collisions . in all cases",
    "we discuss both the case in which the two incident particles are ingoing , and the case in which one of them has turned around the black hole and is outgoing .",

    "@xmath230- the maximal efficiency is attained for @xmath231 @xmath232- the maximal efficiency is attained for @xmath233",
    "we have obtained a general formula for the maximal energy of a particle that escapes to infinity following a collisional penrose process @xcite . we have considered a maximal ( @xmath30 ) kerr black hole , for which the highest energies are attainable .",
    "we have applied this formula to several cases , and in particular to the annihilation of two particles falling from rest at infinity and to the scattering of a massless particle by a massive one falling from rest at infinity . in all cases ,",
    "the maximal energy is obtained when one of the particles is  critical \" , namely it has a critical ratio of angular momentum to energy @xmath234 , and hence a turning point on @xmath44 .",
    "the energy of the escaping particle , ( 3 ) , in the @xmath205 limit , depends only on the properties of the critical particle ( 1 ) .    even though the cm energy of these near - horizon collisions diverges , the maximal energy of the escaping particles is always finite and rather modest . for the annihilation of ingoing particles ,",
    "the maximal energy is @xmath235 for the case of an escaping photon and slightly lower ( @xmath236 ) for an escaping massive particle .",
    "the corresponding energy gains , @xmath237 , are larger than those obtained by @xcite for fully- equatorial collisions by a factor of 9 , and are almost comparable to those obtained by @xcite for the annihilation of an ingoing particle with a particle that has turned around the black hole .    interestingly , even though the maximal energy is obtained for collisions that take place in the equatorial plane and the escaping particle is always constrained to the equatorial plane , these values are larger than those obtained for a fully - equatorial collisions , in which the colliding particles also move in the equatorial plane .",
    "this happens because , in this case , when the colliding particles are both ingoing and are not constrained to the equatorial plane , the maximal cm energy is larger(see eq . [ m2max1a ] ) than that obtained if both particles move in the equatorial plane .",
    "if the critical particle has turned around the black hole and is outgoing , the maximal energy is larger : @xmath238 if the escaping particle is a photon , and slightly lower @xmath239 , if it is a massive particle . in this case , the cm energy is maximal when the collision is fully - equatorial(eq .",
    "[ m2max2a ] ) , and hence our result agrees with the fully - equatorial numerical result obtained earlier by @xcite .",
    "the closest analytical results are due to harada et al .",
    "@xcite , who used a power - series expansion of the radial momentum equation ( eq . [ eq : prc ] ) to obtain the efficiency of a fully - equatorial collision taking place directly on the horizon , where particle ( 1 ) is ingoing .",
    "under these assumptions , our eq .",
    "[ eq : efor1 ] reduces to their 4.12 .",
    "since the fully - equatorial case maximizes only the `` @xmath240 '' cases , which were not considered by @xcite , our upper bounds do not coincide with theirs .    in the case where the escaping particle is massive",
    ", an additional kinematic condition exists : the mass of the particle must be smaller than the cm energy of the system .",
    "however , a more important bound is that to reach infinity @xmath241 .",
    "this poses a strong limit on the maximal masses of the escaping particles : @xmath242 and @xmath243 for an ingoing and outgoing critical incident particle , respectively .",
    "this implies that , while the cm energy diverges when the colliding particles have suitable momenta and the collision takes place near the horizon , even if an exotic massive particle will be produced in such a collision , it wo nt be able to escape and reach an observer at infinity .    the highest efficiency of the collisional penrose process , among the processes that we considered , is obtained for the scattering of an outgoing critical massless particle by a massive particle",
    ". the escaping particle can be either massless or massive . in the limit where the energy of the incident massless particle is very large , the efficiency of the process approaches @xmath244 this is an upper bound on any collisional penrose process involving particles that have originated at infinity .",
    "our method can be used to solve more general problems than those considered here . specifically , we focused on the global maximal energy of the escaping particle , and the special case of two particles falling from infinity .",
    "we stress that there is nothing special about the case of two - particle collisions .",
    "[ eq : e3 ] depends only on the total energy and momenta of the incident particles . as such",
    ", it can be used for any combination of incident particles , and even for the original penrose process in which a single particle disintegrates within the ergosphere .",
    "more generally , we can consider different initial momenta than those we considered here and , while our discussion focused on the case that the incident particles fall from rest from infinity , one can use our formalism for more general cases .",
    "we simply follow the same procedure , maximizing @xmath100 over different choices of @xmath245 and @xmath246 for a given set of parameters .",
    "this would allow us to obtain the local maxima of the energy for specific collisions .",
    "for example , we have used this method in @xcite to estimate the maximal efficiency in a specific collision suggested by berti et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when considering more general initial conditions for the incident particle one should , however , proceed with caution .",
    "not all parameters that are mathematically allowed at a given point ( @xmath247 ) are physically reasonable .",
    "specifically , there is a region in the phase space of allowed momenta in which the particles must have emerged from the black hole ( or generated somehow very close to the horizon on an outgoing orbit ) .",
    "this was first considered by berti et al .",
    "@xcite , who treated the case where both incident particles are sub - critical , and yet one of them is outgoing .",
    "since there are no turning points within the ergosphere for such particles , their radial momentum does nt have to be small and , unsurprisingly , such collisions can result in diverging energies .",
    "however , the outgoing sub - critical particle can not have originated at infinity(see fig .",
    "[ fig : b_a1 ] ) .",
    "as it can not have emerged from the black hole , it must therefore have been produced within the ergosphere , very near to the black hole s horizon .",
    "berti et al . suggested that this particle is produced in a prior collision of two particles infalling from infinity . while kinematically allowed , this now changes the overall energy budget .",
    "when the energy of these infalling particles is taken into account in the estimates of the overall efficiency of the process , the resulting efficiency reduces back to schnittman - like levels .",
    "thus , even though this is an unlikely configuration , involving two fine - tuned collisions that take place infinitely close to the black hole s horizon , this does not result in any extra gain in energy or efficiency when compared with simpler collisions .    to conclude , we discuss briefly the astrophysical and  technological \" implications of our findings .",
    "we have shown that under extreme conditions ( @xmath248 ) a collision can result in a particle that escapes to infinity with energy of a factor of a few ( up to about an order of magnitude ) larger than the energies of the incident particles .",
    "this is clearly a penrose process , as the energy must come from the rotational energy of the black hole .",
    "while this is a significant energy gain , this result rules out two ideas that gained ( unjustified ) popularity recently .",
    "the first is that , with the possibility of diverging cm energies in such collisions , supermassive black holes can accelerate , in this way , the observed ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) that are detected at up to @xmath249ev .",
    "there is no way that a proton or a nuclei will be accelerated to such energies and escape from the vicinity of the black hole .",
    "a second idea that was put forward was that , with diverging cm energies , such collisions could produce exotic massive particles that can not be produced otherwise , and as such could be used to explore physics that can not otherwise be explored .",
    "however , as one can see from the maximal rest masses derived ( see table 2 ) , such particles , if produced , wo nt be able to escape to an observer at infinity .    in this work we focused on the maximal possible energies in different collisions .",
    "these values are attained for an idealized situation of a maximally rotating black hole and for fine - tuned collisions taking place infinitely close to the horizon .",
    "any deviation from these idealized condition will drastically reduce the resulting energies .",
    "we did nt address the interesting astrophysical question of the likelihood of such collisions to take place .",
    "still , examination of figs .",
    "[ fig : annihilation ] , [ fig : annihilations ] and [ fig : asymp ] reveals that to be effective , such collisions must be extremely close to the event horizon .",
    "this implies that the effective geometrical cross section of the regions in which such collisions would take place is extremely small .",
    "furthermore , the angular momentum of one of the particles must be extremely close to the critical value .",
    "thus , the chances of having relevant collisions are extremely small .",
    "a final issue that we do nt address at all is the differential cross section - that is , the fraction of the angular phase space of the scattered particle in which energy gain is significant and the particle escapes .",
    "we suspect that the combination of all these constraints makes it unlikely that these collisions play an important role in either particle acceleration , particle production or energy extraction in either astrophysical or  technological \" systems .",
