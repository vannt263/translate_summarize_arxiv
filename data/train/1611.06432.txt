    "the quiet sun covers most of the solar surface , in particular at activity minimum , but also plays an important role even during the active phase of the solar cycle .",
    "the magnetic field in the quiet sun is constituted of the network @xcite , internetwork ( in , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the ephemeral regions @xcite . for an overview on the small - scale magnetic features , see .",
    "the in features are observed within the supergranular cells and carry hecto - gauss fields although kilo - gauss fields have also been observed in the in @xcite .",
    "they evolve as unipolar and bipolar features with typical lifetimes of less than 10 minutes @xcite , i.e. , they continuously bring new flux to the solar surface , either flux that has been freshly generated , or recycled .",
    "they carry fluxes @xmath4 mx , with the lower limit on the smallest flux decreasing with the increasing spatial resolution and polarimetric sensitivity of the observing instruments , although the identification technique also plays an important role .",
    "ephemeral regions are bipolar magnetic features appearing within the supergranular cells carrying fluxes @xmath5 mx @xcite and are much longer lived compared to the in features , with lifetimes of 3  4.4 hours @xcite .",
    "the ephemeral regions also bring new magnetic flux to the solar surface .",
    "the network is more stable , with typical lifetimes of the network structure of a few hours to a day , although the individual kg magnetic elements within the network live for a much shorter time , as the entire flux within the network is exchanged within a period of 824 hr @xcite .",
    "the flux in the network is fed by ephemeral regions @xcite and in features @xcite .",
    "the network features are found along the supergranular boundaries and carry fields of kilo - gauss strength with a typical flux of @xmath6 mx @xcite .",
    "the magnetic flux is produced by a dynamo , the location of which is currently the subject of debate , as is whether there is only a single dynamo acting in the sun or if there is a small - scale dynamo acting in addition to a global dynamo .",
    "in addition , it is unclear if all the magnetic flux appearing on the sun is actually new flux produced by a dynamo , or possibly recycled flux transported under the surface to a new location , where it appears again ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * )",
    ". this may be particularly important at the smallest scales .",
    "an important parameter constraining the production of magnetic flux is the amount of magnetic flux appearing at the solar surface .",
    "in particular , the emergence of magnetic flux at very small scales in the quiet sun provides a probe for a possible small - scale dynamo acting at or not very far below the solar surface .",
    "the deep minimum between solar cycles 23 and 24 offered a particularly good chance to study such flux emergence , as the long absence of almost any activity would suggest that most of the emerging flux is newly produced one and is not flux transported from decaying active regions to the quiet sun ( although the recycling of some flux from ephemeral regions can not be ruled out ) .",
    "the in quiet sun displays by far the largest magnetic flux emergence rate ( fer ) . already , @xcite pointed out that two orders of magnitude more flux appears in ephemeral regions than in active region , while the fer in the in is another two orders of magnitude larger .",
    "this result is supported by more recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the huge emergence rate of the magnetic flux in the in , it is of prime importance to measure the amount of flux that is brought to the surface by these features .",
    "the current estimates of the fer in the in vary over a wide range , which include : @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath10 @xcite . by considering all the magnetic features ( small - scale features and active regions ) ,",

    "a detailed comparison of the fers from different works is presented section  [ s6 ] .    to estimate the fer , @xcite and @xcite considered features with fluxes @xmath15 mx , while @xcite and @xcite included features with fluxes as low as @xmath16 mx and @xmath17 mx ( m. goi , priv .",
    "comm . ) , respectively . however , with the launch of the balloon - borne sunrise observatory in 2009 @xcite carrying the imaging magnetograph experiment ( imax , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has now become possible to estimate the fer including the contribution of in features with fluxes as low as @xmath0 mx ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter referred to as lsa16 ) .",
    "the imax instrument has provided unprecedented high - resolution magnetograms of the quiet sun observed at 5250  .",
    "the high resolution is the main reason for the lower limiting flux .",
    "a detailed statistical analysis of the in features observed in stokes @xmath18 recorded by sunrise / imax is carried out in lsa16 . in the present paper",
    "we estimate the fer in the in region using the same data .    in section  [ s2 ]",
    "we briefly describe the employed sunrise data .",
    "the in features bringing flux to the solar surface that are considered in the estimation of fer are outlined in section  [ s3 ] .",
    "the fer from sunrise are presented , discussed and compared with previously obtained results in section  [ s4 ] while our conclusions are presented in section  [ s8 ] .",
    "the data used here were obtained during the first science flight of sunrise described by @xcite .",
    "we consider 42 maps of the line - of - sight ( los ) magnetic field , @xmath19 , obtained from sets of images in the four stokes parameters recorded with the imax instrument between 00:36 and 00:59 ut on 2009 june 9 at the solar disk center , with a cadence of 33s , a spatial resolution of @xmath20 ( plate scale is @xmath21 per pixel ) , and an effective field of view ( fov ) of @xmath22 after phase diversity reconstruction .",
    "the data were reconstructed with a point spread function determined by in - flight phase diversity measurements to correct for the low - order aberrations of the telescope ( defocus , coma , astigmatism , etc .",
    ", see * ? ? ?",
    "the instrumental noise of the reconstructed data was @xmath23 in units of continuum intensity .",
    "for identification of the features , spectral averaging was done which further reduced the noise to @xmath24 . all features with signals above a @xmath25 threshold , which corresponds to 12 g , were used @xcite .    to measure the flux , we use @xmath19 determined with the center - of - gravity ( cog ) method .",
    "the inclination of the in fields has been under debate , with several studies dedicated to measuring their angular distribution . by analysing the data from _ hinode _",
    ", @xcite concluded the in fields to be predominantly horizontal .",
    "however , using the same dataset , @xcite found some of the in fields to be vertical",
    ". arrived at similar conclusions ( vertical inclination ) by analysing the magnetic bright points observed from the first flight of sunrise .",
    "variations in the inclination of the in fields with heliocentric angle ( @xmath26 ) has been reported by .",
    "isotropic and quasi - isotropic distribution of the in field inclinations is favoured by , using the fe i @xmath27 m infrared lines , and by using _",
    "more recently , found the distribution of in field inclination to be quasi - isotropic by applying 2d inversions on _ hinode _ data and comparing them with 3d magnetohydrodynamic simulations .",
    "for a detailed review on this , see @xcite .    in the determination of the fer , we use @xmath19 for consistency and for easier comparison with earlier studies on the fer . also , the determination of the exact amount of flux carried in horizontal field features is non - trivial and requires estimates of the vertical thickness of these features and the variation of their field strength with height .",
    "in addition , if they are loop - like structures , then there is the danger of counting the flux multiple times if one or both of their footpoints happen to be resolved by the sunrise data .",
    "we avoid this by considering only the vertical component of the magnetic field .",
    "it is likely that we miss the flux carried by unresolved magnetic loops by concentrating on stokes @xmath18 , but this problem is suffered by all previous studies of fer and should decrease as the spatial resolution of the observations is increased . with the sunrise i data analyzed here having the highest resolution , we expect them to see more of the flux in the footpoints of the very small - scale loops that appear as horizontal fields in _ hinode _ and sunrise data .",
    "the small - scale features were identified and tracked using the feature tracking code developed in lsa16 . for the sake of completeness",
    "we summarize the most relevant results from lsa16 in the following .",
    "all the features covering at least 5 pixels were considered with stokes @xmath18 being larger than @xmath25 in each pixel . to determine the flux per feature , the @xmath19 averaged over the feature , denoted as @xmath19 was used .",
    "@xmath19 has values up to 200 g , even when the maximum field strength in the core of the feature reached kg values .",
    "a total of 50255 features of both polarities were identified .",
    "the sizes of the features varied from 5 - 1585 pixels , corresponding to an area range of @xmath28mm@xmath29 .",
    "the tracked features had lifetimes ranging from 0.5513.2 minutes .",
    "the smallest detected flux of a feature was @xmath0 mx and the largest , @xmath30 mx .    at the time of the flight of sunrise in 2009 the sun was extremely quiet , with no signs of activity on the solar disk .",
    "two sample magnetograms at 00:47 ut and 00:58 ut are shown in figure  [ magnetogram ] .",
    "most of the features in these maps are part of the in and in this paper , we determine the rate at which they bring flux to the solar surface .",
    "the different processes increasing the magnetic flux at the solar surface are schematically represented in figure  [ flux]a  [ flux]d . in the figure",
    ", @xmath31 refers to the flux of the feature at its birth and @xmath32 is the maximum flux that a feature attains over its lifetime . a typical evolution of the flux of a feature born by unipolar or bipolar appearances , and by splitting / merging is shown in figure  [ flux]e ( top and bottom , respectively ) .",
    "the gain in the flux of a feature after its birth is @xmath33 .",
    "magnetic flux at the surface increases through the following processes :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]    1 .",
    "unipolar appearance : the birth of an isolated feature with no spatial overlap with any of the existing features in the current and/or previous time frame ( figure  [ flux]a ) .",
    "2 .    bipolar appearance : birth of bipolar features , with the two polarities closely spaced , and either appearing simultaneously or separated by a couple of time frames ( referred to as time symmetric and asymmetric emergence in lsa16 ; see also figure  [ flux]b ) .",
    "flux gained by features in the course of their lifetime : the gain in the flux of a feature in the course of its lifetime , i.e. the increase in flux between its birth and the time it reaches its maximum flux , before dying in one way or another , either by interacting with another feature , or by disappearing .",
    "+ this gain can take place in features born in different ways , be it by growth , or through the merging or splitting of pre - existing features ( figures  [ flux]c , [ flux]d and [ flux]e ) .",
    "note that the bipolar appearance of magnetic flux is often referred to as ` emergence ' in earlier papers including lsa16 .",
    "however , the term ` emergence ' in fer describes the appearance of new flux at the solar surface from all the three processes described above . to avoid confusion , we refer to the emergence of bipolar features as bipolar appearance .",
    "of all the newly born features over the entire time series , 19056 features were unique ( for area ratio 10:1 , see section  [ s4 ] ) . among them",
    "48% ( 8728 features ) were unipolar and 2% ( 365 features ) were part of bipolar appearances .",
    "features born by splitting constituted 38% ( 6718 features ) , and 12% ( 2226 features ) were born by merging .",
    "the remaining 1019 features correspond to those alive in the first frame .",
    "a comparison of the rates of birth and death of the features by various processes for different area ratio criteria is given in table  2 of lsa16 .",
    "in the fer estimations , the flux brought by the features born by unipolar and bipolar appearances is the maximum flux that they attain ( @xmath32 ) over their lifetime . in the case of features born by splitting or merging ,",
    "the flux gained after birth is taken as the flux brought by them to the surface .",
    "this gain is the difference between their flux at birth @xmath31 and the maximum flux they attain @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "our approach is conservative in the sense that if a feature reaches multiple peaks of flux in the course of its lifetime , an example shown in figure  [ fg ] , then we consider only the largest one ( the flux gained during the first peak in figure  [ fg ] ) , and neglect increases in flux contributing to smaller peaks such as the 2nd and 3rd peaks in figure  [ fg ] .",
    "multiple peaks in the flux of a feature ( shown in figure  [ fg ] ) are rarely seen , as most features do not live long enough to display them ( see lsa16 ) .",
    "changes in the flux of a feature in the course of its lifetime can cause it to seemingly appear and disappear with time if its total flux is close to the threshold set in the study ( given by a signal level twice the noise in at least 5 contiguous pixels ) .",
    "if it disappears and reappears again , then it will be counted twice .",
    "this introduces uncertainties in the measurement of fer .",
    "uncertainties are discussed in section  [ s7 ] .",
    "in this work , we consider the results from the area ratio criterion 10:1 of lsa16 . in that paper , the authors devise area ratio criteria ( 10:1 , 5:1 , 3:1 and 2:1 ) to avoid that a feature dies each and every time that a tiny feature breaks off , or merges with it .",
    "for example in a splitting event , the largest of the features formed by splitting must have an area less than @xmath35 times the area of the second largest , under the @xmath36 area ratio criterion .",
    "we have verified that the choice of the area ratio criteria does not drastically alter the estimated fer , with variations being less than 10% for area ratios varying between 10:1 and 2:1 .",
    "the instantaneous and maximum fluxes of the features in different processes are given in tables  @xmath37 of lsa16 .",
    "a summary is repeated in table  [ table1 ] for convenience , where fluxes are given for features born by the 4 processes listed in the first column .",
    "the instantaneous flux , in the second column , refers to the flux of a feature at its birth ( @xmath31 in figure  [ flux ] ) . in the third column",
    "is the maximum flux of a feature during its lifetime ( @xmath32 in figure  [ flux ] ) .",
    "the flux gain in the fourth column is the difference of the second and third columns ( @xmath38 ) . in the fifth column",
    "is the factor by which the flux increases from its birth to its peak ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the fluxes given in this table are the sum total over all features in the entire time series , for each process .    to compute the fer",
    ", we add the fluxes from the various processes described in the previous section . for features born by appearance ( unipolar and bipolar )",
    ", we take the maximum flux of the features ( @xmath32 ) to be the fresh flux emerging at the surface . for the features formed by merging or splitting only the flux increase after the birth ( @xmath40 )",
    "is considered . from the first two processes alone , the total flux brought to the surface",
    "is @xmath41 mx over a fov of @xmath42 in 22.5 minutes .",
    "this gives an fer of @xmath43 . including the flux gained by split / merged features increases the fer to @xmath44 .",
    "figure  [ flux1 ] shows the contribution from each process to the total fer .",
    "the isolated features appearing on the solar surface contribute the largest , nearly 60% .",
    "given that the emerging bipoles contain only 2% of the total observed flux ( table  5 in lsa16 ) , they contribute only about 5.7% to the fer .",
    "however , the flux brought to the solar surface by features born by splitting or merging , after their birth is @xmath45 mx , which is quite significant and contributes @xmath46 to the fer .",
    "the contribution to solar surface flux by this process is comparable to the flux brought to the surface by features born by unipolar appearance ( @xmath47 mx ) and nearly an order of magnitude higher than the flux from features born by bipolar appearance ( @xmath48 mx ) .    over their lifetimes , the features born by splitting and by merging gain 1.2 times their initial flux ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) .",
    "the fluxes gained by features born by appearance relative to their flux at birth is slightly higher ( @xmath50 times , i.e. , @xmath51 ) .",
    "this is because the initial magnetic flux of the features born by appearance is quite low .",
    "the flux at birth of split or merged features , is already quite high because the parent features which undergo splitting or merging are at later stages in their lives ( see figure  [ flux]e ) .",
    "this is also evident from the fact that the average initial flux per feature of the features born by splitting or merging ( @xmath52 mx and @xmath53 mx , respectively ) is an order of magnitude higher than the average initial flux per feature of the appeared unipolar or bipolar features ( @xmath54 mx , see table  2 of lsa16 ) .     in figures  [ flux]c , [ flux]d and [ flux]e . ]",
    "the fact that the small - scale magnetic features are the dominant source of fresh flux in the quiet photosphere is discussed in several publications @xcite .",
    "our results extend these earlier findings to lower flux per feature values .",
    "as shown in figure  [ hist ] , over the range @xmath1 mx , nearly @xmath55 of the detected features carry a flux @xmath56 mx ( left panel ) .",
    "they are also the dominant contributors to the fer ( right panel ) . in this figure ,",
    "only the features that are born by unipolar and bipolar appearances are considered . below @xmath57 mx",
    ", we see a drop as we approach the sensitivity limit of the instrument .",
    "the flux is lost from the solar surface by disappearance , cancellation of opposite polarity features , and decrease in the flux of the features in the course of their evolution ( i.e. the opposite process to the `` flux gain '' described earlier in section  [ s3 ] ) . as seen from tables  3 and 4 of lsa16 , the increase in flux at the solar surface balances the loss of flux , as it obviously must if the total amount of flux is to remain unchanged . to compute the flux loss rate ,",
    "we take the maximum flux of the features that die by cancellation and by disappearance to be the flux lost by them in the course of their lifetime and during disappearance or cancellation . for the features that die by splitting",
    "/ merging we take the difference between the maximum flux of the features and the flux at their death as a measure of the flux lost during their lifetimes . by repeating the analyses for the 10:1 area ratio criterion , we find that the flux is lost from the solar surface at a rate of 1150@xmath58 which corresponds within 4.5% to the obtained fer .",
    "this agreement serves as a consistency check of the fer value that we find .",
    "although most of the uncertainties and ambiguities that arise during feature tracking have been carefully taken care of , as discussed in lsa16 , some additional ones which can affect the estimated fer are addressed below .    in our computation of the fer ,",
    "the features born before the time series began and the features still alive at the end are not considered .",
    "according to lsa16 , the first and the last frames of the time series had 1019 and 1277 features , respectively . to estimate their contribution",
    ", we assume that the features still living at the end have a similar lifetime , size , flux distribution and formation mechanism as the total number of features studied .",
    "we attribute the appropriate average flux at birth and the average flux gain for features born by splitting , merging , unipolar and bipolar appearance . after including these additional fluxes , we get an fer of @xmath59 , corresponding to a @xmath60 increase . with this method",
    ", we are associating the features with flux gain than they might actually contribute ( as many of them are likely to reach their maximum flux only after the end of the time series ) .",
    "this will be balanced out by not considering the features that are already alive at the beginning ( also , it is impossible to determine the birth mechanism of these features ) .",
    "furthermore , in the analysis of lsa16 , the features touching the spatial boundaries were not counted .",
    "an estimate of their contribution , in ways similar to the above , leads to a further increase of the fer by @xmath61 . thus combining the features in the first and last frames and the features touching spatial boundaries together",
    "increase the fer by @xmath62 .    meanwhile , as discussed in section  [ s3 ] , in the case of flux gained after birth by features born from splitting or merging , we consider only the gain to reach the maximum flux in the feature and not the smaller gains required to reach secondary maximum of flux in the feature , if any ( see figure  [ fg ] ) .",
    "these instances are quite rare .",
    "to estimate their contribution , we consider all features living for at least four minutes ( eight time steps ) so as to distinguish changes in flux from noise fluctuations .",
    "they constitute a small fraction of @xmath63 .",
    "if all these features are assumed to show two maxima of equal strength , then they increase the fer by @xmath64 .",
    "this is a generous estimate and both these assumptions are unlikely to be met .",
    "however this is balanced out by not considering the features that have more than two maxima .",
    "thus the increase in fer is quite minor .    additionally , some of the features identified in a given time frame could disappear , i.e. drop below the noise level , for the next couple of frames , only to reappear after that .",
    "this is unlikely to happen due to the thermal or mechanical changes for the sunrise observatory , flying in a highly stable environment at float altitude , and with active thermal control of critical elements in the imax instrument . as mentioned in section  [ s3 ]",
    ", the appearance and disappearance of features could also occur due to the applied threshold on the signal levels . in our analyses ,",
    "the reappeared features are treated as newly appeared .",
    "this leads to a higher estimation of the fer .",
    "@xcite have estimated that accounting for reappeared features decreases the fer by nearly @xmath65 .",
    "if we assume the same amount of decrease in the fer from the reappeared features in our dataset , then we finally obtain an fer of 1100@xmath66 .",
    "below , we compare our results from sunrise data with those from the _ hinode _ observations analysed in three recent publications .",
    "although all these papers use observations from the same instrument , they reach very different estimates of fers . the important distinguishing factor between them",
    "is the method that is used to identify the magnetic features and to calculate the fer .",
    "for comparison we summarize the main result that we have obtained here .",
    "we find that in the quiet sun ( composed dominantly of the in ) the fer is @xmath67 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath68 under the assumption that the whole sun is as quiet as the very tranquil sunrise / imax fov .",
    "according to @xcite , the flux appearance or emergence rate in the in region is @xmath69 , which corresponds to @xmath70 over the whole surface and the contribution from the in is assumed to be @xmath71 .",
    "the authors track individual features and measure their fluxes , which is similar to the method used in lsa16 .",
    "their estimate is an order of magnitude lower than the fer obtained in the present paper .",
    "this difference can be explained by the higher spatial resolution of sunrise compared to _",
    "the isolated magnetic feature with the smallest flux detected in sunrise / imax data is @xmath0 mx ( see lsa16 ) , which is nearly an order of magnitude smaller than the limit of @xmath17 mx ( m. goi , priv .",
    "comm . ) , underlying the analysis of @xcite .",
    "additionally , the imax data are recorded with 33s cadence , while the two data sets analysed by the above authors have cadences of 60 and 90s each .",
    "a higher cadence helps in better tracking of the evolution of features and their fluxes .",
    "also , a significant number of the very short - lived features that we find may have been missed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite , also using _ hinode _ observations , estimate the fer by fitting a power law to the distribution of frequency of emergence ( @xmath72 ) over a wide range of fluxes ( @xmath73 mx , which covers both , small - scale features as well as active regions ) .",
    "it is shown that a single power law index of -2.7 can fit the entire range .",
    "depending on the different emergence detection methods used and described by these authors , such as bipole comparison ( bc ) , tracked bipolar ( tb ) and tracked cluster ( tc ) , the authors find a wide range of fers from 32 to @xmath74 which correspond to 2.0 to @xmath75 over the whole solar surface ( table 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to match their results from _ hinode _ with other studies , the authors choose an fer of @xmath76 , from the higher end of the range ( c. parnell , priv .",
    "this is nearly four times higher than the value quoted in @xcite , who also used the _ hinode _ observations and a smaller minimum flux per feature , so that they should in principle have caught more emerging features .",
    "however @xcite , using a power law distribution similar to @xcite and a slightly different index of -2.5 , estimates an fer of @xmath77 . a possible reason for this difference ,",
    "as briefly discussed in both these studies , could be the different feature tracking and identification methods used . in @xcite , all the features identified by bc , tb and tc methods are considered in determining the fer . according to the authors , the bc method counts the same feature multiple times and over - estimates the rate of flux emergence .",
    "however in @xcite , only the features tracked by tb method are used .",
    "the large differences in the fers from the three detection methods quoted in table  2 of @xcite , supports this line of reasoning .",
    "the fer in @xcite is roughly half that found by @xcite and hence is at least in qualitative agreement .",
    "the fer estimated by us is 2.5 times higher than the largest value obtained by @xcite and 17 times higher than that of @xcite .",
    "another recent estimate of the fer is by @xcite . using _",
    "hinode _ observations , they estimate that the in fields contribute up to @xmath78 to the solar surface .",
    "this is an order of magnitude higher than the global fer of @xmath79 published by @xcite and is two orders of magnitude higher than the @xmath80 obtained by @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it is assumed that every three minutes , the in features replenish the flux at the solar surface with an average flux density of 12.4 g ( @xmath81 . here , three minutes is taken as the average lifetime of the in features @xcite .",
    "their fer is nearly six times higher than our estimate , although the lowest flux per feature to which _",
    "hinode_/sot is sensitive is significantly larger than for sunrise / imax ( due to the lower spatial resolution of the former ) . to understand this difference",
    ", we applied the method of @xcite to the sunrise / imax observations . from the entire time series , the total sum of the flux in all features with flux @xmath82 mx is @xmath83mx over an area of @xmath84@xmath85 .",
    "this gives us an average flux density of 2.8 g , which is 4.5 times smaller than 12.4 g of @xcite .",
    "if the in features are assumed to have an average lifetime of three minutes , similar to @xcite , then fer over the whole solar surface is @xmath86mxday@xmath87 .",
    "this is 1.2 times higher than our original estimate from the feature tracking method .",
    "if instead , we take the average lifetime of the features in our dataset from first appearance to final disappearance at the surface of @xmath88 minutes , we get an fer of @xmath89mxday@xmath87 , nearly 1.9 times higher than our original estimate and still 2.8 times smaller than @xcite .",
    "this is longer than 1.1 minute quoted in lsa16 , which includes death of a feature by splitting or merging ( see lsa16 ) , i.e. processes that do not remove flux from the solar surface .    to be sure that the problem does not lie in the cog technique employed here",
    ", we also estimated the average flux density by considering the @xmath19 from the recently available inversions of the sunrise data @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 values returned by the inversions differ from those given by the cog technique by about 5% on average ( individual pixels show much larger differences , of course ) , so that this can not explain the difference to the value adopted by @xcite .",
    "if all the pixels , including noise , are considered then the average flux density is 10.7 g .",
    "this is an absolute upper limit of the average flux density as a large part of it is due to noise and it is still lower than the in signal of 12.4 g , estimated by @xcite .",
    "thus the high value of fer from @xcite is at least partly due to their possibly too high value of average flux density .",
    "the observations analysed by these authors clearly show network and enhanced network features .",
    "if some of these are misidentified , then this would result in a higher average flux density .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then the estimate of the lifetime of 3 minutes may also be too short ( the technique of * ? ? ?",
    "* neglects any possible correlation between magnetic flux and lifetime of a feature ) .",
    "although the amount of flux in in fields is not expected to change significantly with time or place , this is not true for the amount of flux in the network , which changes significantly .",
    "e.g. , another time series taken by sunrise during its first flight , having slightly more network in the fov , is found to have an average @xmath19 of around 16 g ( including noise ) , which is higher than the 12.4 g used by @xcite .",
    "however , this is just a qualitative assessment and the very large fer found by @xcite needs to be probed quantitatively in a future study .",
    "in this paper , we have estimated the fer in the quiet sun from the in features using the observations from sunrise / imax recorded during its first science flight in 2009 .",
    "we have included the contribution from features with fluxes in the range @xmath90 mx , whose evolution was followed directly . by accounting for the three important processes that bring flux to the solar surface : unipolar and bipolar appearances , and flux gained after birth by features born by splitting or merging over their lifetime , we estimate an fer of @xmath91 . the third process is found to contribute significantly to the fer . the smaller features with fluxes @xmath92 mx bring most of the flux to the surface .",
    "since our studies include fluxes nearly an order of magnitude smaller than the smallest flux measured from the _ hinode _ data , our fer is also an order of magnitude higher when compared to studies using a similar technique ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "we compare also with other estimates of the fer in the literature .",
    "@xcite obtained a range of values .",
    "those near the lower end of the range ( also quoted by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are possibly the more reliable ones , are roughly consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "the high fer of @xmath93 found by @xcite is , however , difficult to reconcile with any other study .",
    "it is likely so high partly due to the excessively large @xmath19 of in fields of 12.4 g used by these authors , which is more than a factor of 4 times larger than the averaged @xmath19 of 2.8 g that we find .",
    "even the absolute upper limit of the spatially averaged @xmath19 in our data ( including noise ) is below the value used by @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect that they have overestimated the fer .",
    "there is clearly a need for further investigation , not only to quantify better the reasons for the different results obtained by different techniques .",
    "there are also still multiple open questions .",
    "what is the cause of the increase and decrease of the flux of a feature during its lifetime ?",
    "is this due to interaction with `` hidden '' flux ? is this hidden flux not visible because it is weak and thus below the noise threshold , or because it is structured at very small scales , i.e. it is below the spatial resolution ? how strongly does the `` hidden '' or missed flux change with changing spatial resolution ?",
    "the most promising approach to answer these and related questions is to study the flux evolution in an mhd simulation that includes a working small - scale turbulent dynamo .",
