    "the energies of tamm states lie in the forbidden gaps for the corresponding infinite kp model .",

    "however , an analytical demonstration of the existence of exact surface states is still absent  @xcite .",
    "for an example , to construct a surface state in the semi - infinite one - dimensional kp model , one need to calculate analytically or numerically a bloch wave of a complex wave number and then match it with an exponentially decaying state inside the surface potential  @xcite . in a semi - infinite sinusoidal potential  @xcite or a semi - infinite kp potential  @xcite , the energies and the wave numbers for the surface states are determined implicitly by solving a transcendental equation .",

    "surface states near an interface between a periodic layered medium and a homogeneous medium are found to be analogous to electronic surface states in crystals  @xcite .",
    "the formation of shockley - like surface states in an optically induced semi - infinite photonic superlattice has been experimentally demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "the formation of tamm states at the boundary between two periodical dielectric structures has been reported  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the nonreciprocality of the surface modes can be induced by the violation of periodicity and the violation of the time reversal symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the recent advances on surface states in photonic crystals are reviewed in  @xcite .    in this paper , for a kind of infinite bichromatic superlattices satisfying some certain conditions , we find a set of the in - gap states in superpositions of finite numbers of unstable bloch waves .",
    "these unstable in - gap states are then used to construct stable surface states for several typical systems of surface states , such as the semi - infinite photonic superlattice , the finite photonic superlattice , two directly coupled photonic superlattices , and two indirectly coupled photonic superlattices . the conditions for the existence of these surface states are derived .",
