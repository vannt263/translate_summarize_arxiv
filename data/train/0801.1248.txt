    "a key to understanding this result is that , owing to the competition between strain and diffusion , the vorticity in turbulent flows naturally forms into concentrated vortical structures .",

    "the anomalous alignment of the vorticity with respect to the eigenvectors of the total strain field is shown in that case to follow from a local switching of the principal strain axes when the vortex becomes sufficiently strong relative to the background strain .",

    "if larger @xmath2 and correspondingly higher orders @xmath5 are needed to obtain accurate evaluations of background strain rate fields , then otherwise identical approaches based on alternative expansions may be numerically advantageous .",
    "for instance , an expansion in terms of orthonormal basis functions allows the coefficients to be expressed as integrals over the vorticity field within @xmath182 , rather than as derivatives evaluated at the center point @xmath119 .",
    "( for example , wavelets have been used to test alignment between the strain rate eigenvectors and the vorticity gradient in two - dimensional turbulence @xcite . )",
    "this would allow a result analogous to ( [ bs18 ] ) that can be carried to higher orders with less sensitivity to discretization error .",
    "the key conclusion , however , of the present study is that it is possible to evaluate the background strain tensor following the general procedure developed herein , and that when such methods are applied to assess the background strain rate fields in turbulent flows they reveal a substantial increase in the expected alignment of the vorticity vector with the most extensional principal axis of the background strain rate field .",

    "<S> local and nonlocal contributions to the total strain rate tensor @xmath0 at any point @xmath1 in a flow are formulated from an expansion of the vorticity field in a local spherical neighborhood of radius @xmath2 centered on @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting exact expression allows the nonlocal ( background ) strain rate tensor @xmath3 to be obtained from @xmath4 . in turbulent flows , where the vorticity naturally concentrates into relatively compact structures , </S>",
    "<S> this allows the local alignment of vorticity with the most extensional principal axis of the background strain rate tensor to be evaluated . in the vicinity of any vortical structure , the required radius @xmath2 and corresponding order @xmath5 to which the expansion must be carried are determined by the viscous lengthscale @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the convergence to the background strain rate field with increasing @xmath2 and @xmath5 for an equilibrium burgers vortex , and show that this resolves the anomalous alignment of vorticity with the intermediate eigenvector of the total strain rate tensor . </S>",
    "<S> we then evaluate the background strain field @xmath3 in dns of homogeneous isotropic turbulence where , even for the limited @xmath2 and @xmath5 corresponding to the truncated series expansion , the results show an increase in the expected equilibrium alignment of vorticity with the most extensional principal axis of the background strain rate tensor . </S>"
