    "in recent years , experimental success in the engineering of high - quality micro - cavities with interactions between photons and atoms has opened up the possibility of using light - matter systems as quantum simulators for ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the simplest system of radiation - matter coupling is the interaction of a two - level atom with a single quantized mode of an optical cavity .",
    "an effective model for such interactions was proposed by jaynes and cummings ( jaynes - cummings model , jcm ) 50 years ago @xcite .",
    "recently , a generalization of the jcm has been proposed in order to approach photon - hopping between cavities in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "essentially , this generalization , called the jaynes - cummings - hubbard model ( jchm ) , describes the competition between the strong atom - photon coupling and the photon - hopping between cavities .",
    "in particular , a quantum phase diagram involving the transition from the mott insulator ( mi ) phase to the superfluid ( sf ) phase has been investigated using the jchm @xcite .",
    "the jcm can be exactly solved within the framework of rotating wave approximation @xcite .",
    "however , jchm does not yet have an analytical solution requiring approximation methods .",
    "mering @xcite proposed an approach which treats spin operators as fermionic , allowing theoreticians to solve jchm in momentum space using a fourier transform over the bosonic and fermionic operators .",
    "nonlinear optical effects are usually observed in an optical lattice @xcite . today , these effects have attracted significant interest due to the possibility of producing entangled states , an achievement particularly important to the field of quantum information @xcite .",
    "using optical lattices , highly applicable results have been obtained using the kerr effect @xcite .",
    "the kerr is an atomic third order effect that occurs in optical cavities @xcite , which is often overlooked in cavities of high quality .",
    "generally , it is important to investigate the consequences of its presence .",
    "studies involving jcm in the presence of the kerr effect have been performed , including obtaining the statistics of photons emitted from a cavity driven by an external laser source @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we investigate the jchm in kerr medium to optical chain to large size using the theoretical approach proposed by mering @xcite .",
    "we show that the presence of the kerr effect in optical lattices influences the transition from mi to sf , increasing critical hopping .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in",
    "we show the jaynes - cummings - hubbard - kerr model describing its effective hamiltonian .",
    "we introduce the fermionic approximation in . in we expose the results .",
    "finally , our conclusions are in .",
    "the hamiltonian of the jaynes - cummings - hubbard - kerr model ( jchkm ) to a chain of @xmath0 atoms is given by ( @xmath1 ) @xmath2 here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are pauli matrices , and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the light mode in the @xmath7th cavity with frequency @xmath8 .",
    "the frequency of the transition energy of the atoms is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the light - atom coupling is represented by @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the hopping integral between @xmath12th - neighboring cavities .",
    "the first four terms in hamiltonian represent the jchm , and the last one is the kerr term where @xmath13 is the constant related to the nonlinear response of the kerr medium @xcite .    for a large optical chain we can write @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the longitudinal and transversal frequencies of light , respectively , and @xmath19 is the mean equilibrium distance between cavities @xcite .",
    "when the hopping @xmath20 and kerr @xmath21 terms vanish , the hamiltonian is decoupled into @xmath0 independent jcm hamiltonians , which has well - known eigenstates @xcite . if @xmath22 , the system remains decoupled with the same eigenstates . however , when @xmath23 , the cavities become coupled , increasing the complexity of the solution due to the fact that we can not write the eigenstates of the whole system as a direct product of single - cavity eigenstates",
    "in this situation , an appropriate approach is the fermionic treatment @xcite followed by a mean field approximation that disregards the momentum transfer between photons in the kerr term .",
    "fermionic treatment consists in replacing the spin operators with fermionic ones .",
    "this approach produces exact results for the jcm .",
    "however , as observed in the previous section , the eigenstates of jchm are not a direct product of single - cavity jcm eigenstates . in this situation ,",
    "the present treatment is an approximation that has presented results very close to other methods such as the mean field approach @xcite .",
    "we can write hamiltonian as    @xmath24    where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) are replaced by fermionic operators @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) . assuming that the number of cavities is denoted by @xmath0 , and then performing a fourier transform , @xmath29 we find @xmath30 where @xmath31 $ ] .    due to the kerr term , the hamiltonian can not be written as a @xmath32 summation .",
    "subsequently , we employ a mean field approximation to decouple this term , assuming that @xmath33 or that , in other words , there is no momentum exchange . under these circumstances , we will see that the solution of the hamiltonian depends on self - consistent equations similar to the standard mean field approach .",
    "the last term of the hamiltonian is written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the photon - density operator of the system .",
    "therefore , in the large chain limit ( @xmath36 ) we can write the hamiltonian as @xmath37.\\ ] ] in which @xmath38 . because we are interested in obtaining transition points on the phase diagram , we employ the fact that , in the mi phase , the mean number of photons in the ground state , @xmath39 , is the same for all moments , and consequently @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "now , by the follow replacement method , @xmath41 , and we obtain @xmath42 , in which @xmath43 in this way , the system is decoupled and its eigenstates become direct products of the individual @xmath32 eigenstates , allowing us to study our system through hamiltonian .",
    "we assume the notation @xmath44 for the state with @xmath45 fermions and @xmath46 photons with @xmath32 momentum .",
    "note that the total number of excitations , @xmath47 , commutes with @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , we resorting to the basis @xmath49 because the total number of excitations is constant , and the ground state of the hamiltonian is given by @xmath50 in which @xmath51 and @xmath52    afterwards , it is relatively easy to find that the ground state energy of hamiltonian it is easy to find that the ground state energy of the hamiltonian is    @xmath53    now , we can compute the mean photon number in the ground state as follows @xmath54 the self - consistent mean field equation is closed by inserting in .    when hopping , the term is non - null in the jchm , and there is a transition between the mi and sf states @xcite .",
    "the equation allows us to investigate the influence of the kerr effect in this transition .",
    "and @xmath13 are given by .",
    "solid lines refer to @xmath55 while dashed ones are related to @xmath56 .",
    "note that when @xmath57 , the minimum disappears.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath13 are given by .",
    "solid lines refer to @xmath55 while dashed ones are related to @xmath56 .",
    "note that when @xmath57 , the minimum disappears.,title=\"fig : \" ]    and @xmath13 are given by .",
    "solid lines refer to @xmath55 while dashed ones are related to @xmath56 .",
    "note that when @xmath57 , the minimum disappears.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath13 are given by .",
    "solid lines refer to @xmath55 while dashed ones are related to @xmath56 .",
    "note that when @xmath57 , the minimum disappears.,title=\"fig : \" ]    shows how energy depends on @xmath32 .",
    "observe that for @xmath58 the energy has no dependence on @xmath32 .",
    "consequently , the photons are uniformly distributed in momentum space characterizing a mi phase , which has a gap between the chemical potentials of the particles and the hole @xcite .",
    "however , the gap is reduced as @xmath59 increases until it becomes null at a specific critical point , @xmath60 , appearing in the transition from the mi to sf phases .",
    "the chemical potential of the particle @xmath61 , while the hole s potential @xmath62 , where @xmath63 ( @xmath32 ) is the minimum ( maximum ) of energy . in , @xmath64 and @xmath65 or @xmath66 for any parameters @xmath67 and @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the chemical potentials are calculated through the following expressions @xmath68    the well - known feature of the mi - sf transition is the mott lobe which is exhibited in for some values of @xmath67 , @xmath9 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the plus ( minus ) sign in corresponds to the upper ( lower ) boundary of the mott lobe .",
    "the kerr effect produces a shift of mott lobes , which is emphasized as @xmath67 increases .",
    "this result is expected because the kerr term in hamiltonian has a @xmath69 dependence .",
    "the lobs are also shifted through changes in @xmath9 in agreement with the results of non - kerr models @xcite .",
    "when @xmath70 the lobe is closed at the critical point , @xmath60 , which depends on @xmath67 , @xmath13 and @xmath9 .     and ( b ) @xmath71 .",
    "ashed lines refer to @xmath21 while solid ones are related to @xmath72 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   and ( b ) @xmath71 .",
    "ashed lines refer to @xmath21 while solid ones are related to @xmath72 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]     to some @xmath13 values , and @xmath73 1 ( dotted lines ) , 3 ( solid lines ) , and 6 ( dashed lines ) . ]    the dependence of @xmath60 on @xmath9 for some values of @xmath67 and @xmath13 is exhibited in .",
    "note that @xmath60 decreases as @xmath9 increases meaning that critical hopping is smaller as atomic - level spacing increases .",
    "furthermore , the increase of @xmath67 reduces @xmath60 in accordance with non - kerr model results @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xmath60 increases with @xmath13 , and this behavior is amplified as large as @xmath67 , which is expected due to the @xmath69 dependence of the kerr term in hamiltonian .",
    "we have studied properties of the mi - sf transition on a long - range - hopping jchk chain through fermionic approximation followed by a mean field approach . despite the fact that the kerr effect be very small ( @xmath74 ,",
    "see ) and it causes negligible changes in the energy spectrum ( see ) , it significantly changes the properties of the transition ( see and ) .",
    "a similar feature had been exhibited in reference @xcite where it can be observed that changes in the photon hopping range influence slightly the energy spectrum while modifying significantly mi - sf transition properties .",
    "therefore , we wish to emphasize the importance of taking into account properties that induce small effects in the energy spectrum when the research focus is mi - sf transition properties .    this work was supported by capes , fapitec / se and cnpq ( brazilian agencies ) .",
