    "in recent years , precise radial velocity ( rv ) observation of stars and careful analysis of rv data have become relevant in astrophysics since the vast majority of the known extrasolar planets have been discovered using this method @xcite or have been confirmed this way when the planet itself was first detected as a transiting object around its host star @xcite . in the cases where there are no observable transits , the characterization of extrasolar planets relies on the radial velocity observations alone .",
    "moreover , observations of photometric transits in addition to radial velocity measurements constrain the mass of the planet ( instead of yielding only a lower limit ) , and provide more precise information on the epoch and period ; see e.g. the case of the low - mass transiting planet hat - p-11b @xcite , where the uncertainty in the epoch would be @xmath0 times larger if the analysis had relied only on radial velocity measurements .",
    "thus , incorporating constraints given by transit timings reduce the uncertainties in the rv amplitude and the orbital parameters ( e.g. , semimajor axis , eccentricity ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a set of analytic relations ( based on a few smooth functions defined in a closed form ) which provides a straightforward solution of kepler s problem , and consequently , time series of rv data and rv model functions . due to the analytic property ,",
    "the partial derivatives can also be obtained directly and therefore can be utilized in various fitting and data analysis methods , including , for instance , the fisher analysis of covariances , uncertainties and correlations .",
    "the functions presented here are nearly as simple to manage as trigonometric functions .    as an application",
    ", we give a detailed description about scheduling radial velocity measurements in the case of transiting extrasolar planets in order to derive accurate orbital eccentricity and/or detect the variations in the eccentricity .",
    "discussions related to this problem in the case of extrasolar planets with no additional constraints on their orbital motions other than rv data can be found in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "photometric measurements for transits constrain the orbital period and epoch much more precisely than pure rv observations .",
    "thus , for a given fixed eccentricity and argument of pericenter , the optimal time instances for rv observations depend only on the orbital phase . in the case of transiting planets",
    "the long - term variations in the orbital eccentricity @xmath1 and longitude of pericenter @xmath2 are quite relevant .",
    "the presented strategy focuses on the precise measurement of the lagrangian orbital elements @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( including the cases when the cicrular property is intended to be confirmed at high significance ) .    in section  [ sec : formalism ] , the basics of the mathematical formalism are presented , including the rules for calculating partial derivatives . in section  [ sec :",
    "miscformalism ] , the solution of the spatial problem is shown , supplemented with the inverse problem , still using infinitely differentiable functions . the spatial case discusses how the inclination and the argument of node should be incorporated in the formalism without loosing the analytic property while the inverse problem describes how the orbital elements are derived from the coordinates and velocities . in section  [ sec : applications ] , we demonstrate how this formalism can be used for transiting extrasolar planets to efficiently schedule the phase of rv observations in order to minimize uncertainties in the lagrangian orbital elements .",
    "the results are summarized in the last section .",
    "the solution for the time evolution of kepler s problem can be derived in the standard way as given in various textbooks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the restricted two body problem itself is an integrable ordinary differential equation . in the planar case ,",
    "three independent integrals of motion exist and one variable has uniform monotonicity .",
    "the integrals are related to the well known orbital elements , which are used to characterize the orbit .",
    "these are the semimajor axis @xmath5 , the eccentricity @xmath1 and the longitude of pericenter ] @xmath2 .",
    "the fourth quantity is the mean anomaly @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , the mean motion , which is zero at pericenter passage , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the masses of the two orbiting bodies and @xmath10 is the newtonian gravitational constant .",
    "the orbital period is denoted by @xmath11 . ] and @xmath12 is the elapsed time since the pericenter passage .",
    "the solution to kepler s problem can be given in terms of the mean anomaly @xmath13 as defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the eccentric anomaly .",
    "the planar coordinates are @xmath16 where @xmath17 see also @xcite , sect .",
    "2.4 for the derivation of these equations . since for circular orbits the longitude of pericenter and pericenter passage can not be defined , and for nearly circular orbits , these can only be badly constrained ; in these cases it is useful to define a new variable , the mean longitude as @xmath18 to use instead of @xmath13 . since @xmath2 is an integral of the motion , @xmath19 .",
    "therefore for circular orbits @xmath20 and should be replaced by @xmath21 to obtain an analytical solution to the problem , i.e. which is infinitely differentiable with respect to all of the orbital elements and the mean longitude , first let us define the lagrangian orbital elements @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "the derivation of the above equation is straightforward , one should only keep in mind that @xmath26 . in the first part of this section we prove that the quantities @xmath27 and @xmath28 are analytic  infinitely differentiable  functions of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for all real values of @xmath29 and for all @xmath32 . in the following parts , we utilize the partial derivatives of these analytic functions to obtain the orbital velocities and we derive other relations . in this section",
    "we only deal with planar orbits , the three dimensional case is discussed in the next section .",
    "a real function is analytic when all of its partial derivatives exist , the partial derivatives are continuous functions and only depend on other analytic functions .",
    "it is proven in that the partial derivatives of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the following for @xmath35 : @xmath36 and @xmath37 since for all @xmath38 , @xmath39 and therefore @xmath40 , all of the above functions are continuous on their domains .",
    "since the @xmath41 and @xmath42 functions are analytic , therefore one can conclude that the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 are also analytic .    substituting the definition of @xmath34 into",
    ", one can write @xmath45 , \\label{kepler2dspatial2}\\ ] ] while the radial distance of the orbiting particle from the center is @xmath46 . for small eccentricities in third term @xmath47",
    "is negligible compared to the first term @xmath48 while the second term @xmath49 is negligible compared to the third term .",
    "therefore for @xmath50 , @xmath51 is proportional to the difference between the true anomaly and the mean longitude and @xmath52 is proportional to the distance offset relative to a circular orbit ; both caused by the non - zero orbital eccentricity .    since is a combination of purely analytic functions , the solution of kepler s problem is analytic with respect to the orbital elements @xmath5 , @xmath47 , and to the mean longitude @xmath29 in the domain @xmath53 and @xmath38 .",
    "we note here that this formalism omits the parabolic or hyperbolic solutions .",
    "the formalism based on the stumpff functions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides a continuous set of formulae for the elliptic , parabolic , and hyperbolic orbits but this parametrization is still singular in the @xmath54 limit .      assuming a non - perturbed orbit ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath55 , and @xmath56 and when the mean motion @xmath57 is constant , the orbital velocities can be directly obtained by calculating the partial derivative of with respect to @xmath29 and applying the chain rule since @xmath58\\frac{\\partial\\lambda}{\\partial t } = n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda}\\binom{\\xi}{\\eta}.\\ ] ] substituting the partial derivative into the expansion of @xmath59 and @xmath60 one gets @xmath61 . \\label{kepler2dvelocity}\\ ] ] note that is also a combination of purely analytic functions , the components of the orbital velocity are analytic with respect to the orbital elements @xmath5 , @xmath47 , and to the mean longitude @xmath29 .",
    "it is also evident that the time derivative of is @xmath62 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , can be written as @xmath63 which is equivalent to the equations of motion since @xmath64 and @xmath46 .      in this subsection",
    "we summarize some other properties of the functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 which can also be helpful in some derivations or during numerical evaluation .",
    "one of the most important properties is the rotational invariance .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the relation @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath52 and @xmath51 would not change if the mean longitude is increased by an arbitrary angle of @xmath68 and simultaneously the vector @xmath47 is rotated with the same angle .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 this property also results that @xmath70    the terms @xmath71 and @xmath72 appear frequently in the expressions for both the coordinates and the velocities .",
    "these are related to the @xmath73 functions and the orbital elements @xmath47 as @xmath74 or similarly @xmath75 the partial derivatives of @xmath76 and @xmath77 with respect to the mean longitude and the lagrangian orbital elements @xmath30 and @xmath31 are @xmath78 and @xmath79",
    "for an eccentric and inclined orbit , the spatial coordinates of an orbiting body can be obtained in the similar manner as it is done in @xcite , sect .",
    "2.8 . without going into the details , here we present the results of the basic calculations .",
    "the spatial coordinates @xmath80 are @xmath81 where @xmath82 ( see also equations  [ ellip0xi ] and  [ ellip0eta ] ) , and @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the rotational matrices with respect to the argument of pericenter , @xmath86 , the inclination , @xmath87 , and the argument of the ascending node , @xmath68 . by substituting the equations for @xmath88 into and using the rotational invariance of @xmath43 and @xmath44 ,",
    "i.e. , one can derive the spatial coordinates of the orbiting body in a similar manner as it was done in the planar case .",
    "the result can be written in a compact form using some other auxiliary quantities .",
    "first , define the lagrangian orbital elements @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and the quantity @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is defined in .",
    "the spatial coordinates are then @xmath94 since @xmath95 is a linear combination of @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the orbital velocities are linear combinations of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , with the same coefficients , i.e. @xmath100 where @xmath101 .      to compute the orbital elements @xmath102 from the spatial coordinates @xmath103 and velocities @xmath104 , first define @xmath105 the lagrangian orbital elements for the inclination and the argument of the ascending node is then @xmath106 for the eccentricity and the longitude of pericenter one gets @xmath107 the semimajor axis satisfies the well known relation @xcite @xmath108 the mean longitude is then @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "it can be shown that in the planar case , i.e. when @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and do reduce to @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath115 is defined as @xmath116 if @xmath117 and @xmath118 otherwise .",
    "the utilization of the presented formalism can cover various aspects of rv curve analysis . due to the conventions and the definitions of the orbital elements used in the astrophysics of stellar binaries , the evaluation of simply yields the actual radial velocity as the @xmath119 component .",
    ", where @xmath120 is the semi - amplitude of the rv curve ] the partial derivatives in equations ( [ dqdl])-([dpdh ] ) and in equations ( [ dcsdl])-([dcsdkh ] ) can easily be used to calculate the parametric derivatives of the rv curves and therefore to support various fitting algorithms ( e.g. levenberg - marquardt , see * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the secular variations in the radial velocities due to the secular changes in the orbital elements can also be estimated in an analytic way .    in the follow - up observations of planets discovered by transits in photometric data",
    "series , the detection of systematic variations in the rv signal is one of the most relevant steps , either to rule out transits of late - type dwarf stars , and/or blends , or to characterize the mass of the planet and the orbital parameters . since transit timing constrains the epoch and orbital period much more precisely than radial velocity alone , these two can be assumed to be fixed in the analysis of the rv data .",
    "however , this constraint also includes an additional feature . using equation ( 1 ) in @xcite , the mean longitude at transits can be calculated as @xmath121 therefore the mean longitude at the orbital phase @xmath122 becomes @xmath123 .",
    "consequently , the partial derivatives of the @xmath119 rv component @xmath124 with respect to the orbital elements @xmath30 and @xmath31 are @xmath125    a radial velocity curve of a star , caused by the perturbation of a single companion can be parametrized by six quantities : the semi - amplitude of rv variations , @xmath120 , the zero point , @xmath126 , the lagrangian orbital elements , @xmath47 , the epoch , @xmath127 ( or equivalently the phase at an arbitrary fixed time instant ) and the period @xmath11 . in the cases of transiting planets ,",
    "the later two are known since the transit photometric observations constrain both with exceeding precision ( relative to the precision attainable purely by the rv data ) .",
    "therefore , one has to fit only four quantities , i.e. @xmath128 .",
    "the vast majority of the known transiting planets orbits their host stars on a tight orbit and these tight orbits are expected to be circular ( however , there are few known exceptions ) .",
    "now , we show how the optimal phases of observations can be determined to confirm the orbital circularity , i.e. result the smallest uncertainty in the orbital elements @xmath30 and @xmath31 . to obtain the uncertainty of a fitted parameter and/or the correlation between the parameters ,",
    "the fisher matrix method can be utilized @xcite .",
    "this method gives the covariance matrix as @xmath129 where @xmath130 here @xmath131 is the model function which depends on its adjusted parameters @xmath132 , and @xmath12 represents the independent variable(s ) ( in the case of time series , there is one independent variable , the time itself ) .",
    "since in our case there are four unknowns , one has to have at least four data points , in order to completely determine the parameters .",
    "nevertheless , can be formally evaluated providing both the uncertainties and correlations . to determine the best four phases ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) which minimizes the uncertainty in the eccentricity",
    ", one has to minimize the volume of the covariance ellipsoid of the @xmath47 parameters ( a.k.a .",

    ".optimal phases of radial velocity measurements in order to obtain the orbital eccentricity as precise as possible .",
    "the eccentricity and the alignment of the orbit are quantified by the lagrangian orbital elements @xmath30 and @xmath31 . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we minimized @xmath142 as the function of the phases @xmath133 , ",
    ", @xmath136 using the markov chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) method ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "multiple chains were initiated from four random phases ( namely , all of them are chosen uniformly from the interval @xmath143 $ ] ) .",
    "we found that all of the chains converge to a single set of phases that represent the minimum of the function @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , the set of optimal phases is unique : we found the optimal phases are @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : optphase ] these phases are marked on a hypothetical radial velocity curve .",
    "we note that this volume of the covariance ellipsoid of the @xmath47 parameters is approximately @xmath149 times smaller on the average if the phases were chosen randomly , and @xmath150 times smaller if the phases were chosen to be closer with a factor of @xmath151 to the phases @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( i.e. @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 , @xmath157 , respectively ) .    of course , the same kind of calculation of the phases that yields the smallest combined uncertainty in the @xmath47 parameters can be performed for arbitrary orbital eccentricity . for some certain values of @xmath47 ,",
    "these optimal phases are shown in table  [ table : optphases ] .",
    "thus , if some initial values for the orbital elements @xmath30 and @xmath31 are known , further observations can be planned accordingly .",
    "similarly , the optimal phases can be derived for arbitrary number of observations ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "however , it turns out that for @xmath159 , the phase volume @xmath142 have more than one local minima . in order to find the global minimum",
    ", we initiated several hundreds or thousands of individual initial conditions and applied both the previously discussed mcmc method and the downhill simplex algorithm @xcite in order to find the global minimum of @xmath142 . for @xmath160 ,",
    "there are two local minima and the global minimum is at the phases @xmath161 . for @xmath162 , one or more of the phases will be degenerated . in other words",
    ", one should take rv measurements at the same phases in order to minimize the uncertainty in the orbital eccentricity .",
    "for instance , the global minimum is at @xmath163 for @xmath164 or @xmath165 for @xmath166 .",
    "it can be shown that for larger @xmath158 which are multiple of @xmath167 , the optimal phases will be at the exactly same location as in the case of @xmath168 ( see earlier or table  [ table : optphases ] ) , and at each phase one should acquire the same number of measurements , namely @xmath169 .    due to the limitations in the telescope time and in the observation conditions ( including day / night variations or the visibility of the target object )",
    ", rv observations can not be scheduled at the optimal phases . in practice",
    ", we have a series of rv data points and then the upcoming measurements are intended to be acquired to yield the smallest uncertainty in the orbital eccentricity ( or any other parameters that are the points of interest ) .",
    "since this set of phases yields enormous amount of free parameters on which the phases of the upcoming measurements are depend , these phases have to derived independently by hand for each case .",
    "the ` optsn ` code is intended to derive these optimal phases .",
    "] for arbitrary set of fixed observations .",
    "since in a multiple planetary system , secular perturbations result the highest variations in the orbital elements @xmath47 , the proper selection of rv measurement instants can significantly increase the detection probability of other companions .",
    "although the newtonian gravitational two - body problem ( a.k.a . ,  kepler s problem ) is integrable , its solution requires transcendent equations",
    ". moreover the parameter of these equations has a finite discontinuity in the limit of circular orbits , and this ill - behaved property leads to numerical disadvantages .",
    "for instance the calculation of the optimal phases , as presented in section  [ sec : applications ] , can not be performed if the orbit was parametrized by @xmath170 instead of @xmath47 since the partial derivative @xmath171 , which is required to be known to obtain the fisher - matrix , does not exist .    in this paper",
    "a new framework has been presented to describe the time evolution of kepler s problem using analytic functions which omits singular parametrization .",
    "this formalism is then used to construct orbital solution for three dimensional orbits in a similar manner . using this analytic solution ,",
    "it is straightforward to derive the radial velocity function , which is one of the most relevant observable quantities in the physics of stellar binaries and extrasolar planets .",
    "the functions @xmath172 and @xmath173 can be handled as an analytic function , just as simply as if they were a trigonometric function in practice .",
    "it is also straightforward to carry out a fisher analysis of rv data to estimate the expected uncertainty of the physical parameters . the implementation of the functions @xmath172 and @xmath173 are simple in any kind of programming languages , a demonstration code is provided in the ` gnuplot ` language .",
