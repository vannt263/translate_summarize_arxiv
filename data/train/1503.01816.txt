    "in this paper we study random surfaces obtained by gluing , uniformly at random , sides of @xmath0 polygons with various ( not necessarily equal ) number of sides .",
    "we call this scheme of generating a surface the _ map model_. ( a model dual to the map model is very important for algebraic geometry @xcite . it can be generalized to hypermaps ; in @xcite it is called @xmath13-_model_. ) in the map model the interiors of polygons represent countries ( _ faces _ ) ; the glued sides represent boundaries between countries ( _ edges _ ) . thus the map model can be considered as a graph embedded into the surface such that the faces correspond to the original polygons .",
    "this model generalizes the random map model of n.  pippenger and k.  schleich @xcite where all the polygons are triangles , a model motivated by studies in quantum gravity .",
    "in particular , for the euler characteristic @xmath9 of the randomly triangulated surface they proved that @xmath14=n/2-\\log n+o(1)$ ] , @xmath15 , and made startlingly sharp conjectures regarding the remainder terms @xmath16 , based on simulations and results for similar models .",
    "the case when the number of sides of all polygons are equal , gluings of @xmath17-gons ( @xmath18 ) , was considered by a.  gamburd in @xcite .",
    "his breakthrough result was that ( for @xmath19 ) , the underlying random permutation of polygons sides was asymptotically uniform on the alternating subgroup @xmath20 , implying , for instance , that @xmath9 was asymptotic , in distribution , to @xmath21 minus @xmath22 , the gaussian variable , with mean and variance equal @xmath23 .",
    "k. fleming and n. pippenger @xcite used gamburd s result to prove sharp asymptotic formulas for the first four moments of the euler characteristic @xmath9 , in particular confirming their earlier conjectures for @xmath24 . another special case of this model",
    "is when there is only one polygon whose sides are glued in pairs .",
    "this case is well studied , popular , and important in combinatorics and the theory of moduli spaces of algebraic curves .",
    "the classical paper of j.  harer and d.  zagier @xcite solved the difficult problem of enumerating the resulting surfaces by genus .",
    "their result was used in @xcite to determine the limiting genus distribution for the surface chosen uniformly at random from all such surfaces .",
    "the sides of the polygons are glued in pairs .",
    "so the total number of sides @xmath1 of all polygons must be even , and the resulting map will have @xmath8 edges .",
    "we also assume that all polygons are directed and that in each glued pair the edges are directed opposite - wise .",
    "thus the resulting surface will be oriented .",
    "the map model can described in terms of permutations .",
    "label @xmath25 s the directed sides ( edges ) of all polygons by numbers from @xmath3:=\\{1,2,\\dots , n\\}$ ] ; @xmath26 will denote the edge labeled @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the number of polygons with @xmath27 sides , @xmath27-gons , and let @xmath29 stand for the set of all possible numbers of sides of our @xmath30 polygons , so that @xmath31 and each map will have @xmath0 faces .",
    "we define the permutation @xmath32 of @xmath3 $ ] as follows : @xmath33 if @xmath34 follows , immediately , @xmath26 in one of the @xmath0 directed polygons .",
    "thus @xmath32 has @xmath0 cycles , each cycle consisting of the edges of the attendant polygon listed according to the polygon orientation .",
    "the set of all such @xmath32 s is the conjugacy class @xmath35 of permutations of @xmath3 $ ] with @xmath28 cycles of length @xmath27 .",
    "a gluing itself is encoded in the permutation @xmath36 which is a product of transpositions of edges that are glued to each other ; those @xmath36 s are all @xmath37 elements of the conjugacy class @xmath38 of permutations of @xmath3 $ ] with cycles of length @xmath39 only .    here",
    "is how a given pair of permutations @xmath32 , @xmath36 induces the corresponding surface . the first edge @xmath40 is glued to the edge @xmath41 ; the edge @xmath41 is followed by the edge @xmath42 in the directed polygon that contains @xmath41 .",
    "next @xmath43 is glued to @xmath44 followed by @xmath45 in the cycle that contains @xmath44 , and so on , producing a sequence of edges @xmath46 , whose _ tails _ are lumped together as a single vertex . since @xmath47 is a permutation of @xmath3 $ ] , the sequence @xmath46 eventually loops back on the starting edge @xmath40 , forming a cycle @xmath48 of @xmath47 , see the picture : @xmath49[80pt]{\\begin{picture}(100,15)(0,0 )    \\put(0,0){{\\includegraphics}[width=100pt]{cycles.pdf } } \\put(40,17){\\rotatebox{80}{$\\scriptstyle e_1 $ } }      \\put(50,25){\\rotatebox{-67}{$\\scriptstyle \\beta(e_1)$ } }      \\put(65,49){\\rotatebox{-15}{$\\scriptstyle \\alpha(\\beta(e_1))=:e_2 $ } }      \\put(78,58){\\rotatebox{10}{$\\scriptstyle \\beta(e_2)$ } }      \\put(48,72){\\rotatebox{65}{$\\scriptstyle \\alpha(\\beta(e_2))=:e_3 $ } }            \\end{picture}}}\\qquad { { \\raisebox}{-70pt}[0pt][0pt]{\\begin{picture}(140,15)(0,0 )    \\put(0,0){{\\includegraphics}[width=140pt]{cycles2.pdf } } \\put(82,20){$\\scriptstyle e_1$}\\put(115,32){$\\scriptstyle e_2 $ }           \\put(110,64){$\\scriptstyle e_3 $ }       \\end{picture}}}\\ ] ] likewise , starting from the first edge not in this cycle , i. e. distinct from @xmath50 , we obtain an _ independent _ cycle containing this edge , that determines another vertex of the map . proceeding in this fashion",
    ", we eventually partition the edge set into disjoint subsets , each associated with its own vertex of the map .",
    "clearly , the number of those subsets , i. e. the number of vertices @xmath51 , equals the number of cycles of @xmath52 .",
    "also it is obvious that the connected components of the resulting surface correspond to the orbits of the subgroup generated by permutations @xmath32 and @xmath36 . for each such orbit we know the number of faces ( which is equal to the number of cycles of @xmath32 restricted to the orbit ) , the number of edges ( which is equal to the number of cycles of @xmath36 restricted to the orbit ) , and the number of vertices ( which is equal to the number of cycles of @xmath2 restricted to the orbit ) .",
    "thus we know the euler characteristic of the corresponding connected component . since the euler characteristic is a complete topological invariant of connected oriented surfaces , the permutations @xmath32 and @xmath36 completely deteremine the topology of the surface .    for example ,",
