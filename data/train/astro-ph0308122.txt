    "studies of recurrence times and energetics of type i x - ray bursts in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) led to one of the most compelling arguments for their origin as unstable thermonuclear burning of accreted hydrogen and helium ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "long duration broadband x - ray observations with satellites in high orbits such as _ exosat _ allowed high - precision measurements of source fluxes and uninterrupted trains of x - ray bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", @xmath16 is the burst flux , and @xmath17 is the interval from the beginning of one burst to the next , was found to be @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "this is consistent with the energy release in bursts coming from nuclear burning , which gives @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) per nucleon when burning pure helium ( solar abundance material ) to heavy elements , compared to @xmath22 per nucleon from gravitational energy release due to accretion . the general agreement of measured @xmath7 values with this picture was an important confirmation of the thermonuclear burst model .",
    "detailed comparisons of observations and theory have had mixed success , however , particularly attempts to reconcile the observed trends in burst behavior with accretion rate with those expected from theory @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , observational studies are now more difficult because most of the active broadband x - ray observatories are in low earth orbits .",
    "interruptions in the observations due to occultations and passages through localised high - background regions occur at the satellite orbital period , which is of the same order as the typical recurrence time for bursts .    despite such obstacles ,",
    "gs  1826@xmath024 ( also known as ginga 1826@xmath0238 ; @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) is an ideal subject for studying x - ray bursts due to its bright , regular and frequent bursts .",
    "the source was discovered as a new transient by _ ginga _ @xcite .",
    "conclusive evidence of the presence of a neutron star was obtained with the _ bepposax _ detection of thermonuclear bursts @xcite , although this source may also have been the origin of x - ray bursts observed much earlier by _ oso-8 _",
    "@xcite . optical photometry of the @xmath25 counterpart revealed a 2.1  hr modulation , as well as optical bursts @xcite .",
    "the delay time measured between the x - ray and optical bursts is consistent with the binary separation for a 2.1  hr orbit ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "based on optical measurements , the distance , @xmath26 , to the source is at least 4  kpc @xcite .",
    "an upper limit of 8  kpc has been derived from the peak fluxes of bursts measured by _",
    "bepposax _ , _ asca _ and _ rxte",
    "_ @xcite , which would position the source just outside the galactic bulge .",
    "the global accretion rate inferred from the observed flux is then @xmath27 , about a factor of ten higher than the expected time - averaged accretion rate for a ns orbiting a main sequence star in a 2.1  hr orbit @xcite .",
    "such a discrepancy is not surprising for a transient accretor .",
    "extensive _ bepposax _  wide field camera ( wfc ) observations between 1996 august and 1998 october revealed around 70 bursts , which recurred on an average interval of @xmath28  hr ( leading to the pseudonym  the clocked burster  ; * ? ? ?",
    "analysis of the entire wfc sample of 260 bursts revealed that the source consistently exhibits approximately periodic bursts with a recurrence time which decreases significantly as the persistent flux increases @xcite .",
    "such regularity of bursts over a long time span is not observed in other sources and implies a remarkably stable accretion rate , as well as complete burning of the accreted fuel and a constant fuel covering fraction .",
    "based on the decay time scale of the bursts observed by _",
    "rxte _ @xcite and the recurrence times , @xcite suggested that the bursts must involve mixed hydrogen / helium ( h / he ) burning . in this scenario ,",
    "the initial helium flash generates seed nuclei for hydrogen burning , which gives rise to an additional energy release and also allows an active rapid proton ( rp ) process of @xcite .",
    "this process burns hydrogen by successive proton capture reactions on seed nuclei that subsequently @xmath29-decay .",
    "these reactions move the seed nuclei up the proton - rich side of the periodic table ( much like the r - process which occurs by neutron captures on the neutron - rich side of the periodic table ) .",
    "theoretical work indicates that the end point of the rp - process is set either by the complete consumption of the available hydrogen @xcite or by reaching the closed snsbte cycle found by @xcite .",
    "uncertainties still remain in the actual total time to burn the matter , since the @xmath29-decay lifetimes of many of these proton - rich nuclei are not known experimentally .",
    "thus , gs  1826@xmath024  is an ideal candidate to test , and provide input for , our current theoretical understanding of the role of the rp - process in thermonuclear x - ray bursts .",
    "we present new measurements of the burst recurrence time in gs  1826@xmath024 with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "we first compare the properties of different bursts to highlight their unusually uniform properties .",
    "we examine the long - term trend of burst recurrence time as a function of persistent flux , and test for variations in the @xmath7-value within different epochs . by comparing to theoretical models of type i bursts ,",
    "we are able to constrain the metallicity of the accreting material , and the fraction of the neutron star s surface over which accretion takes place .",

    "data from each ssc from each dwell are averaged to obtain the daily intensities of all known sources in the field of view .",
    "the pca is made up of 5 identical co - aligned proportional counter units ( pcus ) sensitive to photons in the energy range 260  kev , and with a total area of @xmath30 .",
    "data is collected during pointed observations in standard data modes ( 1 and 2 ) , as well as a variety of user defined modes offering time resolution up to @xmath31 and 256 energy channels .",
    "the hexte comprises two clusters with @xmath32 total area , each of which contains 4 scintillation detectors collimated to view a common direction and sensitive to photons in the range 15250  kev .",
    "we searched for x - ray bursts in 1-s binned `` standard-1 '' mode data from 43 public _ rxte_/pca observations of gs  1826@xmath024 between 1997",
    "november 5 and 2000",
    "september 27 , totalling 347  ks .",
    "we also searched in a 30  ks proprietary observation from 2002 july 27 ( observation",
    "i d 70044 , pi : rothschild ) .",
    "we identified 24 bursts in total . in three cases the pcus were switched on during what appeared to be the decay from a burst .",
    "we estimated the start time of these burst candidates by comparing the decay light curve with the profile from the burst immediately before or after .",
    "while no blackbody temperature decrease was observed in any of these three cases , no decrease was observed for the other bursts when at the same stage . since the observed profiles of the other bursts are so uniform , we expect the inferred start times to be correct to within 510  s. in a fourth case the burst began while the satellite was still slewing to the source",
    ". for that burst the measurement of the peak flux and fluence are suspect , but the start time was precisely measured . for the analysis presented here , we include these four bursts for calculations of recurrence times but exclude them from any analysis involving measurements of the flux or fluence .    for each burst where we observed the entire profile we extracted pca spectra binned initially at 0.25  s ( with progressively larger bins towards the tail of the burst ) from event mode data ( 125  @xmath33 time resolution and 64 energy channels ) .",
    "we calculated a separate response matrix for each burst using pcarsp version 8.0 ( supplied with lheasoft version 5.2 , 2002 june 25 ) .",
    "we fitted an absorbed blackbody model to each spectrum , using a persistent spectrum extracted from a 16-s interval before the burst as background .",
    "this approach is relatively    = 8.5 cm    standard for x - ray burst analysis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we estimated the bolometric burst flux at each timestep as @xmath34 , from the blackbody ( color ) temperature @xmath35 and normalization @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the apparent photosphere radius in km , and @xmath38 the distance to the source in units of 10  kpc .",
    "we define the burst start as the time at which the bolometric flux exceeds 25% of the peak flux , and the rise time as the interval for the flux to subsequently exceed 90% of the maximum .",
    "we fitted the flux decay to an exponential profile with a `` break '' at which point the @xmath39-folding time is allowed to vary discontinuously .",
    "we integrated the measured fluxes over @xmath40  s covering the burst , and extrapolated beyond this based on the exponential fits , to derive the fluence .",
    "we also estimated the instrumental background using pcabackest version 3.0 and the `` combined '' bright source models , and measured the ( absorbed ) persistent 2.525  kev pca flux by integrating over an absorbed blackbody plus power law model fitted to the persistent ( pre - burst ) spectra .",
    "the mean reduced-@xmath41 for the persistent spectral fits was 1.07 ( 56 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the neutral column density was in most cases poorly constrained and not significantly different from zero , and in the mean was @xmath42 . while this model provided a good fit to the pca data alone , combined fits including the hexte spectrum additionally required modelling of the high - energy spectral cutoff ( see section  [ secalpha ] ) .",
    "the x - ray bursts observed by _",
    "rxte _ were remarkably similar to each other ( fig . [ profiles ] ) .",
    "the rise times were relatively long , betseen 4.75 and 7  s ( @xmath43  s on average ) .",
    "the first exponential decay timescale increased from @xmath44 to @xmath45  s between the 199798 and 2000 bursts , and to @xmath46 for the 2002 bursts .",
    "the variation of the burst profile with epoch is obvious in the averaged lightcurves ( fig .",
    "[ profiles2 ] ) .",
    "the second exponential timescale was , on average , @xmath47  s. the peak fluxes also showed weak evidence for a decrease with time ; the mean for the 7 bursts observed in 199798 was @xmath48 , while for the bursts observed in 20002 it was @xmath49 ( note that the averages of burst properties calculated here exclude the bursts which we did not observe in their entirety ) .",
    "this decrease was substantially larger than the variation in the pre - burst persistent emission ( see  [ inthist ] , below ) .",
    "thus , it appears unlikely that the observed variation in the peak burst flux arose as a side - effect of subtracting the persistent emission as background .",
    "the net effect of the variations in peak flux and timescale was to keep the fluence approximately constant , at @xmath50 .",
    "none of the bursts exhibited evidence for radius expansion , so that the maximum burst flux is a lower limit to the eddington luminosity .",
    "the implied distance limit is consistent with that derived from previous observations .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm      due to its low earth orbit , _ rxte _ can typically only observe any given source for 65% of each 90  min orbit .",
    "thus , it is likely that some bursts were missed during the gaps between observations .",
    "the shortest burst intervals were found between pairs of bursts observed on 1997 november 56 , 2000 jun 30 , and 2002 july 29 , at @xmath51 , 4.00  hr , and 3.58  hr , respectively . while the first value is consistent with other measurements around the same time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the latter two are almost a third shorter .",
    "the other burst intervals measured from the _ rxte _ observations are at least a factor of 2 greater than the shortest intervals , and were close to integer multiples of the two shortest intervals in each epoch .",
    "furthermore , in each of the longer burst intervals , the predicted intermediate burst times ( assuming regular burst occurrence ) fell within data gaps .",
    "thus , it was still possible for the bursts to be recurring on a regular timescale .    in order to independently test for the presence of these intermediate bursts , we examined asm dwells during these longer intervals .",
    "very few dwells occurred close to the predicted time of the bursts .",
    "thus , we found no evidence for bursts at the predicted intermediate times ; on the other hand , with the present data we can not exclude the presence of bursts within these gaps . taking into account these missed bursts , we conclude that the observed burst times are consistent with regular recurrence intervals of @xmath1  hr in 199798 , @xmath2  hr in 2000 , and @xmath3  hr in 2002 .    when combined with _",
    "bepposax _ and _ asca _ observations between 199698 , as well as more recent observations with _ rxte _",
    ", these measurements provide evidence for a long - term , steady decrease in @xmath17 with time ( fig .",
    "[ deltat ] ) . over the same interval",
    ", the 10-d averaged 2 - 10  kev asm intensity measurements of gs  1826@xmath024  show evidence for a long - term trend of increasing persistent flux .",
    "this trend was confirmed by the pca measurements .",
    "the 2.525  kev persistent flux measured during 199798 was @xmath52 , while in 2000 it was @xmath53 .",
    "this variation is significant at the @xmath54 level .",
    "the most recent observation , on 2002 july 29 , found the persistent 2.525  kev flux to be higher again , at @xmath55 .      the burst interval measured from the _ rxte _ observations decreased by 40% between 199798 and 2002 , while over the same period the mean persistent flux increased by 66% . in order to estimate the bolometric correction to apply to the 2.525  kev flux , and",
    "thus estimate the ratio @xmath7 between the integrated persistent flux to the burst fluence ( equation [ ratio ] ) , we extracted pca and hexte spectra covering the entire observation from five representative pointings ( 1997 november , 1998 june , 2000 july , 2000 september and 2002 july ) .",
    "we fitted each spectra to a model consisting of a comptonisation component ( `` comptt '' in xspec ) and a gaussian , both attenuated by neutral absorption along the line of sight . the comptt component features a cutoff at around 2.8 times the temperature of the scattering plasma , which we measured as @xmath56  kev in the mean . in each case",
    "we obtained a good fit ( mean @xmath57 ) over the energy range 2.560  kev .",
    "the mean neutral column density was @xmath58 , which is consistent with the mean value derived from the pca - only pre - burst persistent emission fits .",
    "we then measured the ( absorbed ) flux in the 2.525  kev band , and compared this to the flux in the 0.1200  kev band estimated using an idealized response in order to extrapolate outside the pca / hexte bands .",
    "we found the bolometric correction to be @xmath59 , where the error represents the standard deviation from the results for the 5 observations .    the resulting variation of the burst recurrence interval , as a function of the bolometric persistent flux , is shown in fig .",
    "[ vstheory ] ; qualitatively similar results were found by @xcite from _ bepposax _ wfc observations .",

    "[ ratioplt ] ) .",
    "we found that @xmath7 varied significantly with epoch , decreasing from @xmath66 to @xmath67 between 199798 and 2002 , as the persistent flux increased .",
    "the weighted mean was @xmath9 .    from the _",
    "bepposax_/wfc observations , @xcite derived a value of @xmath68 .",
    "roughly consistent values were determined from _",
    "bepposax_/nfi , _ rxte _ , and _ asca _ observations , of between 5054 @xcite . to understand the discrepancy between these measurements and the value of @xmath7 calculated in the present study , we note firstly that the previous measurements of the burst fluence from _ asca _ and _ rxte _ by @xcite agree well with our measurements . furthermore ,",
    "all the persistent flux measurements appear to agree in general once the difference in the energy band is taken into account .",
    "however , the burst fluence measured by both the _ bepposax _ instruments are around 40% lower than for _ asca _  and _ rxte_. the _",
    "rxte_/pca is known to measure fluxes that are systematically @xmath69% higher than some other instruments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , this offset is insufficient to explain the discrepancy in the measured fluence",
    ". furthermore , the estimate of @xmath7 from _ rxte _ should be independent of any systematic flux offset . despite the substantially higher burst fluence from the _ rxte _ and _ asca _ measurements of @xcite , the calculated @xmath7 was still close to that measured by _",
    "bepposax _ @xcite .",
    "this appears to result from the bolometric correction on the 210  kev _",
    "flux , which is not quoted in the @xcite paper but we estimate at 46 . by comparison ,",
    "the bolometric correction implied by the 210  kev and 0.1200  kev _ bepposax_/nfi measurements by @xcite is 3.3",
    ". from our broadband spectral fits in  [ secalpha ] , we estimate a bolometric correction for _ rxte _ flux in the 210  kev band as @xmath70 .",
    "thus , we attribute the higher @xmath7 measured by @xcite to an excessive bolometric correction factor .",
    "in this section , we compare the observed burst properties with theoretical models of type i burst ignition .",
    "we calculate ignition conditions following @xcite , and refer the reader to that paper for details . since the calculation depends only on the local vertical structure of the layer , we give the results in terms of the local accretion rate per unit area @xmath71 , and the mass per unit area or column depth @xmath72 .",
    "we assume    = 8.5 cm    a @xmath73 neutron star with radius @xmath74 , giving a surface gravity @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the gravitational redshift .",
    "this value for the redshift is close to that recently measured for exo 0748 - 676 ( @xmath77 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we calculate the temperature profile of the accumulating layer of hydrogen and helium , and adjust its thickness until a thermal runaway occurs at the base .",
    "the temperature is mostly set by hydrogen burning via the hot cno cycle , and therefore the cno mass fraction @xmath78 , which we refer to as the metallicity .",
    "our models also include compressional heating and a flux from the crust @xmath79 , but the results are not sensitive to these contributions .",
    "a factor of two change in @xmath79 gives a 2% ( 25% ) change in ignition depth and burst energy for @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) , with a much smaller change in the trend of these properties with @xmath71 .",
    "we take @xmath79 to be constant over the timescale of the observations , i.e. @xmath82 , where the time - averaged local accretion rate @xmath83 is set equal to the value for which the burst recurrence time is @xmath84  hr , and @xmath85 mev per nucleon @xcite .    to calculate the burst energy , we assume complete burning of the h / he fuel layer , and that the accreted material covers the whole surface of the star .",
    "the total energy is then @xmath86 , where @xmath72 is the ignition column depth , @xmath87 is the energy per gram from nuclear burning , and the factor @xmath88 accounts for anisotropic burst emission .",
    "we set the latter parameter equal to unity initially , but use it to track where burst anisotropy might play a role .",
    "we write @xmath89 mev per nucleon , where @xmath90 is the mass - weighted mean hydrogen fraction at ignition .",
    "this expression for @xmath87 assumes @xmath91% energy loss due to neutrinos during the rp process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and gives @xmath92 mev per nucleon for approximately solar hydrogen abundance ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "table [ theorytbl ] gives ignition conditions for four different metallicities . in each case",
    ", we adjust @xmath71 until @xmath94 , as observed in 199798 .",
    "lower metallicity models have less hot cno heating during accumulation , giving a larger ignition column and therefore larger @xmath71 to match @xmath95 .",
    "we are free to vary @xmath71 because of the uncertainty in the @xmath96@xmath71 relation .",
    "the ratio of observed flux and inferred @xmath71 constrains a combination of the gravitational energy release per nucleon , and the degree of anisotropy in the persistent or burst emission .",
    "the persistent flux is @xmath97 where @xmath98 accounts for anisotropy in the persistent emission , and @xmath99 is the gravitational energy release per gram .",
    "the burst fluence is @xmath100 inserting equations ( [ eq : flux ] ) and ( [ eq : fluence ] ) into @xmath101 gives @xmath102 the last column in table [ theorytbl ] gives @xmath103 for the models .",
    "reconciling these values with equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) requires @xmath104@xmath105 , within the range of expected values ( e.g.  @xcite ) , especially since the `` anisotropy '' factor for the persistent emission includes other effects such as energy radiated outside the x - ray band .",
    "the predicted variations in fluence , recurrence time , and @xmath7 with @xmath6 are compared to the observations in figures [ vstheory ] and [ ratioplt ] .",
    "we adjust each curve to match the observed fluence , recurrence time , and @xmath7 at @xmath106 .",
    "the model with @xmath80 ( approximately equivalent to solar metallicity ) agrees very well with the observed burst energy and variation in @xmath7 with @xmath6 .",
    "the predicted burst energy ( table [ theorytbl ] ) is @xmath107 , corresponding almost exactly to the observed fluence for a distance of 6 kpc .",
    "the @xmath108% variation in @xmath7 arises because hydrogen burning occurs between bursts as the layer accumulates . in a given fluid element ,",
    "the time to burn all the hydrogen via the beta - limited hot cno cycle is @xmath109 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , where @xmath78 is the cno mass fraction , and @xmath110 is the accreted hydrogen fraction .",
    "this means that as the recurrence time decreases from @xmath84 to @xmath111  hr , significantly more hydrogen per unit mass is present when the burst ignites , leading to an increase in @xmath87 , and corresponding decrease in @xmath7 .",
    "although our models do not address the time evolution of the burst , the variation in mean burst lightcurves shown in fig .",
    "[ profiles2 ] is consistent with a change in the fuel composition .",
    "however , the solar metallicity model is less successful at explaining the observed variations in @xmath17 and @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ vstheory ] ) . whereas the observations show a decreasing ignition mass , @xmath112 , and a @xmath113% rms variation in @xmath13 , the models have @xmath17 decreasing less steeply than @xmath114 , and a @xmath108% increase in @xmath115 with @xmath6 .",
    "these variations arise because as recurrence time drops , less hydrogen burning occurs , less helium is present at ignition , and the ignition mass increases .",
    "extra heating of the accumulating layer would give a reduced ignition mass and better agreement with the observed trends of @xmath17 and @xmath13 .",
    "for the @xmath80 model in table [ theorytbl ] , the extra flux required to match the observed change in @xmath17 is @xmath116 mev per nucleon for an increase of 50% in @xmath117 .",
    "this could perhaps be provided by residual heat from the ashes of previous bursts @xcite , although time - dependent simulations are required to test this .",
    "a second possibility is that the fraction of the neutron star surface covered by accreted fuel changes with @xmath6 , as suggested by bildsten ( 2000 ) .",
    "we can infer the covering fraction from measurements of the blackbody normalization in the tail of the bursts .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ radius ] the mean value of @xmath118 between @xmath11950  s after the start of each burst .",
    "we staggered the time window over which each average was calculated , to ensure that the mean blackbody temperature over each time interval was approximately constant .",
    "we found a significant decrease of @xmath119% in the blackbody normalization .",
    "a variation of the covering fraction by this amount , and the resulting increase in local accretion rate @xmath71 , would go some way to bringing the @xmath17 and @xmath13 variations into better agreement .",
    "however , the detailed relationship between the measured @xmath37 and the covering fraction is uncertain .",
    "= 8.5 cm    while the observed variation in @xmath7 argues strongly against low metallicity models ( which have a constant composition at ignition since little hot cno burning occurs during accumulation ) , such models give much better agreement with the observed trends in @xmath17 and @xmath13 .",
    "the constant composition leads to an ignition mass almost independent of @xmath6 , giving a constant burst fluence and @xmath17 variations close to @xmath114 .",
    "low metallicity models overpredict the burst energy , since the reduced cno heating leads to a larger ignition mass .",
    "accounting for this discrepancy by increasing the distance to the source requires @xmath120@xmath121 , above the current upper limit .",
    "however , there are other possible ways to bring the burst energy into agreement .",
    "recent time - dependent simulations of bursts by @xcite show that leftover hydrogen and cno nuclei in the ashes of the previous burst lead to extra heating , reducing the critical mass .",
    "also , the fuel may cover only part of the neutron star surface .",
    "table [ theorytbl ] lists the value of @xmath122 that gives agreement with the observed fluence ( eq .  [ [ eq : fluence ] ] ) , where we now interpret @xmath123 as a measure of the area covered by accreted material rather than the neutron star radius . for the low metallicity models , we find @xmath124@xmath125  km at 6 kpc , or covering fractions ( assuming a neutron star radius of 10  km ) of @xmath126@xmath127% .",
    "finally , we address the sensitivity of our results to the fraction of accreted hydrogen .",
    "recent evolutionary models involving intermediate mass binaries @xcite propose that the secondary has undergone some main sequence hydrogen burning , leading to a relatively hydrogen - poor donor ( @xmath128@xmath129 ) .",
    "as an example , we show results for an accreted hydrogen mass fraction @xmath130 in the lower half of table [ theorytbl ] .",
    "the ignition conditions are not very sensitive to the total amount of hydrogen , since only a small amount of hydrogen burns during accumulation .",
    "however , the burst energy is significantly reduced , since @xmath87 depends strongly on the amount of hydrogen versus helium .",
    "the variation in burst properties with flux is not a useful way to distinguish the amount of hydrogen , and is almost identical with figures [ vstheory ] and [ ratioplt ] for the @xmath131 models .",

    "the decrease in @xmath7 with @xmath6 implies that stable burning of hydrogen occurs between bursts .",
    "this requires solar metallicity ( @xmath133 ) in the accreted layer ( fig .",
    "[ ratioplt ] ) .",
    "solar metallicity models also give good agreement with the observed burst energies , as pointed out by bildsten ( 2000 ) .",
    "however , the small variation in fluence , and @xmath17 variation with @xmath6 is difficult to explain with solar metallicity models , which predict @xmath134% variations in fluence , and @xmath17 decreasing less steeply than @xmath114 .",
    "low metallicity models ( @xmath11 ) naturally explain the small variation in burst fluence , and @xmath135 scaling of @xmath17 , since little cno burning occurs between bursts giving an ignition mass almost independent of @xmath6 .",
    "however , the observed @xmath7 variations with @xmath6 rule out low metallicity models",
    ".    there are several possible ways to reconcile the solar metallicity models with the observations of @xmath17 and @xmath13",
    ". studies of timing and spectra of lmxbs indicate that @xmath136 is not always a good indicator of @xmath6 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , we have assumed @xmath137 here .",
    "extra heating of the accumulating layer would act to reduce the critical mass and bring the observations and theory into agreement .",
    "one possibility is that residual heat from the ashes of previous bursts heats the layer ( taam et al .",
    "1993 ; woosley et al .",
    "2003 ) , time - dependent simulations are needed to test this . if the fraction of the neutron star surface covered by fuel changes with @xmath6 , the changing local accretion rate per unit area could also reconcile the models and observations .",
    "we find that the blackbody radius @xmath37 in the tail of the bursts decreased by @xmath13820% between the observed epochs .",
    "if this indicates a change in covering fraction , it would almost be enough to explain the discrepancy .",
    "however , the covering fraction decrease with @xmath6 is opposite to the increase suggested by bildsten ( 2000 ) to explain trends in burst properties",
    ". furthermore , @xmath37 is at best an uncertain measure of the emitting area .",
    "due to variations in the atmospheric opacity with photon energy , the measured blackbody temperature is generally higher than the effective temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , @xmath139 is expected to give an underestimate of the emitting area , by a factor which depends on the detailed structure and composition of the ns atmosphere .",
    "better @xmath140 measurements could be obtained with high resolution spectra and appropriate model atmospheres .",
    "@xcite have recently calculated time - dependent multi - zone burst models including a large nuclear reaction network .",
    "they show that both the rise and decay times of the burst depend sensitively on nuclear properties in the rp - process path , and in addition find burst rise times of several seconds , in good agreement with the observations .",
    "there is much to learn from a detailed comparison of time - dependent simulations with the burst lightcurves . in particular ,",
    "the variation in decay time with accretion rate may directly reflect the changing abundance of hydrogen at ignition .",
    "many bursters show a transition from regular , frequent bursts with long durations at low @xmath71 , to irregular , infrequent and short bursts at high @xmath71 , a behavior first discovered by _ exosat _ @xcite . by comparing _",
    "bepposax_/wfc observations of nine regular type i bursters , @xcite propose that this behavior is common to all bursters , and that the transition occurs at a universal luminosity @xmath141 . while the physics of the transition to irregular bursting is not understood ( e.g.  see discussion by bildsten 2000 ) , we have shown in this paper that the regular bursting seen in gs  1826@xmath024  is well - understood as being due to helium ignition in a hydrogen - rich environment .",
    "this argues that other bursters such as ks  1731 - 260 are in this burning regime when regular bursting is seen ( and not bursting via unstable hydrogen ignition , as suggested by van paradijs et al .",
    "1988 and cornelisse et al .",
    "_ bepposax _ found a peak burst rate for ks  1731 - 260 ( the burster with the largest range in observed @xmath71 s ) of @xmath142 bursts per day . extrapolating the observed @xmath114 dependence of @xmath17",
    ", we expect gs  1826@xmath024  to reach this burst rate , and perhaps transition to irregular bursting at @xmath143 .",
    "further monitoring of the burst behavior of gs  1826@xmath024  will hopefully probe the physics of the transition to irregular bursting .",
