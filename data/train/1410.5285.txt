    "broad balmer emission lines in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are main features of their optical spectra . as originally suggested by woltjer ( 1959 ) , the large widths of the emission lines are generally thought to arise from virial motions of clouds orbiting around a central supermassive black hole ( rees 1984 ; osterbrock & mathews 1986 ) . it has been established that the broad emission lines arise from clouds in the broad - line region ( blr ) photoionized by a central continuum source produced by an accretion disk around the central black hole ( rees 1984 ; ho 2008 ; netzer 2013 ) . the smooth profiles of agn spectra suggest that the number of clouds is large ( arav et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "reverberation mapping of @xmath1 50 agns has revealed that the size of the blr , as measured for h@xmath0 , correlates well with the continuum luminosity ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) ; the latest study of bentz et al .",
    "( 2013 ) reports @xmath2ltd , where @xmath3 is the distance of the h@xmath0-emitting regions from the center and @xmath4 is the continuum luminosity at 5100  in unit of @xmath5 . defining the ionisation parameter as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the electron density of the clouds ,",
    "@xmath8 is the rate of ionizing photons , and @xmath9 is the speed of light , this empirical @xmath10 relation can be explained by photoionized blr clouds that roughly have constant @xmath11 ( e.g. , wandel et al . 1999 ; bentz et al .",
    "2013 ) . here",
    "@xmath8 ( @xmath12 , the ionising luminosity ) is proportional to @xmath13 for a canonical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "this relation assumes that all clouds in the blr and the observer at infinity see the same sed of the ionizing source .",
    "however , we still poorly understand the geometry and dynamics of the blr .",
    "only a limited sample of agns has been studied with reverberation mapping , and the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath14 relation is poorly unknown .",
    "the blr of agns shows very diverse spectral properties ( e.g. , boroson & green 1992 ; shen & ho 2014 ) .",
    "this leads peterson ( 2006 ) to ask :  where does the energy to power the emission lines come from ?",
    "the blr energy budget problem is still unsolved .",
    "the observed agn continuum is neither luminous enough nor hard enough to account for the broad lines .",
    "does the blr see a different continuum than we do , or is there an energy source we have not yet recongnized ? \"    from a theoretical perspective , agns with very high accretion rates may offer a promising avenue to addressing some of these longstanding problems .",
    "accretion disks become geometrically thick with increasing accretion rates so that self - shadowing effects are important , leading to strongly anisotropic illumination of the blr .",
    "agns with accretion rates in the shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 , hereafter ss ) regime have been extensively studied .",
    "netzer ( 1987 ) discusses the effects of anisotropic emissions from geometrically thin disks on emission lines ; he treats limb darkening and the @xmath15 angular dependence of the radiation intensity , where @xmath16 is the angle of line of sight to the disk axis .",
    "although the radiation from geometrically thin disks shows anisotropy through the @xmath17 term , the observational consequences on the blr are minimal .",
    "by contrast , accretion flows with high accretion rates , known as slim disks ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ) , develop sharp funnels as a consequence of their geometrically thick structure when they have accretion rates higher than a few @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "this is expected to produce much more dramatic anisotropic illumination of the blr .",
    "in the nearby universe , slim disks are believed to power narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1 ; osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) , which contain relatively low - mass black holes with higher accretion rates ( boller et al . 1996 ; wang & netzer 2003 ) .",
    "direct observational evidence for slim disks is still relatively scarce ( but see kawaguchi et al .",
    "2004 ; desroches et al . 2009 ; jin et al .",
    "2009 ) , limited by the availability of reliable sed predictions for this regime of accretion rates .",
    "some effects of the anisotropic radiation on seds have been discussed by czerny & elvis ( 1987 ) for standard disks with higher accretion rates and madau ( 1988 ) for simplified tori .",
    "watarai et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and li et al .",
    "( 2010 ) studied the geometric effects of slim disks on seds of ultraluminous x - ray sources .",
    "however , the effects of anisotropic illumination of a slim disk on the blr of agns have not be explored in the published literature .",
    "this is the subject of our current work .    beginning with a general treatment of the structure of accretion disks from low to high accretion rates",
    ", we show that the self - shadowing effects of the funnel in a slim disk produce a strong angular dependence of the radiation field .",
    "the high degree of anisotropy of the radiation field naturally defines two spatially and kinematically distinct regions in the blr .  2",

    "observational implications beyond the blr are discussed in  4 .",
    "the last section presents a brief summary .",
    "the geometry of accretion disks , which is controlled by the accretion mode , determines the anisotropy of the radiation field .",
    "the accretion mode is governed by the dimensionless accretion rate , defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the accretion rate , the eddington luminosity @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the black hole mass , @xmath24 is the gravitational constant , @xmath25 is the proton mass , and @xmath26 is the thomson cross section .",
    "ss disks in the sub - eddington regime ( @xmath27 ) are characterized by the following features ( see frank et al .",
    "2002 ) : ( 1 ) keplerian angular momentum distribution ; ( 2 ) energy balance between dissipation and radiative cooling is localized so that radial advection of energy can be neglected ; and ( 3 ) the disk maintains a geometrically thin configuration .",
    "the anisotropy of an ss disk simply depends on the factor @xmath28 because the disk is geometrically thin .",
    "it should be noted that most agns studied with reverberation mapping ( bentz et al .",
    "2013 ) are in the ss regime .",
    "the anisotropy of ss disks is much weaker than that of slim disks .",
    "when the accretion rate @xmath29 increases , the above - mentioned features dramatically change .",
    "in such a situation , the angular momentum distribution is sub - keplerian , the radial velocity of the accretion flow becomes comparable with the keplerian rotation , which leads to strong photon trapping and a saturated luminosity , and , in particular , the inner parts of the disk develop a sharp funnel .",
    "the funnel produces strong self - shadowing effects depending on the actual accretion rates .",
    "there has been increasing attention on numerical simulations of slim disks ( ohsuga et al .",
    "2005 ; mckinney et al .",
    "2014 ; sadowski et al . 2014 ; yang et al . 2014",
    "; jiang et al . 2014 ) . the general properties of slim disks from these simulations agree with the solutions derived from the vertically averaged equations of the disk .    for explicit discussion of the effect of slim disks on the blr",
    ", we start from the averaged equations for slim disks . hoshi ( 1977 )",
    "introduced the polytropic relation @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the polytropic index and @xmath32 is a constant , and vertically integrated the equations for an axisymmetric accretion disk . for convenience to the readers , we give the vertically averaged equations of slim disks ( e.g. , muchotrzeb & paczynski 1982 ; matsumoto et al . 1984 ; abramowicz et al .",

    "angular momentum conservation is governed by @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the specific angular momentum at @xmath44 and at the inner edge @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the turbulent viscosity .",
    "the radial motion follows from @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the integrated pressure , @xmath49 is the total pressure , @xmath50 is the keplerian rotation velocity and @xmath51 is the keplerian angular momentum .",
    "we adopt the @xmath52 prescription for the viscosity ( ss ) , such that @xmath53 .",
    "the vertical structure maintains a statistic equilibrium @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the height of the disk .",
    "we use @xmath56 in our calculations .",

    "the diffusion approximation holds well for high accretion rates .",

    "0.5 cm    figure 1 shows the disk structure for different black hole masses and accretion rates . for ss disks ,",
    "we still get transonic structures , which allow us to avoid the density singularity at the inner edge .",

    "( 1988 ) , szuszkiewicz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , chen & wang ( 2004 ) , and watarai et al .",
    "these dynamical behaviors lead to radiation properties that differ from those in a ss disk .    the fast radial transportation of accretion flows leads to inefficient radiation from the disk surface caused by very large optical depth to thomson scattering .",
    "this crucial property has two consequences .",
    "first , as a result of the effective temperature dependence of @xmath77 , the emergent spectrum is characterized by @xmath80 . and second , the radiative efficiency @xmath81 , such that the luminosity saturates as @xmath82.\\ ] ] this approximation derives from a fit to numerical results ( mineshige et al .",
    "2000 ) and is consistent with the self - similar solution for slim disks ( wang & zhou 1999 ) .",
    "the saturated luminosity is only logarithmically dependent on accretion rate and is linearly proportional to black hole mass .",
    "this unique property of slim disks suggests that super - eddington accreting massive black holes ( seambhs ) potentially may serve as standard candles for cosmology , provided that black hole masses can be measured accurately by reverberation mapping ( wang et al .",
    "a recent agn reverberation mapping campaign shows that seambhs are a promising new tool for cosmology of the high-@xmath83 universe ( du et al .",
    "2014 ; wang et al .",
    "2014 ) .    in our simplified model of slim disks ,",
    "the saturated luminosity still depends on @xmath84 . for more accurate application of seambhs as standard candles for precision cosmology , it is still important for us to try to constrain @xmath29 .",
    "although the emergent spectra is highly insensitive to the accretion rate , fortunately , the _ shape _  of the slim disk itself _ is _",
    "sensitive to @xmath29 once accretion rates are sufficiently high .",
    "as we discuss below , self - shadowing effects arising from the geometric shape of the slim disk strongly influence the illumination of the blr .",
    "this gives an opportunity to constrain the accretion rate from observations of the blr emission .",
    "0.5 cm        we obtain solutions for the structure of accretion disks from sub - eddington accretion rates to extremely high , super - eddington rates ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "this allows us to build up the smooth transition from ss to slim disks .",
    "the general features of the disk geometry are characterized by the appearance of sharper funnels with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "the first row of panels in figure 1 shows the relative height of the disk for different values of @xmath23 and @xmath29 .",
    "we find that @xmath86 is very insensitive to the black hole mass .",
    "the shape of a slim disk has three notable features : ( 1 ) a funnel develops in the innermost region [ @xmath87 ; ( 2 ) a flattened part [ @xmath88 and @xmath74 ] ; ( 3 ) and a geometrically thin part ( @xmath90 ) , approaching the ss regime , in which the funnel disappears .",
    "the left panel of figure 2 shows the height of the disk as a function of radius ; the funnel structure is clearly evident .",
    "the height of the funnel increases with accretion rates .",
    "there is a critical point , which can be used to define the funnel radius ( @xmath91 ) , wherein @xmath86 reachs its maximum value [ @xmath92 ; we denote the disk height @xmath93 at @xmath91 .",
    "we define @xmath94 as the half angle of the funnel . from the numerical results in figure 1 , we approximate @xmath95 , where @xmath96 .",
    "we note that the photon - trapping radius can be approximated by @xmath97 ( equation 22 in wang & zhou 1999 ) , which is larger than @xmath91 and much more sensitive to accretion rate .",
    "this guarantees that photon - trapping processes dominate in the funnel region and that the blr size is mainly determined by the saturated luminosity .",
    "we digress for a moment to point out the radiation distribution along with accretion disks .",
    "since the surface flux @xmath98 $ ] , the fraction of the dissipated energy within @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the inner edge of the disk .",
    "for a schwartzschild black hole , @xmath103 , and we have @xmath104 for @xmath105 , namely that most of the gravitational energy is released within a few tens of schwartzschild radii .",
    "although its formation mechanism remains uncertain , the corona is expected to follow the distribution of gravitational energy release ( e.g. , svensson & zdzarski 1994 ; merloni & fabian 2002 ; wang et al .",
    "2004 ; uzdensky 2013 ) .",
    "the corona itself may be less anisotropic than the disk , but it should still be shadowed to the blr clouds by the slim disk . and while the corona generates hard x - rays , the fraction of gravitational energy dissipated in the hot corona decreases with increasing accretion rate , generally limited to less than @xmath106 in nls1s ( wang et al .",
    "2004 ; yang et al . 2007 ; see table 6 in grupe et al .",
    "therefore , hard x - rays play only a minor role in powering h@xmath0 emission , compared to uv and soft x - rays , which come from the innermost regions of the slim disk . as we show below",
    ", strong soft x - ray emission is one of the characteristics of slim disks , and the uv and soft x - rays are highly anisotropic with respect to the blr clouds .",
    "the portion of the ionizing source that reaches the blr is determined by the relative orientation between the clouds and the surface of the disk . for h@xmath0 line emission",
    ", we define the radius of the disk with a temperature of @xmath107 kev ( the main drivers of h@xmath0 emissions ) as @xmath108 .",
    "we find @xmath109 .",
    "if the @xmath110 regions are partially obscured by self - shadowing , the region with ionized hydrogen atoms will shrink .",
    "it is thus useful to define the opening angle of the funnel for the h@xmath0-emitting region by the shape of the disk at radius @xmath108 .",
    "the right panel of figure 2 shows that @xmath111 and @xmath112 are approximately equal to each other .",

    ", the clouds are exposed to seds and luminosities different from the observer .",
    "these two effects may introduce scatter to the @xmath142 relation and may allow an opportunity to relax the energy budget in the blr .",

    "obviously , the manner in which h@xmath0 responds to the varying continuum depends on the properties of the clouds in the four subregions .",

    "this suggested effect is based on the fact that clouds in region ii have a large column density to reverberate with the varying continuum .    comparing the time lags between regions i and ii , we have the following ratios : @xmath217 for @xmath218 and @xmath219 . equation ( 22 ) includes two kinds of reverberations described by equation ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) .",
    "it is very important that the ratios depend on the dimensionless accretion rate @xmath29 .",
    "we note that the radiated luminosity tends to be saturated for seambhs , and the seds will be insensitive to @xmath29 .",

    "fortunately , the ratio of fluxes and time lags of h@xmath0 emission are mildly sensitive to @xmath29 , and so we may be able to constrain @xmath29 from monitoring the two components of h@xmath0 emission .",
    "equation ( 22 ) provides a useful way to estimate @xmath29 , through the numerical approximation    @xmath220    the above discussion assumes that the ionized clouds in region i emit anisotropically , which may or may not strictly hold in all cases .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that on average the clouds in region i will have longer lags than those in region ii .",

    "if the ionization parameter in region ii is much higher than that in region i , h@xmath0 from region ii may not reverberate . in such a case , while both vbc and ibc are present in the composite line profile , only the ibc will respond to variations in the ionizing continuum .",
    "the @xmath10 relation ( kaspi et al . 2000 ; bentz et al .",
    "2013 ) is roughly consistent with the blr having a constant @xmath11 .",
    "the observed tightness of the relation , strongly suggests that the ionizing continuum received by the blr clouds is the same as that seen by the observer .",
    "indeed , most of the @xmath150 reverberation - mapped agns are sub - eddington systems , whose ss disk is not expected to produce strong anisotropic emission .",
    "super - eddington agns , however , being strongly affected by the self - shadowing effects discussed in this work , produce broad - line emission from two distinctive regions , each with a different lag .",
    "the observed lag is the sum of the lags from regions i and ii .",
    "if the h@xmath0 emission is not decomposed into the vbc and ibc , the lag of the total h@xmath0 flux @xmath221 can be determined by the cross correlation function , @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the ratio of fluxes in the two regions , @xmath224 @xmath225 @xmath226 and @xmath227 are the autocorrelation functions with peaks at @xmath228 and @xmath229 , which are the lags of the two components . here",
    "we note that the observed continuum only comes from region i for observers with small @xmath16 .",
    "the observed lag is the averaged values of @xmath228 and @xmath229 , which are governed by the covering factors of regions i and ii and the anisotropy ( @xmath192 ) of h@xmath0 emission from the blr clouds . since the covering factors are related to the fluxes of the two components and @xmath29 ( see eq .",
    "8) , for extremely high accretion rates @xmath230 may dominate @xmath231 , in which case @xmath229 can be significantly shorter than the lag predicted from the @xmath142 relation .",
    "therefore , we predict that super - eddington sources should significantly deviate from the normal @xmath142 relation",
    ".    the ratios of fluxes and lags of the two components depend on the funnel opening angle and accretion rate .",

    "note that the timescale of keplerian rotation is given by @xmath232 yr , where @xmath233 .",
    "this timescale is much longer than typical monitoring periods ( about 6 months ) , and thus the individual regions should retain stable emission profiles during the course of an observational campaign .",

    "needless to say , improved velocity - resolved reverberation mapping should be applied to test whether the ibc shows any evidence for velocity shifts .      apart from the different reverberation response of h@xmath0 from regions i and ii expected in the time domain , the single - epoch spectra of agns powered by slim disks may exhibit kinematic signatures that distinguish them from agns with lower accretion rates .",
    "the h@xmath0 profiles of nls1s are close to lorentzian ( e.g. , zhou et al .",

    "the lorentzian profile may depend on the rotation , inflows , outflows , turbulence , and even the orientation of the blr to the observer ( see kollatschny & zetl 2011 ) .",
    "a lorentzian profile in principle can be decomposed mathematically into two distinct gaussian components , which plausibly may be related to the two regions invoked in our scenario .",
    "the highly anisotropic illumination of slim disks naturally predicts this type of two - component structure of the blr .",
    "reverberation mapping provides a promising method to decouple these two components in the time domain .",
    "velocity - resolved reverberation mapping , which identifies the lags of different parts of the line profile with the varying continuum , has been applied to infer the dynamical structure of the blr ( e.g. , denney et al .",

    "this idea generally works if the velocity field of the blr clouds is not degenerate with respect to their spatial distribution .",
    "however , the velocity field does not uniquely map to the spatial domain because the observer only views the velocity projected along the line of sight .",
    "for example , the core of the h@xmath0 profile may come from different regions of the blr .",
    "this limits the application of velocity - resolved reverberation mapping to reconstruct the blr , in particular for high - accretion rate agns .",

    "the @xmath2355007 emission line is a prominent feature in the spectra of agns and quasars ( e.g. , vanden berk et al . 2001 ) , but it is generally relatively weak in nls1s ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; boller et al .",
    "1996 ) and especially in systems with high accretion rates ( boroson 2002 ; shen & ho 2014 ) .",
    "the inverse correlation between the strength of the narrow lines and eddington ratio holds not only for  but also for other high - ionization narrow lines ( shen & ho 2014 ) .",
    "the fundamental reason why the amount of narrow - line emission is connected with the accretion rate is still unclear .",
    "here we suggest that the suppression of high - ionization narrow - line emission with increasing eddington ratio arises naturally from the strong anisotropy of the ionizing radiation field of slim disks .",
    "the deep funnel of the disk confines the ionization cone to illuminate only a portion of the narrow - line region , thus reducing the strength of the narrow lines , especially those of high ionization .",
    "this explanation agrees with the interpretation of `` eigenvector 1 , '' as suggested by boroson & green ( 1992 ) .",

    "additionally , the profile of nls1s often has blue wings ( e.g. , boroson 2005 ) .",
    "with eddington ratios of @xmath234 ( equation 2 ) , we would like to point out that slim disks may generate radiation pressure - driven outflows on large scales ( e.g. , king et al .",
    "2011 ; pounds & king 2013 ) .",
    "large - scale outflows driven by slim disks may also explain the correlation between extended radio emission and blue - asymmetric lines seen in obscured luminous quasars ( e.g. , stocke et al .",

    "some quasars with nearly featureless spectra have been found in sdss ( e.g. , plotkin et al . 2010 ) ; their physical nature is not understood .",
    "x - ray observations of radio - quiet weak - line quasars show that they have steeper spectra in the 2 - 10 kev band and an order of magnitude fainter x - ray emission than normal quasars ( wu et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "empirically it has been established that the steepness of the x - ray slope correlates with eddington ratio ( e.g. , lu & yu 1999 ; wang et al .",
    "this can be understood phenomenologically by appealing to more efficient compton cooling of the hot corona by seed photons from the cold part of the disk in systems with high accretion rates .",
    "this not only steepens the x - ray spectrum but also reduces the output of hard x - rays .",
    "slim disks may naturally suppress thermal instabilities and prevent the formation of a two - phase medium , thus suppressing strong line emission .",
    "furthermore , self - shadowing obscures the x - rays from the hot corona of the disk surface and enhances the suppression of the instabilities .",
    "these two factors reduce the strength of the line emission and may explain the appearance of weak - line quasars . as a specific example , the narrow - line quasar phl 1811 ,",
    "which has x - ray spectral properties very similar to those of nls1s , has a very soft sed and shows relatively weak emission lines in the optical and uv bands ( leighly et al .",
    "we attribute the weak line emission in phl 1811 to the self - shadowing effects of its slim disk .",
    "alternatively , laor & davis ( 2011 ) suggest that the suppressed line emission of weak - line quasars can be explained by the low temperature of the accretion disks around very massive black holes .",
    "this hypothesis can be tested with detailed multiwavelength characterization of the seds and accurate black hole mass measurements .      the well - known relation between reverberation in the near - infrared ( @xmath255 ) with the varying optical - uv continuum in agns ( suganuma et al .",
    "2006 ) is consistent with the sublimation radius of dust particles evaporated by a central uv source , @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the uv luminosity of the central energy source and @xmath258 k is the evaporation temperature of dust particles ( barvainis 1987 ) .",
    "this reverberation relation results from the reprocessed emission of the uv radiation from the central disk .",
    "it is interesting to note that it also sets up strong constraints on the blr ( netzer & laor 1993 ) .",
    "however , the self - shadowing effects of slim disks , if the opening angle of the funnel is smaller than the opening angle of the torus , reduces the heating of the inner edge of the torus , leading to a general shrinking of its inner radius . this potential effect has been noted by kawaguchi ( 2013 ) but has yet to be observed .",
    "it would be interesting to systematically study the near - infrared reverberation to the optical and uv emission in agns with high accretion rates .",
    "if the above picture holds , the time lags in the near - infrared will be much shorter than those predicted by the @xmath259 relation of suganuma et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "hot dust particles are a generic constituent of the dusty torus invoked in agn unification schemes ( antonucci 1993 ) , and they should emit strong infrared emission ( pier & krolik 1993 ) . this basic expectation is borne out in many infrared observations of agns ( e.g. , neugebauer et al . 1987 ; haas et al .",
    "2003 ; hatziminaoglou et al .",
    "2008 ) . however , there is growing evidence for a minority of quasars that appear to be dust - poor ( hao et al . 2011 ) or even dust - free ( jiang et al .",
    "are these systems really deficient in dust ?",
    "the self - shadowing effects from slim disks may provide a simple and natural explanation for this class of objects .",
    "again , if the funnel opening angle is smaller than that of the dusty torus , the torus will not be effectively irradiated by the disk .",
    "further , if the torus is supported by the radiation of the accretion disk ( pier & krolik 1992 ) , it may collapse in the presence of self - shadowing effects from a slim disk , further reducing the ability for the torus to be illuminated by the disk .",
    "the torus will thus be infrared - faint and appear to be dust - poor , or even dust - free .",
    "a key observational test of our alternative scenario for the origin of infrared - weak quasars is to quantify the metallicity of the blr using the uv line diagnostics suggested by hamann & ferland ( 1999 ) .",
    "if a quasar is genuinely dust - poor , we expect it also to be metal - poor , to the extent that metal and dust content scale with each other in galaxies ( e.g. , draine et al .",
    "2007 ) . in our scenario ,",
    "infrared - weak quasars are only apparently dust - poor because the uv photons do not intercept the torus due to the geometric configuration of slim disks .",
    "they should , in fact , have normal dust content , and hence normal metal content .",
    "based on the vertically averaged equations of an accretion flow in the super - eddington regime , we show that the structure of slim disks contains a sharp inner funnel and a flattened outer region that produces strong self - shadowing and anisotropy of the radiation field .",
    "we calculate the seds received by clouds located at different orientations in the blr and show that the anisotropy of the radiation field increases with accretion rate .",
    "this allows us to naturally link the structure of the central engine and the blr in agns .",
    "we demonstrate that self - shadowing leads to anisotropic illumination of the blr clouds , which leads to diverse observational properties of broad emission lines such as h@xmath0 and .",
    "the strong anisotropy of the radiation field naturally divides the blr into two regions , which have kinematically distinct line widths and temporal response to continuum variations .",
    "these predictions can be tested with reverberation mapping of agns with high accretion rates ( e.g. , nls1s ) .",
    "we also extensively discuss other observational consequences of the self - shadowing effects of slim disks in agns .",
    "these include : departures from the relationship between blr size and luminosity ; longer time lags for reverberation of ; the lorentzian profile of broad h@xmath0 in nls1s ; suppression of high - ionization narrow emission lines in systems with high eddington ratios ; origin of weak - line quasars ; and reduction of infrared emission from the dusty torus , which can explain apparently dust - poor or dust - free objects .",
