    "the morphological classification scheme for extended extragalactic radio sources described by fanaroff and riley ( 1974 ) divides these objects into two groups : radio structures decreasing in brightness as the distance from the core increases are classed as fri and sources with bright hotspots at the extremities are labelled frii .",
    "the two types of object have hitherto been observed to be fairly sharply divided by a luminosity value known as the fri / frii break , with friis being the more luminous .",
    "jets from active galactic nuclei generally give rise to structures which fall into both of these categories although the literature contains assertions that optically powerful quasars with fri type radio structures do not exist ( falcke et al .",
    ", 1995 ; baum et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "the general view was that quasars either had luminous frii structures with hotspots or one sided core - jet structure ( radio - loud quasars ) , or they did not have any significant radio emission other than unresolved cores ( radio - quiet quasars ) . however , these claims were based purely on the absence of fri quasars from the bright 3c survey together with their absence from limited snapshot ( i.e.  few minute ) radio images in the case of optically selected quasars .",
    "the inadequecy and insufficiency of short snapshot images only sensitive to small spatial scales were critiqued by blundell ( 2005 ) .    in general , radio observations of quasars to date",
    "have consisted of a short ` snapshot ' observation using the vla in the extended a- or b - array configurations ( e.g.  miller et al . , 1990 ; miller et al , 1993 ; kellermann et al . , 1994 ; hooper et al",
    ", 1996 ; kukula et al . , 1998 ;",
    "goldschmidt et al . , 1999 ;",
    "white et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "observations of this type would be inadequate for detecting fri structures for two reasons .",
    "first , as the name would imply the integration time of a snapshot observation is generally short ( @xmath0 minutes ) which compromises the sensitivity and ability to perform high - fidelity deconvolution .",
    "second , the extended configurations of the vla will resolve out the extended structures with low intensity gradients , features which are characteristic of fri sources .",
    "thus it is at least plausible that observations to date have not detected smooth , faint 100-kpc - scale fri structures with quasars simply because the observations have been inadequate .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the luminosity of every previously identified fri source is below or very close to the fri / frii break luminosity , which at 178  mhz is @xmath110@xmath2  w  hz@xmath3  sr@xmath3 ( fanaroff & riley , 1974 ) .",
    "this explains the lack of fri structures associated with quasars found so far as the fri / frii break luminosity falls below the flux limit at the rather low redshift of 0.4 , for some of the current deepest low - frequency selected complete samples ( rawlings et al , 1998 ; blundell , rawlings & willott , 1999 ) .",
    "this leads on to the final consideration for the apparent lack of fri quasars .",
    "the rarity of quasars implies that large volumes of space must be searched in order to observe one or more fr i sources",
    ". generally quasars are found at redshifts greater than 0.4 , and as more distant quasars are observed the feasibility of detecting a low - luminosity fr i source decreases for a radio flux - limited survey .    given that jets of both fri and frii morphologies are common for many types of active galaxy , coupled with the above observational considerations , it is plausible that the lack of fri - type quasars is not due to the fact that they do not exist but because the existing observations and radio surveys are simply not detecting them .",
    "in fact the first _ deep _ image of the so - called radio quiet , optically powerful quasar e1821 + 643 serendipitously revealed a 300  kpc fri jet structure ( blundell & rawlings , 2001 ) .    with this discovery and the limitations of previous observations firmly in mind vla observations of 18 quasars selected from the 7c quasar survey ( riley et al . , 1999 )",
    "were scheduled .",
    "the objects selected were fri candidates from the 7c quasar survey and details of the selection criteria and the observations can be found in section[sec : observations ] . in section[sec : results ] we present combined multi - vla - configuration radio images and flux density measurements of the 18-object sample .",
    "section[sec : discussion ] contains morphological discussions on a per - source basis , as well as redshift - dependent considerations both for our sample and for fr i quasars in general . concluding remarks are presented in section[sec : conclusions ] .    throughout this paper the @xmath4  =  70  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 ,",
    "@xmath5  =  0.3 and @xmath6  =  0.7 cosmology is used .",
    "the starting point for the sample selection was the 7c quasar survey ( riley et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "this ` filtered sample ' of quasars was chosen from a complete sample selected to be brighter than 100mjy at the low radio frequency of 151mhz , and optical colour filters were applied to favour the detection of quasars .    beginning with the riley et al .",
    "sample , we took the bona fide quasars ( confirmed via unpublished optical spectra ; rawlings , priv .",
    "comm . ) and plotted their radio flux density measurements from the first survey ( becker et al . , 1995 ) against those of the nvss survey ( condon et al . , 1998",
    ") , as can be seen in figure [ fig : nvss_first ] .",
    "the first and nvss surveys were carried out with the vla in its b- and d - array configurations respectively .",
    "higher flux density values in d - array observations when compared to those of b - array at the same frequency are an indicator that there is undetected extended structure .    in figure",
    "[ fig : nvss_first ] we see many objects with clear indications of extended structure . given the finite amount of observing time available , we could neither observe all objects in the sample nor all objects with evidence of extended structure .",
    "the sample we chose to observe is therefore in no sense complete but we believe it to be representative of the 7c quasar survey .",
    "the 18 quasars we observed are listed in table[tab : obstable ] which also lists their spectroscopically measured redshifts .",

    "whether a source is classified as an fri or an frii is determined by the morphology from radio imaging ( fanaroff and riley , 1974 ) .",
    "if the source is edge brightened at the extremities and with compact hotspots then it is generally of the frii ( i.e.  classical double ) type .",
    "the radio maps presented in figures[fig : radiomaps1 ] , [ fig : radiomaps2 ] and [ fig : radiomaps3 ] show a variety of different structures .",
    "generally the objects can be classed as either classical double frii sources or the fri type twin jet sources , however there are also the more ambiguous structures which could be classified as fat doubles ( owen & laing , 1989 ) or hybrid sources ( gopal - krishna & wiita , 2002 ) .",
    "a discussion of each quasar follows , including morphological deductions from the radio images and the behaviour of the measured flux density with @xmath9 coverage .",
    "certain objects have also been previously observed at 8ghz using the vla in b - array .",
    "the features visible in these unpublished maps are discussed where relevant .",
    "the increased resolution provided by the high frequency observations is useful for identifying compact regions of enhanced surface brightness .",
    "features such as these arising at the extremities of the object are thought to coincide with the shock fronts occuring as the jets collide with the ambient medium forming hotspots .",
    "these are generally taken as evidence that the kinetic energy of the jet is still feeding the lobe head .",
    "rounded , edge - brightened lobes which lack compact hotspots are generally a property of a fat double source .",
    "objects are classified as fri twin jet sources when they exhibit large - scale extended radio structure that is similar to what is seen to arise from the twin - jet radio sources in the nearby universe .",
    "* 1009 + 4655 : * this source shows two bright lobes with extended emission .",
    "there is no compact object visible at the central pointing position .",
    "examination of the 8-ghz image reveals that the two peaks present in the 1.4-ghz image are each resolved into elongated jet - like features as seen in some fr is .",
    "these do not appear compact in the high resolution image .",
    "the axial ratio means that this object would most likely be classified as a fat double .",
    "the diffuse low brightness extensions to the south west of the object may be plumes of emission diverted at right angles to the jet axis .    * 1018 + 3542 : * the flux - density behaviour of this object points to high variability and does not suggest any structure is being resolved out at any stage .",
    "this source is by far the brightest object in the sample , at almost 0.7jy , and it is likely that the strength of the core is limiting the dynamic range of the image making detection of extended low surface brightness emission difficult .",
    "the features which are detected hint at the presence of a highly asymmetric structure , as is consistent with several other objects in this sample ( see below ) .",
    "this may be a consequence of relativistic doppler boosting .",
    "* 1021 + 4523 : * the flux density values for this object increase with decreasing array size suggesting undersampling of smooth extended structure by the extended arrays .",
    "this would ususally be an indicator of an fri type object however the southern part of this object appears to contain a compact hot spot with a coherent structure linking it to the core .",
    "this unusual object would probably be classified as a fat double , or hybrid source .",
    "this object exhibits similarities with hybrid sources such as 0131367 ( gopal - krishna & wiita , 2002 ) with jets of fri and frii characteristics on different sides of the nucleus .",

    "1022 + 3931 : * the central pointing coordinates are coincident with the brightest of the four components visible in the map .",
    "the next brightest peak to the north west of the core is most likely a hotspot and this object is probably a frii classical double .",
    "no emission linking the quasar to the peak visible to the east was found , even by varying the size of the restoring beam .",
    "it is likely however that this is emission from a second hotspot .    *",
    "1023 + 3604 : * this source can be classified as a fri twin jet source even though the extended structure is very close to the noise in the map . the extended emission on each side of the core share a parallel axis even though they are slightly offset from the core .",
    "this is characteristic of a single twist in the jets although precession of the jet axis may also be a possibility ( c.f",

    "* 1023 + 4414 : * the spatial resolution of this image was deliberately degraded in order to reveal the extended emission .",
    "higher resolution imaging showed only the core and the peak to the west , resolving out the diffuse envelope surrounding them .",
    "the fifth positive contour hints at meandering emission with a comparatively large transverse angular size .",

    "the diffuse feature to the east of the object is probably associated with the quasar . in a similar way to the maximum resolution image of 1029 + 3224 the emission to the east appears as a secondary low brightness peak connected to the core in both the b - array data associated with this sample and the vla first survey image .",
    "this object is most likely to be a twin jet fri source , a claim backed up by comparison of the flux density measurements ( see table [ tab : fluxtable ] ) .    *",
    "1030 + 4309 : * the radio image of 1030 + 4309 shows extensive emission decreasing in surface brightness away from the core , albeit on fairly small ( i.e.  arcsecond ) scales which explains the fairly steady flux measurements across different arrays .",
    "the 8-ghz image reveals the core , the bright peak 2.5 arcseconds to the north and a faint south western extension .",

    "1033 + 4116 : * radio imaging of this object revealed only a hint of an eastern extension at b - array , also seen in the first survey image .",
    "the cause of the variation in the flux density values is most probably source variability .",
    "the true morphology of this source remains inconclusive .",
    "* 1037 + 4650 : * the 1.4-ghz image shows a prominent south western extension , and also an extension to the north east , suggesting this object is a fri source .",
    "the 8-ghz image reflects this , showing the quasar and faint extensions coincident with the ones visible at 1.4ghz and no evidence of any hotspots .    *",
    "1038 + 3729 : * another probable fat double or hybrid source with morphology remarkably similar to that of 1021 + 4523 showing a pair of jets with a southern hotspot and a more diffuse northern counter jet .",
    "the east - west feature seen running between the core and the southern hotspot was coincident with the sidelobe structure of a strong confusing source to the east although , after careful consideration , we think it is unlikely that this feature is an imaging artifact due to its curvature . it is uncertain whether it is associated with the quasar , although radio galaxies have been seen to exhibit unusual _ x_-shaped wing structures ( e.g.  dennett - thorpe et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "the stronger peak on the eastern edge of the map is coincident with a nearby unrelated source .",
    "the jets of this source also appear to be swept back slightly in an easterly direction , possibly a result of motion through the ambient medium .",
    "* 1040 + 4449 : * this object has extended emission similar to that of e1821 + 643 ( blundell & rawlings , 2001 ) and flux density measurements pointing to a fri classification . the slight bend in the major axis",
    "may indicate some motion relative to the surrounding gaseous medium in a north - westerly direction .",
    "* 1040 + 4529 : * it is not possible to draw a definite conclusion as to the nature of this object .",
    "the feature to the east of the quasar may be a faint jet and the vla first survey image hints at a eastern extension , however the flux density values suggest that if there is any diffuse extended emission it is below detectability for the observations presented in this paper .",
    "* 1054 + 4541 : * at a redshift of 2.5 this is the most distant object in the sample .",
    "flux density measurements from different vla arrays suggest there is extended structure associated with this object and there is a hint of oppositely directed jet activity in the radio image .",
    "the extended features in this image are real , but are not coincident with any compact features in a high - resolution merlin image ( heywood et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "* 1057 + 4556 : * the final object in the sample is another highly asymmetric frii classical double .",
    "it is in many was morphologically similar to 1022 + 3931 and 1032 + 4932 , with large differences in separation between the core and each hotspot and what appears to be a diverted plume associated with one hotspot .",
    "figure[fig : rad_z ] shows 151-mhz radio luminosity plotted against redshift for the objects in the sample .",
    "the horizontal lines show the traditional fri / frii break luminosity at 151  mhz assuming spectral indices of 0.5 ( dashed ) and 1.0 ( solid ) .",
    "the curved lines show the detection limits as a function of redshift for a source of flux density 0.1  jy for assumed spectral indices of 0.5 and 1.0 .    by examining this plot",
    "it is evident that there exist fri type sources over a large range in luminosity and above the traditional fri / frii break . if 1037 + 4650 and 1054 + 4541 ( the labelled , filled circles on figure [ fig : rad_z ] ) are indeed bona fide fri sources then the luminosity range for fri type quasars extends to over 10@xmath10  w  hz@xmath3  sr@xmath3 in the cosmology assumed in this paper .",
    "whether these objects are fri sources is not completely certain however it is noteworthy that they are definitely do not have compact hotspots associated with edge - brightened extremities , as would be characteristic of a classical double source .",
    "there is the possibility that these high redshift objects could resemble , for example , b2 1108 + 27 ( owen et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "this source initially appeared to be an arcminute - scale fri - type structure on the basis of the nvss image , however a two hour integration with the vla in d - array revealed that the emission associated with the jets of this object actually extended to an angular size of 30 arcminutes , corresponding to a 1-mpc structure .",
    "it is possible that the radio images of sources such as 1037 + 4650 and 1054 + 4541 presented in this paper simply represent the inner regions of sources similiar to b21108 + 27 .",
    "detection of faint , extended emission around these sources could only be confirmed with subsequent very deep , pointed compact - array observations .",
    "another consideration is the fact that quasars have bright cores and possibly exhibit very strongly beamed emission .",
    "strongly beamed jets may influence the classification of an object by concentrating the emission into a small angular size .",
    "our initial selection however was not made at a frequency at which doppler boosting operates ( e.g. 1.4  ghz ) , but at the lower frequency of 151  mhz which measures on isotropic lobe emission .    if a more cautious approach is adopted and it is assumed that 1037 + 4650 and 1054 + 4541 can not be considered to be fri sources , there are still fri - type twin - jet sources with luminosities of up to 10@xmath11  w  hz@xmath3  sr@xmath3 ( 1030 + 4309 ) , almost a factor of 10 above the traditional fri / frii break .",
    "furthermore , although fri type sources are observed with luminosities over a factor of ten higher than the traditional fri / frii break , there are no frii objects ( with the borderline exception of 1022 + 3931 ) with luminosities significantly below the break .",
    "for this reason we believe that the fri / frii break is still significant as a threshold below which classical doubles are not in general found , although clearly a deeper understanding of fr i evolution is required , building on the existing work on low - luminosity radio sources ( e.g.  clewley & jarvis , 2004 ) .",
    "a second possible explanation for the presence of these high - luminosity fri quasars arises by considering jet power and the environment surrounding the object",
    ". a low power jet will only give rise to an fri type structure since the flow is subsonic .",
    "shock fronts do not occur when the material collides with the intergalactic medium and therefore no hotspots are ever formed at the jet extremities .",
    "it is postulated here that high power jets can however give rise to both fri and frii morphologies depending on their environment . for",
    "a smooth and rarefied local environment a high power jet can continue relatively unhindered and remain collimated until it strikes the boundary with the igm , resulting in shock fronts and the increased brightness hotspots which characterise a frii classical double . for a dense or clumpy local environment the jet may lose much of its momentum and dissipate its energy in a more gradual fashion resulting in an fri type object .    at higher redshift",
    "the enivronments surrounding active galactic nuclei may well be denser and clumpier than those of the local universe .",
    "jets associated with high redshift environments would be more prone to disruption than those associated with objects in the local universe , thus only well collimated , high power jets would produce frii type structures ( barthel & miley , 1988 ) .",
    "the most obvious conclusion that can be drawn from these results is that e1821 + 643 is not a unique exception as an fri quasar and that fri quasars not uncommon amongst populations selected to be both radio - loud and quasars : objects with broad emission lines can give rise to fri structures , which apparently have low power radio jets .",
    "the two classes of radio morphology described by fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) appear to apply to quasars , in that quasars exist in both fri and ii categories .",
    "however , our results also show that there is no sharp transition across a certain luminosity as we observe fri quasars with luminosities at least a factor of 10 above the traditional fri / frii break .",
    "the source 1023 + 4824 is the only object in the sample to show a _ clear _ classical double morphology .",
    "three sources which are dominated by core and hotspot emission and could therefore be thought of as hybrid frii classical double sources exhibit obvious similarities ( 1022 + 3931 , 1032 + 4932 and 1057 + 4556 ) .",
    "all three of these feature a double hotspot and are highly asymmetric about the core .",
    "generally the sources are either fri twin jet ( or fri-_like _ ) sources ( e.g.  1023 + 3604 , 1030 + 3346 , 1030 + 4309 , 1037 + 4650 , 1040 + 4449 ) or unusual hybrid or fat double sources ( e.g.  1009 + 4655 , 1021 + 4523 , 1038 + 3729 ) .",
    "most objects observed at @xmath12 in the 7c quasar survey are fris ( see figure [ fig : rad_z ] ) , and lie below the traditional fri / frii break in luminosity . the lack of fri quasars in the 3c survey may be due , at least in part , to rarity issues . although the comoving volumes probed by 3crr and 7c are comparable ( 3crr probes @xmath11  @xmath13  10@xmath14  mpc@xmath15 to a redshift of 0.1 , 7c probes @xmath12  @xmath13  10@xmath14  mpc@xmath15 to a redshift of 0.6 ) , quasars are more numerous at @xmath12 than at @xmath16",
    ". however , it does seem from studies of complete samples of radio sources at @xmath12 ( mclure et al .",
    ", 2004 ; mitchell , 2005 ) that a typical l@xmath1710@xmath18  w  hz@xmath3  sr@xmath3 radio source at @xmath12 has a fri radio structure but has neither an observed quasar nucleus ( as signified by , for example , the presence of broad h@xmath19 emission lines ) nor evidence for any buried nucleus of comparable intrinsic luminosity ( inferred , e.g. , from strong narrow emission lines ) .",
    "again with reference to figure [ fig : rad_z ] , at @xmath20 we seem to generally observe fr i - like structures . in the 7c quasar survey , fr i objects exist at higher radio luminosities ( 10@xmath21  w  hz@xmath3",
    "sr@xmath3 ) than those observed in the 3c survey at low redshift . there is thus evidence that the division between fri and frii radio sources changes with @xmath8 , in the sense that fris can exist above the traditional break luminosity at higher redshifts .",
    "the obvious explanation for this ( which is therefore also likely to affect the @xmath22 population ) is a systematic change in the environments of radio sources with cosmic epoch ( see section 4.2 ) .    for the objects at @xmath23",
    "the data presented here have shown that the furthest extents of these sources are not coincident with hotspots , but it remains open as to whether these objects are truly fr is or have , for instance , disrupted or precessing jets .",
    "further high resolution radio imaging would be useful to resolve such questions .",
    "disproving the idea that fri radio structures can not be associated with a quasar ( i.e. an acccreting black hole central engine ) is quite an important conclusion .",
    "it has recently become clear from surveys with spitzer ( e.g. martinez - sansigre et al . ,",
    "2005 ) that most quasar activity , and hence black hole growth , in the universe has been missed by optical and x - ray surveys due to obscuration by dust and gas .",
    "many of these obscured quasars have radio luminosities and spectral indices consistent with the hypothesis that they are associated with fri - like radio jets ( martinez - sansigre et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "the objects observed in this paper may be unobscured examples of the same phenomenon .",
    "the growth of supermassive black holes may thus go hand - in - hand with fri - like jet output which may have critical effects on the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. croton et al . , 2005 ) and larger - scale structures .",
