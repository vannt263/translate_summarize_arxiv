    "experimental evidence suggests that the size of grains and subgrains in plastically deformed solids is not random , but rather relates inversely to the flow stress , @xmath0 see @xcite .",
    "the foundations of this heuristic law are a long - standing open problem in materials science and solid mechanics .",
    "the qualitative and quantitative prediction of @xmath1 is particularly vexing in dynamic recrystallisation ( drx ) , where new grains essentially free of dislocations nucleate out of a highly fatigued sample .",
    "the experimental studies @xcite on drx show that the recrystallized grain sizes can be linked to the subgrain size although the dependency of dynamically recrystallized grain size and subgrain size on flow stress is different .",
    "derby and ashby @xcite , and roberts et al . ,",
    "@xcite , addressed the grain size by making assumptions on the relevant criteria like back stresses at grain boundaries or imbalance of subgrain size across prior grain boundaries but did not touch the issue of mechanical behavior .",
    "a survey on the effect of diffusion on grain boundaries can be found in @xcite .    evidently , despite extensive research during the past decades ,",
    "the physical mechanisms of grain formation are not yet understood .",
    "the subject is not only of academic interest but is also of immense importance for industrial processing , see e.g. @xcite , since treatments like hot rolling , cold rolling and annealing require reliable predictions of the microstructure and the texture evolution .    in this article , without spurious assumptions or introducing an artificial mechanism , we show in a mathematically rigorous way why patterning in deformed solids may occur . to develop our argument",
    "we compute analytically in special cases the state of a solid that is deformed along its boundary .",
    "we formulate the problem within the finite - strain cosserat model of plasticity .",
    "the interesting feature of this model , unlike other established approaches in visco - plasticity , see the research articles and surveys @xcite , is that it is a _ gradient model _ ,",
    "i.e. a length scale is introduced .",
    "the results given here substantiate this property : it is demonstrated how for a certain parameter range the analytic solutions naturally lead to transition layers between areas of approximately constant micro - rotations @xmath2 , a parameter that specifies the local orientation of the material .",
    "this paper is organised in the following way . in section  [ secmodel ]",
    "we revise the rate - independent finite - strain cosserat model as needed later and formulate an energy minimisation procedure that allows to obtain the time - discrete solution .",
    "we then restrict the plastic deformations to a priori given single - slip systems and adopt the formulation accordingly . in section  [ secspecial",
    "] , we apply the resulting model to a simple shear problem in 2d .",
    "the two - dimensional setting is chosen as this permits the representation of the rotations by one scalar parameter . in the following section [ secsol ] some exact solutions to this shear problem",
    "are computed with focus on the properties of the micro - rotations @xmath2 . as main result ,",
    "two non - trivial examples are discussed where @xmath2 is connected with the solutions of a stationary allen - cahn equation .",

    ", @xmath19 need not be symmetric and positive definite , i.e. ( [ decomp2 ] ) is _ not _ the polar decomposition .    introducing the dislocation density @xmath20 ,",
    "frame indifference ( which amounts here to the invariance of the energy under rigid body motions ) implies that the mechanical energy density is the sum of three functionals , @xmath21 with the stretching part @xmath22 , the curvature part @xmath23 , and the energy due to immobilised dislocations @xmath24 . with @xmath25",
    "we designate the third - order ( right ) curvature tensor .",

    "a first investigation in 3d using finite - element computations is done in @xcite . in this work",

    "another very important question left to future work is the study of @xmath190-minimisers , characterised by @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the absolute minimal value of @xmath52 and @xmath193 a small number .",
    "this notion goes along with the insight that most of the time , the solutions observed in experiments do not reach a global minimum . if an almost optimal micro - rotation @xmath194 solves the time - dependent allen - cahn equation ( [ ac ] ) for large but finite time @xmath195 , this may pave the way for quantitative studies since the coarsening laws of the allen - cahn equation are well known .",
