    ", a permutation of the agents is chosen uniformly at random and then agents in the permutation are given the most preferred object that is still not allocated .",
    "the reason rsd is a compelling mechanism for the assignment problem is because it is strategyproof and also ex post efficient ( the outcome can be represented as convex combination of deterministic pareto optimal outcomes ) .",
    "in fact , it has even been conjectured that rsd is the only mechanism that satisfies anonymity , strategyproofness and ex post efficiency  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although rsd is a desirable mechanism , @xcite showed that rsd is not sd - efficient ( efficiency with respect to stochastic dominance ) .",
    "the observation was surprising because sd - efficiency is a very undemanding property . to highlight this point , note that if an assignment is not sd - efficient , then there exists another assignment in which for all cardinal utilities consistent with the ordinal preferences , all agents get at least as much utility and one agent gets strictly more utility . in this note , we explore the lack of sd - efficiency of rsd and present an elemetary and detailed argument for the following theorem .    for a given preference profile , the rsd assignment is not sd - efficient if and only if there exists an ex post assignment that is not sd - efficient .",
