    "the flow of two immiscible fluids through porous media arises in many important industrial and natural situations such as secondary oil recovery , ground water remediation , and geological @xmath0 storage .",
    "such flows are known to be potentially unstable , especially when the displacing fluid is more viscous than the displaced one . there",
    "exist some similarities between porous media and hele - shaw flows ( i.e. flow in a hele - shaw cell , see below ) ; for example the pressure drop in both such flows are governed by darcy s law for single fluid flow . due to this and the fact that it is significantly easier to study hele - shaw flows theoretically , numerically , and experimentally , there have been numerous theoretical and numerical studies even for hele - shaw flow of two immiscible fluids since the early 1950s , starting with the work of saffman and taylor  @xcite .",
    "there are many review articles on such studies , for example see @xcite .",
    "these studies were originally motivated by displacement processes arising in secondary oil recovery , even though these studies have much wider appeal in the sciences and engineering . in the late 1970s , tertiary displacement processes involved in chemical",
    "enhanced oil recovery generated interest in three - layer and multi - layer hele - shaw flows ( see @xcite ) .    in this paper , we first briefly derive the non - standard eigenvalue problem . this eigenvalue problem has been derived earlier by the first author and his collaborators ; for example see  @xcite .",
    "but the difference is that the derivation presented here is more general and shows how to generate higher order correction terms if necessary in order to study the effect of nonlinear terms that may dominate the dynamics , particularly in view of the sensitivity of fingering problems to finite amplitude perturbations .",
    "however , we do not study or discuss such nonlinear effects in this paper which will be taken up in the future as it falls outside the scope of this paper .",
    "we then analytically study this non - standard eigenvalue problem using non - linear transformation for the case when the viscous profile of the middle layer is linear .",
    "we will see below that this case is relatively hard to study in comparison to the case when the viscous profile is exponential which we have recently addressed in @xcite .        the physical set - up consists of rectilinear motion of three immiscible fluids in a hele - shaw cell which is a device separating two parallel plates by a distance @xmath1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hs_rect_linearprofile ] ) .",
    "the fluid in the extreme left layer @xmath2 with viscosity @xmath3 extends up to @xmath4 , the fluid in the extreme right layer @xmath5 with viscosity @xmath6 extends up to @xmath7 , and the fluid in the middle - layer @xmath8 of finite length @xmath9 has a smooth viscous profile with viscosity increasing in the direction of displacement .",
    "the interfacial tensions of the leading and the trailing interfaces are given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "it is well established that this hele - shaw flow is similar to flow in homogeneous porous media with equivalent permeability @xmath12 . without any loss of generality ,",
    "we take this to be one below .",
    "the mathematical model considered here consists of conservation of mass , darcy s law and advection equation for viscosity .",
    "thus we have @xmath13 due to the continuity equation , we can define the stream function @xmath14 such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this then implies that @xmath17 since @xmath18 when @xmath19 , we consider a small perturbation of the basic scalar fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the form @xmath22 substituting into the original equations , we get the following @xmath23 and @xmath24 equations.@xmath23 equations : @xmath25 these equations provide the basic solution given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an arbitrary function of @xmath28 , meaning the viscous profile is fixed with respect to a moving frame moving at a constant velocity @xmath29.@xmath24 equations : @xmath30 now , introducing the moving frame change of variables , namely @xmath31 , we get the following system of equations .",
    "@xmath32 taking cross derivatives of the first two equations with respect to @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively and then subtracting the resulting equations from each other gives @xmath35 this combined with the equation @xmath36 leads to @xmath37 using the ansatz @xmath38 in the above equation together with the appropriate boundary conditions ( see @xcite ) give the following eigenvalue problem . @xmath39",

    "this is a non - standard eigenvalue problem in that the spectral parameter @xmath41 appe ars in the equation as well as in the boundary conditions .",
    "recently , this problem has been numerically solved by daripa  @xcite for a constant viscous profile and by daripa & ding  @xcite for non - constant viscous profiles @xmath42 to determine the most optimal profile , i.e. , the least unstable profile .",
    "this problem has been too difficult to solve analytically for non - constant profiles .",
    "progress made in this direction for the linear viscous profile is presented below .    in this paper",
    "we consider a linear viscous profile for the intermediate fluid region given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are jump discontinuity values at the interfaces @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . in the left region",
    "the problem reduces to @xmath48 which has solution @xmath49 . in the right region",
    "the problem reduces to @xmath50 which has solution @xmath51 in the intermediate region the problem reduces to @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the spectral parameter and @xmath54",
    "we introduce the nonlinear transformation and change of variables given by @xmath55 after some manipulation of the eigenvalue problem using the above transformation , we obtain the following eigenvalue problem for the kummer s equation  @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 where a prime denotes derivative , @xmath58 the eigenvalue problem is a regular two point boundary value problem for each wave number @xmath59 .",
    "one solution @xmath60 of the kummer s equation is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63.this is an analytic solution .",
    "it is easily seen that the derivative of this solution which we will need below for the dispersion relation is given by @xmath64 the linearly independent second solution is easily constructed by the method of frobenius .",
    "avoiding all the details , the second solution @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67  .",
    "its derivative which we will need below is then given by @xmath68 the general solution of the kummer s equation is then given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are arbitrary constants .",
    "substituting the general solution into the two boundary conditions of the eigenvalue problem , we obtain the following linear system of equations for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 therefore , for a non - trivial solution we have @xmath73 this formally gives the dispersion relation @xmath74 in terms of the problem data : @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    in terms of the original variables",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath34 , the fundamental solutions @xmath78 and @xmath79 are then given by ( see ) @xmath80 where @xmath81 also , recall that @xmath28 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "noticing that both series are centered at @xmath84 and applying the ratio test for series for @xmath78 above , we have @xmath85 for any @xmath34 fixed .",
    "thus the series for @xmath78 converges absolutely @xmath86 , but the series _ evaluated _ at @xmath84 reduces to 1 .",
    "this implies that the radius of this series is @xmath87 .",
    "hence @xmath88 and since it is an alternating singular series , the error @xmath89 in approximating @xmath90 by terms up to @xmath91 is smaller than the last neglected term , namely @xmath92 for a fixed @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , applying the ratio test to the series for @xmath79 , @xmath93 for any @xmath34 .",
    "thus the series inside the brackets converges absolutely @xmath94 , but the series inside the brackets evaluated at @xmath95 reduces to 1 .",
    "therefore , the radius of convergence of the series within the brackets is @xmath87 .",
    "hence @xmath96 notice that @xmath79 has a branch point at @xmath97 . in any case , since the series within the brackets is an alternating sign series , if we truncate it , the error @xmath98 is smaller than the last neglected term , i.e. , @xmath99 the general solution of the ode @xmath100 is then given by @xmath101 .",
    "the boundary values of @xmath102 follow from and whi ch are now given by @xmath103 substituting these in the boundary conditions @xmath104 , we obtain the following system of equations for the constants @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 . for the existence of nontrivial solutions",
    ", we then have @xmath108 which gives us the dispersion relation in the form : @xmath109 . because of the nature of the series solutions given above , it is not possible to give this dispersion relation explicitly .",
    "there are an infinite number of eigenvalues @xmath110 ( recall @xmath111 ) which can be ordered : @xmath112 . we know that these infinite number of eigenvalues should reduce to ( i ) only two in the limit @xmath113 corresponding to the constant viscosity of the intermediate layer fluid  ( see daripa  @xcite ) ; ( ii ) only one in the limit @xmath114 ( see saffman & taylor  @xcite , daripa  @xcite ) and ( iii ) only two in the limit of @xmath115 ( see daripa  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , we also know the eigenvalues in these limiting cases from the pure saffman - taylor growth rate of individual interfaces . these results by no means are transparent from the solutions of the eigenvalue problem   given in the previous section .",
    "below , we show how to recover these limit solutions ( eigenvalues ) from the infinite number of eigenvalues for the linear viscous profile .      in this case , the eigenvalue problem   reduces to @xmath117 in this case , the change of variable introduced previously , namely @xmath118 , which converts the equation  @xmath100 to kummer s equation , i s not well - defined .",
    "therefore we work with the boundary value problem  @xmath119 .",
    "now , consider the general solution of the ode in ( [ slp3 ] ) @xmath120 such that @xmath121 therefore , we get @xmath122 we search for a solution of the boundary value problem ( [ slp3 ] ) of the form @xmath123 to find a solution of ( [ slp3 ] ) of this form , we start determining the coefficients using the shooting technique such that the boundary condition at @xmath46 is satisfied . obviously , the coefficients @xmath124 and @xmath125 depend on the parameter @xmath126 .",
    "then , we find @xmath126 in such a way that the solution satisfies the boundary condition at @xmath47 .",
    "hence , we look for @xmath124 and @xmath125 such that @xmath127 then it follows directly from ( [ cond1 ] ) that @xmath128 and @xmath129 therefore @xmath130 satisfies the ode in and the boundary condition at @xmath46 . from these",
    "it follows that the spectrum of problem ( [ slp3 ] ) can be studied using the following algebraic equation ( see @xmath131 ) @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the function defined in .",
    "evaluating @xmath134 and @xmath135 from and substituting directly in one obtains @xmath136 then , taking @xmath137 one obtains @xmath138 which is equivalent to the equation @xmath139 since @xmath140 ( @xmath141 or @xmath142 ) , it follows that @xmath143 now , using the definition of the coefficient @xmath144 given in ( [ coef ] ) we have @xmath145 \\lambda =- k(\\mu_{1}+\\mu_{2})\\ ] ] from which it follows that @xmath146 which is the formula for the growth rate of an interface with surface tension @xmath147 , which is what should be expected in this limit .",
    "thus we recover the classical formula for the growth rate in this limit .",
    "to take the limit when @xmath148 , we go back to equation ( [ explicitall ] ) and write it as follows @xmath149 now , taking the limit when @xmath150 , we obtain @xmath151 using @xmath152 and expressions for the coefficients from @xmath153 , we obtain @xmath154 finally , since @xmath155 ( @xmath141 or @xmath142 ) it follows that @xmath156 which gives the classical formula for saffman - taylor instability of the leading interface . similarly , we can recover the the classical formula for saffman - taylor instability of the trailin g interface by reversing the shooting technique ( see after ) , i.e. , first find the solution which is analogous to but satisfies the boundary condition at @xmath47 instead and then shoot to satisfy the boundary condition at @xmath46 ( i.e. , replace by a similar formula derived from the boundary condition at @xmath46 and follow the procedure ) .      in this section , we study asymptotic limits ( @xmath158 and @xmath148 ) of the solutions to the eigenvalue problem  . to this end",
    ", we consider the following form of two linearly independent solutions of kummer s equation @xmath159 .",
    "these are convenient for the asymptotic analysis presented below .",
    "@xmath160 where @xmath161 is euler s digamma function ( see abramowitz  @xcite , chapter 13 ) .    to this end",
    ", we follow the steps presented in the previous section  [ subsection : constant - viscosity ] for the particular case @xmath140 ( @xmath141 or @xmath142 ) . from the transformation in",

    "similar to the procedure of the previous section  [ subsection : constant - viscosity ] , we find @xmath124 and @xmath125 so that @xmath172 and @xmath173",
    ". therefore , it follows from and that @xmath174 and therefore @xmath175 and @xmath176 . substituting these constants in the function @xmath133 defined by , we obtain a solution of the ode that satisfies the boundary condition at @xmath46 of the eigenvalue problem .",
    "since @xmath124 and @xmath125 depend on the spectral parameter @xmath126 , it follows that the eigenvalues of the problem can be obtained by studying the following algebraic equation which is a reformulation of the boundary condition at @xmath47 of the eigenvalue problem .",
    "@xmath177 since the right - hand side of the above equation does not depend on @xmath9 , we need to study the asymptotic limits ( @xmath178 and @xmath148 ) of the lefthand side of ( [ al2 ] ) .",
    "notice that the expression @xmath179 above is given by ( see ) @xmath180 therefore , we first find the asymptotic approximations for @xmath181 , and @xmath182 in both cases below before estimating the ratio @xmath183 using for its use in .",
