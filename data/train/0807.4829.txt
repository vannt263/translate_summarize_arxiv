    "in a recent paper  @xcite , silva & steinberg for any finite semigroup @xmath0 define the _ cayley automaton @xmath3 _ associated with @xmath0 : its state set is @xmath0 ; the alphabet , on which the states act , is @xmath0 ; and when @xmath3 is in state @xmath4 and reads symbol @xmath5 , it moves to the state @xmath6 and outputs the symbol @xmath6 . in other words",
    ", this is the automaton obtained from the cayley graph of @xmath0 , specifying the output symbol on the arc , going from @xmath4 and labeled by @xmath5 , to be @xmath6 .    as to every automaton , to the automaton @xmath3 we can associate its automaton semigroup @xmath7 , i.e. the transformation semigroup on infinite sequences @xmath8 , generated by states @xmath9 viewed as the correspondent transformations of @xmath8 . in  @xcite silva & steinberg prove the following    [ th : cayley - groups ] let @xmath10 be a finite non - trivial group .",
    "then @xmath11 is a free semigroup of rank @xmath12 .",
    "the author and alan cain after reading  @xcite decided to study semigroups @xmath7 in more details . in  @xcite we characterized when @xmath7 is free , commutative , trivial , a left or a right zero semigroup .",
    "but the most interesting result we obtain in  @xcite is :    [ th : ours ] let @xmath0 be a finite semigroup .",
    "then @xmath7 is finite if and only if @xmath0 is @xmath2-trivial .",
    "the sufficiency of theorem  [ th : ours ] was proved in a recent work  @xcite . while the author and alan cain where preparing  @xcite",
    ", we did not know about the work  @xcite .",
    "the sufficiency of theorem  [ th : ours ] is the harder bit of this result .",
    "we provided in  @xcite two different proofs of sufficiency of theorem  [ th : ours ] : using the method of actions on sequences and using the method of wreath recursions .",
    "these two approaches and the method from  @xcite are all different in their realizations but bear the same spirit : the aim was to find an ultimate constant @xmath13 such that any product of states from @xmath3 of length @xmath13 can be reduced to a shorter word .",
    "now , if in the cayley graph of a finite semigroup @xmath0 , instead of the output symbol @xmath6 we put the symbol @xmath14 , we arrive at the _ dual cayley automaton @xmath15 _ : the state and alphabet sets being @xmath0 and when @xmath15 is in state @xmath4 and reads symbol @xmath5 , it moves to the state @xmath6 and outputs the symbol @xmath14 .",
    "denote by @xmath1 the automaton semigroup generated by the automaton @xmath15 .",
    "the main result of the note is    [ th : dual - cute ] let @xmath0 be a finite semigroup . then @xmath1 is finite if and only if @xmath0 is @xmath2-trivial and does not contain non - trivial right zero subsemigroups .",
    "we prove theorem  [ th : dual - cute ] in section  [ sec : finiteness ] .",
    "the way we do it differs from the way of proving theorem  [ th : ours ] : there will be no need to deal with ` long ' words and trying to reduce their lengths . the author hopes to exhibit the power of the method of wreath recursions .",
    "before we start the proof , in the next section we give all the auxiliary notation and lemmas we will need .",
    "in order to distinguish the states and symbols in @xmath15 , we will write @xmath16 to denote the state correspondent to @xmath9 . if @xmath17 , it is convenient to realize @xmath16 via the _ wreath recursion _ ( see  @xcite ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , given by @xmath20 , corresponds to the action of @xmath16 on the symbols @xmath0 , and @xmath21 is the state where @xmath16 moves after reading the symbol @xmath22 .    if @xmath23 and @xmath24 then by @xmath25 we will denote the state , to which @xmath26 moves after reading @xmath23 . the transition function of @xmath26 on @xmath0 we will denote by @xmath27 .",
    "so , @xmath28 and for all @xmath23 , @xmath29 is the symbol which outputs @xmath15 , reading @xmath5 in the state @xmath26 . by definition , for all @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 also the corresponding transition function @xmath32 is @xmath33 .",
    "[ lm : aux ] let @xmath0 be a finite semigroup .",
    "then for all @xmath34 , @xmath35 in @xmath36 if and only if @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath34 .",
    "then @xmath35 if and only if @xmath37 and @xmath38 for all @xmath23 . recursing the latter",
    ", we obtain that @xmath35 if and only if @xmath37 and @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .",
    "it remains to notice that if @xmath37 , then @xmath39 for all @xmath23 .    in the following three lemmas",
    "we collect some information about @xmath36 for specific types of @xmath0 .",

    "then @xmath41 is infinite .",
    "take any non - identity element @xmath42 .",
    "then @xmath43 is a non - trivial commutative group .",
    "obviously the restrictions of the action of the state @xmath44 , @xmath45 , to @xmath46 , is the same as the action of @xmath44 in @xmath47 .",
    "notice that @xmath48 and so , by theorem  [ th : cayley - groups ] , @xmath49 is a free system .",
    "thus @xmath41 is infinite .",
    "[ lm : something ] let @xmath50 be a finite left zero semigroup and @xmath0 be a finite semigroup .",
    "then @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath52 .",
    "then it follows from lemma  [ lm : aux ] that @xmath53 in @xmath54 .",
    "hence @xmath54 coincides with @xmath55 for any fixed @xmath56 .",
    "it is now easy to check that @xmath57 gives rise to an isomorphism from @xmath58 onto @xmath36 .",
    "[ lm : again - right ] let @xmath59 be a finite right zero semigroup with @xmath60 . then @xmath61 is a free semigroup of rank @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "a direct calculation shows that @xmath65 is the automaton @xmath66 of the type :        we will prove now that the automaton semigroup generated by the automaton @xmath66 is free of rank @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath66 has just read a symbol @xmath68 , then it has just entered state @xmath69 and its _ next _ output symbol will be @xmath68 .",
    "thus the action of @xmath69 is to send a sequence @xmath26 to @xmath70 : the sequence @xmath26 is shifted right by one symbol and the symbol @xmath68 is inserted at the start .",
    "so if @xmath71 with @xmath72 , then @xmath73 the common prefix of @xmath74 and @xmath75 thus determines @xmath76 and so the automaton semigroup generated by @xmath66 is free with the basis @xmath59 .",
    "the following lemma is standard to prove , we include it for completeness .",
    "[ lm : d - class ] let @xmath0 be a finite semigroup and let @xmath77 .",

    "obviously @xmath89 is a group @xmath2-class in @xmath0 if and only if @xmath90 is a group @xmath2-class in @xmath87 .",
    "we have that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are @xmath81-equivalent in @xmath87 .",
    "this happen only if @xmath93 in @xmath87 .",
    "so that @xmath90 is a group and so @xmath89 is a group in @xmath0 .",
    "therefore @xmath94 and so @xmath95 has an idempotent . by clifford - miller theorem",
    "it now follows that @xmath96 .",
    "first notice that the condition that @xmath0 does not contain non - trivial right zero subsemigroups is equivalent to the condition that there are no two distinct idempotents @xmath97 such that @xmath98 .",

    "take @xmath103 and consider the restriction of @xmath116 to @xmath46 . from the very definition of @xmath105",
    ", it follows that the mapping @xmath117 gives rise to a well - defined homomorphism from @xmath118 onto @xmath119 . by lemma  [ lm :",
    "easy - to - death - or - even - easier ] , it means that @xmath120 is infinite .",
    "thus @xmath1 is infinite , a contradiction .",
    "suppose the converse : that there exist two idempotents @xmath121 with @xmath98 .",
    "then @xmath122 is a @xmath123-element right zero semigroup . restricting the action of @xmath124 and @xmath125 to @xmath126 yields the automaton @xmath127 . by lemma  [ lm : again - right ]",
    ", it follows now that @xmath128 is a free semigroup of rank @xmath123 , a contradiction .",
    "we will prove by induction on @xmath130 that if @xmath0 is @xmath2-trivial and every its @xmath131-class contains at most one idempotent , then @xmath36 is finite .",
    "the base case @xmath132 is obvious .",
    "assume that we have proved this for all such semigroups of size @xmath133 .",
    "take now any semigroup @xmath0 with the assumption of sufficiency of the theorem such that @xmath134 .",
    "let @xmath135 be the set of all maximal @xmath81-classes in @xmath0 , and let @xmath136 be the complement of all these @xmath81-classes in @xmath0 .",
    "suppose first that @xmath137 .",
    "then @xmath0 consists of a single @xmath81-class and so @xmath0 is a rees matrix semigroup @xmath138 $ ] for some group @xmath10 and a @xmath139-matrix @xmath140 .",
    "since @xmath0 is @xmath2-trivial , we have that @xmath141 .",
    "moreover , by  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.4.2 ) , we may assume that there exists a column in @xmath142 consisting entirely of the element @xmath143 .",
    "since columns in @xmath142 correspond to @xmath131-classes in @xmath0 , we obtain that @xmath144 .",
    "so , again by  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.4.2 ) , it now holds that @xmath145 is a left zero semigroup .",
    "then by lemma  [ lm : something ] , @xmath36 is trivial .",
    "it suffices to prove that there are finitely many products @xmath149 for any fixed @xmath150 .",
    "we have that @xmath151 and @xmath152 are distinct if and only if the restrictions of @xmath153 and @xmath154 on @xmath155 coincide .",
    "notice that @xmath156 .",
    "obviously @xmath153 and @xmath154 act on @xmath157 in the same way as the correspondent products from @xmath158 do .",
    "now the claim of step 1 follows from the induction hypothesis .",
    "take a typical element @xmath160 .",
    "then for all @xmath23 , we have @xmath161 having that @xmath136 is an ideal in @xmath0 , we deduce that @xmath162 .",

    ", we have @xmath167 obviously , to prove step 3 , it suffices to show that there are only finitely many expressions @xmath168 for all @xmath169 and @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , by step 2 , it even suffices to show finiteness of the set @xmath170 of all such expressions @xmath168 with additional requirement that @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "( otherwise @xmath173 and so @xmath168 comes from the finite set @xmath174 . )    observe that if @xmath175 do not come from the same @xmath81-class from @xmath135 , for some @xmath68 , then @xmath176 .",
