    "searches for single top - quark production via the neutral current ( nc ) , @xmath0 have been performed by the h1 collaboration @xcite and the zeus collaboration @xcite at the desy electron - proton collider hera .",
    "the h1 collaboration found several events , leading to a cross section of @xmath1  pb .",
    "alternatively , assuming that the observed events are due to a statistical fluctuation , upper limits of 0.55  pb on @xmath2 and of 0.27 on the anomalous @xmath3 coupling @xmath4 were established at the 95% confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "on the other hand , the zeus collaboration found no evidence for top - quark production and was able to place upper bounds of 0.225  pb on @xmath2 and of 0.174 on @xmath4 at 95% cl .",
    "single top - quark production via the charged current ( cc ) is possible at the tree level , but its cross section is less than 1  fb @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such events can be separated experimentally due to the absence of a scattered electron or positron in the final state .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the cross section of process  ( [ eq : had ] ) in the standard model ( sm ) and its minimal supersymmetric ( susy ) extension ( mssm ) , considering both scenarios with minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) and non - minimal flavour violation ( nmfv ) .",
    "the bulk of the cross section is due to photoproduction and electromagnetic deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) , while the contribution due to the exchange of a virtual @xmath5 boson is greatly suppressed by its mass .",
    "since photonic interactions can not change flavour and the top quark does not appear as a parton in the proton , we are dealing here with a loop - induced process . in the sm and the mfv mssm ,",
    "its cross section is further suppressed by the smallness of the contributing elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix . in more general mssm scenarios ,",
    "misalignment between the quark and squark sectors can appear , and the ckm matrix is no longer the only source of flavour violation .",
    "thus , the flavour - changing ( fc ) couplings are not cabibbo suppressed , and sizeable contributions to fc nc processes can occur . on the other hand , there are strong experimental bounds on squark mixing involving the first generation , coming from data on @xmath6@xmath7 and @xmath8@xmath9 mixing @xcite . if the squark mixing involving the first generation is neglected completely , there are no new vertices for incoming up - quarks compared to the mfv mssm .",
    "thus , every new contribution in this scenario is suppressed by the parton distribution function ( pdf ) of the charm quark in the proton . because the sm cross section for nc single top - quark production is highly suppressed ,",
    "every detected event is an indication of physics beyond the sm .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : two ] , we describe the analytical calculation of the sm cross section . in section",
    "[ sec : three ] , we outline the theoretical framework of fc interactions in the mssm .",

    "in this section , the analytical calculation of the sm cross section is described . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ overview ] , we denote the four - momenta of the incoming proton , parton ( up or charm quark ) , and electron by @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively , and those of the outgoing top quark and electron by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . as for the centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy and the top - quark mass , we have @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we neglect the masses of the proton , the incoming quarks , and the electron , so that @xmath17",
    ". the four - momentum of the exchanged photon is given by @xmath18 , and , as usual , we introduce the virtuality variable @xmath19 .",
    "the variable @xmath20 measures the relative electron energy loss in the proton rest frame .",
    "single top - quark production in nc dis occurs via the partonic subprocess @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "the feynman diagrams contributing in the sm to process  ( [ eq : sub ] ) with @xmath23 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ feynmansm ] .",
    "the ones for @xmath24 are similar .",
    "the amplitude of this processes was also calculated in ref .",
    "there appears at least one off - diagonal element of the ckm matrix in each term .",
    "if the contributions of the inner - quark flavours to a single feynman diagram are added up and their masses are neglected , the amplitude of this feynman diagram vanishes due to the unitarity of the ckm matrix .",
    "thus , we can not neglect the inner - quark masses here .",
    "although our choice @xmath25 appears unphysical at first sight , it is inconsequential in practice .",
    "in fact , we verified that the use of a realistic value of @xmath26 affects our numerical results only insignificantly .",
    "a detailed proof of hard - scattering factorisation with the inclusion of heavy - quark masses may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our calculation proceeds along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite . the differential cross section of process  ( [ eq : sub ] ) reads @xmath27 where @xmath28 , defined as @xmath29 , is the fraction of the proton momentum passed on to the incoming quark and @xmath30 is the squared amplitude averaged ( summed ) over the spin and colour degrees of freedom of the initial - state ( final - state ) particles . the kinematically allowed ranges of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are @xmath33 where @xmath34 defines the demarcation between photoproduction and electroproduction and @xmath35 is an experimental acceptance cut . in ref .",

    "the hadronic cross section of process  ( [ eq : had ] ) is obtained by convoluting the partonic cross section of process  ( [ eq : sub ] ) with the appropriate pdf @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the factorisation scale , and summing over @xmath22 , as @xmath41 there are two candidate mass scales for @xmath40 , namely @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and the optimal choice is likely to lie somewhere in between , at @xmath44 say . at any rate",
    ", we have @xmath45 , so that charm is an active quark flavour in the initial state , contributing at full strength via its pdf .",

    "we generate and evaluate the feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ feynmansm ] , with the virtual - photon leg amputated , with the help of the program packages _ feynarts _ @xcite and _ formcalc _ @xcite .",
    "we work in t  hooft - feynman gauge and use dimensional regularisation to extract the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences .",
    "we perform the passarino - veltman reduction and calculate the squared amplitude ( [ msquared ] ) using the program package _",
    "for the numerical evaluation of the standard scalar one - loop integrals , we employ the program package _ looptools _ @xcite .",

    "all three independent calculations are found to lead to the same result .",
    "furthermore , we verify the cancellation of the uv divergences , current conservation , and the reality of the squared amplitude .      in the photoproduction limit , the virtual photon is considered as real , with @xmath56 , so that the longitudinal part of the cross section vanishes . in turn , its energy distribution is described in the weizscker - williams approximation by the electron - to - photon splitting function @xmath57,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is sommerfeld s fine - structure constant , @xmath59 is the electron mass , and @xmath60 corresponds to the kinematic lower bound .",
    "thus , the cross section of process  ( [ eq : sub ] ) in photoproduction is given by @xmath61 with @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the amplitude of @xmath64 .",
    "the kinematically allowed range of @xmath32 is @xmath65 the hadronic cross section is again obtained by convoluting the partonic cross section for a given incoming quark with the corresponding pdf and summing over the incoming - quark flavours . here",
    ", the only candidate mass scale for @xmath40 is of order @xmath43 , and it is plausible to choose @xmath66 so that there is a smooth transition between photoproduction and electroproduction .",
    "again , we have @xmath45 , so that the use of a charm pdf is justified .",
    "in the mssm , there are two sources of fc phenomena @xcite .",
    "the first one is due to flavour mixing in the quark sector , just as in the sm .",
    "it is produced by the different flavour rotations in the up- and down - quark sectors , and its strength is driven by the off - diagonal ckm matrix elements .",
    "this mixing produces fc electroweak ( ew ) interaction terms involving ccs , now also involving charged higgs bosons , and susy ew interaction terms of the chargino - quark - squark type .",
    "thus , the sm feynman diagrams of fig .  [ feynmansm ] are supplemented by those shown in fig .",
    "[ feynmanmfv ] , in which either charged higgs bosons and down - type quarks or charginos and down - type squarks circulate in the loops . in the mfv mssm , this is the only source of fc phenomena beyond the sm .",
    "the second source of fc phenomena , which is present in the nmfv mssm , is due to the possible misalignment between the rotations that diagonalise the quark and squark sectors .",
    "when the squark mass matrix is expressed in the basis where the squark fields are parallel to the quark fields ( the super ckm basis ) , it is in general non - diagonal in flavour space .",
    "this quark - squark misalignment produces new fc terms in nc as well as in cc interactions . in the susy qcd sector , the fc interaction terms involve ncs of the gluino - quark - squark type . in the case of process  ( [ eq : sub ] ) , this gives rise to the additional feynman diagrams shown in the first row of fig .",
    "[ feynmannmfv ] . in the susy ew sector , the fc interaction terms involve ncs of the neutralino - quark - squark and the chargino - quark - squark type .",
    "the first type appears exclusively due to quark - squark misalignment , as in the susy - qcd case , whereas the second type receives contributions from both sources , quark - squark misalignment and ckm mixing .",
    "the additional feynman diagrams involving neutralino - quark - squark interactions are displayed in the second row of fig .",
    "[ feynmannmfv ] .    in order to simplify our analysis in the nmfv mssm",
    ", we take the ckm matrix to be diagonal , so that sm contributions ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ feynmansm ] ) and the genuine mfv - mssm contributions , i.e.  the charged - higgs - quark contributions and the part of the chargino - squark contributions due to ckm mixing ( cf .",
    "[ feynmanmfv ] ) , are zero .",
    "we are then left with the gluino - squark and neutralino - squark contributions ( cf .",
    "[ feynmannmfv ] ) and the residual chargino - squark contributions .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the non - ckm squark mixing is significant only for transitions between the second- and third - generation squarks , and that there is only left - left ( ll ) mixing , given by an ansatz similar as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is proportional to the product of the susy masses involved .",
    "this assumption is theoretically well motivated by the flavour - off - diagonal squark squared - mass entries that are radiatively induced via the evolution from high energies down to the ew scale according to the renormalisation group equations ( rges ) @xcite .",
    "these rges predict that the fc ll entries scale with the square of the soft - susy - breaking masses , in contrast with the left - right ( lr ) or right - left ( rl ) and the right - right ( rr ) entries , which scale with one or zero powers , respectively .",
    "thus , the hierarchy ll@xmath67lr , rl@xmath67rr is usually assumed . the same estimates also indicate that the ll entry for the mixing between the second- and third - generation squarks is the dominant one due to the larger quark - mass factors involved . on the other hand ,",
    "the lr and rl entries are experimentally more constrained , mainly by @xmath68 data  @xcite . with the previous assumption ,",
    "the squark squared - mass matrices in the @xmath69 and @xmath70 bases can be written as follows : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 and @xmath74 measure the squark flavour mixing strengths in the @xmath75@xmath76 and @xmath77@xmath78 sectors , respectively .",
    "as for the sm parameters , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are the mass , weak isospin , and electric charge of quark @xmath82 ; @xmath83 is the @xmath5-boson mass ; and @xmath84 is the sine of the weak mixing angle @xmath85 . as for the mssm parameters , @xmath86 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets ; @xmath87 is the higgs - higgsino mass parameter ; @xmath88 are the trilinear higgs - sfermion couplings ; and @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are the scalar masses .",
    "owing to su(2)@xmath92 invariance , we have @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "further mssm input parameters include the ew gaugino masses @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the gluino mass @xmath98 , and the mass @xmath99 of the cp - odd neutral higgs boson @xmath100 .    in order to reduce the nmfv - mssm parameter space , we make the following simplifying assumptions .",
    "we assume that the flavour mixing strengths in the @xmath75@xmath76 and @xmath77@xmath78 sectors coincide and put @xmath101 for a simpler notation .",
    "obviously , the choice @xmath102 represents the case of zero squark flavour mixing .",
    "we assume that the various trilinear higgs - sfermion couplings coincide and write @xmath103 .",
    "we assume that the scalar masses coincide thus defining the common susy mass scale @xmath104 . as for the gaugino masses , we impose the gut relation @xmath105 , where @xmath106 , while we treat the gluino mass parameter @xmath98 as independent .",
    "we are thus left with eight independent mssm parameters , namely , @xmath107 , @xmath99 , @xmath108 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath109 , @xmath87 , and @xmath110 .",
    "in this section , we present our numerical results .",
    "we adopt the sm parameters from ref .",
    "@xcite and the effective masses of the down - type quarks from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath111 here , @xmath43 and @xmath112 correspond to pole masses , while @xmath113 and @xmath114 were determined so that their insertion in the perturbative formula for the vacuum polarisation function of the photon reproduces the result extracted from the total cross section of hadron production in @xmath115 annihilation , measured as a function of the cm energy , using a subtracted dispersion relation .",
    "this set of quark masses is especially appropriate for quantitative studies in electroweak physics and is frequently employed in the literature .",
    "it is used here for definiteness and convenience . as a matter of principle ,",
    "the precise definition of quark mass is not yet fixed in an analysis of leading order ( lo ) in qcd like ours .",
    "in fact , the freedom of choice of quark - mass definition contributes to the theoretical uncertainty .",
