    "from a theoretical point of view , a quantum pump@xcite at zero temperature simply excites the fermi gas from the ground state into a non - equilibrium state . the exact many particle state obtained after a few pumping cycles depends on the applied time - dependent potential . when the external potential changes slowly ( this is commonly referred to as `` adiabaticity '' in the context of quantum pumps ) the final non - equilibrium state is completely determined by the evolution of the scattering matrix at the fermi energy @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it should be possible to obtain the distribution functions of various operators ( like total energy , total momentum , total charge in one of the leads , etc ) as functionals of @xmath0 .",
    "this turns out to be a non - trivial problem , which we address in the present paper .    historically , the first quantity studied in the above setting was the total energy absorbed by the fermi gas as a result of a sudden introduction of a single @xmath1-scatterer .",
    "the distribution function for absorbed energy shows a power - like divergence at low energies  the so called fermi edge singularity ( see e.g. ref .   for details ) .",
    "the distribution of the absorbed energy for a more general situation , when the strength of the @xmath1-wave scatterer changes arbitrarily in time , was considered in @xcite . in all these cases",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath0 commutes with itself at different times @xmath2 . the non - commutative case ,",
    "surprisingly , is much more difficult @xcite .",
    "the first non - perturbative treatment of the energy distribution for this case @xcite mapped the problem into a one - dimensional chiral determinant , and seemed not to be easily adapted for the computation of other quantities . in this paper",
    "we present an alternative approach which is much simpler and also readily applicable to distribution functions of * any * single particle operator .",
    "we illustrate our method using the distribution of the charge transmitted through a contact , which has attracted a lot of attention recently@xcite .",
    "the second moment of the charge distribution ( _ i.e. _  the shot noise power ) for a biased quantum point contact was considered theoretically by khlus @xcite and lesovik @xcite , and the full counting statistics was obtained by lesovik and levitov ( ll ) @xcite .",
    "the charge counting statistics for quantum pumps and quantum point contact under some specially chosen time - dependent bias were also considered  @xcite .",
    "the experimental measurements of the shot noise @xcite are now well established .",
    "the measurement of the higher cumulants , on the other hand , is still an unresolved problem actively discussed in the literature@xcite .",
    "the question of what can really be measured in an experiment , and the closely related question of the back influence of a detector onto the measured system are still widely discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "we use conceptually the simplest measurement scheme when the total charge @xmath3 in the left lead is measured twice .",
    "firstly before the pumping is started at time @xmath4 , and secondly after the pumping is finished at @xmath5 . at both times",
    "the leads are decoupled , so @xmath3 is a conserved quantity . the first measurement projects onto the state with a fixed number of electrons in the left lead .",
    "after that the pumping excites this state into a non - equilibrium state that is no longer an eigenstate of the charge operator .",
    "the statistics of the transmitted charge is given by the probability to find a particular number of electrons in the left lead during the second measurement .",
    "alternative approaches discussed in the literature include coupling the system to a spin and measuring the spin precession angle@xcite ; or measuring the statistics of the photon emission@xcite ; or measuring total dissipated energy@xcite .",
    "see also ref .   for a general framework for measuring the full counting statistics of a quantum mechanical variable .",
    "our main result is the closed expression for the full counting statistics in terms of the scattering matrix @xmath0 and the solution of an auxiliary matrix riemann - hilbert  ( rh ) problem .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 changes adiabatically , but otherwise do not restrict its time dependence . to demonstrate the power of the method we analyze in some detail the case of a biased quantum contact . in the limit of infinitely long pumping time",
    "the charge distribution is binomial@xcite .",
    "we compute the corrections to the binomial distribution when the pumping time is long but finite and discuss the physical meaning of these corrections .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ]",
    "we relate the counting statistics to a determinant of a certain operator ; in section  [ sec : rh ] we compute this determinant using a solution of a matrix rh problem ; in section  [ sec : contact ] we apply the general method to a biased quantum point contact and rederive ll s answer . in section  [ correction ]",
    "we asymptotically solve the relevant rh problem and obtain corrections to ll s answer due to finite measuring time .",
    "some technical results are relegated to the appendix .",
    "the free hamiltonian @xmath6 describes non - interacting fermi gas in two uncoupled leads .",
    "let the single particle states @xmath7 be the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath6 with energy @xmath8 , where @xmath9 labels energy degenerate states in both the left and the right lead . in the simplest case when the leads are one dimensional @xmath10 for the left lead and @xmath11 for the right lead .",
    "the annihilation operator in the state @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "we assemble @xmath14 such operators in the @xmath14-dimensional column @xmath15 @xmath16 and use the notation @xmath17 for the @xmath14-dimensional row of the creation operators .",
    "this gives for the free hamiltonian @xmath18 the time - dependent potential that couples the leads is described by an @xmath19 matrix @xmath20 , so the full hamiltonian has the form @xmath21 analogously , the total charge operator @xmath3 in the left lead is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the projector on the states in the left lead , and charge is measured in units of electron s charge . for two one - dimensional",
    "leads @xmath24      we want to compute the probability @xmath25 that the charge in the left lead changes by @xmath26 during the time @xmath27 .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 at zero bias the many particle ground state @xmath30 corresponds to filling the states below the fermi energy in both leads @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the true vacuum state with no electrons .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 takes some discrete values , so the total number of electrons is finite , and also set the fermi energy to zero . at zero temperature",
    "we have @xmath33 since the ground state  ( [ eq : ground ] ) is the eigenstate of the operator @xmath3 , the characteristic function @xmath34 can be written as @xmath35      to proceed , we separate the single - particle scattering problem from the computation of the expectation value over the ground state of the fermi - gas @xcite . since the hamiltonian @xmath36 is quadratic , we have @xmath37 where @xmath38 is some @xmath39 matrix that fully describes the * single particle * time - dependent scattering problem .",
    "we introduce the operator @xmath40 with matrix elements @xmath38 that acts on the full space of all possible states ( _ i.e. _  in both channel space and energy - space ) .",
    "this operator is unitary @xmath41 .",
    "we show that @xmath42 can be related to the scattering matrix @xmath43 on the instant value of the potential @xmath44 for electron with energy @xmath8 .    consider the scattering states with energy @xmath8 propagating towards the contact @xmath45 and out of it @xmath46 .",
    "let us label them and fix their phases in such a way that far from the contact @xmath47 , where @xmath12 is the eigenfunction for decoupled electrodes introduced previously . in the presence of the potential @xmath44 the eigen space corresponding to the energy @xmath8 is still @xmath14-times degenerate .",
    "far from the contact an eigen function has asymptotic form @xmath48 .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath49 relates the amplitudes of incoming and outgoing states @xmath50 .",
    "note , that the reflection coefficients are diagonal matrix elements of @xmath51 and our choice of phases for the scattering states ensures that for decoupled leads @xmath52 . for two one - dimensional leads @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the transmission amplitude and @xmath55 is the reflection amplitude for the electrons incident from the left .",
    "eq  ( [ eq : s2 ] ) implies that the scattering potential is real ( i.e. there is no magnetic field ) and uses this fact to relate the scattering amplitudes for the electrons coming from the right and from the left . for example , consider the two half - infinite one - dimensional conductors occupying left and right half - line and separated by an infinite potential wall of width @xmath56 .",
    "our choice of scattering states dictates @xmath57 and @xmath58 . when the conductors are connected and potential wall is completely removed we get @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the momentum of electrons with energy @xmath8 .",
    "the choice of the scattering states is not unique .",
    "another ( more common ) approach is to choose the scattering states in such a way that the scattering matrix for the fully opened channel is one .",
    "denoting the scattering matrix in this representation by @xmath62 we see that @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the scattering matrix for the fully open channel in the representation adopted in this paper .",
    "the adiabaticity condition ( common in describing `` quantum pumps '' ) means that @xmath65 changes slowly both as a function of time and energy @xmath66 using  ( [ eq : adiabatic ] ) one can show ( see e.g. [ ] ) that @xmath67 when @xmath42 acts on states near the fermi energy . here",
    "the operator @xmath68 is the fourier transform of the scattering matrix ,",
    "_ i.e. _  it has the matrix elements @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the density of states near the fermi energy per single channel . in the rest of the paper we often consider operators acting on both energy and channel indexes .",
    "for example , in addition to @xmath71 and @xmath68 introduced above we use the operator @xmath72 that has matrix elements @xmath73 .",
    "we use hats to distinguish these operators from the corresponding matrix - valued functions .",
    "the notation `` @xmath74 '' is used for trace in both channel and energy space , while the symbol `` @xmath75 '' is reserved to denote the trace in the @xmath39 channel space only .",
    "the remaining task is to compute the average with respect to the fermi ground state  ( [ eq : ground ] ) .",
    "we combine  ( [ eq : motion ] ) with ( [ eq : q ] ) and  ( [ eq : chi-1 ] ) and introduce the operator @xmath76 to obtain @xmath77 with matrix elements @xmath78 .",
    "in the block notation that separates the states with positive and negative energies we have @xmath79 in the same block notation the operator @xmath80 has the form @xmath81 since the ground state  ( [ eq : ground ] ) is simply a slater determinant we have @xmath82 for the first term in  ( [ eq : chi-1 ] ) .",
    "this expression is further simplified by noting that the operator @xmath83 has the same determinant as @xmath84 because in the block notation it takes the form @xmath85 the second term in  ( [ eq : chi-1 ] ) is simplified because @xmath30 is an eigenstate of the charge operator @xmath3 @xmath86 in this way we obtain @xmath87    eq .  ( [ eq : chi - c2 ] ) combined with  ( [ eq : hatr ] ) and  ( [ eq : sigma ] ) gives @xmath88 in the time representation @xmath68 and @xmath72 are multiplications by the matrix - valued functions @xmath0 and @xmath23 respectively and @xmath89 has matrix elements @xmath90 the representation of counting statistics for a biased quantum point contact through the determinant of type  ( [ eq : chi - c3 ] ) was obtained in ref .   and later adopted for parametric pumping@xcite and re - derived in different ways@xcite .",
    "our derivation is close in spirit to ref .",
    "@xcite and is probably the simplest .",
    "in addition it leads to a simple regularisation procedure which we discuss below .",
    "finally , we briefly mention that in the case when the left lead is biased with respect to the right lead by a time - dependent potential v(t ) , a gauge transformation can be performed on all states in the left electrode @xmath91 in the new gauge the ground state is again given by  ( [ eq : ground ] ) . the distribution function for this case",
    "can therefore be recovered from  ( [ eq : chi - c3 ] ) by substituting the gauge transformed scattering matrix @xmath92 instead of @xmath51 .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) is only valid for the states near the fermi surface .",
    "since the determinant in  ( [ eq : chi - c2 ] ) contains a non - vanishing contribution from the states deep below the fermi surface , the transition from ( [ eq : chi - c2 ] ) to  ( [ eq : chi - c3 ] ) is not quite correct .",
    "in particular , the determinant in  ( [ eq : chi - c3 ] ) is formally infinite ( and so requires regularisation ) while eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi - c2 ] ) gives a finite answer .",
    "to find out the correct regulator we use the decomposition @xmath93 in the first term in  ( [ eq : reg0 ] ) both the contributions from the states deep below the fermi surface ( when @xmath94 ) and the states high above the fermi surface ( where @xmath95 ) are zero , so eq .  ( [ eq : sigma ] ) can be used .",

    ", we identify @xmath99 with the average value of the total transmitted charge .    combining these results together we get @xmath100 where in the time representation @xmath80 is multiplication by the matrix valued function @xmath101 the first term in eq  ( [ eq : chi - c4 ] ) contains the information about the second and higher moments of the charge distribution .",
    "in this section we relate the operator trace @xmath102 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi - c4 ] ) to a solution of an auxiliary @xmath39 matrix riemann - hilbert problem .",
