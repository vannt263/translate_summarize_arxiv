    "recently a preliminary data on photon - hadron azimuthal correlation in nuclear collisions were also presented @xcite . in principle",
    ", such correlations should be easier for theoretical description as here only one jet enters , at least in leading order pqcd . on the experimental side ,",
    "such measurements are more difficult due to much reduced statistics as compared to the dijet studies .    up to now no theoretical calculation for photon - jet",
    "were presented in the literature , even for elementary collisions . in leading - order collinear - factorization approach the photon and the associated jet",
    "are produced back - to - back .",
    "if transverse momenta of partons entering the hard process are included , the transverse momenta of the photon and the jet are no longer balanced and finite ( non - zero ) correlations in a broad range of relative azimuthal angle and/or in lengths of transverse momenta of the photon and the jet are obtained .",
    "the finite correlations can be also obtained in higher - order collinear - factorization approach @xcite . according to our knowledge no detailed studies for present accelerators",
    "were presented in the literature .",

    "the @xmath0-factorization approach offers a relatively easy method to calculate the photon - jet correlations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-factorization approach was used recently to several high - energy reactions , including heavy quark pair photo- @xcite and hadroproduction @xcite , charmonium production @xcite , inclusive @xmath4 @xcite and higgs @xcite production .    in the present paper",
    "we shall compare results obtained in the leading - order k@xmath5-factorization approach and the next - to - leading order collinear - factorization approach .",
    "we shall discuss which approach is more adequate for the different regions of phase space .",
    "we shall present corresponding results for proton - proton scattering at rhic and proton - antiproton scattering at tevatron .",
    "it is known that at midrapidities and at relatively small transverse momenta the photon - jet production is dominated by ( sub)processes initiated by gluons . in fig.[fig:2to2_diagrams ] we show basic diagrams which appear in the @xmath0-factorization approach to photon - jet correlations .    in the @xmath0-factorization",
    "approach the cross section for a simultaneous production of a photon and an associated jet in the collisions of two hadrons ( @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are so - called unintegrated parton distributions .",
    "the longitudinal momentum fractions are evaluated as @xmath10 we shall return to the choice of the factorization scale in the next section .",
    "its role is completely different in different approaches i.e. different choices of updfs .",
    "a special attention will be devoted to the kwieciski updf and the role of the scale paramater .",
    "if one makes the following replacement @xmath11 then one recovers the standard leading - order collinear formula .",
    "the final partonic state is @xmath12 .",
    "the matrix elements for corresponding processes are discussed in appendix a.    the inclusive invariant cross section for direct photon production can be written as @xmath13 and analogously the cross section for the associated parton ( jet ) can be written as @xmath14 let us return to the coincidence cross section",
    ". the integration with the dirac delta function in eq.([photon_jet_cross_section ] ) @xmath15 can be performed by introducing the following new auxiliary variables : @xmath16 then our initial cross section can be written as : @xmath17 above @xmath18 .",
    "the factor @xmath19 before integrand on the rhs comes from the jacobian of the @xmath20 transformation ( see @xcite ) .      up to now we have concentrated only on processes with two explicit hard partons ( @xmath22 ) in the @xmath0-factorization approach .",
    "it is of interest to compare the results of our approach with those of the standard collinear next - to - leading order approach . in this section",
    "we discuss processes with three explicit hard partons . in fig.[fig : nlo_diagrams ] we show diagrams for @xmath21 subprocesses included in our calculations . in the following we assume particle no.1 to be a photon .",
    "then particle no.2 is @xmath23 and @xmath24 , depending on the subprocess .",
    "the cross section for @xmath25 processes can be calculated according to the standard parton model formula @xmath26 the elementary cross section can be written as @xmath27 where the three - body phase space element reads @xmath28 this element can be expressed in an equivalent way in terms of parton rapidities @xmath29 the last formula is useful for practical applications . now",
    "the cross section for hadronic collisions can be written in terms of @xmath21 matrix element as @xmath30 where the longitudinal momentum fractions are evaluated as @xmath31 repeating similar steps as for @xmath6 processes we get finally @xmath32 where the relative azimuthal angle between the photon and the associated jet ( @xmath33 ) is restricted to the interval @xmath34 .",
    "the last formula is very useful in calculating the cross section for particle 1 and particle 2 correlations .",
    "in this section we shall present results for rhic and tevatron energies .",
    "we use updfs from the literature .",
    "there are only two complete sets of updf in the literature which include not only the gluon distributions but also the distributions of quarks and antiquarks : + ( a ) kwieciski @xcite , + ( b ) kimber - martin - ryskin @xcite . + for comparison we shall include also the unintegrated parton distributions obtained from the collinear ones by the gaussian smearing procedure .",
    "such a procedure is often used in the context of direct photons @xcite . comparing results obtained with those gaussian distributions and the results obtained with the kwieciski distributions with nonperturbative gaussian form factors",
    "will allow to quantify the effect of updf evolution as contained in the kwieciski evolution equations .",
    "what is the hard scale for our process ? in our case the best candidate for the scale is the photon and/or jet transverse momentum .",
    "since we are interested in rather small transverse momenta the evolution length is not too large and the deviations from initial @xmath0-distributions ( assumed here to be gaussian ) should not be too big .    at high energies",
    "one enters into a small - x region , i.e. the region of a specific dynamics of the qcd emissions . in this region only unintegrated distributions of gluons exist in the literature . in our case",
    "the dominant contributions come from qcd - compton @xmath35 or @xmath36 initiated hard subprocesses .",
    "this means that we need unintegrated distributions of both gluons and quarks / antiquarks . in this case",
    "we take such ugdfs from the literature and supplement them by the gaussian distributions of quarks / antiquarks .",
    "let us start from presenting our results on the @xmath37 plane .",
    "in fig.[fig : updfs_ptpt ] we show the maps for different updfs used in the @xmath0-factorization approach as well as for nlo collinear - factorization approach for @xmath38  gev and at the tevatron energy @xmath39  gev . in the case of the kwieciski distribution we have taken @xmath40 = 1 gev@xmath41 for the exponential nonperturbative form factor and the scale parameter @xmath42 = 100 gev@xmath43 .",
    "rather similar distributions are obtained for different updfs .",
    "the distribution obtained in the nlo approach differs qualitatively from those obtained in the @xmath0-factorization approach .",
    "first of all , one can see a sharp ridge along the diagonal @xmath44 .",
    "this ridge corresponds to a soft singularity when the unobserved parton has very small transverse momentum @xmath45 .",
    "as will be clear in a moment this corresponds to the azimuthal angle between the photon and the jet being @xmath46 .",
    "obviously this is a region which can not be reliably calculated in collinear pqcd .",
    "there are different practical possibilities to exclude this region from the calculations . the most primitive way ( possible only in theoretical calculations ) is to impose a lower cut on transverse momentum of the unobserved parton @xmath45 .",
    "secondly , the standard collinear nlo approach generates much bigger cross section at configurations asymmetric in @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we shall return to this observation in the course of this paper .    as discussed in ref.@xcite",
    "the kwieciski distributions are very useful to treat both the nonperturbative ( intrinsic nonperturbative transverse momenta ) and the perturbative ( qcd broadening due to parton emission ) effects on the same footing . in fig.[fig : kwiecinski_scale ] we show the effect of the scale evolution of the kwieciski updfs on the azimuthal angle correlations between the photon and the associated jet .",
    "we show results for different initial conditions ( @xmath40 = 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 gev@xmath41 ) . at the initial scale ( fixed here as in the original grv @xcite to be @xmath42 = 0.25 gev@xmath43 )",
    "there is a sizeable difference of the results for different @xmath40 .",
    "the difference becomes less and less pronounced when the scale increases . at @xmath42 = 100 gev@xmath43",
    "the differences practically disappear .",
    "this is due to the fact that the qcd - evolution broadening of the initial parton transverse momentum distribution is much bigger than the typical initial nonperturbative transverse momentum scale .    in fig.[fig :",

    "is made over transverse momenta @xmath38  gev and rapidities @xmath49 .",

    "[ fig : updfs_phid ] , height=226 ]    the singularity in nlo pqcd at @xmath46 is strongly correlated with the sharp ridge in fig.[fig : updfs_ptpt ] d. this is demonstrated in fig.[fig : nlo_p3t_cut ] where we present the results of azimuthal correlation function obtained for different cuts on @xmath45 .",
    "the cut modifies only the region of relative azimuthal angles close to @xmath51 .",
    "we wish to stress in this context that there are no singularities of the ridge type in the @xmath0-factorization approach .     for proton - antiproton collision at w = 1960 gev for the nlo collinear - factorization approach and different cuts on @xmath45 . here",
    "[ fig : nlo_p3t_cut ] , height=226 ]    the small transverse momenta of the unobserved jet contribute to the sharp ridge along the diagonal @xmath44 .",
    "it is therefore difficult to distinguish these three - parton states from the states with two partons .",
    "the ridge can be eliminated in calculation by imposing a cut on the transverse momentum of the third ( unobserved ) parton . in experiments",
    "there is no possibility to impose such cuts and other methods must be used .",
    "we shall return to this point later in this paper . in fig.[fig : leading_jets_angle ] we show angular azimuthal correlations for different relations between transverse momenta of outgoing photon and partons : ( a ) with no constraints on @xmath45 , ( b ) the case where @xmath52 condition ( called leading jet condition in the following ) is imposed , ( c ) @xmath53 and an additional condition @xmath54 .",

    "that the associated jet is the leading jet @xmath58 causes that the large part of the phase space @xmath59 is not available in the next - to - leading approach .",
    "if one imposes in addition that @xmath47(photon ) @xmath60 @xmath45(unobserved jet ) then also the @xmath61 region becomes excluded for the nlo approach .",
    "these nlo - excluded regions are therefore regions sensitive to higher - order corrections in pqcd .",
    "in general , the correlations between the photon and the jet depend strongly on all kinematical variables - transverse momenta , azimuthal angles , etc . in order to expose this better , in fig.[fig : ptpt_planes ] we define windows in the @xmath62 plane which will be used in the following to study the azimuthal correlations . at lower energies ( as for rhic ) a region of rather low transverse momenta is more adequate ( left figure ) . at larger energies ( as for tevatron ) also region of somewhat larger transverse momenta can be of interest ( right figure ) .",
