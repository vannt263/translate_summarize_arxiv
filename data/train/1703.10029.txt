    "the evolution of @xmath1 through the fokker - planck equation , the second equation in ( [ eq : cbf mfg ] ) , also depends on @xmath27 .",
    "mfgs , introduced in @xcite , were investigated extensively in the last few years .",

    "for example , the parabolic problem was considered for strong solutions in @xcite and weak solutions in @xcite .",

    "classical and weak solution were sought in @xcite . in both standard and stationary problems , the uniqueness of solution",
    "is guaranteed by monotonicity of the coupling @xmath28 .",
    "the congestion problem was first addressed in @xcite and later , other approaches such as density constraints and nonlinear mobilities were used in @xcite .",

    "these riemann invariants give lower bounds for the density , @xmath1 , and , for parabolic mfgs , these bounds combined with an entropy estimate gives the existence of a classical global solution ( theorem [ mteo ] ) .",
