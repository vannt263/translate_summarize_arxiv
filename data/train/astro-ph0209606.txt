    "the so - called cold dark matter crisis has led to a vast number of publications trying to solve the problems which seem to be associated with an excess of power on small scales .",
    "one possibility to reduce this power is to introduce warm dark matter ( i.e. knebe  2002 ; bode , ostriker  & turok 2001 ; avila - reese  2001 ; colin  2000 ) . but",
    "another way to decrease power on a certain scale is to introduce a negative feature ( `` dip '' ) into an otherwise unperturbed cdm power spectrum ( cf .",
    "knebe  2001 ) .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed that could generate such features in the primordial spectrum during the epoch of inflation . among these",
    "are models with broken scale invariance ( bsi ) ( lesgourgues , polarski  & starobinsky 1998 ) , and particularly bsi due to phase transitions during inflation ( barriga  2000 ) .    the  and the fiducial  model used in this paper are the same as those presented in knebe  ( 2002 ) with the cosmological parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6kev for . for the dip model we are using the same prescription to introduce a gaussian feature into an otherwise unperturbed cdm power spectrum as outlined in knebe , islam  & silk ( 2001 ) with the parameters @xmath7=-0.995 , @xmath8=0.5 , and @xmath9=1.8",

    "in fig .  [ power ]",
    "we show the evolution of the dark matter power spectrum . we clearly see that the features are well represented in the initial conditions .",
    "but it is important to note that the non - linear transfer of power from large to small scales has washed out these features completely by redshift @xmath10=0 .",
    "therefore it is impossible to use current observations of the ( galaxy ) power spectrum as for instance measured by the 2df team ( percival  2001 ) to set constraints on features on such small scales ( e.g. 1.8 ) in the primordial power spectrum .",
    ".number of satellite galaxies within the virial radius of the most massive halo . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one of the major problems with cold dark matter is the over - prediction of satellite galaxies orbiting within a galactic halo ( klypin 1999 , moore 1999 ) . in table  [ satellites ] we summarize the number of satellites found in the most massive dark matter halo .",
    "it indicates that both non - standard models are able to overcome that problem .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ masshistory ] shows that the mass history of that halo is indistinguishable for all three models and hence the differences for @xmath11 ( along with the agreement for @xmath12 ) in table  [ satellites ] can now only be explained by a different ratio of satellite accretion to satellite destruction throughout the models ; in our non - standard models satellite galaxies are more easily disrupted because they are less concentrated .",
    "another interesting outcome is the formation history as well as the formation sites of low - mass galaxies @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "[ abundance ] demonstrates that such halos do form at later times compared to the standard  model and a detailed analysis of their formation sites shows that they are preferably forming along the filaments .",
    "we conclude from the given analysis that both our non - standard models work equally well even though they are based on completely different physical processes ; where wdm requires the introduction of a new particle species the dip model is based on a non - standard inflationary period .",
    "the only way of breaking their degeneracy might lie within the filamentary structures of the universe and the low - mass end of the mass function .",
    "but to strengthen these findings we need more detailed and much better resolved simulations in the future .",
    "the simulations were run at the centre for astrophysics  & supercomputing , swinburne university and the oxford supercomputer centre .",
    "we are grateful to a. klypin and a. kravtsov for kindly providing a copy of the art code that was used for the  and  simulation , respectively ."
