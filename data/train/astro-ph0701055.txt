    "the identification of large numbers of early - to - mid m dwarfs has enabled studies focused on their activity and kinematics @xcite and recent work has extended these investigations to late - m and early - l dwarfs @xcite but faint magnitudes and small numbers have prevented a thorough study of the activity and kinematics of l dwarfs . in order to fill that gap , we analyze a sample of ultracool dwarfs ( spectral types m7l8 ) photometrically selected from the the two micron all sky survey @xcite . the two micron proper motion sample ( 2mupm sample )",

    "the fraction of active objects increases with later spectral type while the strength of h@xmath3 emission remains relatively constant , though with scatter @xcite . for m7 to late - l dwarfs , h@xmath3 emission becomes increasingly less common with later spectral type as the activity strength decreases @xcite .",

    "it was not possible to measure complete uvw kinematics for the 2mupm sample .",
    "the spectra were not obtained with the goal of measuring radial velocities ; they are from a variety of telescopes and conditions .",
    "radial velocities require more consistent data .",
    "additionally , the spectra for fainter dwarfs do not have sufficient signal - to - noise to measure radial velocities so the sample would be incomplete in later spectral types . while the lack of complete space motions does effect our analysis of individual objects",
    ", it should not drastically effect the kinematics of the population @xcite .",
    "proper motions were previously published for 95 of the 152 objects in the 2mupm sample .",
    "we compared these measurements with ours to perform a check on our method of measuring proper motions . for 44 objects",
    ", measurements were made by either astrometric studies @xcite or kinematic studies @xcite .",
    "additionally , 80 of the 152 objects , proper motions were published in the usno - b astrometric catalog @xcite .",

    "the usno - b measurements are not completely consistent with ours .",
    "seventy of 80 objects agree within 0.1  yr@xmath14 . of the remaining 10 , five agree within 0.2  yr@xmath14 , and five did not agree ( within @xmath100.2  yr@xmath14 ; these are not included in figure  [ fig : pm ] ) .",
    "the automated methods used to measure proper motions for the usno - b catalog are prone to mismatches ; we prefer our proper motions as each measurement has been verified by eye",
    ".    comparison with other works shows good agreement ; our measurements are within 0.1  yr@xmath14 of previous @xmath16 and 10  of previously measured position angle .",
    "the one exception is sips 1936@xmath75502 , which we measure at @xmath17 , pa=131  ( with a three year baseline ) and @xcite measure at @xmath18 , pa=134 .",
    "it is possible that our measurement is not entirely correct due to the short baseline , but we retain the object in our sample as it would be included in the absence of a comparison measurement .",
    "generally , the proper motions found by parallax studies are more accurate , but we use our own measurements for consistency .",
    "twenty - one of the 60 objects analyzed by @xcite were re - observed as part of the 2mupm sample .",
    "the proper motions show agreement within 0.06  yr@xmath14 ( within our uncertainties ) but the v@xmath5 comparison is less consistent .",
    "the distance estimates in @xcite are based on @xmath19 color while our distances are derived from a spectral type / m@xmath11 relation .",
    "the latter method yields improved distances ( accurate to @xmath610% ) and thus more precise kinematics .",
    "for example , the maximum v@xmath5 of 141  km  s@xmath14 in @xcite was reduced to 97.9  km  s@xmath14 due to the revised distance estimate .",
    "an optical spectrum ( 600010000 ) for almost every object in the 2mupm sample was obtained in order to assign spectral types ( papers v , ix , and x ) .",
    "most ( 132 ) spectra examined for this analysis were obtained for the classification of the 2mass selected samples , but some spectra from other sources were used .",
    "spectral references are given in table  [ tab : ha ] .",
    "of the 152 2mupm objects , there were 150 optical spectra available .",
    "two dwarfs , 2mass  j01550354 + 0950003 and 2mass  j14283132 + 5923354 were confirmed and spectral typed using infrared spectra and we have not yet obtained optical spectra .    the _ splot _ routine in iraf was used to visually inspect each spectrum and measure h@xmath3 equivalent width ( ew ) and line flux .",
    "h@xmath3 emission was detected in 63 of 81 m dwarfs and 15 of 69 l dwarfs , and upper limits were placed on h@xmath3 non - detections by measuring the ew of a representative noise spike . because emission strength for mid- to late - l dwarfs can be as small as 1 - 2 , we consider objects with h@xmath3 emission distinguishable from noise as active rather than establishing a cut - off between active and inactive .",
    "we combined h@xmath3 line flux with bolometric flux to obtain @xmath4 .",
    "bolometric fluxes were calculated for each object using 2mass @xmath20 magnitudes and the bolometric correction ( bc@xmath21 ) for @xmath20 magnitudes found by @xcite .",
    "bc@xmath21 is calculated from the polynomial fit to a spectral type / bolometric magnitude relation . for two objects",
    ", we were able to obtain h@xmath3 ew but not line flux because the spectra were not flux calibrated .",
    "h@xmath3 measurements and upper limits are presented in table  [ tab : ha ] , and the activity properties of the 2mupm sample are discussed in detail in   [ sec : actresults ] .    for binary objects unresolved in 2mass , the bolometric flux is calculated from the combined magnitude .",
    "this presents a problem when measuring h@xmath3 emission from the combined spectra because we do not know what fraction of the total activity is emitted by which component .",
    "if one dwarf is active and the other inactive , the ratio of measured h@xmath3 flux to the combined bolometric flux results in a smaller relative emission strength than would be calculated for the single active dwarf . because we use the log of a ratio to indicate h@xmath3 strength , the resulting uncertainty depends on the relative contributions of each component to the bolometric flux , which in turn depends on @xmath22 ( the difference of the magnitudes ) .",
    "if both components have equal emission strengths and @xmath20 magnitudes , then the measured @xmath4 will be correct . for an equal mass binary with one active and one inactive component , @xmath4 is 0.30 dex lower than it would be for the single active object .",
    "the effect will be smaller for an unequal mass binary ; for @xmath23 and activity only from the more luminous object , our calculated @xmath4 is 0.08 dex lower than it would be for the single active object . in figures  [ fig : sthalpha ] and",
    "[ fig : vtanh ] , binaries are plotted as shaded symbols with the maximum uncertainties resulting from the combined magnitudes ( + 0.30 dex ) . the lhs1070 system has resolved spectroscopy and there is no uncertainty as to which component is producing h@xmath3 emission .",
    "we used relative photometry from @xcite to determine the bolometric flux of the b and c components , and measured h@xmath3 from resolved spectroscopy ( leinert , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "the wavelength range of our optical spectra enabled examination of the 2mupm sample for the absorption line . according to the `` lithium test",
    ", '' the detection of the absorption feature is a sufficient , but not necessary , indicator of substellar mass @xcite .",
    "we have detected in 3 of the 69 l dwarfs in the 2mupm sample , which is a significantly smaller fraction than the one third found in the @xcite sample of 25 l dwarfs .",
    "this disparity is likely due to the lower signal - to - noise ratio of our spectra ( obtained mostly with 4-m telescopes ) , compared to the @xcite keck 10-m spectra , so the small number of detections is likely an observational effect rather than a physical property .",
    "individual objects with detections are discussed in papers v , ix , and x but there are not sufficient detections to use as an age diagnostic in the 2mupm sample .    for the objects that overlap with the @xcite sample , comparison of our h@xmath3 ew measurements yields some interesting differences . of 21 objects , 15 had comparable ( within 3   ) h@xmath3 ew measurements .",
    "three of the six dwarfs with significantly different measurements have been observed in flare and are discussed in   [",
    "sec : flareobjects ] .",
    "the other three objects have differences of 615   .",
    "it is likely that these differences are evidence of variability rather than the result of different signal - to - noise or measuring techniques .",
    "measurements for these three objects which show smaller variations are listed with those of objects showing stronger variability in table  [ tab : flare ] . for objects observed in both flare and quiescence ,",
    "the quiescent measurement is used for sample statistics .",

    "[ sec : actresults ] and variable activity in   [ sec : flareobjects ] .",
    "the photometric selection of the 2mupm sample provides an opportunity to study kinematics without bias and derive age estimates from a well - defined sample .",
    "the 2mupm sample is characterized by a mean tangential velocity of @xmath24 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath25 .",
    "there are two outliers ( v@xmath26 ) excluded from the kinematic analysis ; these fast moving dwarfs are discussed in   [ sec : fastobjects ] . the mean velocity and velocity dispersion show good agreement with the kinematics of the @xcite sample . to obtain a kinematic age estimate for the 2mupm sample",
    ", we use @xmath27 to estimate the total velocity dispersion ( @xmath28 ) with the equation @xmath29 .",
    "velocity dispersion is converted to age using the relation found by @xcite @xmath30^{1/3}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is mean population age in years . with @xmath33 ( which excludes the outliers discussed in   [ sec : fastobjects ] ) , this relation yields an age estimate of 3.1 gyr for the 2mupm sample .",
    "this kinematic age is sensitive to the spectrophotometric distances used to calculate v@xmath5 .",
    "allowing for the possibility of a systematic 10% over- or underestimation of the distances , we calculate that age estimates could vary from 2.24.2  gyr .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the kinematic age estimate of 24  gyr found by @xcite .",
    "we can use kinematics to further investigate the age distribution of m and l dwarfs .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the substellar mass function by @xcite produce a modeled age distribution with respect to t@xmath34 , shown in his figure 8 .",
    "though there is a large spread of ages in each spectral type / temperature bin , the general trend shows an older mean age for late - m and early - l dwarfs and a younger mean age for late - l dwarfs .",
    "this is because the l spectral class encompasses a combination of stellar and substellar objects .",
    "only younger , relatively warm brown dwarfs have t@xmath34 that corresponds to l spectral types .",
    "stars can have spectral types as late as @xmath6l4 and are likely to be older than brown dwarfs with the same t@xmath34 @xcite .",
    "one might expect that the combination of both younger brown dwarfs and older stars in late - m to early - l types would produce a wider velocity distribution while late - l types contain exclusively brown dwarfs and would have a narrower distribution .    to compare the expected ages with the kinematic distribution of the 2mupm sample , we plot v@xmath5 as a function of spectral type ( figure  [ fig : stvtan ] ) .",
    "we also plot the mean velocity and standard deviation for each spectral type bin to aid kinematic interpretation .",
    "across m7 to l8 spectral types , the mean velocities per spectral type are largely constant .",
    "they are scattered within a range of @xmath35 to @xmath36 , but there is no recognizable trend that hints at the expected age distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : vsthisto ] shows velocity distribution histograms of the m7l2 and l3l8 populations .",
    "both distributions peak at the bin centered on 25  @xmath37 , and the velocity dispersions of the populations are nearly equal ( m7l2 with @xmath33 and l3l8 with @xmath38 ) , implying no age difference .",
    "it is possible that the 2mupm sample is too small for kinematics to distinguish between stars and brown dwarfs , but it is also likely that the age effect is not pronounced enough to be apparent in kinematics .      the three fastest objects in the 2mupm sample warrant additional discussion .",
    "the fastest dwarf is ( hereafter 2m1721 + 33 ) , an l3 with a velocity of @xmath39 ; the next fastest is ( hereafter 2m0251@xmath703 ) , an l3 with a velocity of @xmath40 ; and third fastest is ( hereafter 2m1300 + 19 ) , an l1 dwarf with a velocity of @xmath41 .",
    "both 2m0251@xmath703 and 2m1721 + 33 are 4@xmath42 faster than the mean and are excluded from our kinematic analysis . while 2m1300 + 19 also has a high velocity ,",
    "it is not as unusual as the two kinematic outliers and is included in our kinematic analysis .",
    "in addition to their fast velocities , 2m1300 + 19 and 2m1721 + 33 are also unusually blue for their spectral types .",
    "bluer colors suggest low metallicity and old dwarfs are likely to have high velocities .",
    "@xcite discussed 2m1300 + 19 because the combination of its unusually blue color and high velocity indicate that it is likely to be old .",
    "our calculated @xmath43 is the third fastest velocity in the 2mupm sample .",
    "both 2m1200 + 19 and 2m1721 + 33 are discussed and spectra are presented in papers v and ix because the combination of their slightly blue colors and faster kinematics suggest thick disk membership .",
    "the remaining outlier , 2m0251@xmath703 , is also on the blue end of the color distribution but does not have unusual colors like 2m1300 + 19 and 2m1721 + 33 .",

    "tangential velocity is only two of the three components of the total velocity , and a slow radial velocity would place 2m0251@xmath703 closer to the mean of the kinematic distribution . while 2m0251@xmath703 may be an unusual object ,",
    "it is likely that its high velocity is simply the tail of the disk kinematic distribution .",

    "the activity fraction declines with later spectral type , but it does not go to zero .",
    "h@xmath3 emission is present in 4 of 50 dwarfs between spectral types l2 and l8 .",
    "we find that the activity fraction of the 2mupm sample drops rapidly through l dwarf sub - types .",
    "half of l0 dwarfs are active , one - fifth to two - fifths of l1 dwarfs , and approximately one - tenth for spectral types l2 and later . while there is no doubt that the activity fraction drops , it is possible that the steepness of the drop is due to small numbers and observational effects rather than the activity properties of l dwarfs . for spectral types",
    "l3 and later , h@xmath3 was only detected in spectra taken with 8-m or 10-m telescopes .",
    "the ew of those detections is smaller than the upper limit of most spectra taken with smaller telescopes .",
    "@xcite suggest that a lowered continuum surrounding the h@xmath3 emission feature should make up for the decreased sensitivity , but to fully investigate the activity properties of late - l dwarfs , higher signal - to - noise spectra are needed .",

    "@xcite ( figure  1 ) found that 73% of m8 dwarfs in their sample show h@xmath3 emission and the activity fraction similarly declines with later spectral type .",
    "they investigate the possibility that their maximum activity fraction is lower ( 73% rather than 100% ) due to the galactic distribution of their sample .",
    "the @xcite sample , photometrically selected from sdss with distances as large as 200  pc , includes a kinematically older portion of dwarfs due to its larger mean scale height above the galactic disk .",
    "the distance limits of the 2mupm sample and the @xcite sample ( 20  pc and 25  pc ) exclude dwarfs with large scale heights and thus include a younger population .    though ew is a standard way to characterize emission and absorption features , it is not an accurate measure of activity strength across all ultracool spectral types .",
    "the continuum flux surrounding the h@xmath3 feature decreases with later spectral type for m and l dwarfs , so the ratio of h@xmath3 line flux to bolometric flux is used instead of ew to compare the strength of h@xmath3 emission across a wide range of spectral types @xcite .",

    "m dwarfs become fully convective at spectral type @xmath6m3 , and activity in later - type stars is attributed to a turbulent dynamo @xcite .",
    "however , the chromospheric activity distribution gives no indication of this transition : the average level of activity for m1 to m5 dwarfs with detected h - alpha remains constant at @xmath50 @xcite . at spectral types beyond m6 ,",

    "solar - type main sequence stars exhibit a direct correlation between age and activity ; this is generally attributed to rotational spin - down , and a consequent reduction in the energy output of the rotational dynamo . as noted in the previous section , mid- and late - type m dwarfs",
    "are fully convective , and are therefore not expected to show the same dependence between activity and rotation . indeed , there is observational evidence that these late - type dwarfs exhibit different age - activity relationships @xcite . for the 2mupm sample , we find that there is a large scatter in the plot of h@xmath3 emission strength ( @xmath4 ) as a function of v@xmath5 ( figure  [ fig : vtanh ] ) .",
    "velocity is not a precise age indicator , but a loose correlation would be expected if ultracool dwarfs followed a solar - type activity - age relation .",

    "the active dwarfs have a smaller velocity dispersion ( @xmath53 ) and a slightly slower peak ( @xmath54 ) than the inactive dwarfs ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) which implies that the active dwarfs are younger than the inactive dwarfs .",

    "further investigation indicates that this activity lifetime is longer with later spectral type ( west et al .",

    "if this describes activity in the 2mupm sample , then our population is too young ( 24 gyr ) to show the effect of age on activity .    to examine the kinematics in more detail",

    "the active and inactive l dwarfs in the 2mupm sample are kinematically indistinguishable , which is not surprising considering the small numbers of active l dwarfs .",
    "a larger sample would likely provide more insight into the age distribution of active l dwarfs .",
    "out of the 150 objects in the 2mupm sample with optical spectra , there are 11 dwarfs that exhibit evidence of variability .",
    "four of these have two observations with only 515    differences between the h@xmath3 ew measurements . while their h@xmath3 fluxes are not strong enough to classify them as flares , it is possible that this smaller scale variability is evidence that they are flaring objects not yet caught in peak flux .",
    "both lhs 2065 and lp 412 - 31 have small scale variability as well as observed flare events .",
    "it is also possible that many more ultracool dwarfs have small scale variability but the effect has not yet been observed .",
    "seven dwarfs ( 5 m and 2 l ) in the 2mupm sample have been observed during flare events .",

    "it is difficult to compare the strength of the 2m1028@xmath714 flare with the most active m dwarfs since the emphasis of previous studies has been on the ultraviolet and blue spectra plus h@xmath3 . in these flare events , the erupting plasma reaches temperatures of order 10@xmath66  k and forms a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum peaking in the far - ultraviolet @xcite .",
    "coordinated studies in the far - ultraviolet used the international ultraviolet explorer satellite with ground - based telescopes to measure this continuum component in the far - ultraviolet for flares in yz cmi , proxima cen , and ad leo @xcite .",
    "one of the most impressive of these coordinated studies was that of @xcite on `` great flare of 1985 april 12 on ad leonis . ''",
    "these studies , however , provide no red optical spectra for direct comparison to 2m1028@xmath714 .",
    "@xcite argued that , if the ultraviolet flux scaled with h@xmath3 in the same manner as it does in the m flare stars studied from space , 2m0149 + 29 emitted a flare luminosity that exceeded the normal bolometric photospheric luminosity at the flare s peak .",
    "the same argument would apply to 2m1028@xmath714 , but the greater relative strength of the red continuum flux suggests that the flare s peak luminosity could have exceeded that of the quiet photosphere even more than in the 2m0149 + 29 flare event .",
    "we do not know whether the strongest m flare stars have red continua that turn blue like the 2m1028@xmath714 event because we are not aware of an observation where a flare continuum was studied at these wavelengths .",
    "more observations of these known flare stars in the optical would provide direct comparison , as would ultraviolet observations of 2m1028@xmath714 in flare .",

    "<S> we calculate tangential velocities . </S>",
    "<S> the sample has a mean tangential velocity of @xmath0 , a velocity dispersion of @xmath1 , and a maximum tangential velocity of v@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these kinematic results are in excellent agreement with previous studies of ultracool dwarfs in the local solar neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> h@xmath3 emission , an indicator of chromospheric activity , was detected in 63 of 81 late - m dwarfs and 16 of 69 l dwarfs examined . </S>",
    "<S> we find a lack of correlation between activity strength , measured by @xmath4 , and v@xmath5 , though velocity distributions suggest that the active dwarfs in our sample are slightly younger than the inactive dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with previous studies of activity in ultracool dwarfs , we find that the fraction of h@xmath3 emitting objects per spectral type peaks at spectral type m7 and declines through mid - l dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> activity strength is similarly correlated with spectral type for spectral types later than m7 . </S>",
    "<S> eleven dwarfs out of 150 show evidence of variability , ranging from small fluctuations to large flare events . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate a flare cycle of @xmath65% for late - m dwarfs and @xmath62% for l dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> observations of strong , variable activity on the l1 dwarf 2mass  j10224821 + 5825453 and an amazing flare event on the the m7 dwarf 2mass  j1028404@xmath7143843 are discussed . </S>"
