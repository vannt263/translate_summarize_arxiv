    "[ fig : leveldiagram ] , the mot remains functional because decay of excited atoms into metastable intermediate states does not necessarily result in the loss of those atoms . on the contrary , a large fraction of these metastable , dark - state atoms remain magnetically trapped and eventually relax back to the ground state .",

    "this difference arises because doppler mechanisms rely on absorption and spontaneous emission , so zeeman shifts of both the ground and excited states affect the cooling efficiency ; on the other hand , sub - doppler mechanisms rely on stimulated processes between ground state sub - levels , and thus depend primarily on zeeman shifts in the ground state . because the land @xmath0 factors of the ground and excited states of a cooling transition are generally unequal , there is a critical magnetic field value at which the two mechanisms  unlock , \" with the larger capture range of the doppler cooling force dominating beyond this point @xcite . for most laser - cooled atoms ,",
