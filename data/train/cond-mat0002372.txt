    "what is there to be explained about supercooled liquids and the glass transition ?",
    "the lack of agreement over the answer to this question certainly contributes to the multiplicity of proposed models and theories , many of which seem orthogonal to each other . our own starting point ,",
    "further motivated and discussed in this article , is that the most distinctive feature of supercooled liquids , in particular of the so - called `` fragile '' liquids on which we focus , is the stupendous continuous increase of viscosity ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath0-relaxation time ( @xmath2 ) with decreasing temperature ( some 15 order - of - magnitude increase over the range over which the substance is liquid , i. e. , a factor - of - two change in temperature ) , an increase that is characterized for most liquids ( with the possible exception of strong network - forming systems ) by a crossover at a temperature @xmath3 from a roughly arrhenius temperature dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath4 for @xmath5 to a faster - than- arrhenius , or superarrhenius dependence for @xmath6 .",
    "the viscous slowing down appears to be best described as a thermally activated process , whose evolution is primarily controlled by temperature and not by volume or density ( at least at low pressure ) .",
    "it is of particular interest that the effective activation free energy for viscous flow and @xmath0 relaxation in _ weakly - bonded systems _",
    ", such as the much studied ortho - terphenyl , when measured relative to the energy characteristic of thermal fluctuations @xmath7 , varies by a factor of @xmath8 or @xmath9 between the melting point @xmath10 and the glass `` transition '' temperature @xmath11 at which it reaches the high value of about @xmath12 , a value that is comparable to that of strongly - bonded systems such as silica glasses .",
    "concomitant to these variations and adding to the puzzle is the absence of associated singular behavior or strong signature in the structural data@xcite .",
    "whereas mounting evidence has been recently provided that shows the slow dynamics in deeply supercooled liquids to be heterogeneous , with spatial heterogeneities ( containing of the order of @xmath13 molecules around @xmath11 ) being largely responsible for the nonexponential character of the @xmath0 relaxation and for the decoupling of translational diffusion time scales from viscosity and rotational relaxation times,@xcite direct diffraction data do not seem to reflect the existence of supermolecular structural correlations .",
    "these are the phenomena that we find particularly intriguing about the glass transition , and our viewpoint is that models , theories , and computer simulations should be ultimately evaluated in terms of their ability to explain and describe these main features .    in the following , we first present some experimental evidence supporting the description of the viscous slowing down of glass - forming liquids as a temperature- controlled activated process crossing over to superarrhenius @xmath14-dependence in the supercooled regime .",
    "the emphasis is placed on weakly - bonded , `` fragile '' liquids . in the light of these observations ,",
    "the relevance of simple atomistic models used in most computer simulations is addressed next .",
    "finally , we summarize our theoretical approach of supercooled liquids based on frustration - limited domains and discuss its main ingredients and predictions .",
    "the dramatic increase of viscosity and @xmath0-relaxation time with decreasing temperature in supercooled liquids calls for a logarithmic representation that is traditionally displayed in an arrhenius type of diagram , with @xmath15 or @xmath16 as a function of @xmath17 , or as advocated by angell@xcite as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "as is already well known and is illustrated in fig.1a , systems forming a network of strong intermolecular bonds such as @xmath19 are characterized by a rather linear variation in @xmath17 , i. e. , by an arrhenius temperature dependence , while the other liquids show a marked upward curvature which represents a faster - than - arrhenius , or superarrhenius , temperature dependence .",
    "this latter feature is particularly noticeable for weakly - bonded , `` fragile '' liquids , such as ortho - terphenyl@xcite .",
    "a different way of presenting the phenomenon is to plot the effective activation free energy for a relaxation and viscosity , e(t ) , specified by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath22 is a high-@xmath14 relaxation time taken as independent of temperature ( a similar equation holds for the viscosity ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "1b , where the temperature is scaled for each liquid to a temperature @xmath3 above which the dependence is roughly arrhenius - like , i. e. , @xmath23 is , to a good approximation , constant .",
    "the determination of @xmath3 is subject to some uncertainty,@xcite but the procedure stresses the crossover from arrhenius - like to superarrhenius behavior that is typical of most glassforming liquids .",
    "a first observation is that @xmath24 is large compared to @xmath25 ( it is about @xmath12 at @xmath11 ) , which strongly suggests that the @xmath0 relaxation and the viscous flow in supercooled liquids are best described as thermally activated processes .",
    "the paradigm for an activated process is that of a chemical reaction where the activation barrier , typically more than @xmath26 , is reasonably independent of temperature ( indicating an arrhenius behavior ) and a reaction path involving a small set of coordinates may be well identified",
    ". relaxation in strong network - forming systems , in which molecular transport requires that enough thermal energy be provided to break the strong intermolecular bonds , might be expected to fit this simple picture .",
    "however , the activated relaxation found in weakly - bonded , fragile liquids is astonishing both because the effective activation free energy increases markedly as the temperature is lowered towards @xmath11 ( a factor of @xmath27 , or in units of @xmath7 a factor of @xmath9 , in the case of ortho - terphenyl ) and because it reaches values that are much bigger than the typical energy associated with the intermolecular bonding .",
    "what are then the source and the explanation of this superarrhenius activated behavior ? they can not be described by conventional transition - state theories used in the context of chemical reactions nor by standard theories of critical slowing down in the vicinity of a usual second - order phase transition . in connection with this last statement",
    "we note that the slowing down of dynamics when approaching a critical point ( here , a hypothetical singular temperature below @xmath11 as predicted for instance by the vogel - fulcher - tammann formula ) is usually characterized by a power - law growth of the relaxation time , which does not appear to fit the data on supercooled liquids with reasonable low values of the exponent . unusually strong",
    "slowing down , with exponentially growing times , is however found near the critical point of some disordered systems like the random field ising model and is known as  activated dynamic scaling@xcite .",
    "an additional characteristic of the slowing down of the @xmath0 relaxation when approaching the glass transition is that it appears to be predominantly controlled by temperature and not by density .",
    "what is meant by this statement , and what are the consequences for potential theoretical explanations",
    "? experiments on supercooled liquids are generally carried out at constant pressure , overwhelmingly at atmospheric pressure . as a result ,",
    "a decrease of temperature also produces an increase in density ( typically a @xmath28 increase over the liquid range at @xmath29 ) .",
    "the question is whether the dramatic slowing down and the above mentioned crossover to superarrhenius behavior observed at atmospheric pressure are primarily due to an intrinsic temperature effect or to the influence of density , hence of packing .",
    "this can be answered by using pressure studies of @xmath0 relaxation and viscosity in glassforming liquids . a pictorial way of addressing the problem is to plot @xmath15 or @xmath30 as a function of @xmath17 at constant density @xmath31 and as a function of @xmath31 at constant @xmath32 , for the range of densities that is relevant to the @xmath29 phenomenon .",
    "an extensive databank for these properties is not yet available , but some relevant pieces are .",
    "from the available experimental data , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are seen to change typically by @xmath33 orders of magnitude along the isochores whereas a mere increase of @xmath25 order of magnitude is observed along isotherms : see figs .",
    "2 to 5 of ref.@xcite and fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite . a detailed study of this phenomenon is given in ref .",
    "one concludes that density seems to play a minor role compared to temperature , which indicates that the viscous slowing down of supercooled liquids , at least at low pressure , does not primarily result from a congestion mechanism such as described by hard - sphere models and simple free - volume theories .",
    "liquid models involving one or two components of spherically interacting particles , such as the binary lennard - jones system , are at the basis of many computer simulation studies and various approximate theoretical treatments .",
    "it is implicitly assumed that the characteristics of their viscous slowing down as temperature is lowered reproduce the main features of the phenomenology of real glassforming liquids .",
    "we focus here on the ability of such models to describe the marked superarrhenius activated behavior of @xmath0 relaxation and viscosity that , as stressed above , is a distinct property of real fragile supercooled liquids .    the most straightforward way to examine the relevance of the simple models is to plot the effective activation free energy @xmath23 as a function of the scaled temperature @xmath34 , or its inverse . to minimize bias",
    ", we use the values of @xmath23 _ and _ @xmath3 given by sastry _",
    "et al_@xcite in their study of the correlation between the properties of the inherent structures ( potential energy landscape ) and the slow relaxation .",
    "( note that on the basis of their plot of @xmath23 versus @xmath34 , with @xmath35 in lennard - jones reduced units , sastry _",
    "et al_@xcite pointed out that the binary lennard - jones model behaves as a fragile liquid . )",
    "the plots are displayed in fig .",
    "2a , where @xmath23 is measured in units of @xmath36 and in fig .",
    "2b where the deviation from the high-@xmath14 arrhenius value , ( @xmath37 , is shown .",
    "the result is striking : the binary lennard- jones system appears as a strange hybrid . on one hand",
    ", it has very weak intermolecular bonding that leads to a small value of the high-@xmath14 arrhenius activation free energy @xmath38 characterizing `` normal '' liquid behavior , in contrast to weakly - bonded ortho - terphenyl for which the ratio is @xmath39 , to intermediate h - bonded glycerol for which the ratio is @xmath40 , and to the strong network - forming @xmath19 for which the ratio is @xmath41 ; on the other hand , its departure from arrhenius behavior below @xmath3 , when properly scaled to be compared to real glassforming liquids as in fig .",
    "2b , is comparable to that of the _ strongest _ glassformers , such as @xmath19 , and is much less than that of fragile liquids like ortho- terphenyl .",
    "we conclude that the binary lennard - jones model appears to be a very weakly - bonded , but nonfragile ( in the sense of showing only weak superarrhenius behavior ) system .",
    "this conclusion , that contradicts the generally accepted view about the fragility of lennard - jones systems ( including the recent suggestion , based on a rather indirect argument , by angell et al @xcite that the binary lennard - jones mixture is a moderately fragile liquid ) , stresses the importance of a proper scaling of the available data . in the case of lennard - jones models , the conventional use of @xmath11 as a scaling temperature is questionable because the determination of @xmath11 requires an uncontrolled extrapolation procedure , with molecular - dynamics simulation data stopping some 10 or 11 orders of magnitude short of the typical @xmath0-relaxation time at the calorimetric @xmath11",
    ".    other systems like one - component liquid models with atoms interacting through the lennard - jones and the dzugutov@xcite potentials are also very nonfragile .",
    "( models of molecular liquids like ortho - terphenyl are not considered here . )",
    "anticipating the analysis in the next section , we quantify the `` fragility '' of a system by a parameter @xmath42 that measures its degree of departure from arrhenius behavior ( in a plot of ( @xmath43 versus @xmath34 ) : the more fragile a system , the more superarrhenius the @xmath14-dependence of its viscosity and @xmath0-relaxation time , the larger @xmath42 .",
    "for instance , the value of @xmath42 is found to be more than @xmath44 for the very fragile ortho - terphenyl whereas it is equal to @xmath45 for the strong glassformer @xmath19 , and to @xmath46 for the intermediate system glycerol@xcite ; in contrast we have found @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 for the one - component lennard - jones , the dzugutov , and the binary lennard - jones systems , respectively is inversely related to the strength of the inherent structural frustration in the system .",
    "the small values of @xmath42 for the simple atomistic models composed of one or two species of spherical particles indicate that they are strongly frustrated .",
    "this can also be inferred from the work of nelson and coworkers@xcite on metallic glasses , where it was found that the density of defects associated with the frustration of icosahedral order is high , so that correlation lengths never grow significantly beyond the interatomic distance.]@xcite , values characteristic of very nonfragile liquids .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath42 are somewhat dependent upon the fitting procedure , since the range of available relaxation times is much more limited for these computer studied systems than for real glassforming liquids ; however , the fact that the obtained values of @xmath42 are typical of nonfragile liquids , with @xmath50 , seems robust .",
    "supportive of the above conclusion are also the recent studies of one - component lennard - jones systems in which the slow relaxation is described kinetically by means of an appropriate master equation , acting in a potential energy landscape@xcite .",
    "although finite - system - size effects , incomplete information on the connectivity between potential energy minima , and the use of other approximations in handling the master equation approach , can still cast doubt on the validity and the generality of the results , one notices the remarkable finding of these studies , that the temperature dependence of the viscosity and relaxation time of lennard - jones systems is arrhenius - like over the whole range of up to 13 decades in viscosity and time , a property suggestive of a nonfragile liquid ! see fig .",
    "3a of ref.@xcite and fig .",
    "10 of ref.@xcite .",
    "the discussion above does not , of course , diminish interest in the study of relaxations in simple atomistic models per se ; but it strongly questions the relevance of such studies in shedding light on the dominant mechanisms that lead to the glass transition of real fragile supercooled liquids .",
    "the description of the viscous slowing down of weakly - bonded glassforming liquids as a superarrhenius activated process with sizeable activation free energies is indicative of the presence of collective or cooperative phenomena ; in addition , the heterogeneous nature of the @xmath0 relaxation suggests that this collective or cooperative character shows up in supercooled liquids in the form of spatial domains , supermolecular regions over which dynamical properties are correlated .",
    "numerous models have been based on the existence of domains , clusters , fluctuations , cooperative regions , and 2- liquid phases@xcite . while providing a reasonable way of fitting or rationalizing pieces of the phenomenology",
    ", these models usually leave unanswered the questions of why heterogeneities or domains appear in supercooled liquids and how they account for the activated nature of the @xmath0 relaxation ?",
    "the theory of frustration - limited domains@xcite addresses these basic questions .",
    "it is a nonmolecular , `` mesoscopic '' approach , in which the driving force for domain formation and growth comes from an ordering transition that is aborted by the ubiquitous presence of structural frustration .",
    "we summarize this approach in what follows .",
    "the basic physical ingredient is the concept of structural frustration .",
    "molecules in a liquid , even in the `` normal '' range above melting , tend to arrange themselves into a locally preferred structure corresponding to the minimization of an appropriate local free energy ; but the spatial extension of this local arrangement is thwarted by ubiquitous structural frustration that prevents a periodic tiling of space by the locally preferred structure and is the source of a strain free energy that grows super- extensively with system size . as a result of the competition between the short - range tendency to order , i. e. , to extend the locally preferred structure , and the strain generated by frustration , the liquid , below some temperature @xmath3 , breaks up into domains whose structure is the locally preferred , but strained , one associated with the high-@xmath14 liquid , and",
    "whose size and further growth are limited by frustration .",
    "@xmath3 is interpreted as a crossover between normal , molecular liquid behavior ( @xmath5 ) and collective , domain - influenced behavior ( @xmath6 ) . as seen below , in the theory @xmath3",
    "does indeed mark the passage from arrhenius - like to superarrhenius @xmath14-dependence of the @xmath0-relaxation time and viscosity that we have stressed in the preceding sections .",
    "the above picture can be incorporated in a coarse - grained model based on an effective hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "the locally preferred structure of the liquid is characterized by a local order variable @xmath51 that can take a discrete set of orientations ( more than @xmath52 ) , as in a clock model .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of a reference term describing the short - range tendency to order and a weak , but long - range competing interaction that generates the frustration - induced strain : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a short - range `` ferromagnetic '' interaction with a typical energy scale @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the characteristic length associated with the local structure ( of the order of the mean intermolecular distance in a liquid ) , and @xmath57 . in the absence of frustration",
    ", the reference system undergoes a continuous ordering transition at a temperature @xmath58 .      due to the long - range nature of the competing interaction that gives rise to a superextensive cost in free energy proportional to @xmath59 , long - range order characteristic of the reference , unfrustrated system ( here , ferromagnetic order )",
    "is completely prohibited by frustration , no matter how small , but nonzero , this latter may be@xcite .",
    "a still stronger statement can be made about the system s behavior in the temperature - frustration ( @xmath60 ) phase diagram .",
    "an ordering transition , leading to a phase with modulated order ( a `` defect - ordered phase '' ) , can take place at a low temperature @xmath61 , but the critical point at ( @xmath62 ) is _ isolated _ , i. e. , no other critical points are present in its vicinity in the @xmath63 phase diagram .",
    "this property has been shown rigorously for the spherical version of the model@xcite and for the @xmath64 version@xcite with @xmath65 strictly larger than two ) , the transition line to the defect - ordered phases goes continuously , albeit nonanalytically , to the critical point at @xmath3 when @xmath66 .",
    "however , the transition in the presence of frustration is not continuous : it is driven _ first - order _ by the fluctuations@xcite .",
    "] , for which @xmath67 is significantly less than @xmath3 . for weak frustration , @xmath68 , the critical point at @xmath3",
    "is _ narrowly avoided _ , which results in the presence of two supermolecular lengths below @xmath3 : the correlation length @xmath69 of the reference system , @xmath70 with @xmath71 for all standard @xmath27-dimensional critical systems in the absence of quenched disorder , and a new length , @xmath72 , that is the characteristic scale over which the physics is essentially that of the unfrustrated system ( which is ordered , since @xmath6 ) and that can be identified with the typical domain size@xcite .      at temperatures sufficiently below @xmath3 , so that @xmath73 , one can develop scaling arguments to describe the collective contribution to both static and dynamic properties .",
    "the liquid is considered as a collection of ( slightly ) polydisperse , frustration - limited domains whose mesoscopic order parameters are randomly oriented .",
    "the static scaling analysis starts with the formulation of the free - energy density of a domain of size @xmath74 in a random environment@xcite , @xmath75 where , as in a standard nucleation picture , the surface tension ( @xmath76 ) scales as @xmath77 and the ordering bulk free - energy density ( @xmath78 ) as @xmath79 ; the additional term describes the frustration - induced strain , whose coefficient @xmath80 is _ a priori _ unknown . assuming that the _ inter_-domain interactions are sufficiently weak to be treated by a mean - field approach",
    ", one can derive the scaling form of the strain coefficient @xmath80 by identifying the length that minimizes the free - energy density with the typical domain size @xmath81 , namely @xmath82 ; this leads to the equilibrium distribution of domain sizes , @xmath83 , in a scaled form , @xmath84,\\ ] ] where the entire temperature dependence is contained in the parameter @xmath85 and @xmath86 is a number of order 1 .",
    "the presence below @xmath3 of internally ordered domains leads to slow , activated dynamics of the ( discrete ) order variable . by generalizing simple dynamic scaling arguments about slow relaxation in a finite - size system below its ordering transition via defect - wall creation",
    ", one can evaluate the collective ( or cooperative ) contribution to the activation free energy , @xmath87 , for a domain of size @xmath74 ; this latter takes the following scaled form@xcite , @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are numbers of order 1 , with @xmath91 .",
    "the full effective activation free energy is then obtained by adding the molecular , arrhenius - like contribution , @xmath92 , to the above expression .",
    "it is important to stress that the domains are equilibrium entities ( in a supercooled liquid they are of course metastable relative to the crystal ) , and that the slow , activated dynamics does _ not _ correspond to out - of - equilibrium domain coarsening .",
    "the central point of the theory concerns the prediction of a crossover from molecular , normal liquid behavior to collective , domain - dominated behavior around @xmath3 , a crossover that explains the change from arrhenius - like to superarrhenius @xmath14-dependence of the viscosity and @xmath0-relaxation time .",
    "the superarrhenius contribution to the activation free energy is described by a universal power law , i. e. , @xmath93 a prediction that fits well the extant experimental data on glassforming liquids .",
    "a central feature of the theory is that it predicts the nontrivial , and somewhat unusual , universal exponent @xmath94 , which has been reasonably well verified by experiment@xcite . for an illustration ,",
    "2b as well as refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 in eq .",
    "6 is a measure of the departure from arrhenius behavior , hence of `` fragility '' , and it is the one we have used in the preceding section about the relevance of simple atomistic systems . from the scaling analysis , we obtain that @xmath95 , so that the more fragile ( superarrhenius ) a liquid , the less frustrated .",
    "the dynamics are also naturally described as heterogeneous below the temperature @xmath3 at which the liquid breaks up into supermolecular domains .",
    "for instance , the nonexponential character of the dielectric relaxation can be simply modeled by assuming that molecular reorientations are completed within a single domain , in which they are dynamically coupled to the order variable , and by assuming that the relaxation within each domain is exponential in time .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the ( normalized ) dielectric relaxation function@xcite : @xmath96,\\ ] ] for which @xmath97 ) and @xmath98 are given by the theory . as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , by comparing to the experimental data on the imaginary part of the frequency - dependent dielectric susceptibility of the fragile glassformer salol@xcite , the above equation ( or rather the fourier transform of @xmath99 ) , together with the scaling expressions for @xmath83 and @xmath87 given in eqs . 4 and 5 ,",
    "allow one to reproduce quite well the main features of the @xmath0 relaxation with a small set of temperature - independent parameters .",
    "more details will be given in a forthcoming publication .",
    "the relevance of the frustration - limited domain theory to the description of other aspects of the phenomenology of supercooled liquids , such as the decoupling of translational and rotational relaxation , the avoidance of the kauzmann entropic catastrophe , and the possible observation of `` defect - ordered phases '' at low temperature , is discussed elsewhere@xcite .",
    "a fundamental theoretical uncertainty yet to be resolved is whether the assumptions that underlie the phenomenological scaling analysis leading to activated , heterogeneous dynamics evolve rigorously from the hamiltonian in eq . 2 ( completed by some short - time dynamics for the spin variables ) .",
    "a more physical problem is that of mapping the local order and the frustration in a given liquid , however they are defined , onto the local order variable , @xmath100 , and onto the frustration parameter @xmath101 ( or equivalently onto @xmath42 ) .",
    "in this article , we stress that the salient feature to be explained about the glass transition is the temperature - controlled superarrhenius activated nature of the viscous slowing down of supercooled liquids , more strikingly seen in weakly - bonded , fragile systems .",
    "in the light of this observation , we have compared the behavior of simple models involving one or two components of spherically interacting atoms with that of real glassforming liquids and shown that , although being very weakly interacting systems , these simple models are at the same time nonfragile , in the sense that their viscosity and @xmath0-relaxation time show little departure from arrhenius temperature dependence .",
    "finally , we have summarized how our approach to supercooled liquids , based on frustration - limited domains , can explain the main aspects of the phenomenology , including the crossover from arrhenius to superarrhenius behavior and the heterogeneous character of the @xmath0 relaxation .",

    "<S> we propose that the salient feature to be explained about the glass transition of supercooled liquids is the temperature - controlled superarrhenius activated nature of the viscous slowing down , more strikingly seen in weakly - bonded , fragile systems . in the light of this observation , the relevance of simple models of spherically interacting particles and that of models based on free - volume congested dynamics are questioned . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss how the main aspects of the phenomenology of supercooled liquids , including the crossover from arrhenius to superarrhenius activated behavior and the heterogeneous character of the @xmath0 relaxation , can be described by an approach based on frustration - limited domains . </S>"
