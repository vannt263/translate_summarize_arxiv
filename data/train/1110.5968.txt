    "collisionless magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) shocks are found in diverse environments ranging from the inner heliosphere to the central regions of distant galaxies and other astrophysical objects .",
    "particle acceleration at these collisionless shocks is believed to be a common phenomenon in space plasmas . in the heliosphere , direct measurements of accelerated non - thermal ions and electrons in various energy ranges at the earth",
    "s bow shock ( e.g. scholer et al . , 1980 , mbius et al . , 1987 and gosling et al . ,",
    "1989 ) and interplanetary shocks ( e.g. , sarris & van allen , 1974 ; decker et al . 1981 ; tan et al . 1988 ; baring et al .",
    "1997 ) indicate energization processes that are intimately connected to shock environs . outside the heliosphere ,",
    "non - thermal particle distributions are inferred from observed photon spectra of supernova remnants , pulsar wind nebulae , blazars , and gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. blandford & eichler , 1987 , and references therein ) , all of which possess supersonic outflows that are readily shocked .",
    "commonly , these non - thermal distributions take the form of power - law tails that can extend to thousands or millions of times the ambient thermal energies of the particles .",
    "first - order fermi acceleration , often called diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) , is believed to be the primary acceleration mechanism in most collisionless mhd shocks .",
    "this phenomenon arises when charged particles interact quasi - elastically with turbulent fields in the shock layer , and are diffusively transported back and forth across the shock , each time achieving a net gain in energy on average .",
    "monte carlo simulations of this process ( see jones and ellison , 1991 , and references therein ) have had great success in modeling shocks inside the heliosphere and comparing them directly with in - situ measurements from various spacecraft ( e.g. ellison et al . , 1990b ; baring et al . , 1997 ; summerlin & baring , 2006 ) .",
    "it is quite likely that this same process is responsible for the power - law tails inferred in astrophysical shocks , including relativistic mhd discontinuites such as those believed to be associated with blazars ( e.g. see stecker , baring & summerlin 2007 ) and gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. see reviews by piran 1999 ; mszros , 2001 ) .",
    "early work on relativistic shocks was mostly analytic in the test - particle approximation ( e.g. , peacock 1981 ; kirk & schneider 1987 ; heavens & drury 1988 ; kirk & heavens 1989 ) , where the accelerated particles do not contribute significantly to the global mhd structure of the shock .",
    "since such systems are inherently anisotropic , due to rapid convection of particles through and away downstream of the shock , the diffusion approximation can not be applied .",
    "this renders analytic approaches , such as solution of the diffusion - convection fokker - planck equation , more difficult for ultra - relativistic upstream flows , though advances can be made in special cases , such as the limit of extremely small angle scattering ( e.g. kirk & schneider 1987 ; kirk et al . 2000 ) . accordingly , complementary monte carlo techniques , first developed for non - relativistic shock applications by ellison , jones & eichler ( 1981 ) , have been employed for relativistic shocks by a number of authors , including test - particle analyses for steady - state shocks of parallel and oblique magnetic fields by ellison et al .",

    "it is such a simulational approach that is highlighted here ; its accessibility to broad dynamic ranges in momenta is extremely desirable , providing a niche for monte carlo techniques in connecting with observations of astronomical objects such as gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and blazars .",
    "it should be noted that the most comprehensive way to study dissipation , acceleration and wave generation in collisionless shocks is with particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations , where particle motion and field fluctuations are obtained as solutions of the newton - lorentz and maxwell s equations .",
    "relativistic pic codes have blossomed to model shocks in applications such as grbs and pulsar wind termination shocks , focusing largely , but not exclusively , on perpendicular shocks ( e.g. gallant et al .",
    "1992 ; smolsky & usov 1996 ; silva et al . 2003",
    "; hededal et al . 2004 ; liang & nishimura 2004 ; medvedev et al . 2005 ; nishikawa et al . 2005 ; and spitkovsky 2008 ) .",
    "these works have explored pair shocks , ion - doped shocks , poynting flux - dominated outflows , and low - field systems with dissipation driven by the weibel instability .",
    "pic simulations are dynamic in nature , and rarely achieve a time - asymptotic state .",
    "none of these works has demonstrated the establishment of an extended power - law that is required in modeling emission from gamma - ray bursts and active galactic nuclei , though note the isolated recent suggestion ( spitkovsky , 2008 ; sironi & spitkovsky 2011 ) of a non - thermal tail generated by diffusive transport .",
    "the general difficulty with explicitly seeing acceleration in pic codes beyond true thermalization is perhaps due to the severely restricted spatial and temporal scales of the simulations , imposed by their intensive cpu and memory requirements . with the anticipated advances in computational capability over the next decade , pic simulations will become a much more powerful tool for probing dsa . for a discussion of relativistic shock acceleration , see baring ( 2004 ) .",
    "to date , much simulational work on dsa at relativistic shocks has focused on parallel systems ( where the magnetic field direction is parallel to the shock normal ) in which particles experience frequent small angle scatterings ( sas ) , as opposed to infrequent large angle scatterings ( las ) . in the limit of ultra - relativistic shock speeds , for differential particle distributions ,",
    "a power - law index of is realized , as can be found analytically ( e.g. kirk et al .",
    ", 2000 ) and numerically ( e.g. bednarz & ostrowski , 1998 ; baring , 1999 ; ellison & double 2004 ) . however , it is not necessary to assume that sas is the dominant scattering mechanism , nor is it warranted in some situations : the phase space for the character of small angle scattering to be realized shrinks with increasing shock lorentz factor .",
    "moreover , many astrophysical shocks , such as those in blazar jets , are either not parallel , or not ultra - relativistic . clearly , a more robust examination of the parameter space is desirable if one is to characterize the emission coming from these objects , and use it to probe their shocked plasma environments .    to effect such a goal , here",
    "we have extended our monte carlo dsa code ( summerlin & baring , 2006 ) to include shocks of arbitrary speed and obliquity , including the trans - relativistic regime . additionally , we generally presume an electron - positron plasma shock , following current thinking on the nature of grb outflows ( e.g. piran 1999 ; mszros 2001 ) and blazar jets , though the results apply equally well to ion - dominated relativistic shocks .",
    "the global structure of the shocks is defined via the rankine - hugoniot relations , solved along the lines of previous expositions ( e.g. double et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "principal output includes complete momentum and angular distributions , at different distances upstream and downstream of the shock . to demonstrate the validity of the simulation , and to distinguish its particular character ,",
    "comparisons are made with both theoretical and simulation results of other papers ( principally kirk & heavens , 1989 ; kirk et al .",
    ", 2000 ; ellison & double , 2004 ; niemiec & ostrowski 2004 ) .",
    "more importantly , we expand on these previous works by exploring the parameter space for oblique relativistic shocks comprehensively , focusing on the shock obliquity , turbulence levels , and parameters encapsulating the microphysics of the turbulent interactions , as key variables determining the high energy power - law index of the particle distribution .",
    "we find that , in relativistic shocks , unlike in non - relativistic shocks , the microphysics of the turbulence becomes an important factor in determining both the value of the power - law index , and how many decades in energy particles are accelerated before a power law is achieved .",
    "particles undergoing infrequent large angle scatterings consistently produce harder power laws than their sas counterparts and take many more decades in energy to realize a smooth power - law .",
    "it is also apparent that the power - law index is critically dependent upon the subluminality , versus superluminality , of the shock , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we find that , as do ellison and double ( 2004 ) and baring ( 2004 ) , in superluminal shocks , the power - law rapidly becomes softer with decreasing levels of turbulence and increasing obliquity , due to the difficulty particles have returning to the shock once they have crossed to the downstream side .    in distinct contrast , in the case of subluminal shocks , a decreased amount of turbulence and increased obliquity can actually render the acceleration process far more efficient as particles undergo the coherent process of shock drift acceleration ( sda ) , where some particles persistently gyrate in the shock layer , preferentially gaining energy due to the kinking of the magnetic field . in the limit of no cross - field diffusion and a de - hoffmann teller frame velocity of nearly @xmath0 , explored theoretically by kirk and heavens ( 1989 ) using semi - analytic solutions to the diffusion - convection equation",
    ", an extremely low value of the power - law index around @xmath1 becomes possible .",
    "however , with our simulation , we are able to more readily isolate how such flat distributions arise . in marginally subluminal shocks with sas operating",
    ", a small fraction of high energy particles are reflected off the shock by the kink in the magnetic field .",
    "for those that do reflect , the angular distribution for subsequent shock encounters is such that the transmission region is almost entirely depleted , resulting in virtually 100% reflection at each shock encounter .",
    "these particles essentially become trapped and are accelerated to very high energies very quickly , before they are eventually lost downstream . the extremely low levels of turbulence necessary to permit sda to act unabated",
    "almost certainly do not occur in nature , but the effects of sda can be seen to a lesser degree in shocks with more realistic parameters . in general , it can be concluded that the power - law indices in relativistic shocks can sample a broad range , depending on the three basic system parameters explored here . after outlining our simulation technique in sec .",

    "the monte carlo simulation technique employed in this paper closely follows the pioneering work on this method by ellison , jones & eichler ( 1981 ) and ellison & eichler ( 1984 ) ; see jones & ellison ( 1991 ) for a review .",
    "it is a test - particle simulation that models convection and diffusion of charges in a turbulent , shocked flow , complementing the analytic approach of bell ( 1978 ) that was extended to the relativistic regime by peacock ( 1981 ) . it has been successfully applied in a variety of environments including , the earth s bow shock ( ellison , mbius & paschmann 1990b ) , interplanetary shocks ( e.g baring et al . 1997 ;",
    "summerlin & baring 2006 ) , the solar wind termination shock ( see ellison et al . 1999 ) , supernova remnants ( see baring et al . 1999 ; baring & summerlin 2007 ) , and in the regime of highly relativistic shocks that is generally encountered in extragalactic contexts ( e.g. ellison et al . 1990a ; ellison & double 2004 ; stecker , baring & summerlin 2007 ) .",
    "the code models particle gyration about bulk magnetic fields in convecting fluid flows , while having their trajectories perturbed by embedded hydromagnetic turbulence .",
    "the perturbations mediate spatial diffusion that permits some small fraction of particles to transit the shock front multiple times , kinematically sampling the difference in flow speeds on either side of the shock , and thereby being accelerated via first - order fermi ( or diffusive ) shock acceleration ( see bell 1978 ; jones & ellison 1991 ) .",
    "the code is fully relativistic and transitions seamlessly from non - relativistic to relativistic flow regimes ; it also treats arbitrary orientations of the mean magnetic field .",
    "the simulation space is divided into a distinct number of grid zones distributed along the x - axis , which is here defined to be the direction normal to the planar shock surface .",
    "the boundaries of these grid zones are locations where the bulk properties of the fluid ( flow speeds , magnetic fields , etc . ) can change .",
    "the values of these fluid properties are specified _ a priori _ , and for the test - particle implementation of the simulation in this paper , have fixed values throughout the simulation runs . in the simulations presented in this paper a simple step function shock is used with only 2 gridzones : one upstream , and one downstream .",
    "the field and fluid quantities in these two zones are related by the fully - relativistic , rankine - hugoniot jump conditions , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : rhrel ] below .",
    "this construction facilitates the generalization to non - linear acceleration regimes ( e.g. ellison & eichler 1984 ; ellison , baring & jones 1996 ; see also ellison & double , 2002 , for the first treatment of non - linear modification of relativistic shocks ) , where the energetic particles contribute to the grid - by - grid specification of mhd quantities constrained by energy / momentum flux conservation .",
    "particles are injected isotropically into the system anywhere along the x - axis , though usually an upstream injection is adopted .",
    "the energy distribution of injected particles can be either mono - energetic , a thermal maxwell - boltzmann form at any temperature ( relativistic or non - relativistic ) , or a power - law distribution in momentum of arbitrary index . for non - relativistic shocks with thermal particle injection , the code automatically calculates the rankine - hugoniot shock jump conditions to ascertain the downstream fluid and field vector values . for relativistic shocks ,",
    "the jump condition solution technique is necessarily more complicated , as described in sec .",
    "this solution is accomplished outside the simulation program , and the jump conditions are then input manually as initial conditions for the simulation runs .",
    "the code can also include multiple species of charged particles ( e.g. treating hydrogenic and pair plasmas , and even contributions from helium ) besides the test - particles in the determination of the jump conditions .",
    "after particles are injected into the upstream fluid , they are allowed to gyrate in the local bulk magnetic field , convecting with the fluid , until it is determined that a phenomenological scattering occurs .",
    "the effects of magnetic turbulence are simulated by specifying a local _ fluid frame _ mean free path for particle diffusion , given by @xmath2 where is the gyroradius of an ion or electron of momentum , mass , and charge in a magnetic field . also is the gyroradius of an ion with a speed equal to the velocity component , , of the far upstream flow normal to the shock plane ; here denotes the direction normal to the shock . without loss of generality ,",

    "( [ eq : mfp ] ) .",
    "this phenomenological prescription for scattering was adopted in numerous papers outlining results from the monte carlo technique , including ellison , jones & eichler ( 1981 ) , ellison , jones & reynolds ( 1990a ) , ellison , baring & jones ( 1995 , 1996 ) , and stecker , baring & summerlin ( 2007 ) . following this and other previous monte carlo work , for simplicity , we set , a specialization that is appropriate for traveling interplanetary shocks : see ellison et al .",

    "the simulation can easily accommodate other values of , however , the spectral results are somewhat insensitive to the choice of this parameter  its dominant effect is to modify the relative scale lengths for diffusion at different particle momenta . since is required for physically meaningful diffusion resulting from gyro - resonant wave - particle interactions , the case is also motivated on fundamental grounds .",
    "the mean free path represents the spatial scale in the local fluid frame on which the momentum vector is deflected by @xmath3 , on average .",
    "note that for diffusion that is driven by non - gyroresonant interactions with field turbulence , perhaps grown via filamentation or weibel instabilities , it is quite possible to sample regimes , especially when the ambient magnetic field is quite low .",
    "diffusion in this domain resembles the bohm limit of for gyroresonant diffusion , and accordingly the distributions for shock - accelerated charges are only mildly dependent on when it is less than unity . for high",
    "alfvnic mach number shocks , the scattering is approximately elastic in the fluid frame , i.e. , is conserved in this frame for interactions with field turbulence that perturb a particle s pitch angle , gyrophase and orbital gyrocenter .",
    "when the alfvnic mach number is low , the alfvn waves move with appreciable speed in the fluid frame , so that partial inelasticity in scatterings arises .",
    "this yields second order , stochastic diffusion contributions . while these can be routinely modeled in the simulation , inspection of eqs .",

    "the astrophysical shocks of interest generally have large enough alfvnic mach numbers to neglect the effects of second - order acceleration .",
    "however , note that for near - luminal shocks at slightly suprathermal energies , particles are generally unable to convect upstream against the downstream flow and are inexorably swept downstream . in this energy regime , other mechanisms acting in the shock environs such as second - order fermi acceleration or electrostatic cross - shock potentials may noticeably broaden / heat the downstream distribution function .",
    "this can then enhance injection into the first - order acceleration process , and thereby affect the normalization of the power - law tail that results , particularly in cases of strongly - inhibited injection .",
    "notwithstanding , treatment of stochastic acceleration effects will be deferred to future work .",
    "the simplest invocation of scattering is to isotropize the fluid frame momentum over the surface of the sphere in momentum space ( ellison et al . , 1990a ) .",
    "this is large angle scattering ( las ) , and physically corresponds to large magnetic disturbances that completely disrupt trajectories of particles . to model moderate or even smaller disturbances , each scattering event can be restricted to a much smaller solid angle",
    ", i.e. can be isotropic on a conical sector of a momentum sphere .",
    "the angular extent of this spherical sector becomes an additional parameter for the diffusion .",
    "then multiple scattering events are required to realize a full mean free path .",
    "this is the scattering construct that is employed in this paper .",
    "the relationship between and was originally developed in ellison et al .",
    "( 1990a ) , but is more succinctly presented in ellison and double ( 2004 ) via @xmath4 where is the gyro - radius , and is the number of times per gyroradius the particle is scattered .",
    "the limit of small angle scattering ( sas ) corresponds to , for which the increment in momentum in a scattering satisfies . in practice , as will become evident below , for relativistic shocks the sas domain is realized when the scattering angle satisfies , where is the bulk lorentz factor of the upstream fluid in the shock rest frame .",
    "cross - field diffusion emerges naturally from this scattering mechanism since , at every scattering , the particle s momentum vector is shifted in the local fluid frame , with the resulting effect that the gyrocenter of the particle is shifted randomly by a distance of order in the plane orthogonal to the local field .",
    "transport perpendicular to the field is then governed by a kinetic theory description , so that the ratio of the spatial diffusion coefficients parallel ( ) and perpendicular ( ) to the magnetic field is given by ( see forman , jokipii & owens 1974 ; ellison , baring & jones 1995 , for detailed expositions ) .",
    "hence , couples directly to the amount of cross - field diffusion and is a measure of the level of turbulence in the system , i.e. , is an indicator of .",

    ", there is little variation in the power law tails when other parameters are held constant , since the scatter angle is now less than the relativistic beaming angle , and the diffusion process becomes insensitive to the scattering kernel . except for sec .",
    "[ sec_las ] , sas is deployed throughout this paper .",
    "examples of the differences between small and large angle scattering in relativistic shocks can be seen fig . 2 of stecker , baring & summerlin ( 2007 ) , and also in fig .",
    "[ fig : sas_las_plot ] .    in between each of the scatterings per mean free path , the code calculates shock frame gyro - orbit trajectories using a semi - analytic solver rather than the more popular bulirsch - stoer method ( stoer & bulirsch , 1980 ) .",
    "using the properties of the magnetized fluid , the shock frame position as a function of time is easily derived analytically .",
    "the particle is then moved along this analytic trajectory until one of two conditions is met : ( a ) the particle scatters or ( b ) the particle reaches the edge of a grid zone .",
    "the solution for the time it takes a particle to reach the edge of a grid zone must be performed numerically , since it involves roots of a transcendental equation of motion in the shock frame  the simulation employs a standard bisection technique for this purpose .",
    "when a particle crosses a grid zone boundary , the local fluid properties change , and the trajectory is recalculated and the propagation continues . when distances between scatterings are many gyro - radii , the semi - analytic method can go from one scattering to the next in one step covering many gyro - orbits in a single computational step .",
    "the bulirsch - stoer method will always require at least several steps per gyro - orbit due to the curvature of the trajectory .",
    "however , if particles scatter many times in one gyro - radius , the increased overhead of the semi - analytic method makes it slower than the bulirsch - stoer method , but not unreasonably so .",
    "particles that do not immediately return to the shock may isotropize in the downstream reference frame once they have traveled , on average , one mean free path . at this juncture , an analytical formula developed originally by bell ( 1978 ) and",
    "later shown to be applicable to relativistic shocks by peacock ( 1981 ; see also jones & ellison 1991 ) can be used to calculate the probability that a particle heading downstream through a - plane at a particular distance downstream will return upstream of this plane : @xmath5 in the above equation , is the local downstream flow speed , and is the speed of the particle in this fluid frame .",
    "particles that are deemed to fail to return are removed from the system . for those ascertained to be returning ,",
    "their vector velocity components are also determined probabilistically .",
    "the particles are isotropic in the local fluid frame and have constant energy in the downstream frame of reference thanks to the elastic scattering off magnetic turbulence .",
    "so , the probability of a particle of a given fluid frame momentum returning with a particular angle cosine with respect to the shock normal , , can be found for arbitrary values of the particle speed and downstream flow speed .",
    "the details of this calculation and final result can be found in the appendix , specifically eq .",

    "accounting of particles in distinct momentum bins is documented . as a result of statistical losses in the downstream region , when less than half of the particles originally recorded in a given momentum bin are retained , the remaining particles are  split \" into two particles each with half the  counting \" value of the original .",
    "this technique of particle splitting allows the simulation to maintain good statistics over a large energy range .",
    "this extensive energy range is one of the primary advantages that the monte - carlo technique has over other types of simulations .",
    "compared to hybrid plasma simulations and particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations , monte - carlo simulations are computationally inexpensive , allowing the simulation to be run long enough for particles to be accelerated to very high energies , well above that of the incoming upstream ballistic flow , in a reasonable amount of time .    in the test particle implementation employed here ,",
    "the characteristics of the shock and the functional form of the turbulence are specified _ a priori_. the test particle approximation is entirely appropriate unless there is a significant fraction of the total energy present in the accelerated particles . since the distribution of these particles is only known after the simulation accelerates them , the shape of the shock can not be adjusted to account for their existence until after the simulation is run . for",

    "also , since the choice of the scattering mechanism can affect both injection and acceleration of particles , it can strongly impact non - linear modifications for relativistic shocks",
    ". the influence of different scattering scenarios in such non - linear acceleration systems will be the subject of future work .",
    "this implementation also does not retain accounting of the amount of time the particle would have spent downstream of this `` return '' plane . in the event that acceleration time information is needed ,",

    "one important finding is that the interplay between energy boosting and time dilation effects leads only to modest changes ( baring 2002 ) in the acceleration time at plane - parallel relativistic shocks compared with standard non - relativistic shock formalism ( forman , jokipii & owens 1974 ) .",
    "the consideration of particle acceleration times is beyond the scope of the present work , and will be deferred to a future investigation .",
    "in the case of relativistic shocks , the shock jump conditions are considerably more difficult to solve than the non - relativistic solutions presented in decker ( 1988 ) , due to the impact of length contraction and time dilation effects on the structure of the six conservation equations .",
    "there are different approaches to solving the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions in relativistic mhd discontinuities , surveyed in double et al .",
    "( 2004 ; see also gerbig & schlickeiser 2011 , for a recent exposition ) .",
    "our approach here builds upon previous work by ballard & heavens ( 1991 ) that formulates the rankine - hugoniot conditions in the de hoffmann - teller frame ( de hoffmann and teller , 1950 ; hereafter ht ) in a manageable form .",
    "the ht frame is a shock rest frame in which there are no * u * drift electric fields .",
    "this can be obtained from the local fluid frame by boosting along * b * , but can also be obtained as a combination of two boosts along the axes of the coordinate system to avoid a rotation of the coordinate system .",
    "the system of equations is then transformed from the ht frame into the normal incidence frame ( nif , in which the upstream plasma flow is parallel to the shock normal or @xmath6 direction ) , arriving at a system of three comparatively simple simultaneous equations in which the terms that become imaginary in super - luminal shocks are no longer present .",
    "these three equations are solved numerically after the jttner - synge equation of state is invoked to connect key thermodynamic quantities such as pressure and enthalpy , to the temperatures of the upstream and downstream relativistic maxwell - boltzmann distributions .",
    "this method encompasses a broad range of shock conditions , specifically ranges of sonic and alfvnic mach numbers , and transitions seamlessly from subluminal to superluminal regimes .",
    "our results are compared directly with that of the work by double et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , highlighting similarities , and also differences that result from a specific approximation to the downstream equation of state employed in that work .    before embarking upon the construction and reduction of the jump conditions , a brief summary of the subscript conventions adopted here for the different frames of reference is given .",
    "the ` f ' subscript will denote a quantity defined in the rest frame of the upstream ( subscript 1 ) or downstream ( subscript 2 ) plasma .",
    "ht frame variables will be subscripted with an ` ht . ' to distinguish nif frame quantities from those measured in the fluid or ht frames , they will denoted by an ` s ' subscript for the shock frame .",
    "additionally , will always refer to an angle the magnetic field makes with the shock normal , and will refer to the angle a plasma flow makes with the shock normal .",
    "when the ht frame is found via a single boost along the direction of the magnetic field , the field components are identical in the local fluid and ht frames , often the ` f ' and ` ht ' subscripts will be explicitly omitted for compactness of notation , i.e. , , etc .",
    "the character of the solutions to this system of equations is controlled by two key parameters , basically the relative scaling of the upstream thermal energy or pressure , and the fluid frame magnetic field energy density to the upstream ram pressure . here , is the velocity component of the upstream fluid normal to the shock , in the nif .",
    "accordingly , we define these via the sonic ( @xmath7 ) and alfvnic ( @xmath8 ) mach numbers : @xmath9 these are conventional definitions for non - relativistic shocks , and their extension to oblique discontinuities and relativistic systems does not lead to unique choices . for example , subjectivity is involved in deciding between and , and similarly for versus .",

    "[ sec : eos ] , so that is the square of the upstream sound speed .      for subluminal flows , where , the ht frame is an obvious choice in which the shock jump conditions can be written , since therein the jump conditions reduce to a simple form because the fluid flows along the magnetic field lines and there is no electric field .",
    "for the time being , we will restrict considerations to these types of shocks and later trivially generalize the results to include superluminal shocks .",
    "four of the shock jump equations are defined by the conservation of the mass , momentum ( 2 components ) , and energy fluxes across the shock interface are conserved .",

    "this variation of the power - law index with the position of a downstream observer relative to the relativistic shock represents a fundamental shift from non - relativistic shocks , where the distribution function is isotropic in all relevant reference frames , and the spectral index is virtually independent of position when downstream of the shock . to our knowledge , this is the first time this effect in relativistic shocks has been highlighted in the literature .          while small shifts in the power - law index can occur based on observation location and energy range in parallel shocks , the introduction of non - zero magnetic field obliquity creates more substantial ranges of power - law indices for the non - thermal particle component . in non - relativistic shocks , the power - law index is independent of magnetic field obliquity , and depends only on the compression ratio : ( bell , 1978 ; drury , 1983 ; jones & ellison 1991 ) . in relativistic shocks , the spectral index varies dramatically with obliquity , as will be exemplified in due course . in particular , the character of the spectral index with respect to field obliquity hinges critically on whether the shock is subluminal or superluminal .",

    "this dramatic steepening is a consequence of inexorable convection of particles away downstream of the shock .",
    "the only way to ameliorate this rapid increase in index is to reduce to values below around .",
    "physically , this corresponds to increasing the hydromagnetic turbulence to high levels that force the particle diffusion to approach isotropy : in a kinetic theory description ( e.g. , forman , jokipii , and owens ( 1974 ) .",

    "this assumption is technically valid only when particles gyrate a large number of times in the shock layer ( e.g. , see drury 1983 ) , which arises when the gyroperiod is far inferior to the time it takes to convect one gyroradius downstream , i.e. when . for magnetic moment",

    "this energization proportionality is clearly evident during shock interactions for the selected particle , and is an established hallmark of sda . but notably , on larger scales , for both and , it is also an approximate description of the cumulative energization spanning multiple shock encounters .",
    "this follows as a consequence of the constancy of and only moderate changes to during upstream excursions ; i.e. material energy changes arise only during shock interactions .",
    "the curve s behavior shows smooth and rapid energization during gyrations in the shock layer followed by a quasi - oscillatory epoch for coupled with random spatial diffusion during the upstream excursions .",

    "however , this alone can not create such an unusually hard power - law . in the case of non - relativistic shocks",
    ", this process happens commonly in oblique shocks when low levels of turbulence are assumed , with no impact on the power - law index : it still retains its value ( see jokipii 1982 ; lee 1984 ; armstrong et al . , 1985 ;",

    "this is because the energy gained through shock drift acceleration ( sda ) is exactly canceled by decreases in the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) in oblique shocks , since the angular distribution is effectively isotropic in the nif and fluid frames .",
    "furthermore , this isotropy guarantees that select particles are not trapped in the shock layer for long durations , because they have the same probability of being reflected at each shock encounter .",
    "however , in the case of oblique subluminal shocks whose ht frame speed is approaching the speed of light , we find different circumstances .    as discussed in section [ sec : parallel ] , in relativistic , parallel shocks in an sas scenario , the field - aligned component of the distribution function is depleted at the shock . while the first shock encounter is that of an isotropic plasma boosted by the upstream flow speed with a strongly field - aligned population of particles , the distribution of particles returning after being reflected the first time is missing these field aligned particles because the population has , in general , had insufficient time for any of them to become field aligned in the downstream direction before re - encountering the shock .",
    "this is a result of the fact that relativistic shocks preclude particle speeds from far exceeding the relevant flow speeds and becoming effectively isotropic in all reference frames .",
    "subluminal , oblique relativistic shocks exhibit this same behavior .",
    "upstreaming particles must initially have pitch angle in order to travel upstream faster than the field line they are on is being convected downstream .",
    "once they diffuse in pitch angle , they are quickly swept back into the shock before they achieve isotropy in the ht frame .",
    "thus , as in the case of parallel shocks , the field aligned , , component of the angular distribution function is depleted at the shock . yet",
    "only such field - aligned particles are capable of penetrating the magnetic bottleneck at the shock .",
    "the net result of this dearth of field - aligned particles is a significant reduction in the fraction of particles transmitted through the shock at each encounter .",
    "this enhances the probability of reflection hardening the power - law .",
    "as the ht frame speed approaches c , the transmission region can become completely depopulated leading to near 100% reflection and the observed power - law .",
    "the value of this index value is dictated by energy arguments . for long - lived trapping of select particles in the shock layer , energy in the particle population",
    "is transmitted from one lorentz factor bin to the next one above , with miniscule loss .",

    "it then follows that the energy increment in going from adjacent bins is , so that , i.e. .",
    "introducing significant losses reduces this energy increment , and thereby steepens the spectrum . along with the offering in baring & summerlin ( 2009 ) ,",
    "this is the first identification of the important role shock drift acceleration can play in determining the spectral index in relativistic shocks . in non - relativistic shocks , sda does not influence the spectral index .",
    "note that the highly enhanced action of sda is restricted to high and sas regimes . invoking a las scenario completely eliminates the enhanced probability of reflection as particles are isotropic after their first upstream scattering and encounter the shock as such : all subsequent shock encounters have the same probability of reflection as the first shock encounter . for sas scattering ,",
    "increasing the amount of turbulence present ( reducing ) allows particles to scatter into the transmission cone and subsequently softens the power - law as shown in figs .",

    "trajectories for such cases ( not shown ) exhibit a more `` wonky '' gyration and reveal prompt convection downstream , shutting down the opportunity for repeated episodes of coherent acceleration .",
    "a few comments are necessary on the feasibility of encountering parameters that drive hyper - efficient sda .",
    "the extremely large values of required correspond to very low levels of turbulence that are not anticipated near shocks : it would require a truly unusual set of physical parameters to produce power laws significantly harder than using this mechanism .",
    "it should also be noted that the bulk thermal particles that create these strong shocks must be cold compared to the flow speed in order for the shock to form .",
    "thus , despite the fact that they receive substantial kinetic heating during their first shock crossing , they will not meet the criterion and will have a reduced chance for reflection .",
    "particles may have only a couple gyro - orbits that pass through the shock during an encounter and the range of phases that permit them to reflect is reduced dramatically . for , it is physically impossible for particles to diffuse upstream along field lines and some amount of cross - field diffusion is necessary for particles to return to the shock at all .",
    "this creates an injection problem ; see ellison , baring & jones ( 1995 ) for a discussion of this in non - relativistic , oblique shock contexts .",

    "this becomes particularly pronounced in the case , an almost luminal shock situation , where convection of thermal upstream particles through and downstream of the shock is extremely rapid .",
    "the rapid decline of injection efficiency with is an important factor in interpreting the action of shock acceleration in astronomical sources , an issue discussed in section  [ sec : blazar ] .          in superluminal shocks , it is physically impossible for even particles moving at the speed of light to diffuse upstream along the field lines . without any cross - field diffusion ,",
    "the particles are inexorably swept downstream after passing through the shock without reflection , regardless of their energy ; see begelman & kirk ( 1990 ) for illustration of such trajectories .",
    "thus , the particles in the low turbulence environment that relied on reflection for retention in the system are lost and not accelerated .",
    "consequently , the power - law becomes very soft .",
    "particles in high turbulence environments are not truly affected by the change in the obliquity of the magnetic field because they can travel across field lines as easily as they can along them .",
    "it is generally found that for decreased turbulence enhances acceleration in the power - law tail , and for , the opposite holds .",
    "this result adds new perspective to the paper by ellison and double ( 2004 ) , which presented results showing that the power - law tail indices in ultra - relativistic ( ) shocks are extremely sensitive to both and the obliquity of the magnetic field , with the power - law index increasing sharply as these parameters increase .",
    "these dependences are also seen in the mildly - relativistic shocks discussed here , but with somewhat less sensitivity to and .    while it is clear that an increase in will soften the power - law in oblique , superluminal shocks , the exact values of the power - law index are simulation - dependent .",

    ", the distribution function is necessarily isotropic to leading order , which restricts the power - law index to be only a function of the compression ratio .",

    "to briefly outline how these simulation results are relevant to astrophysical contexts , we discuss blazars , the subset of active galactic nuclei possessing relativistic jets of material emanating from the supermassive black holes at their centers ; these jets are oriented virtually towards the observer .",
    "blazars were discovered as a class of gamma - ray sources by the egret experiment on the compton gamma - ray observatory ( hartmann et al .",
    "1992 ) , and subsequently detected by ground - based erenkov telescopes at tev energies ( punch et al .",
    "the egret blazar measurements have been built upon in the last three years by _ fermi _ large - area telescope ( lat ) detections of dozens of blazars , offering improved spectroscopy .",
    "the tev - band signals typically exhibit steep photon spectra ( e.g. see krennrich et al . 2002 ; and aharonian et al . 2003 , for observations of mrk 421 ) that include the absorption due to pair producing interactions with infra - red and optical light generated by the intergalactic medium along the line of sight to the observer .",
    "extremely flat particle distributions are inferred in some blazars after correcting for this attenuation ( see , for example , stecker , baring & summerlin 2007 ) , with indices as low as in high redshift sources . coupled with the tev - band capability , the _",
    "fermi_-lat detections of blazars enable refined diagnostics by extending the observational window over a much larger energy range , and most crucially , including below the attenuation window . accordingly , _ fermi _ observations can probe more directly the underlying radiating particle population .",
    "the implications of this we explore here .",
    "the reader can consult baring ( 2011 ) and references therein for the interpretation of relativistic shock acceleration in gamma - ray burst contexts .",
    "pertinent blazar data from the _ fermi_-lat and tev telescopes can be found in the gev - tev blazar `` compendium '' in abdo et al .",
    "there is also the more extensive agn catalog of _ fermi _ in abdo et al .",
    "for the purposes of discerning indices of particle populations generating the gamma - ray emission , it is important to consider photon spectra below any turnovers that may appear in the lat band .",
    "this biases the data selection to below 1 gev , and a nice tabulation of this for _ fermi_-lat blazars is given in tables 5 and 6 of abdo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . therein , and in the various spectral plots given in that paper ,",
    "it is clear that there is a modest spectral steepening above around 1 gev in around 50% of _ fermi_-lat blazars ; this becomes much more pronounced above 100 gev . from this data compilation , we use photon indices of for pks 2155 - 304 , for mrk 421 , and for 3c 66a , as a sample blazar selection .",
    "the uncertainties on these indices are of the order of , which propagate into inferred particle indices .",
    "note that a sizable fraction of lat band agn indices in the catalog of abdo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) fall below , so that our choice here is reasonable .",
    "note also that 3c 279 is considerably steeper in the lat window , which could be a signature of a low - energy onset of the spectral turnover , or the operation of the klein - nishina regime of inverse compton scattering .",
    "consider first a standard leptonic model interpretation of blazar emission as emanating from inverse compton scattering by shock - accelerated electrons upscattering low energy photons .",
    "the relationship between the particle index and the photon one is then ( e.g. see chapter 7 of rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , if there is insignificant radiational cooling .",
    "this applies to synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) scenarios , where a single population of electrons emits the synchrotron radiation that it then upscatters to the gamma - ray band , or to an external supply of seed photons . for our select blazars ,",
    "these indices fall in the range , and are marked on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ u1_071_r302_r371 ] .",
    "they have an uncertainty . from this",
    "it is clear that for shock - layer diffusive scattering in the sas regime , acceleration at mildly superluminal oblique shocks provides a good description for all three of the blazars .",
    "this requires strong scattering , .",
    "if , i.e. , near the bohm diffusion limit , then mrk 421 and pks 2155 - 304 could be modeled with subluminal shocks .    to contrast this , consider an alternative picture of `` strong cooling '' by inverse compton scattering ( or synchrotron radiation ) .",
    "this corresponds to rapid acceleration of the leptons at shocks , followed by convection and diffusion away downstream into a larger radiative zone where the gamma - ray signal is generated over longer timescales .",
    "then , as is well known , the time - averaged effective electron distribution that radiates is a power - law of index ( e.g. , see blumenthal , 1971 , for an analysis ) .",
    "the steepening reflects a pile - up at lower lorentz factors induced by the fact that the energy loss rate for both synchrotron and inverse compton cooling of electrons scales as .",
    "the consequence is that now the relationship between the particle index and the photon one is .",
    "these indices are marked on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ u1_071_r302_r371 ] , and exhibit a shift of unity down from those in the uncooled case .",
    "again , they have an uncertainty . now , subluminal regimes are clearly suggested , and in the cases of mrk 421 and pks 2155 - 304 , move the inferences into territory .",
    "this opens up the question of whether such weak turbulence can persist in a blazar jet shock . however , there is considerable uncertainty in the spectral data , and increasing the scattering angle somewhat above the sas limit will reduce the value of required to generate a particular value of .",
    "these inferences should be viewed only as general guidelines , modulo the uncertainties in spawned by the precision of _",
    "fermi_-lat spectral index determination .",
    "we have selected one particular shock speed and restricted the discussion to sas regimes . clearly , there is a range of shock speeds , field obliquities , scattering angles and turbulence parameters that can satisfy a measured gamma - ray index .",
    "in addition , this discussion has focused on leptonic models ; in hadronic ones mediated by pion decay , generally approximately traces the particle index , mimicking the situation in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ u1_071_r302_r371 ] .",
    "significant klein - nishina modifications to the spectrum in the lat window can further complicate the interpretation .",
    "while more extensive study can hone the parameter space , broader gamma - ray coverage below 100 mev and multiwavelength modeling are necessary to make significant strides .",
    "the multiwavelength aspect is more immediate in terms of its possibilities .",
    "for example , if the acceleration at the shock is limited by synchrotron cooling in controlling the maximum electron lorentz factor , then the turnover in the synchrotron component is at an energy of ( for as the fine structure constant ) , a well - known result that is discussed in garson , baring & krawczynski ( 2010 ) with reference to mrk 421 .",
    "evidently , this energy must match that seen in hard x - ray / soft gamma - ray observations , providing additional constraints on that often may not be near the bohm limit of .",
    "this illustration serves to motivate future multiwavelength models of blazar spectra using complete distribution functions from acceleration simulations like those presented in this paper .",
    "this paper has presented new results from a robust monte carlo simulation that complement and extend previous semi - analytic and computational results .",
    "it employs the simulation technique devised by ellison et al .",
    "( 1981 ) that was extended to relativistic shocks by ellison et al .",
    "( 1990a ) .",
    "the simulation produces steady state distribution functions for planar shocks of infinite extent for large ranges of shock speeds , energies , and positions , simulating both the injection and acceleration of particles via first - order diffusive shock acceleration . by using the unique advantages that a simulation has over semi - analytic , diffusion - convection equation solution techniques",
    ", we are able to expand upon the work of previous authors by examining various turbulence regimes and probing individual particle trajectories .",
    "this affords specific insights that can not be gleaned from idealized cases that are analytically tractable .",
    "our body of results leads to several key conclusions :    * the power - law index in relativistic shocks samples a considerable range of values , and depends critically on the nature and magnitude of turbulence , the shock speed , and the shock field obliquity .",
    "this range extends from extremely hard power - laws with to extremely steep distributions where simulation statistics preclude discernment of acceleration beyond the thermal injection domain .",
    "notably , ultra - relativistic shocks do not necessarily possess the `` canonical '' power - law distribution , a result evident in the previous works of kirk & heavens ( 1989 ) , ellison & double ( 2004 ) , and stecker , baring & summerlin ( 2007 ) .",
    "* when small angle scattering ( sas ) is invoked , the value of defines a critical division point in the parameter space . when it is less than , oblique shocks in low levels of turbulence accelerate high energy particles extremely efficiently via shock drift acceleration , but when this quantity is greater than , turbulence becomes vital to injection and acceleration in oblique , superluminal shocks . in both cases ,",
    "weak levels of turbulence strongly inhibit injection from the thermal population . *",
    "invoking large angle scattering produces significant structure in the high energy particle distributions in relativistic shocks , a phenomenon first identified by ellison , jones & reynolds ( 1990 ) , but also generates slightly harder distributions than a similar shock in the sas scenario , where there is only a power - law with little discernible structure .",
    "these results represent important advances for determining the nature of turbulent shock environs in blazar and gamma - ray burst jets , and in other astrophysical objects .",
    "such interpretations are , admittedly , complicated by the particular spatial environment and radiation emission mechanism chosen for generating the observed photon spectra from these sources . yet",
    "global insights such as deciding between subluminal or superluminal shock environments are now possible .    to develop our model to aid future interpretations of astrophysical shocks , additional details of shock physics will be incorporated into the simulation . in shocks such as those discussed above with , a majority of the energy in the system will be found in the accelerated particles .",
    "the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions for the shock must then be modified , since a step function shock profile is no longer a valid approximation .",
    "this yields a non - linear acceleration phenomenon that is already seen clearly in the earth s bow shock , models of supernova remnant shocks , and the heliospheric termination shock ( e.g. , ellison , jones & baring 1999 ) .",
    "additionally , while this paper worked primarily with large alfvnic mach number shocks , in principle , low alfvnic mach numbers are possible in jet systems as well . while the rankine - hugoniot solutions presented above are fully capable of determining the appropriate jump conditions , low alfvnic mach number shocks may produce significant second - order fermi acceleration due to the motion of the scattering centers ( alfvn waves ) in the upstream and downstream rest frames .",
    "the code currently assumes scattering centers that are stationary in their respective fluid frames but can easily be adapted to include non - stationary scattering centers for the case of low alfvnic mach number shocks .",
    "in addition , preliminary work has also been done laying the ground work for future inclusion of cross - shock potentials in the simulation ( baring & summerlin , 2007 ) .",
    "the simulation is currently a single fluid model , treating electrons / pairs or ions . for electron - proton shocks",
    ", the disparate diffusion scales of the two species will cause their distribution functions to react to the presence of the shock on different length scales .",
    "this charge separation at the shock discontinuity induces an electric field that acts to restore quasi - neutrality , and can lead to significant energy exchange between ions and electrons .",
    "the inclusion of these effects and the determination of their impact on injection and acceleration of protons and electrons will be the focus of future work .",
