    "at asymptotic densities , the ground state of qcd with three quarks with equal masses is expected to be the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase @xcite .",
    "this phase features a condensate of cooper pairs of quarks which includes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 pairs .",
    "quarks of all colors and all flavors participate equally in the pairing , and all excitations with quark quantum numbers are gapped .",
    "the cfl phase persists for unequal quark masses , so long as the differences are not too large @xcite . in the absence of any interaction ( and thus in the absence of cfl pairing ) a quark mass difference pushes the fermi momenta for different flavors apart , yielding different number densities for different flavors . in the cfl phase , however , the fact that the pairing energy is maximized when @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 number densities are equal enforces this equality @xcite .",
    "this means that if one imagines increasing the strange quark mass @xmath8 , all quark number densities remain equal until a first order phase transition , at which cfl pairing is disrupted , ( some ) quark number densities spring free under the accumulated tension , and a less symmetric state of quark matter is obtained @xcite .",
    "this state of matter , which results when pairing between two species of quarks persists even once their fermi momenta differ , is a crystalline color superconductor .",
    "we can study crystalline color superconductivity more simply by focusing just on pairing between massless up and down quarks whose fermi momenta we attempt to push apart by turning on a chemical potential difference , rather than a quark mass difference .",
    "that is , we introduce @xmath9 if @xmath0 is nonzero but less than some @xmath10 , the ground state is precisely that obtained for @xmath11 @xcite . in this state ,",
    "red and green up and down quarks pair , yielding four quasiparticles with superconducting gap @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the number density of red and green up quarks is the same as that of red and green down quarks .",
    "as long as @xmath0 is not too large , this bcs state remains unchanged ( and favored ) because maintaining equal number densities , and thus coincident fermi surfaces , maximizes the pairing and hence the gain in interaction energy .",
    "as @xmath0 is increased , the bcs state remains the ground state of the system only as long as its negative interaction energy offsets the large positive free energy cost associated with forcing the fermi seas to deviate from their normal state distributions . in the weak coupling limit , in which @xmath13",
    ", the bcs state persists for @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these conclusions are the same ( as long as @xmath13 ) whether the interaction between quarks is modeled as a point - like four - fermion interaction or is approximated by single - gluon exchange  @xcite .",
    "the latter analysis @xcite is of quantitative validity at densities which are so extremely high that the qcd coupling @xmath15 @xcite . applying these asymptotic results at accessible densities nevertheless yields predictions for the magnitude of the bcs gap @xmath12 , and thus for @xmath10 , which are in qualitative agreement with those made using phenomenologically normalized models with simpler point - like interactions @xcite .    above the bcs state , in a range @xmath16",
    ", the crystalline color superconducting phase occurs .",
    "we shall demonstrate in this paper that applying asymptotic results at accessible densities yields a window @xmath17 that is more than a factor of ten wider than in models with point - like interactions .",
    "the crystalline color superconductivity window in parameter space may therefore be much wider than previously thought , making this phase a generic feature of the phase diagram for cold dense quark matter .",
    "the reason for this qualitative increase in @xmath18 can be traced back to the fact that gluon exchange at weaker and weaker coupling is more and more dominated by forward - scattering , while point - like interactions describe @xmath7-wave scattering .",
    "what is perhaps surprising is that even at quite _ large _ values of @xmath19 , gluon exchange yields an order of magnitude increase in @xmath20 .",
    "the crystalline color superconducting state is the analogue of a state first explored by larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite and fulde and ferrell  @xcite in the context of electron superconductivity in the presence of magnetic impurities .",
    "translating loff s results to the case of interest , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found that for @xmath21 it is favorable to form a state in which the @xmath5 and @xmath6 fermi momenta are given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 as in the absence of interactions , and are thus not equal , but pairing nevertheless occurs .",
    "whereas in the bcs state , obtained for @xmath24 , pairing occurs between quarks with equal and opposite momenta , when @xmath21 it is favorable to form a condensate of cooper pairs with nonzero total momentum . this",
    "is favored because pairing quarks with momenta which are not equal and opposite gives rise to a region of phase space where each quark in a cooper pair can be close to its own fermi surface , even when the up and down fermi momenta differ , and such pairs can be created at low cost in free energy . , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , one has equal fermi momenta for @xmath27 antiquarks and @xmath6 quarks , bcs pairing occurs , and consequently a @xmath28 condensate forms @xcite . if @xmath29 and @xmath23 differ , and if the difference lies in the appropriate range , a loff phase with a spatially varying @xmath28 condensate results @xcite .",
    "our conclusion that the loff window is much wider than previously thought applies in this context also .",
    "suitably isospin asymmetric nuclear matter may also admit loff pairing , as discussed recently in ref .",
    "] condensates of this sort spontaneously break translational and rotational invariance , leading to gaps which vary periodically in a crystalline pattern .",
    "if in some shell within the quark matter core of a neutron star ( or within a strange quark star ) the quark chemical potentials are such that crystalline color superconductivity arises , as we now see occurs for a wide range of reasonable parameter values , rotational vortices may be pinned in this shell , making it a locus for glitch formation @xcite .",
    "rough estimates of the pinning force suggest that it is comparable to that for a rotational vortex pinned in the inner crust of a conventional neutron star , and thus may yield glitches of phenomenological interest @xcite .    as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we shall restrict our attention here to the simplest possible `` crystal '' structure , namely that in which the condensate varies like a plane wave : @xmath30 wherever this condensate is favored over the homogeneous bcs condensate and over the state with no pairing at all , we expect that the true ground state of the system is a condensate which varies in space with some more complicated spatial dependence .",
    "the phonon associated with the plane wave condensate ( [ simplifiedcondensate ] ) has recently been analyzed @xcite .",
    "a full analysis of all the phonons in the crystalline color superconducting phase must await the determination of the actual crystal structure .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite studied crystalline color superconductivity in a model in which two flavors of quarks with chemical potentials ( [ mubardmu ] ) interact via a point - like four - fermion interaction with the quantum numbers of single gluon exchange . in the loff state , each cooper pair has total momentum @xmath31 with @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the direction of @xmath33 is chosen spontaneously .",
    "the loff phase is characterized by a gap parameter @xmath34 and a diquark condensate , but not by an energy gap : the quasiparticle dispersion relations vary with the direction of the momentum , yielding gaps which range from zero up to a maximum of @xmath34 .",
    "the condensate is dominated by those `` ring - shaped '' regions in momentum space in which a quark pair with total momentum @xmath31 has both members of the pair within approximately @xmath34 of their respective fermi surfaces .",
    "the gap equation which determines @xmath34 was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite using variational methods , along the lines of refs .",
    "it has since been rederived using now more familiar methods , namely a diagrammatic derivation of the one - loop schwinger - dyson equation with a nambu - gorkov propagator modified to describe the spatially varying condensate @xcite .",
    "this gap equation can then be used to show that crystalline color superconductivity is favored over no @xmath2 pairing for @xmath35 . if quarks interact via a weak point - like four - fermion interaction , @xmath36 @xcite . for a stronger four - fermion interaction ,",
    "@xmath18 tends to decrease , closing the crystalline color superconductivity window @xcite .",
    "crystalline color superconductivity is favored for @xmath16 .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , one finds a first order phase transition from the ordinary bcs phase to the crystalline color superconducting phase at @xmath37 and then a second order phase transition at @xmath38 at which @xmath34 decreases to zero .",
    "because the condensation energy in the loff phase is much smaller than that of the bcs condensate at @xmath39 , the value of @xmath10 is almost identical to that at which the naive unpairing transition from the bcs state to the state with no pairing would occur if one ignored the possibility of a loff phase , namely @xmath40 . for all practical purposes , therefore , the loff gap equation is not required in order to determine @xmath10 .",
    "the loff gap equation is used to determine @xmath18 and the properties of the crystalline color superconducting phase @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the diagrammatic analysis of ref .",

    "is dominated by forward scattering . in most scatterings , the angular positions of the quarks on their respective fermi surfaces",
    "do not change much . as a consequence , the weaker the coupling the more the physics",
    "can be thought of as a sum of many @xmath1-dimensional theories , with only rare large - angle scatterings able to connect one direction in momentum space with others @xcite .",
    "suppose for a moment that we were analyzing a truly @xmath1-dimensional theory .",
    "the momentum - space geometry of the loff state in one spatial dimension is qualitatively different from that in three . instead of fermi surfaces ,",
    "we would have only `` fermi points '' at @xmath41 and @xmath42 . the only choice of @xmath43 which allows pairing between @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks at their respective fermi points is @xmath44 . in @xmath45 dimensions , in contrast , @xmath46 is favored because it allows loff pairing in `` ring - shaped '' regions of the fermi surface , rather than just at antipodal points @xcite .",
    "also , in striking contrast to the @xmath45-dimensional case , it has long been known that in a true @xmath1-dimensional theory with a point - like interaction between fermions , @xmath47 in the weak - interaction limit @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect that in @xmath45-dimensional qcd with the interaction given by single - gluon exchange , as @xmath48 and @xmath49 the @xmath43 which characterizes the loff phase should become closer and closer to @xmath0 and @xmath50 should diverge .",
    "we shall demonstrate both effects , and shall furthermore show that both are clearly in evidence already at the rather large coupling @xmath51 , corresponding to @xmath52 mev using the conventions of refs . @xcite . at this coupling , @xmath53 , meaning that @xmath54 , which is much larger than @xmath55 .",
    "if we go to much higher densities , where the calculation is under quantitative control , we find an even more striking enhancement : when @xmath56 we find @xmath57 !",
    "we see that ( relative to expectations based on experience with point - like interactions ) the crystalline color superconductivity window is wider by more than four orders of magnitude at this weak coupling , and is about one order of magnitude wider at accessible densities if weak - coupling results are applied there .    in section",

    "<S> cold dense quark matter is in a crystalline color superconducting phase wherever pairing occurs between species of quarks with chemical potentials whose difference @xmath0 lies within an appropriate window . </S>",
    "<S> if the interaction between quarks is modeled as point - like , this window is rather narrow . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when the interaction between quarks is modeled as single - gluon exchange , the window widens by about a factor of ten at accessible densities and by much larger factors at higher density . </S>",
    "<S> this striking enhancement reflects the increasingly @xmath1-dimensional nature of the physics at weaker and weaker coupling . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that crystalline color superconductivity is a generic feature of the phase diagram of cold dense quark matter , occurring wherever one finds quark matter which is not in the color - flavor locked phase . </S>",
    "<S> if it occurs within the cores of compact stars , a crystalline color superconducting region may provide a new locus for glitch phenomena .    </S>",
