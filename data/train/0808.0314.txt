    "antiferromagnets in an external magnetic field show a variety of phase diagrams depending on the interaction terms present in the spin hamiltonian@xcite .",

    "bicritical _ point three phases - an antiferromagnetic phase , a spin flop phase and the paramagnetic phase - are in coexistence .",
    "the phase transition lines to the paramagnetic phase are second order transition lines , whereas the transition line between the spin flop and the antiferromagnetic phase is of first order . at the _ tetracritical _ point four phases - an antiferromagnetic phase , a spin flop phase , an intermediate or mixed phase and the paramagnetic phase - are in coexistence .",
    "all transition lines are of second order in this case .",
    "a field theoretic description of these models starts with a static functional for an @xmath6-component field @xmath7 of @xmath8 symmetry ( @xmath9 ) leading to different multicritical behavior connected with the stable fixed point ( fp ) found in the renormalization group treatment@xcite .",
    "bicritical behavior has been connected with the stability of the well known _",
    "isotropic heisenberg _ fixed point of @xmath10 symmetry , whereas tetracriticality has been connected with a fixed point of @xmath0 symmetry , which might be either the so called _ biconical _ fp or the _ decoupling _ fp . in the last fp the parallel and the perpendicular components of the order parameter ( op ) are asymptotically decoupled .",
    "the important questions which theory should give an answer to is , ( i ) which of these fps is the stable one in a three- or two - dimensional system , and ( ii ) what are the differences in the critical behavior at the multicritical point ?",
    "these questions have been risen and considered in one loop order@xcite , where the heisenberg fp turns out to be the stable one in @xmath11 for the case @xmath4 and @xmath5 , but this picture is changed in higher loop order . in a five loop order @xmath12 expansion it has been found that the biconical fp is the stable one @xcite .",
    "it also has been found that the differences between the exponents at the different multicritical points are much smaller than in the one loop order calculation .",
    "physical examples where such multicritical behavior has been found are the anisotropic antiferromagnets@xcite ( with the magnetic field in the hard direction ) like@xcite gdalo@xmath13 and@xcite mnf@xmath14 , as well as@xcite mncl@xmath144d@xmath14o or@xcite mn@xmath14as@xmath15 ( a = si or ge ) .",

    "in addition to the stability of a fixed point we want to mention that one has to consider also the attraction regions of a fixed point to answer the question wether one can reach the stable fixed point . in order to discuss the attraction regions one has to consider the flow of the couplings from the nonuniversal initial ( background ) values .    we therefore reconsider the critical behavior of systems with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "being interested in criticality of three dimensional systems , we will work within the minimal subtraction scheme and evaluate the results at fixed dimension @xmath11.@xcite for the universal properties ( as asymptotic critical exponents and marginal dimensions ) it turns out that already the two loop calculations refined by resummation are in good quantitative agreement with previous resummed higher order @xmath23-expansion results.@xcite however , contrary to previous calculations , the technique we use gives a possibility to analyze non - universal effective critical behavior which is manifested in a broader temperature interval near the ( multi)critical point .",
    "such calculations are out - of - reach the @xmath23-expansion and will be performed below on the base of analysis of the renormalization group flow .    the paper is organized as follows : starting from the static functional ( sec .",

    "the _ biconical fixed point is stable predicting tetracritical behavior if the fixed point is reached from the background_. the very neighborhood of the stability border lines is characterized by very small transient exponents .",

    "this indicates the possibility of a scenario mentioned already earlier@xcite where the multicritical point is a _",

    "the critical behavior of an isotropic system ( @xmath24 symmetry ) with short range interaction is determined by the static functional @xmath25 which is known as the ginzburg - landau - wilson(glw)-functional .",

    "the symbol @xmath27 denotes the scalar product between vectors .",
    "@xmath28 is proportional to the temperature distance to the critical point and @xmath29 is the fourth order coupling in which perturbation expansion is usually performed .",
    "systems represented by such a static functional have been extensively studied in the last decades with different renormalization procedures , and the corresponding critical exponents and amplitude ratios are known up to high loop orders ( see e.g.@xcite ) .    in order to describe bicritical behavior the @xmath6-dimensional space of the order parameter components will be divided into two subspaces with dimensions @xmath2 and @xmath1 with the property @xmath30 in the following .",
    "correspondingly the order parameter separates into @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the @xmath2-dimensional order parameter of the @xmath2-subspace , and @xmath33 is the @xmath1-dimensional order parameter of the @xmath1-subspace .",

    "the decomposition in parallel and perpendicular op components allows to describe the critical behavior at the meeting point of two critical lines : ( i ) the line where @xmath36 becomes zero and the @xmath2-dimensional components @xmath32 are the op , and ( ii ) the line where @xmath37 becomes zero and the @xmath1-dimensional components @xmath38 are the op . at the meeting point",

    "the procedure used to obtain the vertex functions appropriate for the renormalization is described in more details in the appendix [ vertex ] . from the general structure of the two point vertex functions presented",
    "therein follows that the order parameter functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the subspaces may be renormalized by the scalar renormalization factors @xmath40 the above relations and the definitions ( [ correlperp ] ) and ( [ correlpara ] ) imply that the correlation lengths , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , do not renormalize .",

    "a consistent renormalization of the @xmath51- insertions is only possible by introducing @xmath57 with the renormalization matrix @xmath58 the zeroth order of the perturbation expansion only appears in the diagonal elements @xmath59 , while the off - diagonal elements @xmath60 start with the one loop order . with ( [ phiren ] ) and ( [ phi2ren ] ) an arbitrary vertex function ( [ vertexfunc3 ] ) renormalizes as @xmath61 the indices @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are running over @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the renormalization introduced in the above relations removes the poles from all vertex functions except the functions @xmath67 which have to be considered separately .",

    "first , based on the two - loop expressions ( [ zetaps11])-([zetaps22 ] ) for the matrix @xmath114_{ij}(\\{u\\})$ ] ( [ zetaphiq ] ) we find its eigenvalues as expansions in renormalized couplings . in turn , the exponents @xmath115 , @xmath116 are expressed in terms of the corresponding eigenvalues as series in renormalized couplings as well .",
    "corresponding series are found also for the magnetic susceptibility exponents .",
    "the series are then resummed ( as described in the appendix [ resummation ] ) and evaluated at the fps .",
    "numerical results of the exponents @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 obtained by such evaluation are given in table [ tab3 ] in the ( stable ) biconical fp @xmath119 and , for comparison , in the ( unstable ) heisenberg fp @xmath120 .",
    "the expressions for the exponents @xmath121 and @xmath122 are too short to be resummed .",
    "therefore their numerical values are found from the familiar scaling relations @xmath123 , @xmath124 using resummed values of @xmath125s and @xmath126s .",
    "for the decoupling fp one has to modify the scaling relations according to the statements above and has to use @xmath127 , @xmath124 . note that within the accuracy of calculations results for the exponents that correspond to parallel and perpendicular fields do not differ ( the difference shows up within the fourth digit ) .",
    "the overall agrement with the 5 loop @xmath23-expansion is very good especially for the stable biconical fp .",
    "the resummation of the @xmath50-function has the big advantage to find the fixed point values and asymptotic exponents but in addition the flow of the couplings from their background values to their fp values .",
    "the flow is important for the crossover behavior but also for the discussion of the asymptotic multicritical behavior of physical representatives of such systems with different the background values of the couplings .",
    "their location in the attraction region of a fp defines the critical behavior ..      fig .",
    "[ flowres ] shows the flow lines in the space of the coupling parameters for different initial conditions calculated from the resummed @xmath50-functions .",
    "mean field theory states a criterion@xcite which has to be fulfilled by the fourth order couplings for the existence of a tetracritical point ; it reads @xmath128 the flow equations show that @xmath129 is not an invariant surface of the flow .",
    "however it contains several separatrices with the corresponding fixed points : the decoupling fps with @xmath130 ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 ) and the heisenberg fp @xmath135 .",
    "therefore in the region shown in fig .",
    "1 the mean field condition @xmath136 represents quite well the surface ( called mfs ) separating the attraction region of the biconical fp @xmath119 and the region of run away flows .    thus one can draw the following conclusions .",
    "a system with initial conditions @xmath137 lies outside the attraction region of the stable fb and its runaway flow indicates that a first order transition is expected . one would conclude that the multicritical point is a triple point . systems with initial conditions where roughly @xmath136 would flow to the heisenberg fp @xmath135 indicating that the multicritical point is a bicritical point . then finally if the initial conditions are such that @xmath138 the biconical fp @xmath119 is reached and the multicritical point is a tetracritical point . in this way the three scenarios sketched in ref .",
    "@xcite are realized .",
    "the important and open point is to connect the initial conditions of the field theoretic flow equations to the interaction parameters in the appropriate spin hamiltonian containing the anisotropic interactions defining the antiferromagnetic system .",
    "having available the solutions of the flow equations one can define the effective exponents evaluating the field theoretic @xmath89-functions at the values of the couplings given by the flow according to the definitions of the exponents in eqs .",
    "( [ etaid ] ) and ( [ nu ] ) .",
    "we substitute the couplings obtained from the resummed flow equations into the resummed @xmath89-functions appearing in the expressions for exponents . in this way the effective exponents become functions of the flow parameter @xmath113 , e.g. @xmath139 the effective crossover exponent @xmath140 follows from eq .",
    "( [ crossphi ] ) as @xmath141    results for the exponents are shown in the figs .",
    "[ gammaeff ] , [ nueff ] and [ phieff ] .",
    "the two exponents of the parallel and perpendicular op susceptibilities are almost equal even in the nonasymptotic region but might be quite different from the asymptotic value .",
    "especially due to the slow transient present the values for the flows 1 - 3 are smaller than the expected asymptotic values .",
    "the same holds for the effective exponent of the correlation length @xmath142 .",
    "the flow 6 which does not reach a finite fixed point lies within the expected values .",
    "the formal decrease of the effective exponents to unphysical negative values are due to the flow to infinite values of the couplings .",
    "we have shown that the two loop order perturbation theory together with appropriate resummation techniques is sufficient to calculate the multicritical behavior appearing in systems with @xmath0 symmetry at fixed dimension .",
    "the advantage of such a procedure lies in the accessibility of the corresponding flow equations , which allow a discussion of attraction regions and effective ( crossover ) critical behavior .",
    "we confirmed the shift of the one loop stability borderlines , with the consequence that the multicritical behavior for the case @xmath4 and @xmath5 is characterized by the stable biconical fixed point and not by to heisenberg fixed point .",
    "the discussion of the attraction region of this fixed point leads to the possibility of different phase diagrams depending on the nonuniversal initial parameters entering the flow equations .    in a next step",
    "the results will be used to reconsider dynamical critical behavior of the pure relaxational dynamics@xcite of these systems . for the bicritical dynamics of an antiferromagnet in an external magnetic field an extension of the above mentioned model",
    "is necessary since besides the op conserved densities ( cd ) have to be taken into account . in statics",
