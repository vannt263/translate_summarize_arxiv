    "since the lattice is compressed by pressure , the brillouin zone expands with pressure and hence dhva frequencies would increase even without change in the electronic structure .",
    "although there is no high - pressure structural data on kfe@xmath1as@xmath1 , a neutron study on bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 shows that the @xmath44 axis shrinks by about 1% at @xmath10 = 25 kbar , @xcite corresponding to 2 % expansion of the brillouin zone .",
    "the observed changes are larger than this and are opposite in the cases of the @xmath43 frequencies .",
    "we first consider the possibility of a lifshitz transition at @xmath5 .",
    "it seems that the @xmath17-centered cylinders are too big to disappear and too small to touch the brillouin zone boundary by the application of a moderate pressure of 25 kbar ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , and indeed the @xmath29 frequencies continue to exist above @xmath5 . the only possibility to be seriously considered is disappearance or fragmentation of the @xmath32 cylinder .",
    "however , fig .",
    "4(a ) clearly shows that the @xmath32 cylinder continues to exist above @xmath5 .",
    "we therefore conclude that no lifshitz transition occurs at @xmath5 in line with ref .  .",

    "we now turn to the global structure of the fermi surface above @xmath5 . at ambient pressure ,",
    "the @xmath32 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 cylinders have been estimated from the dhva frequencies to occupy 1.1@xmath464 , 8.4 , 13.0 , and 25.6% of the brillouin zone ( % bz ) respectively ( there are four @xmath32 cylinders per the brillouin zone ) .",
    "@xcite the present dhva data at @xmath10 = 24.7 kbar indicate that the @xmath32 and @xmath29 cylinders occupy 0.8@xmath464 and 9.2% bz , respectively , where we have used the average of the minimum and maximum frequencies and have taken into account the 2% expansion of the brillouin zone cross - section . as explained above , magnetic breakdown frequencies between @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    "are observed above @xmath5 [ fig .",
    "it indicates that the sizes of the two cylinders stay close above @xmath5 , and hence we can assume that the @xmath30 cylinder grows by about 1% bz from @xmath10 = 0 to 24.7 kbar as @xmath29 does . to conserve the total fermi surface volume",
    ", the @xmath31 cylinder would shrink by about 1% bz at @xmath10 = 24.7 kbar .",
    "these estimates indicate that the global structure of the fermi surface hardly changes up to @xmath10 = 24.7 kbar ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "nonetheless , there are noteworthy changes in the electronic structure .",
    "firstly , the three - dimensionality grows with pressure as expected . to quantify it",
    ", @xmath47 increases from 0.40 to 0.59 for the @xmath32 cylinder and from 0.038 to 0.069 for the @xmath29 cylinder as the pressure is increased up to @xmath10 = 24.7 kbar , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the difference and the average of the minimum and maximum frequencies .",
    "secondly , there is a decreasing trend in effective masses .",
    "4(b ) shows the effective masses of @xmath38 as a function of pressure .",
    "although error bars are large , a general decreasing trend can be seen both below and above @xmath5 .",
    "the effective mass @xmath50 can be expressed as @xmath51 , @xmath52 being the band mass .",
    "the mass enhancement @xmath53 is due to interactions between electrons and bosons such as phonons and spin fluctuations .",
    "since changes in the sizes of the fermi surface cylinders are not appreciable up to @xmath10 = 24.7 kbar as noted above , we may assume @xmath52 to be constant .",
    "then , the decreasing trend in @xmath50 translates into that in @xmath54 .",
    "we now discuss implications of our results .",
    "the increasing three - dimensionality and decreasing @xmath54 are generally considered unfavorable to superconductivity , and hence seem at odds with the increasing @xmath2 above @xmath5 .",
    "let us consider a mcmillan - type formula @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "the characteristic boson energy @xmath56 here is the spin - fluctuation energy @xmath57 , which is roughly inversely proportional to @xmath58 and hence to @xmath53 , where @xmath58 is the electronic specific heat coefficient .",
    "@xcite the above formula then produces a broad maximum of @xmath2 as the coupling strength @xmath54 is varied but not a minimum as observed .",
    "even with more elaborated treatments of spin - fluctuation mediated superconductivity such as refs .  , it would be difficult to reconcile the minimum of @xmath2 at @xmath5 with the decreasing @xmath54 within a single - band picture .",
    "the reversal of the pressure dependence of @xmath2 is therefore related to the multiband nature of the superconductivity in kfe@xmath1as@xmath1 .",
    "namely , it is caused by competition among different intraband and interband pair scatterings .",
    "finally , we consider whether @xmath5 is a phase transition or crossover ?",
    "the @xmath59 curve reported in ref .",
    "has a sharp v - shaped minimum at @xmath5 .",
    "since the authors take the view of a @xmath18-wave symmetry at ambient pressure , they have suggested a phase transition from a @xmath18 wave to an @xmath6 wave at @xmath5 . in comparison",
    ", the anomaly at @xmath5 in our @xmath59 data appears rather weak and gradual .",
    "also , the laser arpes study has provided strong evidence that the gap structure at ambient pressure is an @xmath6-wave one with accidental nodes , and results of a magnetic - field - angle dependent specific heat study are compatible with it .",
    "@xcite we therefore suggest another possibility that the minimum of @xmath2 at @xmath5 may be due to a crossover from a nodal @xmath6 wave to a full - gap @xmath6 wave .",
    "since the symmetry remains an @xmath6 wave , it is not a phase transition .",
    "@xcite existence of nodes on the fermi surface is basically unfavorable to @xmath2 because part of strong pair scattering contributes destructively to pairing .",
    "thus removal of nodes may result in enhancement of @xmath2 .",
    "we here pay spacial attention to a recent theoretical work .",
    "@xcite it successfully predicts a gap structure that is compatible with the laser arpes data , using interaction parameters estimated from band structure calculations .",
    "the predicted gap structure is an @xmath6-wave one in which the gap function basically changes sign between the two @xmath17-centered hole pockets in the unfolded zone , which correspond to our @xmath29 and @xmath30 cylinders , and has nodes on one of the pockets corresponding to our @xmath30 cylinder .",
    "more importantly , it also shows that if the intraband scattering within the @xmath29 cylinder is only slightly weakened , the nodes are readily removed .",
    "we have confirmed from bulk @xmath2 measurements that the pressure dependence of @xmath2 in kfe@xmath1as@xmath1 changes sign at @xmath5 .",
    "the ratio @xmath12 is enhanced above @xmath5 , and magnetic responses of the vortex lattice show qualitative changes across @xmath5 .",
    "these suggest two different superconducting states below and above @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "our dhva data have shown no drastic change across @xmath5 .",
    "the global structure of the fermi surface hardly changes up to the highest pressure of 24.7 kbar , and no lifshitz transition occurs at @xmath5 .",
    "only changes that we have observed are the increasing three - dimensionality and the decreasing trend in the effective mass .",
    "they are generally unfavorable to superconductivity within a single - band picture .",
    "we have argued that the reversal of the pressure dependence of @xmath2 is related to competition between different pair scattering processes and have proposed that it may be explained by crossover from a nodal to a full - gap @xmath6 wave superconductivity .",
