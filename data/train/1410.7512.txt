    "the properties of magnetic impurities in a metallic host have fascinated physicists for a long time , particularly after the publication of kondo s paper @xcite 50 years ago . in the meantime",
    "the field of the `` kondo effect '' has matured ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the open questions is the so - called kondo cloud .",
    "the idea is to divide the kondo ground state , the singlet state @xmath3 , into two parts with opposite ( net ) d - spins .",
    "the proponents of the kondo cloud argue that in each component there is a cloud of s - electron spins that compensates the d - spin .",
    "such a cloud has been theoretically derived @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this predicted kondo cloud has not yet been experimentally detected .",
    "if the host is pure ( except for the magnetic impurity ) then the range of this cloud is of the order of the kondo length @xmath4 ( @xmath5 = kondo energy , @xmath6 = fermi velocity of the s - electrons ) .",
    "one reason why an experimental detection of the kondo cloud has been so difficult is the fact that the kondo cloud is very dilute , about a single spin distributed over @xmath7 host atoms in a pure three - dimensional host with a @xmath8 of a few kelvin . in this paper",
    "we discuss the possibility to reduce the kondo length dramatically by using a disordered host with a finite mean free path @xmath2 . from superconductivity",
    "it is well known that a finite mean free path reduces the bcs coherence length from @xmath9 to a much smaller length of @xmath10 .",
    "although the underlying physics of the kondo effect and of superconductivity are quite different it is worthwhile to investigate the influence of disorder on the kondo length and in particular the extension of the kondo cloud .",
    "the influence of disorder on the kondo effect is investigated in a number of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "many focus on the extreme case of electron localization . in this case",
    "the magnetic impurity interacts only with a relatively small number of localized electrons , which in a way is similar to the case of small sample size .    in a weakly disordered host in three dimensions",
    "the electron density is in first approximation close to that of a pure host although the disorder causes some fluctuations . any such fluctuation at the position of the magnetic impurity results in a change of the kondo temperature .",
    "therefore a finite degree of disorder in the host yields a spread of the kondo temperatures for different realizations of the disorder .",
    "such profiles of the kondo temperature have been calculated @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to small disorder , i.e. @xmath11 , in three dimensions where the fluctuations are small .",
    "we consider a large host so that the spacing of the energy levels is much smaller than the kondo energy .",
    "we use the fact that the kondo cloud is already calculated for the pure host ( see for example @xcite ) and show that indeed the kondo cloud in a disordered host has a reduced extension of @xmath0 .",
    "we derive a relatively simple formula to calculate any polarization in the disordered host from the polarization in the pure host .",
    "the basis of this paper is the solution of the friedel - anderson ( fa ) impurity problem in the fair approach by our group @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . following wilson s ingenious idea of reducing the number of states by assuming a conduction band with constant density of states we subdivide the energy band into cells @xmath12 which are represented by a single state @xmath13 .",
    "wilson also normalized the energy and momentum of the electron states . since the presented arguments are not based on numerical calculations but on the discussion of physical properties we use in this paper ( and only this paper ) regular electron momenta @xmath14 and energies @xmath15 .",
    "the wave vector @xmath14 for the conduction band extends from @xmath16 . like wilson",
    "we use a linear dispersion relation between the energy @xmath15 and the wave vector @xmath17 in contrast to wilson we do nt count the energy with respect to the fermi level but set @xmath18 so that @xmath19 .",
    "the lower ( occupied ) half of the energy band is divided at the energies @xmath20 , @xmath21 , ... ,",
    "@xmath22 where @xmath23 @xmath24 forming energy cells @xmath25 or @xmath26 the width of the energy cells is @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "the energy band above the fermi level is sub - divided in a mirrored fashion .",
    "each cell @xmath12 contains @xmath30 eigenstates @xmath31 of the disordered host .",
    "( throughout this paper we denote the wave function @xmath31 , the creation operator @xmath32 and the annihilation operator @xmath33 of the same state by the same symbol @xmath34 with different decorations ) .    following wilson",
    "we represent all the states in a cell @xmath12 by a linear superposition of the eigenstates @xmath35 @xmath36{l},\\ \\end{tabular } \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ a^{2}={\\displaystyle\\sum_{j\\in\\mathfrak{c}_{\\nu } } } \\left\\vert \\widetilde{\\varphi}_{j}\\left (   \\mathbf{0}\\right )   \\right\\vert ^{2}\\ ] ] where the summation goes over all states @xmath37 with energy @xmath38 in the cell @xmath39  then the amplitude of @xmath40 at the origin is @xmath41 since the cell @xmath12 originally contained @xmath30 electron  states there are @xmath42 states left .",
    "these states can be orthonormalized with respect to each other and the state @xmath43 .",
    "the resulting states we might call @xmath44 . if the composition of such a state @xmath45 is @xmath46 then the orthogonality condition @xmath47 yields that all the other states @xmath48 have vanishing amplitude at the origin and do nt interact with the magnetic impurity .",
    "let the volume of the host be @xmath49 and the total number of electrons be @xmath50 ( i.e. @xmath51 per spin ) .",
    "then the average electron density per spin is @xmath52 .",
    "this electron density is in good approximation homogeneously distributed over the energy range from the bottom of the band up to the fermi energy , i.e. between @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the energy band .",
    "since the width of the energy cell @xmath12 is @xmath55 then this energy cell contributes the fraction @xmath56 to the electron density . on the other hand",
    "the density of the wilson state @xmath57 at the origin is @xmath58 . since all the remaining band states in the cell",
    "@xmath12 have zero density at the origin it follows that @xmath59    then the amplitude of the wilson state at the impurity is @xmath60 .",
    "this is the same amplitude as in the pure host .",
    "as long as we have a large volume ( so that the energy level spacing of the @xmath61 is much smaller than the kondo energy ) and neglect the small fluctuations in the local electron density due to the disorder we arrive at essentially the same hamiltonian ( equ .",
    "( [ hfa0 ] ) ) for the wilson states as in the pure host .",
    "this is because the conduction electrons enter the hamiltonian only through the energy of the wilson states and their amplitude @xmath62 at the impurity .",
    "the hamiltonian of the fa - impurity is given by@xmath63\\right\\ }   + un_{d,\\uparrow } n_{d,\\downarrow } \\label{hfa0}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the creation operators for the wilson and d - states .",
    "@xmath66 is the s - d - coupling which is proportional to @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the exchange interaction .",
    "therefore the mathematical form of the kondo ground state is ( in this approximation ) the same for the disordered host as for the pure one .",
    "but one has to keep in mind that the almost identical properties of the wilson states for the disordered and pure host are restricted to @xmath69 . at larger distances @xmath70 from the magnetic impurity the wave functions of the wilson states for the pure and disordered host are quite different",
    "this has important consequences for the extent of the kondo cloud .",
    "however , in the first step of the calculation we can essentially take the wilson hamiltonian of the fa - impurity in the anderson model for the pure host . since this hamiltonian is already solved we can use this solution for the future discussion .",
