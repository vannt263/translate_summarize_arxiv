    "therefore @xmath111 under these rather crude approximations .",
    "using the same argument as before we obtain @xmath112 which is a sufficiently weak dependence to be neglected .      the first contribution to dephasing in the experiment is the doppler effect , characterized by the two - photon doppler width . here",
    "@xmath113 is the atomic mass of cesium , @xmath114 is the temperature and @xmath115 and @xmath116 the wavenumbers of the two lasers , from which we consider the difference because the lasers are counter - propagating . at @xmath67c",

    "therefore we define this motional dephasing rate as @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the one dimensional mean atomic velocity .",
    "for a temperature of @xmath67c , this 1d mean velocity is @xmath122  @xmath123 .",
    "since both dephasing mechanisms are gaussian , the total dephasing rate is defined as @xmath124 .",
    "moreover @xmath118 is related to the total dephasing rate and on the interaction potential ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "first assuming rydberg interaction of the van - der - waals ( vdw ) type , we rename the relevant quantities as @xmath125 , @xmath126 ( motional dephasing rate ) and @xmath127 ( total dephasing rate ) . the width of the resonant shell is also given by @xcite @xmath128 by combining equations and we obtain the following self consistent equation for the motional dephasing rate @xmath126 : @xmath129 solving equation yields , so that the total dephasing rate is .",

    "since we are not in the frozen gas regime , aggregates are only spatially correlated like the ones shown in the inset of fig .",
    "1(b ) for a short period of time . at longer times",
    "the atomic motion will destroy the spatial correlations between the atoms . this will , however , have no impact on the fact that rydberg excitations are facilitated by already existing one . in the following",
    "we will estimate the size of the frozen aggregates [ fig .",
    "the time scale over which the ensemble can be considered frozen is given the transit time of the atoms through the resonant shell of width @xmath118 , given by @xmath137  ns . during this time interval",
    "the ensemble can be considered as a frozen gas for our purposes .",
    "we estimate the size of the aggregates that can be formed during this time in a very simplified model .",

    "@xmath142 is the rescaling factor for @xmath24 discussed in the main text .",
    "let us first consider one individual rydberg atom which acts as the seed for an aggregate . in the resonant shell ( sphere of radius @xmath143  @xmath3 and width @xmath144  nm , see eq .  ) around this first atom reside @xmath145  atoms in average .",

    "we approximate an @xmath51-atom aggregate to a sphere ( whose volume is occupied by @xmath51  rydberg atoms separated by the facilitation radius ) .",
    "then the entire resonant shell contains @xmath146 atoms . for each ground state atom in the shell , the time constant for the excitation is , and therefore the excitation rate of the @xmath147-th atom is @xmath148 . if we simplify the problem and consider that the atoms are excited sequentially , the probabilities @xmath149 that an aggregate formed by @xmath51 rydberg atoms at the time @xmath150 per pre - existing rydberg atom obeys the following rate equation : @xmath151 in the table in figure  [ fig : figs3 ] we show the solutions of these equations for aggregates consisting of up to 5 atoms at the time @xmath134 .",
    "the number of @xmath51-atom aggregates that are excited in the whole excitation volume during @xmath134 is given by @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the number of rydberg atoms which can act as a nucleation grains . as the excitation occur at the boundary of the already excited rydberg ensemble @xmath153 is only a fraction of the @xmath154 rydberg atoms .",

    "<S> the quantitative agreement for the time scale @xmath19 between theory and experiment is excellent . due to the complex pair state potentials and strong state - mixing that are crucial here </S>",
    "<S> , an adaptation of the rabi frequency has to be performed in order to use the two - level model ( i.e.  a model with a single rydberg state ) . in our simulations the rabi frequency is reduced by a factor of 0.38 ( for van - der - waals interaction ) and 0.23 ( for dipole - dipole interaction ) compared to the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> these factors are compatible with the @xmath51s-@xmath51s admixture that one can extract from the pair - state potentials @xcite . note that with dipole - dipole interaction there is a dependence on the system size due to the long - range character of the @xmath52 potential , hence the different rescaling factors applied in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the comparison of the experimental results to those of the model show that facilitated excitation is occurring , which implies that an aggregation dynamics takes place . </S>",
    "<S> the frozen gas approximation which is used to model the aggregation in @xcite holds strictly for time intervals of about 0.3  ns , the transit time of the atoms through the ` resonant shell ' ( see figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) . during this time aggregates consisting of up to 4 atoms are formed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their spatial correlations will then quickly decay to those of a non - interacting ideal gas . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that even after that time the aggregation of excitations continues at the boundary of the uncorrelated aggregates .    despite this effect </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between the experimental values of @xmath19 and those obtained from the simple theoretical model is in general good [ see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig3 ] ] . yet </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution differs as the experimental signal appears much more narrow in time than in the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this discrepancy to the inherent differences between the microscopics of the experimental system and the theoretical model ( e.g. the complex potentials and the atomic motion ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , when considering the temporal width of the signal , the simulations with dipole - dipole interaction seem to agree best with the experiment , which is realistic considering that one component of the actual interaction potentials is of pure dipole - dipole nature . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the model does not account for the fact that the excitation of isolated , i.e. not facilitated , atoms is in fact coherent .    </S>",
    "<S> another feature of the experimental data that is not reproduced by the theory is the small overshoot in transmission just before the system reaches the steady state [ for instance at 20  ns for @xmath56  @xmath6 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> remnants of coherent rabi oscillations can be ruled out given the large dephasing rates and large detunings with respect to the single - atom resonance . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the time scale of the overshoot , e.g. the time between the two maxima , does not show a specific dependency on the detuning , as is the case for rabi flopping . explaining this feature will require further study and a more sophisticated theory . </S>",
    "<S> note that ion effects can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> there are no ions in the sample prior to the excitation , otherwise they would act as aggregation seeds @xcite at @xmath57 and change the signal dramatically . moreover plasma formation would occur only once rydberg atoms have been excited @xcite and therefore can not explain our rydberg excitation signal . in spite of the low collisional ionization rate ( @xmath58  mhz @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> it might happen that in the course of the experiment single ions are created . </S>",
    "<S> however single ions will not disturb the aggregation dynamics , because of the similarity between the ion - rydberg and the rydberg - rydberg potentials @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have shown a facilitated excitation process of rydberg atoms in thermal vapor . </S>",
    "<S> we have characterized the dynamics by measuring power laws for all relevant experimental parameters . </S>",
    "<S> these power laws , as well as absolute numbers for the dynamics and rydberg density are in excellent agreement with those from a model for rydberg aggregation . </S>",
    "<S> these results were obtained in the framework of thermal vapors , but the general ideas also apply to experiments in ultracold atoms . in the ultracold regime </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to study how quantum effects influence the aggregation time scale when the strength of dephasing noise is systematically lowered .    </S>",
