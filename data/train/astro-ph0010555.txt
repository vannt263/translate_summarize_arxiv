    "the origin of the quiescent emission observed from low - magnetic field transient neutron stars ( nss ) has posed something of a puzzle . when first discovered observationally ( in the transient cen  x-4 ; jvp87 ) , the x - ray emission , fit with a blackbody spectrum , was too faint to have originated over the entire surface of a 10  km ns .",
    "it was suggested that the emission was due to accretion over a fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the ns surface . as additional quiescent ns x - ray spectra",
    "were observed and fit with a blackbody spectrum @xcite , the small implied emission areas seemed to confirm this view .",
    "the cause of accretion anisotropy over the surface of a low b - field ns has been purported to be the `` propeller effect '' @xcite , in which at low accretion rates , the magnetic field increases in importance relative to the gravitational field in determining the accretion geometry , perhaps expelling much of the accretion from the system when the effect of the magnetic field is comparable to or stronger than that of the gravitational field at the radius where the keplerian frequency is equal to the spin frequency of the ns .",
    "when this occurs , some fraction of the accretion may follow the magnetic field lines to the magnetic poles which , if these are offset from the rotational poles , could conceivably produce x - ray pulsations .",
    "the efficiency of such a propeller has been estimated recently @xcite .",
    "however , some observations of decreasing torque with increasing luminosity may indicate deviations from this standard magnetic accretion scenario in low mass x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "if , after an outburst , accretion continues into quiescence then pulsations might be expected , particularly if the ns can be shown to have gone through a `` propeller phase '' , in which the accretion geometry in the vicinity of the ns is dominated by the magnetic field , rather than by the gravitational field .",
    "no pulsations from these objects in quiescence have yet been reported , although they have been searched for @xcite .",
    "thus , until recently , the view of the quiescent luminosity of low - b transient nss has been as due to continued accretion over a fraction of the surface of the ns , perhaps caused by modified accretion geometry due to the effects of the magnetic field , which may therefore give rise to pulsations in the x - ray intensity .",
    "a different view of the origin of the quiescent luminosity has recently been described @xcite , in which nuclear reactions at the base of the ns crust keep the ns core heated to temperatures ( @xmath3 ) sufficient to explain a large fraction , if not all , of the quiescent luminosity of these objects ( ) ; in this manner , the quiescent luminosity can be produced in the absence of active accretion .",
    "the discrepancy in the emission area can be explained as due to an incorrect blackbody assumption  specifically , if accretion is shut - off , metals stratify in the ns atmosphere @xcite , producing a pure h photosphere , in which the free - free opacity , which decreases with increasing frequency , dominates , permitting higher e photons to originate at greater depth , thus at higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "this produces an emergent spectrum which is spectrally harder than a simple blackbody , and  when described as a simple blackbody  requires a higher @xmath4 , and subsequently lower emission area , to parameterize it .",
    "spectral fits with h atmosphere spectra show that the observed x - ray spectra from the three such objects for which data exists ( cen  x-4 , aql  x-1 , and 4u  1608 - 522 ) imply emission areas consistent with a 10 km ns @xcite . thus , both their quiescent luminosities and their emergent x - ray spectra can be explained in this manner , without invoking active accretion during quiescence .",
    "an attractive feature of this explanation is that it accounts for the similar luminosities of these three objects , without requiring their quiescent mass accretion rates ( a product of the propeller efficiency and mass accretion rate through the accretion disk ) to be serendipitously similar .",
    "it remains an open question if accretion ( at a level of @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7   yr@xmath8 ) occurs at all , contributing some fraction of the quiescent x - ray luminosity .",
    "there are few observational means by which this may be investigated .",
    "one such possibility is to search for metal lines in the quiescent x - ray spectrum , which , if present , would imply that metals are being fed into the atmosphere at a rate greater than gravity can stratify it ( bildsten92 , see zavlin96 for x - ray spectra of metallic atmospheres ) .",
    "such spectra can be investigated by the latest generation of x - ray spectroscopy missions ( _ axaf _  and _ xmm _ ) .",
    "a second method is to search for intensity variability during quiescence . in particular , as described above , if pulsational variability at a particular frequency were to be found in quiescence , this would support the scenario of active accretion along the magnetic field lines to the ns surface . alternatively , if the ns magnetic field were strong enough to significantly affect the photospheric opacity ( @xmath9  g ; cf .",
    "zavlin95 ) , this would produce apparent `` hot spots '' near the magnetic poles of the ns which , if offset from the rotation axis , could give rise to pulsations ; however , it is thought that type - i x - ray bursting sources have magnetic fields below this value .",
    "clearly discovery of pulsations or constraints on the pulsed fraction during x - ray quiescence ( following the onset of a `` propeller '' ) would provide useful limits for models of quiescent ns emission .",
    "the system aql  x-1  lends itself to such a search for pulsations . during the x - ray decline of a recent outburst , the intensity at first decreased by one order of magnitude over 17 days , then abruptly ( beginning at @xmath10 ) by 3 orders of magnitude over 3 days , which was coupled with the sudden spectral hardening of the x - ray intensity @xcite",
    "the x - ray intensity stopped dropping at a luminosity @xmath11 , comparable to the quiescent luminosity observed previously @xcite .",
    "this was interpreted as evidence for a propeller - phase , though this remains to be confirmed through repeated observations of aql  x-1  in outburst .",
    "if indeed this behavior does indicate a propeller phase in aql  x-1 , it offers the opportunity to search for pulsations during the period when the ns magnetic field substantially alters the accretion geometry .",
    "here we have searched for , and not found , pulsations in aql  x-1   during and immediately following its supposed propeller phase . in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , we describe our search method and the results of our analysis . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] we discuss these results and our conclusions .",
    "we used high time resolution data taken with _",
    "rxte_/pca @xcite .",
    "the pca detectors have a total geometric area of 6500 @xmath12 , and a nominal energy range of 2 - 60 kev .",
    "we selected for analysis four observations , based on the results of zhang98b .",
    "these were listed by zhang et  al .",
    "as observations  8 , 10 , 11 , plus a later observation , 12 , which was not analyzed by zhang due to the faintness of the source  which made their spectral analysis infeasible , but can still be useful in our search for pulsations . based on zhang s results , the beginning of the propeller - phase appears to be between observations  9 and 10 , and so our timing analyses of observations  10 - 12 are expected to reveal pulsations created by the magnetic - field modified accretion geometry ( if any ) , while observation  8 is included simply for comparison purposes while the source was moderately brighter .",
    "we list details of the observations in table  [ tab : observations ] .",
    "data were obtained from the xte archive at heasarc .    for our data analysis , we used the standard ftools / xte v4.0 . using standard-2 formatted data , we extracted the x - ray spectrum from each observation and subtracted background counts ( estimated using pcabackest tool ) , and examined the counts spectra . based on the spectrum of the faintest observation ( number 12 ) , which becomes background dominated above @xmath13 , we selected for our analysis pha bins 0 - 20 , corresponding in energy roughly to 2 - 12 kev .",
    "we then extracted individual photon events from data in e125 mode ( which has time resolution of @xmath14 ) , and corrected the photon arrival times ( time of arrival ; toas ) to the solar system barycenter .",
    "zhang98b reported strong evidence for a @xmath15 pulsation frequency , observed during @xmath16 following a type - i x - ray burst from aql  x-1 .",
    "( it is possible that this may be the second harmonic of the ns spin frequency . )",
    "similar pulsations have been observed from type - i bursts of 5 other sources ( 1728 - 34 , strohmayer96 ; 1636 - 53 , zhang96 ; 1731 - 260 , smith97 ; a galactic center source , possibly mxb 1743 - 29 , strohmayer97 ; and 1702 - 43 , markwardt99 ) . rather than restrict our efforts to a small range of frequencies around the previously measured value , we chose to do a more general search for pulsations over the broad frequency range @xmath17 .",
    "this range includes all previously reported rotation frequencies for type - i x - ray bursters .",
    "we were able to do this more general search without a significant loss of sensitivity for reasons which we explain below , in section [ sec : sensitivity ] .",
    "the aql  x-1  system consists of a ns and a companion star , both orbiting the system s center of mass with a period of about 19 hours ( see section  [ sec : phasespace ] below ) . as a result of this orbital motion , the ns is accelerating along our line of sight .",
    "any pulsations will therefore be observed with a doppler shifted frequency which is not constant in time . in a standard fast fourier transform ( fft )",
    "analysis , the spectral power resulting from such a signal may be spread out over many frequency bins , drastically decreasing the probability of detection . for example , consider a 550 hz pulsar in a 19 hour circular orbit with a maximum projected velocity of 100 .",
    "if we calculate a coherent power spectrum using @xmath18 seconds of data , the power from this pulsar will be spread over as many as 70 independent frequency bins ( for the worst case orbital phase , the observed pulsar frequency covers a range @xmath19 , giving @xmath20  bins ) . to counteract this effect , we attempt to remove the acceleration of the pulsar signal in the time domain before performing the fft . because we do not have complete knowledge of aql  x-1 s orbital parameters",
    ", we must cover the possible orbital parameter space with a number of acceleration trials and repeat the fourier analysis for each .    for our purposes , the orbit ( assumed circular )",
    "can be characterized by three independent parameters  the orbital period @xmath21 , the projected circular velocity @xmath22 , and the orbital phase @xmath23 of the ns at the start of the observation in question .",
    "the projected circular velocity is the magnitude of the ns s circular velocity projected along our line of sight , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the plane of the orbit .",
    "note that we could equally well have chosen the projected orbital radius ( @xmath26 ) in lieu of this parameter .",
    "the orbital phase @xmath23 is measured in cycles , and is therefore in the range @xmath27 $ ] , with @xmath28 corresponding to @xmath29 ( where the observed pulsar frequency would be measured at its minimum ) .",
    "the signal from a pulsar in such an orbit would be observed with a doppler shifted frequency @xmath30\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the rest frequency of the pulsar , @xmath32 is the speed of light , and @xmath33 is the elapsed time since phase @xmath23 .",
    "pulsar orbital acceleration searches are typically carried out ( see , for example , anderson90 ) by correcting data with an assumed constant acceleration @xmath34 .",
    "this is applicable when the data cover only a small part of the pulsar s orbit , or the pulsar is very strong . in the first case ,",
    "the short span of orbit is well approximated by a constant acceleration , while in the second case , some spreading of the feature in the power spectrum can be tolerated without the signal disappearing into the noise .",
    "for the aql  x-1  searches reported here , we assumed that neither of these conditions was satisfied .",
    "our acceleration searches therefore fully correct for an assumed circular orbit @xmath35 .",
    "as compared with the constant acceleration method , this circular acceleration method may require more trial accelerations to cover a given orbital phase space , but the detection significance is greatly increased .",
    "this is because the circular method recovers significantly more signal power in a single power spectrum bin , more than making up for the increased number of trials ( the detection significance is exponential in recovered power , but only linear in the number of trials ) .    after preparing an energy selected , barycentered photon toa list , we proceeded with the search method as follows .",
    "first , we assumed particular values for the orbital parameters ( i.e. , a trial acceleration ) from within the search phase space ( of orbital period , velocity , and initial phase ; see table  [ tab : phasespace ] ) .",
    "we corrected the toas for the assumed acceleration by introducing a corrected time @xmath36 , which is a function of the original time @xmath33 , such that the frequency as a function of @xmath36 is constant .",
    "equivalently , we require the integrated phase to be linear in @xmath36 : @xmath37 integrating equation  ( [ eq : doppler ] ) for a given acceleration trial @xmath38 , we see that the @xmath39 toa @xmath40 is corrected to : @xmath41\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "these corrected toas were used to construct a time series which was then ffted and used to produce an estimate of the power density spectrum ( pds ) .",
    "the pds was searched for candidates ( frequency bins containing statistically significant excess power ) .",
    "the process was repeated for each acceleration trial .",
    "the spacing of acceleration trials in ( orbital period , velocity , and phase)-parameter space was chosen to allow sensitivity to as weak a signal as possible while keeping the computational requirements reasonable .",
    "similar , but inconsistent , values for the orbital period of aql  x-1   have been published by two groups . based on observations of aql  x-1  during outburst",
    ", chevalier91 measured the orbital period to be @xmath44 .",
    "shahbaz98 determined the orbital period in quiescence to be @xmath45 . in a more recent analysis , chevalier98 report the period to be @xmath46 , again measured during outburst , but they also report a quiescent period within @xmath47 of this value . to be safe , we chose to cover a range of orbital periods that encompasses a @xmath48 range in all of these measurements ( as well as the periods in between ) : @xmath49 fortunately , we were able to cover this entire range with one trial value of @xmath21 ( see section  [ sec : searches ] below )",
    ".    the projected circular velocity @xmath22 has not been measured .",
    "we can determine an upper limit on @xmath22 for our search by assuming a value for the ns mass , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , and choosing a maximum companion mass to which we will be sensitive .",
    "we can then use our knowledge of the orbital period to calculate the orbital velocity of the ns .",
    "recently , the true optical counterpart of aql  x-1  has been identified as a late k type star @xcite .",
    "again , to be safe we decided to cover a range of velocities corresponding to a companion star mass as high as @xmath52 ( for all possible orbital inclination angles ) .",
    "this results in a search range of @xmath53 note that our search was also sensitive to larger companion masses in a restricted range of inclination angles ; e.g.   our search covered companion masses up to @xmath54 for @xmath55 .    for the starting orbital phase for each observation , rather than rely on a particular ephemeris , we simply chose to search the full range @xmath56 our search phase space is summarized in table  [ tab : phasespace ] .",
    "the _ rxte _",
    "observations included in this analysis were roughly 9 - 13 kiloseconds in duration .",
    "the toa data in each observation are broken up into two or three cohesive sections , separated by gaps due to earth occultations .",
    "each continuous section is at least 2048 seconds long , and we chose to study these continuous blocks individually .",
    "observation  10 , with one occultation drop - out , is therefore divided into two sections , which we call observations  10a and 10b .",
    "observations  11 and 12 are similarly divided ( into 11a , 11b , 11c , 12a , and 12b ) . we analyzed only the first section of observation  8 , for a total of eight separate data sets .",
    "the photons from a given data set were binned into a @xmath57  point time series , with a time resolution of @xmath58 . over the course of the observations , the source count rate decreases from about 670  at the beginning of observation  8 to less than 10  by the end of observation  12 , with a background rate of about 31 - 37",
    "( see table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "our search method was described above in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "we now describe in detail the method used to determine the grid of trial values for the orbital parameters .",
    "since we must discretize a continuous phase space , there will likely be some offset between a signal s actual parameters and our nearest trial values .",
    "the effect of this offset will be some spreading out of the signal power in the power spectrum , since the time dependence of the signal s frequency will not have been completely removed . in choosing the orbital trials ,",
    "the general idea was to space them just finely enough to keep the remaining frequency drift within tolerable limits ( to be quantified below ) .",
    "we began analytically , and then made some empirical adjustments . considering each of the three orbital parameters ( @xmath59 ) separately",
    ", we took partial derivatives of equation  ( [ eq : doppler ] ) , to determine the frequency drift that results from offsets in the individual parameters .",
    "for example , an error in the velocity ( @xmath60 ) causes a drift of @xmath61 we are interested only in the extrema of the frequency range covered by the signal over the course of the observation time @xmath4 , and for simplicity , we chose to make our velocity trial values independent of the other parameters .",
    "we therefore replace the cosine factor in equation  ( [ eq : partial_v ] ) by its maximum change over the course of an observation ( @xmath62 ) , and we replace @xmath31 by our maximum search frequency ( @xmath63 ) . the maximum frequency drift caused by a velocity offset is therefore @xmath64 a `` tolerable '' drift must be no greater than the independent frequency resolution of the power spectrum , @xmath65 . since we are considering each orbital parameter separately , for these initial calculations we restrict the error - induced drift from each to @xmath66 .",
    "this is somewhat arbitrary , and the actual spacings used were decided on with the help of simulations .",
    "note that the allowable spacing of the trials can be twice the maximum allowable offset .",
    "we now have for the velocity trial spacing @xmath67 for a coherent fft of 2048 seconds of data , the independent fourier resolution is @xmath68 .",
    "the search strategy that we settled on actually used a larger frequency resolution ( see below ) ; for now we will leave the expressions for the trial spacings in terms of @xmath65 explicitly .",
    "again , for simplicity , we chose to keep the spacing of the @xmath21 and @xmath23 trials independent of @xmath21 and @xmath23 , but we did allow for velocity dependence .",
    "for the orbital period , we ultimately find @xmath69 even for the smallest fourier resolution ( @xmath70 ) and the largest velocity in our search range ( @xmath71 ) , the orbital period trial spacing turns out to be larger than our target search range of @xmath72 . in other words ,",
    "a single trial value was sufficient to cover our entire search range in @xmath21 .",
    "thus , _ we did not actually search over trial values of the orbital period .",
    "_ for the initial orbital phase trial spacing , we find @xmath73",
    "if we were to use these spacings with coherent 2048 second ffts , each of the eight data sets would require over 95000 trial accelerations .",
    "this would require @xmath74 days of cpu time on a sun ultra 10 workstation . to reduce the computational requirements , we chose to utilize incoherently stacked power spectra .",
    "the original data of duration @xmath4 are divided into @xmath75 sections of duration @xmath76 .",
    "each section is ffted individually and the @xmath75 individual power spectra are ( incoherently ) added together .",
    "the independent fourier step size has been increased by a factor of @xmath75 ( @xmath77 ) and the trial parameter spacings increase by the same factor .",
    "the total number of trials is therefore reduced by a factor of @xmath78 ( since we are searching over two parameters ) .",
    "the reduction in the number of trials comes at the cost of reduced sensitivity , so the number of stacks @xmath75 should be kept as small as possible , just barely bringing the number of trials to a feasible level . for our analyses , we chose to use @xmath79 .    with the above analytical calculations as guides , we used simulations to determine the trial spacings actually used in the search .",
    "our simulations upheld the decision to use a single @xmath21 trial .",
    "since there are indications that the orbital period is more likely to lie towards the lower end of our search range ( @xmath80 hr ) , we chose to use @xmath81 in our trials .",
    "we decided to use a velocity trial spacing of @xmath82 this is about @xmath83 finer than the spacing calculated above ( recall that we are using @xmath79 stacks ) . for the orbital phase , we decided on a trial spacing of @xmath84 which is about @xmath85 coarser than the spacing indicated in the analytical calculation . for small velocities",
    ", we used a minimum of 16 @xmath23 trials ( except for the single @xmath86 trial ) .    using these spacings with @xmath87 oversampled power spectra ( exactly like our actual searches ) , we determined that at least @xmath88 of the time , we were able to recover at least @xmath89 of a simulated signal s power in a single spectral bin , even in the least favorable regions of our search phase space .",
    "we simulated signals whose orbital parameters were offset from our search trials and whose pulsation frequencies were offset from our discrete fourier frequencies .",
    "the reduction in recovered signal power is due to a combination of these factors .",
    "( note that it is mere coincidence that a simple fft recovers , on average , @xmath89 of a signal s power based solely on offset from the discrete fourier frequencies . in a @xmath87 oversampled spectrum , the _ minimum _ power recovered , based solely on frequency offset , is @xmath90 . )",
    "our peak detected power was not always in the frequency bin closest to the rest frequency of the simulated pulsar .",
    "this has no effect on the detection of pulsations ; the true frequency and orbit of the pulsar can be refined after the initial detection .    in total , we covered the orbital phase space with 4069 acceleration trials .",
    "the same accelerations were used for each of the eight data sets .      to characterize the sensitivity of our search",
    ", we wish to place quantitative limits on the minimum signal strength required for a significant detection .",
    "since the noise statistics of our power spectra are well understood , it is a simple matter to determine the detection threshold , the minimum spectral power @xmath91 required for a detection .",
    "this information can be used to determine the minimum required signal strength . for a review of detection thresholds , detection sensitivities , and upper limits ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "our stacked power spectra were constructed by summing four individual spectra , each normalized to a mean power of one ( note that this convention differs from the commonly used leahy normalization @xcite , for which the mean noise power is two ) . in the absence of a signal ,",

    "instead we consider the worst case scenario covered by our search parameter space .",
    "due to the discrete binning of photons in the construction of the time series , the recovered signal power in the fft falls off with increasing frequency .",
    "a signal near our maximum search frequency  @xmath101 , which is half the nyquist frequency of our power spectra  will produce @xmath90 of the power that would be recovered from a low frequency signal of the same intrinsic strength . also , due to our discrete grid of acceleration trials and frequency trials , we are only @xmath88 likely to recover more than @xmath89 of a signal s available power .",

    "since our search was for a similar pulsar , with @xmath144  few hundred hz frequency in a @xmath144  few hour orbit about a low - mass companion , sax  j1808.4 - 3658   provides a useful test of our acceleration method .",
    "we analyzed an _ rxte_/pca observation ( observation # 30411 - 01 - 01 - 04 ) .",
    "we selected energy pha bins corresponding to 0.4 - 17 kev from data of the same type we use in our search ( e125 ) .",
    "we barycenter corrected the arrival times with the position given by @xcite , and used 2048 seconds of data beginning at mission elapsed time ( met , seconds since 1994.0 ) 135395082 .",
    "the pulsations in these data are easily detected  the @xmath145  hz signal is obvious in an unaccelerated pds , with significant power detected in each of about 30 adjacent frequency bins , using 2048 seconds of data ( figure  [ fig:1808 ] , dotted line ) .",
    "the highest single bin power represents about @xmath146 of the total signal power in the extended feature .    using the known orbital parameters @xcite to remove the acceleration from the data , the spreading of the signal power",
    "is reduced to about 6 independent fourier bins around the correct rest frequency of the pulsar , 400.9752106(8 )  hz , with @xmath147 of the total power in a single spectral bin ( figure  [ fig:1808 ] , solid line ) .",
    "oversampling reveals that the spreading that remains is consistent with the expected sinc - function response of the ( discrete ) fft to a signal with the pulsar s rest frequency @xcite .",
    "thus , we confirm that our technique successfully removes the effect of the doppler shift due to the pulsar s orbital motion .",
    "no candidate pulsations from any of the aql  x-1  observations exceeded our predetermined detection threshold .",
    "using our largest detected search power , we can calculate upper limits on the strength of any pulsar signal contained in the various data sets searched @xcite , provided its orbit and spin frequency are covered by our search phase space .",
    "these upper limits are more restrictive than the _ a priori _ detection sensitivities .",
    "the upper limit calculation is essentially the same as the detection sensitivity calculation , with the detection threshold power @xmath91 replaced by the maximum observed power @xmath148 .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "for example , with @xmath121 confidence , we can say that there is no sinusoidal pulsar signal in observation  10a with a fractional rms amplitude greater than @xmath142 .",
    "the limits we can place on the fractional rms become less stringent as the source flux decreases , increasing to an upper limit of @xmath1 during observation  12b , when aql  x-1  was observed to be faintest ( @xmath1441  mcrab ; @xmath149 pca=1 crab ) .",
    "we find no evidence of pulsations from aql  x-1  as it fades into quiescence . the upper limits on the pulsed fraction for the eight data sets searched range from @xmath0 to @xmath1 rms .",
    "if , indeed , during the period identified as the `` propeller phase '' @xcite the ns magnetic field significantly modifies the accretion flow geometry in the vicinity of the ns , the apparent absence of pulsations does not support the hypothesis that the quiescent emission is due to continued accretion .",
    "our results can not completely rule out such accretion , however , since it is possible that the geometry of the system may not lead to detectable pulsations ; for example , the magnetic axis may be very nearly aligned with the rotation axis , or the rotation axis may point directly towards the earth .",
    "the non - detection of pulsations coupled with the observation of a thermal spectrum during quiescence @xcite favors the interpretation that the quiescent luminosity is not due to accretion , but rather to a hot ns core @xcite .",
