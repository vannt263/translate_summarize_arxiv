    "in this paper , we report an investigation of the non - equilibrium relaxation kinetics in the vortex glass phase of layered disordered type - ii superconductors . since struik s original investigations,@xcite many glassy systems have been found to exhibit physical aging phenomena , which have attracted considerable interest during the past decades.@xcite recently , it has been realized that glass - like relaxation and aging can in fact be found in many other systems.@xcite glassy materials feature extremely long relaxation times which facilitates the investigation of aging phenomena in real as well as in numerical experiments .",
    "our definition of physical aging here entails two fundamental properties : first , we require relaxation towards equilibrium to be very slow , typically characterized by a power law decay , observable in a large accessible time window @xmath0 ; here @xmath1 denotes an appropriate short microscopic time scale , whereas @xmath2 is the much larger equilibration time for the macroscopic system under consideration .",
    "second , a non - equilibrium initial state is prepared such that the kinetics is rendered non - stationary ; thus , time - translation invariance is broken , and two - time response and correlation functions depend on both times @xmath3 and @xmath4 independently , not just on the elapsed time difference @xmath5 . in this context , @xmath3 is often referred to as waiting time , and @xmath6 as observation time .",
    "in addition , in the limit @xmath7 many aging systems are characterized by the emergence of dynamical scaling behavior.@xcite    the physics of interacting vortex lines in disordered type - ii superconductors is remarkably complex and has been a major research focus in condensed matter physics in the past two decades .",
    "it has been established that the temperature vs. magnetic - field phase diagram displays a variety of distinct phases.@xcite a thorough understanding of the equilibrium and transport properties of vortex matter is clearly required to render these materials amenable to optimization with respect to dissipative losses , especially in ( desirable ) high - field applications .",
    "investigations of vortex phases and dynamics have in turn enriched condensed matter theory , specifically the mathematical modeling and description of quantum fluids , glassy states , topological defects , continuous phase transitions , and dynamic critical phenomena .",
    "an appealing feature of disordered magnetic flux line systems is their straightforward experimental realization which allows direct comparison of theoretical predictions with actual measurements .",
    "the existence of glassy phases in vortex matter is well - established theoretically and experimentally.@xcite the low - temperature abrikosov lattice in pure flux line systems is already destroyed by weak point - like disorder ( such as oxygen vacancies in the cuprates ) .",
    "the first - order vortex lattice melting transition of the pure system @xcite is then replaced by a continuous transition into a disorder - dominated vortex glass phase.@xcite here , the vortices are collectively pinned , displaying neither translational nor orientational long - range order.@xcite in addition , there is now mounting evidence for a topologically ordered dislocation - free bragg glass phase at low magnetic fields or for weak disorder;@xcite and an intriguing intermediate multidomain glass state has been proposed .",
    "@xcite    unambiguous signatures of aging in disordered vortex matter have also been identified experimentally : for example , du _ et al .",
    "_ recently demonstrated that the voltage response of a 2h - nbse@xmath8 sample to a current pulse depended on the pulse duration @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "out - of - equilibrium features of vortex glass systems relaxing towards their equilibrium state were studied some time ago by nicodemi and jensen through monte carlo simulations of a two - dimensional coarse - grained model system;@xcite however , this model applies to very thin films only since it naturally disregards the prominent three - dimensional flux line fluctuations .",
    "more recently , three - dimensional langevin dynamics simulations of vortex matter were employed by olson _",
    "_ @xcite and by bustingorry , cugliandolo , and domnguez @xcite ( see also ref .  [ ] ) in order to investigate non - equilibrium relaxation kinetics , with quite intriguing results and indications of aging behavior in quantities such as the two - time density - density correlation function , the linear susceptibility , and the mean - square displacement .",
    "rom and domnguez extended these studies to monte carlo simulations of the three - dimensional gauge glass model at the critical temperature.@xcite    we remark that it is generally crucial for the analysis of out - of - equilibrium systems to carefully investigate alternative microscopic realizations of their dynamics in order to probe their actual physical properties rather than artifacts inherent in any mathematical modeling .",
    "indeed , different mathematical and numerical representations of non - equilibrium systems rely on various underlying _ a priori _ assumptions that can only be validated _ a posteriori_. it is therefore imperative to test a variety of different numerical methods and compare the ensuing results in order to identify those properties that are generic to the physical system under investigation . in this paper",
    "we employ metropolis monte carlo simulations for a three - dimensional interacting elastic line model to investigate the relaxation behavior in the physical aging regime for systems with uncorrelated attractive point defects .",
    "we strive to employ parameter values that describe high-@xmath9 superconducting materials such as ybco , and limit our investigations to low magnetic fields and temperatures ( typically @xmath10  k ) in order for our disordered elastic line model to adequately represent a type - ii superconductor with realistic material characteristics .",
    "thus we address a parameter and time regime wherein the slow dynamics is dominated by the gradual build - up of correlations induced by an intricate interplay of repulsive vortex interactions and attractive point pinning sites .",
    "our work differs in crucial aspects from other recent studies [ ] . as in refs .",
    "[ ] , we consider the in type - ii superconductors physically relevant situation where all defects serve as genuinely attractive and localized pinning sites for vortices , in the sense that they locally reduce the chemical potential ( or equivalently , suppress the superconducting transition temperature ) .",
    "our pinning potential landscape is therefore characterized by large flat regions in space , where the vortices feel no pinning force , interspersed with small attractive potential minima of extension @xmath11 , much smaller than the london penetration depth @xmath12 that sets the vortex - vortex interaction range .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the model used in refs .",
    "[ ] , which is rather motivated by studies of interfaces in random environments that are described by gaussian distributions for the disorder strength.@xcite consequently these models inevitably incorporate both attractive and repulsive disorder , which can be viewed as mimicking a sample with a very high density of point defects .",
    "alternatively , such a coarse - grained representation of pinning centers forming a continuous disorder landscape certainly becomes appropriate at elevated temperatures near @xmath9 , since then the pinning range is set by the coherence length @xmath13 , which diverges as the critical point is approached .",
    "thus , a random medium description is best - suited for investigations of critical phenomena , and also more easily amenable to field - theory representations . at low temperatures , however , where @xmath14 , our modeling of the localized pinning centers appears more realistic , and we furthermore remark that in this scenario repulsive defects would introduce different physics in the non - equilibrium relaxation and aging kinetics of vortices in superconductors , such as flux bunching in regions devoid of such disorder .",
    "we therefore carefully exclude any repulsive pinning sites .",
    "in addition , the temperatures used in refs .",
    "[ ] appear to be considerably higher than those studied in our present work .",
    "further differences can be found in the length of the vortex lines ( in refs .",
    "[ ] rather short lines were considered ) , in the boundary conditions , as well as in the initial preparation of the system .",
    "we characterize the aging properties of the interacting and pinned flux lines through several different two - time quantities , namely the vortex density - density autocorrelation function , the flux line height - height autocorrelation function , and the transverse vortex mean - square displacement .",
    "investigating the influence of weak point defects , we find that the non - equilibrium relaxation properties of magnetic flux lines in disordered type - ii superconductors are governed by various crossover effects that reflect the competition between pinning and repulsive interactions . in the long - time limit and for not too large pinning strengths , the dynamics is manifestly similar to that observed in structural glasses .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] we describe our model and the monte carlo simulation algorithm , and define the quantities of interest for our study .",
    "our data and principal results are presented in section  [ sec3 ] . in order to disentangle the different contributions to the non - equilibrium relaxation dynamics of our system",
    ", we first separately elucidate the effects of attractive pinning centers and of long - range vortex - vortex interactions , before we endeavour to analyze and understand their intriguing interplay as reflected in the vortex system s relaxation kinetics .",
    "finally , we discuss our findings in section  [ sec4 ] , and compare them with other studies .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional vortex system in the london limit , where the london penetration depth is much larger than the coherence length .",
    "we model the vortex motion by means of an elastic flux line free energy described in ref .  [ ] , see also , e.g. , refs .",

    "the effective model hamiltonian @xmath17 is defined in terms of the flux line trajectories @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , and consists of three components , namely the elastic line tension , the repulsive vortex - vortex interaction , and the disorder - induced pinning potential : @xmath20 here , the elastic line stiffness is @xmath21 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 denoting the london penetration depth and coherence length in the crystallographic ab plane ( we assume the magnetic field along the c axis ) , and the anisotropy parameter ( effective mass ratio ) @xmath22 .",
    "the energy scale is set by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "the expression for the elastic line energy in eq .",
    "( [ hamilt ] ) is valid in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "the purely in - plane repulsive interaction potential ( consistent with the extreme london limit ) between flux line elements is given by the modified bessel function of zeroth order , @xmath26 , which diverges logarithmically as @xmath27 , and decreases exponentially for @xmath28 .",
    "these vortex interactions are truncated at half the system size , which is in turn chosen sufficiently big such that numerical artifacts due to this cut - off length are minimized .",
    "we model point pinning centers through square potential wells with radius @xmath11 and strength @xmath29 at @xmath30 defect positions .",

    "our simulation parameter values  @xcite were chosen corresponding to typical material parameters for ybco as listed in appendix d of ref .",
    "[ ] . in the following , lengths and energies are reported relative to the effective defect radius @xmath11 and interaction energy scale @xmath31 ( using cgs units ) , and time in monte carlo steps ( mcs ) , where one mcs correspond to @xmath32 proposed updates of the flux line elements , with @xmath15 the number of flux lines and @xmath16 the number of layers .",
    "we set the pinning center radius @xmath33  , anisotropy parameter @xmath34 , and , as is appropriate at low temperatures , @xmath35  , and @xmath36  .",
    "then @xmath37 ( in cgs units of energy / length ) , and the energy scale in the line tension term becomes @xmath38 .",
    "we systematically vary the pinning strength @xmath29 between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "usually , our simulations are performed at temperature @xmath41  k , which corresponds to @xmath42 .",
    "thermal excitation energies are thus small compared to the elastic and pinning energies , and at equilibrium we therefore expect the system to be deep in the glassy regime .",
    "we do not allow for flux line cutting and reconnection processes in our simulations of a low - temperature and dilute vortex system .",
    "we apply the standard metropolis monte carlo simulation algorithm in three dimensions with a discretized version of the above effective hamiltonian ( [ hamilt]).@xcite the system contains @xmath43 flux lines in @xmath16 layers , with a distance @xmath11 between consecutive layers ; and an equal number @xmath44 of point pinning centers that are however randomly distributed within the layer , with mean separation @xmath45 ; in comparison , the triangular vortex lattice spacing would be @xmath46 in our dilute system .",
    "we apply periodic boundary conditions in all three space directions , as we are mainly interested in bulk properties .",

    "aging phenomena can generally be adequately characterized through the study of two - time quantities . in our work",
    "we put special emphasis on a range of observables that allow us to rather comprehensively monitor the distinct relaxation processes in vortex matter that originate from pinning to attractive point defects and repulsive interaction forces , respectively , and their intricate competitive interplay .    the height - height autocorrelation function and",

    "we start our discussion with free flux lines , mainly in order to validate our code by comparing our data with the theoretically expected behavior and earlier work .",
    "we will then separately consider the effects of attractive point pins and of the long - range repulsive vortex interactions , before we at last venture to study the interplay of these two competing mechanisms to induce or relax correlations in the system .",
    "the relaxation kinetics of a single free elastic vortex line constitutes a valuable benchmark to check our program as this case can be easily understood by recalling that in the presence of thermal noise a fluctuating interface that tries to minimize its line tension should be described in the continuum limit by the linear edwards ",

    "the edwards  wilkinson equation , as well as a range of microscopic models belonging to the same dynamic universality class , has been studied extensively .",

    "data obtained for different waiting times are shown . for @xmath102 layers the system rapidly reaches the steady state , and time - translation invariance",

    "the dashed lines in ( d ) and ( f ) indicate the predicted asymptotic power laws with exponents @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively . here and in the following figures error bars are much smaller than the symbol sizes . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we display our monte carlo simulation results for our elastic vortex line model when both the vortex interaction and the defect pinning are switched off , i.e. , only the first contribution in ( [ hamilt ] ) is retained .",
    "one immediately notices a striking difference between the behavior of a `` thin film '' composed of only a few layers ( such as @xmath102 , see figs .",
    "[ fig3]a[fig3]c ) and `` bulk '' systems consisting of many layers ( @xmath100 , see figs .  [ fig3]d[fig3]f ) . in the former case",
    ", the system rapidly evolves into the steady - state regime , yielding two - time quantities that only depend on the elapsed time difference @xmath103 . as a result ,",
    "the transverse displacements in the @xmath58 and @xmath59 directions perform simple random walks , as is revealed by the linear increase of the mean - square displacement with time , see fig .",
    "[ fig3]a . for the larger bulk system ,",
    "the correlated regime persists throughout the duration of our simulations , and both waiting and observation times reside well within that extended intermediate regime .",
    "this gives rise to aging and dynamical scaling : time - translation invariance is broken , and all the two - time quantities display full - aging scaling.@xcite for each two - time observable we find the following scaling behavior ( here given for the height autocorrelation function @xmath55 ) : @xmath106 where @xmath107 represents an aging scaling exponent and @xmath108 denotes an associated scaling function that follows a power law decay for large arguments .",
    "for the height - height autocorrelation we have @xmath109.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig3]e we explicitly compare our numerically determined scaling function with the expression ( [ eq : corr_ew ] ) resulting from the direct solution of the edwards  wilkinson equation ( full line ) , and obtain perfect agreement .    summarizing , we see that the free vortex line fluctuations are indeed aptly described by the one - dimensional edwards  wilkinson equation ( [ eq : ew ] ) .",
    "we also observe a strong dependence on the system s extension @xmath16 in the magnetic field direction , i.e. , the vortex length : on the time scale of our simulations , the stationary regime is almost immediately reached when the system consists of only a few layers ; in contrast , for larger bulk systems aging and dynamical scaling are observed easily .",
    "this points to quite distinct relaxation behavior in thin superconducting films and thicker bulk samples .",
    "we decided to avoid the additional complications stemming from the crossover between the correlated and steady - state regimes in our present study , and to rather focus on system sizes sufficiently large that no finite - size effects ( no crossover to the steady state ) are observed on the accessed time scales .",
    "properties of smaller systems and possible experimental consequences for thin superconducting films will be discussed in a separate publication .",
    "intuitively , one anticipates pinning centers to strongly influence the thermal fluctuations of our elastic flux lines .",
    "indeed , attractive forces emanating from the pinning centers will tend to localize vortex segments , and thus ultimately suppress thermal fluctuations . depending on the pinning strength",
    ", flux line elements will end up spending an appreciable amount of time close to a pinning center .",
    "therefore , compared to freely fluctuating lines , a marked _ increase _ of correlations as function of time must be expected .",
    "before we proceed to analyze the influence of pinning centers in more detail , we need to stress that we exclusively consider attractive point defects , in accordance with the physics of disordered type - ii superconductors in the low - temperature regime . a recent study [ ] addressed the relaxation and aging properties of elastic lines subjected to a random potential , corresponding to both attractive and repulsive pinning centers .",
    "whereas a gaussian disorder strength distribution certainly is a good model for disordered ferromagnets , its relevance for relaxation processes in disordered type - ii superconductors at low temperatures is less obvious .     vs. time @xmath6 ( in mcs ) for different values of the pinning strength @xmath110 , for systems of size @xmath111 .",
    "in the initial time regime , the pinning centers attract the vortex segments as revealed by an increase of the slope of @xmath112 as compared to a pure system . at later times the localization of the flux line elements induced by the pinning yields a strong decrease of this slope .",
    "the data shown result from averaging over typically 100 independent runs .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the times @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 mcs , see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] below . ]",
    "let us start by looking at the mean - square displacement @xmath112 , with @xmath117 , which gives a measure of the ( squared ) distance traveled by the flux line elements since the initial preparation of the system . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we compare the behavior of a free elastic line with that of flux lines subject to pinning centers of various strengths @xmath118 .",
    "the presence of attractive pins clearly gives rise to different regimes .",
    "the flux lines are rapidly attracted by the point defects , which yields an increase of the slope in the log - log plots of @xmath112 vs. time @xmath6 .",
    "this continues until some pinning strength - dependent crossover time at which the slope decreases even below the value of the free line , signifying the confinement of localized vortex segments to the vicinity of the pins .",
    "as one would expect , this crossover time decreases for increasing pinning strengths .",
    "for @xmath119 , @xmath112 remains essentially unchanged , which indicates that for non - interacting lines there exists a critical pinning strength above which thermal fluctuations are no longer sufficiently strong to allow the vortex line elements to escape from the defects .",
    "these different regimes also manifest themselves when two - time quantities are considered , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where we have plotted the data according to the free - line scaling behavior .",
    "of course , it is not to be expected that these scaling laws remain valid when attractive defects are added to the system , but this representation of our data facilitates the following discussion .",
    "we first remark , see figs .",
    "[ fig5]a and [ fig5]d , that the change of the slope of @xmath112 translates into deviations of the mean - square displacement @xmath120 from the free - line scaling that can be readily understood .",
    "for example , for @xmath121 the time intervals @xmath122 $ ] , @xmath123 $ ] , and @xmath124 $ ] , used to compute @xmath120 for the waiting times @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath114 , respectively , correspond to the time regime with increasing local slopes of @xmath112 , compare fig .",
    "this yields a shift of @xmath127 to higher values .",
    "as the crossover time of @xmath112 lies inside the interval @xmath128 $ ] , the converse behavior is observed for @xmath129 and even larger waiting times , with a shift of @xmath127 to lower values .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for larger pinning strengths , since then the crossover of @xmath112 takes place earlier .     and ( d - f ) @xmath130 : ( a ) and ( d ) mean - square displacement ; ( b ) and ( e ) height - height autocorrelation function ; ( c ) and ( f ) vortex density - density autocorrelation ( with @xmath101 ) .",
    "the shown data result from averaging over typically 100 independent runs in systems of size @xmath131 . for direct comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the data are plotted according to the scaling properties of free elastic lines . whereas an approximate scaling prevails for small waiting times ( especially for the mean - square displacement and the vortex density - density autocorrelation ) , strong deviations emerge for larger waiting times . in ( e ) the apparent collapse of the height autocorrelation function for the largest waiting times is merely caused by the scale used in that figure . ]",
    "the strongest influence of point defects and largest deviations from free elastic lines are observed in the height autocorrelation function , figs .",
    "[ fig5]b and [ fig5]e . as the flux line elements are trapped by the pinning centers , their transverse in - plane displacements",
    "become diminished , which leads to an increase of the correlations as a function of waiting time .",
    "in addition , the decay of @xmath55 as a function of @xmath6 is much slower for larger values of @xmath3 . for larger pinning strengths and long waiting times",
    "we even observe non - monotonic temporal evolution , as the trapped flux lines experience an increase of the height correlations .",
    "finally , the vortex density - density autocorrelation turns out to be the least sensitive among our two - time observables to the presence of pinning centers , at least for comparatively small waiting times , see figs .",
    "[ fig5]c and [ fig5]f .",
    "indeed , for moderate values of @xmath3 one still observes the free - line scaling behavior ; this is of course a consequence of our prescription for the computation of this correlation function , namely setting a circular area with fixed radius around every vortex line element at time @xmath3 : as long as only a few line elements are captured by a point defect , the scaling of @xmath132 remains approximately unchanged . only when the majority of the vortex segments become trapped , does this localization induce a strong enhancement of the vortex density - density correlations .",
    "the shown data result from averaging over typically 100 independent runs in systems of size @xmath133 .",
    "the data display simple aging scaling , with different exponents for the two quantities . ]    to conclude this section , we note that the non - equilibrium relaxation physics is drastically different when both attractive and repulsive pinning centers are implemented .",
    "as studied in ref .",
    "[ ] ( see also refs .  [ ] ) an elastic line in a random potential is characterized by a time - dependent correlation length that crosses over from an early time power law growth to an asymptotic logarithmic growth .",
    "consequently , two - time quantities display an apparent simple aging scaling with effective exponents that depend on temperature and on the randomness .",
    "we have verified that we obtain similar results as in ref .",

    "these crossover features also capture most of the relevant properties of disordered ferromagnets undergoing phase ordering.@xcite in refs .",
    "[ ] , disordered type - ii superconductors in the low - temperature phase were modeled by a corresponding model with random pins that are either attractive or repulsive .",
    "however , the physical realization relevant to materials is that of purely attractive pins , similar to those studied in our present work . yet since the properties of elastic lines strongly depend on the nature of the pinning centers , any conclusions regarding the non - equilibrium relaxation properties of disordered type - ii superconductors at low temperatures that are inferred from models with both attractive and repulsive defects should be viewed with some scepticism .       vs. time @xmath6 ( in mcs ) for interacting vortex lines with different values of the pinning strength @xmath110 ( system size @xmath134 ; the data result from averaging over typically 100 independent runs ) .",
    "due to the long - range interactions , the flux lines aim to maximize their separations , thus yielding values of @xmath112 that are two orders of magnitude larger than in the absence of repulsive forces , compare fig .",
    "these displacements are impeded and vortex motion eventually stopped by the caging constraints of neighboring lines and pinning to attractive point defects .",
    "the ( red ) dashed line displays our data for a pure system , in the absence of pinning centers .",

    "the ensuing dynamic regimes are again nicely captured by the mean - square displacement @xmath112 which takes on values that are two orders of magnitude larger than in the absence of interactions , see the ( red ) dashed line in fig .",
    "while the flux line segments experience these large displacements , @xmath112 displays an approximate power law increase with time , with an effective exponent of @xmath135 . once the majority of vortices have reached the vicinity of their final equilibrium positions , the slope of @xmath112 starts to gradually decrease .    ) .",

( a ) , ( c ) , and ( e ) display the unscaled data in a log - log plot , whereas ( b ) , ( d ) , and ( f ) show the approximate scaling observed for not too large waiting times .",
    "this scaling regime corresponds to the intermediate time window where @xmath112 exhibits a power law increase as a function of time , with an ( effective ) exponent @xmath135 , see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . ]",
    "the two - time quantities reveal both the initial - time regime as well as the crossover at later times , see fig .",
    "the mean - square displacement @xmath120 yields a reasonably good data collapse for the smaller waiting times with the scaling exponent @xmath136 that follows from the slope of @xmath112 in that regime .",
    "when the observation time @xmath6 exceeds the crossover time , this scaling breaks down .",
    "instead the growth rate of @xmath120 decreases strongly with increasing @xmath3 , even resulting in a crossing of the curves for different waiting times .",
    "the behavior of @xmath120 is mirrored by that of the vortex density autocorrelation function : for small waiting times @xmath3 , scaling is achieved with exponent @xmath137 , whereas for larger waiting times the decay of the correlation slows down as @xmath3 increases . from these results",
    "we infer that the vortex density - density autocorrelation contains essentially the same physical information as the mean - square displacement .",
    "interestingly , the height - height autocorrelation function displays a different scaling for smaller waiting times , given by the scaling exponent @xmath138 of the free line , see figs .",
    "[ fig8]c and [ fig8]d .",
    "this means that during the initial rearrangement of the vortex lines the height fluctuations are essentially the same as for the free line .",
    "only when the vortices come close to their equilibrium positions does the character of the correlations change , reflecting the presence of long - range repulsive forces .",
    "we are now ready to study the combined effects of repulsive flux line interactions and point defect pinning during the non - equilibrium relaxation of vortex matter in disordered type - ii superconductors .",
    "we again begin by first considering the mean - square displacement @xmath112 , see fig .",
    "adding very weak attractive defects , e.g. , with @xmath121 , has only a very minor effect on the time evolution of @xmath112 .",
    "strengthening the point pins leads to a smaller rate of increase for the mean - square displacement , see the curve for @xmath139 . at early times",
    "the flux lines are still displaced from their initial positions , as the vortex interactions try to establish an abrikosov lattice . however , at intermediate times these displacements are impeded by the defects that noticeably slow down vortex motion . as a result",
    "the system tends to a new ( quasi-)equilibrium state that balances these two competing mechanisms . for even stronger",
    "pinning , the moving flux lines become rapidly trapped by the disorder and the system gradually freezes into a blocked configuration . in fig .",

    "the pinning strength here is @xmath130 , the system size @xmath131 , and the data result from averaging over typically 800 independent simulation runs .",
    "the waiting times @xmath3 for the vortex density autocorrelation are the same as those for the mean - square displacement . for the height autocorrelation function ,",
    "the waiting times range from @xmath142 to @xmath53 , the values of @xmath3 being doubled between consecutive curves .",
    "the ( normalized ) height - height autocorrelation function , after a crossover , displays the same qualitative behavior as that encountered in structural glasses . for large values of @xmath5 ,",
    "the height autocorrelation assumes the stretched exponential form ( [ eq : str_exp ] ) with @xmath143 , as shown by the dashed line overlying the @xmath53 data . ]",
    "the most interesting scenario naturally emerges for intermediate defect strengths .",
    "indeed , when the pins are very weak , the rearrangement of the flux lines is barely affected , and all studied two - time quantities quantitatively display the same behavior as in a pure system . on the other hand , when the defects are too strong , the flux line elements remain firmly attached to the pinning centers , and a frozen configuration ensues .",
    "the non - trivial behavior at intermediate pinning strengths is studied in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for the case @xmath130 .    the data for @xmath120 and @xmath132 shown in figs .",
    "[ fig9]a and [ fig9]c are readily understood by comparing them to the corresponding results for the pure case , see figs .",
    "[ fig8]a and [ fig8]e . the difference between these data sets is the absence of the early - time regime where @xmath112 has an approximately constant slope , see fig .",
    "consequently the data with @xmath130 do not allow any data collapse , not even for the smallest waiting times considered .",
    "however , this is the only noticeable difference , and the behavior for larger waiting times is qualitatively the same as for @xmath144 , except that the decrease in slope of @xmath120 for larger values of @xmath3 is stronger when @xmath145 .",
    "however , a completely different picture emerges for the evolution of the normalized height - height autocorrelation function . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9]b , for waiting times @xmath3 larger than a certain crossover value , @xmath55 exhibits the typical two - step relaxation of a structural glass : an initial time - translation invariant regime , which corresponds to the so - called @xmath146 relaxation in glasses and only depends on the elapsed time difference @xmath103 , is followed by a slow decay that is usually referred to as @xmath74 relaxation in the glass literature.@xcite in the long - time limit we can fit this slow decay to a stretched exponential @xmath147 \\",

    "we obtain a consistent value @xmath150 for the stretching exponent in eq .",
    "( [ eq : str_exp ] ) .",
    "this emergence of a characteristic two - step glass - like relaxation is very intriguing .",
    "obviously , the flux lines do not settle into a stable microstate even after their lateral displacements have become strongly reduced owing to the capture by the attractive pinning centers and the caging due to their repelling neighboring vortices . instead , as a consequence of the two competing relaxation mechanisms , collective dynamics and slow decorrelation sets in that yields the typical two - step relaxation dynamics of a glass .",
    "we also note the intriguing shape of the normalized height autocorrelation function in the crossover regime .",
    "indeed , at intermediate waiting times @xmath55 displays a strongly non - monotonic behavior , with a maximal value that even _ exceeds _ the value @xmath151 at @xmath73 .",
    "this remarkable feature points to a fundamental change in the nature of the emerging correlations , which is due to the trapping of vortex segments in the vicinity of the defects and the subsequent balancing of the competition between the attractive pinning and the repulsive interactions .",
    "our three - dimensional monte carlo investigation of relaxation processes in disordered type - ii superconductors has allowed us to gain a thorough understanding of the non - equilibrium properties of these technologically important materials .",
    "we find the relaxation processes to be dominated by the interplay of two competing interactions , namely the pinning of the flux line elements to attractive point defects and the long - range mutual repulsion of the vortices .",
    "this competition generates various crossover scenarios that we have discussed systematically .",
    "the most interesting regime emerges for pinning centers of intermediate strength , for which we observe a distinguished two - step relaxation and a final slow , stretched - exponential decay of the height - height autocorrelation function .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of that encountered in structural glasses , clearly demonstrating that disordered type - ii superconductors subject to point defects indeed display pronounced glassy behavior at low temperatures , again justifying the term `` vortex glass '' for this frustrated pinned low - temperature phase .",
    "we remark that our results are at variance with recent investigations based on three - dimensional london  langevin dynamics simulations , where standard aging and dynamical scaling behavior of two - time quantities was observed,@xcite akin to the relaxation features of elastic lines in a random medium.@xcite however , these studies , in addition to difference in sample preparation , system size , and boundary conditions in the @xmath57-direction , employed a coarse - grained continuous random medium model of disordered type - ii superconductors that becomes adequate near the normal- to superconducting transition , but does not realistically capture superconducting materials at low temperatures for which isolated defects such as oxygen vacancies always induce a local suppression of the transition temperature and therefore constitute attractive localized pinning centers for vortices .",
    "as our study shows , dynamical scaling no longer prevails for purely attractive point pinning centers , but instead much richer glassy relaxation dynamics sets in .    as already mentioned in the introduction",
    ", it is essential for investigations of non - equilibrium systems to study different dynamics and their algorithmic implementations in order to ensure that any ensuing results indeed describe actual physical properties of the system rather than numerical artifacts .",
    "we have therefore recently begun to implement corresponding london ",
    "langevin dynamics simulations for our elastic line model ( [ hamilt ] ) with exclusively attractive pinning centers.@xcite our first tentative findings are in complete agreement with the monte carlo simulation results reported in this paper : they too show the emergence of glass - like behavior , with a slow , stretched - exponential decay at long times .",
    "an in - depth analysis of this dynamics is currently in progress ; this comparative study also aims at matching the different microscopic time scales implicit in monte carlo and langevin dynamical simulations .",
    "our current study can readily be expanded in various directions .",
    "our results are valid in the regime where all time - dependent length scales remain small compared to the size of the system .",
    "however , many transport and relaxation experiments are carried out on thin superconducting films rather than bulk samples . in our model",
    ", a finite ( small ) number of layers introduces a dominant new length scale that substantially changes the relaxation processes , leading to additional crossover features .",
    "we also note that other types of defects can be experimentally realized , ranging from parallel and splayed columnar pins to planar defects , and combinations thereof with point disorder .",
    "it is an open and intriguing problem to understand how these different defect configurations influence the out - of - equilibrium relaxation processes in type - ii superconductors .",
    "a detailed understanding of the relaxation phenomena in superconducting materials may facilitate characterization and optimization of samples with respect to pinning and flux transport .",
    "finally , in all transport applications the flux lines are driven across the samples by external currents , which at long times yields a non - equilibrium steady state replacing the thermal equilibrium state that emerges without drive . following similar lines as in the present study",
