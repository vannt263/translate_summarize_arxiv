    "]    such structures , often called `` futile cycles '' ( also called substrate cycles , enzymatic cycles , or enzymatic inter - conversions , see  @xcite ) , serve as basic blocks in cellular signaling pathways and have pivotal impact on the signaling dynamics .",
    "futile cycles underlie signaling processes such as gtpase cycles @xcite , bacterial two - component systems and phosphorelays @xcite actin treadmilling @xcite ) , and glucose mobilization @xcite , as well as metabolic control @xcite and cell division and apoptosis @xcite and cell - cycle checkpoint control @xcite .",
    "one very important instance is that of mitogen - activated protein kinase ( `` mapk '' ) cascades , which regulate primary cellular activities such as proliferation , differentiation , and apoptosis  @xcite in eukaryotes from yeast to humans .",
    "mapk cascades usually consist of three tiers of similar structures with multiple feedbacks  @xcite .",
    "each individual level of the mapk cascades is a futile cycle as depicted in figure [ fig : scheme ] with @xmath3 .",

    "studied the existence of multistationarity in their paper @xcite , employing algorithms based on feinberg s chemical reaction network theory ( crnt ) .",

    "the crnt algorithm confirms multistationarity in a single level of mapk cascades , and provides a set of kinetic constants which can give rise to multistationarity .",

    ", gunawardena proposed a novel approach to the study of steady states of futile cycles .",
    "his approach , which was focused in the question of determining the proportion of maximally phosphorylated substrate , was developed under the simplifying quasi - steady state assumption that substrate is in excess .",
    "nonetheless , our study of multistationarity uses in a key manner the basic formalism in @xcite , even for the case when substrate is not in excess .    in section [ s : assumption ] , we state our basic assumptions regarding the model . the basic formalism and background for the approach",
    "is provided in section [ s : math ] .",
    "the main focus of this paper is on section [ s : bounds ] , where we derive various bounds on the number of steady states of futile cycles of size @xmath1 .",
    "the first result is a the lower bound for the number of steady states .",
    "currently available results on lower bounds , as in @xcite , can only handle the case when quasi - steady state assumptions are valid ; we substantially extend these results to the fully general case by means of a perturbation argument which allows one to get around these restricted assumptions .",
    "another novel feature of our results in this paper is the derivation of an upper bound of @xmath2 , valid for all kinetic constants .",
    "models in molecular cell biology are characterized by a high degree of uncertainly in parameters , hence such results valid over the entire parameter space are of special significance . however , when more information of the parameters are available , sharper upper bounds can obtained , see theorems [ thm : n+1 ] and [ thm:1 ] .",
    "we finally conclude our paper in section [ s : end ] with a conjecture of an @xmath0 upper bound .",
    "we remark that the results given here complement our work dealing with the _ dynamical _ behavior of futile cycles .",
    "for the case @xmath3 , @xcite showed that the model exhibits generic convergence to steady states but no more complicated behavior , at least within restricted parameter ranges , while @xcite showed a persistence property ( no species tends to be eliminated ) for any possible parameter values .",
    "these papers did not address the question of estimating the _ number _ of steady states .",
    "( an exception is the case @xmath8 , for which uniqueness of steady states can be proved in several ways , and for which global convergence to these unique equilibria holds @xcite . )",
    "before presenting mathematical details , let us first discuss the basic biochemical assumptions that go into the model . in general , phosphorylation and dephosphorylation can follow either distributive or processive mechanism . in the processive mechanism ,",
    "the kinase ( phosphatase ) facilitates two or more phosphorylations ( dephosphorylations ) before the final product is released , whereas in the distributive mechanism , the kinase ( phosphatase ) facilitates at most one phosphorylation ( dephosphorylation ) in each molecular encounter . in the case of @xmath3 , a futile cycle that follows the processive mechanism can be represented by reactions as follows : @xmath9 and the distributive mechanism can be represented by reactions : @xmath10 biological experiments have demonstrated that both dual phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in mapk are distributive , see @xcite . in their paper @xcite ,",
    "conradi _ et al .",
    "_ showed mathematically that if either phosphorylation or dephosphorylation follows a processive mechanism , the steady state will be unique , which , it is argued in @xcite , contradicts experimental observations .",
    "so , to get more interesting results , we assume that both phosphorylations and dephosphorylations in the futile cycles follow the distributive mechanism .",
    "our structure of futile cycles in figure [ fig : scheme ] also implicitly assumes a sequential instead of a random mechanism . by a sequential mechanism ,",
    "we mean that the kinase phosphorylates the substrates in a specific order , and the phosphatase works in the reversed order .",
    "this assumption dramatically reduces the number of different phospho - forms and simplifies our analysis . in a special case",
    "when the kinetic constants of each phosphorylation are the same and the kinetic constants of each dephosphorylation are the same , the random mechanism can be easily included in the sequential case .",
    "biologically , there are systems , for instance the auto - phosphorylation of fgf - receptor-1 , that have been experimentally shown to follow a sequential mechanism @xcite .    to model the reactions , we assume mass action kinetics , which is standard in mathematical modeling of molecular events in biology .",
    "in this section , we set up a mathematical framework for studying the steady states of futile cycles",
    ". let us first write down all the elementary chemical reactions in figure [ fig : scheme ] : @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 , etc .",
    ", are kinetic parameters for binding and unbinding , @xmath14 denotes the complex consisting of the enzyme @xmath6 and the substrate @xmath4 , and so forth .",
    "these reactions can be modeled by @xmath15 differential - algebraic equations according to mass action kinetics : @xmath16 together with the algebraic `` conservation equations '' : @xmath17 the variables @xmath18 stand for the concentrations of @xmath19 respectively . for each positive vector @xmath20 ( of `` kinetic constants '' ) and each positive triple @xmath21 , we have a different system @xmath22 .",
