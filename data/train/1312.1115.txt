    "from a quantum field theory point of view , gravity is an interaction mediated by a spin-2 particle , the graviton  @xcite .",
    "a long - standing issue has been whether gravitons are truly massless like the gluon , or more like a light but massive neutrino ( the latter has no gauge `` protection '' , of course ) .",
    "massive gravity ( mgr ) can be traced back to fierz and pauli s ( fp ) 1939 formulation @xcite of the free massive spin-2 field in flat space .",
    "they uniquely fixed it by requiring that it represents @xmath0 ( rather than the generic 6 ) excitations  which then also guaranteed tachyon- and ghost - freedom .",
    "the fp action is the sum of the massless ",
    "linearized gr  kinetic and @xmath1 mass , terms and @xmath2 necessarily .",
    "but , as was realized much later @xcite , when stress - tensor sources @xmath3 are included , their induced interactions take the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , while @xmath6 .",
    "this discrete discontinuity of course persists as @xmath7 , leading to the well - known 25% error in the massive model s light - bending prediction .",
    "the possibility remained that this disease was caused by taking the linear limit before the massless one  @xcite .",
    "however , this triggers a new  and frightening  obstacle : at nonlinear level there ( generically ) arises a massive , _ ghost _ , 6th degree of freedom beyond the 2@xmath8 + 1=5 of fp  the so - called boulware - deser ( bd ) ghost  @xcite .",
    "consequently , interest in mgr dwindled , until a  presumably consistent  bd - ghost - free extension was recently constructed @xcite .",
    "these models involve , besides the dynamical metric @xmath9 , a second , fixed , ( fiducial ) background metric @xmath10 ; in tetrad formalism , @xmath11 is the background ( with inverse denoted by @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 the dynamical field .",
    "all index manipulations will be performed using the dynamical metric and tetrad , with greek and latin indices respectively representing world and local lorentz coordinates .",
    "the simplest example of nonlinear mgr has field equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is the fp mass when the theory is linearized around a cosmological @xmath18 background .",
    "the correct linearization requires that @xmath19 .",
    "the tetrads obey the symmetry constraint @xmath20m}=0 $ ] ; its curl implies the integrability condition @xmath21\\sigma}=0 $ ] , where @xmath22 is the contortion and @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the spin connections .    despite being ghost - free",
    ", subsequent investigations indicated that nonlinear mgr is still problematic .",
    "in particular , the characteristic equations in the eikonal limit were analyzed by two of the authors @xcite .",
    "it was found that the model admits superluminal ( second order ) shock wave solutions , which ironically , is due to the very constraint that removes the bd ghost . previously superluminal behavior was also uncovered in the model s stckelberg sector and decoupling limit  @xcite as well as in a spherically symmetric analysis on friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker  ( flrw ) backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "one might think that since the graviton in this theory is _ massive _ , it would automatically propagate _ slower _ than light .",
    "however this is not necessarily the case .",
    "a simple counter - example is the nonlinear proca field ( massive photon ) that also gives rise to a mode that propagates faster than light @xcite .",
    "after the analysis , by the other two authors , of the characteristic matrix of the theory using pde analysis  la cauchy and kovalevskaya @xcite , the negative results of refs .   and   were combined to show the massive theory not only gives rise to superluminal shock waves , but also local acausality @xcite that can arise even in an infinitesimal neighborhood of a spacetime event , as summarized in the next section .",
    "superluminal shock waves can be found by studying discontinuities in the first derivative of fields across a hypersurface @xmath25 , with normal @xmath26 chosen to be timelike ; this is denoted by @xmath27_\\sigma=\\xi_\\alpha{\\cal e}_\\mu{}^m , \\qquad   [ \\partial_\\alpha \\omega_\\mu{}^m{}_n]_\\sigma=\\xi_\\alpha \\omega_\\mu{}^m{}_n.\\ ] ] in particular we investigate the discontinuities in the scalar constraint ( this equation does _ not _ involve higher than first derivatives , and is responsible for removing the 6th , bd ghost , excitation ) @xmath28)+\\frac{1}2\\ , g^{\\mu\\nu } \\,[{g}_{\\mu\\nu}-\\tau_{\\mu\\nu}],\\ ] ] and in the curl of the symmetry constraint . denoting the contraction of  @xmath26 on an index of any tensor by an `` @xmath29 '' ,",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xmath30 , upon carrying out a shock analysis of the theory s constraints , we obtain the characteristic matrix @xcite @xmath31 & \\frac 12\\ , \\tilde k_j \\\\[3 mm ] [ f\\times k\\ell]_i & f_{ij}-g_{ij } f^{(3 ) } \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}{\\cal f}_{oo}\\\\[3mm]\\tilde\\omega^j\\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ] here @xmath32 , @xmath33 and  @xmath34 , where  @xmath35 , and @xmath36_i:=2\\ , \\epsilon_{ijk } f^{k\\mu } k^{j}{}_{\\nu\\mu}\\ell^\\nu_o$ ] and  @xmath37 .",
    "this gives a sufficient ( but not necessary ) condition for the _ field - dependent _ determinant to vanish : @xmath38 -\\frac 12\\ , \\tilde k_i\\ell^{ij}_{(3 ) } [ f\\times k\\ell]_j,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 . by choosing appropriate values of the fields",
    ", this determinant can be easily made to vanish , and so superluminal shocks are quite generic .",
    "an easy ( and by no means even the only ) demonstration of this fact is that for configurations such that @xmath40 in some region , it follows that @xmath41 whence the condition for a vanishing determinant of the characteristic matrix reduces to , in an obvious matrix notation , @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the non - vanishing of sums of every pair @xmath43 of eigenvalues of @xmath44 is sufficient and necessary for @xmath42 to imply @xmath45 .",
    "however , the eigenvalues of @xmath44 are not necessarily positive , because of the difference in being `` spacelike '' with respect to the two metrics .",
    "hence superluminal shocks can occur .",
    "moreover , acausality is now very likely to arise since closed timelike curves can be locally embedded into spacetime because spacelike surfaces can be characteristic ones as well .    to be more specific , specializing to a minkowski background ( say ) ,",
    "consider the case when the temporal direction , together with one of the spatial coordinates ( say the @xmath46-direction ) , of the fiducial and physical tetrads do not coincide .",
    "for example , if @xmath47 , then we have @xmath48 and @xmath49 , _",
    "i.e. _ , a constant time hypersurface is a characteristic .",
    "the action is invariant under simultaneous local lorentz rotations of both physical and fiducial tetrads .",
    "because of the interchange of the time- and @xmath46-direction some of these symmetries are `` spontaneously '' broken , while @xmath50-rotation and @xmath46-boost symmetries are kept .",
    "the @xmath51-rotation symmetry is broken ( because of the flip of the @xmath46-direction , physical and fiducial tetrads rotate oppositely so physical and fiducial tetrads configurations change ) , but rotating by @xmath52 , the new configurations thus generated become the same as the original ones .",
    "combining with the @xmath50-rotation symmetry , the solution has still a parity symmetry with respect to the 3-direction .",
    "the time - constant characteristic hypersurface must support propagation in some direction @xmath53 ( say ) .",
    "thanks to the @xmath50-rotation symmetry and parity symmetry with respect to @xmath46-direction , there must also be propagations in directions @xmath54 where @xmath55 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "thus , we can construct closed timelike curves , for instance form a loop : @xmath53 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . furthermore",
    ", since @xmath46-boosts do not change field configurations , and preserve @xmath47 , the same method shows that closed timelike curves can be formed on the hypersurface generated by boosts .",
    "moreover , although a @xmath59-boost does not keep the original tetrad configurations , it will preserve the condition @xmath49 , and thus the boost - hypersurface is again characteristic . because of @xmath50-rotational symmetry , the same holds if we consider a @xmath60-boost or mixture of @xmath59- and @xmath60-boosts . by appropriate boosting , any spacelike hypersurface can be characteristic .",
    "we emphasize that we used flat background and field configurations @xmath47 purely for simplicity ; it is not essential to our acausality .",
    "let us comment further on the difference between superluminality and acausality . in gr , we expect superluminal propagation to be also acausal , _",
    "i.e. _ we can construct closed timelike curves in the theory .",
    "however , in a theory that does not have coordinate invariance , superluminality does not always lead to acausality .",
    "for example , in newtonian gravity , there is no upper speed limit , but there is no problem with acausality .",
    "in fact , even in a theory with diffeomorphism invariance and lorentz invariance , one should remember that the mathematical structure of special relativity only requires _ existence _ of an _ upper bound _ on speed , and thus it could well be that the speed of light is very close to , but not really , the upper bound .",
    "thus , superluminality is not always disastrous@xcite .",
    "nonlinear mgr is manifestly _ not _ diffeomorphism invariant and the existence of superluminal shocks by itself is only an indication of _ possible _ disaster , but existence of acausality means that the theory is _ definitively _ bad .",
    "this scenario also happens in @xmath61 gravity , which is not locally lorentz invariant and thus can only be argued to be problematic via an acausality argument or the complete absence of predictability @xcite .",
    "our investigations showed that nonlinear mgr does indeed admit acausality , which is not only much easier to construct than in gr , but is _ local _ in nature .",
    "that is , unlike say , the gdel solution in gr , which in the neighborhood of any point of the closed timelike curve is still perfectly well - behaved ( _ i.e. _ , locally one always moves forward in time ) , the acausality in nonlinear mgr can be constructed in an infinitesimal regions of spacetime , and thus is much more serious .",
    "we mention that these problems are likely to persist in the bimetric extension of mgr , where the background field becomes dynamical  @xcite .",
    "ever since its conception , mgr has struggled to survive successive blows by adding successive epicycles ( for a review , see ref .  ) .",
    "our results demonstrate that its current incarnation is also untenable , due to the existence of not only superluminal shock waves , but also _ local _ acausality .",
    "[ the background metric is essentially an external field ; such fields are well - known to generate acausalities in higher - spin theory contexts  @xcite . ]",
    "furthermore this acausality occurs quite generically , not only in the model s decoupling limit .",
    "this means that mgr _ can not _ be a uv - complete fundamental theory of gravity .",
    "one may argue that it can still be useful as an effective field theory .",
    "that is , it could still be well - behaved without acausality on some specific background , separated from the problematic ones by a putative potential barrier .",
    "however , since our acausality argument only depends on the rather weak condition that @xmath41 , this situation is very unlikely .",
    "furthermore , such a potential barrier can not save the theory since it is no longer protected at the quantum level , especially since the natural scale of the theory is @xmath62 , where @xmath63 , the graviton mass , is necessarily very small .",
    "indeed , for @xmath64 , the value of such an energy scale is roughly @xmath65ev , above which the effective field description is no longer applicable .",
    "[ the absence of a supersymmetric ( @xmath66 ) extension even of fp  simply because massive spin 3/2 has only @xmath67 excitations ",
    "shows that susy s virtues are likely not available here either . ]",
    "the only possible way to remove the offending  ghost - removing , but also the cause of all our problems ",
    "scalar constraint would be to rely on the existence of a partially massless version of mgr ; unfortunately , this last hope is also excluded , precisely at nonlinear level @xcite .",
    "it is gratifying that that gr and su(3 ) ym are unique in both being exempt from the standard higgs mass coupling mechanism , and in being  isolated \" : not having viable  neighboring \" non - gauge models .",
