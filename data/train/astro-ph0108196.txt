    "neutrino emission from , and interactions above neutron stars has long been understood to be an important process in supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one interaction of particular interest is neutrino annihilation : @xmath0 because it converts neutrinos into electrons , which , due to their vastly larger cross - section , are an important source of energy for supernovae and possibly gamma - ray bursts .",
    "because of the strong gravity of neutron stars , relativistic effects must be included when calculating neutrino processes .",
    "rates of the @xmath1 interaction above a neutron star were originally calculated without gravity by @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite",
    "these neutrino annihilation rates were calculated with gravity and it was found that general relativistic effects significantly augmented the efficiency ; by up to a factor of four for supernovae and up to a factor of thirty for lone neutron stars at their critical density .    another situation where neutrino emission from neutron stars is important is in neutron star binary ( nsb ) systems .",
    "binary neutron star mergers have long been a possible progenitor for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , current trends would suggest that nsbs may be the progenitor of the `` short '' grbs , characterized by timescales @xmath2 second , which are thought to be distinct from the class of `` long '' grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as such , we are moved to study mechanisms for energy extraction .    due to the extreme high densities inside the neutron stars ,",
    "neutrinos , with their small cross - section , are a necessary component of the energetics of supernovae and compact binary merger scenarios .",
    "in particular , only a small proportion ( @xmath3% ) of the total energy ( which could be as high as the binding energy of a solar mass neutron star ) in neutrinos need be transferred to conventional matter in order to produce large , observable , energetic events .",
    "such a mechanism has been suggested as an energy source for grbs by @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the inter - star neutrino annihilation ; where each neutrino in an annihilation pair derives from each star in the binary .",
    "this is distinct from the single star neutrino annihilation discussed in @xcite .",
    "both processes will occur in a binary star system and will sum to give the total energy depostion from neutrino annihilation .",
