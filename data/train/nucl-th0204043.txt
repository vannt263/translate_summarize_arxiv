    "elastic nucleon - nucleus ( na ) scattering is known now as an excellent means of testing nuclear structure @xcite .",
    "results of the nonrelativistic theory for such scattering confidently can be used as predictive for information required in applied nuclear technology , where large amounts of nuclear reaction data including fission cross sections at intermediate energies are required for various challenging applications such as accelerator transmutation of waste , particularly the elimination of long - lived radioactive wastes with a spallation source , accelerator - based conversion to destroy weapon grade plutonium , accelerator - driven energy production to derive fission energy from thorium with concurrent destruction of the long - lived waste and without the production of nuclear weapon material , and accelerator production of tritium @xcite .",
    "there is also a great need for such information to be the base in analyzes of patient radiation therapy and protection .    with basic science",
    "there is the intellectual challenge to go beyond the physics of a single hadron and understand essential aspects of nuclear physics from first principles such as qcd @xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed that the qcd lagrangian involves nonlinear dynamics .",
    "such makes it very difficult then to understand nuclear physics fully from first principles , and so most of nuclear physics phenomena are interpreted in terms of appropriate effective degrees of freedom .",
    "one such view of natural phenomena in terms of energy scales ( @xmath1 ) , divides the nuclear - hadronic scale into the nuclear structure region @xmath2mev and the nucleon and nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) region , with structure and substructure scales @xmath3gev .",
    "this large separation between the hadronic energy scale and the nuclear binding scale poses stringent difficulties to apply nonlinear qcd directly to understand the physics of nuclei .",
    "however , quantitative calculations based on effective quantum field theory ( eqf ) techniques that arise from chiral symmetry provide an alternative approach . at present , this method is being extended to address few- and many - nucleon interactions . when combined with first principle calculations of the low energy constants from qcd , these eqf may provide a consistent qualitative understanding of properties of nuclei and of low to medium energy nuclear scattering .",
    "besides understanding the structure of nuclei from a qcd point of view , it is of interest to understand the dynamical behavior of nucleons in the presence of nuclear matter",
    ". the relevance of modified nn scattering amplitudes in the form of @xmath0-matrices in the nuclear medium with mean fields and pauli blocking is well known .",
    "these nn amplitudes and alternative reductions in the form of @xmath4-matrices have been used with qualitative success in the specification of nuclear densities in stable nuclei and the description of na scattering for projectile energies ( @xmath5 ) below 1gev . for @xmath5 above this limit",
    "we expect significant dynamical changes due to dibaryonic fusion with subsequent fission in the short range region of nn subsystems @xcite .    hitherto quite independently , several groups successfully described intermediate energy na scattering using two nucleon @xmath4- or @xmath0-matrices as driving effective interactions @xcite . among them",
    "we distinguish two main philosophies under which a description of na collisions is made and which we specify as the nonrelativistic schrdinger approach and as the relativistic dirac approach @xcite .",
    "common to both is the explicit use , and accurate treatment , of an interacting nn pair in the realm of other nucleons in a nucleus , and the need for an effective nn scattering amplitude known and defined on- and off - shell . for the more recent calculations of nonrelativistic na optical potentials in momentum space @xcite , a consistent treatment of the fully off - shell nn @xmath4- or @xmath0-matrices",
    "have been used .    as nearly all available nn potentials",
    "@xcite have been fitted to nn scattering data up to 350mev , a nonrelativistic treatment of the full - folding optical model suffices most na scattering applications consistent with the input nn model .",
    "recently , however , inversion potentials developed to fit elastic nn phase - shifts for @xmath6gev have been used within the full - folding approach for projectile energies as high as 500 mev @xcite . despite the fact that these were nonrelativistic applications , they allowed a better description of data relative to what was found previously using traditional nn potential models",
    "the lack of relativistic kinematics as well as pion production and @xmath7 excitations within the nn pair did not manifest itself as a dramatic limitation of the model , even though the theoretical confidence level was reached .",
    "it is the primary aim of this work to remove these shortcomings and formulate a momentum space full - folding model using _ minimum - relativity_. with the appropriate modifications to the existing analysis programs we expect to extend the confidence level into the gev region and to obtain high quality full - folding optical model results at energies as high as 1.5gev .",
    "extensive studies of na scattering in the context of relativistic dirac models have been made @xcite . while these models are closer to a fundamental formulation with the inclusion of relativistic kinematics and dynamics within a single framework , to date they all have used fitted nn interactions that do not describe the phase shift data well .",
    "this is a serious drawback as it is well established that any folding model requires a high quality nn interaction as input .",
    "the description of na scattering requires only modest nuclear matter densities and thus the need of nn @xmath0-matrices is less demanding .",
    "furthermore only for projectile energies below @xmath8mev are nuclear medium effects predominant with specific treatment of pauli blocking and self consistent mean field effects being crucial . for medium and higher nn energies ,",
    "meson production and intrinsic hadron excitations within the interacting pair are important .",
    "consequently the @xmath4-matrix no longer is unitary in the elastic channel .",
    "however as the low energy @xmath4- and @xmath0-matrices are well defined within potential scattering theory , we seek a continuation of nn potential models with an nn optical model potential ( nnomp ) .",
    "we have devised and generated nnomp for @xmath9 gev and applied them to na elastic scattering .",
    "the calculations are based upon a relativistically corrected full - folding optical model in momentum space that is an extension of a nonrelativistic predecessor @xcite .",
    "since the lorentz contraction scales as the ratio of the projectile energy to its mass , it requires nucleon projectile energies above @xmath10mev to have sizeable contraction effects .",
    "it is safe to include relativistic kinematics in folding calculations when the projectile energy surpasses 300mev .",
    "relativistic kinematics is widely used in pion - nucleus scattering @xcite .",
    "an excellent discussion on some aspects about relativistic kinematics in na scattering is given in the review by ray , hoffmann and coker @xcite .",
    "one of the important advantages of finding a nonrelativistic na optical model potential is its well defined structure in terms of interacting nucleon pairs .",
    "this framework has been remarkably successful in the study of low energy scattering with its link to the nuclear shell model of single particle bound states .",
    "the combination of target correlations and high quality nn interactions has provided a good first order description of the na dynamics .",
    "this nonrelativistic theoretical approach has been applied with success for many energies and targets and now it is timely to incorporate relativistic corrections so that calculations can be made with energies as high as 1.5gev .",
    "a brief summary of the current full - folding optical model is given in section ii and in which the points where relativistic kinematic corrections are to be made are stressed .",
    "the current experimental situation of nn phase shift analysis up to 3gev is discussed in section iii .",
    "we describe also how the nnomp are determined by the nn phase shift data . in section",
    "iv we set the framework of the @xmath0-matrix calculations and specify minimal relativity considerations . in section v some details of the full - folding calculations and various applications are presented .",
    "we discuss the role of the fermi motion in the nn effective interaction and analyze the sensitivity of na scattering observables upon the use of alternative approaches for the relativistic kinematics .",
    "we also examine total cross sections for nucleon elastic scattering and differential observables at beam energies from the hundreds of mev up into the gev regime .",
    "section vi contains a summary and the main conclusions of our study .",
    "finally , we have included two appendices . in appendix",
    "a the relativistic kinematics transformations in the context of the full - folding approach are outlined as extracted from the articles by aaron , amado and young @xcite and by giebink @xcite . in appendix",
    "b we present the algorithm we have used to determine the nnomp from data .",
    "in the nonrelativistic theory of the optical model potential , the coupling between the projectile and the target nucleus in the elastic channel is given by the convolution between a two - body effective interaction and the target ground - state mixed density .",
    "in the projectile - nucleus c.m .",
    "frame , the collision of a projectile of kinetic energy @xmath11 is described by the optical potential @xmath12 which in a momentum space representation is expressed as @xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14 represents target ground state single - particle wave functions of energy @xmath15 , and @xmath16 restricts the sum to all levels up to the fermi surface @xmath17 .",
    "the two - body @xmath18 matrix is evaluated at starting energies @xmath19 consisting of the mass of the projectile @xmath20 , its kinetic energy @xmath11 , the mass of the target nucleon @xmath21 and its binding energy @xmath15 .",
    "the subscript a+1 indicates matrix elements in the projectile - nucleus c.m .",
    "frame and recoil effects have been neglected for simplicity . in the most recent full - folding calculations of the optical potential for na scattering , where explicit medium effects are incorporated in the two - body effective interaction , the @xmath18-matrix",
    "is represented by an infinite nuclear matter @xmath0-matrix @xcite . in the absence of these medium modifications ,",
    "the @xmath18-matrix has usually been approximated by the two - body scattering matrix associated with the collisions of two free particles @xcite .",
    "none of these full - folding approaches incorporate the necessary relativistic kinematics needed for high energy processes .",
    "the above expression for the optical potential requires the @xmath18 matrix in the projectile - nucleus c.m .",
    "however , most practical two - body potential models are designed to account for the scattering data in the two - body c.m . , where a one - body wave equation ( a schrdinger kind equation ) is used to construct the realistic two - body bare potential fit to elastic scattering and ground state data .",
    "the practical problem that emerges then is how to make use of this description to extract the needed effective interaction in the projectile - nucleus c.m . with an adequate account of relativistic effects",
    "this has been a long standing problem in nuclear research and various approaches have been proposed and discussed elsewhere @xcite . in the procedure followed here we retain the dynamical structure of the optical potential as expressed by eq .",
    "( [ uff ] ) and identify , _ via _ a lorentz boost , the corresponding kinematical variables involved in the two - body collision .",
    "thus , the transformation of the @xmath18 matrix from the two - body ( 2b ) to the projectile - nucleus ( a+1 ) c.m .",
    "frame can be done by considering three separate aspects .",
    "first , as lorentz invariance of the flux is required , an overall normalization factor usually referred as the mller flux factor mediates between the scattering amplitudes in the two frames .",
    "second , the kinematics in the projectile - nucleus c.m .",
    "frame needs to be transformed to the two - body c.m .",
    "system , which is the reference frame where the bare potential model is defined . and third , the transformation of the scattering matrix from the two - body to the projectile - nucleus c.m .",
    "frames involves the rotation of the spins , an effect referred as the wigner rotation .",
    "this contribution has been studied in the context of the relativistic ` no - pair ' potential for nucleon - nucleus scattering by tjon and wallace @xcite and was observed to yield rather moderate effects at nucleon energies between 200 and 500 mev .",
    "although there is no statement about the importance of wigner rotation contribution at the higher energies considered here , we shall neglect them in the present work .",

    "what remains to be specified is a lorentz transformation for the relative momenta @xmath36 and @xmath37 . to this purpose",
    "we followed the approaches introduced by aaron , amado and young ( aay ) @xcite and giebink @xcite .",
    "although , both assume a representation of the scattering matrix in the two - body c.m . , they differ in the way the lorentz boost is devised .",
    "details are given in appendix a where we show that in both cases the relative momenta can be cast into the form @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 being functions of the momenta of the colliding particles ( eqs .",
    "( [ k_gie ] ) or ( [ k_aay ] ) ) . at low beam energies",
    "both prescriptions meet the nonrelativistic limit @xmath41 , as expected .",
    "of the whole spectrum , low and medium energy nn scattering traditionally is described in terms of hermitian potentials . at medium energies , production processes and inelasticities become possible and several elementary systems composed of nucleons and mesons contribute to nn scattering . at present",
    "there is no high quality description of nn scattering above the inelastic threshold either in terms of qcd or in terms of nucleons and mesons",
    ".    a high quality fit of on - shell @xmath4-matrices by means of a potential model is very desirable as it provides extensions of the effective interaction into the off - shell domain and into a nuclear medium , which are important dynamical features in few and many body calculations .",
    "many examples using microscopic optical model potentials for elastic nucleon - nucleus scattering and bremsstrahlung reactions , have shown that it is crucial to have on - shell @xmath4-matrices in the best possible agreement with nn data at all energies .",
    "concomitantly one needs high precision nn data against which one can specify nn interactions . to this purpose",
    "we have relied on a large body of experimental nn data whose parameterization in terms of amplitudes and phase shifts are smooth for energies to 3 gev @xcite .",
    "this is a supposition for the construction of an nn potential above 300 mev .",
    "there are many studies of few and many body problems in the low energy regime @xmath42mev and the results have consequences for any model extension above threshold .",
    "we note in this context that significant off - shell differences in @xmath4-matrices are known to exist among the theoretically well motivated boson exchange models of nn scattering .",
    "it remains difficult to attribute with certainty any particular dynamical or kinematical feature with those differences .",
    "non - locality , explicit energy dependence and features associated with relativistic kinematics are some possibilities .",
    "in contrast , there is the quantum inverse scattering approach by which on - shell @xmath4-matrices can be continued into the off - shell domain .",
    "a specific method is the gelfand - levitan - marchenko inversion algorithm for sturm - liouville equations .",
    "this approach to specify @xmath4-matrices off - shell is appropriate when the physical s - matrix is unitary and the equation of motion is of the sturm - liouville type .",
    "such is valid without modification for nn @xmath4-matrices in the energy regime below 300 mev , and for the unitary part of the s - matrix above that energy .    in the spirit of general inverse problems ,",
    "we have extended the available low energy potential by additional complex potential terms which are determined from a perfect reproduction of the experimental data ( here the partial wave phase shift analysis ) for all energies above 300 mev . by",
    "that means nn optical models were generated , separately for each partial wave .",
    "the algorithm we have developed allows studies of complex local and/or separable potentials in combination with any background reference potential @xcite .",
    "here we limit the reference potential to the well known real coordinate space potentials from paris @xcite , nijmegen @xcite ( reid93 , nijmegen - i , nijmegen - ii ) , argonne @xcite ( av18 ) , and from inversion @xcite . to them",
    "we add channel - dependent complex separable potentials with energy dependent strengths @xcite . for a given input data set",
    "there is a unique nnomp within a given potential class .",
    "some of these issues are outlined in appendix b.    nn scattering is a long standing problem which has been reviewed often as the database developed .",
    "the low energy data has been analyzed by the vpi / gwu group @xcite for @xmath43 mev , the nijmegen group with the nn phase shift results pwa93 for @xmath44 mev , and by machleidt @xcite giving the bonn - cd-2000 . of these",
    ", the vpi / gwu group has given many solutions over the years , the latest are for energies to 3 gev @xcite .",
    "we have used the solutions sp00 , fa00 and wi00 in our calculations and found results that differ but marginally . thus hereafter in the main we refer solely to the results of calculations based upon sp00 .    as with the nn phase shift analysis ,",
    "one boson exchange potentials have received several critical reviews @xcite , including observations that there are small variations between phase shift analysis and potential models below the subthreshold domain @xmath45 mev .",
    "a theoretically stable result would require many quantities , that need be specified _ a priori _ , to be determined by independent sources .",
    "at present that does not seem feasible and all current potentials rely upon fits of many of their parameters to the same data .",
    "all such fits , however , have been made independently of each other and are based upon differing theoretical specifications of the boson exchange model dynamics .    above 300 mev , reaction channels open and the elastic channel s - matrix no longer is unitary .",
    "only the @xmath7(1232 ) resonance has a low energy threshold and a relative small width of 120 mev .",
    "therefore it is the only resonance we expect to be obviously visible in the energy variation of the elastic scattering phase shifts . in particular",
    "one notices typical variations in the @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 channels .",
    "otherwise the phase shifts to 3 gev vary smoothly as functions of energy .",
    "together with the strong spin - isospin coupling , this property infers optical potentials that are channel dependent in contrast to the na case for which assumed central and spin - orbit potentials are partial wave independent . the plethora of reaction channels that open to 3 gev , and",
    "the requirement of an nn optical potential prescription , mean that it is an interesting task for a microscopic model to link qcd substructures to nn scattering phase shift functions in analogy to that successful prescription by which na optical potentials have been determined by folding effective interactions .    to describe this developing system for @xmath9 gev we used feshbach theory to specify the optical potential .",
    "an important feature of that theory is the projection operator formalism with @xmath49 and @xmath1 subspaces , which divide the complete hilbert space @xmath50 into the elastic scattering channel , the @xmath49 space , and the inelastic and reaction channels , the @xmath1 space .",
    "this infers a complex and separable component in the optical potential with an energy dependent strength .",
    "if a very large number of intermediate states contribute , the effect equates to a local potential operator .    a covariant description of nn scattering formally is given by the bethe - salpeter equation @xmath51 where @xmath52 are invariant amplitudes that are based upon all connected two particle irreducible diagrams .",
    "this equation serves generally as an ansatz for approximations . of those ,",
    "the three dimensional blankenbecler - sugar reduction is popular and sufficient for our purpose to define an nn potential @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes are now expressed with the reduced terms and they satisfy a three - dimensional equation @xmath53 taking matrix elements with only positive energy spinors , an equation with minimum relativity results for the nn @xmath4-matrix , namely @xmath54 using the substitutions @xmath55 and @xmath56 a simplified form of the @xmath4-matrix is obtained .",
    "it is the familiar lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath57 the strategic importance of this result is that it defines a sensible continuation of a @xmath4-matrix , constrained on - shell by the experimental data and phase shift analysis , into the off - shell domain as required by the full - folding optical model .",
    "thus we do not rely primarily on a fundamental theoretical result but rather on experimental nn data and the moderate sensitivity of na scattering to alternative off - shell continuations .",
    "it is an important result also of this analysis that on - shell equivalent nn optical model potentials yield very similar na scattering observables  irrespectively of differences in the off - shell domain and the constraint off - shell continuation defined with eqs.([eqn_iii.8]-[eqn_iii.12 ] ) .",
    "a crucial step in the description of na scattering processes has been the definition of an effective interaction based on the bare two - body interaction in free space .",
    "such has been the philosophy of the early ( local ) folding models and the most recent nonrelativistic full - folding models @xcite . the effective interaction , @xmath58 in eq . ( [ uff ] ) ,",
    "is obtained in the framework of brueckner - bethe - goldstone for the @xmath0-matrix .",
    "the extension of this approach to high energy applications requires a minimal account of relativistic corrections . along this line",
    "we have followed the discussion by brockmann and machleidt @xcite , where a relativistic three - dimensional reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation is used to describe the interaction between nucleons in the nuclear medium .",
    "if only matrix elements between positive - energy spinors are taken , then the medium - modified invariant amplitude in an arbitrary frame reads ( cf .",

    "this approach , in the context of the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock approximation , has been applied with reasonable success to the study of infinite nuclear matter @xcite as well as finite nuclei ground state properties @xcite .",
    "an appealing feature of the above equation for @xmath64 is its direct connection with the bare nn potential model in free space . indeed , adopting the same definitions as in eqs .",

    "the density dependence of the one - boson - exchange interaction by means of effective dirac spinors and the explicit relativistic kinematics are features which have no counterpart in the traditional brueckner approach .",
    "however , with the suppression of these relativistic dynamical effects we can extract a minimum of relativistic features needed in the nonrelativistic model . in our approach selfconsistency is demanded with the following choice for the quasi - particle spectrum , @xmath68 as in the usual brueckner - bethe - goldstone approach , the quasi - potential @xmath69 is obtained selfconsistently with the use of the continuous choice at the fermi surface . as a first check , we consider the case of two nucleons interacting in free space , for which the pauli blocking operator becomes the identity and the nuclear selfconsistent field vanishes .",

    "this result supports the use of the nonrelativistic selfconsistent scheme to obtain the quasi - potentials .    with the above considerations , the calculation of the two - body effective interaction needed in the full - folding optical potential proceeds with the proper choice of the @xmath62-invariant in eq .",
    "( [ gmat ] ) , and consistent with the starting energy @xmath81 defined in eq .",

    "the manifestation of this feature becomes clear when the fermi average enters fully off - shell in the evaluation of the full - folding potential , as discussed in the following section .      a global assessment of the full - folding model to the inclusion of relativistic kinematics and features of the underlying nn potential model over a wide energy range",

    "the data are represented with open circles . from this figure",
    "we observe a remarkable agreement between the full nnomp @xmath0-matrix results and the data , particularly at energies above @xmath109200 mev .",
    "such is not the case for the @xmath4-matrix approach , or when the imaginary part of the bare nn potential is suppressed . in the former case",
    "the lack of nuclear medium effects becomes pronounced for projectile energies as high as 500 mev in the case of pb , but less for lighter nuclei .",
    "conversely , the imaginary part of the nnomp is crucial for the adequate description of cross section data at beam energies above 400 mev , as observed when comparing the labeled and unlabeled curves .",
    "total reaction cross sections for proton - nucleus elastic scattering at high energies are of increasing interest , particularly with current trends using spallation facilities with high energy beams .",

    "such is not the case below 400 mev , particularly in the case of pb , where a clear departure of the @xmath4-matrix with respect to the @xmath0-matrix results is observed .",
    "however , these differences are smaller than the ones due to the presence of the imaginary part of the nnomp .",
    "in fact , we can see clear differences within the @xmath0-matrix approach by including and suppressing the imaginary part of the nnomp at energies above 500 mev . since reaction cross section data are scarce above 700 mev ( only two data points for all four targets ) , the curves ( marked with triangles ) constitute a high energy prediction of our work .",
    "another feature observed from figs .",
    "[ xtotalx4 ] and [ xreactx4 ] is the trend of all cross sections to reach a plateau above 650 mev .",
    "we have scrutinized more closely this feature and find that both @xmath114 and @xmath115 exhibit an almost linear dependence with @xmath116 , with target masses 16@xmath117208 . to illustrate this point we show in fig .",

    "in contrast , the inelasticities of the nn interaction become important above 400 mev as was observed particularly in the description of the total cross sections .",
