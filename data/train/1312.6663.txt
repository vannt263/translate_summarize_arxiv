    "this state is characterized by magnetization in the plane of the nanostructure , tangential to concentric circles , and a small core where the magnetization is perpendicular to the plane .",
    "one can define the circulation @xmath5 for counterclockwise ( ccw ) in - plane magnetization direction , or @xmath6 for cw direction ; the polarity is @xmath7 for magnetization of the vortex core along the @xmath8 axis , and @xmath9 for the opposite direction ( @xmath10 ) . the physical description of the vortex properties is usually made within two analytical models : rigid vortex model @xcite and the two - vortex model @xcite .",
    "magnetic structures with vortices have many potential applications , e.g. , as spin - torque nano - oscillators ( stno s ) @xcite , magnetic random memories ( mram s ) @xcite , or logic gates @xcite .",
    "the applications usually require magnetic elements arranged in a regular array where the characterization of the interaction between them is required : in some cases it is necessary for the functioning of the device , in other cases it has to be minimized .",
    "this interaction allows the coupling of the nanoobjects@xcite and the loss - less transmission of energy@xcite .",
    "when a magnetic vortex structure , for example , a magnetic nanodisk , is in equilibrium , its vortex core rests at its center , and the structure has magnetic flux - closure . in this configuration",
    "the coupling with nearby nanoelements is minimum .",
    "conversely , when the vortex structure is out of equilibrium , with its core displaced e.g. , by an external magnetic field or a spin - polarized current , magnetostatic coupling with the neighbor elements results .",
    "the dependence with distance of this coupling has been the subject of several studies in recent years @xcite .",
    "once the excitation of the vortex cores through an external agent is over , they return to their equilibrium position , performing a periodic spiral - like trajectory .",
    "this motion , called gyrotropic motion , has been described analytically through thiele s equation , that is derived from landau - lifshitz equation @xcite , and has also been obtained from micromagnetic simulations .",
    "the angular frequency of this motion depends on the saturation magnetization of the material and on the aspect ratio of the disks .",
    "it is typically in the range of hundreds of mhz .",
    "also , several experiments using different techniques have expanded our knowledge of this phenomenon , e.g. ,    @mbox= cite@citenum @space@spacechar @super@kern    @open [    @close ] @xcite    .     and @xmath11 , separated by a center to center distance @xmath0 . ]",
    "all these considerations justify why vortex core dynamics , and vortex core interactions , have recently attracted the interest of researchers in the area of nanomagnetism .",
    "recent studies , both theoretical and experimental , explore the vortex core interaction and vortex dynamics in identical disks pairs@xcite .    the simplest system where one can study interacting nanodisks is , of course , a pair of such magnetic structures ; it is therefore the ideal system for the investigation of the properties of the interaction , its dependence with distance , etc .",
    "some devices were proposed using nanodisks with different diameters , e.g. , in magnonic devices@xcite or in nano - oscillators@xcite , although there are few studies of the interactions in more complex structures , such as nonidentical disk arrays in which each element interacts with all the others@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "the problem of the interaction between pairs of magnetic nanodisks with magnetic vortex structures and different gyrotropic frequencies , is analyzed both analytically and through micromagnetic simulation .",
    "the present discussion is applicable to pairs of magnetic nanodisks that have different gyrotropic frequencies , arising either from different radii , or different materials , or different thicknesses .",
