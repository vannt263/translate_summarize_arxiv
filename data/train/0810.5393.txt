    "the most luminous non - nuclear x - ray sources in nearby galaxies occur in regions of high rates of current star formation ( roberts & warwick 2000 ; colbert & ptak 2002 ; swartz et al 2004 ; liu & mirabel 2005 ) . whether these ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are powered by some exotic emission process or represent the extreme end of stellar - mass black hole formation ( in excess of @xmath420  m@xmath9 , the upper limit for stars of moderate metallicity evolving in isolation , fryer & kalogera 2001 ) is a matter of current debate ( for recent reviews on ulxs see fabbiano 2006 ; king 2006 ; fabbiano & white 2006 ) .",
    "different models have been proposed to explain the ulx phenomena and they can be grouped into different broad categories : ( i ) geometrically / mechanically- ( king et al . 2001a ; fabrika & mescheryakov 2001 ; fabrika 2004 ; poutanen et al .",

    "in addition , spectral curvatures have been detected in the x - ray spectra of a few luminous ulxs ( dewangan et al .",
    "2004 ; 2006 and references therein ) , which suggest that these objects are beamed stellar - mass black hole binaries .",
    "on the other hand , by analogy with the x - ray spectra of galactic black hole binaries , a multicolor disk ( mcd ) blackbody component with temperature around 100 ev ( plus powerlaw ) has been considered as the signature of a cool accretion disk of an imbh system ( miller et al .",

    "; kong et al .",
    "in addition , quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) with long quasi periods have been detected in some ulxs ( liu et al 2005 ; strohmayor & mushotzky et al .",
    "2003 ; soria et al . 2004 ; strohmayer et al . 2007 ) .",
    "comparison of these results with the scaling relation between black hole mass and break - frequency of qpo suggests the presence of imbhs in these ulxs ( belloni & hasinger 1990 ) . however , the suggestions of imbh systems based on the mcd model have been questioned and alternate explanations in the frame works of stellar - mass black hole systems have been proposed ( king & pounds 2003 ; roberts et al .",
    "2005 ; stobbart et al . 2006 ; goncalves & soria 2006 ; barnard et al .",
    "in addition , hui , krolik & hubeney ( 2005 ) have shown that non - lte accretion flows around imbhs can easily generate hot accretion disks with temperatures up to 1  kev , which is in sharp contrast to the conventional mcd model .",
    "all these results suggest that ulxs are heterogeneous objects ( feng & kaaret 2005 , 2006 ; roberts et al .",
    "2006 ; winter et al . 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "similarly , optical photometric and spectroscopic studies have revealed that stars , star clusters , ionized nebulae , etc .",
    "are possible optical counterparts of ulxs ( ghosh et al .",
    "2001 , 2005 ; soria et al . 2005 ; ptak et al . 2006 ; ramsey et al .",
    "optical spectroscopic studies on the local environments of some ulxs have detected different emission lines , which suggest that both shock and photo - ionization excitations are the dominant physical processes around these objects ( abolmasov 2007a , b ; mucciarelli et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 ; zepf et al . 2007 ) .",
    "_ in summary , no clear picture is emerging to differentiate between compact accretor models of ulxs , yet it is certain that most are young objects born in extreme environments_.    some of the highest star formation rates are induced by interactions among gas - rich ( spiral ) galaxies and it is natural to expect these interacting galaxies to host numerous ulxs .",
    "this is consistent with the observed anti - correlation between the number of ulxs per galaxy and nearest neighbor distance ( swartz et al .",
    "the face - on pair of merging galaxies ngc  4038/4039 ( the antennae ) is the prototypical example of this paradigm : as many as 18 ulxs are present in the antennae depending on the distance adopted and defining ulxs to have x - ray luminosities above @xmath0  ergs  s@xmath1 ( zezas et al .",
    "in addition , we have found from our survey of ulxs in the _ chandra _  archive of galaxies that there is a correlation between the number of ulxs and the far infrared luminosity of interacting galaxies ( swartz et al .",
    "2004 ) . presently , there are a few known interacting galaxies that host elevated number of ulxs .",
    "thus , x - ray studies of interacting galaxies are important , specially from the perspective of ulx studies .",
    "the galaxy pair ngc  5774/5775  is another example of star formation triggered by tidal interaction between galaxies resulting in the creation of many luminous x - ray sources .",
    "ngc  5775 is a sbc starburst galaxy seen nearly edge - on , @xmath11 , with star formation extending throughout its visible disk . as with many interacting pairs ( e.g. , kennicutt et al .",
    "1987 ) , star formation in ngc  5775 , although triggered by external forces , appears to result from tidally induced gas motions within the disk of ngc  5775 rather than by mass transfer between the galaxies .",
    "it is connected to ngc  5774 by hi bridges ( irwin 1994 ) but there are no other obvious distortions in optical images such as tidal tails or disk warping common in more advanced stages of interaction ( for example , tidal tails are the defining optical characteristics of the antennae merging galaxy pair ) .",
    "the outer disk of the face - on companion sab(rs)d galaxy ngc  5774 may have been disrupted by the interaction ( irwin 1994 ) and this is the apparent source of the bridge material .",
    "the rate of mass transfer through the bridge is estimated to be only about 510 m@xmath9  yr@xmath1 and irwin ( 1994 ) estimates the age of the interaction from dynamical considerations to be @xmath410@xmath12  yr . star formation in ngc  5774 is proceeding at a normal rate for an sd galaxy .",
    "neither galaxy displays strong agn activity ( ho , filippenko & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory image of the ngc  5774/5775  pair reflects the contrasts between the ir - bright starburst galaxy ngc  5775 and its relatively normal companion ngc  5774 . only nine sources are detected in ngc  5774 and there is no diffuse component visible .",
    "in contrast , twenty - five bright discrete sources are visible above the detection limit of @xmath410@xmath13  ergs  s@xmath1  in the disk of ngc  5775 .",
    "the disk sources are embedded in extensive diffuse hot gas .",
    "several more sources are in the surrounding region including the hi bridges .",
    "thus , this interacting pair of galaxies , ngc  5774/5775 is an ideal laboratory to investigate the formation of x - ray sources on the bridges , to study the role of starburst activities on the evolution of galaxies and formation of ulxs , and finally to study the nature of a large number of wide varieties of ulxs . to achieve these scientific objectives ,",
    "we have analyzed the available x - ray , optical , and radio data of the galaxy pair and their surroundings ; supplemented by new optical imaging , spectroscopy , and radio continuum measurements . in   2 , we describe the observations , our data reduction methods and results . in   3 ,",

    "such huge discrepancy may be due to the non - linear relation between the total luminosity of hmxrbs and the low - sfr of ngc  5774 ( grimm , gilfanov , & sunyaev 2003a ) .",

    "three ulxs of ngc  5774 are located in active starforming regions on the spiral arms of this galaxy .",
    "this indicates that the formation of ulxs strongly depends on its immediate local environment but not on the global properties of the host galaxy .",
    "twenty four x - ray sources ( excluding the agn , s26 ) are detected in ngc  5775 .",
    "observed counts of these twenty four sources are plotted against the cumulative number of sources in fig .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that the xlf of the starburst galaxy ngc  5775 is best represented as a single powerlaw ( slope=@xmath52 ) whereas the xlf of all the sources studied requires a broken powerlaw with a steeper slope at high flux . for ngc  5774 , both a single and a broken powerlaw provide acceptable fits ( there are too few sources to differentiate ) but the slope of the single powerlaw is @xmath53 , steeper than that of ngc  5775 .",
    "the value of the slope of the xlf of ngc  5775 is consistent with the mean values of -0.65@xmath50.16 for the interacting / merging and -0.79@xmath50.24 for spirals ( colbert et al .",
    "the xlfs of x - ray sources in spiral galaxies with moderate star formation rates are relatively flat ( e.g. , kilgard et al .  2002 ; colbert et al .  2004 ) , which means that the most luminous individual sources dominate the total x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath29 ) from these galaxies ( grimm , gilfanov , & sunyaev 2003b )",

    "thus , the xlfs with same slopes but different nfs indicate for evolutionary stages of galaxies .",
    "for example , comparison of xlfs between ngc  5775 and the antennae or ngc4485/4490 shows that these galaxies have similar spectral slopes but the nf values are large for the antennae or ngc  4485/4490 .",

    "parameters of the @xmath56 component can be used to compute different parameters ( emission measure , particle number density , total gas mass , thermal energy , cooling time , etc . ) to determine the physical properties of the diffuse gas . however",
    ", large uncertainties of the volume - filling factor will introduce huge errors in the values of these parameters ( strickland & stevens 2000 ) .",

    "the temperature of the diffuse gas is slightly lower than the expected diffuse gas temperature of @xmath40.5@xmath50.07 kev detected in interacting galaxies ( read & ponman 1998 ) .",
    "this indicates that ngc  5775 is in early phase of interaction .",
    "the value of the abundance from the @xmath56 model suggest that the metallicity of the diffuse gas is sub - solar .",
    "kewley , geller , & barton ( 2005 ) have shown that the metallicity of gas in the central regions of starburst galaxies in pairs like ngc  5774/5775  tends to be sub - solar .",
    "they attribute this to channeling of metal - poor fuel from the outskirts of the galaxies toward the central star - forming regions .",
    "most likely , the nw and se bridges are transporting outer - materials into ngc  5775 and thus we expect the diffuse gas of this galaxy to be composed of sub - solar materials .    we have detected outflow from the central region of ngc  5775 , which is shown in fig .",
    ". the observed outflow may be the starburst - driven superwinds from the starburst galaxy , ngc  5775 .",
    "this indicates that ngc  5775 is in the superwind phase , which can be used as tool to study its evolutionary process .",
    "comparison of the observed results with the post - starburst evolutionary model results of taniguchi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggest that ngc  5775 have gone through both the starburst phase and the early - b star phase and entered into the superwind phase .",
    "this means that the wide - spread starformation took place around 2@xmath210@xmath60  yr ago ( taniguchi et al .",
    "this is consistent with the estimated age of the interaction from dynamical considerations ( irwin 1994 ) .",
    "in addition , these results are also consistent with the independent results derived from the studies of xlf and the x - ray spectrum of the diffuse gas of ngc  5775 .",
    "the fact that star formation is occurring throughout the disk of ngc  5775 yet there is very little visible distribution of the disk / spiral structure of the galaxy pair indicating that the starburst in ngc  5775 is triggered by tidal forces redistributing the gas within the galaxy disk rather than by gas transfer between the galaxies .",
    "thus , the hot diffuse gas was produced during the wide - spread starformation episodes in ngc  5775 and is proceeding at a rate of 5.4  m@xmath9  yr@xmath1 .",
    "diffuse gas has two origins : thermal and non - thermal .",
    "thermal component is due to supernova remnants ( snrs ) and stellar winds .",
    "contributions from snrs can be computed using a relationship between the far infrared ( fir ) luminosity and the supernova rate of starburst galaxies , which is as follows ( mattila & meikle 2001 ) :    @xmath61    the fir luminosity ( l@xmath62 ) of ngc  5775 is 3.14@xmath210@xmath63  l@xmath9 ( devereux & eales 1989 ) , which corresponds to 0.084 sn per year .",
    "thus , @xmath64 sne exploded during the interval of 2@xmath210@xmath60  yr .",
    "if we assume that a massive star evolves to explode into a sn in 10@xmath60  yr and 10@xmath65  ergs is released from each sn explosion , then total thermal energy associated with the diffuse gas of ngc  5775 will be 1.7@xmath210@xmath66  ergs .",
    "in addition , there will be some more contribution to the thermal energy from stellar winds .",
    "of course , part of the total thermal energy will be lost due to radiative processes , gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy of the galactic wind / outflow .",
    "large fraction of the thermal energy will be dissipated during the superwind phase of ngc  5775 , which may last @xmath67  yr ( taniguchi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "results of the spectral fitting show that the powerlaw component contributes more than double to the diffuse gas compared to the @xmath56 component .",
    "powerlaw sources are most likely unresolved x - ray binaries plus x - ray emitting stars . in addition , we find that the total diffuse gas contributes less than @xmath45.0% to the total x - ray luminosity of ngc  5775 .",
    "these results along with the non - detection of the nuclear source plus detection of the galactic wind suggest that ngc  5775 is in the beginning of the evolutionary process similar to ngc  3395/3396 ( brassington , read & ponman 2005 ) .",
    "this is further supported by the evolutionary model of taniguchi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which suggests that , presently , ngc  5775 is in the superwind phase and after spending @xmath67  yr this galaxy will enter into the liner phase ( taniguchi et al .",

    "these models are yet to be examined with the multiwavelength properties of starburst galaxies .",

    "we could not detect the optical counterparts of source # 29 and 48 and they are close to d@xmath6 isophote of ngc  5775 and they are most likely hmxrbs in the halo of this galaxy .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that hydrodynamical simulations of interacting galaxies suggest that the gas in the connecting bridges is shocked or compressed due to interaction , which triggers wide - spread starformation episode and some gas may fall onto the outer disk ( struck & smith 2003 ) .",
    "if this is true , then we would expect many x - ray sources to form at the interface of the disk and bridges .",

    "thus , detection of an non - spherical heii nebula at the position of the ulx will support the beaming model of these two ulxs .",
    "nebulae formed around imbhs will be much smaller in size compared to the nebulae formed by sne or jets .",
    "thus , the observed sizes of diffuse emission around s04 and s46 suggest that they are not imbh systems .",
    "another mechanism that is prevalent in interacting galaxies and may lead to the formation of luminous x - ray sources is the formation of super star clusters ( sscs ) .",
    "there is a general correlation between the formation of sscs and galaxy mergers ( whitmore 2000 ) .",
    "keel & borne ( 2003 ) have shown that this trend applies also to systems like ngc  5774/5775  and does not require direct contact to occur .",
    "theory suggests that the most massive black holes may come from mergers of massive main sequence ( portegies  zwart et al .",
    "2004 ) or protostars ( soria 2006 ) within these young massive sscs .",
    "if these intermediate - mass black holes with masses @xmath10320  m@xmath9   can form in sscs and can capture a stellar companion ( baumgardt et al .",
    "2005 ) then x - ray luminosities near the eddington limit , 1.3@xmath210@xmath13  ergs  s@xmath1 , are likely to produce ultraluminous x - ray sources .",
    "the ulx x-1 in m82 is believed to be of this type ( strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 ; agrawal & misra 2006 ; dewangan , titarchuk , & griffiths 2006 ; mucciarelli et al .",
    "luminous sources  # 24 , 41 , 47 and 49 are all associated with either young star clusters or bright starforming complexes .",
    "these ulxs are potential imbh systems , which have been discussed in sections 3.4.4 , 3.4.7 , 3.4.8 and 3.4.9 , respectively .    from the comparison of x - ray luminosities of ulxs detected in ngc  5775 during the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations , we find that s41 and s47 varied at the most by less than a factor of two . on the other hand , s24 , s28 , s40 and s49 displayed dramatic variations .",
    "both these two types of ulxs may form in starforming environments that have sub - solar metalicities .",
    "we have already seen that the diffuse gas in the starburst galaxy ngc  5775 is composed of sub - solar materials . as a result of this",
    "the newly - formed massive stars in the disk of ngc  5775 may leave more massive compact remnants than is typical for solar - metallicity stars .",
    "the combination of more massive black holes and more massive companions can lead to more luminous and longer - lived x - ray emission once mass transfer begins via a stellar wind or through roche lobe - filling .",
    "wind - fed binaries will steadily emit x - rays over long time .",
    "however , roche lobe - fill systems will display dramatic variations both in fluxes and spectra .      from our chandra survey of ulxs",
    ", we found a correlation between the observed number of ulxs per galaxy ( n@xmath104 ) and the far infrared luminosity ( l@xmath62 ) .",
    "in addition we have also found that the observed number of ulxs per galaxy and the nearest neighbor distance are anti - correlated ( swartz et al . 2004 ) .",
    "this means that the observed number of ulxs in interacting / merging galaxies strongly depends on l@xmath62 . however , brassington et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found a weak correlation between n@xmath104 and l@xmath62 of five interacting / merging galaxies .",
    "instead , they found that l@xmath104 , determined following the prescriptions of colbert et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , is relatively better correlated with l@xmath62 of the same five galaxies .",
    "it may be mentioned that such a correlation is obviously expected because the value of l@xmath104 strongly depends on l@xmath62 ( colbert et al .",
    "thus , we decided to study the relation between n@xmath104 and l@xmath104 using the cartwheel ( am 0035 - 335 ) , m82 ( ngc  3034 ) , ngc  3256 , arp  270 ( ngc  3395/3396 ) , arp  299 ( ngc  3690/ic  694 ) , antennae ngc  4038/4039 ) , ngc  4485/4490 , the mice ( arp  242 , ngc  4676a / b ) , ngc 5194/5195 , ngc  5774/5775 , arp  220 ( iras 15327 + 2340 ) , and ngc  7252 , which are interacting / merging galaxies with elevated number of ulxs . to maintain uniformity ,",
    "we have analyzed all the archival data from chandra and xmm - newton observations and detected x - ray sources within the d@xmath6 isophotes of these galaxies .",
    "when the intrinsic luminosities of the x - ray sources are more than 10@xmath105  ergs  s@xmath1  in the 0.5 - 8.0  kev band , then those objects have been identified as ulx candidates .",
    "next , we computed the number of possible background agns within the d@xmath6 isophotes using the log(@xmath73)log(@xmath74 ) relation deduced from the _ chandra _  deep field south survey ( rosati et al .",
    "2002 ) . finally , we determined total ulxs per galaxy , which will be considered as n@xmath104 , after subtracting the background agns .",
    "l@xmath104 was computed using equation 4 of colbert et al .",
    "the values of l@xmath106 were derived using the the k - band apparent magnitude from 2mass and following the expression given in seigar ( 2005 ) .",
    "we have used galex data or the xmm - newton / om data in the uv1 and uv2 bands to determine the values of l@xmath107 and that for fir were derived using the 60 and 100  @xmath108 iras flux densities ( devereux & eales 1989 ) .",
    "fig 22 displays the plot of n@xmath104 versus log ( l@xmath104 ) and fitting gives a slope of 1.03 with a correlation coefficient of 0.34 .",
    "however , if we exclude the cartwheel and arp  220 from fitting , then the slope changes to 1.38 with a correlation coefficient of 0.83 .",
    "this fit is shown with the straight line in fig .",
    "22 and indicates that the number of ulxs per galaxy depends on l@xmath104 , which is a function of fir , near - ir and uv luminosities .",
    "this is an interesting result and suggests that the value of n@xmath104 depends not only on the sfr but also on the mass of the host galaxies ( colbert et al .",
    "it can also be seen from this figure that the large number of ulxs detected in the cartwheel may not be the true ulx population of this galaxy system .",
    "at least four to five sources are in excess compared to the expected value .",
    "detection of these four - five sources may be the result of source confusion .",
    "on the other hand a large number of ulxs are missing in arp  220 .",
    "these missing ulxs may be highly variable , which were below the detection level during the chandra observations of this galaxy .",
    "it is also evident from fig .",
    "22 that at least two to three ulxs are missing in ngc  5775 .",
    "this indicates that the two ulx candidates ( s18 and s23 ) marked as possible halo - objects of ngc  5775 , may really belong to this galaxy .",
    "finally , we conclude that the interacting / merging galaxies host comparable number of ulxs based on their mass and starformation rate .",
    "the number of nearby interacting galaxies that exhibit elevated number of ulxs is quite small , so the interacting galaxy pair ngc  5774/5775 is an important system in that regard .",
    "these two galaxies are connected through two bridges , which is shown in fig .",
    "the size of the image in fig .",
    "1 is 6.6@xmath25.8 that contains two galaxies , two bridges and adjacent fields in between .",
    "we have performed a multiwavelength study of the whole system and the main results are summarized as follows :    \\1 . in total forty nine x - ray sources were detected in the 6.6@xmath25.5 field . in this field",
    "we expect 3 background sources at or above the detection flux level of a ulx in ngc  5774/5775 , based on the log(@xmath73)log(@xmath74 ) relation deduced from the _ chandra _  deep field south survey ( rosati et al .",
    "however , two and three background agns were identified in this field from our optical spectroscopic and photometric studies , respectively .",
    "we have detected two sources on the two bridges and these two sources are expected to be hmxrbs .",
    "it is likely that interaction - induced starformation was triggered on the bridges and these hmxrbs were formed .",
    "other relatively faint x - ray population on the bridges can be detected with deeper x - ray observations . outside the d@xmath6 isophote of ngc  5775 but within the 6.6@xmath25.5 field we have detected two ulx candidates , s18 and s23 , which appear to be located on the bridges .",
    "however , their closeness to the d@xmath6 isophote of ngc  5775 indicate that they may be in the halo of this edge - on galaxy or at the interface of the bridge and the halo of ngc  5775 .",
    "in addition , we have detected another bright ( @xmath410@xmath7  ergs  s@xmath1 ) ulx , s25 , which is associated with a background galaxy sdss j145355.82 + 033431.8 at a redshift of 0.0953@xmath50.0002 .",
    "eight sources , excluding one agn , was detected in an extremely low starforming galaxy , ngc  5774 .",
    "x - ray population of this galaxy can not be explained using the universal xlf of hmxrbs proposed by grimm , gilfanov , & sunyaev ( 2003a ) .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that the x - ray source population of ngc  5774 consists of the older and the younger stellar populations , which are directly related to the mass and sfr of ngc  5774 ( colbert et al .",
    "2004 ; grimm , gilfanov , & sunyaev 2003b ) . on the other hand",
    "twenty four x - ray sources , excluding one agn , of the starburst galaxy ngc  5775 can be well described with the universal xlf formalism of grimm , gilfanov , & sunyaev ( 2003a ) .",
    "in fact , the xlf of ngc  5775 is consistent with that of other interacting galaxies .",
    "these results indicate that the interacting / merging galaxies have comparable numbers of luminous sources ( grimm , gilfanov , & sunyaev 2003a , b ; colbert et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "presence of agns were not detected from the optical spectra of the nuclei of ngc  5774 and ngc  5775 .",
    "in addition , no nuclear point sources were detected in the chandra images of these two galaxies suggesting that they do not host active nuclei .",
    "diffuse emission was not detected in ngc  5774 but single temperature sub - solar gas is present in ngc  5775 .",
    "the temperature of this gas ( @xmath40.3 kev ) is lower than that to the detected in other interacting galaxies ( @xmath40.5 kev ) .",
    "un - resolved x - ray sources contribute significantly to the diffuse emission of ngc  5775 .",
    "outflows / winds are detected in the hst / acs h@xmath8 image of ngc  5775 , which suggest that the gas in the central region of this starburst galaxy is being compressed to produce galactic winds .",
    "all these observed properties clearly demonstrate that ngc  5775 is in the beginning of the evolutionary process ( taniguchi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "excluding the background agns and the two ulx candidates in the halo of ngc  5775 , we have detected 10 ulx candidates within the d@xmath6 isophotes of ngc  5774 and ngc  5775 .",
    "interestingly , these 10 ulx candidates fall in three groups - ( i ) s01 , s12 , s28 and s40 do not have any optical counterparts and are powerlaw x - ray luminous sources with photon indices around 1.8 , ( ii ) s04 and s46 are having steep - powerlaw x - ray spectra and embedded in diffuse h@xmath8 emission , which are probably ionized nebulae , and ( iii ) s24 , s41 , s47 and s49 are hosted in either young star clusters or bright starforming complexes and all are flat - powerlaw x - ray sources .",
    "variable radio emissions from s47 and s49 are detected .",
    "ulxs candidates in the first group are believed to be stellar - mass black hole systems . among these four objects , s40 is the brightest ( @xmath410@xmath7  ergs  s@xmath1 ) with a possible 6.2 hr period and it varied at least by more than a factor of 500 .",
    "most likely it is a relativistically beamed ulx and may be similar to cygnus x-3 ( ghosh et al .",
    "formation of h@xmath8 nebulae around s04 and s46 could be due to energetic supernova explosions or to continuous inflation by jets .",
    "variability , high s / n spectra and optical morphology of the whole system will help to determine the nature of these two ulx candidates . finally , the four ulx candidates of the last group are potential imbh candidates",
    ". simultaneous radio and x - ray observations of these objects will be extremely useful to determine the mass of the accretors of these ulxs .",
    "number of ulxs in interacting / merging galaxies are correlated with the fir , k - band and uv luminosities of their host galaxies , suggesting that the formation and evolution of ulxs depend not only on the starformation rate but also on the mass of these galaxies .",

    "<S> a few nearby interacting galaxies are known that host elevated number of ultraluminous x - ray sources . here </S>",
    "<S> we report the results of a multiwavelength study of the x - ray source population in the field of the interacting pair of galaxies ngc  5774/5775 . </S>",
    "<S> a total of 49 discrete sources are detected , including 12 ultraluminous x - ray source candidates with luminosities above @xmath0  ergs  s@xmath1  in the 0.5    8.0  kev x - ray band . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray source positions are mapped onto optical and radio images to search for potential counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> twelve sources in the field have optical counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> optical colors are used to differentiate these sources , which are mostly located outside the optical extent of the interacting galaxies , as potential globular clusters ( 2 ) , one compact blue dwarf galaxy and quasars ( 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained optical spectra of two of the latter , which confirm that they are background quasars . </S>",
    "<S> we expect 3 background sources in the field of these two galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these results are used to determine the true x - ray population of these two interacting galaxies , which are connected with two bridges . </S>",
    "<S> two high mass x - ray binaries are detected on these two bridges suggesting their formation through the interaction - induced starformation episode .    </S>",
    "<S> ngc  5774 is an extremely low starforming galaxy with five x - ray sources plus three ultraluminous x - ray source candidates . </S>",
    "<S> observed x - ray population of this galaxy does not scale with the starformation rate alone but it may scale jointly with the mass of the galaxy and the starformation rate .    </S>",
    "<S> twenty four x - ray sources ( excluding the agn ) are detected in ngc  5775 . and its x - ray luminosity function is consistent with that of other interacting galaxies , suggesting that these galaxies have comparable numbers of luminous sources . </S>",
    "<S> no x - ray point source was detected at the center of this galaxy to a limiting luminosity of 3@xmath210@xmath3  ergs  s  @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> wind / outflow is detected from the central region of ngc  5775 . </S>",
    "<S> sub - solar diffuse gas with temperature @xmath40.31@xmath50.04  kev is present in this galaxy , which suggest that ngc  5775 is in the beginning of the evolutionary process .    </S>",
    "<S> twelve ultraluminous x - ray source candidates are detected within the d@xmath6 isophotes of ngc5774/5775 . </S>",
    "<S> several of them are highly variable x - ray sources that fall below the detection levels in one of two x - ray observations spaced 15 months apart . </S>",
    "<S> two ultraluminous x - ray sources are located in the halo of ngc5775 and one of theme is hosted in a globular star cluster . </S>",
    "<S> four of the remaining 10 candidates have powerlaw x - ray spectra with photon indices around 1.8 and are extremely luminous with no optical counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> one of these four objects is the brightest ( @xmath410@xmath7  ergs  s@xmath1 ) with a possible 6.2 hr period and it varied by more than a factor of 500 . </S>",
    "<S> two of the rest six ultraluminous x - ray source candidates are having steep - powerlaw x - ray spectra and are embedded in diffuse h@xmath8 emission , which are probably ionized nebulae . </S>",
    "<S> these nebulae could be due to energetic supernova explosions or to continuous inflation by jets . </S>",
    "<S> rest four ultraluminous x - ray source candidates are flat - powerlaw x - ray sources hosted in either young star clusters or bright starforming complexes . </S>",
    "<S> two of them are radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that the number of ultraluminous x - ray source candidates in interacting / merging galaxies are correlated with the fir , k - band and uv luminosities of their host galaxies , suggesting that the formation and evolution of ultraluminous x - ray sources depend not only on the starformation rate but also on the mass of their host galaxies . </S>"
