    "within the last few years , our knowlegde of the basic parameters which determine the past , present and future of the universe has improved significantly .",
    "thanks to the combined results from studies of the cosmic microwave backgrund , the large scale structure , big bang nucleosynthesis and distant supernovae , we now have strong evidence for a flat metric of spacetime ( spergel et al .  2003 and references therein ) . according to the observations ,",
    "73% of the mean density of the universe originate from dark energy , 23% are contributed by cold dark matter and only 4% by `` ordinary '' baryonic matter . in such a cosmology ,",
    "structure growth proceeds hierarchically , with small structures forming first in the early cosmic stages , followed by the successive build - up of larger structures via merger and accretion events .",
    "although the constituents of the dark energy and dark matter remain unknown , the @xmath6cdm or `` concordance '' cosmology has been a very successful tool for the interpretation of structures on mpc scales and beyond ( e.g. , peacock 2003 ) . on scales of individual galaxies , however , several discrepancies between observational results and theoretical predictions have been found , a prominent of which is the `` angular momentum problem '' .",
    "this term depicts the loss of angular momentum of the baryons to the surrounding dm halo , resulting in galactic disks within numerical simulations which are smaller than observed ( e.g. , navarro & white 1994 ) , however more recent studies made progress in this respect ( e.g. , governato et al .",
    "aiming at a quantitative test of the hierarchical scenario at the scale of individual galaxies , we performed an observational study which covers a significant fraction of the hubble time .",
    "for this purpose , we utilised scaling relations like the tully  fisher relation ( tfr , tully & fisher 1977 ) between the luminosity @xmath7 and the maximum rotation velocity @xmath5 of spiral galaxies .",
    "basically , this correlation can be understood as a combination of the virial theorem and the rotational stabilisation of late  type galaxies . by comparing local and distant spirals of a given @xmath5 , the luminosity evolution within the look ",
    "back time can be determined .",
    "since the maximum rotation velocity is a measure for the total ( virial ) mass of a disk galaxy ( @xmath8 , e.g.  van den bosch 2002 ) , the tf analysis relates the evolution of stellar population properties to the depth of the gravitational potential well .",
    "numerical simulations within cdm - dominated cosmologies have been successfully used to reproduce the observed slope of the local tfr , whereas the zero points were offset due to dark halos with too high concentrations ( e.g. , steinmetz & navarro 1999 ) .",
    "the tfr slope was predicted to remain constant with cosmic look ",
    "back time in such @xmath9-body simulations ; nevertheless the modelling of realistic stellar populations at sufficient resolution remains a challenge   typically , the masses of individual particles are of the order of @xmath10  @xmath11 .",
    "other theoretical approaches focussed more on the chemo  spectrophotometric aspects of disk galaxy evolution .",
    "for example , boissier & prantzos ( 2001 ) calibrated their models to reproduce the observed colors of local spirals .",
    "compared to these , the authors predicted higher luminosities for massive disks and lower luminosites for low  mass disks at redshifts @xmath12 .",
    "a similiar evolution was found by ferreras & silk ( 2001 ) . by modelling the mass  dependent chemical enrichment history of disk galaxies with the local tfr as a constraint",
    ", the authors found a tfr slope that increases with look  back time ( i.e. , for a parameterisation @xmath13 , @xmath14 increases with redshift ) .    in the last decade , many observational studies of the _ local _ tfr have produced very large samples with @xmath15 ( e.g. haynes et al .",
    "1999 ) , not only to derive the slope and scatter with high accuracy , but also to map the peculiar velocity field out to @xmath16kms@xmath17 ( e.g. mathewson & ford 1996 ) .",
    "other groups used spirals , partly with cepheid  calibrated distances , to measure the hubble constant .",
    "for example , sakai et al .  ( 2000 ) derived a value of @xmath18kms@xmath17mpc@xmath17 with this method .    at higher redshifts , robust measurements of rotation velocities",
    "become increasingly difficult , which is mainly for two reasons .",
    "firstly , because the objects are very faint . given a redshift of @xmath19 , the surface brightness at galactocentric radii of @xmath203@xmath21   where the regime of constant rotation velocity is reached   is typically @xmath22magarcsec@xmath23 .",
    "spatially resolved spectroscopy at this level has become feasible just with the generation of 10m - class telescopes .",
    "the second difficulty coming into play arises from the small apparent sizes of the galaxies , this issue will be described in detail in sect .  [ anakin ] .    a number of samples with 10 - 20 objects in the regime @xmath24",
    "have been observed to estimate a possible evolution in luminosity by comparison to the local tfr .",
    "the results of these studies were quite discrepant : e.g. vogt et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) found only a modest increase in luminosity of @xmath25 , whereas simard & pritchet ( 1998 ) and rix et al .",
    "( 1997 ) derived a much stronger brightening with @xmath26 .",
    "a more recent study of 19 field spirals by milvang - jensen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) yielded a value of @xmath25 and showed evidence for an increase of this brightening with redshift .",
    "it seems likely that some of these results are affected by the selection criteria .",
    "for example , rix et al .",
    "selected blue colors with @xmath27 , simard & pritchet strong [ oii ] emission with equivalent widths @xmath220 , while vogt et al",
    ".  partly chose large disks with @xmath28kpc .",
    "the two former criteria prefer late  type spirals , whereas the latter criterion leads to the overrepresentation of large , early  type spirals .",
    "additionally , due to the small samples , all these studies had to assume that the local tfr slope holds valid at intermediate redshifts   we will adress this topic again in sect .",
    "[ dis ] .    based on a larger data set from the deep groth strip survey ( koo 2001 ) with @xmath29 spirals in the range @xmath30 , vogt ( 2001 ) found a constant tfr slope and only a very small rest ",

    "the imaging was performed with the very large telescope ( optical bands ) and the new technology telescope ( near infrared bands ) .",
    "based on a catalogue with spectral types and photometric redshift estimates ( bender et al .",
    "2001 ) , we chose objects for follow  up spectroscopy which satisfied the following criteria : _ 1 ) _ late  type spectral energy distribution , i.e. , galaxies with emission lines , _ 2 ) _ total apparent @xmath38-band magnitude @xmath39 , _ 3 ) _ photometric redshift @xmath40 to ensure that at least the [ oii]3727 doublet falls within the wavelength range of the spectra , _ 4 ) _ disk inclination angle @xmath41 and _ 5 ) _ deviation between slit direction and apparent major axis of @xmath42 .",
    "the two latter constraints were chosen to limit the geometric distortions of the observed rotation curves .",
    "for some objects , however , these limits had to be exceeded during the construction of the spectroscopic setups .",

    "the seeing ranged between 0.4 and 1.0arcsec with a median of 0.74arcsec . in total , 129 late ",

    ", we also took hubble space telescope images of the fdf with the advanced camera for surveys using the f814w filter . to cover the complete fdf area ,",
    "a 2  @xmath36  2 mosaic was observed .",
    "the spectra of 113 galaxies were reliable for redshift determination . out of these ,",
    "73 objects eventually yielded maximum rotation velocities ( see next section ) and were covered by the hst / acs imaging ; these objects will be referred to as the fdftf sample in the following .",
    "they span the redshift range @xmath44 with a median of @xmath45 corresponding to look  back times @xmath46 with @xmath47gyr .",
    "this data set covers all spectrophotometric types from very early  type spirals ( sa or @xmath48 ) to very late  type galaxies ( sdm / im or @xmath49 ) .",
    "an analysis of the galaxies surface brightness profile profiles was conducted with the galfit package ( peng et al .",
    "2002 ) . to fit the disk component ,",
    "an exponential profile was used , while a potential bulge was approximated with a srsic profile . in the case of 13 fdftf galaxies ,",
    "the fit residual images and large fit errors indicated an irregular component that could not be approximated properly with a srsic law .",
    "the bulge  to  total ratios of these galaxies were assumed to be undefined .",
    "the @xmath50 ratios of the other 60 fdftf galaxies ( @xmath51 with @xmath52 ) confirm that the vast majority of these galaxies are disk - dominated .",
    "total apparent magnitudes were determined using the ` mag_auto ` algorithm of the source extractor package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) . for the computation of absolute @xmath4-band magnitudes",
    "@xmath53 , we used the filter which , depending on the redshift of a given object , best matched the rest ",

    "thanks to this strategy , the @xmath60-correction uncertainties @xmath61   usually a substantial source of error to the luminosities of distant galaxies   are smaller than 0.1@xmath3 for all types and redshifts in our sample . for the correction of intrinsic dust absorption , we followed the approach of tully & fouqu ( 1985 ) assuming a face  on ( @xmath62 ) extinction of @xmath63 .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the fdftf galaxies computed this way span the range @xmath64 .",
    "the spectra of 12 objects in our sample cover a wavelength range that simultaneously shows emission in [ oii]3727 , h@xmath65 , [ oiii]4959 and [ oiii]5007 at sufficient signal  to  noise to determine the equivalent widths .",
    "these lines can be used to estimate the gas - phase metallicity .",
    "we adopted the analytical expressions given by mcgaugh ( 1991 ) to compute the abundances o / h from the @xmath66 and @xmath67 parameters .",
    "since all the galaxies have @xmath68 , we assumed that they fall on the metal - rich branch of the @xmath66o / h relation .",
    "the galaxies have abundances @xmath69 .",
    "we will use these estimates to investigate the luminosity ",
    "metallicity relation in sect .",
    "we extracted spatially resolved rotation curves from the two  dimensional spectra by fitting gaussians to the emission lines stepwise along the spatial axis .",
    "line fits at any projected radius which , compared to the instrumental broadening ( fwhm@xmath71 ) , had very small ( fwhm@xmath72 ) or very large ( fwhm@xmath73 ) line widths were assumed to be noise and therefore neglected .",
    "the analysis of spatially resolved rotation curves from optical spectroscopy of _ local _ spiral galaxies is relatively straightforward .",
    "but in the case of distant galaxies with very small apparent sizes , the effect of the slit width on the observed rotation velocities @xmath74 must be considered . at redshift @xmath19 ,",
    "a scale length of 3kpc  typical for an @xmath75 spiral  corresponds to @xmath200.5arcsec only , which is half the slit width used in our observations .",
    "any value of @xmath74 is therefore an integration perpendicular to the spatial axis ( slit direction ) , a phenomenon which is the optical equivalent to `` beam smearing '' in radio observations .",
    "the seeing has an additional blurring effect on the observed rotation curves .",
    "if not taken into account , these two phenomena would lead to an underestimation of the _ intrinsic _ rotation velocities and , in particular , the _ intrinsic _ @xmath5 .",
    "we overcame this problem by generating synthetic rotation curves . for the intrinsic rotational law",
    ", we used a simple shape with a linear rise of @xmath74 at small radii , turning over into a region of constant rotation velocity where the dark matter halo dominates the mass distribution .",
    "alternatively , we also tested the so  called `` universal rotation curve '' shape ( persic et al .",
    "1996 ) , a parameterisation which introduces a velocity gradient in the outer regions of the disk which is positive for sub-@xmath76 objects and negative for objects much more luminous than @xmath76 . however , the results given here are not sensitive to the form of the intrinsic rotational law   see bhm et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for a detailed discussion of this topic",
    " and we therefore only use @xmath5 values determined with an intrinsic `` rise  turnover  flat '' shape here .    given the observed inclination , position angle and scale length of an object , the intrinsic rotation velocity field was constructed , fig .",
    "[ vf ] shows an example . in the next step of the simulation , the velocity field",
    "was weighted with the surface brightness profile .",
    "the effect of this was that , just like for the observed data , brighter regions contributed stronger to the rotation velocities in direction of dispersion than fainter regions ( the `` beam smearing '' effect ) .",
    "following the weighting , the velocity field was convolved with the point spread function to simulate the blurring due to seeing .",
    "finally , a `` stripe '' was extracted from the velocity field , with a position and width that corresponded to the slit used during the observations , and integrated perpendicular to the spatial axis .",
    "the results of the whole procedure was a synthetic rotation curve which introduced the same geometric and blurring effects as the corresponding observed rotation curve . by fitting the _ simulated _ rotation curve to the _",
    "observed _ rotation curve , we derived the intrinsic value of @xmath5 .",
    "four examples of observed rotation curves along with the best - fitting synthetic rotation curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ rcs ] .",
    "36 galaxies had to be rejected from the further analysis because the @xmath77 was too low to probe the regime of constant rotation velocity at large radii , or because the rotation curves were perturbated .",
    "four objects were reliable for the @xmath5 determination , but their positions were located outside the field  of  view of the hst / acs mosaic imaging .",
    "34 objects had curves with a high degree of symmetry and clearly reached into the `` flat '' regime , we consider these as high quality data .",
    "39 curves had a relatively small spatial extent or mild asymmetries , these will be referred to as low quality data in the following . in total , our kinematic data set thus comprises 73 late  type galaxies at a mean look ",
    "back time of @xmath205gyr .",
    "the objects span the range @xmath78 with a median of 129km / s ( high quality data only : @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) .",
    "in fig .  [ fdfpt ] , the maximum rotation velocities and absolute magnitudes of the distant fdftf galaxies are compared to the local @xmath4-band tully  fisher relation by pierce & tully ( 1992 ) : @xmath81 with a scatter of @xmath82 .",
    "note that , at variance with the original relation given by these authors , we have calibrated the zero point to a face - on extinction of 0.27@xmath3 to achieve consistency with the computation of the distant galaxies absolute magnitudes .",

    "we will utilise the pierce & tully sample here for the sake of comparability to intermediate ",
    "redshift tf studies in the literature which mostly have used this sample as a local reference .    on the average , the distant galaxies are overluminous with respect to their local counterparts",

    "high  metallicity galaxies at intermediate redshift agree relatively well with the local @xmath7@xmath90 relation , whereas low ",

    "it has to be ruled out that our result might be induced by an observational bias or a systematic error .",
    "e.g. , it is known that present ",
    "day spirals show a correlation between their tf residuals and broad  band colors ( e.g.  kannappan et al .",

    "( 1997 ) , we refer to our results presented in ziegler et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    in the following",
    ", we will address another three examples of tests we performed .",
    "these are related to the influence of the intrinsic rotation curve shape , the impact of the intrinsic absorption correction and the issue of galaxy - galaxy interactions .    to derive the intrinsic maximum rotation velocity ,",
    "we have assumed an intrinsic rotation curve shape with a linear rise of the rotation velocity at small radii which turns over into a region of constant rotation velocity at a radius that depends on the rest  frame wavelength of the used emission line . this shape is observed for kinematically unperturbated , massive ( @xmath101 ) local spirals ( e.g. , sofue & rubin 2001 ) .",
    "for galaxies of very high or very low masses , on the other hand , it is observed that even in the outer parts , most rotation curves have a velocity gradient . while the rotation velocity keeps rising beyond the `` turnover '' radius in very low  mass spirals , the velocity gradient in very high  mass spirals is negative .",
    "persic et al .  (",
    "1996 ) have used @xmath21000 curves of local spirals to derive a parameterisation that uses the luminosity of an object as an indicator for the rotation curve shape . to ensure that the observed tf offsets can not be attributed to a false assumption on the intrinsic rotational law",
    ", we have alternatively used this so  called `` universal rotation curve '' shape as input for the computation of our synthetic velocity fields .",
    "if we use the @xmath5 values derived this way to recompute the offsets from the local tfr , the luminosity evolution we find is smaller by only @xmath200.15@xmath3 at @xmath102km / s . since this is a very modest change of the offsets we found on the basis of the simple `` rise  turnover  flat''shape ( which have a median of @xmath103 at @xmath102km / s for the hq data )",
    ", we conclude that our results do not differ significantly between these two assumptions on the intrinsic rotation curve shape .",
    "similarly , we have tested whether a different approach to correct for the intrinsic absorption would have an effect on our results .",
    "all values given here were derived following tully & fouqu ( 1985 ) , i.e. , the amount of intrinsic absorption is assumed to depend only on the inclination of the disk .",
    "more recently , tully et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have found evidence that the dust reddening is   at least locally   stronger in high  mass spirals than in low  mass spirals . using their results",
    ", we have recomputed the absolute magnitudes of the fdftf galaxies . as a new local reference that is consistently corrected for intrinsic absorption following tully et al .",
    ", we adopted the sample of verheijen ( 2001 ) which is slightly steeper ( slope @xmath104 ) than the pierce & tully ( 1992 ) sample .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that fast rotating , high  mass spirals are assumed to have a larger amount of intrinsic absorption than in the tully & fouqu approach , and vice versa in the low  mass regime .",
    "the offsets of the fdf high quality data from the verheijen tfr are however very similar to the initial values ( @xmath105 vs. @xmath103 at @xmath102km / s ) . with respect to the two conventions of intrinsic absorption correction discussed here , the tf offsets therefore are robust .",
    "a third aspect we want to focus on here concerns the interplay between the stellar population properties and the environment . from studies in the local universe",
    ", it is known that galaxies residing in close pairs can be subject to tidal interactions which can increase the star formation rates . in such cases ,",
    "the fraction of high  mass stars would be enlarged and , in turn , the mass  to  light ratio would be decreased , resulting in overluminosities in the tf diagram .",
    "this triggering of star formation would be particularly efficient in low ",
    "mass galaxies ( e.g. , lambas et al .",
    "though we have selected our objects from a sky region that should be representative for low  density environments , it is not clear a priori whether the correlation between the tf offsets and @xmath5 can at least in part be attributed to tidally induced star formation .",
    "based on @xmath210@xmath106 galaxies from the 2df survey , lambas et al .  have found that the star formation rates can be significantly increased in objects that have close companions with a separation @xmath107 km / s in systematic velocity and a projected distance of @xmath108kpc .",
    "using all 267 available spectroscopic redshifts of fdf galaxies at @xmath109 from our own study and a low  resolution survey presented in noll et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and adopting the lambas et al .",
    "constraints cited above , we have found 12 fdftf objects with confirmed neighbors .    in fig .",

    "though the small sub  sample of pair candidates does not allow robust statistics , the galaxies with close companions appear to be similarly distributed as the rest of the sample .",
    "moreover , we find a hint that the rotation curve quality is reduced with respect to the probably isolated galaxies   only 3 out of 12 ( 25% ) pair candidates were classified to have high quality rotation curves , whereas for the rest of the sample , this fraction is 31 out of 61 ( 51% ) . in particular , the pair candidates with hq curves are not systematically biased towards large overluminosities . since we have spectroscopic redshifts only for a fraction of the galaxies within the probed volume , it is possible that we missed some close pairs .",
    "however , the aim was to test whether those pair candidates which _ are _ identified systematically differ from the remaining fdftf objects .",
    "we thus conclude that our analysis which is based on the high quality rotation curves is very unlikely to be affected by tidally induced star formation .",
    "to summarise all the tests performed , we find no evidence for any systematic error or bias that may be the source of the observed shallow slope of the intermediate ",

    "divided according to the spectral energy distribution into early  type spirals ( sa / sb ) , intermediate  types ( sc ) and very late  types ( sdm / im ) .",
    "all three sub  samples show a correlation between the tf offsets and @xmath5 , but cover different mass regimes : galaxies with late  type spectra have smaller average @xmath5 values than early  type spirals .",
    "the respective classes have median values of @xmath110km / s , @xmath111km / s and @xmath112km / s . for samples which are too small to robustly test a correlation between @xmath87 and @xmath5 but",
    "can only be used to determine _ average _ tf offsets , this would results in a correlation between sed type and @xmath113 .",
    "studies comprising only 10 - 20 galaxies which were selected on blue colors or strong emission lines and therefore preferentially contained late  type spirals ( e.g. , rix et al .",
    "1997 , simard & pritchet 1998 ) , found evidence for large luminosity offsets at intermediate redshift with respect to the local tfr . according to the above",
    ", this can be attributed to a combination of a selection effect and small number statistics .",
    "similary , a study by vogt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) which was selected on large disks and therefore mainly contained early - type spirals ( which on average are more massive than late  types ) , yielded a modest value for the mean tf offset .    a more recent study on @xmath20100 intermediate  redshift spirals by vogt ( 2001 ) did not find evidence for a slope evolution of the tfr , at variance with our results",
    "moreover , this study yields only a modest average tf offset of @xmath1140.2@xmath3 , compared to the @xmath1140.8@xmath3 we find for the hq data ( note that these values correspond to the same cosmology and similar redshifts ) .",
    "it is difficult to speculate whether this could be attributed to different criteria of rotation curve quality or differences in the @xmath5 derivation procedures . on the other hand ,",
    "a sample of 64 galaxies drawn from the same survey ( the deep project , see koo 2001 ) finds , in comparison to local galaxies , a tilt of the intermediate - redshift luminosity ",
    "metallicity relation which is also indicated by our data ( fig .",
    "[ lz ] ) .",
    "is is a complicated issue to determine the key processes which can give rise to the mass  dependent tf offsets we observe .",
    "several effects likelywise act in combination when local and distant spirals are compared .",
    "e.g. , the stellar populations of the intermediate  redshift galaxies are probably younger than those of their local counterparts , the gas mass fractions and chemical yields also evolve with time etc .",
    "since even a relatively small fraction of young , high  mass stars can have a significant effect on the luminosity in the blue bands , a straightforward interpretation would be that the tf offsets of the fdf galaxies point towards a correlation between mass and _ age_.    as a first deeper insight into this matter , ferreras et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have used single  zone models of chemical enrichment on a sub  sample of the fdftf galaxies at @xmath115 .",
    "these models were determined by only four free parameters : formation redshift , gas infall timescale , star formation efficiency and gas outflow fraction .",
    "model star formation histories were generated which , combined with the latest bruzual & charlot models ( 2003 ) , were used to compute simulated @xmath35 broad - band colors . probing a large volume in parameter space ,",
    "these synthetic colors were fitted to the observed broad - band colors , thus deriving the four model parameters for each of the @xmath115 fdf galaxies . the best ",
    "fitting models indicated that high  mass galaxies on the average have higher star formation efficiencies , with a `` break '' at @xmath116km / s which   for reasonable @xmath117 ratios   interestingly is good agreement with the results found by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for _ local _ galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey .    moreover , the best  fitting formation redshifts of the ferreras et al .",
    "models were found to be higher for the more massive fdftf galaxies than for low  mass galaxies .",
    "the models hence yielded evidence that high  mass spirals started to convert their gas into stars at earlier cosmic epochs and on shorter timescales than low  mass ones . when evolved to zero redshift , the mean model stellar ages turned out to be older in high  mass galaxies than in low  mass galaxies .",
    "these results hint towards an _ anti  hierarchical evolution _ of the stellar ( baryonic ) component , a phenomenon that recently has been referred to as `` down - sizing '' ( e.g. , kodama et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "it is however improbable that this implies a contradiction to the hierarchical growth of the cold dark matter halos . in fig .",
    "[ fdfvsr ] , we show the offsets @xmath118 of the fdftf galaxies with high quality rotation curves from the local velocity  size relation ( which we presented in fig .",
    "[ vsr ] ) as a function of _ redshift_. given their maximum rotation velocity , distant galaxies with @xmath119 have disks that are smaller than in the local universe , while the disks of galaxies with @xmath120 are larger . though the scatter in @xmath118 is substantial , we observe a slight trend towards smaller disk sizes at higher redshifts .",
    "this is in compliance with the results from other observational studies ( e.g. , giallongo et al .",
    "2000 , ferguson et al .",
    "moreover , as is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fdfvsr ] , the fit to the data is in relatively good agreement with the prediction of disk growth in the hierarchical scenario ( e.g. mo et al .  1998 ) .    on the one hand , we find that the observed luminosity evolution of the fdf galaxies deviates from the results of simulations which were used to predict the tfr of distant spirals . on the other hand , the intermediate ",
    "redshift disks are observed to be smaller than locally , which is in compliance with the cdm hierarchical scenario .",
    "the results from single ",
    "zone models might indicate that the star formation is suppressed in low ",
    "mass galaxies due to , e.g. , sn feedback ( cf .",
    "dalcanton et al .",
