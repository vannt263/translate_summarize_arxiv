    "according to the shell - correction method ( scm ) @xcite , the oscillating part of the total energy of a finite fermion system , the so - called shell - correction energy @xmath1 , is associated with an inhomogeneity of the single - particle energy level distributions near the fermi surface .",

    "therefore , the stability of this system varies strongly with particle numbers and parameters of the mean - field potential and external force .",
    "a semiclassical periodic orbit theory ( pot ) of shell effects@xcite was used for a deeper understanding , based on classical pictures , of the origin of nuclear shell structure and its relation to a possible chaotic nature of the dynamics of nucleons .",
