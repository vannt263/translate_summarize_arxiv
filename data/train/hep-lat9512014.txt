    "the discretized approach of 2d quantum gravity , implemented by the matrix model , exhibits , in a continuum limit the same behavior as the continuous approach , given by the liouville field theory .",
    "thus it is certain that the two theories describe the same physics .",
    "however , we feel that the mutual relationship is not yet fully understood . while the relation between dt and matrix model is transparent , its relation to the liouville field theory is not so evident .",
    "intuitively , we expect that the simplicial manifolds generated by dt will tend to continuous manifolds in the large number limit of simplexes . however , such surfaces are known to be fractal@xcite , hence the way the lattice regularization simulates the continuous theory is not at all clear .",
    "it is therefore indispensable to make sure that an universal continuum limit exists . in order to check this numerically",
    ", we propose to measure how the network conducts currents , and compare it with the corresponding continuous medium .",
    "an invariance under local scale transformation plays an essential role in the algorithm , and because of this property we can extract information about the complex structure which is independent of the conformal mode parametrised by moduli .    despite many theoretical developments the precise nature of the transition at @xmath0 is still not fully understood .",
    "serious numerical efforts have failed so far to convincingly establish the transition , at least by measuring the string susceptibility .",
    "it should be much easier to observe this transition in local scale invariant quantities , rather than in the original metric which is comparatively complicated reflecting the fractal nature of the surface . here",
    ", we show such a method by which we can define the complex structure of a dt surface and separate the conformal mode .",
    "the basic idea of our method originates from the analog model @xcite of the dual amplitude in analogy with the electrical circuit@xcite .",
    "let us first consider a two dimensional conducting medium with conductivity tensor density @xmath2 .",
    "ohm s law reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an electric field and @xmath5 is a current density .",
    "the joule heat @xmath6 can be estimated by a potential distribution @xmath7 on the surface ; @xmath8 . requiring @xmath9",
    ", it leads to an equation for @xmath7 : @xmath10 , which is just the equation of continuity . for a homogeneous isotropic medium",
    "the conductivity tensor density is given by @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the resistivity constant .",
    "therefore , ohm s law([eq : ohm_law ] ) is invariant under the local scale transformation @xmath13 . in the following we first give an algorithm to measure the resistivity from voltage distribution . in the case of spherical topology",
    "we can regard the surface essentially as an infinite flat sheet .",
    "then the potential at a point specified by the complex coordinate , @xmath14 , with a source of current @xmath15 placed at @xmath16 , and a sink of the current at @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 in order to avoid the ambiguity arising from const .",
    "in eq.([eq : v(z ) ] ) we measure the potential drop between coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we define the potential drop between points @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the presence of a source and a sink of current at points @xmath23 and @xmath24 by @xmath25| , \\label{eq : potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26={z_i - z_k \\over z_i - z_l } { z_j - z_l \\over z_j - z_k}$ ] is known as the anharmonic ratio .",
    "it has an important property : _ i.e. _ @xmath27 invariance .",
    "then it allows us to fix three coordinates among the @xmath28 to any desired values without changing the potential drop eq.([eq : potential ] ) .",
    "for example , we can fix three coordinates as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "then the potential drop eq.([eq : potential ] ) for @xmath32 is written as @xmath33 @xmath34 all the other possible permutations of @xmath35 only give the potential drops obtained by linear combinations of eq.([eq : potd1 ] ) and eq.([eq : potd2 ] ) . since unknown variables are @xmath36 , we need the potential drop at an additional point @xmath37 .",
    "then we get three more relations in addition to eq.([eq : potd1 ] ) and eq.([eq : potd2 ] ) which altogether are sufficient to specify five unknowns : @xmath38 .",
    "the three extra equations are given by @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 now we apply this to a random surface generated by dt .",
    "since the local scale invariance is not fully realized on this surface , the resistivity may have certain fluctuations .",
    "in fact , the value varies from one sample to another , and depending on the position of electrodes for the measurements .",
    "such ambiguities should , however , vanish in the continuum limit , if it exists at all .",
    "the dual graph of a surface consisting of @xmath42 triangles is regarded as a trivalent network , where we fix the resistance of the link connecting two neighbouring vertices to be @xmath43 .",
    "what we want to do is to examine whether such a network behaves like a continuous medium in the limit of @xmath44 . for the measurement",
    "we pick five vertices in the dual graph and perform the method as explained above .",
    "the practical method we employ for the determination of potential drops is as follows ; we pick two vertices at @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the source and the sink of current with unit intensity . by writing the potential of the vertex",
    "@xmath47 as @xmath48 , current conservation reads @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the three neighboring vertices of @xmath47 .",
    "we solved this set of equations by the _ successive overrelaxation _ method .",
    "our method can be reconsidered from the string - theoretical point of view . whether string theory can be described by local fields or not is one of the fundamental questions .",
    "the authors of @xcite showed that a sum of planar fishnet feynman diagrams with @xmath42 external particles is indeed approximated by a @xmath42 particle veneziano amplitude .",
    "the basic assumption of this model is that the network corresponding to a fine planar fishnet feynman diagram can be regarded as a homogeneous isotropic conducting sheet with a constant resistivity .",
    "once this is accepted it is straightforward to derive dual amplitudes by evaluating the heat generated by the sheet .",
    "the purpose of our article is to justify this basic assumption numerically . in order to clarify the correspondence to the network of resistors ,",
    "we write the amplitude of fishnet feynman diagrams as @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath24 and ( @xmath54 ) indicate a link and its two ends(vertices ) of the network respectively , and @xmath55 here we have introduced a feynman parameter @xmath56 resistance ) , ( @xmath57 voltage at i ) , ( @xmath58 current through l ) and ( @xmath59 heat generation ) . ] for each propagator @xmath24 in the momentum integration , @xmath60    the basic conjecture is that the fishnet diagrams behaves as a continuum homogeneous conducting sheet after taking the average @xmath61",
    "we fix the topology to be two sphere(@xmath62 ) and the number of triangles to be @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( prohibiting tadpole and self - energy diagrams ) . for matter fields coupled to gravity we put @xmath66 scalar fields with @xmath67 and @xmath68 and/or ising spins on each triangle .",
    "we pick - up five vertices randomly as five electrodes to obtain the resistivity constant as indicated in sec . 2 , and repeat this procedure @xmath69 times for each configuration , for about @xmath70 independent configurations as ensembles .",
    "let us first take a look at the results for pure gravity ( fig.[fig : pure_resist ] ) .",
    "we find that _ peaks get narrower as the size grows_. the value @xmath71 should be compared to @xmath72 of the flat network(@xmath73 a honeycomb lattice ) .",
    "an increase in @xmath12 is understood to be a reflection of the fractal nature of the surface .",
    "as the surfaces get larger , finite size effects due to the discreteness diminish and eventually the peak will grow indefinitely .",
    "this is what we have expected as the continuum limit of a network of resistors .",
    "we find similar tendency in the one scalar case(@xmath74)(fig.[fig : b1_resist ] ) .",
    "also , in fig.[fig : random_resist ] , we show data to justify the assumptions of the analog model for the case of pure gravity .",
    "each resistance is distributed randomly with weight @xmath75 .",
    "these distributions indicate the same behavior with previous cases @xmath76 . in fig.[fig : b2_resist],[fig : b3_resist ] we plot the distributions of @xmath12 for the @xmath77 cases . here",
    "no sharpening of peaks with increasing sizes is seen unlike the previous cases , which suggests that the surface does not approach a smooth continuum limit .",
    "this is considered as the reflection of the tachyonic mode instability in the continuous theory .",
    "the same tendency is also supported in the case of 3 critical ising spins .",
    "next , we discuss how to extract information on the conformal mode .",
    "once we have found the value of resistivity , we can assign a complex coordinate to each vertex of the dual graph from eq.([eq : potd1 ] ) and eq.([eq : potd2 ] ) . in fig.6",
    "we plot the distribution of coordinates for all the vertices of a surface for the case of pure gravity with @xmath78 triangles .",
    "the point density around a point @xmath14 should be proportional to @xmath79 , because each vertex is supposed to carry the same space - time volume . in the conformal gauge which we have been employing",
    ", we have @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the conformal mode .",
    "this argument may be over - simplified in the sense that we did not pay attention to the quantum fluctuation of @xmath81 and the renormalization of the composite operator @xmath82 .",
    "what we can say safely is that the point density at @xmath14 after taking an ensemble average should be equal to the four - point function @xmath83 in the liouville theory , where @xmath84 is a point on the complex plane and @xmath85 is the renormalization factor for the conformal mode . in a recent paper@xcite ,",
    "an estimate for this four - point function has been given .",
    "this should be compared with fig.6 .",
