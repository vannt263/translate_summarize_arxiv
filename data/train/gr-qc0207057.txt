    "the point is that the quantity @xmath2 , which defines the travel time , and the quantity @xmath3 measured by the parallax , in general relativity ( in contrast with special relativity ) are not the same , even though , duly defined , they both deserve the name ` distance ' . in practice ,",

    "this may be an exploratory expedition , ( when only the time of return matters ) , or a regular space service between two stars .",
    "it seems interesting from both academic and practical points of view to find out whether something like a shortcut can be found in nature or manufactured by an advanced civilization .",
    "referring to an advanced civilization i mean that we are not concerned with ` technical details ' such as : how to create a wormhole , how to penetrate a domain wall , etc . at this stage of research",
    "almost any spacetime may be acknowledged as being possible unless it clearly contradicts some fundamental laws or observations .",
    "it appears , however , that even by such liberal criteria the existence of shortcuts is questionable .",
    "as was shown in @xcite maintaining an alcubierre bubble 100@xmath1 m in diameter involves energies of the order of @xmath34 . a similar result",
    "was obtained in @xcite for the krasnikov tube and , as we argue below , can be , analogously obtained for a traversable wormhole as well .",
    "such a figure looks absolutely discouraging even with regard to an extremely advanced civilization and can be viewed as a prohibition of shortcuts .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that it is not impossible to get around this prohibition .",
    "this will be shown in section  [ sec : ways ] after a brief discussion  in section  [ sec : restr ]  of the origin and meaning of that awesome figure .",
    "the root of the problems involved in creating a shortcut lies in the fact that , as was shown in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for wormholes , alcubierre s bubble , and krasnikov s tube , respectively , the weak energy condition ( wec ) @xmath35 must break down in some regions of these spacetimes .",
    "when the _ classical _ einstein equations are adopted the violation of wec implies that for some observers the energy density @xmath36 in those regions is negative , which is forbidden .    that a shortcut requires negative energy is hardly surprising ",
    "if the energy density were non - negative everywhere one would expect the total mass of the shortcut to be positive , while in fact it is zero by definition .",
    "hence an important question arises : is the necessity of negative energy densities something inherent in superluminal travel , or is it just an artifact of our approach , in which the spacetime outside some region is required to be _ strictly _ flat and thus the gravitational fields of stars , nebulae , and other potential sources of the energy needed for the trip are neglected .",
    "it is instructive to compare the notion of a shortcut with its alternatives .",
    "consider a group of runners .",
    "the starting line and the finish line taken , respectively , at the moments , when the race begins and when the first runner finishes , are spacelike geodesics .",
    "we recognize a runner as the fastest if he or she is the only one whose world line intersects both these geodesics .",
    "olum proposed @xcite to use the same criterion to distinguish a ` fastest ' null geodesic , which he calls superluminal ( see also @xcite ) . more specifically a null geodesic @xmath37 connecting points @xmath38 and @xmath39 is called superluminal ( in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional case , which is easier to visualize ) only if there are geodesics @xmath40 and @xmath41 such that of all their points only @xmath38 and @xmath39 are causally connected . and it is proved in @xcite that if the generic condition holds on @xmath37 , then wec does not .",
    "the advantage of olum s definition ( or , rather , part of the definition , since only a necessary condition is formulated ) is that one does not need compare objects and quantities belonging to different spacetimes . on the other hand",
    ", it excludes some paths which ( on the same intuitive grounds ) one might want to consider as superluminal .",
    "suppose , for example , that @xmath42 is the line @xmath43 , @xmath44 in a shortcut @xmath9 ( the coordinates are pulled back by @xmath45 from the minkowski space ) and that the photons emitted from this line move with a constant @xmath46 and meet the plane @xmath47 in points @xmath48 .",
    "now , according to olum , if @xmath49 has a _ strict _ minimum ( in @xmath50 , say ) , it qualifies the geodesic emitted in @xmath51 as being superluminal , but not if the minimum is weak ( which , for example , is the case with a ` portal ' ( see subsection  [ subs : portal ] ) , or an alcubierre bubble if its front wall is flatten ) .",
    "a different approach is proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the travel time @xmath52 in the real world @xmath53  with all its shortcuts ( if they are present there ) and with ( possibly non - trivial ) interaction between the spaceship and its environment  is again compared with the travel time @xmath54 in some fictitious spacetime @xmath55 . this time ,",
    "however , @xmath55 is not the minkowski space , but the spacetime that _ would have _ formed if the trip had not been undertaken . as an example ( for the rigorous definition and some discussion see @xcite ) ) consider a spherically symmetric spacetime which is empty outside a cylinder @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a ( 3-dimensional ) ball with the radius @xmath58 .",
    "let us interpret this spacetime as a model of a neighbourhood of a globular cluster . at @xmath43 an observer located in a point with @xmath59 decides to explore a star located in the diametrically opposite point and considers the following two scenarios .",
    "first , he / she can send a photon , which would pass through the cluster , reflect ( at @xmath60 , say ) from something near the desired star , pass through the cluster once again ( in the opposite direction ) , and , finally , return to @xmath61 .",
    "the other possibility is to send a spaceship instead of the photon .",
    "being powerful enough , the spaceship on its first passage through the cluster would push the stars , blow them up , emit different ( but all satisfying wec ) fields , etc . as a result",
    "the metric at @xmath60 in this second scenario differs from that in the first ( though , if the spherical symmetry is preserved by the pilot , it may remain , say , schwarzschild , outside @xmath62 ) .",
    "so , it is not surprising that the back way  and thus the whole trip  takes different time ( @xmath54 and @xmath52 , respectively ) for the photon in the first scenario and for the spaceship in the second . and if @xmath63 such a trip deserves to be called superluminal .",
    "a superluminal , in this sense , journey does not require violation of wec . in the appendix",
    "we prove this fact ( though actually it is almost self - evident ) by constructing a specific example .",
    "the problem with this example is that @xmath52 in it , though being less than @xmath54 , is still greater than @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the time required for the same trip in the minkowski space ( by the ` same ' trip i mean the trip between the points with the same @xmath66 , and @xmath67 coordinates ; due to the spherical symmetry and staticity of @xmath55 and @xmath68 such a mapping on the minkowski space is more or less meaningful , see @xcite though ) .",
    "so one can interpret @xmath69 to be not so much a gain in travel time as some compensation of the time delay @xmath70 experienced by a traveler in @xmath55 and caused by the variation of @xmath55 from the minkowski space .",
    "since the classical matter ( alone ) can not sustain a shortcut we turn our attention to the quantum effects  described within the semiclassical approximation @xcite  and , correspondingly , cast the einstein equations into the form @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the contribution of the ` classical matter ' , that is the matter for which quantum effects can be neglected .",
    "@xmath73 is supposed to obey the weak energy condition , but is otherwise arbitrary . as for the second term",
    ", it is the ( renormalized ) expectation value of the stress - energy tensor of quantum fields involved .",
    "as is well known @xmath74 may violate wec and so the necessity of negative energy densities does not by itself exclude the shortcuts .",
    "it was found , however ( see @xcite for a review ) , that such violations are not arbitrary , but may be subject to a restriction called the quantum inequality ( qi ) .",
    "the remainder of this subsection is a ( very sketchy ) review of how qi in its turn imposes restrictions on shortcuts .",
    "consider the free electro - magnetic or scalar ( massless , minimally - coupled ) field in the minkowski space .",
    "let @xmath75 be its energy density averaged with a weighting function @xmath76 over a timelike geodesic @xmath77 @xmath78 ( @xmath79 is the proper time on @xmath37 and @xmath80 ) .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath81 is smooth , its integral is unity , and its support lies in @xmath82 , so that , when @xmath83 is small , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the energy density of the field as measured by an observer with the world line @xmath37 .",
    "this equality allows one to estimate the energy density , because @xmath75 obeys the following _ ` quantum inequality ' _",

    "assume now ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that is valid also in _ curved _ spacetime if @xmath83 is sufficiently small , or , more specifically @xcite , if the following holds ( actually , one more inequality is implied , see the next section ) @xmath89 where the components of the riemann tensor are found in the observer s proper frame .",
    "the condition is supposed to guarantee that the relevant segment of @xmath37 lies in a region so small that it can be regarded as ` approximately minkowskian ' .",
    "the quantum inequality [ allowing for and ] relates the curvature in a point with the energy density in this point .",
    "it restricts , loosely speaking , the amount of ` exotic matter ' ( i.  e.  matter violating the weak energy condition @xcite ) that may be produced by the curvature of spacetime . but",
    "( almost ) the same quantities are related also by the einstein equations @xmath90 . ignoring in our rough consideration the possible difference between the scales given by the components of the einstein and of the riemann tensors",
    ", we can combine the two relations to obtain @xmath91 which , when @xmath92 is negative , gives @xmath93g/@xmath94 ) .",
    "indeed , let us estimate the total amount of negative energy @xmath0  required for maintenance of a shortcut .",
    "we define it as follows @xmath95 here we have chosen a spacelike surface @xmath96 in @xmath9 and denoted by @xmath97 the region within it in which wec is violated .",
    "@xmath0  is approximately equal to @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the volume of @xmath100 . in both alcubierre and krasnikov spaces",
    "@xmath100 is a spherical layer ( ` domain wall ' ) surrounding the domain @xmath101 of the ` false ' flat metric .",
    "the volume of the domain wall can be estimated as @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the area of its inner surface ( recall that as discussed in the introduction , the area of the outer surface is much greater , even though @xmath104 is small ) .",
    "@xmath101 must be at least @xmath105 m in diameter  which means that @xmath106  to accommodate a human .",
    "for a spherically symmetric wormhole , @xmath100 is essentially the throat of the wormhole , that is also a spherical layer with the radius @xmath107 m if a human being is supposed to pass through it .",
    "so , even if the thickness of the layer @xmath108 , one might conclude that it would take at least @xmath109 of exotic matter to support a shortcut .",

    "let us see , however , what restrictions on the parameters of the wormhole are imposed by qi .",
    "the maximal component of the riemann tensor in an orthonormal frame of a static observer located in the throat ( i.  e.near @xmath124 ) is @xmath125 correspondingly , qi ( [ eq : qi],[eq : supp ] ) requires that @xmath126 ( as we shall see in a moment , this is a _",

    "@xmath92 does not depend on @xmath79 for a so chosen observer and hence @xmath128 comparing this with the preceding inequality we find that @xmath129 , as expected , _ and _ @xmath130 .",
    "so , the frugality of the wormhole owes just to the fact that the thickness @xmath104 of the curved region is not of the order of @xmath131 ( as we took in deriving ) , but of the order of @xmath132 , which is a value , of course , that makes the wormhole much more absurd than benign .",
    "the analysis of the previous section leading to the restrictions and and to their interpretation is quite rough , of course .",
    "to some extent it can be refined , see @xcite , but , as we discuss in this section , significant loopholes remain .    in the search for realistic shortcuts",
    "an obvious line of attack would be to look for situations in which the quantum inequality does not hold .",

    "moreover , in their recent paper @xcite olum and graham showed that a system of two interacting scalar fields may violate .",
    "( it is especially interesting that the violation takes place _ near a domain wall_. one might speculate on this ground that perhaps the similarity of the shortcuts considered in the introduction with the domains of false vacuum has far - reaching consequences . )",
    "thus the inequality is , at least , non - universal .",
    "we shall , however , explore another possibility . in what follows",
    "we demonstrate that some ( perhaps most ) shortcuts are not excluded even if qi does hold .",
    "the derivation of rests heavily on the assumption that ( at least in @xmath100 ) the components of the riemann and the einstein tensors are roughly of the same order : in the key relation @xmath134 ( see the end of the chain ) the left hand side is determined by the former and the right hand side by the latter .",
    "physically this assumption means that the case is considered in which the exotic matter is generated mostly by the curvature produced by this same matter ( for a moment we ignore other possible mechanisms of generating exotic matter , such as mirrors ) .",
    "but the vacuum polarization in a point is determined ( among other things ) by the weyl tensor @xmath135 and not exclusively by the ricci tensor @xmath136 .",
    "in particular , the anomalous trace of the conformal scalar field is given @xcite by @xmath137 so , one expects to be true only when @xmath138 a condition that breaks down more often than not .",
    "for example , in _ any _ curved and empty region ( e.  g. in the vicinity of any star ) @xmath139 and relaxing the condition ( and hence ) one immediately removes the restriction and invalidates .",
    "another situation in which the quantum inequality does not imply and concerns wormholes .",
    "the point is that qi presumably holds for a sufficiently small @xmath83 because ` a curved spacetime appears flat if restricted to a sufficiently small region ' @xcite and hence the condition .",
    "a spacetime , however , may differ from the minkowski space in _ global _ properties .",
    "as is well known , @xmath92 is negative and constant ( in contradiction to ) even in a flat spacetime , if the latter is warped into a cylinder ( the casimir effect ) . to handle such situations",
    "it was proposed in @xcite to supplement with a requirement that @xmath140 be much less than ` the proper distance from the point @xmath141 to the boundary of the spacetime ' . in particular , if in a certain direction a condition of periodicity  of length @xmath142  is imposed on a field ( that is , a field on a cylinder , or , say , between mirrors is considered ) , then it is required that at least is imposed , where @xmath143 . ]",

    "finally , the boundaries are identified according to the following rule : each section @xmath152 of the left cylinder , which is a two dimensional sphere , is glued to the section @xmath153 of the right cylinder .",
    "the identification of the two spheres is performed so ( see figure  [ fig : worm]b ) that the segment @xmath154 , which lies in the @xmath155 plane and connects the spheres , becomes a circle .",
    "the spacetime @xmath146 describes a wormhole whose both mouths are at rest with respect to an inertial observer located in the minkowskian part of the shortcut ( i.  e.  in @xmath156 , see the definition of the shortcut ) .",
    "given such a wormhole it is relatively easy to impart a desired value of @xmath151 to it .",
    "all one needs is to move one of the mouths @xcite without changing the geometry of the throat ( and thus without spending much energy ) .    since shortcuts by definition",
    "must be globally hyperbolic we restrict ourselves to the spaces with @xmath157 ( lest the spacetime contain closed causal curves with all the ensuing complications @xcite ) . among these , @xmath146 with @xmath158 are most interesting .",
    "on the one hand , such a wormhole may be an efficient shortcut : to make a distant journey one acquires a wormhole with both its mouths initially located near the earth and takes one of them with him / her . moving at a high speed the traveler reaches",
    "the destination in a short ( proper ) time @xmath159 ( by this time @xmath160 becomes @xmath161 ) .",
    "the return trip is made through the wormhole and ( neglecting the time spent on traversing the wormhole ) the traveler returns to the earth in @xmath159 ( by the terrestrial clock ) after the departure .    and , on the other hand , such @xmath146 _ are free from the restrictions ( [ eq : est],[eq : plotn ] ) imposed by qi .",

    "note that @xmath142 , if desired , can be made _ arbitrarily _ small ( e.  g.  @xmath164 ) without any damage to the traversability of the wormhole : the radius of its throat and the distance @xmath160 between the mouths will remain macroscopic .",
    "moreover , by analogy with the casimir effect , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath92 in such a wormhole will be large ( @xmath165 ) , which would relieve one of having to seek additional sources of exotic matter .",

    "that is they describe the result of the following scenario : at some moment  say , at the big bang  a wormhole comes into existence .",
    "the non - flatness of the spacetime near the throat polarizes the vacuum and the term @xmath195 , if it is negative and large enough , supports the wormhole and prevents it from collapsing .",
    "if it fails , the wormhole begins to collapse and , correspondingly , the vacuum polarization increases .",
    "the process goes on until the equilibrium is ( hopefully ) found and the wormhole acquires the shape .",
    "how much energy this process requires is , of course , anybody s guess .",
    "remarkably , such solutions have @xmath187 oscillating in the throat ( i.  e.  at @xmath196 ) . to",
    "leading order it may have the form @xcite @xmath197\\ ] ] with @xmath198 , so the oscillations have exceedingly small magnitude and wavelength .",
    "the energy density of the field ( if found according to the semiclassical rules ) changes its sign with the sine and thus @xmath100 is a set of concentric spherical layers , each @xmath199 thick .",
    "therefore , as discussed above , one can hardly expect that @xmath0  defined by is something measurable .",
    "note , however , that it is quite different with the components of the metric : we can take @xmath180 in to be , say , of the order of @xmath200 and check that @xmath201 .",
    "thus the model contains quantities of two types  some are physically meaningful and trustworthy as long as we trust semiclassical gravity ( these , for example , are @xmath202 , @xmath203 , etc . ) , and the others are purely auxiliary , devoid of any specific physical meaning ( @xmath187 , @xmath0 , etc . ) .        in this section",
    "we show that in the case of a wormhole just by abandoning the spherical symmetry it is possible to reduce @xmath99 ( and thus @xmath0 ) drastically  by 35 orders in this case .",
    "the proposed wormhole also has another advantage : a traveler taking the short cut moves all the time in a flat region and need not plunge into the planck - density matter .",
