    "this work aims to be a conceptually self - contained introduction to the theory and applications of dendroidal sets , surveying the current state of the theory and weaving together ideas and results in topology to form a guided tour that starts with stasheff s work @xcite on @xmath3-spaces , goes on to boardman and vogt s work @xcite on homotopy invariant algebraic structures followed by the generalization @xcite of their work by berger and moerdijk , arrives at the birth of dendroidal sets @xcite and ends with the establishment , by cisinski and moerdijk in @xcite , of dendroidal sets as models for homotopy operads . with this aim in mind",
    "we adopt the convention of at most pointing out core arguments of proofs rather than detailed proofs that can be found elsewhere .",
    "we assume basic familiarity with the language of category theory and mostly follow @xcite . regarding enriched category theory we assume little more than familiarity with the definition of a category enriched in a symmetric monoidal category as can be found in @xcite . the elementary results on presheaf categories that we use can be found in @xcite .",
    "some comfort of working with simplicial sets is needed for which the first chapter of @xcite suffices .",
    "some elementary understanding of quillen model categories is desirable with standard references being @xcite .",
    "operads arose in algebraic topology and have since found applications across a wide range of fields including algebra , theoretical physics , and computer science .",
    "the reason for the success of operads is that they offer a computationally effective formalism for treating algebraic structures of enormous complexity , usually involving some notion of ( abstract ) homotopy . as such ,",
    "the first operads to be introduced were topological operads and most of the other variants are similarly enriched in other categories",
    ". however , the presentation we give here of operads treats them as a rather straightforward generalization of the notion of category .",
    "it is that viewpoint that quite naturally leads to defining dendroidal sets to serve as the codomain category for a nerve construction for operads , extending the usual nerve of categories .",
    "the path we follow is the following one .",
    "we first examine the expressive power of non - enriched symmetric operads .",
    "we find that by considering operad maps it is possible to classify a wide range of strict algebraic structures such as associative and commutative monoids and to show that operads carry a closed monoidal structure that , via the internal hom , internalizes algebraic structures . we show that the rather trivial fact that algebraic structures can be transferred along isomorphisms , which we call the isomorphism invariance property , is a result of symmetric operads supporting a quillen model structure compatible with the monoidal structure .",
    "we then turn to the much more challenging homotopy invariance property for algebraic structures in the presence of homotopy notions .",
    "we show how the theory of operads is used to adequately handle this more subtle situation , however at a cost .",
    "the internalization of these so - called weak algebras , via an internal hom construction , is lost .",
    "the sequel can be seen as a presentation of the successful attempt to develop a formalism for weak algebraic structures in which the internalization of algebras is restored .",
    "this formalism is given by dendroidal sets and a suitable quillen model structure which can be used to give a proof of the homotopy invariance property ( which is completely analogous to the case of non - enriched operads ) .",
    "the consequences and applicability of the added flexibility of dendroidal sets is portrayed by considering @xmath2-fold @xmath1-spaces and weak @xmath2-categories .",
    "section 2 introduces in the first half non - enriched symmetric operads and presents their basic theory .",
    "the second half is concerned with enriched operads and the berger - moerdijk generalization of the boardman - vogt @xmath4-construction .",
    "section 3 is a parallel development of the ideas in section 2 .",
    "the first half introduces dendroidal sets and presents their basic theory while the second half is concerned with the homotopy coherent nerve construction with applications to @xmath1-spaces and weak @xmath2-categories .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the cisinski - moerdijk model structure on dendroidal sets and the way it is used to prove the homotopy invariance property .",
    "section 5 closes this work with a brief presentation of a planar dendroidal dold - kan correspondence and discusses the yet unsolved problem of obtaining a satisfactory geometric realization for dendroidal sets .",
    "below we work in a convenient category of topological spaces @xmath5 . in some places",
    "it is important that this category be closed monoidal , in which case the category of compactly generated hausdorff spaces would suffice .",
    "we will not remark about such issues further .",
    "the author wishes to thank the referee for the diligent reading of an earlier version of this work and for the numerous helpful remarks and comments that helped shape the article .",
    "the reader already familiar with operads who reads this section just to familiarize herself with the notation is strongly advised to look at remark [ rem : to - distinguish - between ] and fact [ fac : iso invar ] below . for her convenience",
    "the opening paragraph below recounts the contents of the entire section .",
    "our journey starts with non - enriched symmetric operads , also known as symmetric multicategories ( originating in lambek s study of deductive systems in logic @xcite ) or symmetric coloured operads ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the literature on operads these structures are underrepresented probably due to the fact that the first operads , introduced by may in @xcite , were enriched in topological spaces and many of the most important uses of operads require enrichment .",
    "the point of view of operads we adopt is that operads generalize categories .",
    "consequently , just as a study of categories starts with non - enriched categories , with enrichment usually treated at some later stage , we first present non - enriched symmetric operads .",
    "the operadically versed reader will immediately recognize that our definition of algebra differs slightly from the standard one .",
    "we define the boardman - vogt tensor product of symmetric operads and the notion of natural transformations for symmetric operads that endows the category of symmetric operads with the structure of a symmetric closed monoidal category .",
    "we then address the isomorphism invariance property and treat it in the context of a suitable quillen model structure on symmetric operads .",
    "we then turn to the much more subtle and interesting case of the homotopy invariance property and give an expository treatment of the theory developed by berger and moerdijk relevant for the rest of the presentation .",
    "symmetric ( also called non - planar ) rooted trees are useful in the study of symmetric operads .",
    "there is no standard definition of tree that is commonly used ( ginzburg and kapranov in @xcite use a topological definition while leinster in @xcite uses a combinatorial one ) but all approaches are essentially the same .",
    "more recently , joachim kock in @xcite established a close connection between trees and polynomial functors , offering yet another formalism of trees while shedding a different light on the symbiosis between operads and trees .",
    "we present here the formalism of trees we use and introduce terminology for commonly occurring trees as well as grafting of trees .",
    "we end the section by presenting a generalization of posets that shows trees to be analogues of finite linear orders .",
    "a _ tree _ ( short for symmetric rooted tree ) is a finite poset @xmath6 which has a smallest element and such that for each @xmath7 the set @xmath8 is linearly ordered .",
    "the elements of @xmath9 are called _ edges _ and the unique smallest edge is called the _",
    "root_. part of the information of a tree is a subset @xmath10 of maximal elements , which are called _",
    "leaves_. an edge is _",
    "outer _ if it is either the root or it belongs to @xmath11 , otherwise it is called _ inner_.    given edges @xmath12 we write @xmath13 if @xmath14 and if for any @xmath15 for which @xmath16 holds that either @xmath17 or @xmath18 . for a non - leaf edge",
    "@xmath19 the set @xmath20 is called the set of _ incoming edges _ into @xmath19 .",
    "for such an edge @xmath19 the set @xmath21 is called the _ vertex _ above @xmath19 and we define @xmath22 and @xmath23 which are called , respectively , the set of _ incoming edges _ and the _ outgoing edge _ associated to @xmath24 .",
    "the _ valence _ of @xmath24 is equal to @xmath25 and could be @xmath26 .",
    "note that there is no vertex associated to a leaf . we will draw trees by the graph dual of their hesse diagrams with the root at the bottom and will use a @xmath27 for vertices .",
    "for example , in the tree@xmath28_{e } &   & * { \\,}\\ar@{-}[dl]^{f}\\\\ \\,\\ar@{}[r]|{\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , v } & * { \\bullet}\\ar@{-}[dr]_{b } &   & * { \\,}\\ar@{-}[dl]_{c}\\ar@{}[r]|{\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , w } & * { \\bullet}\\ar@{-}[dll]^{d}\\\\   &   & * { \\bullet}\\ar@{-}[d]_{r } & \\,\\ar@{}[l]^{u\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,}\\\\   &   & * { \\,}}\\ ] ] there are three vertices of valence 2,3 , and 0 and three leaves @xmath29 .",
    "the outer edges are @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , where @xmath31 is the root .",
    "the inner edges are then @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the following types of trees appear often enough in the theory of dendroidal sets to merit their own notation .    for each @xmath34 , a tree @xmath35 of the form@xmath36\\\\ * { \\bullet}\\ar@{ .. }[d]\\\\",

    "we denote this tree by @xmath39 , or @xmath40 if we wish to explicitly name its unique edge . in this tree ,",

    "@xmath2-corolla_. note that the case @xmath43 results in a tree different than @xmath39 .",

    "the _ grafting _ , @xmath45 , of @xmath44 on @xmath9 along @xmath31 is the poset @xmath46 with the obvious poset structure and set of leaves equal to @xmath47 .",
    "pictorially , the grafted tree @xmath45 is obtained by putting the tree @xmath44 on top of the tree @xmath9 by identifying the output edge of @xmath44 with the input edge @xmath31 of @xmath9 . by repeatedly grafting",
    ", one can define a full grafting operation @xmath48 in the obvious way .",
    "we now state a useful decomposition of trees that allows for inductive proofs on trees .",
    "the proof is trivial .",
    "let @xmath9 be a tree .",
    "suppose @xmath9 has root @xmath31 and @xmath49 is the vertex above @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath50 be the tree that contains the edge @xmath51 as root and everything above it in @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the n - corolla consisting of @xmath31 as root and @xmath54 as the set of leaves .",
    "the trees we defined above are going to be the objects of the category @xmath55 whose presheaf category @xmath56 is the category of dendroidal sets . recall that the simplicial category @xmath57 ( whose presheaf category is the category of simplicial sets ) can be defined as ( a skeleton of ) the category of totally ordered finite sets with order preserving maps . in this section",
    "we present an extension of the notion of totally ordered finite sets closely related to trees .",
    "the content of this section is not used anywhere in the sequel and is presented for the sake of completeness .",
    "consequently we give no proofs and refer the reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "first we extend the notion of a relation and that of a poset to what we call broad relation and broad poset .",
    "for a set @xmath58 we denote by @xmath59 the free commutative monoid on @xmath58 .",
    "a _ broad relation _ is a pair @xmath60 where @xmath58 is a set and @xmath61 is a subset of @xmath62 .",
    "as is common with ordinary relations , we use the notation @xmath63 instead of @xmath64 .",

    "reflexivity : @xmath65 holds for any @xmath66 .",
    "transitivity : for all @xmath67 and @xmath68 such that @xmath69 for @xmath70 , holds that if @xmath71 then @xmath72 .",
    "anti - symmetry : for all @xmath73 and @xmath74 if @xmath75 and @xmath76 then @xmath77 .    when @xmath60 is a broad poset we denote @xmath61 by @xmath78 .",
    "the meaning of @xmath79 is then defined in the usual way .",
    "a _ map _ of broad posets @xmath80 is a set function preserving the broad poset structure , that is if @xmath81 then @xmath82 .",
    "we denote by @xmath83 the category of all broad posets and their maps .",
    "let @xmath84 be a singleton set @xmath85 with the broad poset structure given by @xmath86 .",
    "note that @xmath84 is not a terminal object in @xmath83 .",
    "( slicing lemma for broad posets ) there is an isomorphism of categories between @xmath87 and the category @xmath88 of posets and order preserving maps . moreover , along this isomorphism one obtains a functor @xmath89 which has a right adjoint @xmath90 which itself has a right adjoint @xmath91 .    as motivation for the following definition recall that a finite ordinary poset @xmath58 is linearly ordered if , and only if , it has a smallest element and for every @xmath66 the set @xmath92 is either empty or has a smallest element .",
    "a finite broad poset @xmath58 is called _ dendroidally ordered _ if    1 .",
    "there is an element @xmath93 such that for every @xmath66 there is @xmath94 such that @xmath95 .",

    "the transitive closure of this broad relation is then a dendroidally ordered set .",
    "this constructions can be used to give an equivalence of categories between the full subcategory @xmath107 of @xmath83 spanned by the dendroidally ordered sets and the dendroidal category @xmath55 defined below .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath107 , upon slicing over @xmath84 , is isomorphic to the category of all finite linearly ordered sets and order preserving maps .",
    "we now present symmetric operads viewed as a generalization of categories where arrows are allowed to have domains of arity @xmath2 for any @xmath108 .",
    "we then define the notion of @xmath109-algebras for a symmetric operad @xmath109 which are often referred to as the raison dtre of operads .",
    "we deviate here from the common definition of algebras noting that our definition encompasses the standard one .",
    "we define an algebra to simply be a morphism between symmetric operads , the difference being purely syntactic .",
    "the assertion that symmetric operads exist in order to define algebras thus agrees with the idea that in any category the objects raison dtre is to serve as domains and codomains of arrows .",
    "a _ planar operad _",
    "@xmath109 consists of a class @xmath110 whose elements are called the _ objects _ of @xmath109 and to each sequence @xmath111 a set @xmath112 whose elements are called _ arrows _ depicted by @xmath113__. _ _ with this notation @xmath114 is the _ domain _ of @xmath115 , @xmath116 its _ codomain _ , and @xmath2 its _ arity _ ( which is allowed to be @xmath26 ) .",

    "furthermore , with the tensor product of dendroidal sets , this model structure is a monoidal model category . slicing this model structure recovers the joyal model structure on @xmath398 and in the diagram@xmath557^{j_{!}\\,\\,\\,}\\ar@<2pt>[d]^{n } & ope\\ar@<2pt>[l]^{j^{*}\\,\\,\\,}\\ar@<2pt>[d]^{n_{d}}\\\\ sset\\ar@<2pt>[r]^{i_{!}}\\ar@<2pt>[u]^{\\tau } & dset\\ar@<2pt>[l]^{i^{*}}\\ar@<2pt>[u]^{\\tau_{d}}}\\ ] ] where the categories are endowed ( respectively starting from the top - left going clock - wise ) with the categorical , operadic , cisinski - moerdijk , and joyal model structures all adjunctions are quillen adjunction ( and none is a quillen equivalence ) .            in the diagram defining the homotopy invariance property in definition [ def : homotop inv proper ] above the left vertical arrow",
    "is a trivial cofibration and the right vertical arrow is a fibration in the cisinski - moerdijk model structure and thus the required lift exists .    we now recall fact [ fac : iso invar ] regarding the internalization of strict algebras by the closed monoidal structure on @xmath136 given by the boardman - vogt tensor product and the isomorphism invariance property for such algebras as captured by the operadic monoidal model structure on @xmath136 .",
    "we recall that a similar such correspondence for weak algebras and their homotopy invariance property does not seem possible within the confines of enriched operads .",
    "we are now in a position to summarize the results recounted above in a form completely analogous to the situation of strict algebras .",
    "the notion of algebras of dendroidal sets is internalized to the category @xmath399 by it being closed monoidal with respect to the tensor product of dendroidal sets .",
    "the homotopy invariance property of @xmath271-algebras in an @xmath0-operad , for a normal @xmath271 , holds and is captured by the fact that @xmath399 supports the cisinski - moerdijk model structure which is compatible with the tensor product .",
    "the notion of a weak @xmath109-algebra in a homotopy environment @xmath194 , where @xmath109 is discrete , is subsumed by the notion of algebras in @xmath399 by means of the dendroidal set @xmath558 $ ] of weak @xmath109-algebras in @xmath194 .",
    "recall the iterative construction of the dendroidal set @xmath456 of @xmath2-fold @xmath1-spaces and @xmath559 of weak @xmath2-categories as well as @xmath485 of @xmath187-monoidal @xmath2-categories .",
    "it follows from the general theory of dendroidal sets that these are all @xmath0-operads . to see that , one uses theorem [ thm : exp ] together with the fact that for a @xmath560-free symmetric operad @xmath109 ( for instance if @xmath109 is obtained from a planar operad @xmath176 by the symmetrization functor ) then @xmath428 is normal .",
    "thus , weak maps of @xmath2-fold @xmath1-spaces can be coherently composed and similarly so can weak functors between weak @xmath2-categories . as for @xmath187-monoidal @xmath2-categories",
    "we note that @xmath485 is , for similar reasons as above , an @xmath0-operad as well .",
    "recall that @xmath562 $ ] and assume it is a strict @xmath0-operad .",
    "we wish to prove that @xmath563\\cong[a^{\\otimes n+2},wcat^{n}]$ ] for any fixed @xmath564 . by lemma [ lem : strict iff operad ]",
    "there is an operad @xmath109 such that @xmath565=n_{d}(\\mathcal{p})$ ] .",
    "we now have@xmath566=[a^{\\otimes j},[a^{\\otimes n},wcat^{n}]]=[a^{\\otimes j},n_{d}(\\mathcal{p})]\\ ] ] which by adjunction is isomorphic to @xmath567).$ ] however , @xmath58 is actually the dendroidal nerve of the symmetric operad @xmath242 classifying associative monoids . by proposition [ pro : tau of tensor ]",
    "we have@xmath568 and the result follows .",
    "all of the theory of dendroidal sets that directly or indirectly is concerned with algebras ( we include the cisinski - moerdijk model structure here as well ) is very operadic in nature and is closely related to the theory of @xmath0-categories modeled by quasicategories .",
    "simplicial sets are , however , also models for topological homotopy theory .",
    "indeed , simplicial sets were introduced in the context of algebraic topology as combinatorial models of topological spaces .",
    "the appropriate equivalence is established in @xcite and was the reason to introduce quillen model categories . to recall the main result recall the singular functor @xmath569 and its left adjoint @xmath570 given by geometric realization .",
    "the category @xmath5 supports a quillen model structure in which the weak equivalences are the weak homotopy equivalences and the fibrations are the serre fibrations . the category @xmath398 supports a quillen model structure in which the weak equivalences are those maps @xmath273 for which the geometric realization @xmath571 is a homotopy weak equivalence and the fibrations are the kan fibrations . with these model structures",
    "the adjunction above is a quillen equivalence .",
    "simplicial sets thus support a topologically flavoured quillen model structure as well as the joyal model structure which is categorically flavoured and so simplicial sets play two rather different roles . the close connection between dendroidal sets and simplicial sets raises the question as to the existence of a topologically flavoured interpretation of dendroidal sets as well .",
    "this problem is open for debate and interpretation and is certainly far from settled .",
    "we remark first that there is some indication that suggests dendroidal sets do carry topological meaning .",
    "recall the dold - kan correspondence that establishes an equivalence of categories between the category @xmath572 of simplicial abelian groups and the category @xmath573 of non - negatively graded chain complexes .",
    "this correspondence is useful in the calculation of homotopy groups of simplicial sets and in the definition of eilenberg - mac lane spaces @xmath574 for @xmath575 . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that there is a planar dendroidal version ( where one considers a planar version of @xmath55 whose objects are planar trees ) of the dold - kan correspondence .",
    "the equivalence is between the category @xmath576 of planar dendroidal abelian groups and the category @xmath577 of planar dendroidal chain complexes .",
    "the definition of the latter requires that for each face map @xmath500 between planar trees there is associated a sign @xmath578 such that the following holds . in the planar version of @xmath55",
    "it is still true that a face @xmath365 of codimension @xmath237 decomposes in precisely two ways as the composition of two faces ( see proposition [ pro : sub - faceofasub - face ] above ) .",
    "thus we can write @xmath365 as @xmath579 as well as @xmath580 and we require that @xmath581 .",
    "one may now wonder whether these dendroidal chain complexes give rise to some sort of generalized eilenberg - mac lane spaces .",
    "a first step towards answering this question should be a clearer specification of goals in a broad context , which is the aim of the rest of this section .    as inspiration",
    "we consider the quillen equivalence between topological spaces and simplicial sets mentioned above .",
    "the geometric realization plays there a prominent role and thus a significant aspect of understanding the homotopy behind dendroidal sets is to find a category @xmath582 together with functors @xmath583 and @xmath584 .",
    "the category @xmath582 of course has to be chosen with care so that it will rightfully be considered to be related to topology .",
    "we thus expect that there is a fully faithful functor @xmath585 with a right adjoint @xmath586 that should be defined purely topologically. we thus expect @xmath582 to be a category of some generalized topological spaces in which ordinary topological spaces embed via @xmath587 . to allow sufficient flexibility for working with these objects we expect that @xmath582 be small complete and small cocomplete . moreover ,",
    "the functor @xmath584 should send a dendroidal set @xmath271 to some generalized space @xmath588 in such a way that the combinatorial information in @xmath271 is not lost .",
    "we thus expect of any such functor @xmath589 that if for some @xmath273 the map @xmath590 is an isomorphism then @xmath175 was already an isomorphism .",
    "in other words we expect @xmath589 to be conservative .    the term purely topologically above is of course vague and open to discussion . in an attempt to formalize it recall the various slicing lemmas we have seen above :",
    "slicing symmetric operads over @xmath84 gives categories , slicing dendroidal sets over @xmath591=n_{d}(\\star)$ ] gives simplicial sets , and slicing @xmath55 over @xmath39 gives @xmath57 .",
    "we thus expect that there is an object @xmath592 such that slicing @xmath582 over @xmath84 gives a category equivalent to @xmath5 and that in fact the embedding @xmath585 is essentially the forgetful functor @xmath593 .",
    "moreover , noting that the ` correct ' tensor product of dendroidal sets is not the cartesian one we expect @xmath582 to posses a monoidal structure different from the cartesian product . and , just as the tensor product of dendroidal sets slices to the cartesian product of simplicial sets we expect the monoidal structure on @xmath582 to slice to the cartesian product of topological spaces .",
    "lastly , an important property of the ordinary geometric realization functor is that it commutes with finite products .",
    "we expect of the dendroidal geometric realization functor @xmath594 to be monoidal with respect to the non - cartesian monoidal structure on each category .        1 .",
    "@xmath582 is small complete and small cocomplete .",
    "2 .   ( slicing lemma ) @xmath596 is equivalent to @xmath5 .",
    "the forgetful functor @xmath585 is an embedding .",
    "4 .   slicing @xmath597 gives @xmath598 and slicing @xmath589 gives @xmath599 .",
    "@xmath589 is conservative .",
    "@xmath582 admits a non - cartesian monoidal structure that slices over @xmath84 to the cartesian product in @xmath5 ( along @xmath587 ) .",
    "the functor @xmath589 is to be a monoidal functor with respect to the tensor structures on @xmath399 and @xmath582 .",
    "we would thus obtain the diagram@xmath600^{|-|}\\ar@<-2pt>[d]_{i _ { ! } } & top\\ar@<2pt>[l]^{sing}\\ar@<-2pt>[d]_{h_{!}}\\\\ dset\\ar@<-2pt>[u]_{i^{*}}\\ar@<2pt>[r]^{|-|_{d } } & dtop\\ar@<2pt>[l]^{sing_{d}}\\ar@<-2pt>[u]_{h^{*}}}\\ ] ] where both squares commute .",
    "the quest will be complete with the establishment of quillen model structures on @xmath399 and @xmath582 that slice respectively to the standard ( topological ) ones on @xmath398 and @xmath5 and such that in the square above all adjunctions are quillen adjunctions with both horizontal ones quillen equivalences .          c. berger , i. moerdijk , _ resolution of coloured operads and rectification of homotopy algebras _ , categories in algebra , geometry and mathematical physics ,",
