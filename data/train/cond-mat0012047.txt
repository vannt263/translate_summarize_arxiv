    "a new field in the physics of x - ray diffraction has appeared and successfully developed during last 30 years .",
    "it is based on studying and using x - ray standing waves ( xsw ) that are formed in a perfect crystal under conditions of dynamical diffraction .",
    "apart from general physical interest involving the enormously sharp change in the interaction of x - rays with atoms in the crystal and on its surface , this field , as has now become clear , is highly promising for analyzing the structure of crystals and its adsorbates at the atomic level .",
    "actually a standing wave that has the same period as the crystal lattice is extremely sensitive to the slightest deviation of the atomic planes ( or individual atoms ) from their correct position in the perfect crystal ( or on its surface ) .",
    "thus xsw method is particularly useful in its application for structural analysis . for this technique , an x - ray interference field ( xif )",
    "is produced by the superposition of , typically , two plane x - ray waves . in this case",
    "we have the following expression for the amplitude of the electric field in the crystal : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an incident wave vector , @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the reciprocal lattice vector multiplied by @xmath4 the field intensity is determined by the square of the modulus of the amplitude @xmath5 and is equal to @xmath6 ,   \\label{c1.2}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the phase of the ratio @xmath8 .",
    "the spatial position of the planar wave field is determined by the phase @xmath7 between the two ( electric ) field amplitudes .",
    "generated via bragg reflection , employing a diffraction vector @xmath3 , the x - ray standing wave exists within the overlap region of the incident and reflected x - ray wave ( fig.1 ) and the phase @xmath7 and thus the position of the wave field is a function of the angle @xmath9 measured from exact bragg angle , varying by half a diffraction plane spacing within the total reflection range .",
    "thus , atomic positions can be scanned by the xif and exactly determined if the yield of the element specific photoelectrons or x - ray fluorescence photons is recorded as a function of the glancing angle .",
    "structural analysis by the xsw technique represents actually a fourier analysis but , in contrast to diffraction techniques , the _ atomic _ distribution of an _ elemental sublattice _ is sampled .",
    "the two important parameters which are determined by an xsw measurement are called coherent fraction ( @xmath10 ) and coherent position ( @xmath11 ) and represent the @xmath12th amplitude and phase , respectively , of the fourier decomposition of the distribution of atoms under consideration .",
    "the xsw method is particularly powerful for the analysis of the structure of adsorbates on crystalline substrates since the position of the adsorbate atom within the surface unit cell can be determined with high accuracy for low adsorbate coverages . in case several elements are present on the surface , @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be obtained for each elemental sublattice within one xsw measurement .",
    "an effect involving the existence of a standing wave and the variation of the total field at the atoms of the crystal lattice has been known for a long time ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however in the conditions of a classical x - ray diffraction experiment , when the intensity of the reflected and transmitted waves is measured separately it is manifested very weakly .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact , that the cross sections of the inelastic scattering channels are considerably smaller , than the cross section of elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "the standing wave in the crystal reveals itself in a traditional x - ray diffraction experiment only in the form of an anomalous angular dependence of the absorption ( the anomalous transmission effect in the laue case as discovered by borrmann @xcite ) and also the weak asymmetry of the reflectivity curve in the bragg case @xcite .",
    "batterman @xcite was the first who made an attempt to see the standing wave and its behavior by measuring the @xmath13 fluorescence emitted by crystal atoms . despite expectations , the measured curve has the angular dependence similar to the inverted reflectivity curve of the x - rays .",
    "the structure of the wave field manifested itself very weakly only at the edges of the total reflection region .",
    "it was soon understood @xcite , that this behavior was due to the fact , that the depth of yield @xmath14 of the fluorescence radiation exceeds by far the penetration depth of x - rays in the crystal .",
    "this penetration depth while the dynamical diffraction of x - rays is of the order of extinction length @xmath15 . as a result",
    "all the radiation absorbed in the crystal gives rise to a fluorescence signal .",
    "its amount , following the law of conservation of energy is equal to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the reflectivity curve .",
    "the secondary radiation ( sr ) yield is proportional to the wave field intensity ( [ c1.2 ] ) at the atoms only if the condition ( @xmath18 ) is fulfilled .",
    "later there were proposed methods for revealing the structure of the wave field by measuring the fluorescence yield from the impurity atoms introduced in the lattice of the crystal matrix at a very small depth @xcite or measuring the fluorescence signal at grazing exit angles @xcite .",
    "evidently the condition @xmath19 is satisfied in this cases .",
    "moreover , for a monolayer of atoms absorbed on the surface of crystal this condition for the escape depth of the sr is surely satisfied .    the above mentioned problem does not exist in measurements of the photoelectron emission since electrons escape from a thin subsurface layer with a thickness of fractions of a micrometer .",
    "already in the first works on the measurement of the photoelectron emission , carried out in the former soviet union in the early 70 s @xcite , the dispersion like angular dependence corresponding to the behavior of an x - ray standing wave ( [ c1.2 ] ) was observed . what was understood from the very beginning that this angular dependence of the photoelectron yield curve contain essential information about the structure of the surface layers .",
    "later this field of research was developing intensively in several scientific centers of the former soviet union ( see for details review paper @xcite and a book @xcite ) .    already in the middle sixties",
    "first attempts to measure different secondary processes were made .",
    "for example measurements of thermal diffuse and compton scattering while the existence of the standing wave in the crystal were reported @xcite ( see also later experimental paper @xcite ) .",
    "the angular dependence of the photoelectric current in the silicon crystal with @xmath20 junction while the dynamical scattering of x - rays was measured @xcite .    during last decade , due to the availability of the synchrotron radiation facilities of last generation ( esrf , aps , spring-8 )",
    "xsw method has become a useful and even in some cases a routine tool for investigating the surface of the crystals and the structure of the adsorbates .",
    "most of the results obtained up to the beginning of 90-th , especially applications of xsw technique to surface analysis were summarized in a review paper @xcite , an overview of the method was also given in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "however one of the important field of applications of the xsw method for investigation of the structure of the real crystals ( containing different type of defects , implanted crystals , epilayers on the surface of the perfect crystals , geterostructures etc . ) has not been reviewed up to now .",
    "previous review on this subject @xcite was written nearly fifteen years ago ( see also the book @xcite ) and a big number of new results are not summarized until now . at the same time still it is a big interest to the foundations of the theory of xsw in real crystals ( see for example recent paper @xcite ) . in our work we are planning to fill this gap .",
    "theoretical approach is illustrated by the experimental results obtained in the laboratory of coherent optics and synchrotron radiation of the institute of crystallography ras .",
    "due to a limited size of this manuscript we have no possibility to give a detailed consideration of all results obtained in the field of xsw method in different research centers all over the world .",
    "some of them are just mentioned or even not mentioned , but this , surely , does not mean that they are not relevant to the subject .",
    "this can be a special subject of another review paper .",
    "if xsw method in perfect crystals is based on the dynamical theory of x - ray diffraction ( see for e.g. books and reviews @xcite ) for the description of the fields and the yield of the secondary radiation from the real crystals it is most effective to use takagi - taupin theory @xcite of the propagation of x - rays in the deformed crystals . for convenience of the reader",
    "we start chapter ii with formulation of the main results of this theory that will be used in the following parts of the work . in the end of the same chapter for the same reason we give the main relationships for the description of the real and imaginary part of the susceptibilities in crystals in x - ray wavelength region . for a recent review of the dynamical theory of x - ray diffraction in a perfect and deformed crystals",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "chapter iii gives a general mathematical formalism for calculating the secondary radiation yield in a real crystal .",
    "this chapter is based on the results of the paper @xcite and represents the theoretical foundation for the remainder of this review paper .",
    "next chapter iv is devoted to the theory of xsw in the case of perfect crystals .",
    "peculiarities of the secondary radiation yield with the big and small depth of yield of the secondary radiation are discussed , in the next subsection fluorescence and photoemission yield from the crystals containing different type of atoms is analysed and in the end of the chapter crystals with amorphous surface layer are discussed .",
    "chapter v is devoted to very important and often realized case of deformed crystal , that can be approximated in the frame of bicrystal model . in the first subsection theory of the secondary radiation yield from such a model crystal in the bragg geometry",
    "is presented and in the following subsection it is illustrated by a numerous examples . in the next chapter",
    "vi laue geometry is considered , peculiarities of x - ray standing wave behavior in this geometry are discussed and illustrated by examples . in chapter",
    "vii the bicrystal model is generalized to the case of a multilayer model of the deformed layer and a secondary radiation yield from such system is analyzed theoretically and with its applications to the study of implanted crystals .",
    "secondary radiation yield from the crystals with extended deformation yield are considered in chapter viii .",
    "there is given a detailed description of the wave fields in the case of the crystals with the uniform strain gradient , which includes the case of bent crystals and as a special case vibrating crystals .",
    "next chapter ix describes one of the important applications of the xsw analysis : the possibility to solve a phase problem while x - ray scattering from deformed crystal .",
    "this approach opens the possibility to determine uniquely the structure of the surface layer directly from the scattering experiment .",
    "last section x presents a summary and an outlook for the future applications of the xsw method in real crystals .",
    "directly from the maxwell s equations for the electric field vector @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the frequency of the incident wave ) inside a crystal we can obtain the following wave propagation equation ,    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the magnitude of the wave vector ( @xmath25 is the velocity of light ) , @xmath26 is the current density induced by the electromagnetic field .",
    "this current in the case of linear electromagnetic wave theory is , in fact , a linear function of @xmath27 ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the nonlocal tensor of the conductivity of the crystal . in general case equation ( [ c2.2 ] ) describes non - local coupling between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "it takes into account all possible interactions ( such as elastic thompson scattering , photoelectric absorption , compton scattering and an inelastic scattering on thermal phonons ) between the electromagnetic wave and the crystal @xcite . the main contribution to @xmath29",
    "is connected with elastic thompson scattering and has a strictly local character ( the same is valid for the main inelastic process , that is photoelectron absorption in the dipole approximation ) so we can present the tensor of the conductivity in the following way :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the kroneker symbol and @xmath34 is the dirac @xmath35function .    for further consideration , if it is not specially noted , we will assume local coupling ( [ c2.3 ] ) . according to ( [ c2.3 ] ) , the right hand side of equation ( [ c2.1 ] ) takes the form ,    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the crystal susceptibility , related with the permittivity @xmath38 of the crystal by usual equation : @xmath39   dependence in @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    in a perfect ( ideal )",
    "crystal susceptibility @xmath42 is a periodic function with the period of the crystal lattice @xmath43 is the translation vector .",
    "it can be therefore expanded as a fourier series ,    @xmath44    where @xmath45 @xmath46 is the reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "we shall assume now , that some part of a crystal lattice ( in most of applications it is a thin surface part of the crystal ( see fig.2 ) ) is weakly deformed due to epitaxial growth , implantation or some other type of deformation or defects .",
    "it is convenient to describe this weak deformation field of a crystal lattice by two functions .",
    "the first one is the deformation vector @xmath47 , which determines the displacements of atoms in a crystal from the position of perfect lattice and the second one is the static debye - waller factor @xmath48 which takes into account the random displacements of the atoms from the equilibrium positions in the @xmath3 direction .    in the case of weak deformations ,",
    "that means that relative displacements are small on interatomic distances ,    @xmath49    the susceptibility of the crystal @xmath50 is defined from that of a perfect one according to relation @xcite ,    @xmath51    the fourier components of the susceptibility in the weakly deformed crystal ( now depending from the coordinate @xmath52 ) can be defined according to eq .",

    "( [ c2.11 ] ) will define the wave field in an ideal crystal lattice .",

    "it is so - called case of multiple wave diffraction ( see for e.g. book @xcite and review papers @xcite ) .    from the other hand it is possible to find directions for which the condition ( [ c2.14 ] ) can be fulfilled only for one reciprocal lattice vector @xmath3 , it is so - called case of the two - wave diffraction .",

    "the experimental curves both for thick and thin crystals unambiguously show that germanium is substitutional in silicon .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "31b . weak minimum and maximum",
    "were clearly observed on the increasing background .",
    "the angular dependence of the background is due to the difference between the plane wave and the wave incident on the layer due to the diffraction in the bulk .    in this series of experiments",
    "the layer with thickness @xmath519 @xmath310 is much less than the extinction length @xmath520 @xmath310 and @xmath521 .",
    "impurity atoms which are only in the layer see both standing wave fields and their interference in the angular range of the x - ray diffraction in the substrate .",
    "the interference term oscillates with increasing @xmath71 and the period of these oscillations is different at different values of the incident angle : at @xmath500 the period is equal to @xmath522 and it decreases with increasing @xmath523 . since @xmath524 , the fluorescence yield angular curve for the case of the incident plane wave strongly oscillates with the period less than the angular divergence of the real incident beam .",
    "so , in the treatment of the experimental curve the interference term can be averaged again giving a zero contribution , although the reason for this averaging is quite different for that of the previous case .    taking all this into account ,",
    "it is clear why the calculated curves in fig . 31a for substitutional and randomly distributed impurities are very similar to the curves in fig .",
    "28b , although the calculations were carried out in a double - layer model including convolution . in this case",
    "opposite to the previous one the experimental curve is in a good agreement with the model of random distribution .",
    "this means that impurity atoms are in all possible positions with respect to the standing waves formed in the substrate .",
    "nevertheless , impurities in the layer could be ordered , but with period different from the period of the substrate reflection planes .",
    "the problem of the impurity position can be solved by measuring the fluorescence yield curve in the angular range of x - ray diffraction on the epilayer .",
    "since the reflection of x - rays by the epilayer is small ( @xmath525 ) , the standing wave formed in the layer has the intensity weakly oscillating around the average value .",

    "@xmath534 is large enough .",
    "it allows to neglect the @xmath535component of the substrate standing wave and put @xmath536 in the following consideration .",

    "it is important to note here , that the standing wave picture obtained from the direct numerical calculations of the tt equations for the crystals with the usg are in a good agreement with the simplified multilayer model used in @xcite and described in the beginning of this chapter .",
    "however , from the point of the waste of the computer time the first method is much more effective .",
    "another case of x - ray standing waves in the crystals with extended deformation field : namely vibrating crystals was considered in the paper @xcite .",
    "if in the previous subsection the deformation field in crystal can be controlled by the strain gradient or radius of curvature in the case of vibrating crystal this can be achieved by changing the amplitude and the wave vector of ultrasonic excitations in the crystal .",
    "what is more important for x - ray standing wave technique - extinction length in vibrating crystals can be also tuned in controllable way .",
    "the periodic deviation of the reflection planes from their ideal position in a perfect crystal misorientates the inner crystalline structure of the crystal , effectively  switching off  the whole parts of the crystal from the dynamical diffraction scattering .",
    "increasing of the ultrasonic amplitude increases the deformation field and due to its periodic structure creates new dynamical reflexes ( satellites ) with extremely big effective extinction length . in a limit of a big ultrasonic amplitude , one can achieve the kinematical limit of diffraction when the initial reflecting power of the crystal is distributed over the large angular interval .",
    "below , following @xcite , the angular dependence of the sr yield will be considered for the special case of vibrating crystals , crystals disturbed by longitudinal ultrasonic vibrations propagating normally to the crystal surface .",
    "the advantage of this scheme is the uniform distribution of the deformation field along the crystal surface ant its layered structure in the bulk of the crystal .    in this case",
    "a vibrating crystal can be presented by a set of identical layers with thickness equal to the period of the ultrasonic wave .",
    "every layer can be approximated by a combination of thinner layers with constant value of interplaner distance ( see fig .",
    "this periodic structure give rise to an additional satellites in the reciprocal space with the position @xmath656 , where @xmath657 is the wave vector of the ultrasonic wave . with increasing the amplitude of the ultrasonic wave the undisturbed part of the crystal ( and the reflecting power of the main reflex ) decreases whereas the fraction corresponding to the satellites increases .",
    "below the special case of the so - called  high - frequency  ultrasonic wave , when the ultrasonic wavelength is smaller then the extinction length of the given reflection will be considered .",
    "this gives the possibility of investigating each satellite independently , because they do not overlap in the angular range with each other and with the main reflex .",
    "the displacement field of the ultrasonic standing wave will be taken in the following form @xmath658 where @xmath659 and @xmath22 are the amplitude and frequency of the ultrasonic vibrations ( the wave vector @xmath657 is directed along the normal to the crystal surface ) .",
    "the dynamical symmetrical x - ray diffraction on a thick crystal with the diffraction vector @xmath3 directed along the normal to the crystal surface ( axis @xmath71 ) will be considered below .",
    "the x - ray wavefield amplitudes @xmath633 and @xmath184 in the displacement field ( [ c8.4 ] ) can be effectively found from the set of tt equations ( [ c2.16 ] ) . in this case",
    "fourier component of the susceptibility of the deformed crystal @xmath660 can be presented as an infinite sum @xmath661 where @xmath662 is the bessel function of real argument . each term in the infinite sum ( [ c8.5 ] )",
    "correspond to the satellite with the diffraction vector @xmath663 . at small values of the ultrasonic amplitude @xmath659 only two first order satellites ( @xmath664 )",
    "are essential in the expansion ( [ c8.5 ] ) .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath665 and @xmath184 can be also expanded in the same way @xmath666 substituting expression ( [ c8.6 ] ) into tt equations ( [ c2.16 ] ) it is possible to obtain a set of similar equations for the amplitudes @xmath667 and @xmath668 with the following substitution @xmath669 and @xmath670 , where @xmath671 are the new values of angular deviation parameter and susceptibility of the n - th satellite .",
    "after straightforward calculations analytical solutions for the amplitudes of transmitted ( only component @xmath672 is important ) and diffracted @xmath668 wave in the vicinity of the n - th satellite can be obtained ( see for details @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray wavefield in the vicinity of the n - th satellite has the form of a standing wave with the period @xmath673@xmath674 it is important to note here that the period of the standing wave does not depend effectively on the order of the satellite , because the diffraction vector is much bigger than the wave vector of ultrasonic wave .",
    "the only parameter varying from satellite to satellite is the effective extinction length . in the angular region of the n - th satellite",
    "the effective extinction length is equal to @xmath675 where @xmath15 is the extinction length in the undisturbed crystal . according to ( [ c8.9 ] )",
    "an effective extinction length is a function of the ultrasonic amplitude @xmath659 and can be tuned by the change of the voltage applied to ultrasonic transducer .    the secondary radiation yield from the vibrating crystal",
    "can be obtained in the frame of the general theory discussed in chapter 3 . substituting the obtained values of the wave fields @xmath672 and @xmath676 into eqs .",
    "( [ c3.5 ] , [ c3.6 ] ) the angular dependence of the total secondary radiation yield @xmath677 in vibrating crystal on the n - th satellite can be presented in the form of the infinite sum @xmath678 each term in this expansion can be calculated analytically if exponential form ( [ c4.2 ] ) for the probability yield function @xmath214 is assumed .",
    "finally it was obtained @xcite that every term @xmath679 in expansion [ c8.10 ] is proportional to the relative contribution of the scattering potential @xmath680 and through this bessel function depend on the value of the amplitude of the ultrasonic wave .",
    "this theoretical approach was applied for the calculation of the photoelectron yield ( with the depth of yield @xmath681 ) from @xmath595 ( 111 ) crystal @xmath345 radiation .",
    "the ultrasonic wavelength @xmath682 was taken equal to @xmath683 . in this case",
    "general equations can be simplified and in the limit of small ultrasonic amplitude the photoelectron yield near two first satellites ( @xmath664 ) is equal to ( higher order terms in expansion ( [ c8.10 ] ) can be neglected ) @xmath684 at the same time contributions to the main reflex from two first - order satellites are completely compensated and the total sr yield can be approximated by the expression @xmath685    results of numerical calculations of the angular dependence of the photoelectron yield for the different values of ultrasonic amplitude @xmath686 are presented on fig .",
    "as it follows from the numerical calculations the photoelectron yield near the main reflex varies very slowly , however , the yield excited in the angular range of the satellites is very sensitive to the value of the ultrasound amplitude .",
    "it is important to note here that approach discussed in this subsection gives the intensity of the diffracted x - ray waves and the intensity of the sr yield for a fix time . in ordinary x - ray scattering experiment on vibrating crystals",
    "only the quantities averaged over the period of vibrations are measured .",
    "however results discussed here can be , in principle , observed in stroboscopic experiments , that are available on synchrotron radiation sources .",
    "the coincidence between the time - periodic flashes of the synchrotron radiation beam and the period of the ultrasonic vibrations gives the possibility to scatter the x - ray wave on the  frozen  distorted lattice .",
    "in the recent paper @xcite developed above theory was extended for the case of the yield of the thermal diffuse scattering in vibrating crystals .",
    "it is well known , that in any experiment based on the scattering of radiation by condensed matter , the measured quantity is an intensity , from which one can determine only the modulus of the complex valued scattering amplitude . in order to obtain comprehensive information about the structure of the scattering object , however , it is also necessary to know the phase of this amplitude .",
    "this is a general problem of scattering that arises in many applications , for example , in the study of the structure of the surface layers of single crystals by means of x - ray scattering . in this case",
    "the structure of the surface layer is directly connected via fourier transform with the angular dependence of the scattering amplitude . at the same time a standard x - ray diffraction experiment does not give an opportunity to determine the phase of this amplitude .    to solve this problem of phase determination indirect methods",
    "are widely used in x - ray crystallography ( see for review of different methods a book @xcite ) . during last years",
    "it was a rapid development of the direct methods for the phase determination of the structure factors , for example , by means of multibeam diffraction @xcite .",
    "another direct method of the structure analysis and phase determination is based on xsw method . as it was demonstrated in chapter 4 coherent fraction @xmath687 and coherent position @xmath688 represent , in fact , the @xmath689th amplitude and phase of the fourier decomposition of the distribution of atoms under consideration ( see also @xcite ) . due to availability of the synchrotron radiation sources of the third generation new methods based on the utilization of the high coherency properties of the synchrotron radiation for the phase determination",
    "has become possible @xcite . in this case",
    "powerful iterative methods for the phase retrieval are used @xcite .    here",
    "we will discuss another approach for the direct phase determination of the scattering amplitude based on the simultaneous measurements of the reflectivity and sr yield in the large angular range .",
    "this information can be used for the direct and what is very important unique determination of the profile of the structural changes of the crystal surface layer .",
    "the idea of this method was for the first time proposed in @xcite and later realized practically in @xcite .",
    "if the thickness @xmath315 of the deformed layer in the sample satisfies the condition @xmath388 , where @xmath15 is the extinction length , then the scattering of x - rays by this layer is kinematic and the scattering amplitude @xmath690 is given by @xmath691 here @xmath692 , @xmath693 , @xmath694 is the static debye - waller factor and @xmath85 . according to expression ( [ c9.1 ] ) , outside the region of the total reflection the scattering amplitude @xmath690 is the fourier transform of the complex function @xmath695 .",
    "this function and thus the structure of the surface layer can be reconstructed directly by the use of the inverse fourier transform .",
    "however , it is necessary to know both the amplitude and phase of @xmath690 .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath690 can be obtained from the angular dependence of the reflectivity curve measured in a big angular range far from the exact bragg condition according to equation @xmath696 where @xmath697 is a polarization factor equal to @xmath391 in a double - crystal experimental scheme and parameter @xmath95 is defined in ( [ c2.18 ] ) .",
    "the phase @xmath7 of the scattering amplitude @xmath690 can be determined by measuring sr yield with a small depth of yield @xmath14 satisfying the condition : @xmath698 in a big angular range far from exact bragg condition .",

    "the values of @xmath700 and @xmath701 can be found from the fitting of the central part of curves @xmath17 and @xmath705 , where conditions of the strong dynamical scattering are satisfied . finally , using inverse fourier transform ,",
    "the structure of the damaged layer can be obtained directly .    in the paper @xcite",
    "this approach was applied for the determination of the depth profile of distortions of the surface layers of silicon crystals after implantation .",
    "samples were implanted by @xmath707 ions ( with energy of 100 kev , dose of @xmath708 @xmath709 ) and then annealed ( @xmath710 , @xmath711 @xmath712 ) in an oxidized atmosphere . in experiment the ( 400 ) reflection and @xmath345 radiation were used . the photoelectron emission and the x - ray reflectivity from the samples were measured both at large deviations from the bragg angle ( fig .",
