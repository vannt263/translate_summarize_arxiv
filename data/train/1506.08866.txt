    "it follows from eq.([23 ] ) that the combination @xmath81 is independent of the index @xmath82 and hence @xmath83 for all @xmath82 and @xmath84 .",
    "thus @xmath85 gives @xmath86 similarly @xmath87 yields @xmath88 here we also assume the metric coefficient @xmath58 due to the conservation of energy - momentum tensor .",
    "thus the two nonlinear differential equations ( [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] ) now reduce to @xmath89 @xmath90 subtracting these equations , we obtain @xmath91 it has been established that dust matter - dark energy combined phases can be obtained by the exact solutions derived from a power law @xmath5 model @xcite .",
    "therefore , we follow the approach of nojiri and odintsov @xcite and use the assumption @xmath92 , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are arbitrary real constants . thus eq.([29 ] ) takes the form @xmath95      for the constraint @xmath96 eq.([30 ] ) admits the same exponential solution as given by eq.([20 ] ) .",

    "for example when @xmath106 , it follows that @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "two real roots of the quadratic equation ( [ 35 ] ) turn out to be @xmath109 thus all the physical quantities turn out to be constant in this case .",

    "the matter density and @xmath0 become @xmath115 this case also yields all the quantities constant .",

    "we get a solution for @xmath119 with the constraint equations @xmath120 @xmath121 the solution metric takes the form @xmath122 this solution matches to a spacetime which represents a non - null electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "the ricci scalar becomes @xmath123 which is non - constant .",
    "it would be worthwhile to mention here that exactly similar ricci scalar has been obtained for kasner type cylindrically symmetric solutions in @xmath19 gravity @xcite .",
    "here we also have two cases corresponding to two different roots of eq.([40 ] ) .",
