    "since the galaxies should form from gaseous system , it is important to investigate the major epoch of star formation in the gas system and to study how stars have been made during the course of galaxy evolution .",

    "since active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are associated with their host galaxies , the co luminosity of agn depends on the gaseous content of their host galaxies .",
    "therefore , any observations of molecular - line emission from high-@xmath7 objects are very useful in studying evolution of molecular gas content in galaxies.0725 , there are two more successful detections of co from high-@xmath7 objects ; 1 ) the hyperluminous infrared galaxy iras f10214 + 4725 at @xmath7 = 2.286 ( brown & vanden bout 1991 ; solomon , downes , & radford 1992 ; tsuboi & nakai 1992 ; radford et al .",

    "1994 ) . since , however , these two sources are gravitationally amplified ones ( elston , thompson , & hill 1994 ; soifer et al . 1995 ; trentham 1995 ; graham & liu 1995 ; broadhurst & lehr 1995 ; serjeant et al . 1995 ; close et al .",
    "1995 ) , we do not use these data in this study because there may be uncertainty in the amplification factor . ] in spite of the successful co detection from br 1202@xmath40725 , evans et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reported the negative co detection from 11 high-@xmath7 ( @xmath6 ) powerful radio galaxies ( prgs ) and gave the upper limits of order @xmath8 ( hereafter @xmath9 = 50 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , being comparable to or larger than that of br 1202@xmath40725 ( ohta et al . 1996 ; omont et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "here a question arises as why co emission was detected from the high-@xmath7 quasar at @xmath12 while not detected from the high-@xmath7 ( @xmath6 ) prgs .",
    "there may be two alternative answers : 1 ) the host galaxies are different between quasars and prgs in terms of molecular gas contents . or , 2 ) although the host galaxies are basically similar between quasars and prgs , their evolutionary stages are different and thus the molecular gas contents are systematically different between the two classes . provided that the current unified model for quasars and radio galaxies ( barthel 1989 ) is also applicable to high-@xmath7 populations , it is unlikely that their host galaxies are significantly different . since it is usually considered that luminous agns like quasars and prgs are associated with either massive ellipticals or bulges of disk galaxies as well as merger nuclei , the evolution of ism would be rapidly proceeded during the era of spheroidal component formation",
    "therefore , we investigate the latter possibility ( i.e. , evolutionary effect ) and discuss some implications on the evolution of ism in galaxies .",
    "assuming that the luminous agns are harbored in giant elliptical galaxies and/or in bulges of spiral galaxies , we investigate the evolution of co luminosity based on a galactic wind model for elliptical galaxies proposed by arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) and a bulge - disk model for spiral galaxies by arimoto & jablonka ( 1991 ) .",
    "the so - called _ infall _ model of galaxy chemical evolution is adopted for both spheroidals and disks and time variations of gas mass and gas metallicity , in particular @xmath13 , are calculated numerically by integrating usual differential equations for chemical evolution without introducing the instantaneous recycling approximation for stellar lifetime .",
    "model parameters , such as star formation rate ( sfr ) @xmath14 , a slope of initial mass function ( imf ) @xmath15 , and gas accretion rate ( acr ) @xmath16 , are taken from arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) and arimoto & jablonka ( 1991 ) .",
    "the lower and upper stellar mass limits are set to be @xmath17 m@xmath18 and @xmath19 m@xmath18 , respectively .    according to jablonka , martin , & arimoto ( 1996 ) , who found that the @xmath20 relation of bulges are exactly identical to that of elliptical galaxies , we consider that bulges are small ellipticals of equivalent luminosity and that both spheroidal systems share the similar history of star formation . thus , for ellipticals and bulges , we assume that the remaining gas is expelled completely after the onset of galactic wind , which takes place once the thermal energy released from supernovae exceeds the binding energy of the gas . the wind times , @xmath21 gyr for giant ellipticals ( m@xmath22 m@xmath18 ) and @xmath23 gyr for bulges ( m@xmath24 m@xmath18 ) , are taken from arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) .    for spiral galaxies , assuming that the bulge and disk evolve independently",
    ", we construct a model by combining the bulge and disk models with m@xmath24 m@xmath18 and @xmath25 m@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "this model gives @xmath26 mag for the bulge and @xmath27 mag for the disk at the age of 15 gyr old ( arimoto & jablonka 1991 ) .",
    "the bulge - to - disk light ratio in v - band is @xmath28 , nearly twice of typical values for early type spirals ( simien & de vaucouleurs 1986 ) .",
    "the @xmath29 refers to that of co(@xmath30=1 - 0 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath29 of high-@xmath7 galaxies are measured by using much higher transitions such as @xmath30=3 - 2 , 4 - 3 , and so on .",
    "however , it is known that that local co - rich galactic nuclei and starburst nuclei have @xmath29(@xmath30=3 - 2)@xmath31(@xmath30=1 - 0 ) @xmath32 ( devereux et al .",
    "1994 ; israel & van der werf 1996 ) .",

    "the mass of dust and the number of uv photons should also evolve as a result of galactic chemical evolution ( honma , sofue , & arimoto 1995 ) .",

    "the dashed line shows a case for a wind model , but the gas ejected from evolving giants after the wind is bound and accumulated in the galaxy to form neutral gas ( bound - wind model ; arimoto 1989 ) .",
    "the co luminosity , @xmath52 , of elliptical galaxies increases prominently soon after their birth , and attains the maximum at an epoch of about 0.85 gyr since the birth , or at @xmath53 .",
    "then , it suddenly decreases when the galactic wind has expelled the ism from the galaxy .    the extremely luminous phase in co observed for the high @xmath7 quasar br 1202@xmath40725 ( ohta et al .",
    "1996 ; omont et al .",
    "1996 ) can be well explained , if it is in the star forming phase of the whole elliptical system .",
    "moreover , the non - detection of the smaller redshift galaxies as observed by evans et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and van ojik et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is also naturally understood by the present model : it is because of the fact that elliptical galaxies at @xmath54 contains little ism .    in the figure ,",
    "we also superpose co observational data for lower redshift elliptical galaxies ( wiklind & rydbeck 1986 ; sage & wrobel 1989 ; wiklind & henkel 1989 ; eckart et al . 1991 ; lees et al . 1991 ; sage & galletta 1993 ; sofue & wakamatsu 1993 ; wiklind , combes , & henkel 1995 ) . the theoretical curve for the bound - wind model is clearly inconsistent with the observations for galaxies at @xmath55 .",
    "this suggests that the gas has been expelled continuously after the galactic wind ( @xmath7 @xmath56 4 ) and has not been bound to the system .",
    "this , in turn , is consistent with the idea that the intracluster hot gas with high metallicity , as observed in x - rays , may have been supplied by the winds from early type galaxies ( ishimaru & arimoto 1997 ) . although it is not clarified how the gas has been expelled out of the galaxies , without being bound to the system , recent studies suggest that it is probably due to the energy supply from either the type ia supernovae ( renzini et al .",
    "1994 ) or the intermittent agn activities ( ciotti & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the result for a spiral galaxy , where the initial masses of bulge and disk are taken to be @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the co luminosity of the bulge evolves in almost the same fashion as an elliptical galaxy as above : @xmath52 increases rapidly after the birth , attains the maximum within 0.36 gyr , and , then , suddenly decreases because of the strong wind from the star - forming bulge .",
    "the co luminosity of the thus - calculated forming bulge seems insufficient to be detected as the observed luminosity of br 1202@xmath40725 , unless the bulge is much heavier than @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , we emphasize that the duration of this bright phase in @xmath52 is shorter than that obtained for ellipticals by a factor of two , and therefore , the probability to detect such co - bright phase for a bulge would be much smaller than that for elliptical galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , formation of the gaseous disk due to gas infall and star formation then proceeds mildly , and , therefore , the metal pollution of ism in the disk is slower , which results in a slower increase of the co luminosity . as a consequence ,",
    "the co luminosity increases gradually and monotonically until today . also , the less - luminous phase due to the disk , following the wind phase of the bulge , is in agreement with the upper - limit observations of evans et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and van ojik et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "we also plot co observations for more other nearby spiral galaxies , as plotted by filled circles ( braine et al .",
    "the evolution of the co luminosity of these galaxies can be traced back by adjusting the present - day luminosity of the calculated track .",
    "the most luminous nearby spirals in co is ngc 4565 ( @xmath59 k km s@xmath10 pc@xmath40 ) .",
    "it is interesting to mention that , if the model is normalized to this galaxy , the peak co luminosity corresponding to the forming bulge phase can be still sufficient to explain the luminosity of br 1202@xmath40725 .",
    "the present study has shown that the current radio telescope facilities are capable of detecting co emission from high - redshift galaxies which experience their initial starbursts if the following two conditions are satisfied ; 1 ) the masses of systems should exceed @xmath60 , and 2 ) their evolutionary phases should be prior to the galactic wind .",
    "therefore , the detectability of co emission from high-@xmath7 galaxies is severely limited by the above two conditions .",
    "our study suggests that co emission can be hardly detected from galaxies with redshift @xmath3 without an amplification either by galaxy mergers and/or by gravitational lensing .",
    "this prescription is consistent with the observations ; co emission was detected from the high - redshift quasar br 1202@xmath40725 at @xmath5 ( ohta et al .",
    "1996 ; omont et al .",
    "1996 ) while not detected from the radio galaxies with @xmath6 ( evans et al .",
    "1996 and van ojik et al .",
    "1997 ) and quasars with redshift @xmath0 2 ( takahara et al .",
    "further , the two convincing detections of co emission from the high-@xmath7 objects at @xmath61 , iras f10214 + 4724 ( cf .",
    "radford et al . 1996 ) and the cloverleaf quasar h1413 + 135 ( barvanis et al . 1994 ) , are actually gravitationally amplified sources .",
    "the striking non - detection of high-@xmath7 galaxies in co at @xmath6 implies that most elliptical galaxies and bulges of spiral galaxies were formed before @xmath62 , or high-@xmath7 galaxies with @xmath6 observed in the optical and infrared studies may be galaxies after the epoch of galactic wind .",
    "this implication is consistent with the formation epoch ( @xmath63 ) of high-@xmath7 quasars studied by chemical properties of the broad emission - line regions ( hamann & ferland 1992 , 1993 ; hill , thompson , & elston 1993 ; elston et al .",
    "1994 ; kawara et al . 1996",
    "; taniguchi et al .",
    "therefore it is strongly suggested that most host galaxies of high-@xmath7 agn were formed before @xmath62 .    according to our model",
    ", it would be worth noting that quasar nuclei are hidden by the dusty clouds unless the galactic wind could expel them from the host galaxies .",
    "we also mention that any quasar nuclei are not necessarily to associate with gas - rich circumnuclear environment though this implication is in contradiction to what suggested for low-@xmath7 agn ( yamada 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , it seems very lucky that the co emission was detected from br 1202@xmath40725 at @xmath12 .",
    "finally , we revisit the important question : what is br 1202@xmath40725 ? as shown in section 3 , the unambiguous co detection from br 1202@xmath40725 is interpreted as an initial starburst galaxy which is forming either an elliptical or a bulge with mass larger than @xmath64 . the elongated ( ohta et al .",
    "1996 ) or the double - peaked ( omont et al .",
    "1996 ) co distribution may be understood as possible evidence for galactic wind in terms of our scenario .",
    "if it is an elliptical galaxy , its formation epoch is estimated to be @xmath65 . however ,",
    "if it were a bulge former , the mass of bulge should be comparable with that of typical ellipticals .",
    "since such massive bulges are rarer by two orders of magnitude than elliptical with similar masses ( e.g. , woltier 1990 ) , the host of br 1202@xmath40725 may be an elliptical from a statistical ground .",
