    "since the discovery of x - ray synchrotron radiation from sn1006 @xcite it has been found that most young , shell - type supernova remnants ( snrs ) emit x - ray synchrotron radiation ( * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "for the youngest snrs cas  a , kepler ( sn1604 ) and tycho ( sn1572 ) this radiation is confined to a narrow region close to the shock front .",
    "this does not seem to be the case for somewhat older , but physically much larger objects like rcw 86 , g266.2 - 1.2 @xcite and g347.3 - 0.5 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission from the latter two snrs does in fact only reveal synchrotron radiation , and both have been detected in tev gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the thickness of the x - ray synchrotron emitting region is directly related to the post - shock magnetic field strength ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "the relatively strong fields found are probably a result of magnetic field amplification by cosmic ray streaming ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of x - ray synchrotron radiation is in itself an indication of efficient acceleration , and if the cut - off energy of the photon spectrum is determined by synchrotron losses , it is independent of the magnetic field strength , but scales with shock velocity , as @xmath3 @xcite .    here",
    "we report on the analysis of _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  data of the northeastern ( ne ) part of rcw 86  ( g315.4 - 2.1 ) . rcw 86  is an interesting snr .",
    "the non - thermal x - ray emitting regions are broader than those of the historical snrs , and not confined to the forward shock region , possibly as a result of projection effects @xcite . in that respect rcw 86  resembles g266.2 - 1.2 and g347.3 - 0.5 .",
    "however , unlike those snrs rcw 86  also emits noticeable thermal x - ray emission .",
    "this allows the determination of plasma properties , which can help to determine the conditions that may potentially lead to x - ray synchrotron emission in older snrs .",
    "in particular the ne part seems best suited for that purpose , since the x - ray synchrotron radiation is confined to the region directly behind the shock front , and , as a result , the geometry of the emitting region is easier to asses .",

    "the ne of rcw 86  was observed by _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  for their joint program .",
    "the _ chandra _  observation ( i d 500436 ) has a net exposure time of 72.6 ks and was made on june 6 , 2004 . the _ xmm - newton _  observation ( i d 0208000101 )",

    "for comparison we also present an analysis of epic - mos data of an observation of the northern part of rcw 86  ( obs i d 0110011401 , 18 ks ) . moreover , we used all six observations of rcw 86  by _ xmm - newton _  to produce the x - ray map shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_maps ] .",
    "it also shows the spectral extraction regions .",
    "background spectra were taken from regions outside the snr .",
    "the data reduction was done with the standard software packages ciao 3.0 for _ chandra _  and sas 6.5.0 for _ xmm - newton_.    the spectrum from the region labeled `` ne '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig_spectra ] ) shows an absence of bright line features .",
    "this is usually taken as a sign for synchrotron emission @xcite , but for rcw 86it has been argued by some of us in the past that non - thermal bremsstrahlung may be viable mechanism as well @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons was the detection of fe - k emission at 6.4  kev in the southwest coinciding with the hard x - ray continuum .",
    "this interpretation was disputed by @xcite , based on energetic grounds . here",
    "we concur with that view .",
    "in fact the _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  spectra of the ne region do not show any evidence for fe - k emission , providing additional evidence for an x - ray synchrotron interpretation .",
    "figure  [ fig_plate ] shows that along the shell the x - ray emission changes from thermal radiation to predominantly synchrotron radiation . unlike in other parts of rcw 86",
    ", it is unambiguous that in the ne the non - thermal emission starts at the shock front .",
    "surprisingly , the radio map shows that in the ne the x - ray synchrotron radiation is not associated with bright radio emission , but instead relatively weak radio emission . in order to better determine the plasma conditions of the x - ray synchrotron emitting regions , we do not present here the spectrum extracted from the whole x - ray synchrotron emitting region , but from a smaller region , labeled `` ne '' in fig .",
    "[ fig_maps ] , which shows more traces of thermal emission .",
    "apart from the ne shell , we also analyzed a faint region outside the main shell ( `` n - faint '' ) , which shows up better in radio than in x - ray .",
    "we fitted the epic - mos spectra using the spectral analysis software spex @xcite .",
    "the spectra are reasonably well described by a combination of two non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) models or , for the x - ray synchrotron dominated regions , by one nei model and a power law spectrum ( table  [ tab_spectra ] ) .",
    "the spectral fits indicate extreme departures from collisional equilibration , even compared to other young snrs , except for sn1006 @xcite . although the fit quality is not always satisfactory , both the fitted models and the raw spectra itself ( fig .",
    "[ fig_spectra ] ) show that the fainter the thermal emission , the lower the ionization degree .",
    "this can be judged from the increase of oviii with respect to the ovii emission and presence of fe l emission from the brighter parts .",
    "there is also a hint that the x - ray synchrotron emitting regions contain hotter plasma , and are characterized by lower ionization parameters ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "however , we caution that , since most of the continuum is non - thermal , the temperature is solely determined by line ratios , making it more sensitive to potential errors in the atomic data .",
    "this may also explain the peculiarity that whenever a second thermal component was fitted , its best @xmath53  value was much higher than the principal component .",
    "the second component improved , in particular , the fit between 1 and 1.2 kev , dominated by @xmath54  ne ix line emission .",
    "a recent development in the interpretation of x - ray synchrotron radiation is that the width of the region can be used to estimate the downstream magnetic field .",
    "however , different groups have used , at face value , different methods for estimating the magnetic field : @xcite assumed that the width , @xmath55 , of the x - ray synchrotron emitting region is determined by a combination of plasma velocity relatively to the shock front , @xmath56 , and the synchrotron loss time @xmath57  , i.e. @xmath58 , with @xmath59 the particle energy in erg and @xmath60  the magnetic field strength in gauss .",
    "the other method assumes that the width corresponds to the diffusion length scale @xcite , given by @xmath61 , with @xmath62 the diffusion coefficient .",
    "in essence @xmath63  is the length scale at which advection starts to dominate over diffusion as means of transporting particles .",
    "both methods give a combination of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which can be solved by using the fact that the observed photon energies peak around @xmath64.both methods rely on different assumptions .",
    "first of all , for standard shocks @xmath65 , but for very efficient shock acceleration the compression factor may be stronger than a factor 4 . secondly , the diffusion length method assumes @xmath62 , which is the smallest diffusion coefficient possible , as the particle mean free path is then equal to the gyro - radius ( the `` bohm limit '' ) .",
    "it turns out that with both methods very similar magnetic field estimates are obtained @xcite . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "this is to be expected if one observes the x - ray synchrotron spectrum near the spectral cut - off energies : the acceleration time for particles according to the first order fermi acceleration theory is , within a factor of order one , @xmath66  @xcite . for electrons",
    "the acceleration is limited by synchrotron losses .",
    "so there is only a net acceleration if @xmath67 , and the maximum energy is reached when @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "so : @xmath69 therefore , @xmath70  is the geometrical equivalent of @xmath71 .",
    "note that the _ observational _ fact that the diffusion length scale and advection length scale methods give similar results is a justification for the assumption that the diffusion coefficient is close to the bohm limit , and a compression ratio close to the standard value of 4 @xcite .",
    "the _ chandra _  image reveals a width of the x - ray synchrotron shell of @xmath72 , corresponding to @xmath73  cm for a distance of @xmath74  kpc @xcite . fitting a projected shell model we estimate a physical width of @xmath75  cm .",
    "in addition we apply a factor 0.6 , because the actual width is a convolution of advection and diffusion processes ( i.e. we set @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) of @xcite ) , so @xmath77  cm . assuming that the shock velocity is @xmath78  kms@xmath1  @xcite gives inconsistent results for the two methods : @xmath79  @xmath80 g   employing the diffusion length method , and 6  @xmath80 g  assuming the advection length method .",
    "however , if we no longer assume a shock velocity of 600  kms@xmath1 , which after all was based on optical observations of a different part of rcw 86  from which no x - ray synchrotron radiation is emitted , we can use the condition that @xmath81 in order to estimate @xmath82 and @xmath60 , using an observed photon energy of @xmath83  kev .",
    "we found that @xmath60 can be directly estimated from the diffusion / advection length alone , whereas the plasma velocity only depends on the photon energy : @xmath84 where @xmath85 the shock compression factor .",
    "( [ eq_aharonian ] ) was previously reported by @xcite . to get more accurate estimations one has to solve the",
    ", model dependent , kinetic equations for the particle distribution . for the moment",
    ", we estimate the error in the physical width due to distance uncertainties and projection effects to be @xmath86% , resulting in an error in @xmath60 of @xmath87  @xmath80 g .",
    "the downstream magnetic field therefore appears to be lower than for other snrs @xcite .",
    "there is some uncertainty in the actual cut - off energy of the synchrotron spectrum ( see below ) , but uncertainties about the assumptions - larger compression ratio , less efficient diffusion - make eq .",
    "( [ eq_aharonian ] ) effectively a lower limit .",
    "one may wonder why the shock velocity in some regions may be so much higher , and why it has not resulted in a more distorted shell . here",
    "the thermal spectra helps to answer this question . for all fitted regions the @xmath53  value of the primary component is low , being @xmath53@xmath88  @xmath6s  even for the brightest region",
    ". from the size of our extraction box , we estimate that the emitting volume is @xmath89  @xmath90 , together with the emission measure this implies an electron density of @xmath91  @xmath6 .",
    "if we use this to estimate how long ago the plasma was shock heated we find @xmath92  yr .",
    "this is surprisingly short for a large snr as rcw 86 .",
    "in such a time the difference in radius between regions with low and high shock velocity would be @xmath93  pc on an average shock radius of 16  pc .",
    "the short interaction time supports the idea that rcw 86  is a snr expanding in a wind blown bubble @xcite .",
    "such snrs expand rapidly for a long time , but the shock velocity drops rather suddenly as soon as the shock starts interacting with the surrounding shell swept up by the stellar wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that in rcw 86  the shock has reached in some regions the dense shell around the bubble some 400  yr ago , after which it rapidly decelerated . in other regions",
    "the shock velocity is still high , but , due to the low density , the thermal x - ray emission is weak .",
    "this explains the coexistence of relatively weak radio synchrotron emission with conspicuous x - ray synchrotron emission : due to the lower density fewer electrons are accelerated , but because of the high shock velocity they can be accelerated to higher energies .",
    "interestingly , the x - ray synchrotron radiation is relatively bright , with respect to the radio emission , because we find that the simplest broad band synchrotron model , i.e. synchrotron radiation from a power law electron spectrum with an exponential cut - off does not fit the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig_broadband ] ) .",
    "it can explain the x - ray flux , but not the spectral slope .",
    "instead the electron spectrum needs to be concave , as predicted by non - linear shock acceleration models .",
    "however , we can not determine whether the electron power law index bends toward -2 , predicted for an overall shock compression ratio of 4 , or toward -1.5 , predicted for strongly cosmic ray modified shocks @xcite",
    ".    the ne region of rcw 86  has properties resembling those of the tev emitting snrs g347.3 - 0.5 , and g266.2 - 1.2 : weak radio emission , and x - ray emission ( almost ) entirely consisting of synchrotron radiation .",
    "for rcw 86  the ( weak ) thermal x - ray emission indicates that these properties are due to a low density combined with a , relatively , high shock velocity .",
    "we speculate that for g347.3 - 0.5 and g266.2 - 1.2 the shock also moves through a low density region , e.g. a stellar wind bubble , and the shock velocity is similarly high .",
    "rcw 86  may be different in that some parts of the shock have reached the shell . inside the bubble",
    "the shock evolution can be approximated by the sedov self - similar model , but this breaks down as soon as the shell is reached . finally , assuming a sedov evolution and using the apparent radius of 22 , the age of the remnant is estimated to be @xmath94  yr .",
    "this would put the explosion date of rcw 86  closer to ad 185 , the year a putative supernova was observed in china @xcite .",
    "a shock velocity of @xmath95  kms@xmath1   would be more consistent with a 10,000  yr old snr .",
    "our results , therefore , strengthen the case that the event recorded by chinese astronomers was indeed a supernova and that rcw 86  is its remnant ."
