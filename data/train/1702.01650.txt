    "however , other ingredients , such as hyperfine interaction and spin - orbit coupling , do not conserve total spin and can thus couple the singlet to the states with @xmath282 .",
    "roughly speaking , a requirement for successful initialization of the qubit is thus that all level crossings observed in figs .",
    "[ fig : s1](b  d ) are swept through fast enough so that the chance for a hyperfine- or spin - orbit - mediated transition to a different spin state is strongly suppressed .",
    "we estimate the probability for the desired `` diabatic '' transition using the landau - zener parameter , @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the matrix element that couples the two states and @xmath124 is the sweep speed , i.e.  the rate of change of the energy of the level ( in units of energy per second ) .",

    "taking @xmath286ev , which would be the order of magnitude of a matrix element present due to a set of local random effective magnetic fields of magnitude @xmath287  mt , we find as condition @xmath288ev / ns . note that a similar constraint holds for the initialization procedure of the triple - dot exchange - only qubit : along the path of the initialization pulse , the level crossing with the @xmath289 quadruplet state has to be swept through fast enough to avoid transitions into that state  @xcite .",
    "note also that the path we chose for the initialization pulse avoids the charge states ( 1,0,1,2 ) and ( 2,0,1,1 ) . in these charge states",
    "the singly occupied dots are not neighboring each other directly , leading to a reduced singlet - triplet splitting due to interdot exchange effects .",
    "all levels with @xmath138 thus lie much closer to each other , making it harder to sweep through level crossings fast enough and avoid leakage into the triplet states .",
    "a similar problem arises for paths that enter ( or come too close to ) the charge state ( 1,2,0,1 ) .",
    "current technology allows for the fabrication of relatively complex structures involving four and more quantum dots in gated semiconductor substrates  @xcite .",

    "<S> we propose a new , quantum - dot - based singlet - only spin qubit which is to leading order intrinsically insensitive to random effective magnetic fields set up by fluctuating nuclear spins in the host semiconductor . </S>",

    "<S> this makes our qubit one of unprecedented quality .    </S>",
    "<S> spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots are one of the more promising scalable qubit implementations put forward so far  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the original proposal almost two decades ago  @xcite was rapidly followed by early experimental successes , including demonstration of the principles of qubit initialization , manipulation , and read - out  @xcite . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , two main challenges for further progress were identified : ( i ) single - qubit manipulation requires highly localized oscillating magnetic fields , which are very hard to realize in practice . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) all high - quality iii - v semiconductors ( such as gaas ) consist of atoms carrying non - zero nuclear spin , and the fluctuating ensemble of nuclear spins in each quantum dot couples to the spin of localized electrons through hyperfine interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling causes spin relaxation  @xcite and yields random effective local magnetic fields acting on the electron spins , which present an important source of qubit decoherence  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of the work in the field of semiconductor spin qubits in the past decade has been aimed at overcoming these two challenges .    </S>",
    "<S> one proposed solution to the problem of the oscillating magnetic fields is to use a material with relatively strong spin - orbit interaction ( such as inas ) , in which coherent spin rotations could be achieved by the application of oscillating _ electric _ fields  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a drawback is that spin - orbit interaction contributes to qubit relaxation  @xcite and also interferes with the spin - to - charge conversion commonly used for qubit initialization and read - out  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another approach is to encode the qubit in a _ </S>",
    "<S> multi_-electron spin state , which enables qubit control through ( gate - tunable ) exchange interactions  @xcite : using two - electron spin states in a double quantum dot , one can define a qubit in the unpolarized singlet - triplet ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) subspace , which allows for electrical control of qubit rotations along one axis of the bloch sphere  @xcite ; and recently it was realized that with one more quantum dot ( and electron ) one can use two three - electron spin states to define a qubit that has _ two _ of such control axes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting triple - dot exchange - only ( xo ) qubit can thus be fully operated by electrical means only  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these successes eliminated the need for highly localized oscillating magnetic fields , leaving the problem of the nuclear spins as the main obstacle for further progress  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> common approaches to overcome this problem include devising hyperfine - induced feedback cycles , where driving the electronic spins out of equilibrium results in a suppression of the fluctuations of the nuclear spin ensemble  @xcite , as well as optimizing complex echo pulsing schemes , where the dominating frequencies in the spectrum of the nuclear spin fluctuations are effectively filtered out  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although some of these approaches led to significantly prolonged coherence times , they all involve a large cost in overhead for qubit operation .    here </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new type of spin qubit that can be hosted in gaas - based quantum dots , but ( i ) is intrinsically insensitive to the nuclear fields in the dots and ( ii ) can be operated fully electrically , similar to the triple - dot xo qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to use _ </S>",
    "<S> four_-electron spin states to encode the qubit in : four spin-@xmath3 particles can be in 16 different spin states , among which two are singlets with total spin @xmath4  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since spin - zero states are not coupled by any effective or external magnetic field , a qubit defined in this singlet - only subspace does not decohere ( to leading order ) in the presence of a fluctuating nuclear spin bath . </S>",
    "<S> below we propose a feasible quantum - dot - based implementation of such a qubit , investigate its properties for realistic parameters , and show how it can be initialized , manipulated , and read out . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , at the price of a slight increase in complexity beyond the triple - dot xo setup , our qubit has superior coherence properties , extending @xmath0 by orders of magnitude , while still having a highly scalable design .     and @xmath5 , using @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",

    "<S> read - out of the qubit can be performed by spin - to - charge conversion , in a similar way as in the double - dot @xmath1-@xmath2 @xcite and triple - dot xo  @xcite qubits . </S>",
    "<S> the detuning @xmath34 is quickly pulsed to the point marked @xmath76 in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> there are only two accessible ( 1,0,1,2)-states with @xmath9 : the two electrons on dot 4 must be in a singlet state , but the electrons on dot 1 and 3 can form either a singlet @xmath1 or unpolarized triplet @xmath2 . only the singlet - singlet configuration couples adiabatically to one of the qubit states ( the state @xmath47 ) . after pulsing to @xmath76 , the qubit state @xmath47 will thus transition to a ( 1,0,1,2 ) charge configuration whereas the state @xmath48 remains in a spin - blockaded ( 1,1,1,1 ) state . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent charge sensing amounts to a projective measurement of the qubit state . </S>",
    "<S> one requirement is that the detuning pulse has to be fast enough so that spin - flip transitions from @xmath47 to one of the lower - lying states with @xmath77 , which are crossed at @xmath78 , are very unlikely . </S>",

    "<S> initialization of the qubit can be achieved in a similar way . </S>",

    "<S> for this pulse the same condition holds as for the read - out pulse : it should be fast enough to not allow for spin - flip transitions into the lower - lying states with @xmath82  @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> decoherence._the main source of decoherence in gaas - based spin qubits is known to be the fluctuating bath of nuclear spins that couples to the qubit states through hyperfine interaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the ensemble of @xmath83 nuclear spins in each quantum dot can to good approximation be modeled as a randomly and slowly fluctuating effective magnetic field @xmath84 acting on the electrons localized in the dot @xmath15 . </S>",

    "<S> value of these random fields was reported to be @xmath853  mt in typical gaas quantum dots  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting uncertainty in the qubit level splitting translates to a decoherence time @xmath0 of tens of ns , and forms at present the bottleneck for further improvement of the performance of gaas - based spin qubits .    to understand the effect of hyperfine interaction on the singlet - only qubit , we write the effective hamiltonian @xmath86 and project this hamiltonian to the qubit subspace </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath87 this confirms that , to leading order , the nuclear fields do not affect the qubit and thus do not cause any decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> the hyperfine hamiltonian does , however , couple both qubit states to all nine four - electron triplet states . </S>",
    "<S> coupling to the triplet states with @xmath88 is mediated by @xmath89 and @xmath90 , but transitions to these states are strongly suppressed by the large zeeman energy @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath21-components of the nuclear fields couple @xmath47 and @xmath48 to @xmath45 , and this coupling ( i ) can cause leakage out of the qubit space , analogous to leakage to the spin-@xmath3 quadruplet state in the triple - dot xo qubit , and ( ii ) can yield a higher - order shift in the qubit splitting , contributing to qubit decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> both effects are suppressed by the small factor @xmath91 ( where @xmath92 is the typical energy scale of the exchange energies @xmath93 ) , and the decoherence time resulting from the fluctuations of the qubit splitting can be estimated as @xmath94  @xcite . for typical parameters ( @xmath95ev and </S>",

    "<S> we observe eight rabi oscillations in @xmath107  ns without any significant decay @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of course , at longer times eventually leakage out of the qubit space as well as higher - order corrections due to the nuclear fields will suppress the oscillations in @xmath108 .    as a comparison </S>",
