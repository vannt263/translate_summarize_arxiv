    "the top quark is , because of its high mass , one of the least well known particles of the standard model . among the properties that still have to be measured",
    "lie the electric charge and the @xmath0 ckm matrix element . to measure the first",
    ", the production of the top quark should happen trough photon interaction in order to probe the photon - top coupling .",
    "the second requires a weak interaction trough the w boson which results in the production of a single top quark .",
    "photoproduction at the lhc offers good conditions for both studies .",
    "first , the top quark photoproduction cross - section is important ( around 2.5 pb ) .",
    "moreover , more than 50@xmath4 of this cross - section implies only one top quark in the final state , against only 5@xmath4 in the case of partonic interactions .",
    "second , an important part of this top production happens trough a photon - quark coupling , implying an important dependance of the cross - section in the top charge .",
    "probing the possible anomalous photoproduction of single top via flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) is also favoured at the lhc because of the high expected cross - section compared to the one expected at hera . for same values of the anomalous coupling @xmath2",
    ", the cross - section is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher .",
    "furthermore , while at hera only the up quark content of the proton contributed , the energy of the lhc allows to probe the proton at lower momentum fraction , opening the opportunity to probe the effect of the c quark via the @xmath3 coupling .",
    "in the standard model ( sm ) , single top photoproduction occurs at tree - level trough two main processes for which the diagrams can be seen at fig .",
    "[ sm_stop_diags ] . as two w bosons appear in the final state after the decay of the top quark , three type of topologies are possible , either fully leptonic , semileptonic or hadronic .",
    "only the fully leptonic and semileptonic ones have been investigated , for which the cross - sections are 104 fb and 440 fb respectively .",
    "all processes simulations have been done in the way described in @xcite .",
    "this includes tree - level computation of processes , hadronisation and a fast detector simulation based on particle 4-vector smearing and a cone algorithm for jets reconstruction .",
    "most of the backgrounds appear in two kind of processes .",
    "the first , called _",
    "irreducible _ comes from photoproduction with very similar final state as the signal .",
    "the second has the same final state but occurs through different processes induced by partonic interactions and is called _",
    "reducible background_.    main backgrounds for the leptonic topology come from processes including two w bosons and either a b - jet or a light jet that could be mistagged as a b - jet .",
    "these include @xmath5 for which one jet is not reconstructed .",
    "the semileptonic topology has more contributing backgrounds due to the various possible jet production processes .",
    "these mainly include semileptonic and leptonic @xmath5 production and w boson production associated with three jets or more .",
    "this is summarized in tables [ lep_bkg ] and [ sem_bkg ] .",
    "one should note that inelastic photoproduction , namely the case for which the proton having emitted a photon does not survive the interaction , has not been taken into account .",
    "this would add to the cross - section of both signal and irreducible backgrounds .",
    "the cross - sections for such inelastic processes is not precisely known , as because of the small impact parameter the probability of rescattering becomes important .",
    "this makes the efficiency of tagging such events much harder to compute precisely , leading to important systematic errors .",
    "diffractive background processes have also not been considered here , although they can look very similar to photoproduction in some cases .",
    ".background processes used in the leptonic channel .",
    "cross - sections include the branching ratio of the w boson to any lepton and generation cuts of @xmath6 for leptons and @xmath7 for jets . [ cols=\"<,<,>,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ sys_ano ]      using the lrg requirement for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb@xmath1 ,",
    "one gets the following final result ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) :    @xmath10    while for 30 fb@xmath1 at higher luminosity using the vfds to tag photoproduction the final sample is composed of :    @xmath11    in order to set a limit on the anomalous couplings , we assumed a measurement in agreement with the sm , i.e seeing the background only .",
    "given this measurement , we computed the maximum cross - section for which this measurement was not less than 5@xmath4 probable .",
    "this cross - section corresponds to the minimum real cross - section for which the `` sm only '' hypothesis will be rejected at 95 @xmath4 c.l . and thus gives the minimum anomalous cross - section once the sm cross - section is substracted .",
    "the number of events was assumed to be distributed according to a poisson distribution , while the systematic uncertainty was included using monte carlo to obtain a realistic convolution of statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the obtained expected limits on the anomalous couplings are the following :    @xmath12",
    "both above study show the potential to bring precise measurement of important parameters linked to top quark physics",
    ". the @xmath0 measurement with a precision of 10 @xmath4 to 17 @xmath4 should be competitive to the partonic processes - based one , allowing to improve it .",
    "the anomalous couplings limits should be at least 3 - 4 times better than the ones obtanied at hera .    however , both studies will be refined when full detector simulation will be used , providing a better estimate of the systematic errors in order to replace the pessimistic ones used in the present analysis .",
    "also , studying the influence of diffractive backgrounds is an important part of the work to be done , as well as the contribution of inelastic photon emissions to both signal and backgrounds .",
