    "analysis of restricted ranges of data as presently done by some authors for vibrational frequencies@xcite is one way to improve the normality of residuals , but as demonstrated above , prediction from small calibration sets calls for more information than the rms .      1 .   for large calibration sets of accurate data , as the ones used for calibration of uniform scaling factors for vibrational frequencies , reliable prediction uncertainty can be simply based on the rms @xmath8 ( eq .
