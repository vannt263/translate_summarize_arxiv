    "phase behavior of non - spherical hard bodies with their centers of mass confined in planar geometry is receiving considerable attention due to the recent development of the preparation of colloidal particles with various shapes and new experimental techniques .",
    "nowadays it is possible to prepare colloids with several geometrical shapes such as cubes , polyhedrons , octopods , ellipsoids and helices [ 1 - 6 ] .",
    "the anisotropic colloids can be confined at the interfaces [ 7 - 11 ] , between two parallel solid walls [ 12,13 ] , at the bottom of the sample holder [ 14 ] , at a substrate surface [ 15 ] and into a lamellar matrix of surfactants [ 16,17 ] .",
    "the confinement can be so strong that even colloidal monolayers can be realized experimentally .",
    "ordering properties of two - dimensional and quasi two - dimensional ( q2d ) non- spherical colloids has been the subject of several experimental and theoretical studies [ 17 - 36 ] .",
    "the reason for this is that the nature of two - dimensional ( 2d ) nematic ordering is quite different from the three - dimensional ( 3d ) one .",
    "it shows only quasi - long - range orientational order with algebraically decaying orientational correlations and the ordering transitions between isotropic and nematic phases are first order or continuous through a kosterlitz - thouless disclination unbinding type mechanism [ 18 , 37 ] .",
    "strictly 2d colloidal systems can not be examined experimentally , because the out - of- plane orientational and positional freedoms are always present to some extent .",
    "therefore it is desirable to extend the theoretical studies in such directions , where the extra orientational and positional freedoms are present . along this line",
    ", the ordering properties of microtubules confined in a thin slit have been modeled as hard spherocylinders placed between two planar walls in [ 28 ] . in agreement with the experiment",
    "it has been found that the isotropic - nematic transition density increases with the wall separation [ 28 ] .",
    "ellipsoidal shaped colloidal particles are gaining widespread applications due to development of the stretching techniques in preparation of monodisperse prolate and oblate ellipsoids from spherical latex particles [ 4,38 ] .",
    "they can be also confined into planar geometry and create a monolayer to study ordering and glassy behavior of the q2d ellipsoid systems [ 12,13 ] .    in this paper",
    "we examine the orientational ordering properties of q2d hard ellipsoid systems , where particles are allowed to rotate out the confinement plane to some extent , while it is assumed in first approximation that the centers of the particles are always in the same plane . switching on the out - of - plane orientational freedom by gradual increase ( decrease ) of the limiting polar angle ( @xmath0 ) for oblate ( prolate ) shapes ,",
    "it is possible to make a link between strictly 2d hard ellipse ( hard disk ) systems for prolate ( oblate ) shapes and q2d freely rotating prolate ( oblate ) ellipsoids systems .",
    "we show that the additional out - of - plane orientational freedom changes substantially the orientational ordering and the transition properties of both oblate and prolate shaped ellipsoids . to maximize the available free area on the confining surface ,",
    "the axis of revolution of the prolate particle leans out from the plane , while the oblate particle leans into the plane . as a consequence , the freely rotating prolate ellipsoids resemble hard disks at high densities , while those of oblate ellipsoids behave similarly to hard ellipses .",
    "the isotropic - nematic phase transition of hard ellipses corresponds to a planar nematic - biaxial nematic phase transition of the oblate ellipsoids . here",
    "we note that our present work can be considered as an extension of our previous studies done for monolayers of uniaxial and biaxial hard particles using restricted - orientation approximation [ 39,40 ] .",

    "the arrows indicate the direction of the main symmetry axis of the ellipsoids . ]    in this work we examine the q2d system of hard ellipsoids , where the particles are allowed to rotate freely in a restricted region of the solid angle , while the centers of particles can move only on a two - dimensional xy plane .",
    "the shape of the particles can be both prolate and oblate , i.e. the aspect ratio or shape anisotropy ( @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the lengths along and perpendicular to the axis of revolution of the ellipsoid , respectively ) can be either larger than one ( @xmath4 , prolate shape ) or between zero and one ( @xmath5 , oblate shape ) .",
    "the orientational restriction takes place only in the polar angle ( @xmath6 ) , which is measured from the axis of revolution of each particle to the normal of the confining xy plane .",
    "while the particles can rotate freely in the azimuthal angle ( @xmath7 ) , the allowed range of the polar angle is different for prolate and oblate ellipsoids , namely , the range of the polar angle is given by @xmath8 for prolate shapes , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 intervals are allowed for oblate ones ( see fig .",

    "the situation is different for oblate ellipsoids ( @xmath5 ) , because the hard disk limit is given by @xmath12 , while the freely rotating system of confined oblate ellipsoids corresponds to @xmath13 .",
    "the interaction between ellipsoids is purely hard , i.e. the pair potential between two particles is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the center - to - center distance , @xmath16 is the unit vector connecting the centers of the two ellipsoids , @xmath17 is the orientational unit vector of particle @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 is the distance of closest approach . note that the third component of @xmath21 is always zero , which ensures that the centers of the particles are always in the xy plane .",
    "the distance of closest approach between two ellipsoids [ @xmath20 ] is approximated in the manner proposed in our previous works [ 41,42 ] .",
    "to describe theoretically the orientational ordering properties of the monolayer of hard ellipsoids we derive our working equations from the well - known parsons - lee ( pl ) theory of hard bodies [ 43,44 ] , which proved very successful in determination of the equation of state and the transition properties of in phase coexistence of non - spherical hard body fluids both in two [ 23,24 ] and three dimensions [ 45 - 47 ] . here",
    "we present only the important ingredients of the theory , specific equations for the ellipsoid monolayer and some technical details .",
    "it is customary to deal with the free energy of the system , which is the sum of ideal and excess free energy terms , i.e. @xmath23 . the ideal term can be determined exactly from @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the inverse temperature , @xmath26 is the number of particles , @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the area of the plane , @xmath29 is the collection azimuthal and polar angles , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the normalized orientational distribution function ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the ranges of the azimuthal and polar angles in the integrations have been already given in sec .",
    "the excess free energy contribution can be obtained approximately with the mapping procedure from the actual system to a reference one , where the second virial coefficient and the excess free energy can be obtained with good accuracy . in our case",
    "we choose the system of 2d hard disks as a reference system , because our confined ellipsoid system is q2d .",
    "the second virial coefficient of the hard disks is given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the diameter of the hard disk .",
    "a luckily simple and accurate expression can be derived for the excess free energy of hard disks , too , using the scaled particle theory [ 48 ] @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the packing fraction of the hard disk and @xmath37 is the area of the hard disk . to perform the mapping procedure from the hard ellipsoids into hard disks we introduce the surface coverage ( or packing fraction ) of the hard ellipsoids , because the intersection of the ellipsoid with the xy plane is an ellipse with characteristic lengths depending on the orientation of the ellipsoid .",
    "these characteristic lengths of the ellipse can be calculated easily using simple geometry .",
    "one can derive that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath6 is the polar angle of the ellipsoid .",
    "this means that the monolayer of the hard ellipsoids can be visualized as a multicomponent mixture of hard ellipses on the xy plane . using the dimensions of the hard ellipse ,",
    "the intersected area of the hard ellipsoid with the xy plane can be obtained from @xmath40 this polar angle dependent area together with the orientational distribution function allows us to determine the surface coverage of the plane by ellipses , which is given by @xmath41 , where the average area of the intersected ellipse can be determined from @xmath42 .",
    "note that the surface coverage gives back the packing fraction of hard disks in the hard - sphere limit , because @xmath43 and the distribution function is a constant . in pl approach the area of hard disks and the average area of hard ellipses are assumed to be the same ( @xmath44 ) , which implies also that @xmath45 due to one - to - one correspondence between the two systems .",

    "note that the minimization must be carried out by maintaining the normalization condition ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "although the minimization procedure is very simple and straightforward , we do not present the equation of @xmath31 , since the resulting equation is too long .",

    "starting with prolates ellipsoids , one can see that the particles do not form an isotropic phase , but they align along the normal of the xy plane ( see the simulation snapshot of fig . [ fig4 ] ) even at very low densities .",
    "in fact , an isotropic phase would appear only at the limit of infinite dilution .",
    "the density dependence of the surface coverage and the effective aspect ratio shows that the particles have less and less chance to lie into the xy surface with increasing density because of packing effects .",
    "the intersection of the ellipsoid with the xy surface is practically a hard disk for @xmath89 , where the effective ellipse aspect ratio is almost one .",

    "the resulting in - plane ordering can be seen in the simulation snapshot and from the high density behavior of the effective aspect ratio ( @xmath94 ) .",

    "this in - plane order is isotropic at low densities ( @xmath83 ) , while it is nematic at high densities ( @xmath84 ) .",

    "the order of the uniaxial nematic - biaxial nematic ( n - bn ) phase transition is proved to be second order in the approximate pl theory , while the transition is higher order continuous in the simulation .",
    "this transition is the result of the competition between in - plane orientational entropy ( favoring disorder ) and the in - plane packing entropy ( favoring order ) . the high density structure of the hard ellipsoid monolayer resembles the nematic phase of the 2d hard ellipses , while at low densities the structure more or less corresponds to an isotropic phase of a polydisperse mixture of hard ellipses .",
    "one can also see that the agreement between the theory and the simulation is quite good for oblate ellipsoids , especially with respect to the equation of state .",

    "[ fig6 ] shows the in - plane isotropic - nematic ( or n - bn ) transition densities as a function of aspect ratio resulting from the pl theory and simulation . on the other hand ,",

    "the agreement for the transition densities is again very good between the theory and simulation . to see the effect of out - of - plane orientational freedom it is worth plotting the in densities of 2d hard ellipse system and those of freely rotating hard oblate monolayer together ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "it can bee seen that the simulation does not show a substantial difference between the two systems , while the theory predicts that the out - of - plane freedom destabilizes the nematic order , i.e. the in density curve is shifted into the direction of higher densities . in the simulation",
    "the nematic phase evolves from a very ordered planar phase ( isotropic in the xy plane ) , where the effective aspect ratio is almost identical with the aspect ratio of the ellipsoids ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , i.e. the corresponding hard ellipse system is almost monodisperse .",
    "this is not the case in the theory , where the transition happens at such densities , where the corresponding hard ellipse system is still polydisperse with larger shape anisotropy ( @xmath87 ) than @xmath74 . as a result",
    "the effect of out - of - plane orientational freedom is more pronounced in the theory than in the simulation .",
    "this shows that the theory exaggerates the effect of out - of - plane orientational freedom on the n - bn phase transition .",
    "finally we show how the in transition properties change with switching on the out of plane orientational freedom through the varying limiting polar angle ( @xmath0 ) , which is between 0 and @xmath11 for both prolate and oblate shapes .",
    "if @xmath13 ( @xmath98 ) the prolate ellipsoids on the xy plane behave like the system of hard ellipses , i.e. they undergo a 2d in phase transition with increasing density ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "however this phase transition is destabilized with decreasing the limiting angle ( @xmath0 ) , which corresponds to increasing @xmath99 . as the orientational window",
    "is widened ( decreasing @xmath0 ) , the prolate ellipsoids tend to minimize their occupied area on the xy surface , which results in less anisotropic in - plane ellipses and higher transition densities for all studied aspect ratios .",
    "in addition to this , the in - plane order transforms continuously into out - of - plane order , i.e. s becomes positive with @xmath99 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "hence , the 2d in transitions turn into n - bn transitions for confined prolates which are lost for the free rotating case . the surface coverage ( packing fraction )",
    "curves show very clearly that the occupied area on the xy surface increases enormously with decreasing the polar angle restriction , i.e. the 2d in phase transition is destabilized with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "the value of @xmath0 where the orientational ordering transition is preempted by the positional one ( freezing transition ) can not be determined with the present pl theory .",
    "interestingly , mc simulation shows that the in density is practically not affected by the value of limiting polar angle , but the transition disappears at values of @xmath0 close to zero .",
    "note that the in transition density curves move into the direction of lower densities with increasing shape anisotropy because the occupied area of the ellipsoids becomes larger with increasing @xmath74 as @xmath100 .",
    "the case of oblate ellipsoids is different because @xmath13 corresponds to the freely rotating limit , while @xmath12 is the hard disk limit .",
    "starting from the freely rotating case one can see that the in transition density shows a maximum at an intermediate value of @xmath0 , which can be attributed to the combined effect of decreasing in - plane shape anisotropy and the increasing intersected area of the ellipsoids with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "the n - bn transition packing fraction behaves simply since it is always an increasing function of @xmath99 , i.e the nematic phase is destabilized .",
    "this means that the nematic - biaxial nematic curve and the isotropic - solid curves must cross each other at a threshold value of @xmath99 making the nematic order metastable and producing a plastic solid ( an orientationally disordered solid ) .",
    "this plastic solid would eventually turn into an ordered solid at higher densities .",
    "however , this value of @xmath99 has not been searched by the simulation and theory , because our study focuses only on the orientational ordering .",
    "finally , the @xmath56 order parameter shows that the system undergoes a structural change from in - plane order into out - of - plane order at the n - bn transition .",

    "we have examined the orientational ordering properties of the monolayer of hard ellipsoids using replica exchange monte carlo simulation method and the parsons - lee density functional theory .",
    "we have found that both the shape anisotropy and the orientational restriction affect substantially the orientational order on the plane . the subtle interplay between orientational and packing entropies results in different structures and phase behaviors for prolate and",
    "oblate shaped ellipsoids .",
    "the main driving force of the ordering behavior is to minimize the intersected area between the particle and the surface to realize the close packing structure with increasing surface density .",
    "the minimal intersected area is a disk for prolate , while it is an ellipse for oblate ellipsoids .",
    "highly packed structures can be achieved with only out - of - plane ( in - plane ) ordering for prolate ( oblate ) ellipsoids , i.e. prolate ellipsoids prefer to order along the normal of the plane , while oblate ellipsoids like to order in the plane .",
    "the monolayer of prolate ellipsoids with very small out - of - plane orientational freedom behaves almost identically to the system of 2d hard ellipses , i.e. it form 2d isotropic and nematic phases .",
    "the gradual rise of the out - of - plane freedom , through decreasing @xmath0 , allows the ellipsoid particle to lean out from the plane and to decrease the intersected area with the plane .",
    "this involves less anisotropic shape in the interactions and destabilization of the biaxial nematic phase ( 2d nematic ) with respect to uniaxial nematic one ( 2d isotropic ) . at full orientational freedom ( @xmath101 ) prolate ellipsoids",
    "do not form an isotropic phase , but they are ordered along the normal of the confining plane even at very low densities and behave similarly to the 2d system of hard disks at high densities .",
    "the monolayer of oblate ellipsoids without out - of - plane freedom is identical to the 2d system of hard disks .",
    "the gradually increasing freedom in polar angle ( @xmath6 ) allows the oblate ellipsoid to decrease its intersected area with the confining plane through leaning out from the plane .",
    "this makes the ordering planar for the main symmetry axis of the ellipsoid .",
    "however the anisotropic interactions between the tilted ellipsoids give rise to an additional in - plane order , i.e. the phase is biaxial nematic , which is due to the excluded area gain coming from the in - plane ordering of elliptical intersections . in the freely rotating case the oblate ellipsoids form a planar nematic phase at low densities and a biaxial nematic one at high densities .",
    "interestingly , the in density of 2d ellipses is almost identical to that of freely rotating ellipsoids confined to a plane . in summary the out - of - plane orientational freedom",
    "stabilizes the in - plane nematic ordering in the monolayer of oblate ellipsoids , while the opposite happens in the monolayer of prolate ellipsoids .",
    "this is congruent with the 2d ellipse and 2d disk phase diagrams , which are obtained as limiting cases in this study . in our simple model",
    "we have neglected the effect of out - of - plane positional freedom which we expect to have a relatively small effect on the system behavior . on the other hand ,",
    "not including a soft wall - particle interaction may lead to deviations from experimental set - ups where capillary phenomena are frequently important .",
    "no doubt , the inclusion of this interaction would substantially increase the computation burden of the problem .",
    "we leave this issue for future studies .",
