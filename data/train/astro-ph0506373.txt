    "many models of the inflation have been proposed .",
    "multi - field inflation is a natural alternative model to the standard single field inflaton model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in such the multi - field inflation model , the isocurvature perturbation arises in addition to the adiabatic one , though the evolution of the isocurvature perturbations is model - dependent .",
    "testing predictions of these inflation models will be the subject of the ( future ) precision cosmology by confronting with observation .",
    "statistics of the primordial fluctuations is very important in such the test of the inflation models . in particular , the non - gaussian nature of the primordial fluctuations",
    "is considered to be an important clue @xcite , which stimulates the recent investigations on the higher order cosmological perturbations @xcite .",
    "the stochastic inflation was developed by starobinsky and many works have been done @xcite .",
    "the stochastic approach to inflation is useful in investigating the statistics of the fluctuations @xcite . in the stochastic inflation , the field dynamics",
    "coarse - grained over the horizon size is described by the langevin equation , and the field value of the inflaton is the probability variable . instead of solving the langevin equation",
    ", we may solve the corresponding fokker - planck equation , which describes the evolution of the probability function @xmath0 .",
    "it is known that the scaling approximation is useful to describe the evolution of the probability function during the slow - roll period @xcite . with the use of the scaling approximation",
    ", the probability function can be obtained analytically @xcite .",
    "the stochastic approach to the multi - field inflation has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the probability function for the multi - field inflation was constructed using the scaling approximation in an analytic manner by amendola @xcite .",
    "however , the constructed probability function does not have the symmetry in exchanging the field parameters .",
    "such the symmetry is desired for a consistency of the theory . as an extension of this previous work ,",
    "we develop a useful analytic formula for the probability function of the multi - field stochastic inflation using the scaling approximation .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows : in section 2 , we summarize the stochastic approach to the multi - field inflation .",
    "then we obtain the probability distribution function using the scaling approximation as an extension of the work by amendola @xcite . in section 3 ,",
    "based on the probability function , we investigate the non - gaussian feature of the scalar fields during the inflation by decomposing the scalar fields into the adiabatic and the isocurvature components . in section 4 ,",
    "we mention about connecting our result with observation .",
    "section 5 is devoted to summary and conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we use the unit @xmath1 , and follow the convention @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the chaotic inflation model with the two scalar fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 with the lagrangian density @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the potential , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the non - dimensional coupling constants , @xmath11 is the parameter , and we introduced @xmath12 . during the slow - role regime , neglecting the kinetic terms , the friedman equation gives @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hubble parameters , @xmath15 is the scale factor , the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath16 .",
    "we adopt the stochastic approach to the inflation .",
    "the basic equation , the langevin equation , is obtained by coarse - graining the field , averaging over the short wave length modes of the evolution equation of the field operator .",
    "for the two - field inflation , we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 describes the stochastic noises , which have the nature of the morkovian gaussian noise with zero mean and the correlation @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote @xmath19 and @xmath20 . thus the long - range scalar fields during the slow - roll regime are described by the langevin equations with the classical drift force @xmath24 or @xmath25 and the noise whose amplitude is in proportion to @xmath26 .",
    "note that , even if the field potentials consist of independent function of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the dynamics is coupled to each other because the hubble parameter @xmath29 depends on the both fields . note that we have assumed @xmath30 , based on the assumption that the fine - grained component of the field @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be treated as free in the leading approximation @xcite .",
    "then , we may assume the langevin equations for these field with the gaussian noise with the correlation @xmath31 , in a similar way to the single field stochastic inflation .",
    "however , this assumption might be oversimplified for the models with general coupling between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    here",
    "let us consider the background solution for the langevin equation without the noise term , @xmath32 from these zero - noise field equations , we have @xmath33 which gives the attractor solution , assuming that the classical paths converge to it after a short transient , @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "in the present paper , we refer to the attractor solution as the classical solution .",
    "we will solve the fokker - planck equation corresponding to the langevin equation , along the classical attractor trajectory .",
    "for the latter convenience , we introduce the parameter @xmath36 by @xmath37    our formulation relies on rewriting the langevin equation in term of the variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 , introduced in the below , instead of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "first , we define the variable @xmath38 by @xmath40 from the langevin equation for @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we may write @xmath41 where @xmath29 should be regarded as @xmath42 with defined @xmath43 the approximation of equation ( [ aph ] ) is similar to that in @xcite . in the strict sense , @xmath29 is the function of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , but , in equation ( [ aph ] ) , @xmath29 is approximated as @xmath44 .",

    ".    it will be important to mention about the physical meanings of the variable @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath38 is the variable parallel to the classical trajectory . on the other hand @xmath39",
    "can be regarded to represent the component perpendicular to the classical trajectory .",
    "it is worthy to note that the cross correlation of the noise terms in the langevin equations @xmath38 and @xmath39 is zero , i.e. , @xmath47    now we consider solving the fokker - planck equation corresponding to the langevin equations for @xmath38 ( and @xmath39 ) . to find the solution analytically",
    ", we adopt the scaling approximation , which was done in reference @xcite for single inflaton models . in the slow - roll regime of inflation , the drift force dominates the dynamical evolution of the scalar fields , and the quantum noise is small . then the coarse - grained probability distribution develops a sharp peak around the classical slow - roll solution .",
    "this is the basic background that the scaling approximation may be used to describe the behavior of the probability distribution in the slow - roll regime .",
    "the langevin equation for @xmath38 is similar to that for the single field inflaton model , and we follow the reference @xcite to find the analytic solution with the technique of the scaling approximation . in appendix",
    "a , the derivation of the probability function is described .",

    "we mention about the boundary condition of the probability distribution function .",
    "the reflecting boundary condition , with which the normalization of the probability is preserved , is adopted in usual . in this case , other reflective term should be added to the probability function .",
    "however , as long as we are concerning with the behavior of the probability function around the peak of the classical slow - roll solution , we may work with the solution ( [ psc ] ) practically .",
    "figure 1 shows the contours of the probability function to make an example of its time evolution . at the earlier time",
    "( left panel ) , the probability function is almost spherically distributed . at the middle time ( center panel ) , the probability function becomes rather broad , then it becomes elongated along the direction of the classical path at the latter time ( right panel ) .",
    "the behavior depends on the model parameters as well as the initial condition .",
    "in this section we investigate the evolution of the probability function ( [ psc ] ) , focusing on the non - gaussian statistical nature .",
    "we start from introducing the variable @xmath55 and @xmath56 by @xmath57 we may regard @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) as the component that contributes to the adiabatic ( isocurvature ) perturbation @xcite .",
    "we rewrite the probability distribution function in terms of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the expansion can be done in a straightforward manner .",
    "but the expression is rather long , then the result is given in appendix b.    here let us introduce the @xmath58-folding number from a time @xmath16 to the final time of the inflation @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath59 is defined by @xmath61 , which gives @xmath62 . instead of using @xmath16 ( or @xmath63 )",

    "this is consistent with the behavior of the probability function shown in figure 1 .",
    "we next consider the deviation of the probability function from the gaussian statistics , which is expressed by the terms in proportion of @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and the other higher order terms . to investigate the deviation of the probability distribution function from the gaussian statistics quantitatively",
    ", we first define the ratio @xmath79 thus @xmath80 represents the asymmetry of the probability function , which can be related to the dimensionless skewness ( see below ) . in the limit of the gaussian statistics , @xmath81 approaches to zero .",
    "this is a very simple but useful estimator of the local skewness around the gaussian peak introduced in reference @xcite . from our probability function , we have the expression of the leading order @xmath82 , \\label{nong}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is defined by ( [ gamman ] ) .",
    "our result of the adiabatic component with @xmath85 reproduces the result in reference @xcite .",
    "we can read a few characteristic features of the skewness from expression ( [ nong ] ) .",
    "first , the evolution of the skewness , in general , depends on the parameters of the potential .",
    "it also depends on the initial time @xmath86 , which we have adopted to solve the fokker - planck equation .",
    "this is unavoidable in our scheme .",
    "let us consider the skewness of the adiabatic component , the first term of the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of ( [ nong ] ) . to estimate the skewness quantitatively , we consider the first term at the one sigma deviation with respect to @xmath55 , with replacing @xmath87 by @xmath88 , @xmath89 in the similar way , considering the second term of ( r.h.s . ) of ( [ nong ] ) at the one sigma deviation with respect to @xmath56 , with replacing @xmath90 by @xmath91 , we define @xmath92 figure 3 plots @xmath93 and @xmath94 as function of @xmath64 for the models @xmath95 , and @xmath96 and @xmath97 . for the model @xmath98 , we have @xmath99 because @xmath100 . here",
    "we extensively used our result to the case @xmath101 .",
    "we see that @xmath94 is larger than @xmath93 for the model @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "figure 4 plots the same as figure 3 but with @xmath85 .",
    "similarly , figures 5 and 6 are same as figure 3 but with @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively . from figures 3 - 6",
    ", we see that the non - gaussian estimator @xmath93 and @xmath94 becomes larger as @xmath11 becomes larger , in general , depending on @xmath104 .",
    "but the ratio of @xmath94 to @xmath93 becomes large as @xmath11 becomes small .",
    "this comes from the fact that the skewness of the isocurvature component @xmath94 is in proportion to @xmath84 .",
    "figure 7 plots the ratio @xmath105 at a fixed time as function of @xmath106 for various models of @xmath11 .",
    "this result demonstrates that the skewness of the isocurvature component is independent of the adiabatic component , and can be large compared to the adiabatic one .",
    "the asymmetry in the two potentials enhances the non - gaussianity of the isocurvature component . in reference",
    "@xcite , the importance of the non - gaussianity of the isocurvature component was discussed in a different context of the investigation of multi - field inflation .",
    "the third term of the r.h.s . of ( [ nong ] ) represents the mixing of the isocurvature and the adiabatic components .",
    "this suggests that the adiabatic and isocurvature components may have a correlation at nonlinear order in general , even if it have no correlation at the linear order @xcite .",
    "similar to the skewness , the terms in proportion to @xmath107 and @xmath108 represent the local kurtosis of the probability function .",
    "it can be read that the coefficient of @xmath108 depends on @xmath84 but the coefficient of @xmath107 does not .",
    "this means that , similar to the case of the skewness , the kurtosis of the isocurvature component is independent of the adiabatic component and can be large compared to it .",
    "here let us briefly mention about the detectability of the skewness and kurtosis .",
    "as mentioned in section 1 , many works related to the non - gaussian nature of the primordial fluctuations have been done .",
    "the useful quantity @xmath109 is introduced to characterize the non - gaussianity of the gravitational potential @xmath110 , by expanding it as @xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a zero - mean gaussian probability variable . here",
    "assume @xmath112 and @xmath110 are the variables with one degree of freedom , it is easy to construct the probability distribution function of @xmath110 , @xmath113 , \\label{pphi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] neglecting the terms proportional to @xmath114 .",
    "by @xmath110 to eliminate the term proportional to @xmath110 . ]",
    "then we define the local skewness for the probability function @xmath115 , in the similar way to the previous section , by @xmath116 we can write @xmath117 in terms of the dimensionless skewness defined by @xmath118 .",
    "approximating the probability function as @xmath119 \\simeq \\left(1+f_{nl}{\\phi^3\\over\\left<\\phi^2\\right>}\\right ) \\exp\\left [ -{\\phi^2\\over 2\\left<\\phi^2\\right>}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have @xmath120    in general , the evolution of fluctuations depends on each model .",
    "however , we here introduce the assumption that the dimensionless skewness preserves , that is @xmath121 , even if the amplitude of the fluctuations may change during the evolution of the universe . based on this assumption",
    "our result can be connected with observation . in this case",
    "the predicted local skewness is related to @xmath122 as @xmath123 if we adopt @xmath124 , the vertical axis of figures 3 - 6 can be read as @xmath125 .",
    "the detectable minimum value of @xmath122 is discussed in references @xcite , @xmath126 and @xmath127 for wmap and planck data , respectively .",
    "thus the non - gaussianity in our model with @xmath128 might be detectable .",
    "however , this is based on the rough estimation because we have not strictly considered the observational constraint on the model parameters from the spectrum index and the amplitude of the perturbation . for definite conclusions we need",
    "incorporate these constraints .",
    "similar to the skewness , we can estimate the local kurtosis , being of order @xmath129 .",
    "this is smaller than the skewness by a factor of @xmath130 .",
    "in the present paper , we have investigated the statistical nature of the multi - field inflation with the stochastic approach , in which the evolution of the scalar fields is described by the langevin equations . to solve the corresponding fokker - planck equation analytically",
    ", we adopt the technique of the scaling approximation .",
    "this was first considered in @xcite .",
    "we have improved the previous investigation requiring the probability function to have the symmetry in exchanging the field parameters .",
    "we have investigated the non - gaussian nature of the probability function by decomposing the fields into the adiabatic and the isocurvature components .",
    "we have introduced the local skewness as an estimator of the non - gaussianity , and have found the followings : ( 1 ) the amplitude of the skewness is determined by the combination of the coupling constant @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the amplitude of the skewness of the adiabatic component is determined by the combination of the coupling constant @xmath104 and @xmath11 , while that of the isocurvature component depends on @xmath104 , @xmath11 and the ratio of the coupling constant @xmath84 .",
    "then the skewness of the isocurvature component can be large compared with that of the adiabatic one due to the factor @xmath84 .",
    "( 2 ) the similar feature can be seen in the kurtosis of the adiabatic and isocurvature components .",
    "( 3 ) the adiabatic and isocurvature components may have correlation at the nonlinear order in the skewness and kurtosis , even if there is no correlation at the linear order .",
    "we have considered the connection between our result and observation , based on the assumption that the dimensionless skewness of fluctuation is preserved .",
    "this argument shows that the skewness will be useful to constrain the potential parameter .",
    "however the assumption is not trivial and there remains room for more discussions for precise comparison with observation .",
    "furthermore , in the present paper , we have only worked with the simple chaotic inflation models with the power - low potentials .",
    "investigation of multi - field inflation with more general potentials will be an interesting subject , including the confrontation with cosmic microwave anisotropy observation .",
    "testing the robustness of the approximation adopted here will also be required as a future investigation .",
