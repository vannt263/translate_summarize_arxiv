    "the data collection protocol was approved by the emory university institutional animal care and use committee and all data were collected in accordance with its guidelines for the ethical treatment of nonhuman study subjects .",
    "the data were collected by jcf in 1998 from a large group of captive pigtailed macaques ( _ macaca nemestrina _ ) socially - housed at the yerkes national primate center in lawrenceville , georgia .",
    "pigtailed macaques are indigenous to south east asia and live in multi - male , multi - female societies characterized by female matrilines and male group transfer upon onset of puberty  @xcite .",
    "pigtailed macaques breed all year .",
    "females develop swellings when in strus .",
    "macaque societies more generally are characterized by social learning at the individual level , social structures that arise from nonlinear processes and feed back to influence individual behavior , frequent non - kin interactions and multiplayer conflict interactions , the cost and benefits of which can be quantified at the individual and social network levels  @xcite .",
    "the study group contained @xmath24 socially - mature individuals ( we exclude non - mature individuals because their behavioral strategies are still developing and so are non - stationary over short timescales ) and 84 individuals in total .",
    "socially - mature males were at least 48 months and socially - mature females were at least 36 months by study start . these thresholds correspond to approximate onset of social maturity in pigtailed macaques .",
    "the study group had a demographic structure approximating wild populations and subadult and adult males were regularly removed to mimic emigration occurring in wild populations .",
    "all individuals , except 8 ( 4 males , 4 females ) , were either natal to the group or had been in the group since formation .",
    "the group was housed in an indoor - outdoor facility , the outdoor compound of which was 125 x 65 ft .",
    "pigtailed macaques have frequent conflict and employ targeted intervention and repair strategies for managing conflict @xcite .",
    "data on social dynamics and conflict were collected from this group over a stable , four month period .",
    "operational definitions are provided below in si sec.[op ] .",
    "_ fight _ : includes any interaction in which one individual threatens or aggresses a second individual .",
    "a conflict was considered terminated if no aggression or withdrawal response ( fleeing , crouching , screaming , running away , submission signals ) was exhibited by any of the conflict participants for _ two minutes _ from the last such event .",
    "a fight can involve multiple individuals .",
    "third parties can become involved in pair - wise conflict through intervention or redirection , or when a family member of a conflict participant attacks a fourth - party .",
    "fights in this data set ranged in size from 2 to 31 individuals , counting only the socially - mature animals .",
    "fights can be represented as small networks that grow and shrink as pair - wise and triadic interactions become active or terminate until there are no more individuals fighting under the above described two minute criterion .",
    "in addition to aggressors , a conflict can include individuals who show no aggression or submission ( _ e.g. _ third - parties who simply approach the conflict or show affiliative / submissive behavior upon approaching , and recipients of aggression who show no response to aggression ( typically , threats ) by another individual ) .",
    "because conflicts involve multiple actors , two or more individuals can participate in the same conflict but not interact directly .    in this study",
    "only information about fight composition ( which individuals were involved ) is used .",
    "only fights that included two or more socially - mature individuals were used in the analysis ; the data includes @xmath25 such fights .",
    "we do not consider internal aspects of the fight , such as who does what to whom , except for the order of each individual s first involvement in the fight ( used to estimate time - ordered conditional probabilities for use in the dynamical branching process model ) .",
    "time data were collected on fight onset and termination but are not used in these analyses .",
    "_ power _ : the degree of consensus among individuals in the group about whether an individual is capable of using force successfully  @xcite . in previous works",
    "we showed that consensus can be quantified by taking into account the total number of subordination signals an individual receives and multiplying this quantity by a measure of the diversity of signals received from its population of signalers ( quantified by computing the shannon entropy of the vector of signals received by individual _ i _ ) @xcite .",
    "in pigtailed macaque societies , the subordination signal is the silent bared teeth display  @xcite emitted outside the conflict context during pass - byes and affiliative interactions .",
    "the distribution of power in our study group is heavy tailed , such that a few individuals are disproportionately powerful .    _",
    "policing _ : a policing intervention is an impartial intervention performed by a third party into an ongoing conflict  @xcite .",
    "three males and one female perform the majority of effective policing interventions but only the three males ( eo , qs , fo ) specialize on policing  @xcite .",
    "these four individuals occupy the top four spots in the power distribution  @xcite .",
    "_ redirection _ : a redirection occurs when an aggressor , recipient , or intervener directs aggression at a third ( or fourth ) individual who was not its original target or attacker . the target of the redirection may not have been involved in the fight until the redirection , or may have been involved in the fight but interacting with individuals other than the redirecting individual .",
    "the data were collected by a trained observer ( j.c .",
    "the observer spent roughly 100 hours prior to data collection learning to recognize individuals and accurately code their behavior from the observation tower above the monkey compound .",
    "accuracy was validated by a second trained observer ( f.b.m .",

    "jcf also evaluated coding accuracy using video .",
    "coding accuracy was nearly 100@xmath26 .    during observations all individuals",
    "were confined to the outdoor portion of the compound and were visible to the observer .",
    "the @xmath27 hours of observations occurred for up to eight hours daily between 1,100 and 2,000 hours over a twenty - week period from june through october 1998 , and were evenly distributed over the day . conflict and signaling data were collected using all - occurrence sampling in which the entire conflict event is followed from start to finish and all participants and their behavior are recorded .",
    "provisioning occurred before observations and once during observations at approximately the same time each day .",
    "the group was stable during the data collection period ( defined as no reversals in status signaling interactions resulting in a change to an individual s power score ; see ref .",
    "we first evaluate which of three basic , empirically - grounded fight joining models explain our macroscopic observable , the distribution of fight sizes .",
    "we only accept a model if it is both consistent with the measured , microscopic data and can recover in simulation the observed , measured macroscopic output . hence all of our models are closely tethered to the measured data and biological details of our model system .",
    "it is important to realize that the parameters in the maximum entropy and branching models come from the microscopic data .",
    "the models do not assume prescribed values for parameters but are perhaps better viewed as hypotheses about the ways in which the measured , microscopic detail is connected to observed macroscopic patterns .",
    "all models assume that events external to the system do not create correlations in behavior .",
    "the data were collected in a controlled , captive setting designed to minimize the influence of external events , and we have no evidence for important , consistent external forcers of conflict .",
    "the independent model assumes individuals do not respond to each other but instead join fights without regard to who else is fighting . in this case",
    ", perturbations to individual conflict behavior would have no additional effect on group behavior .",
    "the independent model fails to recover both the observed distribution of fight sizes ( fig .",
    "[ fightsizedistributions ] ) and the observed significant pairwise correlations ( fig .",
    "[ isingstatistics ] ) .",
    "individuals sometimes randomly join fights and sometimes the decision to fight reflects strategic interactions at a pairwise level@xcite .",
    "we capture this interpretation of the microscopic data using a maximum entropy approach , which corresponds to the spin - glass model of magnetic systems in physics . because the model is parameterized by the data it is empirically grounded and serves as a valid biological hypothesis .",
    "however we note that it is less mechanistically specific than the branching process described below : spin - glass interactions are not directional or time - ordered , but rather operate symmetrically and over the timescale of an entire fight bout .",
    "the pairwise maximum entropy model , with parameters fit from the microscopic data , recovers well the distribution of fight sizes ( fig .",
    "[ fightsizedistributions ] ) .",
    "the good performance of the model leads to the prediction that the sensitivity @xmath15 is about twice that of a system with the same conflict frequencies but no strategic interactions .",
    "another reasonable interpretation of the microscopic data is that the random component of fight joining decisions is very small and the decision to fight reflects strategic interactions at a pairwise level .",
    "this leads to a branching process model that , with parameters fit from the microscopic data , also recovers the observed distribution of fight sizes .",
    "the collective behavior produced by this model can be simply understood in terms of a single parameter , the branching ratio .",
    "additionally , branching process models like this one have been used in previous work to explore other aspects of conflict dynamics in this system , including the role of policing and other forms of third - party intervention in the infectivity of aggression @xcite .",
    "the independent model consists of individuals participating in conflict randomly , with the frequencies of individual appearance equal to their empirically measured , heterogeneous values @xmath28 .",
    "naively , this can be written as a relative negative log - likelihood of state @xmath29 is related to the likelihood @xmath30 by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a normalization constant set by the constraint that the sum of likelihoods over all states is one . in statistical physics",

    "correspondingly , we forbid our models from producing fights of size smaller than two .",
    "we treat this as an additional constraint on the model .",

    ", we use a simplified method that starts with the mean field solution and varies a single parameter corresponding to weighting a non - interacting prior .",
    "specifically , we make use of the @xmath61-regularized mean field entropy of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the regularization consists of a gaussian prior with a form designed to make the mean - field case easily solvable , corresponding to an additional term in the relative negative log likelihood @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the strength of the prior , which favors interactions @xmath4 that are smaller in magnitude .",

    "avoiding overfitting , however , still typically requires either enormous @xmath58 ( e.g.  @xcite ) or restricting the effective number of fit parameters via an expansion ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in our case , @xmath58 is fundamentally limited in that we are describing a stable social epoch of finite duration .",
    "in addition , typical high - temperature expansions can not easily incorporate the restriction that fights have a minimum number of participants [ the @xmath75 term in eq .",

    "phase transitions are typically identified as conditions under which the varying of a control parameter causes large - scale changes in the behavior of a system , in a way that sensitivity per individual ( measured by , _",
    "e.g. _ , specific heat or susceptibility ) grows arbitrarily large with growing system size .",
    "this becomes possible only when there is a collective instability , meaning that the effective size of the perturbation ( that starts , say , with a single individual ) does not shrink as it spreads through the system but stays of constant size or grows ( potentially affecting all individuals ) .",
    "thus in a finite system , the combination of a peak in sensitivity and collective instability can be used as an indicator of a phase - transition - like state .      in our finite system",
    "the notion of diverging sensitivity is arguably more accurately described in terms of information theory .",

    "this also corresponds to the point at which the system is maximally sensitive to changes in parameters .",
    "the fact that this `` local '' amplification factor is also indicative of a global transition relies on the infinite limit : in a finite system , cascades will be shortened when they reach individuals that have already been activated , and maximal sensitivity will happen at some @xmath103 @xcite .",

    "the sensitivity scores generated by each model are capturing different underlying tuning mechanisms . in the case of the branching process model ,",
    "the model captures the spread of fight - joining through direct interactions : one individual through its behavior triggers the involvement of a second individual .",
    "hence this model only allows that the target individuals , through their own fight joining decisions , can up or down regulate their fight involvement .",
    "when a high sensitivity individual up or down regulates its own behavior moving the system respectively closer to or further from the critical point , we call this _ direct tuning_.    the equilibrium model , on the other hand , is agnostic to cause , recording any pairwise correlation in fight joining regardless of which individual triggered the joining event .",
    "as such it captures the full space of behavioral mechanisms leading to fight - joining  individuals can become involved in fights by up regulating their own fight involvement and _ also _ through changes to third - party behavior .",
    "for example , policing ( by third - parties to the fight ) and other conflict management mechanisms reduce the frequency of redirected and directed aggression in the system , and as such can dampen the fight joining behavior of the target individual . when a third party , like a policer , up or down regulates the behavior of high sensitivity individuals we call this _",
    "indirect tuning_.      a natural question raised by the discoveries that dfc can be tuned and that there are behavioral mechanisms in place that in principle allow this tuning is whether to tune towards robustness ( increase dfc ) or criticality ( decrease dfc ) .",
    "this decision depends on three factors : ( 1 ) the adaptive utility of criticality  when does it make sense to sit near the critical point ? , ( 2 ) the true state of the environment , and ( 3 ) the perceived state of the environment  the accuracy with which system components can detect and encode the environmental state .",
    "the consequences of being near or at the critical point is that information can propagate quickly , with small changes to component behavior inducing large - scale changes in both structure and function .",
    "hence criticality allows the system to more easily reconfigure .",
    "how does this work ? moving towards criticality changes the distribution of fight sizes such that there are more large fights .",
    "reconfiguration becomes more likely with large fights because large fights cost more@xcite and costly conflict can lead to changes in alliances , coalitions and the power structure , which controls the cost of conflict management@xcite .",
    "we predict that reconfiguration is adaptive when the environment , after having been stable for some time , becomes uncertain .",
    "hence when the state of the environment is stable or very slowly changing and represented by a delta function , the optimal choice ( we propose ) is to increase dfc .",
    "when the environment is uncertain  that is , when it is not clear what the distribution of environmental states is , the system should decrease dfc .    for tuning to be adaptive , the state of the environment must also be correctly perceived by the tuning agent(s ) . to make this clear ,",
    "consider the following : a flock of birds in search of food with high and low sensitivity individuals .",
    "some individuals in the flock have poor eyesight and so misjudge the location of food and others have good eyesight . if the high sensitivity birds are also those with poor eyesight , the system may be inappropriately driven away from food sources .",
    "if on the other hand the good eyesight birds are also highly sensitive , the system will be appropriately driven towards food . in a similar way",
    ", tuning dfc will require accurate perception of the most beneficial change .",
    "_ hence in order for dfc to be tunable and for that tuning to be adaptive in a biological system these two types of heterogeneity must be aligned : high sensitivity score individuals must also be good detectors of environmental state_. neither of these types of heterogeneity has received much attention in the collective behavior , criticality , or biological phase transition literatures .",
    "consequently little is known about how common it is for these types of heterogeneity to be aligned or whether there are in some systems mechanisms to bring them into alignment .    in our model system ,",
    "both types of heterogeneity appear to be aligned .",
    "results of earlier work@xcite , suggest the individuals with the highest sensitivity scores also are those whose  health state \" signals the state of the larger social environment . the idea is as follows : the `` health state '' of individuals ( healthy or compromised ) builds up over a history of affiliative and agonistic social interactions with other group members and hence is a slow variable@xcite .",
    "the health state of the high sensitivity individuals serves as a proxy for system state because these individuals are among the weakest in the system ( lowest 10 percent of the power distribution ) and hence register stressful periods more visibly than the other group members @xcite .",
    "when these animals are healthy , the system can be said to be in a stable , low variance period .",
    "when these individuals are stressed above some baseline level , social dynamics are becoming uncertain . in either case ,",
    "when aggression during a fight `` reaches them '' , they move the system closer to the critical point _ because of their position in the aggression network as represented by the spin glass and branching process models_. aggression is less likely to reach them when the policing mechanism is functional and more likely to reach them when the policing mechanism has been disabled @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ ellstarfigure ] , the magenta and blue lines demonstrate the potential heterogeneity of responses when different individuals are forced .",
    "the magenta lines demonstrate the effect of forcing individuals in an order that maximizes the resulting average fight size at each step , and blue in an order that minimizes it .",
    "the individuals are re - sorted each time another is forced as this can affect the order ( for instance , forcing one individual in a strongly - correlated clique can decrease the effect of forcing other individuals in that clique ) . in fig .",
