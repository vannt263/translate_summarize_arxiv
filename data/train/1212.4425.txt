    "the study of stellar magnetic activity cycles dates back to the 1960 s , when olin wilson began monitoring ca  ii h and k ( ca  hk ) emission for a sample of stars from the mount wilson observatory ( mwo ) to provide some context for our understanding of the 11  year sunspot cycle @xcite .",
    "the mount wilson survey continued for several decades ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and ultimately documented activity cycles and rotation periods for dozens of stars @xcite .",
    "these observations revealed two distinct relationships between the activity cycle period and the rotation period , with an active `` a '' sequence including stars rotating more than 300 times for each activity cycle , and an inactive `` i '' sequence with stars rotating fewer than 100 times per activity cycle .",
    "this pattern led @xcite to suggest that there may be two different dynamos operating inside the stars , with the active sequence representing a dynamo driven by rotational shear in the near - surface layers , and the inactive sequence driven by a so - called _ tachocline _ at the base of the outer convection zone .",
    "some stars in the mount wilson sample exhibit two distinct cycle periods , suggesting that the two dynamos can operate simultaneously .",
    "the k2v star @xmath0  eridani ( @xmath0  eri @xmath3 hd  22049 , v=3.7 , b@xmath4v=0.88 ) is a young solar analog with a stellar activity record that stretches back to 1968 .",
    "the first 24 years of observations were published in @xcite , who determined a rotation period of 11.1  days and found evidence of a 5  year activity cycle .",
    "this cycle period was confirmed by @xcite from a joint analysis of the mg  ii h and k lines in archival iue spectra and more recent ca  hk observations from the complejo astronmico el leoncito ( casleo ) in argentina .",
    "additional ca  hk data were obtained by @xcite with the solar - stellar spectrograph at lowell observatory , though with less regularity because the star is slightly cooler than the close solar analogs that dominate their sample . as a bright nearby star ( @xmath5  pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath0  eri also has a precisely measured radius from interferometry ( @xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "a further constraint for stellar dynamo modeling comes from a measurement of surface differential rotation , derived from 35  days of photometry by the _",
    "most _ satellite @xcite .",
    "observations of the variable radial velocity ( rv ) of @xmath0  eri were first reported by @xcite .",
    "early claims by @xcite of periodic variations were eventually corroborated by @xcite , who identified a period near 7 years .",
    "@xcite used additional rv data to confirm the @xmath77 year period , interpreting it as the reflex motion from an eccentric jovian - mass exoplanet ; they ruled out stellar activity as the source of the variations from an analysis of mount wilson data between 1980 - 1999 .",
    "the ca  hk observations revealed periodic signals near 20 years ( the length of the data set ) and 3 years , but nothing at the orbital period of the presumed planet .",
    "the planetary nature of the companion was later confirmed by @xcite who measured the astrometric orbit using the _ hubble space telescope _ , yielding an inclination angle @xmath8 ( consistent with that of an observed dust ring ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and determining the absolute mass of the planet , @xmath9 . more recent rv measurements from the harps spectrograph imply that the properties of the planet may need to be revised , but still support a period near 7 years @xcite .",
    "we present new observations of the magnetic activity variations in @xmath0  eri from synoptic ca  hk measurements obtained since 2007 with the small and moderate aperture research telescope system ( smarts ) telescope at cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "we provide an overview of our data as well as corroborating measurements from other surveys in section  [ sec2 ] , and in section  [ sec3 ] we evaluate the dominant periodicities over time using archival observations spanning 45 years",
    ". we conclude in section  [ sec4 ] with a discussion of the implications of these results for stellar dynamo modeling and future observations .",
    "the smarts southern hk project @xcite began in august 2007 with the primary objective of characterizing magnetic activity cycles for the brightest stars ( v@xmath106 ) in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the 58 solar - type stars in the sample , defined as a subset of the @xcite sample , included all of the most likely future asteroseismic targets of the stellar observations network group ( song ; * ? ? ?",
    "several targets near the celestial equator , including @xmath0  eri , provided an overlap with the mount wilson and lowell surveys , allowing the calibration of derived ca  hk onto the mount wilson system .",
    "since august 2007 , we have used the _ rc spec _ instrument on the smarts telescope to obtain 141 low - resolution spectra ( @xmath11 ) of @xmath0  eri on 69 distinct epochs .",
    "standard iraf routines were used on the 60s integrations to apply bias and flat field corrections , and a wavelength calibration was applied using a reference spectrum obtained just prior to each pair of stellar exposures . following @xcite , we integrated the calibrated spectra in 1.09    triangular bandpasses centered on the cores of the ca h ( 396.8  nm ) and k ( 393.4  nm ) lines and compared them to 20    continuum regions from the wings of the lines to generate a ctio chromospheric activity index , @xmath12 .",
    "we used data for 26 targets that were observed contemporaneously with the solar - stellar spectrograph at lowell observatory to make the conversion to mount wilson indices ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "our smarts observations of @xmath0  eri are listed in table  [ tab1 ] , where the quoted uncertainties represent the internal errors and do not include the systematic uncertainty ( @xmath14 ) from the conversion between the ctio and mwo indices .",
    "we used additional observations of @xmath0  eri from previously published surveys to corroborate our recent smarts measurements and to extend the time baseline of our analysis .",
    "the mwo data from 19681992 were published by @xcite . although observations were collected at mount wilson for nearly an additional decade beyond 1992 ,",
    "those data have never been released .",
    "fortunately , the data from lowell observatory begin in 1994 and continue to the present ( see * ? ? ? * ) . as the lowell series is the longest among the recent measurements , we used these observations to rescale the other data to the mwo system .",
    "the southern survey at casleo includes measurements of @xmath0  eri from 20012011 @xcite .",
    "additional published data between 20022010 are available from the california planet search ( cps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and between 20042008 from the harps spectrograph @xcite . in each case",
    "we placed the measurements on the mount wilson system from their overlap with the lowell data , yielding multiplicative scale factors of 1.04 ( casleo ) , 1.09 ( cps ) , and 1.32 ( harps ) .",
    "the results presented in section  [ sec3 ] are insensitive to small changes in these factors . from the combined data we calculated seasonal means for each year that had more than three observations , including uncertainties that reflect the standard deviation within each season .",
    "the observed scatter is dominated by actual variations in the caused by rotational modulation of individual active regions , but it also contains a small contribution from the statistical uncertainties of the individual measurements ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] ) .    the chromospheric activity measurements of @xmath0  eri are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the top panel includes the recent measurements from smarts ( @xmath15 , see table  [ tab1 ] ) , as well as the data from lowell ( @xmath16 ) , casleo ( @xmath17 ) , cps ( @xmath18 ) , and harps ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the bottom panel includes all of the recent data as well as the archival measurements from mount wilson ( grey points ) along with our calculated seasonal means and those from @xcite .",
    "we determined the significant periodicities in our chromospheric activity measurements by passing both the seasonal and nightly mean through a lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite . in each case",
    ", we also performed the analysis on two subsets of the data , between 19681992 from mwo and on the more recent measurements between 19942012 , to understand the dominant source of various periodicities .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , where the top and bottom panels show the periodogram of the seasonal and nightly means , respectively .",
    "the early data from mwo ( dotted lines ) reveals a primary periodicity near 13 years and smaller peaks near 3  years and 5  years .",
    "the 13  year period appears to be rooted in the broad activity minimum between 19851992 in the mwo data , but it is also evident in the declining activity level of successive minima since 2006 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the more recent data ( dashed lines ) are dominated by a period near 3 years , but they also show a weak signal near 7  years which corresponds to the orbital period of the exoplanet .",
    "this 7  year period is present in the individual observations of the longer time series measurements from both lowell and cps , while the 3  year signal is present in each of the recent data sets individually .",
    "the longest time series from lowell resolves the power between 35 years into multiple components , among which the 3  year signal is the strongest .",
    "this is also reflected in the periodogram of the full data set ( solid lines ) , which shows significant periodicities at @xmath1 years and @xmath2 years ( both with false alarm probability @xmath20 from the nightly means ) along with several weaker peaks between 37 years .",
    "simulations of the two dominant periods reveal all of these peaks to be artifacts of the time sampling .",
    "an additional peak at longer periods of 2035 years is present in both periodograms , but we exclude it from our analysis because it is correlated with the length of the adopted data set .    , width=316 ]    to investigate the strength of these periodic signals over time , we performed a wavelet analysis of the seasonal mean measurements @xcite .",
    "such an analysis essentially calculates a periodogram for overlapping subsets of the time series , where the length of the subset must be proportional to the periodicity under investigation .",
    "consequently , there are regions of the wavelet spectrum ( outside of the so - called `` cone of influence '' ) that suffer from edge effects , where the signal is attenuated .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , where the border of the cone of influence is indicated with a hatched region and the significance of the signal is shown with a color scale going from the weakest ( white and blue ) to the strongest ( black and red ) .",
    "the 2.95  year and 12.7  year periods are indicated with dashed horizontal lines .",
    "the 2.95  year period maintains its strength through most of the duration of the time series , with the exception of the late 1980 s to early 1990 s through the broad activity minimum . during this interval ,",
    "the signal is dominated by the 12.7  year periodicity , which remains strong inside the cone of influence .",
    "the spurious 5  year signal in the mwo data appears only in the early observations , while the 7  year artifact in the recent data is also transient and even less prominent .",
    "due to the limited time - resolution of the wavelet analysis for longer periods , it is difficult to determine whether the 2.95  year and 12.7  year periods coexist simultaneously , or if they alternate instead . if the 2.95  year period actually disappeared during the broad activity minimum , it may represent the first observation of another star entering ( and later emerging from ) a maunder minimum - like state for the short cycle .",
    ", width=316 ]    it is striking that @xmath0  eri displays such short magnetic activity cycles .",
    "many models of the solar dynamo favor a flux - transport paradigm , and typically the slow meridional circulations set the cycle timescale for a dynamo operating in the tachocline at the base of the outer convection zone ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . from three - dimensional ( 3-d ) models of stellar convection , we expect that the meridional circulations should be weaker in lower mass stars and at faster rotation rates @xcite . in babcock - leighton flux - transport models",
    ", this should lead to long activity cycles @xcite . to test this assertion",
    ", we used the mesa code @xcite to generate a stellar structure model for @xmath0  eri assuming a mass of 0.85  @xmath21 and an age of 0.8  gyr .",
    "the radius , luminosity and @xmath22 of this model agree with the interferometric observations @xcite , and the convective velocities @xmath23 are roughly half as fast as in the solar convection zone . from angular momentum transport arguments ( @xmath24 )",
    ", this suggests that the meridional flow speed @xmath25 might be as small as 10% of the solar value ( or about 23 ms@xmath26 at the photosphere ) , making @xmath0  eri a challenging case for flux - transport dynamos .",
    "recently , 3-d simulations of convectively driven dynamos in rapidly rotating stars have achieved large - scale organization and cyclic behavior in stellar convection zones @xcite .",
    "these dynamos do not rely on the slow meridional circulations , and can exhibit short cycles even in rapidly rotating lower mass stars , with the cycle period determined by the rotation rate and the convective properties @xcite .",
    "of relevance to @xmath0  eri , these convection zone dynamos show both short - period and long - period variations in the global - scale magnetism .",
    "the long - term behavior of the magnetic activity cycles observed in @xmath0  eri qualitatively resembles the interaction of the 11  year solar cycle with the quasi - biennial ( @xmath72  year ) variations analyzed by @xcite  ( @xcite , their fig .  1 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the shorter ( 2.95  year ) cycle in @xmath0  eri appears to be modulated by the longer ( 12.7  year ) cycle . during the broad minimum of the long cycle in 19851992",
    ", there is no evidence of the short - period variations .",
    "@xcite  documented similar behavior in the sun from helioseismic observations , with the quasi - biennial variations almost disappearing during the minimum of the 11  year solar cycle but gradually returning during the rise to solar maximum .",
    "they attributed this behavior to buoyant magnetic flux , generated near the tachocline during periods of high activity in the 11  year cycle , rising through the outer convection zone and episodically pumping up the amplitude of the quasi - biennial cycle .",
    "support for this interpretation has emerged recently from efforts to localize the source of the quasi - biennial variations , placing them firmly in the near - surface regions of the sun @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the 2.95  year/12.7  year cycles in @xmath0  eri are analogous to the 2  year/11  year cycles in the sun , then the localization of the two signals has interesting consequences for the identification of the dynamos that are responsible for the active and inactive sequences as proposed by @xcite .",
    "she suggested that `` differential rotation near the surface mainly feeds [ the a - sequence ] dynamos '' , while `` interface dynamos in the stars with deep [ outer convection zones ] are the important ones for the i - sequence stars '' .",
    "this is precisely the opposite identification as that suggested by the helioseismic observations , which support a short cycle on the i - sequence localized in the near - surface regions and a long cycle on the a - sequence attributed to an interface dynamo at the tachocline . on the other hand",
    ", the sun appears to be an outlier when compared to the a and i sequences established by observations of other stars . with the solar - like magnetic cycles observed in @xmath0  eri , we are now in a better position to evaluate the specific property of the sun that might make it peculiar in the context of other stars . despite the fact that the sun rotates less than half as fast as @xmath0  eri , the stars each appear to have two interacting dynamos that operate on very similar timescales .",
    "this leads us to speculate that the rotational history of the sun may be what makes it an outlier in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "a complementary indication of the rotational history of a star can be found in its li abundance .",
    "a stronger than usual rotational shear at the base of the outer convection zone can induce additional mixing below the tachocline where the temperature is sufficient to destroy li .",
    "the solar li abundance is anomalously low compared to some well - characterized solar twins such as 18  sco @xcite , suggesting that the sun may have been subjected to some additional mixing during its evolution .",
    "one way to explain a non - standard rotational history for the sun is to blame jupiter .",
    "@xcite suggested that a necessary condition for the formation of jovian - mass planets is a long - lived proto - planetary disk , which then has sufficient time to interact with the stellar convection zone and induce a strong rotational shear between the radiative zone and the surface layers .",
    "this model predicts enhanced li depletion among stars like the sun and @xmath0  eri which have jovian - mass planets , compared to stars like 18  sco which do not .",
    "the li abundance of @xmath0  eri ( @xmath27(li)=@xmath28 ) is a factor of five below the solar value ( @xmath29(li)=@xmath30 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it falls on the upper end of the distribution for stars with similar @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "thus , if a jovian - mass companion is responsible for the relatively low solar li abundance , the underlying mechanism must not be effective in all cases",
    ".    additional constraints on the interior structure and dynamics of @xmath0  eri could come from future asteroseismic observations by the song network @xcite . even without a dedicated network of telescopes ,",
    "ground - based rv observations have already revealed solar - like oscillations in @xmath31  cen  b @xcite , which is only slightly more luminous than @xmath0  eri .",
    "if solar - like oscillation amplitudes scale like @xmath32^s$ ] @xcite , then the signal in @xmath0  eri should be between 64% ( s=1.5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and 81% ( s=0.7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as strong as that seen in @xmath31  cen  b. assuming comparable mode lifetimes for the two stars and using a more recent scaling relation that includes a dependence on @xmath22 @xcite , the estimate rises to 85% .",
    "however , the relatively strong magnetic activity of @xmath0  eri may suppress the oscillation amplitudes @xcite .",
    "nearly uninterrupted rv measurements from song that span several months are expected to have the precision necessary to measure the depth of the surface convection zone @xcite and to reveal possible signatures of strong radial differential rotation @xcite . when combined with constraints on surface differential rotation from _ most _ @xcite and our detailed characterization of the interacting magnetic cycles , @xmath0  eri may represent the best opportunity beyond the sun to test stellar dynamo theory .",

    "<S> the active k2 dwarf @xmath0  eri has been extensively characterized , both as a young solar analog and more recently as an exoplanet host star . </S>",
    "<S> as one of the nearest and brightest stars in the sky , it provides an unparalleled opportunity to constrain stellar dynamo theory beyond the sun . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm and document the 3  year magnetic activity cycle in @xmath0  eri originally reported by hatzes and coworkers , and we examine the archival data from previous observations spanning 45 years . </S>",
    "<S> the data show coexisting 3  year and 13  year periods leading into a broad activity minimum that resembles a maunder minimum - like state , followed by the resurgence of a coherent 3  year cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the nearly continuous activity record suggests the simultaneous operation of two stellar dynamos with cycle periods of @xmath1 years and @xmath2 years , which by analogy with the solar case suggests a revised identification of the dynamo mechanisms that are responsible for the so - called `` active '' and `` inactive '' sequences as proposed by bhm - vitense . </S>",
    "<S> finally , based on the observed properties of @xmath0  eri we argue that the rotational history of the sun is what makes it an outlier in the context of magnetic cycles observed in other stars ( as also suggested by its li depletion ) , and that a jovian - mass companion can not be the universal explanation for the solar peculiarities . </S>"
