    "stochastic resonance is a phenomenon concerned about amplifying a small signal forcing a nonlinear system by addition of a stochastic noise to the signal @xcite .",
    "it may represent an example against common wisdom where the noise becomes fruitful for information transmission .",
    "when considering aperiodical signals for a channel performance , the peak of mutual information between the input signal and output signal is used as the definition of resonance @xcite .",
    "stochastic resonance has been already studied for some quantum systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , due to the increasing attention dedicated to information transmission through quantum channels @xcite , it becomes interesting to see whether such effect also exits there .",
    "the possibility was put forward in ref.@xcite without however reaching any evidence , whilst ref.@xcite showed a small enhancement of the classical information transmission rate by the addition of noise in presence of threshold detection .    here",
    "we clearly show stochastic resonance effects in quantum channels . to this end",
    "we shall provide examples where the addition of noise is able to enhance the rate of information transmission .",
    "this may happen for both quantum and classical uses of the channels .",
    "a quantum channel is any completely positive and trace preserving ( cptp ) map from a set of input density operators @xmath0 to a output one @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it can be described by a quantum operation @xmath2 transforming @xmath3 one can represents the map @xmath2 through a unitary transformation on a larger quantum system that includes the environment @xmath4 of the system , @xmath5 .",
    "\\label{urep}\\ ] ] where the environment has been considered initially in a pure state @xmath6 without loss of generality , and the trace @xmath7 is taken over environmental degree of freedom .",
    "alternatively , one can represents the map @xmath2 through the kraus decomposition @xmath8 where the operators @xmath9 satisfy the completeness relation @xmath10 .    for a classical use of the channel the transmission rate",
    "is determined by the holevo-@xmath11 quantity @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a covex decomposition of @xmath14 over the states @xmath15 encoding the classical alphabet symbols .",
    "@xmath16 denotes the von neumann entropy .",
    "the input - output mutual information reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 with @xmath19 measures the amount of information exchanged between the system @xmath0 and the environment @xmath4 during their interaction @xcite .",
    "this can be used to characterize the amount of quantum noise in the channel .",
    "if the environment is initially in a pure state , the entropy exchange is just the environment s entropy after the interaction .    for a quantum use of the channel the transmission rate",
    "is determined by the coherent information @xcite @xmath20 which plays a role in quantum information theory analogous to that played by the mutual information in classical information theory .",
    "it can be positive , negative , or zero .",
    "let us consider a modified amplitude damping channel as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the identity matrix and @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the usual pauli operators .",
    "this channel has a simple interpretation : when @xmath26 it behaves like an amplitude damping channel ; when @xmath27 it also introduces a phase flip , and for @xmath28 it becomes a phase flip channel @xcite .",
    "there are already some indications that these two kind of noise can compete each other @xcite , thus improving the performance of the channel .    a general ( input )",
    "state in the bloch sphere representation can be written as @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the bloch vector of length unity or less , and @xmath31 is the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "the length @xmath32 of the vector @xmath33 describes the purity of the input state .",
    "the action of the channel on this state is : @xmath34 in which @xmath35 the matrix @xmath36 of eq.([w ] ) thus computed reads @xmath37 the noise strength becomes @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the eigenvalues of the @xmath36 matrix .",
    "furthermore , the eigenvalues of @xmath40 result @xmath41 then @xmath42",
    ".    the noise enhancement can be investigated by looking for some initial states , @xmath43 , and damping rate , @xmath44 , where the slope of @xmath45 . however , in practice it is difficult to calculate such function analytically and obtain useful results .",

    "[ fig1]c ) referes to a mixing of the two channels and one can clearly see an enhancement of coherent information for increasing noise ( e.g. for @xmath46 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the stochastic resonance effect manifests only for high enough purity of the input states .",
    "= 6.5 cm 0.2 cm = 6.5 cm 0.2 cm = 6.5 cm 0.3 cm",
    "let us now consider a modified bit flip channel as follows : @xmath47 also this channel has a simple interpretation : when @xmath26 it behaves like a bit flip channel ; when @xmath27 it also introduces a phase flip , and for @xmath28 it becomes a phase flip channel .",
    "the action of the channel on the input state ( [ input ] ) is : @xmath34 in which @xmath48 the matrix @xmath36 of eq.([w ] ) thus computed reads @xmath49 then , by repeating the steps of the previous section we can look for the desired effect .",
    "some examples are given in fig .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) , fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) refer respectively to the limit cases of bit flip and phase filip channel where the concavity of the coherent information is exactly opposite to that of the noise . instead , fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) referes to a mixing of the two channels and one can clearly see an enhancement of coherent information for increasing noise ( e.g. for @xmath50 ) .",
    "also in this example the stochastic resonance effect manifests only for high enough purity of the input states .",
    "= 6.5 cm 0.2 cm = 6.5 cm 0.2 cm = 6.5 cm 0.3 cm",
    "let us finally consider a modified dense coding protocol with the addition of some noise in the noiseless channel used by alice to send her qubit to bob .",
    "let @xmath51 be the state shared a priori by alice and bob , we consider as input state @xmath52 , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 like in the standard dense coding protocol @xcite .",
    "then the transmission rate , according to eq.([chi ] ) , results @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the local map describing the noise according to eq.([cptp ] ) .",
    "suppose now that @xmath51 is a werner - like mixture @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is one of the bell states and @xmath63 the degree of mixedness .",
    "in such a case @xmath64 hence @xmath65 .",
    "consider the noise @xmath60 specifically described by operators @xmath66 on alice s qubit . by comparison with eqs.([ad1])-([ad2 ] ) the above equations represent an amplitude damping channel .",
    "then , simple calculations give @xmath67 whose eigenvalues are @xmath68\\,,\\\\ \\xi_{3,4}&=&\\frac{1}{4}\\left[2\\mp\\sqrt{p^2 + 4(1-p)(1-q)^3}-p(1-q)-q\\right]\\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus @xmath69 .",
    "the matrix @xmath36 results @xmath70 hence , @xmath71 .",
    "some examples of the rate - noise relation are plotted in fig .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) refers to the limit case of pure @xmath51 state giving the concavity of @xmath11 exactly opposite to that of the noise . instead , in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) one can clearly see an enhancement of @xmath11 for increasing noise ( e.g. for @xmath72 ) .",
    "this becomes true for all values of @xmath44 as soon as the state @xmath51 becomes completely mixed .",
    "notice , however that the stochastic resonance effect does not allow the rate to exceed one .",
    "= 6.5 cm 0.2 cm = 6.5 cm 0.2 cm = 6.5 cm 0.3 cm",
    "in conclusion , we have shown the possibility of stochastic resonance effects in quantum channels explicitly providing examples where the information transmission rate increases by increasing the noise in the channel .",
    "the first two examples share some analogies with memory effects in quantum channels @xcite because the stochastic resonance comes out when one error takes place ( e.g. bit flip ) and another correlated does ( e.g. phase flip ) .",
    "this leads to enhancement of coherent information @xcite .",
