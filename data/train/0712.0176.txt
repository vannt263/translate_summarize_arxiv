    "this star is a known @xmath0scuti star with a variability period of 3.6h , discovered by the hipparcos mission .",
    "koen et al .  ( 2001 ) reported the spectral type as f2  iii sreusi , making it the most evolved ap star known .",
    "our uves observations covered @xmath2 of the known @xmath0scuti pulsation period , showing broad spectral lines ( @xmath3kms@xmath4 ) with small variable peaks in the line profiles ( top of fig .  1 ) .",
    "in the bottom of fig .  1 we present all observed spectra stacked in two - dimensional images for the same two spectral regions .",
    "it is clearly visible that three peaks are moving evenly towards the red with a speed of 21kms@xmath4 per hour .",
    "however , no spectral features moving at higher frequencies were found in our spectra . to measure the radial velocities of these peaks we filtered lower spectral frequencies and used the cross - correlation method .",
    "similar splitting in line profiles has recently been detected by yushchenko et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in two other @xmath0 scuti stars , @xmath0scuti itself and hd57749 .",
    "the spectral type in the catalogue of renson et al .",
    "( 1991 ) is given as a3sr and from strmgren photometry we obtained @xmath5k ( hubrig et al .",
    "this ap star is located in the same region of parameter space in which rapid pulsations have been detected , but an earlier search for pulsations in the cape survey yielded no detection ( martinez & kurtz 1994 ) .",
    "we obtained for this star 15 high time resolution uves spectra . from these spectra",
    "we estimated @xmath6kms@xmath4 using the first zero of the fourier transform of the spectral line profile of the magnetically insensitive lines .",
    "our analysis of radial velocity variations of ndiii lines revealed a pulsation period of 5.1min .",
    "however , there is a potential ambiguity for the pulsation period indicating that also a 14.2min period is possible .",
    "longer time series with higher temporal resolution are needed for a more detailed analysis of the pulsational frequencies . from fitting the radial velocity variations of the ndiii line at @xmath76327 with a sinusoidal curve we obtained a semi - amplitude of 0.51kms@xmath4 ."
