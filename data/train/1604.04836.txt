    "the mv2 model has also been extensively studied in complex networks , including random graphs @xcite , small world networks @xcite , scale - free networks @xcite , and some others @xcite . these studies have shown that mv2 models defined on different complex networks belong to different universality classes and the critical exponents depend on the topology of the network topologies . the generalization to a three - state majority - vote model ( mv3 ) on a regular lattice was considered by @xcite , where the authors found the critical exponents for this non - equilibrium mv3 model are in agreement with the ones for the equilibrium three - states potts model @xcite , supporting again the conjecture of @xcite . recently ,",

    "_ studied the mv3 model on random graphs and they found that the critical noise is a function of the mean connectivity of the graph @xcite . in @xcite , lima introduced a new zero - state to mv2 model in square lattices and found that this model also falls into the ising universality .",

    "we generalize the mv model to arbitrary multiple states where each agent is allowed to be in one of @xmath0 different states with @xmath0 being an integer no less than two . in each step , an agent is randomly chosen and assumes that its state aligns with the state of the majority of its neighborhood with probability @xmath1 and with the minority state with probability @xmath2 . herein , the number of neighboring spins of any agent is fixed that randomly selected from all the other agents at each step .",
    "we mainly focus on the difference in the nature of the order - disorder phase transition between the mv2 model and the mv3 model .",
