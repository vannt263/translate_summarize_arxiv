    "experiments being performed at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( tjnaf ) are designed to test our understanding of deuteron properties at space - like momentum transfers comparable to the nucleon mass . in building theoretical models of these processes , relativistic kinematics and dynamics would seem to be called for .",
    "hence , considerable theoretical effort has been invested in constructing relativistic formalisms for the two - nucleon bound state that are based on an effective quantum - field - theory lagrangian .",
    "if the usual hadronic degrees of freedom appear in the lagrangian , then this strategy can be used to obtain a logical extension of the standard non - relativistic treatment of the two - nucleon system .",
    "the central goal of such an approach is to capture the relativistic effects in the two - nucleon system . at the same time , for applications to electromagnetic physics , it is critical to embed the ward - takahashi identities that imply current conservation for electromagnetic interactions in the theory .",
    "this paper focuses on a three - dimensional ( 3d ) formalism that , in principle , is equivalent to the four - dimensional ( 4d ) bethe - salpeter formalism .",
    "this approach has been developed in two recent papers  @xcite .",
    "we review the formalism for relativistic bound states , and provide an extension that ensures nonsingular behavior of the interaction in frames where the total momentum of the bound system is nonzero .",
    "we also construct the corresponding electromagnetic current .",
    "calculations of elastic electron - deuteron scattering are performed based upon the impulse approximation and the results for the observables @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are presented .    the bethe - salpeter equation , @xmath4 for the four - dimensional @xmath0 amplitude @xmath5 provides a theoretical description of the deuteron that includes relativity . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bse ] ) , @xmath6 is the bethe - salpeter kernel , and @xmath7 is the free two - nucleon propagator . in a strict quantum - field - theory treatment ,",
    "the kernel @xmath6 includes the infinite set of two - particle irreducible @xmath8 feynman graphs . numerical methods to calculate the 4d t - matrix of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bse ] ) , with an infinite kernel containing all crossed ladders , have been developed and demonstrated for a simple scalar field theory by nieuwenhuis and tjon  @xcite .",
    "for the two - nucleon system , such an application of the full effective quantum field theory of nucleons and mesons is not only impractical , it also is inappropriate because hadronic degrees of freedom are not fundamental .",
    "rather , the bethe - salpeter formalism serves as a theoretical framework within which a relativistic effective interaction may be developed .",
    "this is entirely analogous to the way that the schrdinger equation serves as a framework for development of a non - relativistic potential that describes the @xmath0 phase shifts .",
    "since the @xmath0 interaction is an effective one , it is equally appropriate to develop the relativistic effective interaction within an equivalent three - dimensional formalism that is obtained from the four - dimensional bethe - salpeter formalism via a systematic reduction technique .    in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a 3d reduction of the bethe - salpeter formalism was developed such that the resulting equations involve the same propagator as appears in the salpeter equation  @xcite , @xmath9 the three - dimensional propagator @xmath10 is obtained by integrating over the time - component of relative momentum , @xmath11 the 3d kernel is defined by solving two coupled equations , @xmath12 which is three - dimensional , and @xmath13 which is four dimensional .",
    "in fact , the condition ( [ eq : k1 ] ) is obtained by demanding that @xmath14 .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "other works which have considered a similar formalism include refs .  @xcite . )",
    "this formalism is systematic in the sense that , given a perturbative expansion for the 4d kernel , @xmath6 , a perturbative expansion for the 3d kernel , @xmath15 , can be developed .",
    "however , it is necessary for @xmath10 to be invertible in order for the 3d reduction to contain the full content of the 4d theory .    as mentioned above , when @xmath7 is the standard two - particle propagator of the bethe - salpeter formalism , @xmath10 is the 3d salpeter propagator . for spin-1/2 particles it is , @xmath16 where @xmath17 are related to projection operators onto positive and negative - energy states of the dirac equation , @xmath18 is the total energy of the two - body system , and @xmath19 here , and throughout the paper , these single - particle energies are to be understood as having an infinitesimal negative imaginary part .",
    "this defines our @xmath20 prescriptions .",
    "note that for spin - half particles , the equal - time propagator of the salpeter equation is defined only on two of the four sectors of the dirac space of two particles .",
    "it is not invertible .",
    "although consistent equations can be projected out for the @xmath21 and @xmath22 components , one must set the @xmath23 and @xmath24 components to zero for consistency .",
    "consequently , the 3d reduction does not have the full content of the 4d theory .",
    "if the 4d and 3d theories are to have the same dynamical content then we must include graphs involving @xmath23 states , such as the the time - ordered z - graph of fig .",
    "[ fig - zgraph ] , in both .",
    "this graph is not contained in the ladder bethe - salpeter equation scattering series .",
    "the absence of this mechanism from the ladder bethe - salpeter equation is related to the fact that if we allow one particle s mass to tend to infinity , the propagator does not reduce to the dirac propagator for the other particle . consequently , eq .  ( [ eq : salpeter ] )",
    "does not possess the correct one - body limit if any finite set of graphs is chosen for @xmath15 .",
    "if a scattering equation with a kernel which contains only a finite number of graphs is to possess the correct one - body limit , two distinct criteria must be satisfied .",
    "first the 3d propagator should limit to the one - body propagator for one particle ( either dirac or klein - gordon , depending upon the spin ) as the other particle s mass tends to infinity .",
    "second , as either particle s mass tends to infinity , the equation should become equivalent to one in which the interaction , @xmath15 , is static .",
    "in fact , eq .  ( [ eq : salpeter ] ) s lack of either of these properties springs directly from the bethe - salpeter equation ( [ eq : bse ] ) not having the correct one - body limit if the kernel does not include the infinite set of crossed - ladder graphs . as alluded to above , solution of the bethe - salpeter equation with such a kernel is impractical in the @xmath0 system .",
    "nevertheless , the desired properties may be obtained by using a 4d integral equation for @xmath6 to reorganize the contributions to the kernel of the bethe - salpeter equation as follows , @xmath25 given a suitable choice for @xmath26 , this equation defines a reduced kernel , @xmath27 , in terms of the original kernel , @xmath6 .",
    "the propagator , @xmath26 , is chosen so as to separate the parts of the kernel , @xmath6 , that are necessary to obtain the one - body limits from the parts that are not .",
    "once this is done , @xmath27 may be truncated at any desired order without losing the one - body limits .",
    "it is readily seen that the original kernel @xmath6 may be eliminated in favor of the reduced one , @xmath27 , so as to obtain the following 4d equation for the t - matrix , which is equivalent to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bse ] ) and ( [ eq : u-4d ] ) , @xmath28 where @xmath29 we are now in a position to remedy the defects of our previous three - dimensional reduction . applying the same 3d reduction procedure as above to this new 4d equation produces @xmath30 where the 3d propagator is @xmath31 and @xmath32 is a parameter that arises from the eikonal approximation .",
    "this 3d propagator is found by integrating the four - dimensional propagator over the time component of relative momentum . in configuration space",
    "this action is equivalent to considering the propagator in which the two particles involved are considered only on equal time slices .",
    "thus this will be referred to as the et propagator .",
    "it was derived for use with instant interactions by mandelzweig and wallace  @xcite with the choice @xmath33 .",
    "it has the correct one - body limits as either particle s mass tends to infinity and has an invertible form .",
    "meanwhile , the 3d kernel @xmath34 is systematically defined by two equations that are obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : k1 ] ) and ( [ eq : calg - g0 ] ) by the substitutions @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    equation ( [ eq:3det ] ) is a 3d scattering equation that incorporates relativistic effects systematically and has the correct one - body limit .",
    "numerical calculations by nieuwenhuis and tjon  @xcite , and in our previous paper  @xcite , suggest that the three - dimensional equation with a lowest - order kernel provides a good approximation to the relevant physics of the full scattering series of ladders and crossed ladders .",
    "negative - energy states and thus z - graphs , such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - zgraph ] , are included in the 3d formalism in a way that is symmetrical with respect to interchange of particle labels .",
    "when the terms in the propagator involving @xmath38 are omitted , it takes a form that is very similar to the 3d propagator of the spectator formalism of gross  @xcite , as derived with particle 1 on mass shell .",
    "correspondingly , when the terms in the propagator involving @xmath39 are omitted , the propagator is very similar to that of the spectator formalism , derived with particle 2 on mass shell . indeed , in @xmath21 sectors , eq .",
    "( [ eq : aveg0gc ] ) is the same as either of these spectator propagators , and thus differences arise only because of the negative - energy states .",
    "usually for the @xmath0 system , a symmetrized form of the spectator propagator is used , and this is obtained by averaging the propagators derived with particle 1 and particle 2 on mass shell  @xcite . however , because of averaging , the symmetrized spectator propagator has half the propagation amplitudes of the et propagator in @xmath23 and @xmath24 states .",
    "a similar comparison may be made with the bslt quasipotential propagator of blankenbecler - sugar  @xcite and logunov - tavkhelidze  @xcite that has been used in the work of hummel and tjon  @xcite .",
    "the bslt propagator also has half the propagation amplitudes of the et propagator in @xmath23 and @xmath24 states . because similar couplings to the @xmath23 and @xmath24 states are present in all of these approaches when similar meson exchange interactions are used , we would expect the role of negative - energy states to be larger when the et propagator is used that when either the spectator propagator of gross or the bslt propagator of hummel and tjon is used .",
    "a straightforward analysis of time - ordered perturbation theory graphs for the @xmath0 t - matrix in the static limit ( see appendix  [ ap - zgraphtopt ] ) shows that the leading z - graphs involving the intermediate @xmath23 and @xmath24 states are correctly given by the et propagator .",
    "results based upon either the symmetrized gross propagator or the bslt propagator are too small by a factor of two .",
    "our preference for the et formalism is based on three facts : it embeds the correct one - body limit for _ either _ particle as the mass of the other particle tends to infinity ; it provides the correct isoscalar z - graph contributions to leading order in @xmath40 for the @xmath0 system ; and the systematic 3d formalism associated with it includes retardation effects without possessing the unphysical singularities that generally are present in quasipotential theories .    for relativistic bound states ,",
    "the 4d vertex functions at total momentum @xmath41 obey @xmath42 equivalently , one may use the 3d vertex function that is obtained with the use of the et propagator , @xmath43 shortly , we shall need the relations of 4d vertex functions to the 3d ones , which is as follows , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is defined by , @xmath46 { \\cal g}_0(p ) \\omega^r ( p ) .",

    "\\label{eq : omegal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the spirit underlying the use of an effective @xmath0 interaction , the 3d interaction @xmath34 is truncated at `` lowest order '' within a systematic expansion in powers of the coupling constant .",
    "this truncation violates lorentz invariance , although the full 3d reduction formalism is equivalent to the 4d formalism and thus respects lorentz invariance . for electromagnetic matrix elements ,",
    "the absorption of the virtual photon s momentum @xmath48 causes the final state to have nonzero three - momentum , even if the initial state did not .",
    "thus , in general , a dynamical boost is needed to obtain wave functions in frames where the bound state has nonzero three - momentum . in our 3d formalism",
    ", the dynamical boost is embedded within the equations .",
    "wave functions corresponding to nonzero three - momentum should be obtained straightforwardly by solving the bound - state equation with the interaction appropriate to the moving frame .",
    "this differs from the interaction in the c.m .",
    "frame because retardation corrections and dirac spinors in the matrix elements depend upon the total momentum .",
    "the violation of lorentz invariance causes the total bound - state energy @xmath49 to differ from @xmath50 . for the deuteron ,",
    "the effect is small and it may be compensated by a simple renormalization of the interaction that , in effect , approximately takes into account the terms omitted when @xmath34 is truncated at lowest order .",
    "results for deuteron form factors have been found in previous calculations to be essentially the same whether the interaction is renormalized or not , thus indicating negligible sensitivity to the truncation and the associated violation of lorentz invariance .    in order to confront the predictions of this formalism with electron - scattering data",
    "we must derive a 3d reduction of the electromagnetic current that is consistent with the reduction of the scattering equation .",
    "a clear 4d formalism for the current follows from coupling photons everywhere in the bethe - salpeter green s function .",
    "this leads to the following gauge - invariant 4d result for the photon s interaction with the two - nucleon system : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 is a five - point function for insertion of a photon of momentum @xmath48 and lorentz index @xmath54 in the free propagator @xmath7 , and @xmath55 is the five - point , two - nucleon irreducible @xmath56 amplitude found by coupling the photon to all charged - particle lines inside the bethe - salpeter kernel @xmath6 .",
    "a similar result holds for the 4d theory involving @xmath26 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the result of coupling the photon to all internal lines of the reduced interaction @xmath27 . in order to develop a conserved current in the 4d theory based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : t(u)4d ] ) , we must construct @xmath60 , which is the extra current required in order that @xmath61 satisfies a ward - takahashi identity involving @xmath62 .",
    "unfortunately , this is not straightforward , since in general the variable @xmath32 in @xmath26 depends on the three - momentum of the intermediate state . as we shall see in section  [ sec - gi ] , we can not simply use the standard fermion electromagnetic current , @xmath63 , since this choice violates current conservation .",
    "in section  [ sec - gi ] we construct the additional pieces of the current that restore current conservation , thereby obtaining a conserved current @xmath64 for use with vertex functions obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma-4d ] ) .    in this paper",
    ", we develop an equivalent 3d form of the current matrix elements for the equal - time formalism , based on an expansion of the formula , @xmath65 the resultant reduction is consistent with the reduction used to obtain the 3d t - matrix of eq .",
    "( [ eq:3det ] ) and the vertex function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma1 - 3d ] ) .",
    "furthermore , this reduction preserves the two - body electromagnetic ward - takahashi identities which are present in the 4d theory .",
    "quantities inside angle brackets are integrated over time - components of relative momenta , thus reducing them to a 3d form .",
    "this yields a consistent three - dimensional formalism that includes the effects of relativity systematically , has the correct one - body limits , and maintains current conservation .",
    "we then apply this machinery to the calculation of electron - deuteron scattering in the impulse approximation .",
    "previous calculations of electron - deuteron scattering by hummel and tjon  @xcite have used instant interactions and a form of the et current . however , several approximations were employed , such as the use of wave functions based on the 3d quasipotential propagator of blankenbecler - sugar  @xcite and logunov - tavkhelidze  @xcite , approximate boost operators , and an electromagnetic current which was conserved only in positive - energy states . calculations of elastic electron - deuteron scattering also were performed by devine and wallace using an instant interaction and the et propagator of mandelzweig and wallace , eq .",
    "( [ eq : aveg0gc ] ) with the choice of @xmath32 given below that equation .",
    "@xcite in that work , a suitable conserved current was derived for use with vertex functions that included negative - energy components . in this paper",
    ", we extend these previous analyses by use of our systematic 3d formalism with the improved choice of @xmath32 that is needed when retardation effects are included .",
    "it is easy to show that if the instant approximation is used to reduce the four - dimensional equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : t(u)4d ] ) , to the three - dimensional et equation , a particularly simple three - dimensional conserved current exists .",
    "if we denote this current by @xmath66 , then we may write the resulting ward - takahashi identity as : @xmath67   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & ( 1 \\leftrightarrow 2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 indicates the part of the current proportional to charge @xmath69 , with momenta and labels of the two particles interchanged . consequently , if we construct the current matrix element @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the vertex function obtained from the bound - state equation corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma1 - 3d ] ) with an instant interaction chosen for @xmath34 , then the result will be a conserved impulse current .",
    "a similar instant analysis was performed by devine and wallace  @xcite .",
    "our instant calculations differ from those of ref .",
    "@xcite in that a slightly different choice for @xmath72 is made than was made by wallace and mandelzweig .",
    "this different choice for @xmath32 is necessitated by the requirement that the three - dimensional theory with retardations should not possess any unphysical singularities when evaluated in a frame where the two - body system has large momentum .",
    "a first step beyond the instant approximation may be obtained by replacing the vertex @xmath71 , which is calculated with instant obe interactions , with the vertex @xmath73 , calculated with the full retarded obe interaction obtained in the systematic et formalism . in order to maintain current conservation",
    "our approach demands that in making this change we should also replace @xmath74 by a significantly more complicated object , @xmath64 .",
    "the resultant current matrix element , which we denote @xmath75 , differs from eq .",
    "( [ eq : emme ] ) by replacement of the subscript inst by the subscript et in the vertex functions and replacement of @xmath66 by @xmath64 .",
    "this @xmath76 would satisfy current conservation when retardations are included provided that we also included the two - body currents , such as the one depicted in figure  [ fig - inflight ] , that become necessary because of retardation effects .",
    "this work is concerned primarily with displaying the formalism and performing impulse approximation calculations that explore the effects of retardation and negative - energy components in the vertex functions .",
    "therefore , we use the simpler current @xmath77 with the et vertex functions as well as with the instant vertex functions . for elastic electron - deuteron scattering this is expected to be a very good approximation to the use of the full et current .",
    "calculations where @xmath78 is omitted from the instant current matrix element suggest that the total contribution of @xmath79 to the observables is small .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of @xmath80 as arising from the coupling of the photon to internal charged lines in the crossed - box graph : @xmath80 is a two - body current , and therefore we would expect it _ a priori _ to be small at the momentum - transfers under consideration here . since @xmath81 itself makes a small contribution to observables , using a form of it that only approximately satisfies current conservation",
    "is expected to have an even smaller effect on our numerical results .",
    "we expect that these effects , and the other effects of retardations we have neglected in the current , will only have a minor influence on observables . here",
    "our main goal is to examine the effect of retardation on the vertex functions , and the role that negative - energy states play in the calculation , and so we do not calculate these additional effects .",
    "work is in progress to include these extra terms of the current that are derived in sec .",
    "[ sec - gi ] in the calculation .",
    "we are also calculating meson - exchange currents , such as @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which we _ do _ expect to influence observables .",
    "the first step in obtaining theoretical predictions for the experimental observables in electron scattering on the deuteron is to find the vertex functions @xmath71 and @xmath73 .",
    "we take the four - dimensional kernel @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t(u)4d ] ) to be the sum of single - boson exchanges .",
    "the parameters for these exchanges are taken from the bonn - b obe model , with the exception of the @xmath84-meson coupling , which we leave as a free parameter . from the 4d kernel , @xmath85 , an instant interaction , @xmath86 ,",
    "is easily found , and a corresponding retarded interaction , @xmath87 , can be defined by the systematic procedure outlined above .",
    "these two different interactions are then inserted into the bound - state equation derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma1 - 3d ] ) .",
    "the @xmath84-meson coupling is adjusted so that the @xmath0 bound - state pole in the @xmath88 channel appears at the deuteron mass .",
    "once this is done the deuteron vertex functions @xmath71 and @xmath73 can be extracted .",
    "we calculate these two vertex functions including the effects of negative - energy states and also in the approximation where only positive - energy states contribute .    with vertex functions in hand and using the 3d current @xmath89",
    ", we calculate the electron - deuteron scattering observables @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . the results from such a calculation are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - afull ] , [ fig - bfull ] and [ fig - t20full ] .",
    "we also show experimental data from refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath1 , from refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath2 and from refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath3 .",
    "it should be pointed out though , that a number of two - body effects , such as the differences between @xmath90 and @xmath91 that are needed to restore current conservation , and the usual @xmath82 mec contribution , should be added to our calculations before they can be reliably compared to experimental data .",
    "one of the most interesting features is the close similarity of the results based on the et vertex functions that include retardations and instant vertex functions that do not .",
    "we find that once the @xmath84 coupling is renormalized at @xmath92 ( as must be done to refit the deuteron binding after incorporating the repulsive effects arising from meson retardation ) , the deuteron properties in these two models are remarkably similar .    for comparison , in figs .",
    "[ fig - plusplusonlya ] , [ fig - plusplusonlyb ] and [ fig - plusplusonlyt20 ] we display calculations for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where the effects of negative - energy states are removed .",
    "we see that the inclusion of these states in the calculation makes little difference to any of the observables .",
    "however , comparing the different positions of the minima in figs .",
    "[ fig - bfull ] and [ fig - plusplusonlyb ] we see that including the negative - energy states in the calculation does shift the minimum in @xmath2 to somewhat larger @xmath93 .",
    "a similar effect was observed by van orden _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in calculations of electron - deuteron scattering using the spectator formalism .",
    "however , note that here , in contradistinction to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the inclusion of negative - energy states does _ not _ bring the impulse approximation calculation into agreement with the data .",
    "the fact that negative - energy states seem to have a smaller effect on observables in the et analysis than in the spectator analysis of van orden et al .",
    "@xcite is somewhat surprising .",
    "as pointed out above , the et propagator has twice the negative - energy state propagation amplitude of the gross propagator .",
    "thus , other differences between the et and spectator models , not just differences in the role of negative - energy states in the two approaches , appear to be responsible for the differing results for @xmath94 .",
    "the fact that ref .",
    "@xcite s calculation essentially agrees with the experimental data for @xmath94 is not solely attributable to the gross formalism s treatment of negative - energy states , since our results show that negative - energy states have a much smaller effect .",
    "we also note that the inclusion of retardation moves the minimum in @xmath2 a little higher in @xmath93 but otherwise has little observable effect . again",
    ", this additional effect is not enough to bring the predictions of our model into line with the experimental data .    finally , examining the tensor polarization",
    "@xmath3 we see that all the different models produce results which are very similar .",
    "this suggests that this observable is fairly insensitive to dynamical details of the deuteron model , at least up to @xmath95 .",
    "we find that elimination of the approximations used by hummel and tjon produces only minor changes for the experimentally - measured quantities @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , although the precise location of the minimum in the magnetic form factor @xmath2 does change when meson retardations are included in the calculation .",
    "nevertheless , there is little improvement in the agreement of the impulse - approximation calculations with the experimental data for @xmath2 .",
    "comparing our results with those of a non - relativistic impulse approximation calculation of the same observables ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) strengthens the conclusion of previous authors that neither the consideration of relativistic kinematics for the nucleons and mesons nor the inclusion of negative - energy state effects improves the agreement with the experimental data .",
    "of course , by definition , such a non - relativistic impulse approximation calculation neglects both relativistic effects and two - body current contributions .",
    "indeed , we see here that , as already found by arnold _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and zuilhof and tjon  @xcite , including relativistic effects actually _ worsens _ the agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the inclusion of these effects to all orders in a @xmath96 expansion , as done here and in refs .",
    "@xcite does _ not _ lead to a small correction which brings the theory into closer agreement with the experimental data .",
    "this suggests that the comparative success of a simple non - relativistic impulse approximation calculation is fortuitous .",
    "dynamical mechanisms beyond the impulse approximation appear to play a more important role in this reaction than one would conclude from the non - relativistic calculation .",
    "figures  [ fig - afull ] , [ fig - bfull ] , and [ fig - t20full ] imply that once @xmath93 gets above about 0.5 @xmath97 two - body current contributions become important .",
    "one example of such a two - body current would be meson - exchange current contributions , but it is also possible that other two - body currents are dynamically important in this regime .",
    "the rest of this paper is devoted to a detailed description of our formalism , and to the explanation of technical details pertaining to our calculation that were omitted in the brief sketch of the calculations given here . in section  [ sec - eikonal ]",
    "we present our modified four - dimensional equation for @xmath26 with the correct one - body limit and incorporating a form of the eikonal approximation which is an improvement over that proposed in ref .",

    "we explain the various interactions that are used in calculations of deuteron wave functions .",
    "these can be divided into two classes : instant interactions , and et interactions that include meson retardation . within either of these classes ,",
