    "most of the analyses concerning neutrino oscillations have so far been done within the framework of the theory of two flavor neutrino oscillation . in these scenarios , the observed deficit of solar electron neutrinos",
    "is usually explained by means of @xmath9 oscillations , whereas the lack of atmospheric muon neutrinos is interpreted as a consequence of @xmath10 oscillations .",
    "the main advantage of the two flavor oscillation scenario is that the oscillation probability depends on only two parameters , the mass squared difference @xmath11 and the mixing angle @xmath12 .",
    "recently , it was pointed out by several authors , that in some cases the interpretation of the experimental data in terms of two flavor oscillations might yield misleading and sometimes even wrong results ( see _ e.g. _ ref.@xcite ) and that a three flavor oscillation description is to be favored .",
    "unfortunately , the oscillation probabilities depend in this case on five parameters , two mass squared differences and three mixing angles , which makes it quite hard to deal with the dependence of the probability functions on these parameters .",
    "the most popular three flavor neutrino oscillation scenario is the so called bimaximal mixing scenario @xcite , where two of the mixing angles are maximal , _",
    "i.e. _ , they have values of about @xmath13 , whereas the remaining one is restricted by the chooz experiment to be rather small at least for certain parameter ranges @xcite .",
    "the three flavor oscillation scenario can then be shown to decouple into two distinct scenarios involving two flavors , in which case it is of course much easier to perform a fit to the experimental data .",
    "many authors @xcite use the chooz result to simplify the oscillation probability formulas for three flavors and then perform a fit of the two decoupled two flavor neutrino oscillation scenarios to the experimental data .    in this paper , we will present a numerical fit within a three flavor neutrino mixing scenario to the zenith angle distribution of 850 day atmospheric neutrino super - kamiokande data and 708 day solar neutrino super - kamiokande data . however , we will not make any assumptions about the parameters on which the oscillation probability formulas depend , _",
    "i.e. _ , we fit the scenario in the most general case and for a large parameter range to the experimental data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ kamiotheory ] , we summarize the basic features of three flavor neutrino oscillation theory . in sec .",

    "in three flavor neutrino oscillation theory one assumes the neutrino states with definite flavor @xmath14 , @xmath15 , to be linear superpositions of states with definite mass @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 the unitary mixing matrix @xmath19 is called cabibbo  kobayashi  maskawa ( ckm ) matrix and can generally be parameterized by three mixing angles @xmath20 , where @xmath17 , and three cp - violating phases .",
    "one of the latter were recently claimed to be observable by next generation neutrino detectors @xcite and could lead to physically very interesting consequences .",
    "the other two can be shown to cause no physical effects . however , for this analysis these phases are too small to be important and we will neglect them in what follows .",
    "this implies @xmath21 and therefore we can write the ckm matrix in its ( real ) standard parameterization @xcite as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 . the probability for detection of a neutrino of flavor @xmath25 in a beam of neutrinos consisting exclusively of flavor @xmath26 at the source of the beam is for three flavors given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is kronecker s delta , @xmath29 is the distance from the source to the detector , @xmath30 is the neutrino energy , and @xmath31 is the difference between the squares of the masses corresponding to the mass eigenstates @xmath16 and @xmath32 . since @xmath33 the mass squared differences are not linearly independent , and it is convenient to choose @xmath34 from which follows that @xmath35    so far we have considered the neutrino states to be plane waves , _",
    "i.e. _ , to have a definite momentum .",
    "since the neutrino state is neither produced nor detected with a definite momentum or propagation length , one has to average over @xmath36 as well as other uncertainties in production and detection .",
    "we will here follow closely ref .",
    "@xcite and assume that these uncertainties to be described by a gaussian average @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 . inserting formula ( 3 ) for @xmath40 yields @xmath41 , \\label{probability2}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 and therefore related to the sensitivity of the experiment .",
    "@xmath44 should here be inserted in meters , whereas @xmath45 should be inserted in mev .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 is the so called damping factor and in accordance with ref . @xcite we will choose @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the uncertainties in neutrino energy and propagation length , respectively .    for large values of @xmath46 @xmath50 and the oscillation term vanishes .",
    "the transition probability then becomes a constant dependent on the values of the mixing angles ; the oscillation is said to become `` washed out '' . to proceed , one now has to determine the values of the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the experiments under consideration .",
    "we are going to consider three types of super - kamiokande data , multi - gev @xmath53-like atmospheric neutrino data , multi - gev @xmath54-like atmospheric neutrino data , and solar neutrino data .",
    "the probabilities were taken from ref .",
    "@xcite for 14 data points in an energy range from 6 mev to 12 mev .",
    "the probability is almost constant for all 14 data points .",
    "the path length for solar neutrinos is given by the distance from the sun to earth ( @xmath55 m ) and the uncertainty of the path length is here assumed to be negligible compared to @xmath29 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath56 the damping factor then becomes @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the energy resolution of the experiment .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino data are divided into atmospheric multi - gev @xmath53-like events and atmospheric multi - gev @xmath54-like events . in both cases ,",
    "the flux measurements are performed for five bins , _",
    "i.e. _ , for five different values @xmath59 of the zenith angle @xmath12 , which is defined as the angle between the direction of the measurement and the axis through experiment and the middle of the earth",
    ". therefore , @xmath60 corresponds to straight upward going neutrinos , whereas for @xmath61 the neutrinos are produced in the atmosphere right above the detector .",
    "the experimental data used are 850 day super - kamiokande data and monte carlo no - oscillation predictions for 40 years generated lifetime for the five bins .",
    "the corresponding errors were taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results of the super - kamiokande experiment are usually presented by means of the `` ratio of the ratios '' @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the flux of neutrino flavor @xmath26 .    in summer 1998 , the super - kamiokande collaboration published experimental values for this `` ratio of the ratios '' of @xmath64 for sub - gev events and @xmath65 for multi - gev events @xcite , which was the first direct observation of neutrino oscillations .",
    "however , to be able to fit both , @xmath53-like and @xmath54-like data to the measurements , we will use here the directly measured disappearance rates @xmath66 for @xmath53-like events and @xmath67 for @xmath54-like events .",
    "the main disadvantage of this is the uncertainty in the expected neutrino flux , which was claimed to be up to 20@xmath68 @xcite , due to the unknown flux of cosmic particles hitting the atmosphere . to handle",
    "this one can introduce an overall flux uncertainty factor @xmath69 with values between 0.8 and 1.2 . the actual neutrino flux for the neutrino flavor @xmath26 is then given by @xmath70 .",
    "thus , in absence of neutrino oscillations , the ratio between the theoretical and the measured fluxes would just be @xmath71 , whereas otherwise one obtains @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the transition probability from @xmath26 to @xmath25 , see sec .",
    "[ kamiotheory ] . in",
    "what follows , we are going to neglect the @xmath74 contribution due to too small production cross sections .",
    "the uncertainty in the flux of cosmic rays is then an overall factor common to the ratios @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , of the both remaining neutrino flavors . denoting @xmath77 , one obtains @xmath78 for the electron neutrino ratio and @xmath79 for the muon neutrino ratio .",
    "the value of @xmath80 is theoretically well determined to be about @xmath81 at @xmath82 gev @xcite .",
    "the energy of the measured multi - gev neutrinos is assumed to be @xmath83 gev with negligible uncertainty compared to @xmath30 and we set @xmath84 . the path length for a neutrino that was detected in a bin corresponding to the zenith angle @xmath12 is given by @xmath85 as is easily obtained from geometrical considerations .",
    "here @xmath86 is the radius of the earth and @xmath87 is the typical altitude of the neutrino production point in the atmosphere , which we assumed to be @xmath88 km .",
    "the uncertainty in path length is mainly determined by @xmath89 and therefore @xmath90 the damping factor @xmath46 is thus a function of @xmath12 @xmath91",
    "according to the last section , we have 24 data points , which we can use for the fit to the parameters of the theory : the five bins for @xmath53-like events , the five bins for @xmath54-like events , and the 14 data points for the solar neutrinos .",
    "the function used to obtain the parameters is given by @xmath92 ^ 2 + \\sum_{i=1}^5 { \\rm w}_{\\mu , i}\\frac{1}{r^2_{\\mu , i}(exp ) } \\left[r_{\\mu , i}-r_{\\mu , i}(exp)\\right]^2\\nonumber\\\\   & + & \\sum_{i=1}^{14}{\\rm w}_{sun , i}\\frac{1}{p^2_{sun , i}(exp ) } \\left[p_{sun , i}-p_{sun , i}(exp)\\right]^2\\bigg\\ } , \\label{minfunction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first two sums run over the five bins and the third one over the 14 data points for the solar neutrinos .",
    "the weights have been taken as @xmath93 the mixing angles were constrained to the interval @xmath94 $ ] , whereas for the mass squared differences we assumed one of them to be in the range @xmath95 and the other one in @xmath96 . since these large parameter ranges yield no numerically stable solution , we minimized function ( [ minfunction ] ) for 45 parameter ranges corresponding to all combinations of values for the mass squared differences between @xmath97 for the small mass squared difference and @xmath98 for the larger one .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we chose the following strategy to deal with the flux uncertainty factor @xmath99 : during the search for minima of function  ( [ minfunction ] ) , we set it equal to unity , _ i.e. _ , we neglected the flux uncertainty .",
    "the solutions obtained in this way were then tested for their stability with respect to variations of @xmath99 , see sec .",
    "[ kamiostability ] .    to minimize the function @xmath100 in eq .",
    "( [ minfunction ] ) we generated @xmath101 random values for each of the five parameters in the corresponding range such that we obtained @xmath102 values of the minimization function .",
    "after that we picked the parameter set that yielded the smallest value for the function and repeated this procedure @xmath103 times .",
    "each of the obtained @xmath104 parameter sets then served as starting values for a deterministic minimization procedure , using a sequential quadratic programming method such that one obtains again @xmath104 parameter sets as an end result .",
    "the solutions to the minimization problem can best be obtained by considering tables like table  [ masstable ] , where the best point values for the two mass squared differences for each of the investigated mass regions are shown .",
    "one can see , that for most of the mass regions at least one of the two mass squared differences was obtained on one of the region boundaries . in this case",
    ", we assumed that the value of the corresponding mass squared difference converges towards a better minimum in one of the neighbor regions .",
    "thus , a given parameter region was only considered to contain a solution to the minimization problem , if both values of the mass squared differences were obtained within the boundaries of the region .",
    "note , that the values obtained for @xmath105 are almost randomly distributed in the last column of table  [ masstable ] , _ i.e. _ , in the range @xmath106 .",
    "this is due to a too large value of the damping factor @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ probability2 ] ) such that the minimization function becomes independent of this parameter . only @xmath107 and the mixing angles are in this case fitted to the experimental data .    to keep overview over the various considered parameter regions one can consider table  [ masstable2 ] . here",
    "a region , where a value for @xmath108 was obtained within the boundaries , is marked with an `` @xmath109 '' , whereas a region with a corresponding value for @xmath107 is marked with an `` @xmath110 '' .",
    "one obtains in this way eight regions , marked `` @xmath111 '' in table  [ masstable2 ] , where the mass squared differences are within the region boundaries .",
    "seven of these regions are contained in the first two rows of table  [ masstable2 ] , whereas the eighth one was obtained within the range @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "the parameter values obtained from the minimization procedure with the mass squared differences constrained to these regions correspond to the possible solutions of the minimization problem .",
    "one notices that the regions marked with `` @xmath111 '' split table [ masstable2 ] in three distinct areas , corresponding to three types of solutions , as we will see .",
    "the first of these interesting areas is the one containing the parameter regions in the upper left corner of table [ masstable2 ] , _ i.e. _ , the nine regions in the range @xmath114 , @xmath115 . in this range , there are all together five possible solutions , _",
    "i.e. _ , mass regions , where the mass squared differences were obtained within the region boundaries . to pick the best of the possible solutions for this type , consider table [ minimizationtable ] , where the best point values for the minimization function ( [ minfunction ] ) are shown .",
    "the smallest value of the minimization function was obtained in the region corresponding to @xmath116 , @xmath117 . in all surrounding regions",
    ", we obtained values for the minimization function , which are larger , such that there seems indeed to be a minimum in the region specified above .",
    "thus , the corresponding parameter set is a solution of the minimization problem , and we will denote it by _ solution 1 _ in what follows . considering the rest of table [ minimizationtable ] , one can see that this solution corresponds to the smallest value of the minimization function in the whole investigated parameter range , which means that it provides the best fit to the experimental data , as will be seen in sec .",
    "[ kamiofits ] .",
    "note that the value of the minimization function in the parameter range containing solution 1 is very close to the one obtained in the region @xmath118 .",
    "furthermore , the values for the mass squared differences obtained within these two regions are rather close to each other , and one can not really distinguish , if these two possible solutions correspond to the same minimum or to two distinct minima very close to each other .",
    "the second interesting area of table [ masstable2 ] contains six parameter regions in the range @xmath119 , @xmath120 . here a second type of solution is obtained in the region @xmath121 , @xmath122 , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the last column , eighth row of table [ masstable2 ] .",
    "we will denote this solution by _ solution 2 _ in what follows .",
    "considering now table [ minimizationtable ] , one can see that in one of the neighbor regions we obtained a smaller value for the minimization function .",
    "one has therefore only a `` local '' minimum inside the region containing solution 2 , and the values of the minimization function in the surrounding regions do not converge that obviously towards this region , as they did in the case of solution 1 .",
    "however , in all the surrounding regions at least one of the mass squared differences was obtained on one of the region boundaries , which is why we will consider the region @xmath123 , @xmath122 to contain the second solution of the minimization problem . comparing the corresponding value of the minimization function to the one of solution 1",
    ", one sees that this second solution provides a less exact fit to the experimental data .    finally , the third interesting area is situated in the upper right corner of table [ masstable2 ] , in the range @xmath124 , @xmath125 . here",
    "two regions with both mass squared differences within the region boundaries are obtained .",
    "consideration of table [ minimizationtable ] tells us , that the smallest value for the minimization function was obtained in the parameter region @xmath126 , @xmath127 .",
    "thus , we obtain a third type of solution of the minimization problem , denoted by _ solution 3 _ in what follows . as in the case of solution 2 , there are neighbor regions with smaller values for the minimization function , but they both have at least one of the mass squared differences on one of the region boundaries . note that the value of the minimization function is about five times larger for solution 3 than the one corresponding to solution 1 , and roughly three times larger than the one corresponding to solution 2 .",
    "the parameter values for the three solutions obtained from the analysis in the last section are shown in table [ solutions ] . here the average value obtained from the @xmath103 minimizations are depicted , together with the corresponding standard deviations as well as the best point values .",
    "solution 1 actually corresponds to the most common three flavor neutrino oscillation scenario , with one of the mass squared differences in the `` just - so '' domain ( @xmath128 ) and the other one in the range of possible solutions of the atmospheric neutrino puzzle ( @xmath129 ) . as for our solution , in this common scenario the values of the mixing angles are normally a set with a small value for @xmath130 , and values around @xmath13 for the other two mixing angles , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , _",
    "i.e. _ , one has bimaximal mixing .",
    "the three flavor oscillation scenario can in this case be shown to decouple into two independent oscillation scenarios involving two flavors @xcite .",
    "the two flavor oscillation scenario with the small mass squared difference is then commonly used to describe the solar electron neutrino deficit in terms of @xmath133-@xmath134 oscillations , whereas the scenario with the larger mass squared difference is assumed to describe the atmospheric muon neutrino deficit in terms of @xmath134-@xmath135 oscillations .",
    "however , this approximation is only exact in the case @xmath136 , and the nonzero value of this angle causes a mixing of these two decoupled two flavor scenarios .",
    "this influences in turn the values obtained for the mass squared differences , which might explain the deviation of our result for the large mass parameter @xmath137 from the super - kamiokande result @xmath138 @xcite , which was obtained in the framework of a two flavor oscillation scenario .",
    "note that we obtained this bimaximal solution without putting any restrictions on the parameters .",
    "furthermore , the value we obtained for the second mixing angle @xmath5 implies that @xmath139 , which is in accordance with the upper bound obtained from the chooz experiment @xmath140 @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of solution 1 is the rather large standard deviation of the value obtained for @xmath107 , see table [ solutions ] .",
    "solution 2 , on the other hand , is characterized by a value for the minimization function , which is twice as large as the one corresponding to solution 1 , but all parameters , except for the large mass squared difference , were obtained with very small standard deviations .",
    "as discussed earlier , the minimization function is in this mass range independent of @xmath105 .",
    "this means , that one obtains random numbers for this parameter , which explains the large standard deviation of @xmath105 . only the mixing angles and @xmath141 are in this case fitted to the experimental data . here",
    "the small mass squared difference is lying in the range of possible solutions to the atmospheric neutrino puzzle , whereas the large one is compatible with the results of the liquid scintillator neutrino detector ( lsnd ) experiment @xcite , which yielded a value for the mass squared difference in the ev - range within the framework of a two flavor oscillation scenario .",
    "however , one can see from table [ solutions ] , that the value obtained for the second mixing angle is maximal , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath142 and , unlike for the first solution , it is therefore in this case not possible to reduce the three flavor oscillation scenario to two oscillation scenarios involving two flavors",
    ".    finally , solution 3 has the major disadvantage of a rather large value of the minimization function compared to the other two solutions , as discussed in the last section .",
    "the remarkably large standard deviation of the large mass squared difference can be explained as in the case of the solution 2 , but solution 3 also shows a rather large standard deviation of the third mixing angle @xmath132 .",
    "this solution is actually an `` intersection '' of the first two solutions , with one of the mass squared differences in the `` just - so '' range and the other one in the range obtained by lsnd .",
    "all three mixing angles have values around @xmath143 , where @xmath17 , which means that it is , like in the case of solution 2 , not possible to decouple the three flavor oscillation scenario into a pair of two flavor oscillation scenarios .",
    "figures [ diagramatmos_e ] - [ diagramsolar ] show the results of the fit .",
    "the best point probabilities obtained from the three solutions are depicted as well as compared to the corresponding experimental data including error bars .",
    "let us first consider the results of the fit to the atmospheric electron neutrino data , shown in fig .",
    "[ diagramatmos_e ] . here",
    "solution 1 and solution 3 provide the best fits to the experimental data .",
    "solution 2 shows larger deviations , especially for the two bins with the smallest zenith angles , _",
    "i.e. _ , the largest values of @xmath144 .",
    "the neutrinos measured in these two bins come from right above the detector , which means that the background of cosmic particles is not shielded by the earth .",
    "the experimental data corresponding to these zenith angles have accordingly the largest experimental deviations , and from eqs .",
    "( [ eweight ] ) - ( [ sunweight ] ) one can see , that these bins therefore correspond to the smallest weights .",
    "this explains why the fit is less exact for these zenith angles .",
    "the fact that one obtains a zenith angle independent fit for solution 3 can be understood from consideration of the oscillation lengths @xmath145 where @xmath30 is again the neutrino energy and the @xmath146 are the mass squared differences .",
    "this solution has one of the mass squared differences in the `` just - so '' range and the other one in the ev - range .",
    "the oscillation length corresponding to the small mass squared difference is then far too long to make it possible for the experiment to see any variations in the oscillation probability , whereas in the case of the large mass squared difference the oscillations wash out before the neutrinos reach the detector , due to a too large value of the damping factor @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ probability2 ] ) .    considering next the fit to the atmospheric muon neutrino data , shown in fig .",
    "[ diagramatmos_mu ] , one clearly sees that here solution 1 provides the best fit .",
    "solution 2 has again larger deviations for the two bins with the smallest zenith angle , which as before can be explained by the fact that these bins have the largest experimental errors .",
    "solution 3 provides again a constant fit to the experimental data , for the same reasons as the ones discussed above .",
    "it appears that this solution is definitely not capable of explaining the zenith angle dependence of the atmospheric muon neutrino flux measured by the super - kamiokande detector , and therefore this solution can be ruled out .",
    "finally , all three solutions provide rather good fits to the solar neutrino data , see fig .",
    "[ diagramsolar ] .",
    "solution 1 and solution 3 are seen to yield a constant oscillation probability up to an energy of about @xmath147 . above that energy",
    "the oscillation length becomes of the same order of magnitude as the sun - earth distance such that the oscillation probability obtained from the two solutions starts to vary with energy .",
    "solution 2 yields a constant fit to the solar neutrino data , which can be understood , having in mind that this solution is characterized by one mass parameter in the range @xmath121 and the other one in the ev - range . in both cases ,",
    "the corresponding oscillation lengths are much shorter than the sun - earth distance , and all oscillatory effects wash out before the neutrinos reach the earth .",
    "to summarize , only the solution 1 provides a good fit to all three types of experimental data , whereas solution 3 can be definitely ruled out by the zenith angle dependence of the atmospheric muon neutrino data measured by super - kamiokande .",
    "it remains now to test the stability of the obtained solutions with respect to variation of the flux uncertainty factor introduced in sec .",
    "[ kamiomini ] .",
    "as mentioned before , we performed the minimization procedure setting the flux uncertainty factor @xmath99 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ disappearencerate_e ] ) and eq .",

    "but this factor can vary between @xmath148 and therefore one has to test the solutions obtained in the last section for stability with respect to variations of this flux uncertainty factor .",
    "we saw in the last section , that the solution we denoted by solution 3 in table [ solutions ] can be ruled out by the zenith angle dependence of the atmospheric muon neutrino flux measured by super - kamiokande .",
    "we will therefore only test the stability of solution 1 and solution 2 . to do this",
    ", we applied basically the same minimization procedure as the one described in sec .",
    "[ kamiomini ] , but this time for nine equidistant values of the flux uncertainty factor between @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "again , the angles were restricted to the intervals @xmath151 , where @xmath17 .    in the case of solution 1 ,",
    "the small mass squared difference was constrained to @xmath126 . to choose an interval for the large mass squared difference ,",
    "one has to recall that in one of the neighboring regions of solution 1 , we obtained parameter values , which are very close to those corresponding to this solution , as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ kamioresults ] .",
    "this could mean both that the two parameter sets correspond to two distinct minima or to the same one .",
    "we will here follow the latter assumption , _ i.e. _ , we will assume that there is one minimum of the function ( [ minfunction ] ) somewhere between these two parameter regions . to avoid obtaining",
    "the mass squared differences on the boundary between the two regions , we widened the interval for @xmath105 to @xmath152 . in the case of solution 2 , we restricted both mass parameters to the same intervals as in sec .",

    "all three mixing angles show the largest deviations from the value obtained for @xmath155 for the smallest values of the flux uncertainty factor , whereas for @xmath156 they become almost stable .",
    "somewhat surprising is the high stability of the small mass squared difference , since it was obtained from the minimization procedure with large standard deviations .",
    "the large mass squared difference , finally , grows almost linearly with the flux uncertainty factor , but remains within a region around @xmath157 .",
    "the dependence of the parameters corresponding to solution 2 on the flux uncertainty factor is shown in fig .",
    "[ stabdiagram2 ] .",
    "the mixing angles are clearly seen to be more stable than in the case of solution 1 , they remain within ranges of @xmath158 or less around their values at @xmath159 .",
    "the small mass squared difference , on the other hand , varies much more than the one corresponding to the solution 1 .",
    "finally , the large mass squared difference shows a random distribution , as expected , since the minimization function is independent of this parameter in the mass region corresponding to solution 2 , as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ kamioresults ] .",
    "we have fitted the five parameters of a three flavor neutrino oscillation scenario to experimental values obtained by the super - kamiokande collaboration for atmospheric and solar neutrinos . to obtain numerically stable solutions , we divided a large region for the mass squared difference parameters into 45 smaller regions and performed the fit for each of these regions .",

    "this solution provides a comparably worse fit to the atmospheric electron neutrino data , which is the reason for the larger value of the minimization function corresponding to that solution .",
    "the third solution corresponds to a small mass squared difference in the range @xmath153 and a larger one in the lsnd range . here",
