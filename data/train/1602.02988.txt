    "the idea of influence of x - rays on the ionization structure of hot star winds dates back to the beginning of modern hot star wind studies .",
    "the observations with the _ copernicus _ satellite revealed the problem of `` super - ionization '' connected with the presence of strong p  cygni line profiles of surprisingly high ionization species ( such us or ) in the spectra of early - type stars @xcite .",
    "the existence of these ions in the wind was subsequently proposed to be a result of radiative ionization due to the uv flux @xcite and x - ray photoionization @xcite .    since",
    "then the problem of the influence of x - rays on the wind ionization structure has been addressed also by the solution of kinetic equilibrium ( nlte ) equations .",
    "@xcite showed that the ionization fraction of derived from observation can be reproduced using nlte models , but the models with only atmospheric irradiation can not fully explain the ionization fraction of .",
    "ionization equilibrium calculations that included also the x - ray irradiation ( albeit in a simplified form , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predicted ionization fractions and wind line profiles that agree with observations much better .",
    "their calculations also show that the ionization fraction of dominant ionization states is not affected by x - ray irradiation .",
    "consequently , the radiative driving may proceed nearly unaffected in the presence of x - ray irradiation .",
    "the numerical simulations of instabilities connected with radiative driving @xcite provided more reliable predictions for the x - ray irradiation , especially for the spectral energy distribution of emitted x - rays .",
    "more realistic prescriptions for the x - ray irradiation are used in recent nlte wind models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although empirically - based formulae for the x - ray irradiation also give ionization fractions and spectra that agree with observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because the x - ray radiation affects the wind ionization state , it is able to destroy ions responsible for the wind acceleration if the x - ray source is sufficiently strong .",
    "this happens in high - mass x - ray binaries , where the x - rays originate in the accretion of matter on the compact component . from earlier models @xcite of the stellar wind ionization structure in high - mass x - ray binaries",
    "@xcite realized that the x - ray ionization affects also the radiative force and provided a general picture of the structure of circumstellar environment in such objects .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite revealed a complex structure of the flow influenced by the gravity of the compact object ( accretion wake ) and x - rays ( photoionization wake ) .",
    "the line force in x - ray irradiated stellar winds has to be obtained from the solution of the 3d radiative transfer equation assuming nlte . because this requires formidable effort , the realistic calculations of the line force concentrated on the 1d problem @xcite . while @xcite provide modification for usual force multipliers ( originally introduced by * ? ? ?",
    "* and @xcite ) in the presence of a strong x - ray field , @xcite showed by detailed calculation without using force multipliers that the x - rays produced in wind shocks do not affect the line force significantly .",
    "on the other hand , in x - ray binaries with large x - ray luminosities the influence of the x - ray emission may lead to the decrease of the radiative force and the inhibition of the stellar wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some attention was also given to the importance of xuv / euv radiation for the wind ionization balance following the work of @xcite .",
    "the xuv / euv radiation was studied in connection with the ultraviolet resonance doublet of , which is too weak in comparison with the theory @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that xuv radiation , which can not be directly observed , may explain the observations of lines .",
    "however , subsequent calculations @xcite showed that this explanation is unlikely , because the xuv / euv radiation in an amount that explains the weak observed lines destroys ions responsible for the wind acceleration .    in this review",
    "we focus on understanding how the high energy ( x - ray and euv ) radiation affects the ionization equilibrium and the radiative force . for concreteness we will focus on nlte models with comoving - frame line force of @xcite , which use x - ray irradiation based on model of @xcite or assume a power - law external irradiation .",
    "however , corresponding results for ionization structure can be derived also with other codes .",
    "historically , the observations of lines of ions with higher degree of ionization ( e.g , , ) were used as an argument for the existence of an additional source of ionizing radiation . however , this argument is based just on an oversimplification of kinetic ( nlte ) equations , which can be avoided only by a detailed numerical analysis .",
    "we demonstrate this on the ionization ratio of and .",
    "let us assume that the populations of the ground levels dominate for these ions , i.e. populations of excited states can be neglected .",
    "let us also assume that the collisional rates can be neglected .",
    "both these assumptions are justified in stellar winds . in such case",
    "the ionization balance between the and ions follows from the kinetic equilibrium equations @xcite as @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are number densities of and ions , respectively , @xmath3 is the radiative ionization rate , and @xmath4}\\ ! e^{-\\frac{h\\nu}{kt } } \\,{\\mathrm{d}}\\nu\\ ] ] is the radiative recombination rate ( an asterisk denotes the lte value ) . in these expressions , @xmath5 is the photoionization cross - section with the photoionization edge at the frequency @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the mean intensity of radiation .",
    "approximating the integrals in eqs .   and by values of the integrands at @xmath6 and taking into account that for this frequency ( high radiation energy ) holds @xmath8 , we derive from eq .",
    "@xmath9 the fraction @xmath10 can be evaluated using the saha equation @xmath11 yielding @xmath12 where we assumed unity ionic partition functions and @xmath13 is the free electron number density . from this equation",
    "it seems that the ionization ratio is directly proportional to the mean radiation intensity @xmath14 at a given ionization frequency @xmath6 . using values appropriate for the model supergiant with @xmath15 ( with stellar mass @xmath16 and radius @xmath17 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the radius of roughly @xmath18 , namely @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 we obtain in absence of additional sources of ionizing radiation from eq .   the ionization ratio @xmath23 .",
    "this indicates low ionization fraction and a need for higher ionizing radiation to enhance the abundance to values inferred from observations .",
    "however , from our full nlte models calculated using our code @xcite , which consider reliable model ions ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a sufficient number of energy levels , we obtain for the same wind location @xmath24 .",
    "the reason for the difference is that the kinetic equilibrium equations are quite complex and their oversimplification may lead to incorrect results . in the particular case of ionization fraction , the most important ionization process is not that from the ground level , but those from excited levels .",
    "although upper levels are less populated , they are closely coupled with the ground level by strong bound - bound transitions . moreover , their ionization energies are lower and they fall within frequencies with higher radiation flux .",
    "the effect is even stronger for the ion @xcite .",
    "consequently , care has to be taken when making the conclusions about the existence of additional ionizing radiation source just from the observations of or lines . @xcite",
    "and @xcite showed that in many cases it is possible to obtain sufficient abundance of by proper treatment of the kinetic equilibrium equations without any additional source of x - ray radiation .",
    "although it is generally true that an additional ionization source shifts the degree of ionization , due to the complexity of the processes involved in the kinetic equilibrium equations , we can not claim that the presence of a particular ion is caused exclusively by radiation at a chosen frequency .",
    "the above example of and ionization fractions illustrates also a potential importance of ionization by xuv radiation with frequencies larger than the ionization edge odecas , pakupa .",
    "we first discuss the influence of intrinsic x - rays created in the wind of single stars .",
    "we assume that the x - ray generation is connected with the line - driving instability @xcite which steepens into highly supersonic shocks @xcite .",
    "we use our nlte wind models with cmf line force , which consistently solve for the wind hydrodynamical and thermodynamical structure .",
    "our models include all relevant processes that affect the level populations , i.e. , radiative and collisional excitation and deexcitation , radiative and collisional ionization and recombination , and the auger processes .",
    "the corresponding radiative ionization cross - sections are mostly taken from the opacity and iron projects @xcite .",
    "these cross - sections include the auto - ionization and dielectronic recombination . in our models",
    "we include the fits ( by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the x - ray emission generated from the hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite .",
    "the models and methods are described by @xcite in detail .    in figs .",
    "[ obrionicno ] and [ obrionisis ] we compare the predicted ionization fractions of selected elements with observations .",
    "the comparison of the ionization fraction calculated with and without x - ray emission shows that x - rays do not significantly influence the ionization fraction of ions with low ionization energies , such us or , except for the lowest effective temperatures and outer wind regions .",
    "ionization fractions of ions with higher ionization energies ( e.g. , ) are affected by x - rays .",
    "the ionization fraction is influenced by x - rays only for cooler o stars ( and only in outer wind regions ) .",
    "the ionization fractions derived from fitting of observed uv spectra with theoretical ones ( assuming wind mass - loss rates ) in general agree with ionization fractions predicted using hydrodynamic nlte wind models .",
    "however , there are some exceptions , for example the ionization fraction of derived from observations is significantly lower than the predicted ionization fraction ( see fig .",
    "[ obrionicno ] ) .",
    "a high ionization fraction of ( see fig .  [ obrionicno ] ) derived from observations is a consequence of x - rays , which can be nicely reproduced by nlte models with additional x - ray source .",
    "we also note that our smooth stationary wind models and the observational diagnostics of ionization fractions neglect inhomogeneities which are present in the wind and which may be connected for example with clumping @xcite , or with effect of binary component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    a further insight into the importance of individual ionization processes can be obtained from the study of radial variations of ionization fractions . as an example we plot the radial variations of the nitrogen ionization fractions in the supergiant wind model calculated by our code for @xmath25 in fig .",
    "[ 375 - 1-ion ] . here",
    "we compare the ionization structure of three different wind models : a model with an additional x - ray source and with auger ionization , model with additional x - ray source but without auger ionization , and model without any additional x - ray source .",
    "the region close to the stellar surface ( for @xmath26 ) is opaque for x - rays .",
    "consequently , the ionization fractions of most abundant ions ( , ) are not influenced by the additional sources of x - rays close to the stellar surface and only minor higher ions ( e.g. , and ) are affected by the tiny amount of x - rays deeply penetrating the wind ( upper panel of fig .  [ 375 - 1-ion ] ) .",
    "the wind regions with larger radius ( for @xmath27 ) are less opaque for the transmitted x - ray photons and , consequently , they are more prone to change their ionization state as a result of the presence of x - rays .    individual nitrogen ions are influenced in different ways by x - rays .",
    "the ionization fraction of is increased as a result of the direct ionization from , but is also affected by ionization to and recombination from the higher ion .",
    "the ionization fraction of is increased by both auger and direct ionization .",
    "is generated due to the direct ionization of @xcite .",
    "x - rays influence mostly minor ionization states in single hot stars , consequently the wind mass - loss rate is not significantly influenced by x - rays and the terminal velocity is typically only by 1020% percent higher , especially in stars with weaker ionizing continua ( with @xmath28 , @xcite ) .",
    "the implications of x - ray irradiation may be more significant in x - ray binaries due to their larger x - ray luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we plot the radial velocity in the supergiant wind with @xmath29 for different amounts of external x - ray irradiation with an irradiating source located at @xmath30 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "for low x - ray luminosity , @xmath31 , x - rays do not significantly influence the radiative force . for higher x - ray luminosities , @xmath32 , x - rays influence the dominant ionization states , which leads to a decrease of the radiative force close to the x - ray source ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a typical kink in the velocity profile develops as a result of weak radiative force @xcite . with increasing external source x - ray luminosity the position of the kink moves towards the star and",

    "the x - ray ionization in the kink is so strong that the radiative driving becomes inefficient and the wind stagnates .",
    "if this happens for velocities lower than the escape speed , then the wind material may fall back on the star ( c.f .",
    "as soon as the kink reaches the critical point , where the mass loss rate is determined , the x - rays lead to wind inhibition .",
    "we define the critical point as a point where the speed of the abbott waves , the fastest waves in the wind , is equal to the wind velocity @xcite .",
    "the influence of x - rays depends not only on the external x - ray luminosity , but also on the location of the x - ray source . therefore , for stars with roughly the same parameters ( i.e. , the same luminosity class and the temperature differences of about 20% ) it is possible to construct a diagram of x - ray luminosity vs.  the optical depth parameter ( see fig .  [ txobr ] ) .",
    "the optical depth parameter @xcite @xmath33 characterizes the radial optical depth between the stellar surface and the x - ray source . for a given star ( with fixed mass - loss rate @xmath34 and terminal velocity @xmath35 ) , the optical depth parameter @xmath36 in eq .",

    "however , for some stars with mass - loss rates lower than this value the predicted mass - loss rates are by order of magnitude higher than those derived from observations @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called  weak wind problem \" .",
    "the explanation of the  weak wind problem \" may lie in the low density of the wind . as a result of the low wind density the shock cooling length may become comparable with the hydrodynamical length scale , that is , the shocks change from radiative to adiabatic @xcite .",
    "consequently , there is a possibility that once the wind of these stars is heated by the shocks it is not able to cool down radiatively , and remains hot and therefore unaffected by the radiative acceleration @xcite .",
    "such shocks occur well above the critical point @xcite , and consequently do not influence the mass - loss rate .",
    "this means that the mass - loss rate of stars with the  weak wind problem \" is roughly the same as the theory predicts .",
    "a high temperature of the winds precludes reliable determination of the mass - loss rates from uv lines .",
    "this conclusion may be supported by the observation of bow shocks around stars with weak wind ( @xmath53 oph and ae aur ) , which require significantly higher mass - loss rates than inferred from uv observations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the observed arc structures are dust waves , they may point to lower mass - loss rates @xcite .",

    "the x - rays of stars with low - density winds may be so strong that they may lead to a significant decrease of the radiative force and wind mass - loss rate @xcite .",
    "this would mean that the mass - loss rate is indeed as low as deduced from observations .",
    "however , @xcite argue that for realistic x - ray source parameters the modification of the ionization equilibrium by x - rays is not strong enough to significantly affect the mass - loss rate .",
    "this result is also supported by @xcite , who using their nlte models showed that the observed level of x - ray emission in low - luminosity stars does not lead to such a decrease of the radiative force and mass - loss rates that would explain the problem with too weak wind line profiles .",
    "because the radiatively driven hot star winds are highly supersonic , they can easily produce large amounts of x - rays . the x - rays influence the ionization balance in the stellar wind .",

    "the radiative force is not affected by x - rays in single o stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the x - rays in hmxbs are so strong that they affect the radiative force , because highly ionized elements are not able to accelerate the wind efficiently .",

    "<S> hot stars emit large amounts of x - rays , which are assumed to originate in the supersonic stellar wind . </S>",
    "<S> part of the emitted x - rays is subsequently absorbed in the wind and influences its ionization state . because hot star winds are driven radiatively </S>",
    "<S> , the modified ionization equilibrium affects the radiative force . </S>",
    "<S> we review the recent progress in modelling the influence of x - rays on the radiative equilibrium and on the radiative force . </S>",
    "<S> we focus particularly on single stars with x - rays produced in wind shocks and on binaries with massive components , which belong to the most luminous objects in x - rays .    </S>",
