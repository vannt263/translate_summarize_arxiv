    "the physics of anderson localization transitions has been intensively studied for almost half a century , yet new aspects of this phenomenon continue to emerge @xcite . among many recent developments , the theory of anderson transitions has been used to classify topological insulators and analyze their robust properties @xcite , and to study thermalization behavior in many - body interacting systems @xcite . furthermore , new systems have been proposed that exhibit anderson localization physics , for example in photonic systems @xcite and ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "one approach that has recently been applied to study anderson transitions has been the use of quantum information and entanglement measures to probe the correlations of many - body states .",
    "for example , the spatial entanglement of quantum states reveals the non - local properties of many - body wave functions @xcite which naturally suggests its usefulness for identifying localized and delocalized states . additionally , entanglement is particularly useful in capturing universal properties that can not be obtained through the expectation value of local operators @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been used in condensed matter systems to gain insight into the nature of different phases of matter and the critical points that separate them @xcite .    over the past few years",
    "there have been a number of articles that focus on applying entanglement methods to disordered fermion systems . in [ ] , for example , the scaling of the entanglement entropy was studied to understand a disordered system at criticality . in [ ] , the von neumann entanglement entropy was analyzed using the multi - fractal spectrum of critical wave functions at localization transitions , and in [ ] , the multi - fractal spectrum of disordered systems was shown to have connections with the rnyi entropy of the single - particle states . in [ ] and",
    "[ ] , relations were found between the level spacing statistics of the hamiltonians of disordered topological insulators and of their corresponding spatial entanglement spectrum from which critical delocalized states were identified .",
    "recent work has also considered the entanglement properties of low - dimensional systems with correlated disorder@xcite .    in this article , we complement these studies by analyzing the utility of several different entanglement methods for determining signatures of anderson localization transitions . spatial entanglement methods , such as those used in refs .",
    "[ ] have given insight into metal - insulator transitions and topological - to - anderson - insulator transitions .",
    "recently , in ref . [ ] , the momentum entanglement spectrum was proposed and used to elucidate the nature of metal - insulator transitions in one - dimensional disordered fermion systems .",
    "this was followed by a recent article which uses momentum - entanglement to study correlated disorder in low - dimensional models@xcite . in our work we will focus solely on one - dimensional fermionic models .",
    "we study a particular set of models with anderson transitions that can be precisely determined either analytically or numerically in order to calibrate our entanglement techniques .",
    "although most of the focus is on free - fermion models , we also perform calculations on an interacting model , and discuss a generalization of the single - particle entanglement signatures to the many - body case .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : one ] by reviewing the notion of bipartite quantum entanglement for generic systems and the simpler case of free - fermion models .",
    "we discuss the different types of entanglement partitions that we will apply in our analysis , and the dual nature of spatial and momentum entanglement for disordered systems . after developing this intuition",
    "we move on to some explicit calculations . in section",
    "[ sec : entanglement1 ] we discuss two types of one - dimensional lattice models ( i ) the random n - mer models which have correlated disorder and ( ii ) the quasi - crystal aubry - andr model .",
    "the localization transitions in these models have been previously studied and identified , and we evaluate several different types of entanglement measures to study the critical behavior .",
    "after calibrating with these two models we add interactions to the aubry - andr model and study its entanglement properties .",
    "finally in section [ sec : entanglement2 ] we study a disordered topological insulator model and develop a hybrid momentum - orbital entanglement partition that clearly illustrates the localization transition .",
    "let us briefly review how bipartite entanglement of a given quantum state @xmath0 is quantified .",
    "we start by dividing the hilbert space of many - body states into two subspaces , say @xmath1 and @xmath2 , such that : ( 1 ) no states are shared between both subspaces ; and ( 2 ) their union reproduces the original hilbert space of the system . given this partition , bipartite entanglement",
    "can be quantified using the so - called von - neumann entropy , which is defined as @xmath3 where the reduced density matrix @xmath4 is obtained by first constructing the density matrix @xmath5 of the full system , and then tracing out the degrees of freedom that correspond to the subspace @xmath2 .    to see why eq . [ sa ] is connected with the concept of entanglement",
    ", we can make use of the so - called schmidt decomposition of @xmath0 .",
    "given @xmath0 , we can always find its schmidt decomposition , which reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are sets of many - body basis states that span the subspaces @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . from this expression",
    ", we see that the set of eigenvalues @xmath9 controls the degree to which @xmath0 can be factorized into states from the subspaces @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in other words ,",
    "the set @xmath9 controls the degree of quantum entanglement of the state @xmath10 for example , we can use eq .",
    "[ schmidt ] to explicitly compute the reduced density matrix of subspace @xmath1 .",
    "this leads to the expression @xmath11=\\sum_n",
    "\\lambda_n^2 { | \\phi_n^a \\rangle}{\\langle \\phi_n^a |},\\ ] ] from which we conclude , using eq.[sa ] , that @xmath12 the von - neumann entanglement entropy is a single number one can calculate from the @xmath13 but the full set , which is the so - called  entanglement - spectrum \" represents the full information about the wavefunction under the @xmath1-@xmath2 partitioning@xcite .",
    "the calculation of the entanglement spectrum and @xmath14 can be simplified for non - interacting fermions@xcite . in the absence of interactions , the quantum state of the full system @xmath15",
    "can always be written as a slater determinant .",
    "a consequence of this is that any correlation function can be expressed in terms of the correlation matrix @xmath16_{ij}={\\langle \\omega |}c^{\\dagger}_i c_j{| \\omega \\rangle}=\\text{tr}\\left(\\rho c^{\\dagger}_i c_j\\right),\\ ] ] using wick s theorem ; here @xmath17 represent some fermion degrees of freedom , e.g. , lattice site , momentum , spin etc .",
    "since the reduced density matrix @xmath18 must also reproduce wick s theorem when the indices are restricted such that @xmath19 then it can be shown@xcite that the reduced density matrix must take the exponential form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a normalization factor that ensures @xmath22 and the indices @xmath23 label states within @xmath1 .",

    "typically diagonalizes @xmath27 to obtain the eigenvalues @xmath28 ( which lie between @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) commonly referred to as the single - particle entanglement spectra . from the @xmath28",
    "one can construct the eigenvalues of @xmath25 to obtain the set @xmath31 ( which lie between @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) which are commonly referred to as the single - particle entanglement energies . from the @xmath31 one can derive the ( many - body ) entanglement spectrum @xmath34 of @xmath18 through the relation @xmath35 , where @xmath36 indicates a many - body state of of @xmath24 with occupation numbers @xmath37 for each single - particle entanglement energy state @xmath38 with energy @xmath39    the entanglement entropy can generically be written as @xmath40 using the expressions for @xmath41 in terms of @xmath42 ( which in turn can be written in terms of of the eigenvalues @xmath28 of @xmath27 ) one finally obtains the simplified expression@xcite @xmath43 the entanglement entropy , and additionally , all entanglement quantities of a free - fermion ground state @xmath0 can thus be understood by analyzing the @xmath44 note that , from eq .",
    "[ corr ] , the eigenvalues @xmath28 always lie between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "because of this , the entanglement of a system is determined by how close the @xmath45 get to @xmath46 we will make use of the single - particle entanglement spectrum to analyze the entanglement of the free - fermion models we study here in addition to the entanglement entropy itself . for interacting models this simplification no longer holds and one must calculate the @xmath47 directly from the many - body reduced density matrix .      in this paper",
    ", we refer to the partition of the hilbert space as an _ entanglement cut _ that is performed on the system . going back to the expression eq .",
    "[ schmidt ] , we note that the degree to which @xmath0 is close to being factorizable in the partitioned basis is sensitive to the type of partition that is chosen . for example , if we were to choose a partition a and b for which all but one ( say n=1 ) of the @xmath13 s in the schmidt - decomposition are zero , then @xmath48 . in such a case , the state @xmath0 would not be entangled with respect to the partition that was chosen .",
    "but if we were to change the partition and choose different subspaces @xmath49 and @xmath50 we could find a partition such that all the @xmath13 s are equal in magnitude , and then we would find @xmath51 , which is a highly entangled state . because of this sensitivity of the entanglement to the choice of partition , we can obtain a more complete picture of the quantum properties of @xmath0 by making appropriate variations of the entanglement cut .",
    "typically , physical motivation will guide this choice .",
    "some types of partitions , other than the conventional spatial cut , that have been studied in previous work include orbital @xcite , particle @xcite , spin @xcite and momentum @xcite .",
    "in the case of one - dimensional disordered fermions , there are a number of possible cuts that can be considered which are physically relevant .",
    "spatial entanglement is the most conventional possibility .",
    "it is a basic measure of localization because it probes the degree to which extended states are able to correlate the two parts of the system . at the same time",
    ", localization is related with the interference between forward and backward traveling states that ultimately is at the heart of disorder - induced localization .",
    "hence , momentum entanglement will also serve as an insightful and complementary way to study the disordered ground state .",
    "finally , interesting anderson transitions occur in systems with internal degrees of freedom that are correlated with the electron motion , such as in topological insulators . performing entanglement cuts with respect to such internal degrees of freedom",
    "will also exhibit interesting behavior as the system transits into the localized phase .",
    "we consider all of these cases below .",
    "before we begin our main discussion , let us briefly build up some simple intuition about how entanglement encodes information relevant to disordered fermions . to begin , we consider how localization is exemplified in the spatial and momentum entanglement spectrum .",
    "the simplest situation we can consider is a quantum state of a single particle that is spatially delocalized . in other words ,",
    "the particle moves freely throughout the system .",
    "the simplest example of this type of state is , of course , a plane - wave given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the momentum wave vector and @xmath54 the corresponding spatial correlation matrix reads",
    "@xmath55 we want to cut the system in half , which is effected by restricting the indices to the range @xmath56.$ ] the @xmath57 entanglement modes that result from the eigenvalues of this correlation matrix , for any choice of @xmath53 , are @xmath58 and @xmath29 , with the latter being @xmath59-fold degenerate .",
    "it follows that a single particle in a plane - wave state has @xmath60 spatial entanglement entropy when the system is partitioned in half .",
    "this illustrates the intuition that generic delocalized states typically contribute order @xmath61 entropy to the spatial entanglement entropy , which indicates that the two halves of the system become correlated .    on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding momentum entanglement correlation matrix for the same state reads @xmath62 as an example , we can choose to trace out momentum states in the range @xmath63,$ ] one reason being that , in some of the models that we will consider , this range corresponds to left - moving states and the remaining modes are all right - moving .",
    "hence , we are essentially probing correlations between right and left movers . using this type of partition , the momentum entanglement modes are @xmath30 and @xmath29 , with again the latter being @xmath59-degenerate .",
    "we thus obtain a momentum entanglement entropy @xmath64 .",
    "this is , of course , a trivial result because the state @xmath65 is trivially a product state in momentum space .",
    "now , upon the introduction of disorder , such plane wave states will scatter and eventually localize at sufficiently strong disorder .",
    "we should then contrast the case of a delocalized state with that of a completely localized state at a position @xmath66 given by @xmath67 . in this case , the spatial and momentum correlation matrices read @xmath68 in this completely localized case , it is the spatial entanglement entropy which vanishes .",
    "the momentum entanglement , on the other hand , has a @xmath58 entanglement mode that leads to a momentum entanglement entropy @xmath60 when using the same cut as above .",
    "hence , the spatial and momentum entanglement behave in a dual fashion with respect to localized and delocalized states .    in the general situation of an occupied fermi sea",
    "there will be more than one single - particle state filled . in this case , one might conjecture that a ground state with more than one delocalized particle will increase the spatial entanglement in an additive manner , for example , each additional occupied plane wave state could add an extra @xmath61 contribution when cut in half .",
    "it turns out , however , that the behavior for more than one particle can be affected significantly due to interference effects .",
    "the spatial correlation matrix for the case of @xmath69 particles occupying plane - wave states with wave vectors @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 each matrix element represents a sum of phases that depend on the particular choice of the set @xmath72 .",
    "because of this , the matrix elements of the correlation matrix can be either enhanced or suppressed depending on which states are occupied .",
    "an analogous case occurs for momentum entanglement when more than one spatially localized state is occupied .",
    "so , while the connection between localization / delocalization and entanglement immediately seems plausible , the details can be complicated . in this work we will study some interesting effects that this interference in the correlation matrix can have on the entanglement of the system .",
    "finally , we mention how the entanglement can carry signatures of the configuration of the internal degrees of freedom in the presence of disorder . in practice",
    ", this will be particularly relevant when the momentum vector and the internal degree of freedom are correlated , such as what occurs in systems with spin - orbit coupling .",
    "one simple family of states we can consider is a spin @xmath58 particle in a state parameterized by momentum @xmath53 , given by @xmath73 .",
    "that is , this state is such that the spin rotates throughout the bz and is explicitly entangled in the spin degree of freedom in a momentum dependent way . as we will discuss later ,",
    "this type of rotation property in momentum space can have an important impact on the physics of the system .",
    "if we introduce disorder , one might suspect that scattering processes can potentially destroy the correlation between the spin and the momentum degree of freedom .",
    "for example , as localization is induced , there will be a corresponding broadening of the momentum space features , and the specific configuration of the internal degree of freedom in momentum space might become blurred .",
    "if this happens , we then expect that such an effect will be apparent in the structure of both the orbital and momentum entanglement . to what extent this happens",
    "is something that we wish to understand in this work and will discuss in section [ sec : entanglement2 ] .",
    "now that we have introduced the notation , the concept of different entanglement cuts , and some simple examples , we will move on to discuss the entanglement properties of several types of 1d free - fermion models . in sec .",
    "[ sec : entanglement1 ] we will discuss the random @xmath69-mer models and the aubry - andr model , both of which exhibit metal - insulator transitions and have only a single on - site degree of freedom .",
    "we also discuss some effects of interactions on the aubry - andr model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : entanglement2 ] we will discuss a chiral symmetric topological insulator model in the aiii class in the presence of disorder potentials that preserve the chiral symmetry . this type of model , in addition to having interesting momentum and spatial entanglement structure , will also yield orbital entanglement since there are two degrees of freedom per site .",
    "in this section we focus on one - dimensional disordered models with delocalized states that can exhibit metal - insulator transitions .",
    "one dimensional disordered systems generically exhibit localization for any disorder strength as long as the system does not obey any particular symmetry @xcite .",
    "this would seem to imply that it is not possible to study delocalization transitions at a finite disorder strength in 1d .",
    "it has been shown , however , that there are special models with correlated disorder that preempt the occurrence of anderson localization , and thus possess metallic ground states .",
    "an example is the so - called random dimer model ( rdm ) @xcite and its generalizations , and the quasi - periodic system referred to as the aubry - andr model ( aam ) @xcite . although the aam is not actually a disordered system , it does have a localization transition for reasons similar to that of the rdm .",
    "both models exhibit metallic behavior at finite disorder potential strengths , and eventually become anderson insulators",
    ".    we will thus explore the localization properties of these models using entanglement techniques .",
    "for such systems , there are two natural ways in which the hilbert space can be partitioned , namely the spatial and momentum entanglement cuts we mentioned previously . because of the nature of the delocalized state",
    ", it will turn out that for these classes of models the momentum entanglement cut will prove particularly insightful .",
    "the random n - mer models describe some of the simplest one - dimensional systems with disorder that allow for a metallic phase in one dimension@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the general model is @xmath74 where @xmath75 labels the lattice sites , @xmath76 is the lattice size , @xmath77 is the tunneling matrix element between nearest neighbors , and @xmath78 takes on two values @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the important property of @xmath78 is that the value @xmath79 always has to be placed on @xmath69 consecutive sites so that `` n - mers '' are distributed throughout the lattice .",
    "the key to explain why this type of disorder leads to delocalized states in the energy spectrum is the fact that there is a complete suppression of scattering between certain momenta . to see this , note that the fourier elements of the disorder potential @xmath78 are given by @xmath81,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 , the @xmath83 denote the random positions of the n - mers , @xmath84 depends on the particular disorder realization , and @xmath85 is independent of any randomness .",
    "the key observation is that the structure factor @xmath86 has zeroes at @xmath87 @xmath88 .",
    "scattering is consequently suppressed for all @xmath89 .",
    "if we calculate the energies of the points in the translationally invariant bandstructure that are nested by the @xmath90 of these suppressed scattering events we obtain @xmath91 in other words , near each of these special energies @xmath92 there will be a suppression of left and right - mover scattering .",
    "this suggests that localization is inhibited for states near the energies @xmath92 , which is indeed the case .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that in the neighborhood of these so - called resonant energies , a finite fraction of the eigenstates have a localization length of the order of the lattice size .",
    "thus , the @xmath93 zeroes of @xmath94 lead to metallic phases in one - dimensional disordered fermions when @xmath95 is tuned to the neighborhood of @xmath96    if the disorder becomes sufficiently strong , all single - particle states will localize even at the resonant energies .",
    "for the n - mer models , the delocalized states exist up to critical values of the disorder strength @xmath97 given by @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 . in what follows , we will set @xmath100 and @xmath101 , so that the disorder strength will be measured by @xmath80 .",
    "we will focus on the n=1 ( uncorrelated disorder ) , n=2 ( random dimer model ) , and n=3 ( random trimer model ) cases .",
    "the rdm has an extended state at @xmath102 which survives up to the critical disorder @xmath103 . for the random trimer model ( rtm )",
    "there are two extended - state regions , but we will focus on the extended state that exists at @xmath104 which survives for @xmath105 $ ] .",
    "having discussed the basic aspects of the random @xmath69-mer models , we now analyze how the metal - insulator transition manifests itself in the entanglement properties . the momentum entanglement and some spatial entanglement for these models",
    "was studied earlier in ref .",
    "[ ] , and additionally the spatial entanglement was considered in ref .",
    "[ ] . to study these models , there are two parameters at our disposal that allow us to tune the localization transitions , namely the fermi energy @xmath95 and the disorder strength @xmath106 by varying both of these parameters , we can drive the system between the metallic and insulating states .",
    "we will start with the fermi energy @xmath95 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_set17 ] , we show four columns : ( i ) the fourier components of the scattering potential showing the zeroes of scattering , ( ii , iii ) the spatial and momentum entanglement spectrum as the fermi level is varied , and ( iv ) the localization length as a function of energy . in appendix [ appa ]",
    "we explain how the localization length is calculated .",
    "the rows correspond to the system with uncorrelated disorder ( first row ) , the rdm ( second row ) , and the rtm ( third row ) .",
    "for all of these plots , the disorder strength is @xmath107 , which means that both the rdm and the rtm have resonant states in their energy spectrum .",
    "the localization length is shown here to confirm the energies for which delocalization occurs .    from the spatial entanglement spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig_set17 ] , one can see by eye that the entanglement modes exhibit level repulsion when the fermi - level is in the delocalized region , i.e. , when the ground state is metallic .",
    "this is consistent with the results of ref . [ ] which made similar observations when the fermi - level was tuned to a delocalized state in a chern insulator band .",
    "the level repulsion causes the entire region between @xmath108 $ ] to be filled with eigenvalues since the levels are more rigidly spaced . in regions near the edges of the bandwidth , where localized states should dominate , the entanglement eigenvalues do not appear to have any particular structure .",
    "the filling of the region between @xmath108 $ ] is much more sparse as the levels can cluster together since they are not repelling . for the case of uncorrelated disorder ( @xmath109 )",
    "there are no obvious features in the entanglement nor in the localization length .",
    "although the signatures in the spatial entanglement spectrum do not appear to be particularly clear , the disorder - averaged entanglement entropy does reveal the delocalized nature of the extended state .",
    "in particular , it is well known that the entanglement entropy in a critical state of a subsystem of size @xmath110 ( with total system size @xmath76 ) varies as @xmath111+s_0 , \\label{scal}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 is a non - universal constant , and @xmath113 is a universal coefficient that depends on the critical properties of the ground state ( and is the central charge when considering conformal field theories ) .",
    "we show the disorder - averaged spatial entanglement entropy for the rdm and rtm in fig .",
    "[ fig_criticality]a , b .",
    "the scaling function is shown as the red curve , and the blue dots are the numerical calculation when @xmath95 is at aligned to the delocalized resonant state .",
    "the green dots correspond to when the disorder strength is strong enough to localize everything .",
    "the match between the scaling function and the numerical calculation is clear . for the clean system , i.e. , the 1d tight - binding chain , @xmath114 for all fermi - energies away from the band - edges . in certain disordered systems , such as the disordered xx spin-@xmath58 chain",
    ", this coefficient acquires an additional @xmath115 factor@xcite . for the rdm and rtm , however , we obtain @xmath114 even with disorder . this result",
    "is also obtained in ref . .",
    "the simple reason that we find this result is due to the fact that the rdm and rtm potentials do not couple the states at the resonance energy and thus these fermions remain free . the low - energy theory will remain a @xmath114 dirac fermion .",
    "let us now proceed to discuss the momentum entanglement in these models .",
    "the momentum entanglement spectrum shows much sharper behavior than the spatial entanglement spectrum : in the metallic state the entanglement modes are largely clustered near @xmath29 and @xmath30 , whereas they fill the region in between @xmath29 and @xmath30 as the fermi level is moved away from resonance and into localized states . as we mentioned before , the scattering profiles of the rdm and rtm potentials exhibit exact zeroes in the fourier components which are responsible for stabilizing the delocalized states of such models .",
    "in particular , there is a clear connection between the existence of the metallic phase at finite disorder , and the behavior of its corresponding momentum entanglement .",
    "since momentum entanglement yields information about the build up of correlations between left and right movers , the fact that momentum entanglement is suppressed in the metallic state can be interpreted as a decrease of correlations between left and right movers , which thus preempts the anderson insulator at these energies .",
    "this connection is natural , since the return probability is an important ingredient in the localization transition @xcite .",
    "note that , in all of these examples , the momentum entanglement turns out to be sharply suppressed even though the occupied fermi sea of the ground state contains single - particle states below the resonant energies that are actually localized . as we mentioned in a previous section",
    ", a single localized state by itself leads to an entanglement of order @xmath115 for this type of cut .",
    "one would naturally expect that all of the entanglement from the entire set of occupied localized states would add up .",
    "however , the fact that there is not a large accumulation of entanglement when @xmath95 is at resonance suggests that there is significant destructive interference in the correlation matrix similar to what we discussed for eq . [ interference ] .    to understand this observation",
    ", one can think of the zeroes of the scattering potential as a mechanism that prevents mixing between states in the energy spectrum that are separated by the resonant energies .",
    "for example , for the case of the rdm , the suppressed scattering in the neighborhood of @xmath102 is very effective in keeping states below and above this resonant energy from mixing with the opposite group at weak disorder . as a consequence ,",
    "the set of states below zero energy ( call this set @xmath116 ) hybridize primarily among themselves .",
    "effectively , the absolute suppression at @xmath102 divides the spectrum into two pieces @xmath117 and @xmath118 that are not mixed for weak - disorder .",
    "this means that , upon constructing a slater determinant with @xmath119 we can approximate the single - particle states by @xmath120 . as a result , there is a significant simplification in the form of the slater determinant ground state @xmath121where the last equality is true up to a global phase ( which does not enter the calculation of the density matrix ) . in other words , the fermi sea will approximately reproduce the ground state of delocalized states of the clean system .",
    "in fact , while the energies of the states below @xmath95 will be affected by disorder , the same orbitals that were occupied in the clean - limit will be occupied in the weak - disorder limit . in terms of the correlation matrix , when @xmath95 is set at resonance ,",
    "this is equivalent to saying that contributions from localized wave functions in the momentum correlation matrix interfere destructively , because for every @xmath53 , @xmath122 is included , and this leads to a matrix that is approximately diagonal in momentum space .",
    "parallel to this , we note that there are single momentum entanglement modes at @xmath58 in all of the examples we present here ( see e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig_set18]b ) .",
    "although it is hard to see by eye in the figures we present here , closer inspection reveals that these @xmath58 modes depend on whether the number of occupied states is even or odd . to understand this behavior ,",
    "consider the weak disorder limit . in this case",
    ", the degenerate plane waves at @xmath53 and @xmath122 will hybridize easily and form the states @xmath123 which are split in energy by an amount that is linear in the disorder strength ( though the effective disorder strength vanishes if @xmath124 ) . now ,",
    "if the ground state only has one of these excitations occupied , say the state @xmath125 , then the momentum entanglement spectrum will automatically have a @xmath58 mode . however ,",
    "if the ground state has both states filled , then we obtain the factorized state @xmath126 , which has zero momentum entanglement . by successively filling the hybridized @xmath127 states",
    ", we will thus obtain a sequence of @xmath58 modes for an odd number of occupied states regardless of the scattering properties of the disorder potential .",
    "since the hybridization is immediate for the degenerate modes , even for extremely small disorder , they will appear as soon as the disorder is increased from zero .",
    "eventually , when the disorder is strong enough to make scattering between @xmath53-states at different energies play a more important role , such entanglement modes are obscured because of new entanglement modes entering from the edges near @xmath29 and @xmath30 to fill the region near @xmath58 .",
    "after our discussion of the effects of tuning @xmath95 we now turn to the description of the metal - insulator transition as the disorder strength @xmath80 is varied to tune the transition .",
    "we take the rdm as an example and set the fermi energy at its resonant value @xmath128 .",
    "[ fig_set18]a , f shows the momentum entanglement spectrum and entropy , respectively as a function of @xmath106 fig .",

    "a particular example of this type of transition is that which occurs between a topological insulator and trivial anderson insulator .",

    "the two simplest classes are the ones that only realize one of these symmetries : class d which satisfies exclusively particle - hole symmetry and class aiii which satisfies exclusively chiral symmetry ( hamiltonians with only time - reversal symmetry are all trivial in 1d ) .",
    "to simplify our discussion , we will focus on the latter .",
    "systems belonging to class aiii are those described by hamiltonians that anti - commute with an operator @xmath181 . the simplest such model in this class",
    "can be represented by a two - band model .",
    "systems with more bands can be adiabatically deformed so that the topological properties are determined by copies of such a two - band model .",

    "thus , in one subspace we have @xmath225 states where @xmath226 is the number of allowed momenta in the set @xmath223 $ ] , and in the other subspace we have @xmath227 remaining states where @xmath228 is the total number of lattice sites .    in the clean case ,",
    "the correlation matrix is block - diagonal in the momentum @xmath53 so the the entanglement spectrum is composed of the set entanglement modes @xmath229 at each @xmath53 where @xmath230 is @xmath231-fold degenerate and the non - trivial eigenvalue @xmath232 arises from the orbital cut at @xmath233 in fig . [ fig_cleanmomcut ] , we make a comparison between the spatial entanglement and the hybrid entanglement as a function of the mass parameter when the disorder is set to zero . in the hybrid entanglement",
    "there is a flow of entanglement modes between @xmath29 and @xmath30 when the system is topological as expected from eq .",
    "[ orbtent ] . in the trivial phase",
    "there is not a complete spectral flow as a function of @xmath233 this cut is not so revealing in the clean system as it just re - expresses eq .",
    "[ orbtent ] if we plot the entanglement spectra for the whole range of possible @xmath233    let us now add disorder to the system .",
    "we consider the aubry - andr potential first . in the sequence of plots shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_wdmom]a , we vary the disorder strength . for weak disorder",
    ", the entanglement spectrum largely retains the same structure we found in the clean system .",
    "as the disorder keeps increasing , and localization sets in , the momentum entanglement modes that were at @xmath30 and @xmath29 start to drift towards @xmath58 , signaling an increase in momentum entanglement .",
    "interestingly , the entanglement modes that traverse the entanglement gap are still present , and suggest that the system is still topological .",
    "this is corroborated with a calculation of the topological invariant , which is still quantized to @xmath202 at that disorder strength . finally ,",
    "when the disorder strength crosses the critical point , the momentum entanglement modes fill the gap . for comparison , and to illustrate the generality of our observations , we also show the the case of uncorrelated disorder , for one disorder configuration , in fig .",
    "[ fig_wdmom]b .",
    "it is nice to confirm that this type of entanglement can also be illustrative without disorder averaging .",
    "the overall behavior of the anderson transition for uncorrelated disorder matches what is observed for the transition in the aubry - andr potential for the topological insulator .",
    "from these observations , we find that there is a real sense in which the topological winding of the ground state is still encoded in the disordered system .",
    "even though the disorder induces scattering and tends to randomize the internal configuration of the single - particle states , the correlation between momentum and internal degree of freedom persists throughout the topological state .",
    "this manifests itself consistently as a spectral flow of orbital entanglement modes as a function of the momentum entanglement cut .",
    "the topological phase transition toward the trivial state eventually occurs when the scattering is strong enough that entanglement modes saturate @xmath58 , which we have identified throughout this work as leading to the trivial anderson insulator .",
    "it would be interesting to see how these results can be applied to higher - dimensional topological systems . in higher dimensions",
    "the scattering kinematics are much less constrained and it is not clear how well the topological information would be encoded in the momentum entanglement .",
    "however , here we see that we can capture the correlations between the momentum and the internal degrees of freedom which is a fundamental feature of free - fermion topological phases , so perhaps this tool will still be useful",
    ". it may also be useful to consider this type of hybrid cut for numerically identifying 1d interacting topological phases of fermions or even in spin - systems .",
    "in this work we have discussed the signatures in the entanglement of disordered fermions when they undergo anderson localization transitions .",
    "disordered metallic states in 1d that have suppressed scattering exhibit marked signatures in the momentum entanglement spectrum .",
    "delocalized states occur when momentum entanglement is suppressed and the anderson insulator is obtained when there is a saturation of momentum entanglement modes near @xmath58 .",
    "the momentum entanglement entropy is able to yield the disorder strength for which localization occurs , even in the presence of hubbard - type interactions .",
    "regarding disordered 1d topological states , we have found that the nontrivial nature of the ground state can be captured by performing an appropriate simultaneous entanglement cut in momentum and orbital space .",
    "this type of entanglement cut suggests that the ground state still has some correlation between the momentum and the orbital degree of freedom which manifests in the nontrivial topological boundary states of the system",
    ".    it would be interesting to further extend this study to higher - dimensional systems and with other symmetries . in 2d and in 3d there are interesting models that exhibit metal - insulator transitions as well as diverse nontrivial topological properties .",
    "consequently , one might encounter further interesting and useful features in the momentum entanglement that probe the quantum properties of the ground state . however , because of the much wider range of scattering kinematics , we expect that the extension of the pure momentum entanglement will be challenging .",
    "some work in this direction was carried out recently in ref .",
    "[ ] where indeed they find the higher - dimensional extension to be challenging .",
    "we would like to thank e. prodan and j. song for useful discussions , and the uiuc icmt for support .",
    "this work was supported by onr award n0014 - 12 - 1 - 0935 .",
    "in order to compute the localization length , we follow the calculation in terms of transfer matrices detailed in @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by first computing numerically the matrix @xmath116 given by    @xmath234^{1/2l}\\ ] ]    where the transfer matrix @xmath235 at the position @xmath69 and energy @xmath236 is given by @xmath237 the eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath116 which is closest to unity can be written as @xmath238 .",
    "finally , the exponent @xmath239 is the so - called lyapunov exponent which is related to the localization length by @xmath240 .",
    "we can obtain the polarization of a system of 1d fermions by computing the eigenvalues of the projected position operator @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the projection operator of the occupied states and @xmath243 is the position operator . in a finite system with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the position operator is written in the exponential form @xmath244 where @xmath245 are single - particle position basis states . using the set of eigenvalues @xmath246 of @xmath247 , the polarization",
    "is then given by @xmath248 which just measures the relative shift of the wannier centers with respect to the lattice sites ."
