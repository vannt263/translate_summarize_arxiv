    "large - area blind hi  surveys have come of age since the first 21-cm multibeam receiver was installed at parkes observatory in 1997 , to be followed by similarly powerful receiving systems at the lovell telescope , the arecibo telescope and the effelsberg telescope .",
    "these surveys have allowed extensive areas of sky to be mapped for extragalactic neutral hydrogen , resulting in the detection of over @xmath4 galaxies @xcite .",
    "surveys that specifically targeted the zone of avoidance expanded the sky coverage even further ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "prior to this , the most extensive neutral hydrogen surveys were those carried out with the single - beam or dual - beam systems at arecibo : the arecibo hi  strip survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ahiss ) the arecibo slice @xcite and the arecibo dual beam survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "these were all limited by the available bandpass to maximum recessional velocities of around 8000 kms@xmath5 ( z@xmath6 ) and had relatively slow mapping speeds compared to the more recent multibeam surveys .",
    "multibeam surveys have adopted the strategy of going wide rather than deep , since this generally results in the largest observed volume and the greatest number of detected objects .",
    "if a survey in the local universe is carried out with an integration time of 1 unit , then extending it to @xmath7 units by making it wider will increase the volume covered by a factor of @xmath7 , while extending it with a longer integration in the same area will increase the volume by a factor of @xmath8 , if not limited by receiver bandwidth and the changing beamsize with frequency is neglected .",
    "going very deep is generally only advantageous if it becomes possible to reach a new population of galaxies , e.g. outside the local region , or galaxies at an earlier epoch in their evolution .",
    "therefore , most survey time at parkes and lovell was spent on the relatively shallow hiparkes all sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hipass ) and the hi jodrell all sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hijass ) respectively .",
    "these surveys were limited by sensitivity ( as well as the available bandpass ) to maximum recessional velocities of less than 14000 kms@xmath5 ( z@xmath9 , even for the most massive systems .",
    "the deepest field survey carried out with the parkes system ( * ? ? ? * hideep ) reached a noise level of only 3.2 mjy ( at a velocity resolution of 18 km@xmath10 ) , considerably higher than ahiss ( 0.75 mjy at 18 kms@xmath5 ) .",
    "the most sensitive hi  surveys in the local universe are those pointed towards the cvn group @xcite and the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "observational programs on the newer arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) system at arecibo have followed a similar pattern with the largest surveys being devoted to large areas of sky . the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* alfalfa ) is covering 7000 deg@xmath11 to a noise level of 2.2 mjy ( at 10 kms@xmath5 ) and the arecibo galaxy environment survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ages ) is covering 200 deg@xmath11 to a noise level of 0.75 mjy ( at 10 kms@xmath5 ) .",
    "currently , the cornell hi  digital archive ( springob et al . 2005 ) , a homogeneous database of pointed hi  observations of about 9000 optically - selected galaxies , includes only a few objects with recessional velocities larger than 20,000 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "even the ongoing alfalfa and ages surveys mentioned above only reach maximum recessional velocities of 18,000 and 20,000 km  s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "however , in spite of challenges such as limited sensitivity and radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) , some progress in the detection of hiemission from galaxies at redshifts beyond @xmath12 has been made with deep integrations of galaxy clusters with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) @xcite , pointed arecibo observations of h@xmath13-emitting galaxies @xcite , and ` stacked ' giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) integrations of fields with existing redshift information @xcite .",
    "the parameters of these surveys are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : hisurveys ] .",
    "these observations have shown that it is possible to study the gaseous properties of galaxies in environments different to the local universe , and at look - back times of up to 24 gyr .",
    "nevertheless , selection effects , limited sensitivity , cosmic variance all conspire to make it challenging to obtain the accurate measurements required to quantify systematic evolutionary and environmental trends .",
    "the rate of conversion of gas into stars is one of the fundamental quantities that describe the evolution of galaxies and remains a difficult measurement to make for all but the most nearby galaxy populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at redshifts between zero and unity",
    ", the global co - moving star - formation rate appears to increase by a factor of five @xcite .",
    "molecular gas content possibly also increases over this redshift range @xcite .",
    "early models of the evolution of cold gas predicted a constant conversion factor between gas supply and star formation and therefore led to a similar strong evolution of the cold gas content @xcite .",
    "observations of local galaxies suggest that both hot and cold gas accretion significantly contribute to replenish the gas content of galaxies ( see e.g. review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the balance between the two might depend on redshift .",
    "the modern picture of a self - regulated equilibrium between the net inflow of gas and star formation leads to predictions of somewhat smaller evolution of the cold gas content at redshifts lower than two @xcite .",
    "this appears to fit observations of damped lyman-@xmath13 systems ( dlas , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which suggest that the redshift density of absorbers with @xmath14 @xmath15 increases only mildly , @xmath16 , which is consistent with constant co - moving gas density .",
    "conversion from dla measurements to a cosmic gas density @xmath17 is unfortunately fraught with uncertainty , largely due to the small number of observed systems , but also due to uncertain systematic effects such as lensing and covering factor .",
    "better measurements of the gas mass density from intermediate redshift dlas are presently not possible because of the limited availability of space - based uv instruments .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite compared local hi  observations with the dla number and argue that the number of galaxies found in their `` blind '' hi  surveys is consistent with the number densities of dlas at redshifts out to @xmath18 .    unfortunately , direct measurement of the hi  in emission at high redshift is difficult .",
    "bridging the gap between 21-cm surveys at z@xmath19 and dla surveys at high z , for example , to measure the cosmic hi  mass density , requires deeper and more extensive surveys in the 21-cm line than currently available . to be useful",
    ", such measurements ideally need to ( a ) have better accuracy than existing measurements ; ( b ) preferably not be tied to ` biased ' optical samples or galaxy overdensities ; ( c ) be over a large enough cosmic volume that cosmic variance is not a limitation ; ( d ) be at a significant redshift or look - back time ; and ( e ) sample the hi  mass function below the ` knee ' where the bulk of the gas may may locked up .",
    "unfortunately , achieving all of the above probably awaits the square kilometre array ( ska ) .",
    "however , many of the above goals can be partially achieved with a deep survey of a small field with the alfa instrument on the arecibo telescope .",
    "such a survey is currently in progress at arecibo .",
    "this `` arecibo ultra deep survey '' ( auds ) is the deepest blind survey ever carried out with the arecibo telescope , the world s largest single dish radio telescope .",
    "the full survey should allow the accurate measurements of the hi mass function up to the redshift limit of alfa of z@xmath20 , corresponding to a look - back time of about 2 gyrs or roughly 25% of the time between z@xmath21 and z@xmath22 . in this paper",
    ", we report on a precursor project for auds which tested our ability to achieve the very low noise levels required by the full survey .",
    "the goal of the auds is to carry out a blind 21-cm line survey at the highest redshift possible using the arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) . a fundamental requirement for the survey is the ability to survey a large volume to the highest practical redshift , which is given by the bandpass of the alfa receiver and is about z@xmath23 .",
    "sampling galaxies that contribute most of the gas mass to the hi  mass function at z@xmath22 requires sufficient sensitivity to detect some galaxies in the flat part of the luminosity function , i.e. galaxies down to at least @xmath24 m@xmath25 .    with a linewidth of 200 km  s@xmath5 ,",
    "a galaxy with @xmath26 m@xmath25 has an integrated flux of 0.03 jy km s@xmath5 and a mean flux density of only 140@xmath27jy at the far end of our redshift range .",
    "a sensitivity of 50@xmath27jy is necessary to detect such a galaxy with at least 3@xmath28 significance per channel .",
    "auds will use a total of 1200 hours of observing time to survey a total area of 1/3 square degrees with such a sensitivity .",
    "the integration time per pointing will be about 40 hours .",
    "this will be the longest integration time per pointing of any 21-cm survey ever conducted with the arecibo telescope .    before committing this large amount of observing time",
    ", we carried out precursor observations to test the feasibility of extremely deep surveys with the arecibo telescope .",
    "these precursor observations were carried out from october 2004 to february 2005 .",
    "the maximum redshift at which hi  line emission can be probed by auds is z@xmath29 and is set by the alfa multibeam receiver , which operates in the 1225@xmath301525 mhz frequency range .",
    "however , the lower end of such interval ( i.e. , frequencies below 1270 mhz , or z@xmath31 ) is heavily affected by rfi .",
    "thus we carefully chose a suitable target field with previously measured optical redshifts that would guarantee a few hi  detections across the whole redshift range and that would allow us to test our algorithms of signal extraction in presence of strong rfi .",
    "note that for this precursor survey an interim backend with a total bandwidth of 100 mhz was used .",
    "the redshift range from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , which will be sampled by the full survey , was therefore not accessible by the precursor survey .      to reach the deepest possible observations with the multibeam array alfa",
    ", we used a `` drift and chase '' mode to cover the survey region in a uniform manner .",
    "for that purpose , we rotated the feed array to an orientation so that a single position on the sky drifts through the three central beams .",
    "the basic strategy was to point 10 arcminutes ahead of the target field with the central beam , and then let the sky drift past for 100 seconds of time ( or 20 arcminutes ) .",
    "subsequently , the telescope drove back to the starting point and the whole procedure was repeated .",
    "the feed array remained stationary during each drift , and rotated to track the sky only between drifts .",
    "this strategy is ideal for arecibo because of its sensitivity to ground spillover . keeping the orientation and",
    "therefore the spillover constant during each drift results in the best possible baselines . at the same time , the `` on '' and `` off '' source integration are as close as possible in time and allow removal of temporal changes in receiver gain and interference .",
    "an additional advantage of drift scanning is that positions and fluxes of sources can be measured at the full telescope resolution at least in the scanning direction .",
    "the goal of the full auds will be to obtain fully sampled 2-d maps .",
    "this is achieved by introducing offsets of about 1/10th of the beam width between the individual drifts . however , to reach the highest possible sensitivity for the precursor observations , we repeated all our scans at exactly the same declination .",
    "the resultant sky coverage therefore consists of three disjoint strips , each of length 1500 arcseconds .",
    "this footprint is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : footprint ] .",
    "only a small part of the central strip is covered by three beams in each of the scans .",
    "as explained in the previous section , the deepest part of the survey was a strip with the extension in declination given by the size of the alfa beams , and about 13 arcminutes long in right ascension . to make the precursor observations a useful test of our ability to detect galaxies ,",
    "we have used the sdss dr2 @xcite spectroscopic data base to identify a target field with the following characteristics : ( a ) observable from arecibo during nighttime ; ( b ) including at least one hi - rich galaxy in the redshift range @xmath34 , corresponding to the relatively rfi - free 1270@xmath301300 mhz frequency window ; ( c ) including at least one hi - rich galaxy at lower redshift ; and ( d ) not contaminated by strong radio continuum sources . in practice , we generated a list of good candidates for hi  detection in the highest redshift end of our survey , and visually inspected the sdss images , looking for presence of additional disk galaxies within a few arcminutes from the main target .",
    "the selection criteria for _",
    "good _ hi  candidates are similar to those successfully used by @xcite to identify hi - rich galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( z@xmath35 ) detectable with arecibo .",
    "basically , we looked for relatively isolated , non - interacting galaxies with disk morphology , presence of h@xmath13  line emission , late - type spectra , and redshift as close as possible to our limit , z@xmath29 .",
    "the field selected for our precursor observations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : field ] .",
    "there are a total of 31 galaxies with measured redshift listed in the sdss dr7 @xcite .",
    "two of them are in the foreground of our survey at @xmath36 , 17 of them within our redshift range @xmath37 , and 14 in background at @xmath38 .",
    "there are more than one thousand additional sdss galaxies in the field without optical redshifts .",
    "the field includes several late - type galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "some of them are at or close to frequencies which are affected by rfi for a large fraction of the time .",
    "we used the _ wideband arecibo pulsar processors _ ( wapps ) with 100 mhz bandwidth and 4096 channels ( 3-level sampling ) .",
    "this resulted in a channel separation of 24.4 khz ( 5.2 kms@xmath5 at z@xmath39 ) .",
    "for this experiment , the wapps were tuned to a central frequency of 1275 mhz , giving coverage over the range 1325  1225 mhz ( corresponding to z@xmath40@xmath41 ) .",
    "we spent a total 53 one - hour sessions testing our `` drift - and - chase '' procedure on this target field . in the most sensitive part of the survey ,",
    "the accumulated integration time per pointing was about 14 hours .",
    "the total telescope time spent to carry out these observations was about 50% higher than the actual time spent on the drift scans . a significant fraction of these overheads was due to time losses at the start of each observing session and before and after each drift scan . for the full auds survey",
    ", overheads are expected to be about 25% since individual strips are longer .",
    "the measured rms in the spectra of the most sensitive part of the precursor survey is about 80@xmath42jy per 24.4 khz channel throughout the bandpass , see fig .",
    "[ fig : freq_rms ] .",
    "this is close to the expectations based on system temperature of 28k , gain of 9 k / jy , and the accumulated integration time per pointing of 14 hours . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] , we show the measured rms as a function of integration time at a frequency of 1270 mhz . it can be seen that the rms noise of the averaged spectra declined as @xmath43 down to the longest achieved integration time .",
    "data reduction was performed using the _ livedata _ and _ gridzilla _ multibeam processing packages .",
    "livedata _ performs bandpass estimation and removal , doppler corrects the data , and calibrates the resulting spectrum @xcite .",
    "the packages were modified by one of us ( mc ) to read arecibo data , and new routines to reject rfi were implemented .",
    "current versions of the _ livedata / gridzilla _ packages include these routines and are available at http://www.atnf.csiro.au/computing/software/livedata.html .",
    "the bandpass was calculated independently for each drift , beam , and polarization .",
    "a clipped median was used to compute a reliable calibration factor for each spectral channel in the presence of strong and persistent rfi .",
    ".[fig : rms ]    after the bandpass calibration , data points with rfi were flagged , both with an automatic procedure and manually ( see below ) . finally , flagged calibrated data",
    "were combined into a data cube using _",
    "gridzilla_. for the precursor experiment , the array configuration was optimized to provide depth rather than uniform coverage , with the beams forming three independent strips separated in declination . in order to grid this",
    "efficiently we chose a non - isotropic grid - size , with pixels 1 arcminutes in right ascension and 5.2 arcminutes in declination .",
    "this gave one row of pixels for each strip .",
    "the cube was formed by median - combining the data from the calibrated spectra , weighted so as to correctly reconstruct the flux of a source at the pixel center .",
    "the final data cube had a size of 45 pixels in right ascension , 3 pixels in declination , and 4096 spectral channels .",
    "all precursor data are impacted to some extent by rfi at various frequencies . in about 70% of all collected data ,",
    "rfi was limited to well known frequencies as listed in the observatory rfi catalog . in about 30% of the data , rfi at unusual frequencies",
    "occurred , sometimes wiping out large fractions of the bandpass .",
    "our strategy for removing rfi was twofold .",
    "first , we implemented an automatic rfi removal routine based on 3.5-sigma clipping of the data smoothed in time - frequency space .",
    "subsequently , we carefully edited out data sets with rfi not removed by our automatic procedure . the fraction of data rejected because of rfi as a function of frequency is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rfispectrum ] .",
    "it can be seen that rfi appeared at all observed frequencies during the observations . about 6% of the band",
    "is severely affected by rfi with 10% or more of the data points being flagged .",
    "this corresponds to about 8% of the sampled volume affected heavily by rfi .",
    "one concern for any deep survey are possible spurious detections of line emission caused by unrecognized rfi .",
    "such a situation is most likely to happen close to spikes in the rfi spectrum .",
    "for example , the detected sources 2 - 4 and 2 - 6 are close to rfi spikes ( see section [ sec : detection ] ) .",
    "we therefore re - examined this part of the spectrum and did not find any indication of undetected rfi .",
    "later , we found that 2 - 6 was also detected in the sdss at the exact redshift we determined from the hi  observations .",
    "this confirms our ability to detect lines even in spectral regions close to rfi spikes .",
    "to search for hi  emission lines in the final data cube , we created grayscale plots of the flux density as a function of right ascension and frequency for each of the three strips .",
    "each image was searched by eye for candidate hiemitters .",
    "examples of two such candidates are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : candidates ] . individual scans for each candidate were carefully inspected to minimize the probability of including spurious rfi into the candidate list .",
    "we found 18  detected hi  lines with a peak signal - to - noise ratio in the unsmoothed spectrum of at least 3 , and a total width of the line of at least 20 spectral channels .",
    "since the channels are mostly independent , the total signal - to - noise ratio of these lines is at least about @xmath44    we assigned a subjective quality code to each detected line , ranging from 1 for the best detections , to 3 for detections that can not be ruled out to be spurious .",
    "the criteria for the quality code were as follows .",
    "isolated , high signal - to - noise ratio lines were assigned a quality code 1 .",
    "any line spectra for which the uncertainties in the baseline were judged to be a significant fraction of the detected line were assignd a quality code of 3 .",
    "spectral lines in this category have low signal - to - noise ratios , large variations in the baseline and/or are uncomfortably close to rfi spikes .",
    "spectra for which such an assignment was difficult to make were assigned the quality code 2 .",
    "we suspect that several of the detected lines of the lowest quality are spurious , but note that the redshifts of two of them ( auds 2 - 4 and 3 - 1 ) were later confirmed by optical redshift measurements in the sdss .    for each detected line source",
    ", we extracted a total spectrum by summing up all adjacent spectra where flux at the corresponding redshift was detected with at least 3@xmath28 significance .",
    "the right ascension of the source was computed as the center of flux from the positions with line emission .",
    "the extracted spectra for all 18  detections sorted by increasing right ascension are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "each detected source is named @xmath45@xmath46 , where @xmath45 is the number of the strip 1 , 2 or 3 , and @xmath46 is a running number within the strip in order of increasing right ascension .",
    "[ fig : radec ] shows the distribution of the sources on the sky .",
    "each source is marked by an ellipse which indicates the uncertainty in the position for high signal - to - noise sources .",
    "the positional uncertainty is discussed in more detail in appendix  a.    -1truecm -1truecm      frequencies were converted to velocities using standard relations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "total hi  content was estimated from the integrated line flux using the standard relation    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the luminosity distance , and @xmath49 is measured optical velocity .",
    "the auds precursor geometry of three strips along constant declination leads to a substantial positional uncertainty for the detected galaxies which will not be present in the better sampled full survey .",
    "the sensitivity between two strips is only a few percent compared to the center of a strip , and the strips are largely independent .",
    "we estimate the listed right ascension to be accurate to about 1/5th the hpbw of the beam , i.e. about 40 arcseconds for high signal - to - noise detections in the central part of each strip .",
    "the position in declination is much less accurate , galaxies with large hi  masses can be detected even if they are located between the strips . in appendix",
    "a , the positional accuracy is discussed in more detail .",
    "our inability to locate the galaxies precisely causes a bias in the mass estimate which does not exist in better sampled maps .",
    "since the center of the beam is more sensitive than positions towards the edge , the positional uncertainty also leads to an uncertainty in the measured flux .",
    "hi  masses computed using the gain for the center of the beam are therefore in most cases an underestimate of the true mass .",

    "our model predicts that the probability that the detected galaxy is located that far from the center of the beam is less than 1% .",
    "the other five optical counterparts are on average at a distance of 0.66 arcmin from the center of their strip , and the average flux correction relative to the center of the strip is a factor of 1.15 .",

    "nevertheless , it is illustrative to compare the detection rate of galaxies to that expected from the local himass function .    for that purpose , we computed the hi  mass function from our sample using the standard 1/@xmath73 method @xcite .",
    "volumes were computed using the same gaussian approximation for the shape of the beam as in sec .",
    "[ sec : extract ] . for comparison",
    ", we also estimated the hi  mass function assuming a distribution function for the hi  flux and line width .",

    "the local hi  mass function determined from the hipass survey @xcite is shown as a solid line .",
    "it can be seen that the shape of the derived mass function is consistent with the hipass hi  mass function .",
    "we used a weighted fit to determine that the relative normalizations between the two hi  mass functions differ by a factor of 3.2@xmath75 .",
    "we then recomputed the hi  mass function after removing detections with the lowest quality rating .",
    "the normalization of the derived hi  mass function from this reduced sample is still a factor of 2.1@xmath76 higher than the local hi  mass function .",
    "we adopt the mean of the two factors and the mean relative error , @xmath77 , as our best estimate of the relative hi overdensity in the auds precursor region and its uncertainty .    for comparison , we estimated the relative density of sdss galaxies within the auds precursor survey volume .",
    "for that purpose , we extracted the sdss photometric redshifts for galaxies with @xmath71-band isophotal major axes between 5 and 40 arcsec .",
    "the selection on the major axes was imposed to eliminate galaxies with implausible photometric redshifts from the sample .",

    "the results presented below are insensitive to the exact range of selected isophotal major axes .",
    "there are 55 galaxies selected in that manner within the auds precursor survey volume .",
    "we tested the success of our selection procedure for the subsample of galaxies with available spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we found that all galaxies that are within the auds redshift range based on their spectroscopic redshift , are also correctly placed within that volume by their photometric redshift .",
    "there is only one galaxy which is placed within that volume by its photometric redshift even though the spectroscopic redshift is outside that range .",
    "the spectroscopic redshift of that galaxy is 0.1502 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the sdss photometric redshifts are accurate enough to estimate the relative densities of volumes in the auds redshift range .",
    "we then counted the number of galaxies selected in the same manner in 100 close - by regions of the same size and shape .",
    "we find that on average , there are @xmath78 galaxies in regions of that size , where 1.3 is the uncertainty of the mean based on the scatter in the number counts .",
    "the overdensity of sdss galaxies in the auds precursor region is therefore about @xmath79 , where the error estimate includes the poisson error on the number counts within the auds volume . assuming that the ratio between hi  density and that of sdss galaxies is independent of the local overdensity , we can estimate the mean hi  density at median redshift of the auds precursor survey in terms of the hi  density at zero redshift @xmath3 to be @xmath80    the error estimate includes only random errors .",
    "when we use the sdss spectroscopic redshifts to estimate the relative overdensity in the same manner as above , the result is @xmath81 the larger uncertainty is due to the smaller number of galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshift .",
    "we have used about 53 hours of integration time with the arecibo telescope to demonstrate the feasibility of high sensitivity hi  observations with the arecibo l - band feed array . to this depth",
    ", the noise in the final spectra still behaves as @xmath82 .",
    "rfi renders a significant fraction of the spectrum useless .",
    "however , regions of the spectrum where rfi is rarely present are little affected by the strong rfi in neighboring channels .    in total , we detected 18  hi  emitters in the survey . for six of them ,",
    "there are optical counterparts with measured redshifts in the sdss .",
    "for all other detections , there are plausible sdss counterparts without redshift confirmation .",
    "the detection rate is consistent with the total hi  density in the local universe .",
    "the experiment was a pilot study for the `` arecibo ultradeep survey '' .",
    "this survey will be more sensitive , cover more area on the sky with a better sampling , and probe a larger redshift range than this pilot study .",
