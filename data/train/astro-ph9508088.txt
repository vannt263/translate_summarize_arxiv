    "magnetic fields are universally present in astronomical bodies ranging from the earth to the distant quasars , but it is still unknown if magnetic fields permeate the universe as a whole .",
    "astrophysical magnetic fields may arise due to the existence of a primordial magnetic field that grows as galaxies form .",
    "the discovery of an extragalactic magnetic field on scales larger than virialized systems ( i.e. , larger than clusters of galaxies ) would reveal the presence of a primordial field .",
    "the existence of such a primordial field would help understand the origin of astrophysical magnetic fields and may open a new window into processes ocurring in the early universe .    in this letter",
    ", we show that the study of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhe crs ) with energies above @xmath0 can probe primordial fields below the current upper bound .",
    "our proposed method is complementary to traditional ones ( e.g. , kronberg 1994 ) and more recent suggestions ( e.g. , plaga 1995 ) . at present ,",
    "the most stringent constraint on large scale extragalactic fields comes from limits on the faraday rotation of light coming to us from distant quasars .",
    "the upper bound on a widespread , all - pervading field is @xmath3 gauss ( e.g. , kronberg 1994 ) .",
    "there are weaker constraints derived from the synchrotron emission from nearby galaxy clusters ( kim et al .",
    "1989 ) and the cosmic microwave background isotropy .",
    "uhe cr nucleons from extragalactic sources are attenuated in energy while propagating through the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . above a few @xmath4",
    ", nucleons produce pions on the cmb photons and the energy of the cosmic ray nucleons is degraded rapidly , which is known as the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect ( greisen 1966 ; zatsepin & kuzmin 1966 ) .",
    "produced pions , on the other hand , decay into secondary leptons such as electrons , muons , and neutrinos , and photons .",
    "since muons decay to electrons and neutrinos , the final secondary particles are photons , electrons , and neutrinos , among which photons are more readily detectable .    very energetic secondary photons and electrons couple to form an electromagnetic ( em ) cascade .",
    "the @xmath5-rays produce electron pairs on the cmb and the universal radio background photons ( see lee & sigl 1995 , lee 1995 and references therein for more detailed discussions ) .",
    "the resulting electrons ( or positrons ) in turn upscatter background photons via inverse compton scattering ( ics ) , thus completing a cycle .",
    "it is through these two processes that an em cascade develops in the intergalactic medium . as a result ,",
    "if one propagates a purely protonic spectrum , one gets a processed nucleon spectrum with the gzk cutoff , and a secondary em ( photons and electrons ) spectrum .",
    "the extragalactic magnetic field ( egmf ) influences the uhe cr flux mainly through their charged components , namely the primary hadrons and the secondary electrons . in the energy range under consideration",
    "the hadrons are deflected with negligible energy loss due to synchrotron radiation whereas the electrons are negligibly deflected before they lose most of their energy . in  2 , we explore the effect of the electron energy loss due to the egmf on the secondary em cascade spectrum .",
    "we then discuss the deflection of the hadronic component in the egmf , in  3 .",
    "finally in  4 , we summarize our findings .",
    "the egmf plays a crucial role in the development of the em cascade . in the presence of the magnetic field ,",
    "electrons lose energy via synchrotron radiation loss , which is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the strength of the large scale egmf , @xmath8 is the classical electron radius , and @xmath9 is the electron mass .    in fig .  1 , we show the rates of ics and synchrotron loss for electrons . whereas the rate of ics responsible for em cascade development decreases with energy , the synchrotron loss rate increases with energy .",
    "therefore , in a narrow energy range a transition occurs between a regime where ics is dominant and electrons couple to photons efficiently and another where electrons are rapidly lost due to synchrotron loss and the cascade is suppressed .",
    "below @xmath10 ( the threshold for pair production on the radio background ) , cascade development in the absence of an egmf would give rise to a generic power law photon spectrum with index @xmath11 .",
    "the above mentioned transition in the secondary -ray spectrum will therefore occur between this generic cascade shape and a synchrotron loss dominated spectrum . as long as synchrotron quanta can be neglected the latter is given by the photons produced `` directly '' by source injection or from pion production by nucleons , before undergoing pair production in the low energy photon background .    in a magnetic field of strength",
    "@xmath7 measured in g ( gauss ) the synchrotron spectrum produced by an electron of energy @xmath12 peaks at @xmath13 and falls off exponentially at higher energies . in the following",
    "we assume that the observable em flux is energetically dominated by -rays and electrons with energy @xmath14 .",
    "then , according to eq .  [",
    "[ synch ] ] , the contribution of synchrotron radiation to the -ray flux above @xmath15 can be safely neglected as long as @xmath16 everywhere .",
    "the energy where the transition in the -ray spectrum occurs is in general a function of the magnetic field strength and the background photon spectrum , but _ not _ a function of the source distance or the injection spectrum .",
    "if we consider only the cmb , the relation between the transition energy @xmath17 and the magnetic field strength is @xmath18 . in order to include the less well known diffuse extragalactic radio background into consideration",
    "we adopt its usual description by a power law with an overall amplitude and a lower frequency cutoff as parameters ( clark , brown , & alexander 1970 ) the latter one being the main source of uncertainty . using a cutoff at 2 mhz as suggested by clark et al .",
    "( 1970 ) the above relation is modified to @xmath19 for the same magnetic field a cutoff at lower frequencies would increase the rate of ics of the then more abundant low frequency radio photons and thus the value for @xmath17 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "assuming that the radio cutoff frequency lies somewhere in the range between 0.5 mhz and 3 mhz , for a given @xmath17 the egmf strength @xmath7 is uncertain within about a factor 5 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath20 it is possible to approximately determine the egmf strength by searching for a dip in the @xmath5-ray flux below @xmath21 which would mark a transition between an ics and a synchrotron loss dominated regime . for @xmath22 ,",
    "this transition occurs above the pair production threshold on the radio background where the @xmath5-ray flux increasingly depends on several unknown factors such as the charged cosmic ray flux above the gzk cutoff .",
    "thus , even though the @xmath5-ray flux can be comparable to the nucleon flux above @xmath21 , a discussion of possible magnetic field signatures in its spectrum would presently be too speculative .",
    "we developed a numerical code for the propagation of nucleons , photons , and electrons through the intergalactic medium which employs a transport equation formalism , the details of which can be found in lee ( 1995 ) .",
    "the observed uhe cr flux below @xmath21 ( see , e.g. , bird et al .",
    "1994 ; yoshida et al .",
    "1995 ) is reproduced quite well by a diffuse distribution of sources injecting protons with a spectrum @xmath23 up to some maximal energy considerably beyond the gzk cutoff ( yoshida & teshima 1993 ; sigl et al .",
    "for the calculations presented here we therefore adopted this proton injection spectrum with a maximal energy of @xmath24 ( see figures ) .",
    "the egmf enters the calculation via the synchrotron loss of electrons .",
    "the transition between ics and synchrotron loss domination can be easily seen in fig .  2 , which shows the processed nucleon and photon spectra for a single source at a distance of 30 mpc for a range of egmf strengths .",
    "in general , one expects a distribution of cosmic ray sources rather than a single source at a fixed distance . in fig .  3",
    ", we show the diffuse spectrum from a continuous source distribution extending up to 1 gpc .",
    "we assume a flat universe with zero cosmological constant and a hubble constant of @xmath25 km sec@xmath26mpc@xmath26 , and a comoving source density scaling as @xmath27 in redshift @xmath28 as in some `` bright phase '' models of cr sources ( e.g. , yoshida & teshima 1993 ; hill & schramm 1985 and references therein ) .",
    "the results are not very sensitive to these choices . in the diffuse case",
    ", the -ray to nucleon flux ratio tends to be smaller than for a single source , and the spectral features are not as pronounced , but still detectable for @xmath29 .",
    "the `` extragalactic magnetic field '' in this analysis refers to the average component of the egmf normal to the line of propagation .",
    "primordial magnetic fields are expected to have very little structure on scales below @xmath30 few mpc ( jedamzik , katalinic , & olinto 1995 ) , but condensed structures such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies can  polute \" the intergalactic medium with stronger magnetic fields on smaller scales .",
    "fortunately , the effect of the egmf on the @xmath5-ray spectral shape discussed here is most sensitive to the average field on large scales .",
    "when the em cascade goes through a strong field region , the electrons in the cascade lose energy rapidly and drop out of the uhe range .",
    "in contrast , the uhe nucleon and -ray fluxes are usually hardly affected directly by the radiation field of the intervening object ( stecker et al .",
    "1991 ; szabo & protheroe 1994 ; norman , melrose , & achterberg 1995 ) .",
    "after escaping the object , the cascade redevelops and the cascade spectrum recovers quickly at only a slightly smaller amplitude .",
    "the influence of intervening objects decreases with increasing strength of the large scale field and becomes important only when the objects are very close to the observer ( e.g. , less than @xmath31 away ) , or when their linear size is significant compared to the total propagation distance .",
    "we can derive conditions for the filling factors for such objects by requiring that they are much more sparsely populated along the line of sight to the source than the typical cascade regeneration length @xmath32 ( e.g. , @xmath33 5 mpc ) .",
    "for an average linear size @xmath34 of the intervening objects their filling factor @xmath35 must satisfy @xmath36 for field galaxies the above relation is @xmath37 , and for clusters of galaxies @xmath38 . the actual filling factors for galaxies , @xmath39 , and galaxy clusters , @xmath40 ( kolb & turner 1992 ; nichol , briel , & henry 1994 ) satisfy these constraints . therefore ,",
    "intervening objects do not modify the above discussion substantially .",
    "one interesting exception may be the effect of nearby large structures such as the virgo cluster .",
    "if virgo has strong magnetic fields , e.g.  of order @xmath41 on mpc scales , the uhe -ray flux from background sources might be modified across virgo s angular extension ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the ability of future detectors to study egmf features crucially depends on the -ray to nucleon flux ratio . for nearby strong sources",
    ", the secondary -ray flux could be measurable with instruments which are sensitive to ratios down to @xmath42 .",
    "this could be achieved by the proposed pierre auger project ( see e.g. , boratav et al .",
    "1992 ) , which would also allow an angular resolution of @xmath43 .",
    "the case of a diffuse source distribution is more challenging ; the @xmath5-ray flux is typically smaller and the egmf feature is less pronounced than for a single source at moderate distances ( see figs .  2 & 3 ) , but the dip in the @xmath5 spectrum may still be detectable .",
    "thus , measuring the -ray flux between @xmath0 and @xmath44 has the potential to either detect or find strong evidence against an egmf @xmath45 .",
    "here , we discuss the influence of the egmf on the charged uhe cr flux from discrete sources . we restrict ourselves to the case of small deflection angles ( for the opposite limit",
    "see , e.g. wdowczyk & wolfendale 1979 ; berezinskii , grigoreva , & dogel 1989 ) . in this case , the energy spectrum of charged uhe crs from a given source is not significantly altered as compared to a straight - line propagation . however , if the sources are strong enough to cause an anisotropy in the uhe cr flux , the directional correlation of  hot spots \" with possible sources will depend on the egmf .",
    "the following discussion relates to this anisotropic component of the charged uhe cr flux .    as in  2 ,",
    "let us assume that the large scale egmf can be characterized by a typical field strength @xmath7 and a coherence length @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , we assume for the moment that the source distance @xmath47 is smaller than the energy attenuation length @xmath48 for a charged cosmic ray of energy @xmath49 which can then be treated as approximately constant throughout propagation . for nucleons , @xmath50 mpc above the gzk cutoff ( at @xmath51 ) , and @xmath52 gpc much below the gzk cutoff .",
    "a more sophisticated analysis would require a monte carlo simulation of both uhe cr propagation and deflection .",
    "however , since data on both uhe cr and the egmf are so sparse to date , we feel that a qualitative discussion of the principle effects is more appropriate at the moment .",
    "we now consider two cases .",
    "\\(i ) the source distance is smaller than the coherence length , @xmath53 . then , in vectorial notation , the deflection angle @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the radius vector pointing to the source , @xmath57 is the charge of the uhe cr component , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "thus , a correlation between the uhe cr flux of charge @xmath57 and energy @xmath49 and source counterparts , systematically shifted by an angle @xmath54 , would indicate that @xmath60 and for a known source distance @xmath47 would allow to measure the combination @xmath61 .",
    "the characteristic @xmath49- and @xmath57 dependence of @xmath54 would provide an additional test for the hypothesis that the deflection is caused by an egmf .",
    "\\(ii ) the source distance is considerably larger than the coherence length , @xmath62 . in this case",
    "the deflection angle undergoes a diffusion process during propagation and the source shape in the uhe cr flux will be smeared out over a typical angle @xmath63 therefore , if sources appear spread out in the uhe cr flux of charge @xmath57 and energy @xmath49 by a typical angle @xmath64 , this would indicate that @xmath65 and for a known source distance @xmath47 would allow to measure the combination @xmath66 .",
    "if the source distance is larger than the energy attenuation length , @xmath67 , eqs .  [ [ def1 ] ] and [ [ def2 ] ] tend to overestimate @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , in the limit @xmath68 the deflection angle @xmath64  saturates \" as a function of @xmath47 and for approximately energy independent @xmath69 , @xmath47 has to be substituted by @xmath69 and @xmath70 in eqs .",
    "[ [ def1 ] ] and [ [ def2 ] ] , respectively .",
    "secondary -rays produced by the interactions of the charged uhe crs are also expected to correlate with the sources . due to their continuous production",
    "they will be smeared out over angles which are typically somewhat smaller than given in eqs .",
    "[ [ def1 ] ] and [ [ def2 ] ] .",
    "sources which can act as suitable probes for the egmf via the effects discussed above have to obey the following conditions apart from producing a detectable anisotropic uhe cr flux component : their apparent angular size should be smaller than the deflection angle @xmath64 .",
    "the same pertains to the apparent angular radius of a possible high magnetic field region around the source if it can cause deflections in excess of @xmath64 .",
    "for example , a @xmath71 field over a scale @xmath72 is possible in galaxy clusters ( see , e.g. , kronberg 1994 ) and would completely bend around a @xmath21 proton .",
    "however , as long as a detectable proton flux emerges from such an object and the above conditions are fulfilled , it could still be a suitable probe of the egmf .",
    "finally , there should be no intervening high magnetic field regions between source and observer which could cause bending by more than @xmath64 .",
    "for example , for @xmath73 , @xmath69 , this corresponds to the condition @xmath74 for linear scale @xmath75 and strength @xmath76 of the intervening field .",
    "this condition could well be satisfied along most lines of sight since known objects with high field regions like galaxies and galaxy clusters have a small filling factor @xmath77 .    in light of these conditions",
    "we believe that some of the nearby galaxy clusters and powerful field radio galaxies could well be suitable egmf probes since they are expected to contribute significantly to the uhe cr flux ( rachen , stanev , & biermann 1993 ) .",
    "the accuracy to which the egmf bending can be determined is limited by the ( to date ) unknown additional bending by the galactic magnetic field of strength @xmath78 and scale height @xmath79 .",
    "thus , according to eq .",
    "[ [ def1 ] ] , the sensitivity of deflection measurements of the egmf is restricted to field parameters satisfying @xmath80 where the fudge factors are the parameter values usually assumed for the galactic magnetic field .",
    "we discussed how composition , spectrum , and directional distribution of uhe cr above @xmath0 can be used to gain information about the large scale ( a few to tens of mpc ) egmf .",
    "spectral features in the @xmath5-ray flux are sensitive to field strengths in the range @xmath81 . in a similar range ,",
    "correlations between an anisotropic charged uhe cr flux component and possible sources could provide independent information on the egmf including its polarization .",
    "both effects should yield consistent estimates for the egmf strength .",
    "strong discrete sources detected in uhe crs by future instruments with an angular resolution of @xmath82 or better and a sensitivity to @xmath5-ray to nucleon flux ratios of @xmath83 or smaller would provide the best conditions for detecting an egmf in the range @xmath84 . since these conditions are not unreasonable , uhe crs have the potential to provide important information on properties and origin of the egmf .",
