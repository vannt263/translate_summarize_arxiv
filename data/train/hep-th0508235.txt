    "the importance of taub - nut solutions covers a wide area of application that extends from general relativity to string theory .",
    "these solutions @xcite are characterized by non - vanishing nut charges . as a result , they are locally asymptotically flat , i.e. , their boundaries are not @xmath3 but @xmath4 fiber over @xmath5 .",
    "these boundaries are topologically interesting since they do have a non - vanishing first chern number @xmath6 which is proportional to the nut charge . in these space - times",
    "one can not define a global time function , therefore , these manifolds can not be foliated using constant time surfaces and it is not possible to describe their time evolution through a unitary hamiltonian evolution .",
    "taub - nut spaces are also characterized by the existence of zero - dimensional fixed point set of the @xmath7 isometry generated by the time - like killing vector @xmath8 , which is called a nut .",
    "this is in contrast with the higher - dimensional fixed - point set appears in spherically symmetric black hole solutions , which is called a bolt .",
    "tau - nut solutions also possess a singular one dimensional string analogous to dirac string @xcitewhich is called misner string .",
    "the singularity of misner string is a coordinate singularity , since one fails to describe the manifold using a single coordinate system .",
    "misner string contributes to the entropy of the black hole , therefore the entropy is not simply one quarter the area of the horizon .",
    "this is a very interesting property in gravitation , which reveals some features of the geometric entropy and has been studied by hawking and hunter @xcite .",
    "another attractive feature of the taub - nut solution is the celebrated gross - perry - sorkin monopole@xcite .",
    "this monopole can be constructed by adding another trivial dimension to get a five dimensional metric followed by kaluza klein compactifing the theory to four - dimensional along the euclidian time direction . as a result",
    ", one gets a singular four - dimensional monopole solution .",
    "this shows how perfectly regular higher dimensional solutions can give rise to a singular lower dimensional one .",
    "taub - nut solution plays an important role in revealing the nature of d6-branes in type iia string theory and its relation to m - theory(for a review see _",
    "e.g._@xcite ) .",
    "probing the background geometry of n coincident d6-branes using d2-branes shows that the transverse dimensions to both branes are not three , but in fact four dimensions and the metric is the taub - nut metric .",
    "the extra dimension is the euclidian time direction which is compact .",
    "it comes from the gauge degrees of freedom of the @xmath7 gauge theory living on the d2-brane world - volume .",
    "this shows that the d6-brane is a kaluza - klein monopole from the m - theory prospective .",
    "another interesting application of nut charged space - times is to extend and test the validity of the ads / cft correspondence to locally asymptotically ads solutions , and study their thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to find new taub - nut and taub- bolt solutions in higher dimensions with an eye on possible applications of these results in various supergravity / string theories . here",
    "we present a class of higher dimensional @xmath7 electrically charged solutions with nut charge , which are generalizations to the solutions found in @xcite ( see also @xcite for discussions on their thermodynamics ) .",
    "the action for einstein - maxwell theory in @xmath0dimensions for asymptotically ( anti)de  sitter space - times is    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the cosmological constant , @xmath11 is newton s constant in @xmath0dimensions , and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the vector potential .",
    "varying the action with respect to the metric and the vector field @xmath13 we get the following field equations g_-g_&=&2 t _ , + _",

    "the general form of the taub - nut / bolt metric is given by ds^2=f(r)^-1dr^2+(r^2-n^2)d_b^2+f(r)(d+a)^2where the metric @xmath20 is over an even dimensional einstein - khler manifold @xmath21 , @xmath22 is some function of @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath15 is called the `` nut charge '' and @xmath24 is the potential of the khler form @xmath25 = d a    the hypersurface defined by @xmath26 is a @xmath7 fiber over the base manifold @xmath21 .",
    "the base space @xmath21 can be any even dimensional einstein - khler manifold .",
    "the case when @xmath27 is special , since the solution obtained is a non - singular space .",
    "any other base space will be singular and therefore it can not be considered as a gravitational instanton .",
    "on the other hand these solutions are fine when they describe bolt solutions , since these singularities will be hidden behind horizons . in the @xmath28 case",
    "the resulting hypersurfaces are squashed @xmath29 and @xmath15 here measures the amount of squashing .    in order to generalize this construction by giving electric charges to these solutions",
    ", we need some ansatz for the one - form potential @xmath30 .",
    "we are going to adopt the following ansatz for the potential a = g(r)(d+a ) the general solution for @xmath31 depends on two parameters , one is the electric charge , @xmath1 and the other is @xmath2 , which can be viewed as potential at infinity ; as @xmath32 we have a=(q / r^d-3+v)(d+a ) .",
    "@xmath2 plays an important role in studying the thermodynamics of riessner - nordstrom ( a)ds solutions as has been revealed in @xcite . requiring regularity of the one - form potential @xmath30 at the horizon",
    "relates the two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "in fact we will not discuss the de  sitter versions of these solutions , but they can be obtained , simply by taking @xmath33 which will be left for future work . while writing this article",
    "the work of @xcite has been posted .",
    "the authors of @xcite discuss similar solutions to the one presented here , but one can spot two general differences ; i ) the solutions presented here are a bit more general since it has two extra parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 , ii ) here we also discussed the conditions of having taub - nut or taub - bolt solutions and we have showed the possibility of having a taub - nut for certain values of the mass parameter and @xmath2 . this article is organized as follows ; in the first section we discuss conditions for obtaining nut and bolt solutions for asymptotically locally flat or locally ads space - times in four dimensions . in the following section we present our results in six dimensions which can be generalized to eight and ten dimensions for asymptotically flat or ads space - times .",
    "finally we put some final remarks on the relevance of these solutions .",
    "the first electrically charged four - dimensional taub - nut solution has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "more general versions of this solution have been studied in e.g. , @xcite .",
    "their supersymmetry has been discussed in @xcite , where the authors have showed that these solutions do preserve some supersymmetry for certain choices of their parameters . here",
    "we present an ( a)ds version of this solution with the additional parameter , v , that we mentioned in the introduction . the charged taub - nut ( anti)-de - sitter space version of the brill s solution has the form ds^2=f(r)(d-2nd)^2+dr^2",

    ", we must have @xmath38 , so that all of the extra dimensions collapse to zero size at the fixed - point set of the killing vector , @xmath8 .",

    "amusingly the last condition , i.e. , @xmath40 can be obtained from requiring the regularity of the one - form @xmath30 at the horizon as well .",

    "this implies that = 8n    notice that the value of the mass parameter that produces the nut in the charged case is identical to that of the uncharged case .",
    "furthermore the stress - energy tensor vanishes upon satisfying the above conditions . as a result",
    "the metrics for the two cases in four - dimensions are the identical",
    ". it will be clear from the discussion below that this is not the case for higher dimensional solutions . in higher dimensions",
    "the mass parameter of the charged case will depend on both the nut charge and the electric charge .",
    "this is a new feature that makes higher dimensional charged nut solutions more richer and possess one more parameter , namely @xmath1/or @xmath2 , as it is clear from curvature tensor calculation .",
    "another feature which is unique to the four - dimensional solution is that the existence of the additional parameter @xmath2 together with the nut charge induces a magnetic charge and changes electric charge as well even at large radius .",

    "the magnetic monopole appears as a result of the non - trivial fibration .",
    "also in this limit the electric charge will be only @xmath1 .",
    "this shows that the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not convenient for the four - dimensional solution and they should be replaced by @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the total electric charge and the magnetic charge of the solution as in @xcite , which shows that this solution is a dyon .",
    "this phenomenon does not happen in higher dimensions , i.e. the @xmath1 will be the total electric charge up to some numerical factor without any contribution from @xmath2 , but it is clear from the electric field calculation that there is a linear charge density term as well which is proportional to @xmath48 . as a result",

    "in addition to these requirements we have another regularity requirement , namely ; regularity of the one - form potential @xmath30 at the bolt @xmath53 .",
