    "hard reactions provide important information for unveiling the structure of hadrons .",
    "the large virtuality , @xmath0 , involved in these processes allows the factorization of the hard ( perturbative ) and soft ( non - perturbative ) contributions in their amplitudes .",
    "therefore these reactions are receiving great attention by the hadronic physics community . among the hard processes ,",
    "the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) merits to be singled out , because it can be expressed , in the asymptotic regime , in terms of the so called generalized parton distributions ( gpds )  @xcite .",
    "the gpds describe non - forward matrix elements of light - cone operators and therefore measure the response of the internal structure of the hadrons to the probes  @xcite .",
    "there is much effort under way related to the measurement of these functions .    due to the impossibility at present to determine the gpds from quantum chromodynamics directly ,",
    "models have been used to provide estimates which should serve to guide future experiments  @xcite .",
    "the aim of our work is to perform such a calculation in a field theoretic scheme which treats the bound - state in a fully covariant manner following the bethe - salpeter approach . in this way",
    "we would like to preserve all invariances of the problem .",
    "for simplicity we shall use mesons as initial and final states .",
    "we define a scheme , to calculate the electro - magnetic interaction of hadrons , which separates the soft parts , where we use a non perturbative treatment , and the hard parts , where the conventional perturbative treatment is applied .",
    "the scheme preserves gauge invariance to leading order and leading twist .    in order to describe the soft part",
    "we start by using as a test of our ideas a model based on the @xmath1 field theory .",
    "this theory has the advantage of being renormalizable and therefore any contribution can be analyzed properly .",
    "we show , for example , that a correction to the hand bag contribution to first order in the strong coupling constant , which goes beyond our scheme , vanishes .",
    "we next proceed to the main development of this paper , namely to perform the study of the gpds of the pion by using the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model to describe its structure .",
    "the njl model is not a toy model .",
    "in fact , it is the most realistic model for the pion based on a quantum field theory built with quarks .",
    "it gives a good description of the low energy physics of the pion and respects the realization of chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "moreover it has been used as the model to tune many coefficients of chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the njl model is a non renormalizable field theory and therefore a cut - off procedure has to be defined .",
    "we have chosen the pauli - villars regularization procedure because it respects all the symmetries of the problem . in our scheme ,",
    "we use the njl model to describe the soft ( non perturbative ) part of the process , i.e. the initial and final states , while for the hard part we use conventional perturbative qcd .",
    "the use of the njl model allows to calculate the gpds for massive pions .",
    "some peculiarities , as the non vanishing of the gpds at the kinematic boundary regions , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , well known in the exact @xmath4 limit , survive when @xmath5 .",

    "ii we give some general definitions for scalar partons and we introduce our kinematical variables . in section iii and iv we will define our approach for the scalar and the njl model respectively .",

    "the gpds are non - diagonal matrix elements of bi - local field operators .",
    "various conventions , reference frames , variables , etc . , have been used in the literature for the description of such objects .",
    "our notation is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , i.e. , the initial momentum is labeled by @xmath6 , the final momentum by @xmath7 , and the momentum transfer is given by @xmath8 .",

    "the gpd of a scalar system is defined by the matrix elements of bi - local scalar field operators  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the conventional bjorken variable , @xmath11 the so - called skewedness parameter , and @xmath12 .",
    "the elastic electromagnetic form factor of a system composed of two scalar particles is given by : @xmath13 it follows directly from these definitions that integrating the gpd over @xmath10 gives the form factor , @xmath14 where the dependence on the skewedness parameter @xmath11 drops out .",
    "this result is an important constraint for any model calculation .     for the gpds .",

    "we begin our study with the simplest model which allows for a completely analytic solution of the bethe - salpeter equation : this model describes a bound state of two distinguishable equal - mass scalar particles bound together by a zero - range interaction . for later convenience ,",

    "its main advantage lies in its simplicity , the fact that one may obtain analytic solutions , avoiding approximations that might destroy physical requirements or symmetries , like lorentz- or gauge invariance , sum rules , etc . moreover it has the added advantage that it is defined within a renormalizable quantum field theory .",
    "these properties make it a useful playground to perform benchmark calculations , as it was used recently in order to test the viability of certain relativistic quantum mechanics approaches  @xcite .",
