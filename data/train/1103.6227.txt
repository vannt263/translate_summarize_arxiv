    "the herschel space observatory ( hereafter hso or simply herschel ) is a far - infrared and submillimetre observatory of the european space agency ( esa ) , successfully launched on may 14 , 2009 @xcite .",
    "herschel orbits the second lagrangian point of the sun  earth system , that is apparently on the direction opposite to the sun .",
    "the mean height of the orbit is approximately @xmath2million kms , while the semi - amplitude of the actual motion is about the half of this value .",
    "hso is equipped with three on - board scientific instruments : the photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the herschel - heterodyne instrument for the far - infrared ( hifi , * ? ? ?",
    "herschel observes a typical target from a dozen of minutes up to several hours .",
    "the list of observed targets , the utilized instruments and other information can be found on the public web page of hso .",
    "since the solar panels and other stuff mounted on the exterior of the spacecraft reflects the sunlight efficiently , one can expect a considerably good detectability of the spacecraft .",
    "however , due to the sharp terminations of ( some of ) the external devices ( see any photographs of models of the observatory itself ) , the amount of reflected light starkly depends on the spatial orientation of the spacecraft . indeed , the apparent visual brightness of the spacecraft can vary in a range of several magnitudes , yielding all values from the complete non - detection up to @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , as we highlight in this draft , the observed brightness is extremely sensitive to the orientation : even a slew of few degrees can reduce or increase the flux coming from the spacecraft by a factor of two or three .",
    "here we summarize our astrometric and photometric observations of the spacecraft that confirms the expectations discussed above .",
    "our main conclusion is that the observed brightnesses significantly correlates the orientation and these brightness variations due to the slew of the telescope are not `` monotonic '' .",
    "the structure of this draft is as follows .",
    "section  2 describes the observations , section  3 summarizes the methods used in the data reductions while section  4 discusses the results .",
    "since apparently hso moves relatively fast , planning of the observations should be done carefully .",
    "the observatory itself is relatively faint so longer exposure times are needed for a good astrometry and/or photometry , however , the apparent proper motion of the spacecraft limits the exposure times . actually , one can compute an `` optimal '' exposure time by comparing the instrumental fwhm with the proper motion and let this point source move by a certain fraction ( e.g. the half or little more ) of the fwhm .",
    "we carried out the photometric and astrometric observations of hso using the the 60/90/180 cm schmidt telescope of the konkoly observatory , located at the piszkstet mountain station on the night of february 7 , 2011 .",
    "the telescope is equipped with an apogee alta - u @xmath4 ccd camera , yielding a square - shaped field - of - view with a size of @xmath5degrees .",
    "the typical effective fwhm for this setup is between @xmath6 arcseconds , depending on the current seeing .",
    "according to the predictions made available by minor planet center ( mpc ) , the expected proper motion of herschel was between @xmath7 and @xmath8 arcseconds per minute , therefore we concluded to use an exposure time of 60 seconds .",
    "the observations covered the time range between 18:43 ut and 01:21 ut ( on february 8) , with small gaps . all in all we gathered @xmath9 good quality scientific frames . in order to obtain the highest signal - to - noise ratio",
    ", we did not use any specific filter for the observations .",
    "this is a common practice for the astrometry ( and sometimes photometry ) of small bodies in the solar system and due to the spectral responsivity of the employed ccd detector , such data can be interpreted as some sort of wide r measurements .",
    "the expected total proper motion of the object was less than 20 arcminutes , so due to the large field - of - view of the telescope and camera , no manual tracking was needed during the observations .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]",
    "following the standard calibration procedures ( subtraction of averaged dark frames and corrections using flat field images ) , the reductions of the data were done as follows .",
    "individual stellar profiles has been searched using the ` fistar ` utility of the software package described in @xcite .",
    "these lists of detected stars has been used to perform both relative and absolute astrometry on the images .",
    "the relative ( or differential ) astrometry was done with respect to a selected frame from the middle of the observation series ( namely , the 130st out of the 263 frames ) while the absolute astrometry was done using the usno - b1.0 catalogue ( that is also commonly used in the practice of the astrometry of minor bodies in the solar system ) .",
    "the tasks of astrometry has been done by the ` grmatch ` and ` grtrans ` utilities .",
    "both the relative and absolute astrometry were done using a third - order polynomial fit , that has been found to be sufficient ( since the unbiased fit residuals did not decrease if the orders were increased ) .",
    "the images have then been registered ( using the task ` fitrans ` ) to the reference frame using the results yielded by the differential astrometry .",
    "following the registration of the images , the flux levels of the images have also been scaled linearly to the same level .",
    "this was done by selecting several comparison stars and performing aperture photometry on these ( involving the task ` fiphot ` ) .",
    "the mean of the aperture backgrounds have been subtracted from the respective images ( yielding a zero mean background level ) while the instrumental fluxes has been scaled appropriately to the flux level of the reference image ( that was , in practice , the same as the one used as an astrometric reference ) .",
    "a master reference image was then built ( employing the program ` ficombine ` ) , from every tenth of the individually registered and scaled images by taking the per - pixel median of these .",
    "herschel itself was then searched by eye on @xmath10 frames ( i.e. 3 subsequent images in 7 groups , spreading almost homogeneously through the whole observation ) . using these coordinates as a hint for astrometry ,",
    "the task ` fiphot ` was used to refine the pixel coordinates and then a third - order polynomial has been fitted to both the @xmath11 and @xmath12 coordinates as the function of the time . we found that fitting a third order polynomial was sufficient at a certain level (",
    "i.e. the residuals were not larger than few tenths of a pixel ) and this polynomial was used to interpolate the current position of the hso between the frames were it was marginally or absolutely not detected .",
    "this interpolated coordinates have been exploited as a hint for a subsequent centroid determination ( using the task ` fiphot ` ) .",
    "these refined centroid coordinates were then used as a photometric centroid , on which the actual aperture photometry was performed . in order to avoid the effect of nearby stars ( that were crossed by herschel apparently ) , this process has been done on differential images ( i.e. the master reference image has been subtracted from each registered and scaled image before astrometry and photometry ) .      to have an accurate photometry , all of the nicely detected stars on the master reference image has been measured similarly ( with the same aperture size as for herschel ) and using the cross - match lists from the absolute astrometry , we were able do determine the shift between the standard ( usno ) and the instrumental magnitudes .",
    "although this step sounds a bit optimistic ( i.e. the flux levels derived from a ccd image without any filter has been adjusted to a photographic reference catalogue with a given filter and we neglect the effects of the color - dependent extinction ) , we found that the residual of this fit is not larger than @xmath13 . on",
    "can see the resulted light curve on fig .",
    "[ fig : hsolightcurve ] . image stamps showing herschel itself on some of its brightest phases can be seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : hsobrightest ] , while the results of astrometry and photometry in the format of mpc are displayed on table  [ table : sample ] .",
    "in this draft some photometric and astrometric measurements for the herschel space observatory have been presented . as it was discussed here , taking accurate photometry of hso has some difficulties due to the fast apparent proper motion .",
    "anyway , the presented photometric results confirm that the brightness variations of hso ( yielded by the telescope slews ) is in accordance with the observation logs , and  and this is really reassuring .",
    "the author would thank jnos kelemen for the discussions and gathering the observations and krisztin srneczky for useful advises .",
    "the scientific work of the author related to the herschel mission has been supported by the esa grant pecs  98073 and in part by the jnos bolyai research scholarship of the hungarian academy of sciences ."
