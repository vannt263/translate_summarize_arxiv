    "in ref .  @xcite  through comparison with the synchronization patterns arising in two - dimensional arrays of fitzhugh  nagumo ( fhn ) elements with _ phase - repulsive _ linear nearest - neighbor coupling  the authors were able to conclude that _ intracellular _ calcium oscillations in cultures of human epileptic astrocytes _ do _ interact , since the phases of nearby oscillating astrocytes maintain a nontrivial relationship .",
    "it is a fortunate fact that the ( space - independent ) fhn model is one of the very few multicomponent systems for which a _ nonequilibrium potential _ ( nep ) has been found @xcite , since neps allow in general for a deep insight on the dynamical mechanisms leading to pattern formation and other phenomena where fluctuations play a constructive role @xcite .",
    "the ( albeit minimal ) extension of the result in refs .",
    "@xcite towards extended systems carried out in this work is however enough to shed light on the dynamical cause of the conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite : a dynamical symmetry breakdown takes place because the phase - repulsive coupling minimizes the corresponding nep .",
    "when the system is externally forced with a frequency less than the typical inverse deterministic time the cycle duplicates , breaking down into an `` excited '' phase and an `` inhibited '' one .",
    "these phases force neighbor elements to alternate with the one in between , thus creating a nontrivial phase relationship between nearby oscillating elements .",
    "the system we consider is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] : a ring of @xmath1 identical fhn elements with _ phase - repulsive _ nearest - neighbor coupling and submitted to a ( subthreshold ) common oscillatory signal and independent gaussian white noises @xmath2 , @xmath3 with @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "[ fig:1 ]    the set of equations governing its dynamics is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ratio between the relaxation rates of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a suitable constant to set the rest point in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a .",
    "@xmath13 is the _ phase - repulsive _ coupling constant , and the @xmath14 ( which determine the transport matrix ) are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 . moreover , taking the milshtein integration step as @xmath19 , we estimate the typical inverse deterministic time as @xmath20 and so we take the excitation frequency @xmath21 as a fraction of that value ( typically 0.10.4 ) . given that , @xmath22 .",
    "[ fig:2 ]    [ fig:3 ]    [ fig:4 ]    excitable dynamics can be conceptually decomposed into two phases , a _ fluctuation - dominated _ one and a _ deterministic _ one",
    ". it would be highly desirable to find a lyapunov function , since it greatly simplifies the dynamical analysis . however , the existence of non - variational ( or conserving ) components in the phase - space flow is a hint that the integrability conditions fail for the purely deterministic system .",
    "this apparently insurmountable drawback was partially solved two decades ago by graham and collaborators ( see references in @xcite ) who defined the nep for langevin - type dynamics as the zero - noise limit of the logarithm of the _ stationary _ probability density function ( pdf ) .",
    "the extra freedom in the choice of the transport matrix can render in some cases the problem integrable .",
    "that is precisely the case for the space - independent fitzhugh  nagumo model in its bistable and excitable regimes @xcite .",
    "this approach can be generalized to extended systems and the nep associated to eq.([eq : fhn ] ) ( in the adiabatic limit , i.e.  for slow signal ) is @xcite @xmath23 + 2d\\frac{u_iu_{i+1}}{\\lambda_1}\\right\\},\\label{eq : phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which must obey the integrability condition @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:2]b depicts ( in full line ) the time evolution of the nep during the phase - space excursion starting at the upper initial condition in fig .  [ fig:2]a , together with that of @xmath25 ( dashed line ) and @xmath26 ( dotted line ) .",
    "we remark that in figs .  [ fig:2]a and [ fig:2]b",
    "there is no noise and @xmath27 is the lyapunov functional of the deterministic dynamics .",
    "figures [ fig:3]a and [ fig:3]b ( respectively [ fig:4]a and [ fig:4]b ) are 3d and contour plots of the nep and the corresponding stationary pdf for the excitable ( respectively bistable ) regime .",
    "[ fig:5 ]    synchronization between the coupled system and the external signal is observed above some noise - intensity threshold .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] is a plot of the time evolution of @xmath8 ( full line ) , together with that of @xmath28 ( dashed line ) for a given neuron @xmath29 , showing their phase relation to the signal ( dotted line ) according to fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we may call `` active '' those cells @xmath29 for which @xmath30 exceeds some threshold value @xmath31 .",
    "because of the coupling , as one neuron becomes active , it inhibits the activation of its nearest neighbors .",
    "the perfect alternance seen in the figure may fail because of the noise , a necessary ingredient for the activation .",
    "a detail of the alternance can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] for an @xmath32 subset of the ring .",
    "figure [ fig:6]a shows a situation ( snapshot ) of poor synchronization , in which only two neurons are active ; fig .  [ fig:6]b exhibits a case of a `` kink '' in the synchronized configuration , induced by the fact that noises are local .",
    "note that the kinks break locally the observed coherence , and the complete history of the time evolution can be followed as a record of activity ( see fig .  [ fig:7 ] ) .",

    "[ fig:8]b we show the nep for the whole ring as a function of time , together with the ( scaled ) signal for reference .",
    "we remark that the observed dynamical symmetry breakdown decreases the lyapunov function of the whole ring with respect to that of the homogeneous state , providing the route to stable synchronization .",
    "a global estimator of synchronization can be defined as @xmath36 figure [ fig:9]a is a plot of @xmath37 as a function of the noise intensity . the existence of a threshold value of noise intensity and of a saturation effect can be clearly seen .",
    "the noise intensities are low enough not to degrade the excitable dynamics .",
    "[ fig:8 ]    numerical simulations indicate that the coherence of firing decreases with the noise intensity although the global activity ( representative of global estimators ) keeps the order of magnitude . to quantify this phenomena",
    "we have calculated the normalized self - correlation @xmath38 as a function of the noise intensity @xmath39 . as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:9]b the system shows a kind of `` stochastic resonance in coherence '' that can not be inferred from measures of global activity .",
    "we have investigated the noise - induced synchronization with an external signal of a ring of phase - repulsively coupled fhn elements .",
    "we have derived the exact nep of the extended system and the observed symmetry breakdown was related with the lyapunov - functional properties of the nep .",
    "we remark that the same conclusion holds qualitatively for the work in ref .  @xcite .",
