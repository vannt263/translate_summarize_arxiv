    "owing to the impressive progress in experimental techniques , ultracold neutral atoms trapped in optical lattices are nowadays widely recognized as a versatile toolbox bringing into reality ideal models of condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "a prominent example in this respect is no doubt the bose - hubbard model , originally introduced to sketch the physics of superfluid helium in porous media @xcite and subsequently shown to be realizable in terms of optically trapped ultracold bosonic atoms @xcite .",
    "this model , describing interacting bosonic particles hopping across the @xmath0 sites of a discrete structure , is characterized by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are on - site bosonic operators , @xmath6 measures the strength of the ( on - site ) boson - boson interaction , @xmath7 is the hopping amplitude across neighboring sites and @xmath8 is the so - called adjacency matrix , describing the lattice topology .",
    "its generic entry , @xmath9 , equals 1 if the sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 are adjacent , and 0 otherwise .",
    "parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are directly related to well defined experimental quantities , i.e. the scattering length of the bosonic atoms and the intensity of the laser beams giving rise to the optical lattice , respectively @xcite . the possibility of tuning the lattice strength over a wide range of values played a fundamental role in the experimental observation @xcite of the superfluid - insulator quantum phase transition predicted for hamiltonian ( [ e : bhh ] ) in the case of repulsive interaction @xcite .",
    "further aspects of versatility of optically trapped ultracold atoms lie in the possibility of tuning the atomic scattering length , and hence the boson - boson interaction , via feshbach resonances @xcite and realizing a great variety of different lattices , by means of a suitable laser beam setup @xcite , possibly involving holographic elements @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the case of attractive bosons in a 1d periodic lattice , whose experimental realizability is made concrete by a recently proposed optical trapping scheme @xcite and by the control over the sign and intensity of the boson - boson interaction granted by feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "this symmetric , _ necklace - like _ geometry is particularly interesting since , in the strong interaction limit , the system ground state is a quantum superposition of macroscopic spatially localized states , i.e. a so - called _ schrdinger - cat _",
    "state @xcite .",
    "although the state - of - art experimental setups ensure a remarkable control and insulation from the environment , the realization of such deeply quantum states presents several difficulties , which will be briefly discussed in the final part of this work .",
    "our main aim here is a study of the ground state properties of quantum hamiltonian ( [ e : bhh ] ) , which we compare to the corresponding state of a suitable semiclassical approximation to the bose - hubbard model .    before going into details , we mention that the attractive bose - hubbard model has been addressed by two recent works @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a further nonlinear ( cubic ) repulsive term is introduced in hamiltonian ( [ e : bhh ] ) in order to prevent excessive localization for large values of the interaction .",
    "such a term is ascribed to three body interactions coming into play at elevate atomic densities . however , experimental observations suggest that these interactions produce different phenomena resulting into a leak of condensate atoms rather than into a repulsive term @xcite",
    ". hence , here we do not consider such a repulsive term , and assume that the total boson population is sufficiently low to rule out the above phenomena . in some respects",
    "our analysis is similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , whose results we compare to ours .",
    "other recent results related to ours are found in refs .",
    "@xcite , which also focus on annular geometries , yet in the absence of a lattice potential . finally , we mention that the attractive bose - hubbard model  ( [ e : bhh ] ) has received considerable attention as the quantum counterpart of the discrete self - trapping ( dst ) or quantum discrete non - linear schrdinger ( dnls ) equations @xcite , particularly in relation to the issues of discrete quantum solitons @xcite and breathers @xcite .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section [ s : quantum ]",
    "we rapidly review the key features of the bose - hubbard model ( [ e : bhh ] ) . focusing on the special case of a periodic one - dimensional lattice comprising @xmath0 sites , we recall the main properties arising from translational invariance . in section [ s : semicl ] we describe a semiclassical variational approach to hamiltonian ( [ e : bhh ] ) based on a number - conserving trial state .",
    "this approach results into a set of dnls equations featuring a correction factor that makes them effective also in the deeply quantum regime characterized by large attractive interactions and small boson populations .",
    "furthermore , we describe the three regimes that can be recognized for the ground state of the one - dimensional periodic lattice under investigation . a _ schrdinger - cat regime _ for small values of the parameter @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the total number of bosons in the system ; a _ soliton regime _ , for intermediate values of @xmath14 ; a _ superfluid regime _ for large values of @xmath14 .",
    "we show that the crossover between the schrdinger - cat and soliton regimes occurs around a size - independent threshold @xmath15 , while the critical point marking the boundary between the soliton and superfluid regimes , @xmath16 , exhibits a clear dependence on the lattice size @xmath0 , which becomes linear for large sizes . in section [ s : results ]",
    "we illustrate the effectiveness of the semiclassical description introduced in section [ s : semicl ] . in particular ,",
    "we show that in the schrdinge - cat regime , the delocalized ground state of the quantum model is very well described by a coherent superposition of the degenerate localized ground states of the semiclassical picture .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the relevance of the semiclassical thresholds @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the quantum picture .",
    "in particular we show that the local observables considered in ref .",
    "@xcite are not sensitive to size dependent threshold @xmath16 , which is related to the finiteness of the system , but rather to the size - independent threshold @xmath15 , which is related to the discrete nature of the system .",
    "we also show that @xmath16 is signaled by nonlocal observables . in appendix",
    "[ s : sum ] we show that the variational trial state introduced in section [ s : semicl ] is actually a su@xmath1 coherent state , which is a further justification ( ? ) for the effectiveness of the semiclassical picture . in appendix",
    "[ s : pert ] we show that in the schrdinger - cat regime the localized ground state of the semiclassical picture coincides  at the first perturbative order in @xmath14  with a coherent superposition of the almost degenerate @xmath0 lowest states of hamiltonian ( [ e : bhh ] ) .",
    "let us now summarize the main properties of hamiltonian  ( [ e : bhh ] ) .",
    "first of all , we recall that the relevant hilbert space is in principle infinite , and it is spanned by the fock vectors generated by the action of the positive powers of the creation operators @xmath17 onto the vacuum state @xmath18 , i.e. the state such that @xmath19 for any @xmath20",
    ". however , hamiltonian  ( [ e : bhh ] ) commutes with the total number operator , @xmath21 , and hence its study can be restricted to the finite size eigenspaces of @xmath22 .",
    "henceforth , we assume to be in the eigenspace relevant to the total population @xmath13 , whose size is @xmath23 .",
    "as we mention , we are interested in the case of attractive bosons ( @xmath24 ) on a 1d homogeneous periodic lattice .",
    "hence we particularize the adjacency matrix in eq .",
    "( [ e : bhh ] ) to @xmath25 where , on a periodic lattice comprising @xmath0 sites , the site labels @xmath26 and @xmath27 correspond to sites @xmath0 and @xmath28 , respectively . with this choice hamiltonian  ( [ e : bhh ] ) is clearly translationally invariant .",
    "hence all of the relevant observables can not break this symmetry , i.e. exhibit a dependence on the site label . owing to the translational invariance",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath29 can be labeled by a further quantum number .",
    "this is made quite evident by switching to the reciprocal space , i.e. by introducing the transformed operators @xmath30 making the kinetic term of hamiltonian ( [ e : bhh ] ) diagonal .",
    "of course , the reciprocal space has the same size @xmath31 as the direct space , and it is spanned by the reciprocal fock vectors , generated by the action of the powers of the @xmath32 s on @xmath18 .",
    "note indeed that @xmath33 and that @xmath34 for any @xmath35 . in this representation",
    "the displacement operator changing @xmath3 into @xmath36 is simply @xmath37 since @xmath38=0 $ ] , the hamiltonian can be studied separately in the @xmath0 eigenspaces of @xmath39 .",
    "note indeed , that @xmath40 , which entails that the eigenvalues of the displacement operator are the @xmath41 roots of unity . after noticing that the reciprocal fock vectors are clearly eigenstates of @xmath39 , the block diagonal structure of @xmath29 can be made evident by simply arranging these states according to the relevant eigenvalue , which we denote by @xmath42 . a perhaps more convenient choice for the displacement quantum number is the integer @xmath43 $ ] such that @xmath44 .",
    "in particular , the ground state of the system is the lowest eigenstate of the block relevant to @xmath45 or , equivalently , @xmath46 .",
    "introducing a further integer label @xmath47 ranking the eigenstates of of hamiltonian ( [ e : bhh ] ) according to their energy , we set @xmath48 .",
    "in particular , @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the ground state of @xmath29 and its energy .",
    "we recall that this state is translationally invariant , while , more in general , all of the eigenstates of @xmath29 are delocalized .",
    "that is to say , these eigenvalues can not give rise to site - dependent expectation values of local operators , such as e.g. @xmath51 .",
    "this means that , at least in principle , the states @xmath52 exhibit the features of the celebrated _ schrdinger cat _ state .",
    "indeed , as it is well known , for @xmath53 the ground states of the @xmath0 blocks of @xmath29 are almost degenerate coherent superpositions of macroscopically localized states of the form @xmath54 ) perturbatively @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ s : results ] we show that the _ schrdinger cat _ structure of eq .",
    "( [ e : loc ] ) can be extended to a whole interval of @xmath55 ratios , by replacing the fock vectors @xmath56 with suitable su@xmath1 coherent states which are strictly related to the localized ground state of the semiclassical approximation to hamiltonian ( [ e : bhh ] ) .",
    "as we recall above , the attractive bose - hubbard model ( [ e : bhh ] ) has received significant attention also as the quantum counterpart @xcite of the so - called discrete self - trapping ( dst ) or discrete non - linear schrdinger ( dnls ) equations @xcite .",
    "these semiclassical equations are equivalently obtained by discretizing the gross - pitaevskii equations @xcite or applying to hamiltonian ( [ e : bhh ] ) a time dependent variational principle ( tdvp ) based on glauber s coherent states @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the same approach as ref .",
    "@xcite , using a macroscopic trial state of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ e : twf ] ) is a dynamical variable describing the bosons at lattice site @xmath10 through a macroscopic local phase and population , identified with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the request that the trial state satisfies the schrdinger equation on the average @xcite , @xmath61 , leads to the identification of @xmath62 with the effective lagrangian for the dynamical variables @xmath63 , and @xmath64 with the corresponding effective hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "minimizing @xmath65 with respect to the @xmath63 s provides a semiclassical variational approximation to the ground state of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian . introducing the chemical potential @xmath66 , i.e. a lagrange multiplier allowing for the normalization constraint in eq .",
    "( [ e : twf ] ) , the ensuing equations are @xmath67 we recall that eqs .",
    "( [ e : fpe ] ) are actually the fixed point equations corresponding to the equations of motion for the @xmath63 s @xmath68 obtained via the canonical poisson brackets @xmath69 . here by fixed points we mean the `` normal modes '' whose time evolution is entirely contained in a simple phase factor @xmath70 . equations  ( [ e : dst ] ) clearly belong to the dnls class and , as we show in the following section , they are able to capture many of the features of the quantum ground state also in the extreme quantum regime of large interactions and small populations .",
    "this is due to the extra @xmath71 factor appearing in their interaction term , which is absent in the dnls equations standardly adopted in the semiclassical approach to the bose - hubbard model .",
    "the presence of this extra factor is a direct consequence of the macroscopic trial state , eq .",
    "( [ e : twf ] ) , being an eigenstate of the total number operator @xmath22 .",
    "this is not true of the glauber coherent state product adopted as a trial function in standard tdvp , which conserves the total number of bosons only on the average @xcite .",
    "hence the resulting dynamical equations , which are perfectly equivalent to standard dnls equations , do not feature the extra @xmath72 factor .",
    "the effectiveness of the description provided by the macroscopic state ( [ e : twf ] ) can be explained by noticing that it is actually a coherent state itself , of su@xmath1 .",
    "note that @xmath13 is the algebra representation index of the present two - boson realization of su@xmath1 as confirmed by the fact that @xmath22 commutes with the algebra generators @xmath73 for any @xmath74 .",
    "hence the conservation of the boson population is already incorporated in this coherent state picture .",
    "this is illustrated in appendix [ s : sum ]    as it is well known , the nonlinear terms can break the translational symmetry characterizing hamiltonian ( [ e : scbh ] ) with the choice in eq .",
    "( [ e : homj ] ) .",
    "indeed , if the interaction @xmath6 is sufficiently strong , the ground state of the system is arbitrarily localized at one of the @xmath0 equivalent lattice sites .",
    "this ground state is a fixed point of eqs .",
    "( [ e : dst ] ) , and can be easily determined numerically by treating eqs .",
    "( [ e : fpe ] ) as a set of self - consistent linear equations @xcite .",
    "more in general , depending on the value of the @xmath55 ratio , it is possible to recognize three regimes for the semiclassical ground state . for large ratios ,",
    "the ground state is superfluid , the boson population being evenly spread over the entire lattice . for sufficiently low values of the @xmath55 ratio",
    "this delocalized superfluid solution becomes unstable , and the ground state of the system becomes soliton - like , featuring a localization peak breaking the translational symmetry of hamiltonian ( [ e : scbh ] ) .",
    "the critical point marking the boundary between the _ superfluid _ and _ soliton regime _ is @xmath75^{-1}$ ] , where we recall that we define @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "as @xmath14 is further decreased , the localization peak  which initially involves a significant number of lattice sites  becomes sharper and sharper , until the entire boson population is basically concentrated at a single lattice site .",
    "this situation is the is the semiclassical , symmetry - breaking counterpart of the schrdinger - cat state , where the boson localization is symmetrically distributed over all of the lattice sites . as we discuss in the sequel , it is possible to recognize a threshold , or rather a crossover , between this _ schrdinger - cat regime _ and the soliton regime where the localization peak involves a large portion of the lattice .",
    "note indeed that in the latter situation the periodic boundary conditions and the discretization of the lattice produce a small effect , and the ground state is well described by the solution to the nonlinear schrdinger equations on a 1d infinite domain , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the characteristic width of the population peak .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ f : regimes ] shows that this is actually a satisfactory approximation .",
    "hence , the crossover between the schrdinger cat and soliton regime can be estimated by requiring that this characteristic width equals the lattice spacing , i.e. @xmath79 , which results into @xmath80 .",
    "note that this is equivalently obtained by equalling the energies of the system in the two extreme situations @xmath81 and @xmath82 . indeed in the former case the ground state is completely localized and its energy is @xmath83 , while in the latter case the ground state is delocalized and its energy is @xmath84 .",
    "we emphasize that exactly the same estimate is obtained considering the energy of the quantum ground state .",
    "conversely , the delocalization transition at @xmath85 , marking the boundary between the soliton and superfluid regime , corresponds to the peak width being of the same order of the lattice size , @xmath86 .",
    "note indeed that @xmath16 is linear in @xmath0 for sufficiently large lattices @xcite .",
    "the regimes discussed above are quite evidently signalled by the behavior of the ( normalized ) interaction energy @xmath87 as a function of @xmath14 , where @xmath88 denotes expectation value on the trial state ( [ e : twf ] ) equipped with the ground state solution to the fixed point equations ( [ e : fpe ] ) .",

    "the crossover at @xmath92 corresponds to a change in the convexity plotted function .",
    "this is related to the ultraviolet cutoff due to the discreteness of the lattice .",

    "( [ e : int_en ] ) is also related to the fluctuation of the local density of bosons .",
    "in this section we compare the features of the semiclassical picture introduced in the preceding section to the corresponding features of the quantum model , eq .",
    "( [ e : bhh ] ) .",
    "first , we direct our attention to the energy and structure of the ground state . then , we discuss the relevance of the semiclassical thresholds in the quantum picture .",
    "we consider lattice comprising up to @xmath89 sites , and populations consisting of up to @xmath96 bosons .",
    "all of the quantum observables are obtained evaluating the eigenstates of hamiltonian ( [ e : bhh ] ) and the relevant energies by means of lanczos - like algorithms .",

    "furthermore , the agreement between the quantum and the classical result is extremely satisfactory both in the large @xmath14 and in the small @xmath14 region .",
    "the agreement in the former region is expected , since in the noninteracting limit the quantum ground state of the system is exactly given by eq .",
    "( [ e : twf ] ) with @xmath103 , which is nothing but the superfluid semiclassical ground state taking over after the delocalization transition at @xmath16 .",
    "the agreement in the strong interaction limit is more surprising , and it requires further discussion .",
    "indeed , in this region the semiclassical and the quantum ground states are significantly different , the former being strongly localized at one lattice site , while the latter being always completely delocalized . as we recall in sec .",

    "in particular we show that in this regime the delocalized quantum ground state of the system can be seen as a coherent superposition of the localized ground states of the variational approach .",
    "furthermore , we show that the three regimes clearly recognizable in the semiclassical picture are signalled by suitably chosen quantum observables .",
    "the latter result is compared with similar findings reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the intermediate regime",
    "the description provided by the above semiclassical picture is not as satisfactory as in the two outermost regimes .",
    "the structure of the quantum ground state in this parameter range is different , and probably much more complex , than that of the variational trial state ( [ e : twf ] ) , and requires further investigations .    before concluding this paper we briefly consider some experimental issues .",
    "first of all , we observe that attaining the deeply quantum schrdinger - cat regime might prove very challenging from the experimental point of view . indeed , this would be most likely obtained by starting from the ground state of the ( almost ) noninteracting superfluid regime , which is relatively easy to realize . by making use of feshbach resonances and/or by increasing the strength of the optical lattice , the ratio @xmath144 can be subsequently decreased down to suitably small values , so that the system is driven into the schrdinger - cat regime .",
    "note that , independent of the value of such ratio , the ground state of the system has always the same symmetry , i.e. it always belongs to the same eigenspace of the displacement operator defined in eq .",
    "( [ e : disp ] ) .",
    "this means that , at least in principle , only the relevant block of hamiltonian ( [ e : bhh ] ) is involved in the process .",
    "actually , this is true provided that the system is perfectly isolated from the environment . under this rather ideal assumption ,",
    "the achievement of the schrdinger - cat ground state basically depends on the adiabaticity of the parameter variation .",
    "however , the interaction with the environment much likely introduces a coupling between the ideally uncoupled blocks of hamiltonian ( [ e : bhh ] ) , which has dramatic effects in the strong interaction regime .",
    "indeed in this situation the actual ground state is almost degenerate with the lowest states of the blocks relevant to @xmath145 , and an arbitrarily small perturbation can induce a transition to one of these excited states .    another issue worth mentioning is the actual possibility of making measurements on a system such as the one considered here . as we recall in section [ s : intro ] , there is an upper bound to the number of attractive bosons @xmath13 that can be loaded into the optical lattice .",
    "indeed , the maximum attainable boson density @xmath146 must be sufficiently low to rule out the complex phenomena described in ref . @xcite . on a one - dimensional system like the one considered here",
    ", the maximum boson population compatible with such constraint can be too small to allow measurements , , such as e.g. absorption imaging .",
    "this difficulty can be possibly circumvented by considering a stack of coaxial _ necklace _ optical lattices isolated from each other , in place of a single necklace @xcite .",
    "assuming that these lattices can be loaded with the same number of bosons , they are expected to behave like copies of the system discussed in this paper . on the other hand ,",

    "the cs variational method exhibits two further noticeable features .",
    "first , the classical poisson brackets characterizing the @xmath192 dynamics preserve the algebraic structure of the operators constituting @xmath187 and generating the group @xmath147 .",
    "also , the coherent - state labels @xmath191 , beyond their canonical role in the @xmath193 dynamics , are the expectation values of hamiltonian operators that embody information on microscopic interaction processes . for example , in the specific case under investigation , @xmath194 , @xmath195 in hamiltonian ( [ e : scbh ] ) are manifestly related to @xmath196 and @xmath51 in hamiltonian ( [ e : bhh ] ) .",
