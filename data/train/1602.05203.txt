    "ongoing dedicated studies of the transient sky are revealing an increasingly wide diversity of explosive and eruptive stellar transients that are less luminous than traditional supernovae ( sne ) , but more luminous than classical novae .",
    "there is a broad range of theoretical mechanisms that might account for these , yet linking physical mechanisms to individual observed phenomena remains challenging .",
    "extragalactic events being discovered in modern transient surveys occur at distances where detailed information about the progenitor star or potential surviving star is scarce , complicating any connection to observed galactic populations .",
    "more than a decade ago , few such events were known , and the transients with luminosities between those of novae and sne were generally linked to the class of eruptive massive stars known as luminous blue variables ( lbvs ; @xcite ) .",
    "names like sn impostors , type  v sne , or @xmath1 carinae variables were often taken to be synonyms of lbvs @xcite . with the increasing observed diversity of the sn impostor - like transients ,",
    "however , some differentiation in observed properties also developed .",
    "proposed observational subclasses include lbv giant eruptions @xcite , sn  2008s - like events @xcite , and a class of luminous red variables that have been linked to collisions and merger events ( see below ) .",
    "the sn  2008s - like sources , including the well - studied event ngc  300-ot2008 @xcite and its kin , seem to be distinguished in that they have heavily dust - enshrouded progenitors , more monotonic optical light - curve evolution , strong [ ca  ii ] and ca  ii emission features , and strong infrared ( ir ) excess at late times @xcite . some lbvs share these properties @xcite , but the sn  2008s - like progenitors tend to have lower luminosities and implied masses @xcite than the recognized mass and luminosity ranges for lbvs @xcite .",
    "in addition , unlike lbvs , there is no clear sign that sn  2008s - like transients survive the event @xcite . the class of red transients identified as possible mergers also tend to have lower - mass progenitors when this information is available , but their progenitors do not appear to be as heavily enshrouded in dust as the sn  2008s - like objects . moreover , the sn  2008s - like objects and the lower - mass merger outbursts seem to trace different galactic stellar populations . in this paper",
    ", we suggest a new potential member of this class of merger objects , but with a higher initial mass than any object in this class studied so far . this new object in ngc  4490 also shares many properties in common with giant lbv eruptions , so the distinction between lbvs and merger events may be blurry .",
    "@xcite presented the most direct and dramatic evidence linking one of these transients to a violent stellar merger event .",
    "they analyzed archival optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) photometry and found that the progenitor of the 2008 galactic transient v1309  sco had been an eclipsing binary , and that the orbital period decreased rapidly leading up to the catastrophic transient event .",
    "the progenitor star was thought to have an initial mass of 12 m@xmath2 , while the transient event had a peak absolute magnitude of roughly @xmath36.9 mag ( @xmath4 band ; vega - based magnitudes ) , although the distance is uncertain , and a duration of about a month .",
    "a brighter galactic event was the 2002 transient v838  mon , with a peak absolute visual magnitude of about @xmath39.8 , a longer duration of about 8090 d , and a very irregular , multi - peaked light curve @xcite .",
    "the progenitor of this transient was thought to be more massive ( 510 m@xmath2 ) , due to a small host cluster with b - type stars still on the main sequence @xcite .",
    "it also had a b3  v companion star that was engulfed by the expanding dusty ejecta several years after the outburst .",
    "mon is perhaps best known for the series of spectacular colour light - echo images taken by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) @xcite .",
    "both v1309  sco and v838  mon started out with relatively smooth continuum emission plus narrow balmer emission lines , but developed very red optical colours , atomic and molecular absorption features , and strong signatures of dust in their spectra as they faded @xcite .",
    "the observed properties of these transients appear to be consistent with theoretical expectations for merger events @xcite .",
    "other events that may belong to the same class are the galactic transients v4332 sgr in 1994 @xcite and ogle 2002-blg-360 @xcite , and potentially also the historical galactic novae ck  vul @xcite , and v1148  sgr @xcite .",
    "proposed extragalactic counterparts include m31  rv @xcite , m85  ot2006 - 1 @xcite , and the transient in m31 discovered in january 2015 @xcite .",
    "@xcite have estimated the galactic rates for merger events and found them to be quite common , with approximate values of 0.1 yr@xmath5 for fainter events like v1309  sco , and 0.03 yr@xmath5 for brighter events like v838  mon .",
    "@xcite also suggest that the peak luminosity of the resulting transient is a steep function of the stellar mass , similar to the mass - luminosity relation on the main sequence .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the bright optical and ir transient source that appeared in 2011 in the host galaxy ngc  4490 , and we demonstrate that it bears some interesting similarities to the class of mergers discussed above .",
    "we also point out that despite its similar peak luminosity , this new event appears to have less in common with sn  2008s - like transients .",
    "the object was first recognized as a transient in the optical , so for brevity we refer to it here as ngc  4490-ot , although subsequently it was also shown to be a transient source in the thermal ir .",
    "it is also designated as psn  j12304185 + 4137498 , and in our ir transient search described below it was found independently and named spirits  14pz .",
    "ngc  4490-ot was discovered in unfiltered ccd images on 2011 aug 16.83 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) by @xcite , located 57 west and 37 south of the bright centre of the nearby galaxy ngc  4490 .",
    "its coordinates are @xmath6 = 12@xmath730@xmath841@xmath984 ; @xmath10 = + 41@xmath1137@xmath1249@xmath137 .",
    "ngc  4490 is part of a pair of actively star - forming interacting galaxies ( the other galaxy in the pair is ngc  4485 ; see figure  [ fig : hst ] ) , and ngc  4490 was also the host galaxy as for the type  iib event sn  2008ax . according to the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , the host has an average redshift of @xmath14 ( 565 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "this would imply a distance of @xmath15 mpc and a distance modulus of @xmath16 mag .",
    "however , in their study of sn  2008ax , @xcite noted some inconsistencies in the distances to the two galaxies in the interacting pair and derived an average distance combining several techniques of @xmath17 mpc and @xmath18 mag .",
    "we adopt these latter values here .",
    "we also adopt a line - of - sight milky way reddening of @xmath19 mag ( @xmath20 mag , @xmath21 mag ) from @xcite .",
    "there may be additional host - galaxy reddening ( @xcite estimate @xmath22 mag for sn  2008ax , which is in a similar part of the galaxy ) , or circumstellar reddening , but we consider these in more detail later .    with the above adopted parameters , the discovery brightness of the transient corresponds to an absolute magnitude ( assumed to be roughly @xmath23 band ) of about @xmath313.3 mag . as discussed below , the peak luminosity 100200 d later is somewhat higher , around @xmath314.2 mag ( with the additional host - galaxy reddening that we favor in the discussion below , the peak would be about @xmath315 mag ) .",
    "this implies that the object may be related to the broad class of sn impostors that are less luminous than core - collapse sne .",
    "early classification spectra obtained on 2011 aug .",
    "18.9 and 19.9 ( days 23 after discovery ) showed a blue continuum and bright , narrow balmer emission lines , plus some fainter fe  ii lines @xcite , qualitatively similar to known spectra of lbv eruptions @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite noted that there was no bright , blue star known at that position in previously obtained archival _",
    "hst _ images , while archival _ spitzer _",
    "data did not reveal a bright mid - ir source either , apparently disfavouring a very luminous lbv progenitor .",
    "@xcite conducted a more detailed analysis of the archival _ hst _ images , and proposed that a source at the nominal position of the transient was a likely progenitor detection , with an absolute magnitude @xmath36.2 in the f606w filter in the mid 1990s .",
    "( with the somewhat different distance and reddening we adopt , this corresponds to @xmath36.4 mag . )",
    "this is much brighter at visual wavelengths than the heavily dust - enshrouded progenitors of sn  2008s and ngc  300-ot @xcite , and only modestly fainter than the @xmath37.5 mag progenitor of the lbv - like transient ugc  2773-ot @xcite and the lbv progenitor of the sn  1954j eruption @xcite .",
    "this may suggest that the progenitor and its outburst are related to the lbv phenomenon in more massive stars , but as we detail below , it also shares some interesting properties with lower - luminosity transients that are thought to arise from stellar merger events .    ._hst _ imaging and photometry of ngc  4490-ot [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : spectab ]    @xmath24day refers to approximate days after discovery , 2011 aug 16.83 .",
    "we obtained five epochs of visible - wavelength spectroscopy during the sharp decline after the second luminosity spike that occurred around day 150 ; this also coincided with the time when ngc  4490 returned from behind the sun and when our kait photometric monitoring began .",
    "we used the bluechannel ( bc ) spectrograph on the 6.5-m multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) and the kast spectrograph @xcite on the lick 3-m shane reflector , with observation details given in table  [ tab : spectab ] .",
    "the slit was always oriented at the parallactic angle @xcite , and the long - slit spectra were reduced using standard procedures .",
    "final spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "some of the comparison spectra in figure  [ fig : spectra ] were taken from the berkeley sn spectral database as noted in the caption .",
    "the lick / kast spectra covered a wide wavelength range at low resolution in a blue and a red channel , while the mmt / bc spectra either covered a wide range in a single order ( 300 line mm@xmath5 grating ) or a smaller wavelength range with higher resolution ( 1200 line mm@xmath5 grating ) including na  i  d @xmath255890 , 5896 and h@xmath26 . for days 154 and 168 in figure  [ fig : spectra ] we show a representative blackbody for comparison .",
    "all epochs exhibit strong line blanketing in the blue , and the characteristic temperature gets cooler with time as the transient fades rapidly .",
    "narrow h@xmath26 emission and the ca   ii near - ir triplet in absorption remain prominent at all epochs .    in our moderate - resolution mmt spectrum",
    "taken on day 155 near the time of peak luminosity , we measure a total na  i  d equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath27   .",
    "this is the total ew , including galactic absorption and absorption in the local host galaxy ( at the redshift of ngc  4490 ) , as well as absorption in the photosphere of the transient ; these components are blended at our observed resolution . examining the spectra , the strong na  i absorption is blueshifted absorption that forms part of a p - cygni profile with narrow na   i  d emission .",
    "it is therefore likely that a large fraction of this absorption occurs in the wind / atmosphere of the transient source , and is therefore not a reliable measure of any local extinction .",
    "the milky way reddening value is @xmath19 mag , as noted above , but there may be additional local host - galaxy reddening .",
    "a value of @xmath22 mag for additional host reddening was inferred for the sn  2008ax by @xcite , which is located nearby in the same galaxy , and below we discuss the likely value for the specific location of ngc4490-ot based on photometry of stars in the local environment .",
    "any increase in the assumed reddening would increase our estimates of the peak luminosity of the transient , the inferred luminosity and mass of the progenitor , and the brightness of the dust - obscured source at visible wavelengths , but it would not change our estimate of the ir luminosity seen at late times .      on 2014",
    "june 7 we obtained a near - ir @xmath28-band spectrum at the position of ngc  4490-ot in its late - time aftermath of the outburst , using mosfire on keck .",
    "although _ spitzer _ data indicate a strong thermal - ir excess at this epoch , we did not detect continuum emission or any emission lines in our mosfire spectrum with an exposure time of 1074s .",
    "as is often the case , the nature of the progenitor star that one infers from a single - filter _ hst _ detection is clouded by the possibility of large and uncertain local extinction in the host galaxy . local dust",
    " especially circumstellar dust that surrounded the progenitor  may have been vaporised by the transient event , and there may be additional ism extinction in this particular region of the host galaxy . to assist in our analysis of the progenitor below , we consider stars in the surrounding environment of ngc  4490-ot for additional constraints on the possible and likely local ism extinction .",
    "figure  [ fig : cc ] compares colours from the _ hst _ legus photometry , particularly in the uv and blue bands , to the colour - colour loci for normal supergiant stars , and also assumes a reddening vector following @xcite with @xmath29 . in figure",
    "[ fig : cc ] , sources within a 100 pc projected radius of ngc  4490-ot are green open squares , and those projected within 50 pc are redopen squares . for reference , the blue dashed line shows a reddening vector corresponding to @xmath30 mag .",
    "the resulting plot shows a great deal of scatter , indicating patchy and sometimes large extinction in the surroundings . some stars in the surrounding 100 pc ( green and red ) have colours consistent with little or no reddening , while some show colours that suggest as much as 2 mag of @xmath4-band extinction .",
    "indeed , it is apparent from the colour image in figure  [ fig : hst ] that ngc  4490 is speckled with patchy extinction .",
    "this holds true when we restrict ourselves only to the few sources within 50 pc ( red ) . in the left panel of figure  [ fig : cc ] ( f336w  f438w vs.  f438w ",
    "f555w ) , one of the two red points at the top right of the plot corresponds to a star only a few ( 68 ) pixels from ngc  4490-ot , and this star has a colour consistent with @xmath31 mag .",
    "this might suggest rather large extinction in the immediate environment of the transient . on the other hand , many of the other stars have a range of values from @xmath32 to @xmath31 mag . since choosing between these remains uncertain , in our analysis of the progenitor below we consider the impact of three different options for the adopted local reddening in addition to the milky way line - of - sight reddening .",
    "option ( 1 ) corresponds to no additional local reddening as a lower limit , for option ( 2 ) we consider @xmath33 mag as a likely value , and for option ( 3 ) we consider @xmath34 mag as a likely upper limit to the local reddening .      the late - time _",
    "images show a source at the same position as the progenitor , but fainter .",
    "this fading confirms the candidate progenitor source first identified by @xcite .",
    "we measure an f606w absolute magnitude of @xmath35 for the progenitor around 6100 days before the transient was discovered ( corrected only for milky way reddening ) .",
    "the pre - eruption _ hst _ data include only a single filter and only one epoch , but this offers some useful constraints on the possible nature of the progenitor . with no attempt at a bolometric correction",
    ", the progenitor system must be at least as luminous as the progenitor of sn  2008s ( and almost as luminous as the progenitor of ngc  300-ot ) . unlike sn  2008s and ngc  300-ot , however , this detection is at visible wavelengths , so the progenitor is not as heavily obscured by its own circumstellar dust .    on the other hand , the progenitor could also be blue , like the progenitor of sn  1954j and other lbvs . in this case",
    "the f606w absolute magnitude of @xmath36.4 mag is a lower limit to the bolometric luminosity , because a bolometric correction or extinction correction must raise the progenitor s bolometric luminosity .",
    "in fact , we favour the interpretation that the progenitor was a more luminous blue star , based largely on the ir nondetection of the progenitor in _ spitzer _ data .",
    "the ir nondetections actually place strong constraints , provided that the star did not change substantially between 1994 ( _ hst _ f606w image ) and 2004 ( _ spitzer _ bands 1 and 2 ) .",
    "of course , the star might have changed its luminosity and colour somewhat in this time if it was out of equilibrium and approaching a merger or some other disruptive event , so we can only take this information as approximate ( moreover , if v1309  sco or lbv eruptions like @xmath1 car provide guidance , the star may have been brightening and getting cooler as it approached its transient event , which would reinforce the analysis below ) . with this potential caveat",
    "aside , the _ spitzer _",
    "nondetections of the progenitor are quite constraining .",
    "5-diameter aperture ( filled circles).,width=278 ]    figure  [ fig : sed ] shows the sed of the candidate progenitor of ngc  4490-ot , as well as its aftermath ( described below ) .",
    "we plot the _ hst _ f606w detection in 1994 , plus the upper limits to @xmath36 from our _ spitzer _ irac band 1 and 2 nondetections in 2004 ( open blue diamonds ) .",
    "for the _ hst _ f606w detection of the progenitor we must assign an extinction correction , but this is uncertain , as noted above .",
    "following an analysis of stars in the local environment of the transient , we consider three options for the extinction correction , and we plot all three of these on the sed in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "they are discussed below , along with implications for the nature of the progenitor .",
    "_ option 1 : _ here we correct only for the adopted line - of - sight milky way reddening of @xmath37 mag with zero additional reddening in the host galaxy .",
    "this is regarded as a lower limit .",
    "a blackbody through the f606w point and below the irac limits would need to have a temperature of at least 7500  k and a luminosity of more than 9600l@xmath2 .",
    "this would correspond to a relatively low - luminosity f - type supergiant or giant from an intermediate - mass star .",
    "this luminosity is more than an order of magnitude lower than the post - outburst ir luminosity .",
    "_ option 2 : _ next we consider adding @xmath33 mag of local extinction ( @xmath38 mag ) , so the total reddening is @xmath39 mag .",
    "we regard this reddening correction as a likely value , and it is similar to the value adopted for sn  2008ax by @xcite .",
    "this f606w point and the irac limits would correspond to a blackbody with a temperature of at least 14,000  k ( late b - type ) and a luminosity of @xmath40 l@xmath2 or more .",
    "such a star might be very similar to the class of lower - luminosity lbvs in their quiescent state , like hr carinae or hd  168625 @xcite .",
    "they have effective initial masses ( compared to single - star models ) of @xmath41 m@xmath2 . for lbvs",
    ", there are of course significant caveats to an `` initial mass '' derived from single - star evolution models in cases where binary mass transfer or mergers may be relevant ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since the reddening is very uncertain , the temperature and luminosity could easily be somewhat more or less , but more reddening would simultaneously require the star to be more luminous and hotter , moving it roughly along the s  dor instability strip .",
    "this makes it seem plausible that the progenitor star was indeed a quiescent lbv .",
    "interestingly , the luminosity of such a progenitor is within a factor of 23 of the post - outburst ir source s luminosity , which would be consistent with the star surviving the event or with a merger product that is even more luminous than the progenitor .",
    "interpreting the progenitor as a lower - luminosity lbv would also seem to be consistent with the relatively sparse environment in the vicinity of ngc  4490-ot ( i.e. , not in a massive cluster or h  ii region ) , since these lower - luminosity lbvs tend to be tens to hundreds of pc from clusters of o - type stars @xcite .",
    "_ option 3 : _ next we consider adding @xmath34 mag of local extinction ( @xmath42 mag ) , based on the extinction inferred for the detected star nearest to the transient source , so the total reddening is @xmath43 mag .",
    "we regard this as a probable upper limit for the local ism reddening within the host galaxy , although there may also have been considerable circumstellar extinction that was destroyed by the transient event .",
    "a blackbody through this f606w point and below the irac limits would need to be a very hot and luminous star , with @xmath44  k and @xmath45 l@xmath2 .",
    "such a star would be a very luminous early o - type main - sequence star or a wnh star with an initial mass around 80100 m@xmath2 .",
    "given the relative isolation of ngc  4490-ot in its host galaxy , this seems less likely than option 2 .    in any of the three options above",
    ", the ir upper limits do not allow the source detected by _",
    "hst _ to be a cool evolved star like an asymptotic giant branch star or red supergiant .",
    "we therefore consider it quite plausible that the progenitor was a traditional lbv or related class of evolved luminous blue star ( option 2 ) .",
    "options 1 and 3 seem much less likely for the reasons noted above . in any case , it is interesting that the progenitor of n4490-ot is substantially more luminous and more massive than the expected progenitor systems of v838 mon ( roughly @xmath31.5 mag ; b - type star ) or the low - mass progenitor of v1309 sco ( roughly @xmath464.8 mag ) .",
    "the position of the transient was observed again at late times with _",
    "hst_/wfc3 , 805 days after discovery , and this time we have more colour information from multiple _ hst _ filter detections from the uv to near - ir .",
    "we also have a ground - based near - ir detection in the @xmath28 band , plus clear detections with irac bands 1 and 2 at four epochs between 300 and 1000 days after discovery .",
    "these late - time measurements of the sed are also plotted in figure  [ fig : sed ] , where we choose the irac band 1 and 2 photometry closest in time to the _ hst _ photometry ; we do not see evidence of strong ir variability at 9001000 days , only a gradual fading . for the late - time _",
    "photometry , we show two measurements of the same data .",
    "the unfilled circles correspond to psf - fitting photometry from the legus photometric catalog ( see table  [ tab : hstphot ] , while the filled circles represent magnitudes measured using a 0@xmath135-diameter aperture .    in figure  [ fig : sed ] , the observed photometry of the late - time source ( black filled circles ) is compared to a simple two - component model with a reddened hot star and warm dust .",
    "the reddened star is the same 14,000  k blackbody matched to the progenitor in option 2 above , but reddened by @xmath47 mag .",
    "the dust component is a single - temperature 725  k grey body ( @xmath48 emissivity ) that fits the @xmath28-band and irac points reasonably well . given that this two - component model is probably quite oversimplified , the resulting combined model gives a fair representation of the observed photometry excluding the f275w point .",
    "the f275w measurement is admittedly somewhat strange ; the f275w ",
    "f336w colour is steeper than the rayleigh - jeans tail of an unreddened blackbody , so it seems likely that the f275w filter has some strong contamination from mg  ii @xmath492800 line emission .",
    "except for this point , it appears plausible that the post - outburst source is a luminous hot star enshrouded by its own circumstellar dust that was formed in the eruption event . in this sense",
    ", it conforms to traditional expectations for a giant lbv eruption .",
    "the fact that the irac band 1 and 2 fluxes have not dropped more substantially at late times is physically significant .",
    "a strong ir excess at late times indicates either pre - existing circumstellar medium ( csm ) dust or dust that was newly formed in material ejected during the outburst . in any case",
    ", the dust could be heated by a luminous post - outburst source ( indicating that the star likely survived the event ) , or it could be an `` ir echo '' wherein surrounding dust is heated by the pulse of uv / optical radiation from the transient event itself , and then re - emits its absorbed uv / optical energy in the thermal ir .    for an ir echo , the maximum dust temperature and",
    "the dust luminosity should fall with time as the light echo expands ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the hottest dust will be found at the point of the light - echo paraboloid that is closest to the source , which is on the far side of the transient source in a spherical dust shell .",
    "this is at a radius of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the speed of light and @xmath52 is the time since the uv / optical peak of the transient source . for a pulse with peak luminosity @xmath53 , the grain temperature of the hottest echo - heated dust at @xmath54",
    "is then given by    @xmath55    where @xmath56/@xmath57 describes the grain efficiency in the uv ( absorption ) and ir ( emission ) , and @xmath58 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . at @xmath591000  d after the peak ,",
    "when our @xmath28-band and second epoch of irac data were obtained , the minimum radius of the echo was @xmath60 pc .",
    "at that radius the observed dust temperature of @xmath61  k would require a transient peak luminosity of roughly @xmath62 l@xmath2 @xmath63 .",
    "we do nt know the grain properties _ a priori _ , but assuming a typical value of @xmath64 would require an absolute magnitude of @xmath323.6 mag .",
    "this is more luminous than any known sn , and of course vastly more luminous than the observed ir source , so we conclude that the observed colour temperature of the ir excess at late times is too hot to be explained by an ir echo .",
    "the dust must be located much closer to a central engine . moreover",
    ", the temperature of the hottest echo - heated dust will fall as @xmath65 . at the time of our first epoch of irac observations around day 360",
    ", the maximum dust temperature should have been around 1200  k. this would shift the peak of the sed from 4 @xmath0 m at day 1000 to around 2.4 @xmath0 m at the earlier epoch .",
    "however , there is little change in the colour and ir luminosity between our irac epochs , adding further doubt to the ir - echo hypothesis .",
    "on the other hand , the roughly constant post - outburst ir luminosity is close to the reddening - corrected progenitor star s luminosity for our favoured option 2 above .",
    "the factor of @xmath66 luminosity difference between the progenitor model of a 14,000 k star and the late - time ir luminosity could easily be accounted for by ( 1 ) a slightly higher temperature and luminosity for the progenitor for the same reddening ( the irac upper limits only provide a lower limit to the star s temperature ) or a somewhat higher reddening , ( 2 ) some contribution from an ir echo or residual luminosity from the fading eruption , or ( 3 ) an actual increase in the luminosity of the post - outburst source as one might expect if it were a stellar merger or if there was some other energy injection into the star s envelope .",
    "the pre- and post - outburst luminosities are , however , of the same order of magnitude , making it plausible that the relatively constant late - time ir excess is caused by a dust shell heated by a central surviving star .    for the ir luminosity of the dust shell , @xmath67 ,",
    "an equilibrium grain temperature of 725  k in a spherical shell corresponds to a radius of roughly 80 au . to reach this radius by a time of @xmath68 d after ejection would require an expansion speed of roughly 160 km s@xmath5",
    "of course , small grains may be hotter than the equilibrium blackbody temperature , so the implied radius and required ejection speed may be a factor of 2 - 3 higher .",
    "as noted below , we infer ejection speeds from spectra of a few hundred km s@xmath5 .",
    "given factors of 2 or more owing to geometric uncertainty ( we see evidence for asymmetry , as noted below ) , the observed ir sed at late times is reasonably consistent with expectations for emitting warm dust that formed from mass ejected in the 20112012 transient event .",
    "it is less likely that this is pre - existing dust , since dust at this same radius ( @xmath6980 au ) would have been heated to a temperature of around 2200  k by the peak luminosity of the transient , and would therefore have been largely destroyed .    for standard assumptions about the grain density",
    ", an ir luminosity of @xmath70 l@xmath2 for 725  k dust requires an emitting mass of , very roughly , @xmath71 m@xmath2 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the uncertainty may be a factor of 2 or more depending on assumptions about the grains , but then again , this is merely a lower limit to the dust mass since there may be a much larger mass of cool dust present and emitting primarily at far - ir wavelengths and unconstrained by our 35 @xmath0 m data .",
    "the near - ir excess therefore gives little useful information about the total mass ejected in the event .      from initial unfiltered magnitude estimates reported by amateur astronomers ,",
    "ngc  4490-ot showed an initial peak at an absolute magnitude of roughly @xmath313.5 , followed by a fast decline in the weeks after discovery ( figure  [ fig : phot ] ) .",
    "it then became unobservable because it was too close to the sun during days 30120 after discovery .",
    "when we began our unfiltered kait photometric monitoring after the source became observable again , we found it to be brighter than at discovery , and was rising again to a second peak at @xmath72160 d , reaching an absolute unfiltered ( approximately @xmath23-band ) peak of @xmath314.2 mag ( correcting only for milky way extinction ) .",
    "the source then faded rapidly for @xmath73  d after this second peak .",
    "subsequently , the decline slowed , and the average ( interpolated ) decline rate between days 220 and 800 was similar to the @xmath74co decay rate ( figure  [ fig : phot ] ) , although we do not have data to characterize the details of the decline in this time interval .",
    "unfortunately , we did not obtain multi - filter photometry to document the optical colour evolution during and after peak .",
    "however , our visible - wavelength spectra ( see below ) do show increasingly red colours and an evolution to cooler apparent temperatures during this time , as the source faded from peak .",
    "in fact , the colours became quite red at the latest epochs observed by _",
    "hst _ at day 805 , with a strong ir excess .",
    "the light curve of ngc  4490-ot , with multiple peaks and an evolution to red colours and ir excess , is qualitatively reminiscent of the complex multi - peaked light curves observed in some galactic transients that have been described as stellar merger events .",
    "both v838  mon and v1309  sco show an initial blue peak with a rapid decline on a time scale similar to that of ngc  4490-ot , and a comparably luminous second or third peak after that with increasingly red colour .",
    "the light curves of these two objects are shown in figure  [ fig : phot ] . an important difference in the light curves , however , is that ngc  4490-ot had a much higher peak luminosity , and a longer duration .",
    "v1309 sco faded in about one month and v838 mon faded in 8090 days , while ngc  4490-ot stayed bright for @xmath69200 days .",
    "interestingly , the duration and brightness of these events appears to correlate with the suspected mass of their progenitor stars , as we discuss later .",
    "the 19th century great eruption of @xmath1 carinae also showed multiple narrow peaks followed by a longer broad plateau @xcite , and its duration was a decade or more . since @xmath1 car is likely to be a much more massive star , it may extend this same correlation .    the bright phase of the transient ( days 0200 ) is poorly sampled because the source s position in the sky was near the sun for much of this time .",
    "simply interpolating between observation dates and integrating the optical luminosity can give a crude estimate of the total radiated energy ( ignoring any bolometric correction ) of very roughly @xmath75 ergs .",
    "this is less than @xmath1 car s giant eruption , but substantially more than other less - energetic lbv eruptions like p cygni @xcite or sn  1954j @xcite .",
    "it is also orders of magnitude more than the lower - mass stellar merger sources mentioned above .",
    "line profiles in our spectra of ngc  4490-ot .",
    "the two mmt spectra on days 155 and 197 have higher spectral resolution than the other three .",
    "the spectrum in red plotted over the day 155 spectrum shows what the h@xmath26 line profile would look like if it were symmetric , by taking the red wing of the line and reflecting it to the blue side of the line .",
    "also , the day 155 spectrum is reproduced in blue and plotted over the last epoch on day 197 for comparison , showing that the blueshifted absorption on day 155 occurred at similar velocities to the excess blue emission on day 197 .",
    "representative velocities of @xmath3650 km s@xmath5 ( blue edge of the absorption ) and @xmath3280 km s@xmath5 ( middle of the absorption trough and emission peak ) are shown with purple dashed lines.,width=278 ]      figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the evolution of the visible - wavelength spectrum of ngc  4490-ot .",
    "unfortunately , we were not able to obtain any early - time spectra .",
    "as noted above , however , @xcite reported that early - time spectra showed a blue continuum with bright narrow balmer emission lines reminiscent of lbvs .",
    "our spectra document times just before the second peak , which is the time of maximum observed luminosity , and the rapid decline from this main peak . at these phases ,",
    "ngc  4490-ot showed a warm continuum consistent with temperatures around 5000  k , accompanied by weak h@xmath26 emission , strong ca  ii absorption ( both the h&k lines and the near - ir triplet ) , and strong metal line - blanketing absorption in the blue .",
    "this apparent temperature around 5000  k is similar to that indicated by spectroscopy of light echoes from @xmath1 carinae s 19th century eruption @xcite .",
    "similar absorption features were also seen in the light echo spectra of @xmath1 car and some extragalactic lbvs like ugc  2773-ot @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the spectra of ngc  4490-ot do not show the forbidden [ ca  ii ] @xmath257291 , 7323 doublet in emission ( or the ca  ii near - ir triplet in emission ) , which is another way that ngc  4490-ot seems distinct from sn  2008s - like objects @xcite .",
    "the spectra of ngc  4490-ot during its decline do , however , bear a striking resemblance to spectra of the galactic transient v838 mon during its decline from peak luminosity @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] compares our spectra of ngc  4490-ot to those of v838  mon .",
    "( while the times after peak of 3070 days for v838  mon are different than for the day 150200 spectra of ngc  4490-ot , these trace similar epochs during the decline because ngc  4490-ot had a much longer timescale , fading at 180200 days instead of @xmath76 days for v838  mon ) .",
    "spectra of both objects show a similar evolution in apparent continuum slope , they both exhibit a similar forest of narrow atomic absorption lines and line blanketing in the blue that are characteristic of yellow f and g - type supergiants , and both have very strong ca  ii absorption in the h&k lines , as well as strong absorption in the ca  ii near - ir triplet .",
    "a notable difference is that v838 mon did not exhibit strong h@xmath26 in emission during these epochs , whereas ngc  4490-ot did .",
    "( v838  mon did , however , show h@xmath26 emission at some earlier epochs ; @xcite . )",
    "the emission ew rises from about @xmath77   at peak ( we measure @xmath78   on day 155 , with similar values and larger uncertainty in the lower - resolution spectra around the same time ) to @xmath79   as it was fading quickly on day 197 .",
    "h@xmath26 seen in emission for a longer time may be indicative of a higher mass - loss rate in ngc  4490-ot than v838  mon , and in this respect , ngc  4490-ot is more akin to lbvs with h@xmath26 emission in eruption . unfortunately , little work has been done using radiative - transfer models to derive quantitative physical parameters from the h@xmath26 strength in a giant lbv eruption .    even without such radiative - transfer models , however , the h@xmath26 line profile can provide some interesting physical information about the kinematics of the ngc  4490-ot transient event .",
    "figure  [ fig : halpha ] shows the h@xmath26 line profile in our five epochs of spectroscopy for this object . in this plot ,",
    "zero velocity is determined from the centroid of extended narrow ( unresolved ) h@xmath26 emission along the slit , arising from h  ii regions in the same region of the host galaxy . of these 5 epochs , the two mmt spectra with relatively high resolution ( 1200 line mm@xmath5 grating",
    "; days 155 and 197 ) are the most informative .",
    "the h@xmath26 line near peak ( day 155 ) shows an asymmetric p  cygni - like profile .",
    "( the spectra from days 154 , 165 , and 168 are consistent with a similar line profile observed with degraded resolution . ) in figure  [ fig : halpha ] , we take the red side of the line and reflect it about zero velocity and plot it over the blueshifted side of the line ; this reflected red wing is shown in red . at velocities of @xmath3650 to @xmath31200 km s@xmath5 ,",
    "the reflected red wing overlaps well with the blue wing , but the blueshifted side of h@xmath26 shows a pronounced deficit at 0 to @xmath3650 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this comparison gives a strong indication that the underlying emission component of h@xmath26 is a symmetric triangular profile , and that the asymmetry is caused by strong blueshifted self - absorption arising from a dense outflow with expansion speeds up to 650 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the blue edge ( @xmath3650 km s@xmath5 , representing the maximum outflow speed along the line of sight ) and the centroid of the p - cygni absorption trough ( roughly @xmath3280 km s@xmath5 , perhaps representing the bulk outflow speed ) are marked with dashed vertical purple lines in figure  [ fig : halpha ] .",
    "this outflow speed is reminiscent of the nebula around @xmath1  car @xcite , which has expansion speeds ranging from about 40 km s@xmath5 at the equator to 650 km s@xmath5 at the pole .",
    "note that the extremes of the line wings are probably broadened by electron scattering , and do not necessarily reflect the maximum expansion speed .",
    "these representative speeds in the p - cygni absorption profile at peak luminosity ( day 155 ) become quite interesting when we examine the later spectrum on day 197 , during the rapid decline after peak ( figure  [ fig : halpha ] ) .",
    "it also shows an asymmetric profile , but this time it has excess blueshifted _ emission _ instead of absorption .",
    "indeed , the h@xmath26 line profile has a strong blueshifted emission bump with a similar centroid at @xmath3280 km s@xmath5 and a comparable range of speeds as the absorption trough seen earlier on day 155 . in figure",
    "[ fig : halpha ] , we overplot the day 155 h@xmath26 profile ( in blue ) on the day 197 spectrum for comparison , and the purple vertical dashed lines show speeds of @xmath3650 and @xmath3280 km s@xmath5 for reference .",
    "the h@xmath26 profile with the strong blue emission bump on day 197 is quite unusual , but some similar features have been seen before .",
    "a comparable blue emission bump in h@xmath26 was recently reported in the late - time spectra of ugc  2773-ot , which is a decade - long lbv - like eruption similar to @xmath1 carinae @xcite . in the same analysis",
    ", @xcite also showed that line emission from the present - day bipolar nebula around @xmath1 car shows a similar blue emission bump .",
    "an asymmetric blue bump in h@xmath26 has also been seen at faster speeds in several sne  iin @xcite , usually attributed to bipolar or perhaps disk - like geometry in the shock interaction .",
    "a corresponding red bump is usually assumed to be weaker or absent owing to extinction by dust or occultation by the opaque sn ejecta .",
    "radiative - transfer simulations of sne  iin with bipolar csm support these expectations of having an asymmetric blue emission line arising from a bipolar geometry @xcite .",
    "a plausible interpretation is that a massive shell was ejected at these speeds and was initially seen in absorption , but as the underlying photosphere cooled ( as indicated by the spectral evolution during the decline from peak ) and as the optical depth dropped , the same dense shell is seen in h@xmath26 emission .",
    "this likely indicates ongoing shock heating of this ejected shell .",
    "the fact that the line is asymmetric at late times either requires that the mass ejection was intrinsically asymmetric with most of the mass ejected toward our observing direction , or that the receding side of the ejected shell is obscured by large amounts of dust that formed in the outflow .",
    "the large ir excess flux and fading of the optical source at late times are qualitatively consistent with copious dust formation in the ejecta .      in preceding sections , we noted a qualitative similarity between ngc4490-ot and galactic transient events that have been interpreted as stellar mergers : v1309  sco @xcite and v838 mon @xcite .",
    "the observed similarities apply to their somewhat irregular multi - peaked light curves , as well as to the morphology of their spectra .",
    "the comparison may extend to other proposed merger objects as well , such as v4332 sgr in 1994 @xcite , ogle 2002-blg-360 @xcite , m85 - 2006-ot1 @xcite , and m31  rv @xcite , although we did not discuss these in detail .",
    "ck  vul also had a multi - peaked light curve @xcite .",
    "the progenitor of ngc  4490-ot detected in pre - eruption _ hst _ data was a more massive star than either v838 mon or v1309 sco . based on our favoured value for the local reddening",
    ", we inferred that the progenitor could be quite similar to the lower - luminosity group of lbvs @xcite , with an effective initial mass of around 30 m@xmath2 .",
    "as noted earlier , ngc  4490-ot appears in a relatively isolated region of its host galaxy , similar to the lower - luminosity lbvs @xcite .",
    "if indeed ngc  4490-ot was a merger event , then it would appear to extend a correlation seen in the lower - mass mergers . based on a statistical analysis of published candidate merger events",
    ", @xcite suggested that there is a correlation between the progenitor s initial mass and the peak luminosity of the transient resulting from the putative merger .",
    "ngc  4490-ot seems to agree with this , since it had a more massive progenitor star than either v1309 sco and v838 mon , and also had a substantially higher peak luminosity .",
    "the initial mass is uncertain , but for 2030 m@xmath2 , this agrees reasonably well with the trend reported by @xcite .",
    "we note another possible correlation as well .",
    "in addition to a correlation between initial mass and transient peak luminosity , we note that there may be a correlation between both of these and the duration of the event .",
    "v838 mon had a longer duration than v1309  sco , and ngc  4490-ot had a significantly longer duration than v838  mon .",
    "there is a simple physical motivation for both of these trends .",
    "a merger event from more massive stars has more kinetic energy and angular momentum at the time of the merger , perhaps providing more thermal energy in the merger and a brighter transient event .",
    "similarly , more massive stars that merge must shed some fraction of their mass and angular momentum in the event . if more mass is ejected , the diffusion time is longer for the ejected envelope mass .",
    "interestingly , @xmath1 carinae would seem to extend these same trends , if it were considered as some sort of binary interaction event .",
    "it is a much more massive star , and the transient event was somewhat more luminous at peak and much longer lasting ( a decade ) than ngc  4490-ot .",
    "in fact , merger models have already been suggested as possible explanations for @xmath1 car s 19th century eruption @xcite , although these have the obvious difficulty of explaining why @xmath1 car also had multiple major eruptions in the past .",
    "grazing collisions at periastron have also been discussed as playing a role in the eruptions @xcite .",
    "the emitting photosphere during @xmath1 car s eruption was bigger than the current periastron separation , so some sort of violent interaction must have occurred @xcite , although whether this was a driving mechanism , a trigger , or merely an after - effect remains uncertain .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath1 car shares many of the observational hallmarks of the other stellar merger events : irregular multi - peaked light curve @xcite , transition to redder colours after peak @xcite , followed by dust formation and post - outburst obscuration @xcite .",
    "we have shown in this paper that published light - echo spectra of @xmath1  car @xcite also resemble our spectra of ngc  4490-ot and spectra of v838  mon at some epochs .",
    "the physical mechanism to power giant lbv eruptions is still not understood , but if stellar mergers or collisions are viable culprits , then it may be useful to consider them in context with low - mass stellar merger events as contributing to the pool of observed non - sn transient sources .",
    "lbvs may be the more massive extension of these other eruptive merger events , and that extension may be continuous .",
    "massive lbv stars are more rare , but in terms of triggering merger events in close binary systems , lbvs have the physical advantage that they can change their radius suddenly when they inflate as part of their s  doradus variability .",
    "this change may instigate mass transfer or a merger in a binary system that was previously not interacting . folding in selection effects , their higher mass and energy budgets , with higher peak luminosities and longer durations , may compensate for their relative rarity , to allow lbv mergers to make a significant contribution to observed extragalactic sn impostor statistics . in any case , if some or all giant lbv eruptions are indeed produced by merger or collision events , then it becomes more difficult to confidently classify sn impostors as lbvs , sn2008s - like objects , or something else .",
