    "in heavy ion collisions , much work is devoted to the study of the azimuthal distributions of outgoing particles , and in particular of distributions with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "since these distributions reflect the interactions between particles , possible anisotropies , the so - called `` flow , '' reveal information on the hot stages of the collision : thermalization , pressure gradients , time evolution , etc .",
    "@xcite    since the orientation of the reaction plane is not known _ a priori _ , flow measurements are usually extracted from two - particle azimuthal correlations .",
    "this is based on the idea that azimuthal correlations between two particles are generated by the correlation of the azimuth of each particle with the reaction plane .",
    "the assumption that this is the only source of two - particle azimuthal correlations , or at least that other sources can be neglected , dates back to the early days of the flow @xcite .",
    "it still underlies the analyses done at ultrarelativistic energies , both at the brookhaven ags and the cern sps .",
    "however , we have shown in recent papers  @xcite that other sources of azimuthal correlations ( which we refer to as `` nonflow '' correlations ) are of comparable magnitude and must be taken into account in the flow analysis .",
    "we have studied in detail the well - known correlations due to global momentum conservation  @xcite and those due to quantum correlations between identical particles  @xcite .",
    "we have also discussed other correlations due to resonance decays and final state interactions  @xcite .",
    "nonflow correlations scale with the total multiplicity @xmath1 like like @xmath2 .",
    "thus , they become large for peripheral collisions .",
    "it is important to take them into account , in particular , when studying the centrality dependence of the flow , which has been recently proposed as a sensitive probe of the phase transition to the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "clearly , a reliable flow analysis should eliminate nonflow correlations .",
    "correlations due to momentum conservation can be calculated analytically and subtracted from the measured correlations , so as to isolate the correlations due to flow  @xcite ; short range correlations can be measured independently and subtracted in the same way  @xcite .",
    "other well - identified nonflow correlations can be estimated through a monte - carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "this method was used by the wa93 collaboration to estimate direct correlations from @xmath3 decays  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can attempt to eliminate nonflow correlations directly at the experimental level : effects of momentum conservation cancel if the detector used in the flow analysis is symmetric with respect to midrapidity  @xcite ; short range correlations are eliminated if one correlates two subevents separated by a gap in rapidity .",
    "this is the method recently used by the star collaboration at rhic  @xcite . in the star paper ,",
    "the correlations between pions of the same charge are also compared with correlations between @xmath4 and @xmath5 : correlations from @xmath6 are thus found to be negligible .",
    "nevertheless , nonflow correlations remain which can not be handled so simply .",
    "correlations due to resonance decays , for instance , are hard to estimate ( this would require a detailed knowledge of the collision dynamics ) and there is no known systematic way to eliminate them at the experimental level ; more importantly , the production of minijets will contribute to azimuthal correlations in the experiments at higher energies , at rhic and lhc . finally , the existence of other sources of nonflow correlations , so far unknown , can not be excluded .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose a new method for the flow analysis which requires no knowledge of nonflow correlations .",
    "the general idea is to eliminate these latter using higher order azimuthal correlations .",
    "higher order correlations were previously used in  @xcite to show qualitatively the collectivity of flow .",
    "the study presented in this paper is more quantitative  : by means of a cumulant expansion , we are able to extract the value of the flow from multiparticle correlations .",
    "the method we propose is more reliable , and in many respects simpler than traditional methods  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "detector defects , which must be considered carefully when measuring anisotropies of a few percent , can be corrected in a compact and elegant way .    in sec .  [",
    "s : cumulants ] , we give the principle of our method as well as orders of magnitude .",
    "we show in particular that this method is more sensitive : it allows measurements of azimuthal anisotropies down to values of order @xmath7 , instead of @xmath0 with the standard analysis , where @xmath1 denotes the total multiplicity of particles emitted in the collision .",
    "then , we show how the method can be implemented practically . as usual",
    ", the measurement of azimuthal distributions is performed in two steps .",
    "first , one reconstructs approximately the orientation of the reaction plane from the directions of many emitted particles , and one estimates the statistical uncertainties associated with this reconstruction .",
    "in fact , this first step amounts to measuring the value of the flow , integrated over some region of phase space ( corresponding typically to a detector ) .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ s : integrated ] how this measurement can be done using moments of the distribution of the @xmath8-vector , which generalizes the transverse momentum transfer introduced by danielewicz and odyniec in order to estimate the azimuth of the reaction plane  @xcite .",
    "we also discuss an improved version of the subevent method introduced by the same authors to estimate the accuracy of the reaction plane reconstruction .",
    "the second step in the flow analysis is to perform more detailed measurements of azimuthal distributions , for various particles , as a function of rapidity and/or transverse momentum .",
    "we refer to these detailed measurements as to `` differential flow '' .",
    "they are usually performed by measuring distributions with respect to the reconstructed reaction plane , and then correcting for the statistical errors in this reconstruction , which have been estimated previously . here , the differential flow will be extracted directly from the correlation between the azimuths of the outgoing particles and the @xmath8-vector , as explained in sec .",
    "[ s : differential ] .",
    "the discussion applies so far to an ideal detector . a general way of implementing acceptance corrections adapted to our method is discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : acceptance ] . finally , the correct procedure is summarized in sec .",
    "[ s : summary ] .",
    "readers already familiar with flow analysis and willing to apply our method may go directly to this last section .",
    "as the standard methods of flow analysis  @xcite , our method is based on a fourier expansion of azimuthal distributions @xcite which is defined in sec .",
    "[ s : fourier ] .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ s : twoparticle ] , we discuss two - particle azimuthal correlations , on which the standard flow analysis relies , and show that they decompose into a contribution from flow and an additional term of order @xmath2 which corresponds to nonflow correlations ; this latter contribution limits the sensitivity of the traditional method . in sec .",
    "[ s : multiparticle ] , the decomposition is generalized to multiparticle correlations . finally , in sec .",
    "[ s : multiparticle2 ] , we show that this decomposition of multiparticle correlations allows us to obtain more sensitive measurements of flow .",
    "we call `` flow '' the azimuthal correlations between the outgoing particles and the reaction plane . these are conveniently characterized in terms of the fourier coefficients @xmath9  @xcite which we now define . in most of this paper",
    ", we shall work with a coordinate system in which the @xmath10 axis is the impact direction , and @xmath11 the reaction plane , while @xmath12 denotes the azimuthal angle with respect to the reaction plane . in this frame ,",
    "the momentum of a particle of mass @xmath13 is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the transverse momentum and @xmath16 the rapidity . since the orientation of the reaction plane is unknown in experiments , so is the azimuth @xmath12 .",
    "therefore @xmath17 and @xmath18 are not measured directly .",
    "when necessary , we shall denote by @xmath19 the azimuthal angle in the laboratory frame .",
    "unlike @xmath12 , @xmath19 is a measurable quantity , related to @xmath12 by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the unknown azimuthal angle of the reaction plane in the laboratory system .    with these definitions",
    ", @xmath9 can be expressed as a function of the one - particle momentum distribution @xmath22 @xmath23 where the brackets denote an average value over many events , and @xmath24 represents a phase space window in the @xmath25 plane where flow is measured , typically corresponding to a detector . since the particle source is symmetric with respect to the reaction plane for spherical nuclei , @xmath26 vanishes and @xmath9 is real .",
    "the purpose of the flow analysis is to extract @xmath9 from the data . only the first two coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "have been published .",
    "they are usually called directed and elliptic flow , respectively .",
    "there are so far very few measurements of higher order coefficients .",
    "the e877 experiment at the brookhaven ags reported values compatible with zero for @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "nonvanishing values of higher harmonics , up to @xmath31 , were reported from preliminary analyses at the cern sps @xcite",
    ". however , the latter results are likely to be strongly biased by quantum two - particle correlations @xcite . at the energies of the cern sps , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are of the order of a few percent @xcite , close to the limit of detectability with the standard methods , hence the need for a new , more sensitive method .",
    "since the actual orientation of the reaction plane is not known experimentally , one can only measure relative azimuthal angles between outgoing particles .",
    "the standard flow analysis relies on the measurement of two - particle azimuthal correlations , which involve the two - particle distribution @xmath32 : @xmath33 the standard analysis neglects nonflow correlations . under that assumption ,",
    "the two - particle momentum distribution factorizes : @xmath34 then , eqs .",
    "( [ vn ] ) and ( [ defcn ] ) give @xmath35 this equation means that the only azimuthal correlation between two particles results from their correlation with the reaction plane .",
    "measuring the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ flo1 ] ) in various phase space windows , one can then reconstruct @xmath9 from this equation , up to a global sign .",
    "for instance , the e877 collaboration uses the correlations between three rapidity windows to extract flow from their data  @xcite .    however , nonflow correlations do exist .",
    "the two - particle distribution can generally be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the correlated part of the distribution .",
    "there are various sources of such correlations , among which global momentum conservation , resonance decays ( in which the decay products are correlated ) , final state coulomb , strong or quantum interactions  @xcite .    in the coordinate system we have chosen , where the reaction plane is fixed , @xmath37 is typically of order @xmath2 relative to the uncorrelated part , where @xmath1 is the total number of particles emitted in the collision .",
    "this order of magnitude can easily be understood in the case of correlations between decay products , such as @xmath38 .",
    "a significant fraction of the pions produced in a heavy ion collision originate from this decay , and the conservation of energy and momentum in the decay gives rise to a large correlation between the reaction products . since a large number of @xmath39 mesons are produced in a high energy nucleus - nucleus collision ,",
    "the probability that two arbitrary pions originate from the same @xmath39 is of order @xmath2 .",
    "this @xmath2 scaling also holds for the correlation due to global momentum conservation  @xcite .",
    "inserting eq .",
    "( [ fc2 ] ) in expression ( [ defcn ] ) , one finds , instead of eq .",
    "( [ flo1 ] ) , @xmath40 the left - hand side represents the measured two - particle azimuthal correlation .",
    "the first term in the right - hand side is the contribution of flow to this correlation , while the second term @xmath41 denotes the contribution of the correlated part @xmath42 .",
    "the latter term corresponds to azimuthal correlations which do not arise from flow : we call them `` direct '' correlations , in opposition to the indirect correlations arising from the correlation with the reaction plane , that is , from flow .    since the correlated two - particle distribution @xmath43 is of order @xmath2 ,",
    "so is the second term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) , which therefore reads @xmath44 however , one must be careful with this order of magnitude .",
    "strictly speaking , it holds only when momenta are averaged over a large region of phase space . in the case of the short range correlations due to final state interactions ( coulomb , strong , quantum ) the correlations vanish as soon as the phase spaces @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the two particles are widely separated .",
    "this is the method used in  @xcite to get rid of such correlations . if , on the other hand , @xmath45 and @xmath46 coincide , the short range correlations are larger than expected from eq .",
    "( [ c2order ] ) : in this equation , the total number of emitted particles @xmath1 should be replaced by the number of particles @xmath47 used in the flow analysis , which is smaller in practice .",
    "furthermore , in the case of correlations due to the quantum ( hbt ) effect , the nonflow correlation scales like @xmath2 only if the source radius @xmath48 scales like @xmath49  @xcite . from now on",
    ", we shall omit the subscript @xmath24 for sake of brevity .",
    "note , however , that all the averages we shall consider are over a region of phase space which is not necessarily the whole space , but may be restricted to the @xmath25 acceptance of a detector .",
    "this will be especially important in sec .",
    "[ s : acceptance ] , when we discuss acceptance corrections .",
    "equation ( [ c2order ] ) shows that nonflow correlations can be neglected if @xmath50 . at sps energies ,",
    "the flow is weak and this condition is not fulfilled .",
    "indeed , we have shown  @xcite that the values of flow measured by the na49 collaboration at cern are considerably modified once nonflow correlations are taken into account .",
    "the failure of the standard analysis is due to the impossibility to separate the correlated part from the uncorrelated part in eq .",
    "( [ fc2 ] ) at the level of two - particle correlations .",
    "the main idea of this paper is to perform this separation using multiparticle correlations .",
    "the decomposition of the particle distribution into correlated and uncorrelated parts in eq .",
    "( [ fc2 ] ) can be generalized to an arbitrary number of particles .",
    "for instance , the three - particle distribution can be decomposed as @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "the last term @xmath53 corresponds to the genuine three - particle correlation , which is of order @xmath54 .    to understand this order of magnitude ,",
    "let us take a simple example : the @xmath55 meson decays mostly into three pions .",
    "first of all , this decay generates direct two - particle correlations : the relative momentum between any two of the outgoing pions is restricted by energy and momentum conservation .",
    "the corresponding correlation is of order @xmath2 as discussed previously in the case of @xmath38 decays .",
    "it corresponds to the second , third and fourth term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ fc3 ] ) .",
    "as stated above , the last term in this equation stands for the direct three - particle correlation .",
    "the corresponding correlation between the decay products of a given @xmath55 is of order unity , while the probability that three arbitrary pions come from the same @xmath55 scales with @xmath1 like @xmath54 .",
    "thus the correlation between three random pions is of order @xmath54 .    more generally , the decomposition of the @xmath56-particle distribution yields a correlated part @xmath57 of order @xmath58 .",
    "generalizing the above discussion of @xmath59 decay , the decay of a cluster of @xmath56 particles will generate correlations @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "for instance , momentum conservation , which is an effect involving all @xmath1 particles emitted in a collision , produces direct @xmath56-particle correlations for arbitrary @xmath56 .",
    "such a decomposition is similar to the cluster expansion which is well known in the theory of imperfect gases  @xcite . in the language of probability theory ,",
    "this is known as the cumulant expansion  @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ fc2 ] ) and ( [ fc3 ] ) can be represented diagrammatically by figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2p ] and [ fig : fig3p ] . in these figures ,",
    "correlated distributions @xmath42 are represented by enclosed sets of points , i.e.  they correspond to connected diagrams .    . ]",
    "relative to the first , while the three remaining terms are of relative order @xmath2 . ]    more generally , in order to decompose the @xmath56-point function @xmath62 , one first takes all possible partitions of the set of points @xmath63 .",
    "to each subset of points @xmath64 , one associates the corresponding correlated function @xmath65 .",
    "the contribution of a given partition is the product of the contributions of each subset .",
    "finally , @xmath62 is the sum of the contributions of all partitions .",
    "the equations expressing the @xmath56-point functions @xmath66 in terms of the correlated functions @xmath42 can be inverted order by order , so as to isolate the term of smallest magnitude : @xmath67    the cumulant expansion has been used previously in high energy physics to characterize multiparticle correlations : it has been applied to correlations in rapidity  @xcite and to bose - einstein quantum correlations  @xcite . in these studies , the interest was mainly in short range correlations .",
    "the use of higher order cumulants was therefore limited by statistics : the probability that three or more particles are very close in phase space is small . in this paper , we are interested in collective flow , which by definition produces a long range correlation , so that the limitation due to statistics is not so drastic .",
    "it will indeed be shown in sec .",
    "[ s : statistical ] that cumulants up to order 6 can be measured , depending on the event multiplicity and available statistics .",
    "we shall deal with multiparticle azimuthal correlations , which generalize the two - particle azimuthal correlations in eq .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) , and can be decomposed in the same way . referring to the diagrammatic representation in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2p ] and [ fig : fig3p ] , we shall name the contribution of @xmath68 to an azimuthal correlation , i.e.  the genuine @xmath56-particle correlation , the `` connected part '' of the correlation or , equivalently , the `` direct '' @xmath56-particle correlation .",
    "our method , which we now explain , allows the detection of small deviations from an isotropic distribution .",
    "if the source is isotropic , there is no flow , and the orientation of the reaction plane does not influence the particle distribution .",
    "we can therefore consider that the reaction plane has a fixed direction in the laboratory coordinate system , so that the cumulant expansion can be performed in that frame : in other terms , we replace @xmath12 by the measured azimuthal angle @xmath19 .",
    "one then measures the @xmath69 cumulant of the multiparticle azimuthal correlation , which is of order @xmath70 if the distribution is isotropic .",
    "flow will appear as a deviation from this expected behaviour .",
    "let us be more explicit .",
    "we are dealing with azimuthal correlations . when the source is isotropic , that is , if the @xmath56-particle distribution remains unchanged when all azimuthal angles are shifted by the same quantity @xmath71 , the flow coefficients ( [ vn ] ) obviously vanish",
    ". therefore , the two - particle azimuthal correlation ( [ c2 ] ) reduces to its connected part , of order @xmath2 . as a further consequence of isotropy , averages like @xmath72 vanish : only @xmath73-particle azimuthal correlations involving @xmath56 powers of @xmath74 and @xmath56 powers of @xmath75 are nonvanishing .",
    "for instance , the four - particle correlation @xmath76 is _ a priori _ non vanishing . introducing the cumulant expansion defined in sec .",
    "[ s : multiparticle ] , this correlation can be decomposed into @xmath77 note that most terms in the cumulant expansion disappear as a consequence of isotropy .",
    "the first two terms in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ c4 ] ) are products of direct two - particle correlations , and are therefore of order @xmath54 , while the last term , which corresponds to the direct four - particle correlation , is much smaller , of order @xmath78 . however , in the case of short range correlations , it may rather be of order @xmath79 , where @xmath47 is the number of particles used in the flow analysis , for the same reasons as discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : twoparticle ] .",
    "we name this latter term the `` cumulant '' to order 4 and denote it by @xmath80 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ c4 ] ) , it can be expressed as a function of the measured two- and four - particle azimuthal correlations : @xmath81 the reason why we introduce a new notation here is that the cumulant to order 4 will always be defined by ( [ defcumul4 ] ) in this paper , even when the source is not isotropic .",
    "now , if the source is not isotropic , the decomposition of the four - particle azimuthal correlation involves many terms which have been omitted in eq .",
    "( [ c4 ] ) ( see appendix [ s : app - c4c ] ) , so that the cumulant @xmath80 no longer corresponds to the connected part @xmath82 .",
    "in the isotropic case , the cumulant @xmath80 involves only direct four - particle correlations : the two - particle correlations have been eliminated in the subtraction . in order to illustrate this statement , let us consider two decays @xmath83 , and `` turn off '' all other sources of azimuthal correlations .",
    "we label 1 and 2 the pions emitted by the first resonance , 3 and 4 the pions emitted by the second .",
    "there are correlations between @xmath84 and @xmath85 , or between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , so that the measured four - particle correlation , i.e.  the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ c4 ] ) , does not vanish . however , there is no _ direct _ four - particle correlation between the four outgoing pions , so that the cumulant ( [ defcumul4 ] ) vanishes .",
    "more generally , if particles are produced in clusters of @xmath56 particles , there are measured azimuthal correlations to all orders , but the cumulants to order @xmath88 vanish .",

    "the flow @xmath9 can thus be obtained , up to a sign , from the measured two- and four - particle azimuthal correlations , with a better accuracy than when using only two - particle correlations , as we shall see shortly .",
