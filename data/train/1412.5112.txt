    "the canonical partition function @xmath1 of a @xmath2-particle system is expressed as a function of @xmath0 , the inverse of the temperature @xmath3 in units of @xmath4 , the boltzmann constant . for real @xmath0 , it is always positive , being a sum positive terms . for complex @xmath0 , however , the zeros come in complex conjugate pairs on the complex-@xmath0 plane . in the thermodynamic limit , these zeros coalesce into continuous curves .",
    "fisher  @xcite pointed out that in the event of a phase transition , the zeros pinch the positive real axis at a value of @xmath0 that corresponds to the transition temperature . in this paper , we first consider ideal bosons trapped in an isotropic harmonic oscillator .",
    "this ideal case was first studied by mlken _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who were interested in the order of the phase transition .",
    "our focus in this paper is on the changes in this pattern of fisher zeros when a strong attractive interaction between the atoms is introduced . in particular , does bec survive in this situation ?",
    "while the pattern of the fisher zeros of a unitary bose gas has not been studied earlier , a large number of papers have studied the stability of trapped bosons with attractive interaction  . for a bose gas , there is loss of atoms through three - body recombination : @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the number of three - body recombinations per unit volume per unit time is proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the scattering length , @xmath8 the number density of atoms , and @xmath9 is a dimensionless @xmath7-dependent constant . near unitary strength ,",
    "efimov trimers are formed , causing atomic losses that increase rapidly with increasing @xmath7 . the equilibration rate , however , scales as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the average speed .",
    "thus it would appear that the system would lose the atoms before equilibration .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite realized , however , that for a gas at unitarity , the scattering length drops out , and the only length scale is the average interparticle spacing , that goes like @xmath12 . invoking universality , the energy varies as @xmath13 , and the time scales like @xmath14 .",
    "the equilibration _ rate _ , as well as the loss _ rate _ of a unitary bose gas should both go like @xmath15 . which of these will dominate has to be determined experimentally .",
    "one is ignoring here the inhomogeniety of the gas due to initial trapping , and assuming the range of the force to be too small to be relevant .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite start with a bec condensate of @xmath16rb atoms far from feshbach resonance , and then adjust the magnetic field to rapidly attain the unitary limit .",
    "subsequently the gas is moved away from resonance , and allowed to evolve ballistically .",
    "they find that the gas equilibrates rapidly compared to the loss time .",
    "while they can not tell whether the bec survives in the unitary gas , they find the momentum distribution of the atoms to be remarkably similar to that of the ideal degenerate bose gas .",
    "their work demonstrates that the unitary bose gas can be prepared and dynamically investigated .",
    "recently piatecki and krauth  @xcite have performed a many - body monte - carlo calculation to describe the efimov - driven phase transition of a unitary bose gas .",
    "their hamiltonian not only consists of a two - body attractive zero - range potential , but also a three - body hard core cut - off in the hyper radial coordinate .",
    "this prevents a thomas collapse of the trimers .",
    "the bosons are trapped in an isotropic harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "the full equation of state consists of three phases : the unitary bose gas in the normal phase , a superfluid bose condensate , and a superfluid of efimov trimers .",
    "piatecki and krauth compute the equation of state in the gas phase numerically and in their fig .  2",
    "compare it with the theoretical result including the second and third virial coefficients .",
    "the agreement is good up to slightly above the bec transition temperature .",
    "the bose condensate at unitarity that they find is also robust , with the condensate temperature somewhat lower than the ideal case .",
    "we shall discuss this later after presenting our results .    in this paper , we consider the fisher zeros of both the ideal and the unitary bose gas .",
    "this requires the analytical form of the @xmath2-body canonical partition function @xmath1 .",
    "this is known exactly for the ideal bose gas through poperly defined temperature dependent statistical virial coefficients ( sect 3.1 ) .",
    "for the ideal gas , taking into account a large number of statistical virial coefficients , both sides of the peak of the heat capacity at @xmath17 are clearly obtained .",
    "this suggests that the virial expansion , with proper temperature dependence retained , is applicable deep in the degenerate regime .",
    "unfortunately we can not follow the same procedure in detail for the unitary gas since only the second virial coefficient is known analytically .",
    "the third virial coefficient for a homogeneous gas has been calculated in @xcite by castin and werner .",
    "however , it involves three - body efimovian parameters in an essential way , and is given analytically only at the low- and high - temperature ends . excluding the third and higher virial coefficients",
    "is a limitation of our approach , since we do not expect the condensate temperature to be accurately described then .",
    "nevertheless , we shall see how the pattern of the fisher zeros changes due to the interaction at the two - body cluster level with a corresponding shift in the condensation temperature .",
    "this description allows us to see if bec survives the strong attractive interaction at unitarity .",
    "our calculation of the pattern of fisher zeros qualitatively suggests that bec survives at unitarity , and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of the fisher zeros of an ideal bose gas .",
    "since we do not include the third virial coefficient , we have no knowledge of the efimov driven transition .",
    "it should be noted that in a discussion of a unitary fermion gas  @xcite it is shown that a high - temperature virial expansion can match the equation of state over a large range of fugacity , but not all the way to the superfluid phase . in this paper",
    "we explore similar behaviour for bec by studying the fisher zeros .",
    "the notion of unitarity in lower spatial dimensions have been examined castin and werner  @xcite , and by how and leclair  @xcite . for one - dimensional bosons , modelling the interaction by a delta function interaction @xmath18 , unitarity",
    "may be defined by the @xmath19-matrix being equal to @xmath20 , and is obtained by @xmath21 .",
    "this impenetrable bose gas is equivalent to a spinless free fermi gas  @xcite . in two dimensions",
    ", unitarity may be defined by the scattering length @xmath22 , but this maps onto the free space problem .",

    "@xcite it was shown that long wavelength fluctuations are suppressed by the ho trap , and bec is well defined for a zero - range repulsive interaction .",
    "the canonical partition function ( for fixed @xmath2 ) is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the complete set of eigenenergies of the @xmath2-body system including states in the continuum , if any .",
    "the sum is taken over all states @xmath25 including the degenerate ones . since the energies @xmath24 depend on the volume of the system , there is a volume dependence in @xmath1 . to appreciate the connection between complex zeros near the real axis to critical fluctuations at phase transition ,",
    "let us consider the canonical partition function @xmath1 on the complex-@xmath0 plane .",
    "this may be written as a product of @xmath26 with no complex zeros and factors explicitly showing the zeros , @xmath27 for finite boson number @xmath2 , the index @xmath28 runs over a finite number @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is much larger than @xmath2 .",
    "the pairs of complex conjugate zeros ensures that the partition function remains real on the real-@xmath0 axis . knowing the distribution of zeros , one may , in principle , calculate the thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "the grand canonical partition function , on the other hand , allows for particle exchange ( in addition to energy ) via the reservoir , and is defined as @xmath31 where the fugacity @xmath32 and @xmath33 is defined to be one .",

    "this is the exact quantum @xmath36 .",

    "for an ideal boson gas , @xmath1 may be obtained from @xmath36 using a recursion relation  @xcite . for bosons , @xmath42 where @xmath43 . using the recursion relation above , @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , @xmath45 is expressed in terms of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and so on .",
    "typically , in a magnetic trap , @xmath2 is very large , of the order of @xmath48cc or larger for an oscillator with @xmath49 nk . for our calculation , it is impractical to take such large @xmath2 in the recursion relation . theoretically , for harmonically trapped bosons , bec is manifest even for a small number of bosons  @xcite , though the transition temperature is not so sharp .",
    "so far as fisher zeros are concerned , they still approach the real-@xmath0 axis , but stop short of it ( see fig .  [ fig:01 ] ) .",
    "it is also straightforward to include the effect of interaction in the unitary gas at temperatures spanning the degenerate regime , as was done for the fermionic gas in @xcite .",

    "since @xmath72 is a polynomial the number of zeros is equal to its degree which increases rapidly with particle number .",
    "for example , for @xmath75 ideal bosons , there are 3495 zeros .",
    "we determine a subset to give a clear indication that the pattern of zeros pinches the positive real @xmath0 axis . for the continuum approximation , by contrast",
