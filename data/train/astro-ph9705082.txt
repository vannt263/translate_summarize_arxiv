    "in practice the third condition had little impact on the coronal emission lines .",
    "the plane parallel condition was invoked to avoid clouds whose dimensions rival their distances from the central source , thus avoiding a significant covering fraction by a single cloud .",

    "given the assumptions above , the emission from 1,881 individual clouds has been computed as a function of the cloud distance from the ionizing source , @xmath21 ( cm ) , and the hydrogen number density of the cloud , log @xmath22 ( @xmath4 ) .",

    "note that this scaling with observed luminosity assumes that the continuum is emitted isotropically , which may not be the case in nature .",
    "recent observations have shown emission line `` cones '' ( evans et al .",

    "this `` beaming '' of the incident continuum , which the clouds see and we may not , will change the effective luminosity incident on the clouds and adjust the distances presented below .",
    "contour plots of emission line equivalent width , referred to the incident continuum at 4860   , as a function of @xmath21 and @xmath28 for 24 high ionization forbidden lines are shown in figures  14 .",
    "this equivalent width assumes 100% source coverage by the emitting clouds .",
    "we show those lines that are either expected to be strong and/or observationally important .",
    "the emission line equivalent width distributions are plotted in order of increasing atomic number , then increasing ionization stage for each element , and indicate the efficiency of continuum reprocessing .    for each emission line in figures  14 ,",
    "a ridge of near maximum equivalent width runs diagonally across the distance  gas density plane , roughly parallel to lines of constant ionization parameter .",
    "the ionization parameter , @xmath29 , is defined as the ratio of ionizing photon density to hydrogen density , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the flux of ionizing photons and @xmath32 is the speed of light .",
    "this parameter increases from top right to bottom left in these diagrams , and @xmath33 is plotted as a dashed line for each emission line as a reference .",
    "this ridge of near maximum equivalent width coincides with a small range in optimal ionization parameter . for larger ( smaller ) ionization parameters",
    "the gas is over ( under ) ionized , and the line is not efficiently emitted .",
    "this explains the sudden drops in the emission line equivalent widths on either side of their ridges .",
    "the asymmetric drop of emission on either side of the ridges is explained by the differing physical conditions of the gas on either side of the ridges and by our assumption of plane parallel clouds ( @xmath122.2 ) .",
    "the latter has the effect of truncating the emission of some of the `` lower ionization '' coronal lines , such as [ ] , at high ionization parameter where they would otherwise form on the back sides of the clouds . in the absence of this truncation",
    ", the ridges of optimal emission would broaden slightly in the direction of higher ionization parameter .",
    "the effect on the higher ionization coronal lines is minimal since these lines generally form in a thin zone on the side of the cloud facing the ionizing source .",
    "moving _ along _ the ridge to increasing gas densities , at near constant ionization parameter , the forbidden lines become collisionally deexcited and the line equivalent width falls off .",
    "compare , for example , in figures  1a , b , the near - uv and infrared transitions of [ ] . moving along the ridge at constant ionization parameter to smaller gas densities ,",
    "the equivalent widths of some lines also diminish as other lines of similar ionization , but lower critical density , become important coolants .",
    "these contour plots represent `` visibility functions '' for the coronal lines .    in table",
    "1 we give the ionization parameter at the peak equivalent width ( column  3 ) , the range in @xmath34 for the top contour ( column  4 ) of each line considered in figures  1  4 .",
    "together these parameters describe the optimal conditions in which these lines form .",
    "note that a range in gas density for a given ionization parameter indicates a range of expected distances from the central source for @xmath13 ergs  s@xmath27 , given in column  5 of table  1 .",
    "we emphasize that these distance ranges are not _ necessarily _ those for which the coronal lines should be most luminous in seyfert galaxies . for example , we do not expect a substantial contribution of coronal line emission from the broad emission line region .",
    "rather , column  5 is meant to illustrate the relative differences in the coronal line formation distances . in column  6",
    "we give the @xmath35 ( k ) of the front face of the cloud whose ionization parameter is given in column  3 .",
    "this temperature is representative of that in which the line in column  1 is emitted .",
    "column  7 lists the peak equivalent width of each line , as indicated in figure  1 .",
    "since this equivalent width is referenced to the same point in the incident continuum , a comparison should grossly indicate the expected relative strengths of these lines , though this is not meant to represent a predicted coronal emission line spectrum that is outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "pier & voit ( 1995 ) hypothesized that the coronal line emission comes from a thin , highly ionized `` skin '' just above the surface of the `` obscuring '' molecular torus which is undergoing evaporation from an x - ray heated wind generated by the central continuum source . in this model , the grains are not destroyed until they are sputtered in the @xmath36  k wind , with some destruction possible in the coronal line emitting gas just below the wind .",
    "however , their predicted coronal line spectrum assumed solar abundances and did not take into account gas phase depletions onto grains ( pier 1995 ) . in this section",
    "we demonstrate the full effects of the presence of grains in a more general coronal line emitting environment .",
    "there are three major effects of dust on line formation : ( 1 ) the emission lines weaken due to absorption of the incident continuum by dust at large @xmath29 , ( 2 ) the grains photoelectrically heat the gas , and ( 3 ) some of the gas - phase elements are depleted .",
    "the destruction of the coronal line photons by grains is included but not important since the line and ir continuum optical depths are small , in comparison to the resonance lines which are readily destroyed by grains .",
    "we include dust of the type found in the orion nebula ( baldwin et al .",
    "1991 ) in grid calculations at radii consistent with the sublimation temperatures of the silicate and graphite grains discussed by laor & draine ( 1993 ) and netzer & laor ( 1993 ) . in particular , inside the graphite grain boundary the gas had solar abundances and no grains were present .",

    "o / h and c / h are also depressed , their abundances being 54% and 85% solar , respectively .",
    "how much of these differences from solar are due to depletions onto grains or due to intrinsic abundance differences is unknown and is an area of active research ( e.g. , snow & witt 1996 ) .",
    "since carbon and oxygen do much of the line cooling , some differences in the cloud thermal structure and emission will result , independent of the effects of the grains themselves .",

    "we show the equivalent width contours of six coronal lines formed in the presence of dust , as described above .",
    "these lines should be compared to their solar abundance , dust - free gas counterparts in figures  1  4 .",
    "a comparison of figure  5f with 4f ( [ ] @xmath85303 ) illustrates most dramatically the effects on the line emission . at radii",
    "smaller than @xmath37  cm , grains are not present and the contours shown in figure  5f are exactly those shown in figure  4f .",
    "for radii just outside this graphite grain sublimation boundary , iron is not depleted , but a significant decline in the line equivalent width ( factor of @xmath41 ) occurs due to the first effect , mentioned above .",
    "this line s equivalent width again falls rapidly just beyond the silicate grain sublimation radius ( another factor of @xmath42 ) . at these larger",
    "radii many of the elements , including iron , are depleted onto grains .",
    "some of the more refractory elements and their orion depletion factors are mg(12 ) , si(12 ) , ca(115 ) , fe(11 ) . note that these depletions are less severe than in the local ism , and could in part represent grain destruction in the ionized gas ( rubin et al .  1992a , b ) .",
    "mainly because of its extreme depletion in a dusty environment , the emission lines of ca are devastated .",
    "( figure  5e ) .",
    "the peak equivalent width contours of [ ] 3.03@xmath11 m , [ ] 1.43@xmath11 m , and [ ] 2.32@xmath11 m in figure  5 have smaller values and have moved to smaller radii along their ridges , where the effects of grains are smaller or absent .",
    "the effects of the presence of grains on the emission of [ ] @xmath83426 and [ ] 7.65@xmath11 m are more subtle .",
    "neon , a noble gas , is not depleted and these lines are emitted almost entirely outside the grain sublimation radii .",
    "these lines suffered declines in their peak equivalent widths of factors of 2 and 3 , respectively , and their ridges shifted to lower ionization parameters where the grain / gas opacity ratio is smaller .",
    "this effect is not as important for these two lines , compared to the others in figure  5 , since they form at smaller ionization parameters .",
    "figures  1  5 and column 5 of table 1 show that the lower ionization coronal lines form in regions outside the dust sublimation radii , while the higher ionization coronal lines form in regions which straddle these radii .",
    "given the severe reduction in many of the coronal line intensities in a dusty environment , the observed strengths of the coronal emission lines indicate that they are formed in dust - free , or nearly so , gas .",
    "the observations in several seyfert galaxies of significant [ ] 2.32@xmath11 m emission relative to [ ] @xmath83426 and [ ] 2.48@xmath11 m , all formed mainly outside the sublimation radii ( oliva et al .  1994 ; marconi et al .",
    "1996 ) would by itself seem to exclude the possibility of the existence of dust within the coronal line gas .",
    "we elaborate further on this , below .",
    "the coronal lines shown in figure  1 form in gas that has typical ionization parameters @xmath43 and gas densities @xmath44 ( @xmath4 ) and temperatures @xmath5 12,000 k  150,000 k. this corresponds to distances from the ionizing source of approximately the broad line region to 400  pc ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this upper limit on the distance could be larger if lower density gas is present , but this gas would have a smaller surface brightness .",
    "it is interesting to note that the lower ionization coronal lines , [ ] to [ ] and also [ ] and [ ] form most efficiently in gas that is roughly @xmath510  pc and beyond , and thus their emission may be extended in nearby seyfert galaxies ( korista & ferland 1989 ) .",
    "the rest of the lines in table  1 optimally form in gas less than 10  pc from the ionizing source",
    ". looking at table  1 we expect that [ ] @xmath86087 and [ ] @xmath85303 form in completely different gas . for comparison [ ] @xmath85007",
    "is expected to form in gas at distances of several parsecs to @xmath45  kpc .",
    "if there is a relatively simple relation between the cloud distance and its velocity , then one might expect to find observationally a relationship between the width of the line and its ionization potential and/or critical density ; the latter two are related .",
    "such relationships have been observed amongst the optical forbidden lines ( e.g. , filippenko & halpern 1984 ; derobertis & osterbrock 1984 , 1986 ) . based on figures  1a and 1b and columns 3",
    " 5 in table  1 , one might expect that the infrared [ ] 14.3,24.3  @xmath11 m lines would be primarily emitted in gas of very different properties than that of the [ ] @xmath8@xmath83426,3346 lines , _ even though they arise from the same ion_. the near - uv line profiles are likely to be significantly broader than their infrared counterparts . to our knowledge",
    "the infrared lines of [ ] have not been reported for seyfert galaxies , but should be observed with iso .",
    "the equivalent widths of the coronal lines should serve as an effective zanstra temperature ( zanstra 1931 ; osterbrock 1989 ) of the relevant ionizing continuum ( @xmath46  kev ) .",
    "in @xmath122.2 we assumed a fairly hard continuum incident on the coronal line clouds .",
    "decreasing the coronal ionizing photon flux , @xmath47(0.1  0.5  kev ) , by a factor of 10 will decrease the equivalent width of the higher ionization lines , such as [ ] and [ ] , by factors of 10 and 20 , and the lower ionization lines , such as [ ] , by factors of 2  3 .",
    "a more subtle effect of the shape of the ionizing spectrum is that the formation distances of especially the highest ionization coronal lines ( column  5 of table  1 ) will shift to smaller ( larger ) values for significantly softer ( harder ) spectra , due to changes in the thermal / ionization balance in the clouds . in the example of the diminished @xmath47(0.1  0.5  kev ) , above , the formation distances in column  5 of table  1 would be @xmath5  2 times smaller for the highest ionization lines ( e.g. , [ ] @xmath86375 and [ ] @xmath85303 ) , while the effects on lines such as [ ] and [ ] would be much smaller",
    ". many of the highest ionization lines might be invisible , too .",
    "nussbaumer & osterbrock ( 1970 ) suggested using the [ ] @xmath86087 / [ ] @xmath83426 ratio to measure the fe / ne abundance . in principle",
    "this would be a good ratio , if the two lines are formed in the same gas , since neon is not expected to be depleted when grains are present . however , a glance at table  1 and figures  1a and 4c shows that these lines generally do not form in the same gas . in this section",
    "we discuss a few coronal line ratios which should prove to be reliable gas abundance indicators",
    ".    the ratios of emission lines forming in gas with the same physical conditions , i.e. gas density , temperature and ionization , will be good relative abundance indicators . considering figures  1  4 and table  1 , we have identified several pairs of lines that form in similar physical conditions .",
    "their ridges of peak equivalent widths overlie one another , and their ratio should be nearly flat in the gas density  source distance plane .",
    "figure  6 shows the best example of line ratios that overlap well in the gas density ",
    "source distance plane . the ratio [ ] 2.32@xmath11m/ [ ] 2.48@xmath11 m has a nearly flat plateau , with a linear value between 1.4 and 1.5 for solar gas abundances , though values as small as 1 are possible in some gas where the two lines are strong .",
    "table  2 summarizes the eight most reliable abundance indicators from considering table  1 .",
    "column ( 2 ) of the table gives the value of the plateau of the line ratio . for two of the ratios , [ ] / [ ] , and [ ] / [ ]",
    ", the plateau was fairly flat due to the ridges of the individual lines overlapping well , with errors of @xmath5  30%  40% .",
    "however , the other ratios were not as well behaved and the plateau value is only known to a factor of two indicating the sensitivity to the line formation conditions . the observed line ratios , if any , are given in column ( 3 ) for two seyfert galaxies , and the solar abundance ratio is in column ( 4 ) .    from table  2 we see that the ratio of [ ] / [ ] is predicted , with solar abundances , to be 23 times that of the observed value . taking the observed ratios at face value , either calcium is underabundant relative to silicon by a factor of two , or the reverse , silicon is overabundant relative to calcium compared to solar .",
    "this is nowhere near the factor of 13 underabundance of calcium relative to silicon in the orion nebula ( rubin et al .",
    "1992a , b ) , or the factor of 225 in the local ism ( snow & witt 1996 ) , supporting our earlier statement ( @xmath12  2.4 ) that the coronal line emitting gas is dust free .",
    "this has important implications for the origin of the coronal line gas , as well as the `` classical '' narrow emission line gas since there must be some spatial overlap .",
    "are the narrow line region clouds dusty throughout ? does the sublimation of dust demarcate the narrow and broad emission line regions ( netzer & laor 1993 ) ? if the source of gas for the coronal lines is dusty ( e.g. , molecular clouds or torus ) , how are the grains destroyed in the emitting region ?",
    "the electron temperatures at the front faces of the coronal line emitting clouds range from @xmath5  12,000  k  150,000  k , and the destruction of grains due to sputtering is probably unimportant , except on long time scales ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) .",
    "however , some mechanism must be responsible for the destruction of most of the dust in the coronal line emitting gas .",
    "oliva et al .  ( 1996 ) highlighted the sensitivity of the collision strengths to the presence and position of resonances in the collisional cross sections .",
    "the collision strengths of [ ] and [ ] are now more than an order of magnitude larger than those used in korista & ferland ( 1989 ) which did not include the effects of resonances ( mason 1975 )",
    ". however , even some of the recent calculations which include resonances differ significantly in their resulting collision strengths . for example , the most recently computed collision strengths of [ ] and [ ] have differed by factors of 3  10 ( mohan , hibbert , & kingston 1994 ; pelan & berrington 1995 ; dufton & kingston 1991 ; storey , mason , & saraph 1996 ) .",
    "no collision strengths which include resonances have been calculated for [ ] , and those which do for [ ] ( keenan & norrington 1987 ) may be in doubt .",
    "preliminary analysis ( see also column  7 of table  1 ) indicates that if the most recent collision strengths for [ ] and [ ] are correct ( pelan & berrington ; storey et al . ) , then the iron abundance would have to be arbitrarily depleted relative to the other elements ( e.g. , mg , si , ca ) by more than a factor of @xmath48 compared to solar , which does not make sense . the alternative is that the [ ] and [ ] collision strengths are too strong by a similar factor .",
    "hopefully , these issues will be resolved in the future .",
    "the line ratios involving fe are currently uncertain , but these and the relative abundance ratios should scale roughly with changes in the iron lines collision strengths .",
    "using a large number of photoionization simulations we have illustrated the physical conditions ( gas density and distance from the ionizing source ) in which the coronal emission lines in seyfert galaxy spectra form .",
    "we find that the observations of significant emission from ions of refractive elements such as calcium and iron likely excludes the presence of dust grains in the coronal line emitting gas .",
    "the lower ionization coronal lines ( e.g. , [ ] , [ ] ) are likely to form in lower density gas which should be spatially extended in nearby seyfert galaxies , whereas the highest ionization lines ( e.g. , [ ] , [ ] ) are likely to form in higher density gas in more compact regions .",
