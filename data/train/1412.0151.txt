    "this is different from a conventional rashba coupling where momenta along both directions of the surface would appear . presumably , this has mostly quantitative consequences as it is the momentum along the chain which is essential for allowing induced @xmath25-wave pairing in the adatom band .",
    "we finally note that one may also want to include pairing correlations @xmath182 in the mean field approximation for the hubbard interaction on the adatom sites .",

    "<S> these include topological insulators @xcite , semiconductor quantum wires @xcite , and chains of magnetic adatoms @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> all these proposals are being actively pursued in the laboratory @xcite .    a recent experiment @xcite exhibits signatures of majorana bound states in chains of fe atoms placed on a pb surface . </S>",
    "<S> experiment suggests that the fe chain orders ferromagnetically . </S>",
    "<S> the subgap spectrum is probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy with both spatial and spectral resolution which shows zero - energy states near the ends of the chains . </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to interpret these as majorana bound states @xcite as the system combines the three essential ingredients : ( i ) proximity - induced superconductivity ; ( ii ) a finite zeeman splitting due to the exchange field of the ferromagnetic fe chains ; and ( iii ) rashba spin - orbit ( so ) coupling ( presumably from the surface of the pb substrate ) .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the observed localization of the end states on the scale of a few adatom sites is puzzling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the majorana localization length is typically estimated as @xmath1 , while the coherence length @xmath2 of the proximity - providing sc is given by @xmath3 . here , we assume comparable fermi velocities @xmath4 in the one - dimensional electron system ( ` wire ' ) and the host sc . at the same time , the induced topological gap @xmath5 is smaller than the host gap @xmath6 . </S>",

    "<S> this contrasts with the observation that the localization length of the end states is orders of magnitude smaller than the coherence length of pb . </S>",
    "<S> here we address this puzzle by modeling the adatoms as a chain of anderson impurities hybridized with a sc and show that it predicts majorana localization lengths which are parametrically smaller than @xmath2 over wide regions of parameter space .    </S>",
    "<S> the physics underlying the topological phase in chains of magnetic adatoms has been discussed in two approaches . </S>",
    "<S> one approach @xcite starts with the subgap shiba states @xcite induced by the individual magnetic adatoms . </S>",

    "<S> an alternative approach @xcite starts with exchange - split adatom states . </S>",
    "<S> while they are far from the fermi energy for individual adatoms , hopping between the adatoms of the chain broadens these states into bands . for sufficiently strong </S>",
    "<S> hopping , these bands cross the fermi energy and effectively realize a one - dimensional spin - polarized electron system . in this band limit , topological superconductivity is induced by proximity , in combination with so coupling for ferromagnetic chains or helical magnetic order along the chain . as an additional benefit , our model unifies both of these approaches .    _ </S>",
    "<S> heuristic considerations._we start by discussing conventional proximity coupling of a free - electron ` wire ' to a bulk @xmath0-wave sc . </S>",
    "<S> the ` wire ' electrons are described by their green function @xmath8^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath9 denote pauli matrices in particle - hole space . </S>",

    "<S> , the sc behaves as a normal metal and the escape of electrons into the bulk sc is described by @xmath14 . for subgap energies , </S>",
    "<S> electrons enter the sc only virtually and @xmath10 becomes real .    for definiteness , </S>",

    "<S> then , we can approximate @xmath16 , and @xmath17^{-1}$ ] with a renormalized quasiparticle weight @xmath18^{-1}$ ] , which describes the shift of the electrons spectral weight from the wire into the sc . </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle weight ensures @xcite that the induced @xmath0-wave gap ( described by the pairing term @xmath19 ) interpolates between the hybridization strength @xmath12 at weak hybridization , @xmath20 , and the host gap @xmath6 at strong hybridization , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> it also renormalizes the fermi velocity @xmath22 which controls the coherence length of the induced superconductivity in the wire . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the fraction of time an excitation spends in the wire is suppressed by @xmath23 , which reduces the effective velocity to @xmath24 .    in adatom chains , </S>",
    "<S> the so coupling in the sc allows for induced @xmath25-wave pairing while the strong on - site repulsion and resulting spin polarization suppress @xmath0-wave correlations . </S>",
