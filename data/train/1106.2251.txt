    "detection of a significant number of exoplanets orbiting sun - like stars ( fgk dwarfs ) has helped us to improve our understanding of the origins and diversity of planetary systems .",
    "statistics on detected planets suggests the presence of several different populations and correlations . that has motivated theorists to synthesize planet populations by integrating the formation process from planetesimals to planets @xcite .",
    "comparison with statistical properties from observations has then enabled us to calibrate theories for planet formation .    as for heavier stars such as ba dwarfs ,",
    "the situation is somewhat different .",
    "precise radial - velocity measurement is not successful , because of the lack in absorption lines on their hot photospheric surfaces .",
    "instead , efforts have been made to find planets around gk giants that used to be ba dwarfs on their main - sequence .",
    "thus , comparison between observations and theories is not straightforward , unlike in the case of fgk dwarfs .",
    "that means we have to take into account modifications to orbital configurations of planets during their host stars evolution .",
    "according to recent radial - velocity surveys for gk clump giants , it appears that there is a lack of giant planets inside 0.6  au ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "such a deficit is not seen around sun - like stars which often harbor short - period planets such as hot jupiters .",
    "it is unclear whether the deficit is primordial  namely , short - period giant planets ( spgps ) are not formed around ba dwarfs originally ; otherwise short - period planets are removed during host stars evolution . the latter possibility is focused on in this paper .",
    "a star evolves off the main sequence ( ms ) towards the red - giant branch ( rgb ) , after exhaustion of hydrogen at its center .",
    "then , once the helium ignites , the star enters a next central nuclear burning phase that is sometimes called the helium - burning phase ( heb ) .",
    "most of the clump giants with detected planets are thought to be on their heb . before reaching the heb ,",
    "namely , in the rgb phase , the star expands substantially , becomes highly luminous , and may lose substantial mass , which should affect orbits of surrounding planets .",
    "the evolution and fate of planets in the rgb phase of their host stars have been investigated in the context of the survival of the earth . based on his simple estimation , @xcite , followed by a somewhat detailed argument by @xcite",
    ", showed that the earth would lose its momentum quickly in the extending envelope of the sun before the envelope starts to shrink again .",
    "that means the earth would be unable to escape from the sun once engulfed .",
    "those studies suggest the need for the detailed simulation of the sun s evolution .",
    "the sun s evolution , including solar mass loss , was simulated in detail by @xcite , who demonstrated that the decrease in the solar mass is effective in pushing the terrestrial planets other than mercury outwards and preventing them from being engulfed by the expanded sun .",
    "later , building on theories for formation of close binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite incorporated the tide raised on the sun and then demonstrated that venus is likely to fall into the sun because of the solar tide enhanced by the expansion of the envelope , while the earth s fate remained inconclusive , depending on unconstrained parameters for tide .",
    "other effects such as the gravitational drag , ram pressure , wind - accretion @xcite , and orbital instability due to secular perturbation @xcite are known to be negligible .",
    "note that the last possibility could be important in extrasolar planetary systems , depending on orbital configurations .    to understand the observed lack of spgps around gk clump giants , @xcite and @xcite investigated the orbital evolution of planets around intermediate - mass rgb stars in a similar way to @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that spgps did undergo orbital decay due to stellar tide , ending up being swallowed by their host stars .",
    "in particular , @xcite derived a critical semimajor axis , @xmath4 ( note that they called it a minimum semimajor axis and denoted it by @xmath5 ) , beyond which planets evade engulfment by their host stars during the rgb phase : in four cases of different stellar initial masses , @xmath6 ( i.e. , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5  @xmath1 ) , the values of @xmath4 that they derived for jovian - mass planets were 3.0 , 2.1 , 0.18 , and 0.45  au , respectively .",
    "then , without detailed comparison of @xmath4 with the orbital distribution of known planets around gk clump giants , they concluded that engulfment by host stars may be responsible for the observed lack of spgps inside 0.6  au and any ad hoc mechanism to never make spgps may not be required .    in this paper , to verify the planet - engulfment hypothesis",
    ", we make a detailed comparison of the theoretical limit of survival ( namely , @xmath4 ) with semimajor axes of the planets detected so far around gk clump giants .",
    "the mass of those giants ranges from @xmath7 and @xmath8  @xmath1 . as known in the study of stellar evolution ( e.g. ,",
    "* ) , the rgb - tip radius is sensitive to stellar mass in such a range . given that stellar tide depends strongly on stellar radius ( see section [ sec : method ] ) , the limit of survival from engulfment by host stars should be sensitive to host stars mass , which implies the need for detailed comparison between the theoretical and observational limits .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite has recently made a thorough study of the tidal evolution of orbits of planets around post - ms stars .",
    "their focus was , however , on planets around white dwarfs that survive engulfment by agb stars .",
    "of interest in this paper is planets around rgb or heb stars that have not entered the agb phase yet .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : method ] , we first describe our physical model and computation method to simulate the orbital evolution of a planet around its host star that is evolving off the ms . in section  [ sec : results ] , we derive a critical semimajor axis beyond which planets survive the host stars rgb / heb phase , and investigate its sensitivity to stellar mass and other parameters . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we compare the derived survival limit with measured semimajor axes of the detected planets .",
    "the comparison suggests that planet engulfment may not be the main reason for the observed paucity of spgps , apart from statistical sufficiency",
    ". in section  [ sec : validity ] , we evaluate the impacts of several uncertainties on the survival limit and find that our conclusion is not affected by them . in section  [ sec : primordial ] ,",
    "we mention the possibility of stellar - mass - dependent formation process that may account for the observed paucity of spgps .",
    "finally , we summarize this paper , claiming the need for more planet samples around giants of @xmath9 to confirm the validity of our findings , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we simulate the evolution of orbits of planets during host stars evolution .",
    "we assume circular orbits , because our focus is on semimajor axis in this study .",
    "the eccentricities of planets detected around the gk clump giants that we target in this study are as small as 0.25 .",
    "such a small eccentricity has a small effect on the evolution of semimajor axis .",
    "the impact of the finite eccentricity on the limit of survival is evaluated in section  [ sec : e ] .",
    "note that previous studies @xcite also assumed zero eccentriticies .",
    "we consider the effects of stellar tide and mass loss on the planetary orbit .",
    "we neglect other competing processes such as the frictional and gravitational drag forces by stellar wind and change in the planet mass due to stellar - wind accretion and evaporation , which were evaluated to be negligible by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus , we integrate the equation , @xmath10 from the zero - age main - sequence of the host star of a given mass . in the above equation",
    ", @xmath11 is the semimajor axis , @xmath12 is time , @xmath13 is the planet s mass , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the mass and radius of the host star , respectively , @xmath16 is the apsidal motion constant , and @xmath17 is the eddy turnover timescale ( see below ) .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side represents the effect of stellar tide @xcite . since rgb stars are slow rotators , we assume no stellar rotation , which means that the stellar tide always causes orbital decay of the planet .",
    "as for the parameters for stellar tide such as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , following @xcite and @xcite , we adopt the turbulent viscosity : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass in the convective envelope and @xmath20 is given by @xmath21       \\label{eq : f}\\ ] ] with @xmath22 being the orbital period .",

    "the factor @xmath20 is introduced to weaken the stellar tide when the orbital period is shorter than the eddy turnover timescale .",
    "however , it is a matter of debate how to deal with such fast tide ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we discuss the impact of the uncertainties in @xmath20 on the survival limit in section  [ sec : tidal model ] .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : orbit ] ) represents orbital migration due to stellar mass loss ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we use the reimers parameterisation for stellar mass loss @xcite , namely , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mass - loss parameter of order unity .    in this study , we simulate stellar evolution directly with the code mesa ver .",
    "2258 @xcite to calculate @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "we adopt the mass - loss parameter @xmath35 and the mixing - length parameter @xmath36 .",
    "we include the effects of convective overshooting , following the mesa s prescription where the overshoot parameters are set to be 0.0128 at the bottom of non - burn regions and 0.014 at all the other boundaries .",
    "several different stellar - evolution models that are simulated with different numerical codes are available in the literature and online .",
    "@xcite used a stellar - evolution code other than mesa .",
    "we discuss the differences and their impacts on the survival limit in section  [ sec : code ] .",
    "we derive the theoretical limit of survival from engulfment by evolving host stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : orbital evolution ] shows examples of the orbital evolution of planets around stars with initial masses , @xmath6 , of ( a ) @xmath37 and ( b ) @xmath38 ; the metallicity is 0.02 .",
    "we have integrated the orbit of a 1@xmath39 planet ( @xmath39 : jupiter s mass ) with different initial semimajor axes ( solid lines ) from the host - star s zero - age main sequence until the planet s semimajor axis falls below the stellar radius ( @xmath40 ) or until the agb thermal pulse ( agb - tp ) occurs .",
    "the evolution of the stellar radii is represented by the dashed lines .",
    "although we have continued the simulations after the end of heb ( grey areas in the figure ) , our interest in this study is in whether planets survive the rgb and heb phases of their host stars .",
    "this is because the planet - harboring gk clump giants that we target for the comparison of our survival limit with the semimajor axes of their planets are thought to be in the heb or rgb phases , as stated in introduction .",
    "as for orbital evolution of planets around agb stars , @xcite made a thorough investigation .    as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : orbital evolution]a , the 1.8@xmath1 star expands up to @xmath41  au at the rgb - tip .",
    "as the stellar radius becomes large , tidal decay is rapidly enhanced ( eq .  [ [ eq : orbit ] ] ) , so that the star consequently swallows planets whose initial semimajor axes , @xmath42 , are smaller than 1.1  au .",
    "the planet that starts out at 1.1  au is tidally pulled by the host star , but it barely survives the rgb - tip and remains in the heb phases .",
    "outer planets ( e.g. , @xmath43  au ) are found to be pushed outwards because of stellar mass loss ; the effect is , however , small , unlike in the case of 1@xmath1 stars , as also noted previously @xcite . as for the 2@xmath1 star ,",
    "the rgb - tip radius is as small as 0.20  au ( fig .",
    "[ fig : orbital evolution]b ) . as a consequence , even a planet starting out at 0.36  au can avoid engulfment during the rgb / heb phases .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    we define a critical initial semimajor axis ( @xmath4 ) below which planets end up being engulfed by their host stars at some point on the rgb or heb . for the above two examples , @xmath44  au around the 1.8@xmath1 star , while @xmath45  0.36  au around the 2@xmath1 star",
    "it is thus illustrated that the survival limit is rather sensitive to the host star s mass .",
    "furthermore , comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : orbital evolution]b with the upper - right panel of fig .  1 of @xcite ,",
    "one notices that the value of @xmath4 derived here for the 2@xmath1 star is considerably different from that derived by @xcite , who estimated @xmath4 to be 2.1  au , instead of 0.36  au .",
    "the reason for the difference is discussed in section  [ sec : code ] .    for comparison with semimajor axes of the detected planets ,",
    "the above definition of @xmath4 may be inappropriate , because it is the initial value of the semimajor axis of the planet that barely survives the host - star s rgb - tip .",
    "as shown in the above figure , the planet s semimajor axis after the rgb - tip is lower than its initial value .",
    "however , the probability that such planets are detected should be low .",
    "because of unambiguity of definition , we decide to use the critical semimajor axis defined above .",
    "figure  [ fig : amin vs. aorb ] shows the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath6 for @xmath46 and 20  @xmath39 . the stellar rgb - tip radius ( @xmath47 ) is also shown by the dashed line .     ,",
    "width=302 ]    first , one notices that the curves for @xmath4 are similar in shape to that for @xmath47 .",
    "this is because the tidal decay rate of planetary orbit is quite sensitive to the stellar radius ( see eq .  [ [ eq : orbit ] ] ) .",
    "that means planet engulfment , in most cases , occurs right around the rgb - tip of the host star , at which the stellar radius takes a maximum during rgb / heb phases .",
    "to see that more clearly , we derive an approximate expression of @xmath48 as follows . from equation  ( [ eq : orbit ] ) ,",
    "a typical decay timescale ( @xmath49 ) can be expressed by @xmath50 provided the mass - loss effect is negligible .",
    "if @xmath49 is comparable to the typical duration of the rgb phase ( @xmath51 ) , then the planet is engulfed by its host star .",
    "thus , @xmath4 would be expressed as @xmath52 in deriving this equation , based on our numerical results , we have assumed that @xmath53 and @xmath54 in equations  ( [ eq : k ] ) and ( [ eq : t ] ) and used @xmath55 with the stellar rgb - tip luminosity @xmath56 and @xmath57  @xmath20/6 @xmath58 ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : k]]-[[eq : t ] ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : acrit ] ) confirms that @xmath47 is the most important factor and the others have minor impacts on @xmath4 .",
    "note that we have found that @xmath51 is not sensitive to stellar mass ; for example , the periods during which @xmath59 in the rgb phase are 4.3  myr , 9.7  myr , and 5.2  myr for 1.5@xmath1 , 2.0@xmath1 , and 3.0@xmath1 stars with @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that equation  ( [ eq : acrit ] ) agrees well with the numerical values of @xmath4 on the high - mass side in fig .",
    "[ fig : amin vs. aorb ] ; the differences are less than 10  % for @xmath61 . on the low - mass side",
    "( i.e. , @xmath62 ) , the differences are bigger ; for example , equation  ( [ eq : acrit ] ) predicts that @xmath4 is bigger by about 25  % ( 0.4au ) than its numerical value for @xmath63 .",
    "this is because the stellar mass loss is relatively effective in pushing planets outwards in the low - mass cases .",
    "next , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : amin vs. aorb ] , there is a sharp transition in between 1.7  @xmath1 and 2.1  @xmath1 : @xmath4 changes by approximately one order of magnitude in such a narrow mass range .",
    "the transition corresponds to that of @xmath47 that is related to the thermal state of the stellar helium core .",
    "a low - mass star of @xmath64 has a degenerate helium core after the exhaustion of the central hydrogen and undergoes the helium flash , which causes significant expansion in its rgb phase ; in contrast , an intermediate - mass star of @xmath65 soon starts the 3@xmath66 burning at its center instead of the helium flash , so that @xmath47 is relatively small .    finally , the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath6 is qualitatively the same regardless of stellar metallicity ( @xmath67 ) , but @xmath4 decreases with decreasing @xmath67 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : metallicity ] .",
    "this is also related to the dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath67 .",
    "because of low opacity in the atmosphere and of low efficiency of the cno cycle at the hydrogen - burning shell , metal - poor rgb stars expand less compared to metal - rich rgb stars .    , width=302 ]",
    "the critical semimajor axis , @xmath4 , that we have calculated numerically is compared with measured semimajor axes of planets so far detected around gk clump giants in figure  [ fig : observation ] : @xmath4 for @xmath68 1  @xmath39 and 20  @xmath39 and @xmath67 = 0.01 are represented by solid lines .",
    "the measured semimajor axes are represented by symbols with error bars ",
    "filled squares are data from the literature , while filled circles are values that we have re - evaluated using theoretical evolution curves generated with mesa .",
    "published values of the stellar masses were evaluated based on other stellar codes @xcite .    ,",
    "width=302 ]    re - evaluation of stellar masses has been done just for self - consistency ; that never means our values are more reasonable than the published ones .",
    "because stars of interest in this study are located in a region crowded with evolutionary curves in the h - r diagram , it is natural that the estimation of stellar mass includes large uncertainty , which is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "note that the three different codes , namely , mesa , @xcite s , and @xcite s yield similar values of @xmath4 , as found in section  [ sec : code ] .",
    "the evaluated values of stellar masses are listed on table  [ tbl : stars ] . as a result of stellar - mass re - evaluation , planetary masses and semimajor axes",
    "are also changed .",
    "these values are also listed on table 1 . in comparing observational data with theoretical curves ,",
    "we have assumed that stars are located in heb or post - heb phases .",
    "figure  [ fig : observation ] indicates two important things : first , one finds that almost all the symbols are above the curves of @xmath4 .",
    "although the mean values for a few planets are smaller than @xmath4 , those error bars extend out to the curves of @xmath4 .",
    "second , however , one realizes that on the high - mass side ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) , planets exist far above @xmath4 .",
    "there seems to be a gap between the theoretical survival - limit and the observed existence - limit of planets .",
    "thus , our comparison with observation suggests that planet engulfment by host stars may not be the main reason for the lack of spgps , at least , for @xmath69 .",
    "note that we have to keep in mind that the number of planets may be still statistically insufficient .",
    "the presence of the gap is not due to observational biases .",
    "clump giants typically show intrinsic radial - velocity variability of @xmath70 = 1020 m s@xmath71 ( sato et al . 2005 ) .",
    "given that we can only detect planets that impart radial - velocity semiamplitude of @xmath72 m s@xmath71 ( i.e. , 2@xmath70 ) to their host stars , we indicate the detection limits by dashed lines for @xmath68 1 , 2 , and 3  @xmath39 in the figure . while the detectable limit for planets of @xmath73 1 @xmath39 is below @xmath4 , that for planets of @xmath74 2 @xmath39 is significantly above @xmath4 . because the masses of the planets shown in the figure are all more than 2  @xmath39 , the gap that we have found is not due to such observational biases .",
    "for tidal dissipation , this study is based on the widespread idea of turbulent viscosity ( eqs .  [ [ eq : k]]-[[eq : t ] ] ) .",
    "it remains uncertain how to deal with fast tide when the planetary orbital period , @xmath22 , is shorter than the eddy turnover timescale , @xmath17 .",
    "for such a situation to be taken into account , the factor @xmath20 is added in equation  ( [ eq : orbit ] ) to weaken the stellar tide .",
    "we have adopted the kolmogorov scaling , namely , @xmath75 , which supposes that only small eddies whose intrinsic turnover times are shorter than the orbital period contribute to the tidal dissipation @xcite . however , the kolmogorov picture is known to be too simplified for the turbulent viscosity .",
    "the dependence of the viscosity on @xmath76 is a matter of debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "for example , recent hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite demonstrate that the dependence is close to linear ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) , which happens to be consistent with that proposed by @xcite who assumed that the largest eddy dominates tidal dissipation .",

    "it also plots the measured semimajor axes of the planets of interest . in calculating @xmath4",

    "width=302 ]    as @xmath81 increases , the tidal dissipation becomes less efficient , when @xmath82 .",

    ", @xmath4 is about twice as large as that for @xmath87 on the high - mass side . even in this case",
    ", decreasing @xmath81 does not fill the gap .",
    "finally we comment on the @xmath88-prescription for stellar tide .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : orbit ] ) can be written in the form by the use of the quality factor , @xmath89 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath90 in this study , @xmath89 varies with time , while @xmath89 is often assumed to be constant ( @xmath91-@xmath92 for ms stars in the literature ) .",
    "@xcite studied tidal engulfment mainly by agb stars in both cases of variable @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) and constant @xmath93 (= @xmath95 ) .",
    "they found that the tidal decay rate in the former case is about 4 orders of magnitude higher than that in the latter case .",
    "in many cases of this study , @xmath96 , instead of @xmath97 .",
    "thus , it would be worth checking the outcome for constant @xmath89 in our high - mass cases .",
    "the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : tidal model ] shows @xmath4 calculated by equation  ( [ eq : cpl ] ) with @xmath98 . as seen in the figure , the tidal decay with @xmath99 yields similar values of @xmath4 that we derive with variable @xmath89 on the high - mass side .",
    "this means stellar tide with high @xmath89 does not fill the gap neither .",
    "there are several different stellar - evolution models in the literature , as mentioned in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "we discuss the differences in terms of the survival limit , and clarify the cause of the relatively big difference in @xmath4 between this study and @xcite .    in fig .",

    "those two codes do not include overshooting .",
    "the lines with crosses and squares are the results calculated with grid data from @xcite and @xcite , respectively , which include overshooting ; those code have been used to estimate the mass of planet - host clump giants .    ,",
    "width=302 ]    when deriving @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : acrit - codes ] , except for those from @xcite , we have assumed that @xmath100 and @xmath101 in calculating quantities relevant to stellar tide , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : k ] ] and [ [ eq : t ] ] ) , because no detailed information about the stellar internal structure is available .",
    "such simplification certainly results in inaccurate evaluation of tidal dissipation ( i.e. , @xmath102 ) , but the tidal dissipation factor was found to play a minor role in @xmath4 in section  [ sec : survival limit ] ; the most important factor is the stellar radius .",
    "this means that such simplification as to stellar structure does not affect our conclusions in this section .",
    "we have figured out that inclusion of overshooting probably causes the difference in @xmath4 between our calculations ( solid line without symbol ) and @xcite s ( triangles ) .",
    "qualitatively , overshooting plays a role in mixing hydrogen and helium , so that stellar models with overshooting contain bigger helium cores compared to those without overshooting .",
    "this results in higher central temperature , which prevents the helium core from being degenerated .",
    "this means that overshooting is effective in moving the sharp transition from the high-@xmath4 to the low-@xmath4 domains leftwards in fig .",
    "[ fig : acrit - codes ] .",
    "that is why we have obtained a value of @xmath4 quite different from that by @xcite for @xmath103 .    in any case , the drastic decrease in @xmath48 due to avoidance of helium flash does occur , independent of simulation code , although the threshold mass somewhat depends on code .",
    "difference in code never changes our conclusion concerning the survival limit .",
    "since we are interested in semimajor axes of planets , we have integrated the equation for change in semimajor axis ( eq .  [ [ eq : orbit ] ] ) , ignoring eccentricity , following previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "note that the evolution of @xmath109 itself coupled with that of host stars rotation is an interesting problem , which is our future work .",
    "a possibility other than planet engulfment is that some stellar - mass - dependent processes hinder the formation of spgps around 1.5 - 3@xmath1 stars . for example , ultraviolet measurements of young stars indicate that the stellar accretion rate ( @xmath110 ) increases rather rapidly with the stellar mass , namely , @xmath111 @xcite .",

    "more distant snowlines due to high luminosity of such stars also tend to reduce the frequency ( ida & lin 2005 ) .",
    "on the other hand , more massive disks and shorter kepler periods at given semimajor axes form giant planets faster , which results in higher production rate of spgps and suggests that detection frequency of giant planets may be higher around high - mass stars @xcite .",
    "further detailed observational data on spgps will constrain stellar mass dependence of planet formation .",
    "in this study we have derived the survival limit beyond which planets are engulfed by their host stars in the rgb and heb phases , by numerically simulating both the tidal evolution of planetary orbits and the evolution of the host stars .",
    "then , we have made a detailed comparison of the survival limit with observed semimajor axes of planets detected so far around gk clump giants .",
    "the comparison demonstrates that ( 1 ) almost all the planets are orbiting exterior to our theoretical survival limit and ( 2 ) the planets around stars with relatively large masses of @xmath3 are far outside the survival limit .",
    "those facts suggest that planet engulfment by host stars may actually happened , but it may never be the main reason for the observed lack of short - period planets around clump giants . because the number of planets is statistically insufficient in that high - mass range , we have to say that our findings are not definite .",
    "the problem we addressed have a great influence on our understanding of planet formation .",
    "therefore , further surveys for planets around clump giants are highly encouraged .",
    "we would like to express our gratitude to the following persons : bill paxton and aaron dotter kindly helped us install and use the stellar - evolution code mesa and modified it upon our request .",
    "masayuki y. fujimoto and takuma suda gave useful comments about stellar evolution .",
    "we had fruitful discussion on this study with yasunori hori and taishi nakamoto .",

    "<S> we integrate the orbital evolution of planets in the rgb and helium burning ( heb ) phases of host stars , including the effects of stellar tide and stellar mass loss . </S>",
    "<S> then we derive the critical semimajor axis ( or the survival limit ) inside which planets are eventually engulfed by their host stars after tidal decay of their orbits . </S>",
    "<S> especially , we investigate the impact of stellar mass and other stellar parameters on the survival limit in more detail than previous studies . in addition , we make detailed comparison with measured semimajor axes of planets detected so far , which no previous study did . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the critical semimajor axis is quite sensitive to stellar mass in the range between 1.7 and 2.1 @xmath1 , which suggests a need for careful comparison between theoretical and observational limits of existence of planets . </S>",
    "<S> our comparison demonstrates that all those planets are beyond the survival limit , which is consistent with the planet - engulfment hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> however , on the high - mass side ( @xmath2 ) , the detected planets are orbiting significantly far from the survival limit , which suggests that engulfment by host stars may not be the main reason for the observed lack of short - period giant planets . to confirm our conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the detection of more planets around clump giants , especially with masses @xmath3 , is required . </S>"
