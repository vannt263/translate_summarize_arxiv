    "such a characterization is needed , for example , when one attempts to construct a quantum channel comprising multiple logic gates , each carrying out a specific quantum process .",
    "one such quantum channel for entanglement distillation , for instance , would consist of cnot gates .",
    "a physical quantum process is described by a completely - positive map @xmath0 .",
    "that is , given a particular input quantum state @xmath1 residing in the @xmath2-dimensional hilbert space @xmath3 , the resulting output state @xmath4 in the @xmath5-dimensional hilbert space @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 with the kraus operators @xmath8 satisfying the relation @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath8s are not unique and any other set of kraus operators @xmath10 where the @xmath11s are the elements of a unitary matrix , also parameterizes the completely - positive map @xmath0 @xcite .    the idea behind qpt is to estimate such completely - positive maps with measurements . much like quantum state tomography , the estimation of an unknown quantum process can be perceived as the estimation of a positive _ choi - jamikowski operator _",
    "@xmath12 that is represented by a @xmath13 matrix @xcite .",
    "such an operator contains all accessible information about the quantum process .",
    "the standard qpt procedure involves the measurement of multiple copies of @xmath14 different output states , with each output state corresponding to one of the @xmath14 linearly independent input states @xmath15 , thereby using a probability operator measurement ( pom ) of , say , @xmath16 outcomes .",
    "the unknown operator @xmath12 is estimated by linear - inversion of the @xmath17 measurement frequencies , which consists of @xmath18 linearly independent constraints . like the linear - inversion procedure for quantum state estimation , the resulting estimator obtained may not be positive .",
    "if that is the case , the estimator can not be used for statistical predictions .",
    "this failure occurs whenever the observed relative frequencies of the measurement outcomes do not have consistent interpretation as probabilities . what is , therefore , called for ,",
    "is an estimation procedure that ensures a physically meaningful estimator whatever the measurement data may be .",
    "one statistically meaningful technique to obtain a positive estimator for @xmath12 is the maximum - likelihood estimation procedure ( ml ) @xcite .",
    "this can be applied to yield a unique estimator @xmath19 as long as the measurement data obtained form a set of @xmath18 linearly independent constraints .",
    "we say that this set of measurement data is informationally complete .",
    "however , the number of linearly independent parameters increases rapidly with the dimensions and a complete characterization of @xmath12 becomes unfeasible for complex processes .",
    "this is especially true when the quantum process acts on an infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xcite .",

    "@xcite was introduced to reduce the amount of measurement resources that are used for quantum process tomography .",
    "however , this method requires entangled input states and post - processing strategies that can be expensive when dealing with more complex quantum processes .",
    "a more straightforward and conceptually different approach is to resort to informationally incomplete qpt . with this approach , less measurement resources",
    "are used to obtain an estimator for the unknown quantum process to a fair amount of accuracy . as a consequence",
    ", there exists a convex set of infinitely many ml estimators which are consistent with the measurement data . to choose the estimator which is least - biased from the convex set",
    ", we invoke the maximum - entropy principle @xcite and choose the estimator with the largest entropy .",
    "such an incomplete qpt can also give useful information about the quantum channel .",
    "in a typical tomography experiment , with data from measuring a finite number of copies , the resulting quantum process estimator can never be exactly equal to @xmath12 since experimental fluctuations are inevitable .",
    "one can only obtain an estimator that is close to @xmath12 within a certain tomographic precision .",
    "thus , mlme qpt is typically useful in providing a unique estimator for an unknown quantum process within a suitable tomographic precision using fewer incomplete measurement resources . as will be shown ,",
    "this reduction in measurement resources is more pronounced for unitary quantum channels .",
    "since @xmath12 is unknown , one common practice is to gauge such a tomographic precision with another operator @xmath20 that is close to @xmath12 , based on some prior information one has about the constructed quantum channel .",
    "the availability of such a @xmath20 for a given @xmath12 will become useful and important in subsequent discussions .",
    "the estimators obtained using the aforementioned method are least - biased with respect to the set of incomplete measurement data in the sense of the _ entropy of the quantum process_. in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is an analytical study of the conventional maximum - entropy method , the entropy functional for the choi - jamikowski operator @xmath21 describing a quantum channel was introduced as @xmath22 and this was shown to exhibit nice properties . in particular , this concave channel entropy functional has a unique maximum in @xmath21 and is zero only when the quantum channel is unitary since @xmath23 is then a rank-1 projector .",

    "the estimation of the completely - positive map @xmath0 that describes an unknown quantum process , in the manner presented in eq .",
    "( [ cptp ] ) , is isomorphic to the estimation of an unknown quantum state .",

    "let us define a maximally - entangled pure state @xmath25 in terms of the computational basis kets @xmath26 . here , the dimensions of the hilbert spaces @xmath3 and @xmath27 are both equal to the dimension @xmath2 of the input hilbert space .",
    "using this basis , there exists a one - to - one correspondence between the map @xmath0 and a unique positive operator @xmath21 defined as follows : @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the identity map . from eq .",

    "the output state can be expressed in terms of @xmath21 by means of @xmath32 where the transposition is defined with respect to the computational basis .",
    "hence , reconstructing the quantum process amounts to estimating the positive operator @xmath21 .",
    "to do so , one requires a total of @xmath18 real parameters to specify the corresponding matrix . in the subsequent analyses",
    ", we shall consider trace - preserving maps , that is @xmath33 for any @xmath1 , in which case the number of independent parameters is reduced to @xmath34 , with the constraints compactly written as @xmath35    to estimate @xmath21 , typically a set of @xmath14 input states @xmath15 , with @xmath36 copies each , are sent through the quantum channel , one state at a time .",

    "the probability of getting outcome @xmath40 for the input state @xmath15 is given by @xmath41 . here , @xmath42 .",
    "if the @xmath17 parameters comprise @xmath18 linearly independent ones , the measurement data will be informationally complete .",

    ", we shall discuss the situation in which one performs quantum process estimation with a set of informationally incomplete measurement data .",
    "all processes considered henceforth will be trace - preserving , but a generalization to those which are not trace - preserving is straightforward .",
    "we consider the optimization of the information functional @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a parameter which scales the entropy relative to the normalized log - likelihood and should be chosen with a very small value . when the measurement data are informationally complete , one sets @xmath47 to zero and optimizing @xmath48 amounts to the ml problem @xcite",
    ". in the same spirit as in @xcite , both our knowledge from the measurement data ( contained in @xmath49 which measures the information gain ) and our ignorance ( reflected in @xmath50 which measures the lack of information ) about the operator @xmath21 are taken into account in such a way that our ignorance takes an infinitesimal weight .",
    "this introduces a small and smooth convex hill over the set of positive ml estimators which selects the one with the largest entropy . as in @xcite ,",
    "the value of @xmath47 may be chosen such that both @xmath49 and @xmath50 remain almost constant with respect to @xmath47 .    to maximize @xmath51 with respect to @xmath21 , we define the variation @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a small arbitrary operator such that eq .",

    "this is expected in analogy with quantum state tomography where it is more difficult to reliably estimate highly - mixed states than nearly - pure ones .",
    "an interesting question to ask with regard to incomplete qpt is whether one can perform it in an optimal way given the available resources by means of adaptive strategies .",
    "here optimality refers to the minimization of the amount of resources ( input states or measurements ) used to perform incomplete qpt such that the distance between @xmath24 and @xmath12 reaches a certain desired value .",
    "very frequently , despite the fact that @xmath12 is always unknown , one has a rough idea of an operator @xmath20 which may be close to @xmath12 based on some prior information about the unknown @xmath12 .",

    "we shall establish adaptive strategies which make use of such an operator in order to select , with the help of the mlme algorithm , resources for incomplete qpt in an optimal way .",
    "we refer to such tomography schemes as the _ adaptive mlme quantum process tomography _ ( amlme qpt ) schemes .",
    "we will focus on adaptive strategies to choose the input states optimally .",

    "[ subsec : all_input ] ) .",
    "the optimization of the pom will be studied on a later occasion .      in the previous section",
    ", we considered the projectors of the sic poms , which are known to have optimal tomographic efficiencies , as input states in the numerical simulations .",
    "since these poms are symmetric in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ sicpom ] ) , any ordering of the input states in a given set gives the same plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : channels ] . in practice , however , such entangled states are difficult to produce and one typically has access to a set of separable states @xcite for measurements instead . in this case",
    ", there no longer exists such a symmetry and the tomographic performance depends on the order of the input states chosen , possibly strongly so .",
    "we propose to optimize the tomographic performance by choosing the input states adaptively based on the measurement data collected from the previously chosen input states , thereby using the prior @xmath20 .    to describe the adaptive strategy ,",
    "let us consider a set of @xmath96 input states in which @xmath97 of them are linearly independent .",
    "suppose that @xmath36 , which is a fixed integer for all input states , copies of a randomly chosen input state @xmath98 are sent through the quantum channel and the first set of measurement data @xmath99 , @xmath100 , is collected . with these data @xmath101 ,",
    "one obtains the first mlme estimator @xmath102 . to select the next input state out of the remaining @xmath103 states ,",
    "we take @xmath20 as a gauge for @xmath12 to generate @xmath103 sets of probabilities respectively from the @xmath103 states .",
    "each set of probabilities is then treated as the set of frequencies @xmath104 , for the corresponding input state @xmath105 .",
    "hence , one has @xmath103 sets of measurement data , each set being the combined data @xmath106 with the normalized frequencies @xmath107 and @xmath108 such that @xmath109 for each @xmath105 , and the corresponding @xmath103 _ projected _ mlme estimators @xmath110 .",
    "the value of @xmath105 is selected such that a chosen figure of merit which quantifies the distance between @xmath110 and @xmath102 is the largest , so that there is a high chance for the next mlme estimator to be closer to @xmath12 . as an example",
    ", the figure of merit is taken to be the trace - class distance @xmath111 . with this input state ,",
    "the second estimator @xmath112 is then obtained with mlme qpt .",
    "one repeats this procedure for subsequent input states until the distance @xmath113 is below some preset threshold .",
    "an alternative to this would be to _ minimize _ the trace - class distance @xmath114 .",
    "it is important to understand that in this strategy , the prior information @xmath20 is _ not _ used to reconstruct the unknown quantum process in any way .",
    "it serves only as a means to optimally select the input states from the given set so as to maximize the tomographic convergence .",
    "this adaptive strategy also relies partially on the measurement data obtained in the experiment .",
    "we have thus introduced an operational method of using the prior information to minimize the amount of resources needed to perform reliable mlme qpt without introducing any artifacts coming from the prior information into the reconstruction procedure .",
    "to summarize , the adaptive mlme strategy is as follows :    1 .   randomly choose @xmath98 from the set of @xmath14 input states and set @xmath115 .",

    "2 .   set @xmath128 and repeat steps 1(a)1(e ) .",
    "+      more generally , the adaptive strategy may be extended to the case in which one has access to the entire hilbert space of states . in other words ,",

    "coincidentally , this maximum projected log - likelihood ( mpl ) procedure is equivalent to minimizing the cross entropy functional @xmath138 @xcite over all positive operators subjected to the respective constraints for @xmath136 and @xmath21 .",

    "a point of view to justify this conjecture is to interpret the maximum of the normalized log - likelihood functional @xmath49 as the maximum information gain from the measurement data .",
    "when the number of copies @xmath36 is infinite , the data are noiseless and the resulting maximum information gain is @xmath164 , which is the negative of the shannon entropy of the measurement data . for finite @xmath36 , the maximum information gain over the space of density operators will typically be lower than the true maximum due to the positivity constraint , especially when @xmath12 is highly rank - deficient . in this language , the mpl - mlme strategy attempts to maximize this maximum information gain as much as possible via the optimization of future input states over the entire hilbert space of density operators , using the normalized projected log - likelihood functional as an estimate for the actual normalized log - likelihood functional describing future measurements .",
    "this is a possible explanation for the optimal decrease in the likelihood plateau size since one has maximal knowledge about the unknown @xmath12 gained with the optimized input states and so the ambiguity in the estimators is minimized .    ) and the normalized log - likelihood maximum on the number of input states .",

    "figure  [ fig : plateau_height ] compares the respective performances of the the three proposed schemes by analyzing the size of the likelihood plateau and the maximum of the normalized log - likelihood functional . from fig .",
    "[ fig : plateau_height ] , it is crucial to understand that @xmath165 does not , strictly speaking , decrease monotonically with increasing height of the normalized log - likelihood functional .",
    "a counterexample is shown in the figure , that is a significant decrease in @xmath165 for the adaptive mlme scheme as compared to the non - adaptive one with the corresponding slight decrease in its normalized log - likelihood maxima .",
    "we emphasize that what the adaptive mpl - mlme strategy exploits is the possible _ trend _ of this behavior .",
    "to end this part of the section , we comment that the aforementioned idea can be applied to adaptively choose the next set of pom outcomes @xmath173 based on the collected measurement data .",
    "however , to perform the optimization successfully requires the solutions to more technical problems which include ensuring that the pom outcomes are linearly independent after the optimization .",
    "this project is left for future studies .",
    "let us begin this final part of the section by reviewing the non - convex feature of the mpl - mlme strategy discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : all_input ] .",
    "the presence of multiple local - maxima estimators which are linearly independent is an important element of the mpl - mlme strategy as it provides linearly independent input states which are optimal for measurement based on the data obtained from the experiments . in general , because of the non - linearity of eq .",
    "( [ mplextremal ] ) , it is difficult to determine the number of such linearly independent extremal solutions for a given set of measurement data by analytical means .",
    "one can only search for as many linearly independent local - maxima estimators @xmath148 as possible via numerical optimizations from different starting points within a reasonable time period .    .",
    "here , @xmath94 and an average over 50 experiments is taken to compute the trace - class distances .",
    "for both the non - adaptive as well as the adaptive mlme schemes , the default set of 16 linearly independent input states are chosen to be tensor products of projectors of the kets @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "for all schemes , a set of 16 randomly generated positive operators , which are all linearly independent of one another , are used to form the pom . for this pom ,",
    "the average repetition frequency of the adaptive mpl - mlme scheme is very high after four input states are used .",
    "the first input state for all schemes is chosen to be the same separable state @xmath174 . for the third scheme ,",
    "the second to the fourth input states ( shaded region ) are optimized using the adaptive mpl - mlme strategy and the subsequent input states are chosen via the adaptive mlme strategy using the default set of input states which excludes @xmath175 .",
    "the plot shows that the overall performance of the combined strategy is better than the adaptive mlme strategy alone.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    another technical subtlety is that these local - maxima estimators tend to repeat themselves during the optimization .",
    "hence , a local - maxima estimator which was chosen as one of the input states earlier may reappear in later optimizations .",
    "the repetition frequency strongly depends on the pom chosen to measure the output states .",
    "the examples given thus far make use of the product tetrahedron measurements as the pom and the resulting mpl optimizations give linearly independent estimators with few repetitions",
    ". this may not be the case for other types of pom . in view of this , another way of doing amlme qpt is to use both adaptive strategies in secs .",
    "[ subsec : fixed_input ] and [ subsec : all_input ] interchangeably , the _ hybrid _ mlme strategy .",
    "for example , one can start with the adaptive mpl - mlme strategy for tomography and when the repetition rate increases as more input states have been used , one may switch to the first adaptive mlme strategy .",
    "figure  [ fig : combined ] suggests that such a hybrid mlme strategy can further improve the tomographic performance as compared with the adaptive mlme strategy alone .",
    "we have established adaptive numerical strategies to perform incomplete quantum process tomography .",
    "one may choose whichever strategy that is convenient to her to carry out tomography depending on the available types of measurement resources at hand .",
    "each of these strategies combines the simplicity of incomplete quantum process tomography using quantum state estimation with good tomographic performances using optimization techniques .",
    "it can never be overemphasized that , although some prior information is necessary for each adaptive strategy , such information is _ never _ used in the estimation of the unknown quantum process .",
    "rather , the prior information is utilized to adaptively select future measurement resources , the input states in our context , based on the current measurement data , to optimize the tomographic performance .",
    "the discussions presented in this article , therefore , provide a means of obtaining estimators for the unknown quantum process using incomplete resources which are typically within reasonably good experimental precisions .",
    "these estimators are statistically meaningful in that they are least - biased with respect to a set of informationally incomplete measurement data and are hence suitable for partial characterization of quantum processes .",
    "this is in contrast with the standard quantum process tomography which generally requires a huge amount of informationally complete measurement resources .",
