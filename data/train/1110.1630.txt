    "it is well known that the star formation activity in a galaxy correlates strongly with its stellar mass or stellar surface density ( dopita & ryder 1994 ; hunter et al .",

    "characterizing the relations between stellar mass , star formation rate ( sfr ) , and gas densities over cosmic time will provide important constraints on galaxy evolution by connecting the past history , present activity , and future growth of a galaxy ( schiminovich et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "a key factor in galaxy evolution is the rate at which molecular gas is converted to stars .",
    "observational studies find that the relationship between sfr and gas content in galaxies can be written in the form , @xmath6 , where  and  are the sfr and gas surface densities respectively , @xmath7 is the normalization constant representing the efficiency of the process , and @xmath8 is the power - law index ( schmidt 1959 ; kennicutt 1989 , 1998 )",
    ". the gas can be atomic ( ) or molecular ( ) or a combination of both ( + ) .",
    "this relationship is generally known as the kennicutt - schmidt law or the star formation law , and variations on it are used as a empirical recipe in galaxy modeling ( schaye & della vecchia 2008 ; lagos et al.2010 ) .    in recent years",
    "has become increasingly clear the importance of understanding the link between star formation activity and gravitationally bound molecular clouds ( wong & blitz 2002 ; tutukov 2006 ; kennicutt et al .  2007 ;",

    "recent observational studies indicate a strong relationship between the -to-  transition and the gravitational potential of the stellar disk and thus evince the connection between stellar pressure and the phase transition in the interstellar medium ( wong & blitz 2002 ; blitz & rosolowsky 2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "numerical simulations that include cold gas and heating from young stellar population in evolution of interstellar medium ( ism ) are in general agreement with the observations ( robertson & kravtsov 2008 ) .    most properties of galaxies , not least their star formation activity , are strongly correlated with mass ( see gavazzi 2009 for a review ) . because new stars are born inside giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , which themselves evolve within the existing galactic stellar potential ( rafikov 2001 ; li et al .",

    ", we investigate the -  relation at sub - kpc and kpc scales in 14 nearby star - forming disk galaxies . while gas - sfr surface density relation provides an understanding of on - going activities in the disk , the molecular gas depletion time ( ) provides a measure of its future evolution .",

    "the 6  angular resolution covers a range of physical scales in our sample , @xmath24  pc , corresponding to physical distances @xmath25  mpc .",
    "the galaxies ngc  772 , ngc  3147 , ngc  4273 , and ngc  5371 , shown in bold face in table [ basic_table ] , have distances such that 6corresponds to @xmath26  kpc in spatial scale  those galaxies are left at their native resolution in the 1  kpc analysis , while the remaining 10 galaxies are gaussian convolved to the angular resolution corresponding to 1  kpc .",

    "we construct molecular gas surface density ( ) maps and sfr surface density ( ) maps in a similar manner as described in paper i. in the latter case following the prescription by calzetti et al.(2007 ) who show that mir 24  emission can be used as a sfr tracer for galaxies of normal metallicity and where the energy output is dominated by recent star formation . the mir 24  sfr tracer",

    "the surface densities are multiplied by a factor of 1.36 to account for the mass contribution of helium .",
    "construction of stellar surface density maps ( ) involves two steps .",
    "first , we convert @xmath22-band luminosity ( ) to stellar mass ( ) .",
    "we use the @xmath33 optical colors for our galaxies and the relations by bell & de jong ( 2003 ) to compute the mass - to - light ratios in each galaxy . in our sample",
    ", we find a mass - to - light ratio @xmath34  /.",
    "next , each pixel of the  map of a given galaxy is multiplied by the appropriate  to derive the stellar mass map , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "each pixel value of the  map is then divided by the area of the pixel to obtain the  map .",
    "the galaxy integrated stellar masses are determined by integrating their @xmath36-band 2-d surface brightness profile after masking of foreground or background objects .",
    "the nir and mir images were background subtracted prior to analysis .",
    "all surface densities have been inclination - corrected by applying a @xmath37 factor .",
    "there are uncertainties associated with the measurements of stellar masses .",
    "although nir emission is a good tracer of old ( gyr ) stellar populations and it experiences little internal extinction , there is uncertainty associated with the determination of mass - to - light ratios .",
    "for one , extinction affects the optical colors used in the calibration and consequently the employed mass - to - light ratio .",
    "more fundamentally , the mass - to - light ratio depends on the star formation history of the disk .",
    "hence it varies considerably among galaxies of the same hubble type and even within galaxies .",
    "for example , young m - supergiants near the plane of the disk ( aoki et al.1991 ) as well as massive ob - associations ( regan & vogel 1994 ) can contribute about @xmath38 of the total nir disk emission ( rix & rieke 1993 ; regan & vogel 1994 ) , potentially lowering the actual mass - to - light ratio and causing us to overestimate masses by factors of @xmath39 .",
    "the sensitivity and flux recovery of the interferometric map limits the physical extent of the disk that can be studied . to minimize the effects of deconvolution and flux recovery problems",
    "we analyze the central 1  ( in diameter ) of the disks . table [",
    "basic_table ] shows the physical extent of disk ( @xmath40 ) corresponding to the inner arcminute for the sting galaxies .",
    "following the methodology developed in paper i we set a surface density threshold of @xmath41 . studying the emission from the bright regions of the molecular gas and sfr tracer maps ensures that : 1 ) the signal - to - noise is good , 2 ) interferometric deconvolution issues are minimized , 3 ) the potential contribution by the diffuse emission ( de ) is less problematic , and 4 ) we focus on regions dominated by molecular gas .",
    "the de is a component of the total disk emission that is unrelated to star formation activity and extended over the disk , in comparison to the localized emission associated with star formation .",
    "for example , a potential contributor to the de at 24  is infrared cirrus emission .",
    "the  distribution of a galaxy can also contain de not necessarily associated with the star - forming molecular clouds ( magnani et al .",
    "1985 ; blitz & stark 1986 ; polk et al .",
    "below our chosen surface density limit the de in both sfr and molecular gas tracers has the potential to affect the molecular gas - sfr surface density relation ( see paper i for a detailed discussion on this issue )",
    ".    isolating the contribution of emission related to star formation activity from widespread de is a complex issue .",
    "recent work has shown that the de has a potentially important impact in the determination of the star formation law , depending on its magnitude relative to emission coming from the star formation activity ( paper i ; liu et al.2011 ) . in paper",
    "i we used an unsharp masking technique to remove a diffuse extended component , and showed that the most robust measurements of the star formation law are those performed on the bright regions of the studied galaxy ( ngc  4254 ) . in those regions",
    "the contribution from de is least significant , and the recovered star formation law was approximately linear .",
    "here we adopt the methodology of paper i , and minimize the impact of de by focusing on the bright regions of our sample of disks .",
    "finally , observational studies suggest that -to-  phase transition occurs around @xmath42  ( wong & blitz 2002 ; bigiel et al .  2008 ; leroy et al .  2008 ) and the nature of total gas - sfr surface density relation changes dramatically around this range ( kennicutt et al.2007 ; bigiel et al .",
    "2008 ; l08 ; schruba et al .",
    "2011 ) . by focusing on high molecular gas surface density regions",
    "we avoid this issue .",
    "we carry out a pixel - by - pixel analysis ( where the pixels are sampled at nyquist - rate ) to probe the highest possible spatial resolution .",
    "we use the ordinary least square ( ols ) bisector method ( see isobe et al .",
    "1990 ) to fit the molecular gas - sfr surface density relation and account for the measurement errors in each variable .",
    "as discussed in paper i , it is important to consider the impact of the sampling methodologies , fitting procedures , and measurement errors when determining the -  relation .",
    "some authors normalize  at a characteristic surface density prior to regression analysis to minimize the covariance between the exponent and the normalization constant of the power - law ( see bigiel et al .",
    "2008 and blanc et al.2009 in this regard ) .",
    "we do not apply such normalization , and we have verified that our results are robust to this choice .        in this study",
    "we use the 24  emission as the sfr tracer because it has several advantages over other single- or multi - wavelength tracers employed in the literature ( kennicutt et al .  2007 ; l08 ; blanc et al .",
    "2009 ; verley et al .",
    "most importantly , 24 @xmath43 m images of uniform quality are available for every galaxy in our sample , and no internal extinction correction is needed for this tracer .",
    "this is a major drawback for other sfr tracers at shorter wavelengths .",
    "second , among various tracers studied in paper i we find that the sfr obtained from 24   displays the tightest correlation with the molecular gas .",
    "the scatter varies in the range @xmath44  dex depending on the subtraction of diffuse emission .",
    "third , there is a striking spatial correspondence between the 24  and  maps ( see also relao & kennicutt 2009 ) , suggesting that 24  is a faithful tracer of young ( few million years ) , embedded star formation .    in the following discussion ,",
    "we use  to denote the power - law index of the molecular gas star formation law , where the  gas includes the contribution from helium .",
    "at 6  resolution our analysis includes all 14 galaxies .",
    "ngc  628 drops out of the sample at 1 kpc resolution , however , as its peak surface density falls below the selected  threshold after smoothing .",
    "we have @xmath32000 ( @xmath31000 ) nyquist - sampled pixel measurements arising from 14(13 ) galaxies at 6  ( 1 kpc ) resolution .",
    "the molecular gas and star surface densities span a wide range , @xmath45  and @xmath46  . our results are presented in figures [ ksplot]-[par_sm_plot ] .",
    "the first three figures highlight spatially resolved cases whereas fig .",
    "[ par_sm_plot ] shows global quantities such as average depletion time ( , mean value of  within the central arcminute , calculated in the logarithm ) , and integrated stellar mass as given in table  [ basic_table ] .",
    "figure [ ksplot ] shows the molecular gas - sfr surface density relation at 6  ( top panels ) and 1  kpc resolution ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the diagonal dashed lines represent constant molecular gas depletion time defined as , @xmath47 , assuming zero recycling of the materials by massive stars into the ism .",
    "the left panels show the scatter plots where each nyquist - sampled pixel has equal weight in the distribution .",

    "we discuss this further in  [ moldeptime ] .",
    "a simple correlation test shows that the points in this diagram are strongly correlated : at either resolution we find spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xmath48 .",
    "the ols bisector method yields a power - law index  @xmath31.1@xmath90.1 at either resolution , where the error is derived from bootstrapping .",

    "provide a view of the sample that is not biased by galaxy size . in these panels",
    "any given measurement is weighted by the inverse of the total number of measurements of the galaxy to which the point belongs .",
    "since larger galaxies contribute more points to the ensemble , the weighting scheme removes this bias by giving equal weight to each galaxy ( bigiel et al.2011 ) .",
    "the contours enclose 99% , 75% , 50% and 25% of the distribution .",
    "we note here that in extragalactic studies the inverse of  is sometimes known as the star formation efficiency ( young & scoville 1991 ; mckee & ostriker 2007 ) .",

    "a horizontal dotted line represents the hubble time ,  @xmath313.7 gyr ( spergel et al .  2007 ) .",
    "it is clear from these diagrams that the  depletion time has at most very weak dependence on .",
    "a small correlation coefficient ( @xmath51 ) suggests that  is mostly uniform across the disk the measurements from ngc  772 and ngc  3147 are responsible for the plume of points showing a slow rise in the depletion time with for @xmath52  .",
    "indeed the -  relations in these two galaxies show flatter than average power - law indices ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the reason for this is unclear , but one possibility is that the contribution of de to their 24  luminosity is worse than for the rest of the sample . indeed  is increasingly closer to 1 if we increase the  threshold over 20  .",
    "these galaxies are two of the most distant , thus most massive and intrinsically luminous , objects in our sample . excluding ngc  772 and ngc  3147 we find @xmath2  gyr and @xmath54  gyr at 6  and 1 kpc resolution , respectively ( where the numbers correspond to the median and @xmath32 dispersion in the logarithm of the measurements ) .",
    "the depletion time increases slightly to @xmath55  gyr and @xmath56  gyr at the respective resolutions when these two galaxies are included . in any case with the adopted definition",
    "appears significantly shorter than the hubble time .",
    "our measurements agree very well with the results by bigiel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who studied the molecular gas depletion time in 30 nearby ( @xmath57 mpc ) spirals from the heracles survey ( leroy et al .",
    "2009 ) . given the minimal overlap between the samples , the difference in the criteria used to select the galaxies in both surveys , and the fact that heracles is a single - dish  survey , this agreement shows that  determined in the molecular gas is very similar in disks across a wide range of galaxy properties .",
    "we show  versus the stellar surface density  in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ dtplot ] .",
    "the hatched section on the left shows the region where  decreases monotonically with increasing , and  dominates the gas surface density ( l08 ) .",
    "we do not find any correlation between  and showing that the molecular gas consumption time is independent of stellar surface density in the region of the disk where  is the dominant component of the ism ( see also l08 for a similar result ) .",

    "we begin with the assumption that the stellar mass surface density is a fundamental parameter that influence both local and global evolution and organization of molecular gas in the disk and star formation .",
    "indeed observational evidence shows that almost all physical variables strongly correlate with both global   ( gavazzi 2009 ) and   ( dopita & ryder 1994 ) suggesting that both stellar mass and its surface density have significant roles in galaxy evolution .",

    "this method provides three simple steps to generate random numbers from any arbitrary distribution function : 1 ) construction of the normalized cumulative distribution function of any given variable , 2 ) selection of a random number from a uniform distribution and inspection of the cumulative function to find the match between the two , and 3 ) selection of the variable within the domain that corresponds to the match in step 2 .",
    "we use this method with two additional conditions while sampling  from the observed distribution .",
    "these conditions are : 1 ) the lower and upper limits of the samples surface density must be within the range of observation , and 2 ) the number of observed measurements and simulated points must be the same . with a randomly sampled , we generate sfr and molecular gas mass surface densities using , @xmath121 , where @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 are the corresponding variables in equations [ app : eqn1 ] and [ app : eqn2 ] .",

    "simple correlation analysis strongly suggests that the simulation reproduce the observation reasonably well .",
