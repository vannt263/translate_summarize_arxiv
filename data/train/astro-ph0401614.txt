    "the discovery of the double - pulsar binary system psr  j0737@xmath03039  @xcite represents a landmark in neutron - star astrophysics .",
    "this relativistic system consists of two neutron stars , both radio pulsars , in a 2.4-hr orbit having eccentricity 0.08 , viewed nearly edge - on .",
    "the binary promises unparalleled tests of general relativity . during each orbit , the faster - rotating of the two pulsars , psr  j0737@xmath03039a ( hereafter a ) , which has period @xmath7  ms , is eclipsed briefly at conjunction , while the slower - rotating of the two , psr  j0737@xmath03039b ( @xmath8  s ; hereafter b ) , has unusual and longer - lived flux enhancements near the same epoch @xcite .",
    "this bizarre and unprecedented behavior offers a new opportunity to understand pulsar magnetospheric and wind structures .",
    "this paper is part of a short series describing the first follow - up observations of this remarkable source using the 100-m diameter national radio astronomy observatory green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "here we concentrate on the properties of the pulsar `` a '' eclipse . from observations at the parkes and lovell telescopes , @xcite have already established that the eclipse has duration 2030  s and is roughly independent of frequency .",
    "the greater sensitivity of the observations described here reveal that the eclipse duration is in fact slightly but significantly dependent on radio frequency , as well as demonstrate for the first time that the eclipse is asymmetric .",
    "our observations with the gbt were promptly scheduled as a nrao rapid response science program four times in 2003 december and once in 2004 january and made use of receivers at 427 , 820 and 1400  mhz .",
    "the observational details are summarized in table  [ ta : obs ] .",
    "the 427 and 820 mhz receivers were located at the prime focus of the gbt , are cooled fet amplifiers , and have approximate system temperatures of 57  k and 25  k , respectively .",
    "the 1400 mhz receiver was located at the gregorian focus and is a cooled hfet amplifier with system temperature of 20  k. all provide one beam and are sensitive to orthogonal polarizations .",
    "signals from the receivers are transferred from the telescope to the control room via optical fibre .",
    "the data reported on here were acquired with a single berkeley - caltech pulsar machine ( bcpm ) .",
    "the bcpm is an analog / digital filter bank which samples @xmath9 channels using 4 bits at flexible sampling rates and channel bandwidths @xcite . for our observations ,",
    "the two orthogonal polarizations were summed in hardware prior to being written to disk .",
    "the sampling time for all observations was 72  @xmath10s .",
    "the total bandwidth used ( and hence the channel bandwidth ) depended on the observing frequency ( table  [ ta : obs ] ) .",
    "the data were analyzed using the presto software package @xcite .",
    "we dedispersed the data using dispersion measure 48.9115  pc  @xmath11 and did the following analysis on the resulting time series .",
    "first , we folded data obtained within 2  min of pulsar a s eclipse with the ephemeris reported by @xcite using 64 phase bins .",
    "the resulting profile was cross - correlated with a high signal - to - noise template ( obtained using data from several complete orbits at the appropriate radio frequency ) and the temporal offset was recorded .",
    "then , we folded data from within the 2  min of the eclipse again , but in 2-s intervals .",
    "we then determined the pulsed intensity in each 2-s interval , first by aligning the pulse with the template using the previously recorded offset , then by finding the best - fit scale factor between the template and aligned data profile .",
    "the best - fit value was found by @xmath12 minimization , and the equivalent @xmath13 uncertainties determined from the values of the scale factor corresponding to the minimum @xmath12 plus 1 .",
    "note that no effort was made to calibrate the intensities in physical units ; we assume that the telescope gain and system temperatures were constant throughout each observation .",
    "the average pulse arrival time in each 2-s interval was recorded and reduced to the solar system barycenter using the published position for the pulsar @xcite . in this way",
    ", we obtained a pulsed flux intensity time series consisting of a barycentric time and an intensity for each of the 120 2-s intervals around conjunction .",
    "the number of conjunctions observed at each frequency is given in table  [ ta : eclipse ] .",
    "note that we found no evidence for any changes in dispersion measure near eclipse . using the 427  mhz data , we set an upper limit on any dispersion - measure variation on @xmath14-s time scales of 0.016  pc  @xmath11 .",
    "this was done by running the pulsar timing software package tempo on the 427  mhz data ( with eclipse points identified by large arrival - time uncertainty and omitted ) without fitting for any parameters , and taking the largest residual as an upper limit on any delay due to an anomalous dispersion - measure change .",
    "average eclipse light curves for each frequency were obtained by combining results of every observed conjunction and are shown in figure  [ fig : eclipse ] .",
    "the light curve at 427  mhz has more scatter than the other light curves , primarily due to higher levels of sporadic , short - time scale radio interference of unknown origin , particularly during the first orbit .",
    "we detect significant variations in the pulsed emission at the same orbital phase but in different orbits , during the eclipse .",
    "an example of such variability is illustrated in figure  [ fig : variation ] , in which the light curves for the three 1400  mhz eclipses are shown . in the second observed orbit , there is an apparent @xmath15 detection of the pulsar during the nominal eclipse period , as indicated in the figure .",
    "investigation of this 2-s interval s folded profile by eye confirmed that the pulse , with the expected pulse shape and phase ( though appropriately noisy ) , was present ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : variation ] , inset ) . also , in figure  [ fig : eclipse ] , there is emission in the eclipse region both before and after conjunction in the average 427  mhz light curve .",
    "examination by eye confirmed the approximate pulse shape at the expected phase in several individual 2-s intervals in two of the three 427  mhz orbits .",
    "no such pulse appearance was seen in any of the 820  mhz eclipses , however .",
    "several new properties of the eclipse are apparent from figure  1 .",
    "first , the eclipse is clearly asymmetric in that the eclipse ingress is longer in duration than egress .",
    "also , the eclipse appears to last longer post conjunction . to quantify these properties",
    ", we fit the orbit - averaged light curves at each frequency with two functions of the form @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the flux at orbital phase @xmath18 , defined such that conjunction is at @xmath19 .",
    "this function , having two free parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 , has value unity for @xmath22 , zero for @xmath23 , and one half for @xmath24 .",
    "the transition from values near unity to zero occurs in a width @xmath25 .",
    "optimal values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 for eclipse ingress and egress were determined separately for each light curve in figure  1 using straightforward @xmath12 minimization and data in the interval @xmath26 for ingress and @xmath27 for egress . with two free parameters per side ,",
    "the number of degrees of freedom per fit , @xmath28 , was 23 .",
    "the best fits are shown as solid curves in figure  1 ; they generally yield values of reduced @xmath12 near unity , except for the 427  mhz light curve , for which the higher @xmath12 results from the extra scatter noted above .",
    "contours of constant @xmath12 in @xmath20/@xmath21 space were approximately circular , indicating that these parameters were largely independent .",
    "best - fit parameters and @xmath29 values are given in table  [ ta : eclipse ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : freq ] summarizes the results of these fits .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the eclipse fwhm , defined as the sum of ingress and egress values of @xmath30 .",
    "the clear trend in the data indicates that the eclipse duration is frequency - dependent .",
    "indeed the reduced @xmath12 of a fit to the data assuming a simple constant mean value is 6.1 , clearly ruling this model out .",
    "the data are very well fit by a linear model , having slope @xmath3  orbits  mhz@xmath4 , and intercept @xmath31 .",
    "this predicts that the eclipse will disappear at approximately 7.5  ghz , assuming no other eclipse mechanism becomes important . the mean eclipse fwhm duration ,",
    "averaged over these three frequencies , is @xmath2 in orbital phase , or @xmath32",
    "s.    figure  [ fig : freq ] , panel ( b ) , shows ingress and egress values of @xmath21 .",
    "one aspect of the asymmetry of the eclipse is very apparent from this plot : all ingress values of @xmath21 are higher than the egress values .",
    "thus , the pulsar exits eclipse faster than it enters .",
    "we quantify this effect by taking the ratio of the ingress to egress values of @xmath21 , @xmath33 .",
    "we find , for 427 , 820 and 1400  mhz , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "thus , this aspect of the eclipse asymmetry is not dependent on frequency .",
    "the mean @xmath33 is 3.51 ; the uncertainty on this value , estimated from the uncertainties at each frequency , is 0.99 . estimating the uncertainty from the rms scatter in the three values suggests a much smaller uncertainty of 0.15 ; this may be a chance occurence due to small - number statistics .",
    "figure  [ fig : freq ] , panel ( c ) , shows the fitted values of @xmath20 for ingress and egress at each frequency .",
    "clearly , @xmath36 values for egress are systematically larger than for ingress ( fig .",
    "2c ) , demonstrating that the eclipse lasts longer post - conjunction .",
    "note that the latter is _ opposite _ to what would be expected if the @xmath21 asymmetry were the only one present , and hence is a different effect .",
    "we quantify this using the difference between ingress and egress values of @xmath20 . for 427 ,",
    "820 and 1400  mhz , we find differences of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively . thus we find no evidence for frequency dependence of this eclipse asymmetry . that the absolute values of @xmath20 for both ingress and egress decrease significantly with increasing frequency is a restatement of the fact that the eclipse duration decreases with increasing frequency .",
    "the best - fit inclination angle of the system as reported by @xcite is @xmath40 .",
    "given the measured projected semi - major axis of pulsar a s orbit , this implies that a s beam must pass within 0.07  lt - s of pulsar b. the latter has light - cylinder radius @xmath41  lt - s .",
    "thus , if b s magnetosphere were unperturbed , then a s beam as observed by us would have passed well within its light cylinder and through its magnetosphere",
    ". however , as discussed by @xcite , given the relative spin - down luminosities of the two pulsars , with a s being a factor of @xmath423625 greater than b s , it seems inevitable that a s wind has disrupted b s outer magnetosphere at least halfway inside b s light cylinder and possibly further out than a s beam passes at conjunction . at a s conjunction ,",
    "the relative transverse velocities of the pulsars is 680  km  s@xmath4 , so the eclipse duration implies an approximately constant physical size of the eclipsing region of 18,100  km , or 0.060  lt - s , comparable to the estimated 0.07  lt - s impact parameter , though in a direction parallel to the orbital plane .",
    "this clearly implies an eclipse region that is much smaller than b s unperturbed magnetosphere .",
    "synchrotron absorption in a shock heated `` magnetosheath '' surrounding and containing b s magnetosphere is a possible model for the a eclipse ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* arons et al . , in preparation ) . a s wind",
    "probably confines b s magnetosphere on the side facing a ( which changes periodically with b s rotation over 2.7  s ) such that the latter likely resembles a time - dependent variant of the earth s magnetosphere : compressed on the side facing the source of the wind ( the sun in the terrestrial case , a in this case ) with a magnetotail on the opposite side . the plasma from a passes through a bow shock which spreads and weakens with distance down the flanks of the tail .",
    "the wind plasma from a which passes through the bow shock , flows in a magnetosheath layer between the bow shock and the magnetopause current layer that confines b s magnetosphere .",
    "if the bow shock compresses and heats the a pulsar s wind plasma as if it occurred in a weakly magnetized , semi - infinite flow , then synchrotron absorption in this shock heated plasma can account for the strong eclipse of a by b , albeit for surprisingly high pair densities in a s wind @xcite .",
    "the dimensions of the magnetopause and bow shock on the side facing a , along with the impact parameter of the line - of - sight with respect to b at conjunction , are such that a s radio beam can pass through the northernmost or southernmost extremities of the magnetosheath layer ( where north or south means with respect to the orbital plane . )",
    "such a scenario is consistent with the sharp edge and mildly frequency - dependent shape of the eclipse , since the synchrotron absorption optical depths at the observation frequencies used in this study are large and the shock causes the plasma density and relativistic temperature to jump up sharply across the thin shock layer .",
    "the eclipse - to - eclipse variations and occasional appearances of the pulse during the nominal eclipse region suggest a changing eclipse medium . if pulsar b is an oblique rotator , it is possible that the rotation of its magnetosphere causes the magnetospheric and bow shock shapes to be asymmetric on average between ingress and egress by amounts which account for the observed asymmetries .",
    "if this picture and physical model is correct , one reaches the interesting conclusion that a s wind shocks as if it is not strongly magnetized at a distance of only @xmath42750 times its light cylinder radius .",
    "previous conclusions regarding pulsar wind magnetization have been derived from the behavior of relativistic winds as they pass through their termination shocks in pulsar wind nebulae ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) , located at much larger distances ( typically @xmath43 light cylinder radii ) from their driving pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the above a eclipse model ( see arons et al . , in preparation ) predicts that at sufficiently high radio frequencies , the eclipse will clear , consistent with the observed frequency dependence of the eclipse duration . for nominal , highly simplified models , transparency might appear at frequencies above 510  ghz , roughly quantitatively consistent with the observed frequency dependence extrapolation .",
    "if the impact parameter of the line - of - sight with respect to b during eclipse is sufficiently small , cyclotron scattering within b s magnetosphere might also contribute to the high - frequency opacity .",
    "however , nominal values for the geometry suggest this to be unlikely . in addition , the eclipse duration and morphology should change with time on few - year time scales as relativistic periastron precession , and , perhaps more importantly , geodetic precession , which is expected to be very important in this system @xcite , change the alignment of the pulsars .",
    "this will alter both our viewing vantage point and the dynamic pressure of a s wind on b at conjunction .",
    "the durations of pulsar a ingress and egress are comparable to the rotational period of b. as b s magnetosphere could well present a different response to a s wind pressure depending on b s rotational phase , significantly different a eclipse behavior from orbit to orbit might be expected .",
    "a higher time resolution investigation with higher sensitivity may reveal b phase dependent effects on the eclipse .",
