    "we have found some deviations from standard cosmology by modifications of 4-dimensional einstein equations on the brane@xcite , even for the case there is a scalar field in bulk@xcite",

    "we show that the oscillation we find in sec [ reheat2 ] , is a proper oscillation around a static stable domain wall . to show it",
    ", we perturb the static domain wall solution ( [ 2 _ ] ) as @xmath193 in this appendix , we use the dimensionless variables rescaled by @xmath21 . substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) and linearizing it , we obtain @xmath194 setting @xmath195 and introducing new variable @xmath196 , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ 8 _ ] ) as @xmath197f=0\\ .\\ ] ] the solution is given by the associated legendre function .",
    "imposing the boundary condition ( @xmath198 as @xmath199 ) , we have two regular solutions ; @xmath200 with @xmath201 and @xmath202 with @xmath112 .    for the former mode",
    ", it just corresponds to a boost of a kink solution in the @xmath19 direction , because we find @xmath203 .",
    "the latter one is the oscillation mode which we find in sec [ numer ] .",
    "in fact , taking the average over 10 cycles in the oscillation after the collision in fig . [ 11 ] , we obtain the mean angular frequency is about @xmath204 , which is very close to @xmath205 .",
    "the ratio is about 0.96 .",
    "we also evaluate the angular frequency for other cases .",
    "we find @xmath206 for fig .",
    "[ 12 ] , @xmath207 for fig . [ 11.5 ] , and @xmath208 for fig .",
    "[ 13 ] . from the figures",
    ", we also find that the amplitude of oscillation gets larger as the incident velocity is faster .",
    "this is because the excitation energy of a wall at the collision will be large for a large velocity .",
