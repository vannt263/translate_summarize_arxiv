    "an euclidean tiling of the plane is said to have the finite local complexity property ( flc for short ) if for any ball of radius @xmath0 there is a finite number of patterns of diameter less than @xmath0 up to a group of motion , usually translation .",
    "a tiling has such property if all its tiles are translation copies of a finite number of prototiles and if the tiles match edge to edge .",
    "the theory of @xmath1-algebra and k - theory for aperiodic euclidean tilings satisfying this property is well - established .",
    "non flc tilings on the other hand , have their own peculiarities and as a whole are not well - understood .",
    "the focus of this article is on non flc tilings with simple combinatorics , on a conformal pentagonal tiling of the plane described in @xcite which was studied by kenneth stephenson , philip l. bowers , bill floyd , and others .",
    "the geometry imposed on such tiling has its origins in the theory of circle packing .",
    "the result is a beautiful tiling , but its geometry prevents us from studying it with the standard tiling tools . in @xcite , we showed that the flc property with respect to this geometry , is useless , for it can not be used to construct a compact topological space .",
    "thus we have to abandon the notion of flc with respect to the set of conformal isomorphisms that are defined between open subsets of the plane .",
    "instead , we embark in a new quest of investigating the pentagonal tiling from a new perspective , from its combinatorics equipped with a simpler geometry , one where the combinatorics play just as big a role . such combinatorial tiling we name it @xmath2",
    ". we will show that @xmath2 has flc with respect to the set of isomorphisms that are defined between subcomplexes of @xmath2 .",
    "such tiling is flc but is no longer a tiling of the plane .",
    "it is a tiling of a surface .",
    "it is natural to ask how much of the standard tiling theory can be transferred to this world .",
    "this question is the driving force in the development of this work .",
    "it turns out that many results of the standard tiling theory can be carried out in a natural way for the pentagonal tiling in the new setting , but they also pose challenges .",
    "an aperiodic flc euclidean tiling gives rise to a groupoid and a compact topological space with the action of translation , and so a dynamical system .",
    "such action comes in handy for showing that the classifying space of the groupoid is the topological space .",
    "it follows that the k - theory of the topological space is the same as the k - theory of the @xmath1-algebra of the groupoid .",
    "non flc tilings , on the other hand , are studied individually , since traditional techniques do not apply even for tilings with simple combinatorics , like the mentioned conformally regular pentagonal tiling of the plane in @xcite . for such tiling",
    "we can construct a natural groupoid and a compact topological space but it is missing the action .",
    "this poses a challenge for proving that the classifying space of the groupoid is the topological space .",
    "i raised this question during my talk in the conference `` non standard hierarchical tilings '' held in copenhagen that i co - organized in september 2012 .",
    "+ this work is divided into two sections .",
    "the first section provides the basic terminology and results for investigating the combinatorial pentagonal tiling @xmath2 , which is a cw - complex homeomorphic to the plane and defined via a subdivision rule , and such tiling is shown in figure [ manyballs ] . here , we define what we mean with a ball on @xmath2 , a patch of @xmath2 , a supertile of @xmath2 , and so on . in theorem [ t :",
    "kflc ] we show that @xmath2 is @xmath3 with respect to the set of isomorphisms that are defined between subcomplexes of @xmath2 .",
    "next , we decorate @xmath2 by decorating its subdivision rule .",
    "subsection [ subs : possibledecoratedsubstitutions ] shows that there is only two good possible choices for decorating the subdivision rule , and proposition [ p : uniquedecorationonk ] shows that the chosen decorated subdivision rule induces a unique decoration on @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of the decorations on @xmath2 is to destroy local symmetries .",
    "many properties of the decorations of @xmath2 are summarized in lemma [ l : possibledecorationsve ] . the main result in this section is proposition [ p : norotationsonpatchesofk ] , which shows that we can not `` rotate '' a patch of @xmath2 with respect to any vertex of the patch .    in the second section ,",
    "we construct the discrete hull @xmath4 for the tiling , which is a topological space whose elements are basically tilings that look locally the same as the tiling itself .",
    "we make distinctions between elements of this space to the level of vertices , hence the use of the word discrete in the name . equipping it with an ultrametric @xmath5",
    "we show it is compact .",
    "moreover , we define a subdivision map on it , which turns out to be continuous , injective , but not surjective . in theorem [ t :",
    "xicantor ] we show that @xmath4 is a cantor space , the main result of this article .",
    "a considerable amount of work ( and good ideas ) goes into finding the right definition of the discrete hull , so that we could construct an tale equivalence relation on it and extend it to a continuous hull - results that will be covered in other articles .",
    "the main reason for adding decoration to the tiles is precisely to accomplish this task .",
    "simple as it may seem , the definition of the discrete hull is the fruit of many failed attempts and contradictions found during its construction , some of which are described at the beginning of section two .",
    "elements of the discrete hull are formally isomorphism classes of cw - complexes homeomorphic to the plane , locally isomorphic to @xmath2 , and with a distinguished vertex . in these attempts , we tried distinguished faces instead of distinguished vertices , or distinguished faces and vertices instead of just distinguished vertices , but we stick to distinguished vertices because in this setting things made sense more quickly , even though another setting could pay off better in the long run .",
