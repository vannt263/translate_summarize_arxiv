    "thanks to their extreme brightness , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) can be utilized as powerful probes of star and galaxy formation at high redshift , including during the epoch of reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , spectroscopy of the optical / near - ir afterglow emission",
    "can provide an unambiguous and precise spectroscopic redshift , as well as a measurement of the host galaxy interstellar medium ( ism ) properties _ independent of the host galaxy brightness _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this unique insight can then be combined with multi - wavelength photometric follow - up of the host galaxies to study properties such as their stellar mass and star formation activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , direct galaxy studies at these redshifts rely either on photometric redshifts ( the ly@xmath12 break technique ; lbgs ) , and are therefore limited to bright objects usually with no subsequent spectroscopic confirmation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or on narrow - band ly@xmath12 imaging ( ly@xmath12 emitters ; laes ) , which also requires subsequent spectroscopic confirmation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of laes",
    ", the reliance on ly@xmath12 emission may also inhibit detections during the epoch of reionization due to significant scattering and absorption of ly@xmath12 photons by the neutral intergalactic medium ; the same effect also inhibits the success of lbg spectroscopic confirmation , which also relies on detection of the ly@xmath12 line .",
    "similarly , the reliance on rest - frame uv and ly@xmath12 emission bias both the lbg and lae selection against dusty environments .",
    "moreover , for both lbgs and laes , measurements of the ism properties are beyond the reach of current instrumentation since the relevant rest - frame optical emission lines are redshifted into the mid - ir .",
    "an alternative technique of submillimeter color selection has also led to the identification of a few high redshift submillimeter - bright galaxies ( smgs ) , with spectroscopic confirmation via co and [ ] emission lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , these extremely luminous and highly star forming galaxies are exceedingly rare and do not shed light on the bulk of the galaxy population .",
    "thus , spectroscopically - confirmed grb host galaxies at high redshift provide an attractive sample for multi - wavelength follow - up observations .    in this context ,",
    "the advent of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) makes it possible for the first time to probe obscured star formation in high - redshift galaxies to a sensitivity level of only a few m@xmath6 yr@xmath8 , or an integrated ir luminosity of @xmath13 l@xmath6 .",
    "previously , only rare smgs with @xmath14 l@xmath6 ( ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ; ulirgs ) and correspondingly high star formation rates of @xmath15 m@xmath6 yr@xmath8 were accessible ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the long term",
    ", alma observations of grb host galaxies with measured ism metallicities will shed light on the relations between metallicity , dust content , and obscured star formation at redshifts that are inaccessible with other techniques ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) .",
    "this will also provide a comparison with the rest - frame fir properties of lbgs and laes , although none have been individually detected to date at @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    here , we present deep alma observations of the host galaxy of the most distant spectroscopically - confirmed burst to date   at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the observations are aimed at reaching a rest - frame fir luminosity level below that of a luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg : @xmath16 l@xmath6 ) .",
    "we also present _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ rest - frame optical observations to constrain the stellar mass of the host galaxy . the alma and _ spitzer _ observations and data analysis are described in  [ sec : obs ] . in  [ sec : prop ] we use the data to constrain the host galaxy properties , while in  [ sec : comp ] we compare these results to millimeter studies of laes , lbgs , and smgs at @xmath11 .",
    "the discovery and redshift determination of  are presented in @xcite , who find @xmath17 .",
    "the position of the afterglow is r.a.= , decl.= ( j2000 ) with an uncertainty of about @xmath18 in each coordinate .",
    "the host galaxy was previously observed with the _ hubble space telescope _ wide - field camera 3 ( _ hst_/wfc3 ) in the f110w and f160w filters , leading to non - detections @xcite .",
    "it was also observed with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , yielding non - detections of rest - frame 850 @xmath3 m continuum emission and co ( 3 - 2 ) emission @xcite .",
    "the continuum limits are summarized in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "alma band 6 ( 222 ghz ) observations were carried out with @xmath19 12-m diameter antennas in five observing blocks spread over 12 days on 2013 november 18 , 21 , and 30 ut ( cycle 1 ) .",
    "the 2 ghz wide spectral windows were set to central frequencies of 213 , 215 , 229 and 231 ghz .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 163 min after data flagging .",
    "we performed data calibration and imaging using the common astronomy software application ( casa ) .",
    "the gain calibration utilized j0854 + 2006 , while bandpass calibration utilized one of j0522@xmath203627 , j0538@xmath204405 , j1037@xmath202934 , or j1058 + 0133 in each observing block .",
    "absolute flux calibration was performed using observations of the solar system objects ceres , ganymede , or pallas .",
    "we found some minor variations in the resulting fluxes of j0854 + 2006 between the observing blocks , likely due to the use of asteroids , which have uncertain flux models .",
    "we therefore used ganymede when possible and ceres to determine and manually set the flux for j0854 + 2006 in each epoch .",
    "the overall uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration is about @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting combined continuum map ( natural weighting without primary beam correction ) has an rms noise of @xmath22 @xmath3jy beam@xmath8 for a synthesized beam size ( full - width at half maximum ) of @xmath23 ( figure  [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "no source is detected at the location of ( with a flux density at the source location of @xmath24 @xmath3jy ) , leading an upper limit of @xmath25 @xmath3jy ( @xmath1 ; table  [ tab : data ] ) .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations were obtained during the warm mission ( ddt program 538 ) with the infrared array camera ( irac ) at @xmath26 @xmath3 m on 2010 january 26 and 27 ut .",
    "each observation consisted of 650 100-s frames ( @xmath27 s on source ) , for a combined on - source time of @xmath28 hr .",
    "we analyzed the data using the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) pipeline , including corrections for bright star image artifacts ( muxbleed and pulldown ) with dark and sky background subtraction .",
    "we carried out astrometric alignment utilizing stars in common with the sloan digital survey survey database , and created a combined mosaic of the individual frames on a @xmath29 pixel grid .",
    "we also produced a pair of split images , each with half of the frames , and used the difference in these split images to produce a noise map .",
    "the resulting uncertainty is about 2 times higher than that derived from pure pixel statistics in the vicinity of the source .",
    "we do not detect significant emission at the location of ( figure  [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "there is no evidence for significant source confusion at this location , in agreement with the _",
    "hst_/wfc3 images of the field @xcite . from the noise maps , we find that the @xmath30 point source sensitivity at the location of  is 27 njy .",
    "photometry in a @xmath31 radius aperture yields a @xmath26 @xmath3 m flux density of @xmath32 njy , after aperture corrections .",
    "we therefore place an upper limit on the brightness of the host of @xmath33njy ( @xmath1 ; table  [ tab : data ] ) .",
    "the host galaxy of  remains undetected in our alma and _ spitzer _ observations .",
    "the flux density limits are plotted in the left panel of figure  [ fig : seds ] .",
    "converted to rest - frame spectral luminosity , the non - detections correspond to @xmath34 erg s@xmath8 hz@xmath8 and @xmath35 erg s@xmath8 hz@xmath8 , respectively ( right panel of figure  [ fig : seds ] , and table  [ tab : data ] ) .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : seds ] are the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of several local galaxies redshifted to @xmath0 : the ulirg arp220 , the starburst m82 , the low metallicity dwarf galaxy izw18 , and the host galaxy of grb980425 ( @xmath36 mpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "our alma non - detection corresponds to a luminosity that is about 20 times fainter than that of arp220 and about 1.6 times higher than that of m82 .",
    "we also provide a comparison with the galaxy templates of @xcite , which are based on eleven local star forming lirgs and ulirgs , and find that the alma non - detection corresponds to @xmath37 l@xmath6 .    for the arp220 template ,",
    "the alma non - detection provides a much more stringent limit than the hst and _ spitzer _ limits , which only rule out a luminosity comparable to that of arp220 .",
    "the alma constraints are also more stringent for the m82 template , although only by about a factor of 2 . for an sd galaxy template from the spitzer wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ) library , the alma , _ hst _ , and _ spitzer _",
    "data all place comparable limits on the host sed .",
    "on the other hand , for the izw18 template , which has weak fir emission , the _ hst _ limits place a much more stringent constraint than the alma data , by about a factor of 600 .",
    "the same is true for the grb980425 host galaxy template , which is about 15 times fainter than the alma limit when scaled to the _ hst _ limits .    using the standard modified blackbody sed of dust emission , with a dust temperature range of @xmath38 k and @xmath39 ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", the alma non - detection corresponds to an upper limit on the integrated ir luminosity of @xmath40 l@xmath6 ; the lower bound on the blackbody temperature is set by the cosmic microwave background temperature @xmath41 k @xcite .",
    "the ir luminosity upper limit is thus a few times lower than the scale for a lirg , and agrees well with the comparison to the @xcite templates .",

    "the limit on the _ unobscured _ star formation rate from the _ hst _ rest - frame uv non - detection is @xmath43 m@xmath6 yr@xmath8 .",

    "the inferred host galaxy properties are summarized in table  [ tab : host ] .",
    "to place the non - detection of the host galaxy of  in the context of millimeter studies of high - redshift galaxies , we summarize below previous observational efforts to detect and study distant laes , lbgs , and smgs ; the information is summarized in figure  [ fig : gals ] .",
    "we first note that , at present , alma observations of only two other galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts of @xmath47 have been published : the laes `` himiko '' at @xmath48 @xcite and iok-1 at @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "neither source was detected , with resulting @xmath1 flux density limits of @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath3jy , respectively . the flux density and integrated ir luminosity limits for these two laes are shallower than those achieved in our observations ; see figure  [ fig : gals ] . however , it is important to note that himiko and iok-1 are significantly more luminous than the host of  in the rest - frame uv and optical , by a factor of @xmath52 ( figure  [ fig : seds ] ) , with inferred unobscured star formation rates of @xmath53 m@xmath6 yr@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "thus , in terms of the ratio of fir to uv luminosity , the limits for himiko and iok-1 are more constraining than those for the host of",
    ".    beyond the alma observations of @xmath47 galaxies , there are shallower observations from other millimeter facilities .",

    "@xcite used a wide range of facilities to study the bright smg hfls3 at @xmath60 , discovered in the herschel multi - tiered extragalactic survey , and found @xmath61 l@xmath6 .",

    "in addition to the alma observations , @xcite studied id141 , a lensed galaxy at @xmath81 from the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey , and inferred @xmath82 l@xmath6 ; the range of values accounts for the unknown lensing magnification factor .",

    "finally , two other grb host galaxies at lower redshifts have been observed with alma @xcite .",
    "the host of grb021004 at @xmath92 was not detected , with a resulting limit of @xmath93 l@xmath6 ( @xmath94 m@xmath6 yr@xmath8 ) .",

    "prior to alma , a few grb host galaxies at @xmath99 were detected in the submillimeter and radio bands @xcite , some with inferred ir luminosities that exceed that of arp220 .",
    "however , most grb host galaxies were not detected at a comparable level to arp220 or fainter @xcite , ruling out a dominant ulirg host population .",
    "thus , in comparison to the previous studies of @xmath11 spectroscopically - confirmed field galaxies , as well as other grb host galaxies , our alma observations of the host of  represent the deepest limit to date in terms of flux density , spectral luminosity , and integrated ir luminosity ( figure  [ fig : gals ] ) .",
    "we present alma and _ spitzer _ observations of the host galaxy of  at @xmath0 , the highest redshift spectroscopically - confirmed galaxy observed with these facilities to date .",
    "the host galaxy remains undetected at rest - frame wavelength of @xmath100 @xmath3 m ( alma ) and @xmath101 @xmath3 m ( _ spitzer _ ) .",
    "the resulting limit on the integrated ir luminosity is @xmath37 l@xmath6 , corresponding to @xmath102 m@xmath6 yr@xmath8 of obscured star formation ; scaling the sed of the low metallicity dwarf galaxy izw18 relaxes the star formation rate upper limit to @xmath103 m@xmath6 yr@xmath8 . in addition , based on the _ spitzer _ and _ hst _ non - detections we place a limit on the host galaxy stellar mass of @xmath10 m@xmath6 ( 100 myr old stellar population with constant star formation rate ) .",
    "the limit on the unobscured star formation rate based on _ hst _ rest - frame uv observations is @xmath104 m@xmath6 yr@xmath8 .",
    "we additionally compare our alma non - detection to millimeter observations of spectroscopically - confirmed galaxies at @xmath11 ( undertaken with alma and other facilities ) and show that the limit on the host of  is the deepest to date compared to any published observations . at this redshift range",
    "only smgs have been convincingly detected , while individual lbgs and laes have so far escaped detection even with alma ( a marginal detection of lbgs at @xmath89 in stacked scuba-2 observations has been reported by @xcite ) .",
    "the only comparable limits to ours are based on alma observations of two laes at @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it is quite remarkable that we were able to reach a brightness limit of about 20 times lower than arp220 ( and comparable to m82 ) at @xmath0 in only 3 hours of on - source time and with a subset of the alma antennas . on the other hand ,",
    "if typical high redshift galaxies have seds similar to the local dwarf izw18 or the host galaxy of grb980425 , then much deeper alma observations will be required to detect their fir emission .",
