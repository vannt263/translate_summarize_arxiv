    "various models of random copolymers have been extensively studied using theoretical @xcite and numerical @xcite methods . it has been found that even simple models exhibit a rich variety of conformational states leading to quite a complicated phase diagram .",
    "most of the theoretical results have been obtained within the replica approach @xcite for directed polymers in random media @xcite and for self  interacting copolymers under the assumption of the ground state dominance and constant density approximations for gaussian disorder @xcite .",
    "computer simulations @xcite have qualitatively confirmed some of the theoretical predictions .",
    "in this paper we study the complete phase diagram of a random copolymer chain with attractive and repulsive units .",
    "it is believed that such studies have application in the field of protein folding and related subjects @xcite .",
    "thus we apply a gaussian variational approach based on a generic quadratic trial hamiltonian in terms of monomer fourier coordinates of replicas , which is an alternative to the standard one using the density overlap function as the replica order parameter and constant density approximation .",
    "a similar approach was applied to directed polymers and manifolds in random media @xcite .",
    "the method has the advantage that it allows us to incorporate fluctuations of the density , determined self  consistently , and to study collapse , phase separation and glass transitions within the same mean field theory .",
    "note that the self  consistent method has been applied to various other problems at equilibrium @xcite and in kinetics @xcite of homo and block copolymers and to directed polymers in random media @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to represent the hamiltonian as the sum of two parts , @xmath0 .",
    "the first is purely homopolymeric and the second is related to the quenched disorder .",
    "thus , @xmath1 @xmath2 where the connectivity constant is @xmath3 , with @xmath4 being the bond length . here the @xmath5 denote the virial coefficients and the curly braces indicate that the terms with coinciding indices are excluded .",
    "the matrix of two  body interactions may be written @xcite via the quenched random variables @xmath6 , @xmath7 where the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 may be expressed in terms of , for example , @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the case of only two monomer types .",
    "the average over the quenched disorder is performed by introducing replicas @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 are respectively the partition function of the system and the effective hamiltonian in the replica space .",
    "here the bar stands for the average over disorder .    for simplicity we assume the distribution of @xmath16 to be gaussian with mean",
    "value @xmath17 and variance @xmath18 , @xmath19 however other distributions , for example the binary distribution , can be considered .",
    "averaging over the quenched disorder produces a compact expression for the effective hamiltonian in the replica space , @xmath20 @xmath21 where we assume @xmath22 , @xmath23 and that the hamiltonian is regularized by introduction of a short distance cutoff .",
    "this choice of parameters in the matrix of interactions corresponds to the amphiphilic model , in which monomers of @xmath24type attract each other and monomers of @xmath25type repel each other .",
    "we note here that the case @xmath26 requires some additional treatment , for example application of the perturbation expansion of the matrices @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29",
    "it is useful to introduce the fourier coordinates of the monomer positions . for ring polymers",
    "the appropriate fourier transform is defined as @xmath30 and the generalization to the case of open chain is straightforward . the standard gibbs ",
    "bogoliubov variational principle gives the estimate for the free energy , @xmath31 we choose the trial hamiltonian as a quadratic form , which is standard in the polymer literature @xcite , but with @xmath32dependence of all variational parameters @xmath33 where the effective potential matrix is to be taken non - diagonal in the replica indices and diagonal in the chain index due to the assumption of translational invariance along the chain after integrating out the disorder .",
    "we note here that formally one has to add a small mass term @xmath34 to the effective potential @xmath35 in ( [ trial ] ) for regularisation @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath36 is assumed to be taken at the final stage of calculations .",
    "averaging ( [ heffect ] ) over the statistical ensemble ( [ trial ] ) we obtain the effective free energy of the following form @xmath37 here we introduced @xmath38 and matrices of spatial @xmath39 and fourier @xmath40 monomer correlations @xmath41    the procedure of performing the limit @xmath42 is well known from studies of spin glass systems @xcite .",
    "to do so we assume that @xmath43 is a parisi  type hierarchical matrix parametrised by @xmath44 , @xmath45 $ ] , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are correlation functions for monomers from the same replica and from different replicas respectively .",
    "finally , we obtain the effective free energy per replica in the limit @xmath42 , which is convenient to represent as a sum of two terms , @xmath48   + f_1[\\tilde{{\\cal f}}_q , { \\cal f}_q(u)]\\biggr)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term , @xmath49 , coincides with the annealed effective free energy , @xmath50 where @xmath51 are determinants of @xmath52-matrices @xmath53 the second term , @xmath54 , is determined purely by the quenched disorder , @xmath55(u)}{1-\\langle{\\cal r}_q\\rangle}\\biggr ] \\\\ & + & \\frac{{\\tilde\\delta}^2}{2!(2\\pi)^{6/2 } } \\int d{s_0}d{s_1}d{s_2}\\int^1_0 du \\ , [ { \\tilde{\\cal d}_{s_0s_1 } } \\tilde{\\cal d}_{s_1s_2}- { { \\cal d}^2_{s_0s_1s_2}}(u)]^{-3/2 } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where by definition for any arbitrary matrix @xmath9 : @xmath56(u)=-\\int^u_0 dv \\,a(v ) + ua(u)\\,,\\\\ \\mbox{and } \\nonumber\\\\   & & 0\\leq { \\cal r}_q(u ) = { \\cal f}_q(u ) / \\tilde{{\\cal f}}_q < 1 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we introduce @xmath57 , which gives the measure of correlations between different replicas relatively to correlations in the same replica and allows the division on `` annealed '' and `` quenched '' parts ( [ effen ] ) .",
    "the effective free energy has to be minimized with respect to @xmath46 and maximized with respect to @xmath47 with the constraints @xmath58 .",
    "the latter physically means that monomer coordinates correlations between different replicas are always weaker than those in the same replica .",
    "alternatively these constraints can be derived if we require the matrices @xmath59 and @xmath60 to have positive eigenvalues for arbitrary integer @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and all non  diagonal elements of the matrices @xmath59 to be negative to match the sign of the corresponding non  diagonal terms in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "usually one is interested in such quantities as radius of gyration @xmath63 , end  to  end distance , phase separation order parameters or the average value @xmath64 of an overlap between different replicas @xmath65 , for example , @xmath66 all these can be treated as observables and evaluated by introducing appropriate external fields to the partition function .",
    "the model we consider exhibits a strong tendency for phase  separation .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath67 can be considered as a measure of phase separation , where @xmath68 is the difference of the square radii of gyration in the case of two letter copolymers with equal concentrations of both monomer types , @xmath69 . introducing",
    "the term @xmath70 into the hamiltonian one obtains @xmath71    to determine the freezing transition one may study the change of the average overlap among replicas @xmath64 as well as the eigenvalues of the matrix of the second derivatives of the free energy ( [ effen ] ) with respect to all @xmath72 and @xmath47 , hessian @xmath73 .",
    "the solution we are looking for is a saddle point with the positive eigenvalues of @xmath73 corresponding to @xmath72 and negative ones corresponding to @xmath47 .",
    "as one can see from the numerical analysis , the solution with all @xmath74 , no correlations among replicas , is not a saddle point of the type mentioned above for the variance of the disorder @xmath75 larger than some particular critical value @xmath76 .",
    "the latter can vary with a change in the values of the virial coefficients .",
    "to analyze system numerically one has to substitute integration by summation in ( [ effen ] ) , see appendix a for details . in principle",
    "we can evaluate the effective free energy for any finite number of steps in the parisi scheme . in practice",
    "this means the introduction of a large number of variational parameters .",
    "if one has a polymer of length @xmath77 monomers and applies the @xmath78step parisi scheme , then one has to analyze a set of approximately @xmath79 nonlinear algebraic equations .",
    "therefore , we apply a minimal one  step parisi scheme , which still incorporates all the main features of the exact solution and allows one to locate the onset of the transition to phases with broken replica symmetry if such exists .",
    "thus we approximate @xmath47 by the step function @xmath80    in one  step approximation :    @xmath81 \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{3}{2}\\sum_q \\left [ \\frac{x-1}{x}\\log\\biggl ( 1 -{\\cal r}^{(1)}_q\\biggr)+ \\frac{{\\cal r}^{(0)}_q}{1-(1-x){\\cal r}^{(1)}_q - x{\\cal r}^{(0)}_q } \\right ] % \\\\ \\\\ & & + \\frac{{\\tilde\\delta}^2}{2!(2\\pi)^{6/2 } } \\sum _ { \\ { ijk \\ } } \\biggl [ ( 1-x){q^{(1)}_{ijk}}^{-3/2 } + x{q^{(0)}_{ijk}}^{-3/2 } % - { { \\cal q}^{(0)}_{12}}^{-3/2 } \\biggr]\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ & & q^{(s)}_{ijk}={\\tilde{\\cal d}_{ij}}\\tilde{\\cal d}_{jk}-{{\\cal d}_{ijk}^{(s)}}^{2}\\ , , ~{\\cal d}_{ijk}^{(s)}=\\sum_q d^{(q)}_{ijk}{\\cal f}^{(s)}_q\\,,\\quad s=0,1\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the following we restrict ourselves to the choice of parameters : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , which provide the scaling units of energy and length ; and we set @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "note that the zero ",
    "modes @xmath86 and @xmath87 do not contribute to the mean energy of the system describing diffusion of the center of mass of the polymer chain .",
    "the system exhibits two different types of behavior above and below the freezing transition . above the freezing temperature ,",
    "the monomer coordinates correlation function for monomers from the same replica , @xmath72 , closely coincides with that for annealed disorder , whilst the monomer coordinates correlation functions for monomer from different replicas , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , possess only trivial solutions , namely : @xmath90 .",
    "the coil and globular states are similar to the homopolymer coil and liquid  like globule states respectively .",
    "the trial hamiltonian is diagonal in the replica space and the free energy differs from the annealed one by the term @xmath91 which remains regular in the whole range of the parameter space and becomes negligibly small in the region of small @xmath75 .",
    "the situation changes around some critical value of the dispersion of disorder @xmath92 , at which point the solution yields nontrivial values for the correlation functions @xmath88 and @xmath89 and the parameter @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the onset of the freezing transition can be seen clearly from the behavior of both @xmath93 and the set of @xmath94 , where they start to change rapidly .",
    "the typical behavior of the correlation functions for monomers from different replicas can be seen in figs  1 and  2 .",
    "1 presents the correlation function for monomers from the same group of replicas , @xmath95 , and from different groups of replicas , @xmath96 , and the parameter @xmath93 versus the dispersion of disorder @xmath75 at fixed values of the other parameters in the free energy ( [ effen ] ) . strictly speaking",
    "the solution below freezing is valid only in the vicinity of the transition line , though we draw it for a wide range of the dispersion of disorder , keeping in mind that more steps in the parisi scheme are required to describe the properties of the frozen phase .",
    "after the freezing transition the coordinates of monomers from different replicas become correlated which results in a decrease of the entropy of the system . the symmetry among replicas is spontaneously broken , the correlations between the positions of the monomers from the same group of replicas are higher than those between the positions of the monomers from different groups .",
    "2 presents the profile of the replica s correlation functions @xmath97 and @xmath98 in the chain index @xmath32 .",
    "there are no correlations for large @xmath32 , @xmath99 for ring polymers , between different replicas in the vicinity of the freezing transition although these become non  zero as @xmath100 increases . to locate the onset of the freezing transition only correlations on the first mode , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and the parameter @xmath93 are needed .",
    "this clearly indicates the scale dependence of the freezing due to the topological frustration in the system and is in agreement with the main result of @xcite .",
    "the resulting phase diagram of the random copolymer is represented in fig .",
    "3 . it shows that the collapse can occur in two different ways .",
    "for small values of the variance of the two body interaction , @xmath75 , the coil collapses to the liquid  like globule as the effective two body interaction changes from repulsion to attraction and @xmath103 becomes negative .",
    "for large @xmath75 the effective three body interaction , @xmath104 , changes sign from positive to negative and collapse occurs due to the three body effects @xcite , even when @xmath103 remains positive , but small .",
    "there is also a transition from the liquid  like globule to the frozen globule ( line ( f ) in fig .  2 ) .",
    "for very large @xmath105 there is an indication that the copolymer chain collapses directly to the frozen phase and that the phase diagram may exhibit a multi - critical point where all three phases , coil , liquid  like and frozen globule coexist .",
    "the freezing transition line on the fig 3 scales approximately as @xmath106 for large negative @xmath103 , where @xmath107 .",
    "the freezing transition line is nearly independent of the third virial coefficient in the region where @xmath108 and increases linearly in @xmath109 when @xmath110 . in a more dense globule ,",
    "i.e. given a bigger negative @xmath111 or smaller @xmath112 , chains undergo a transition from a liquid  like to a frozen globule at smaller values of @xmath75 . both the collapse transition and the freezing transition lines are essentially independent of the size of the chain for sufficiently large degree of polymerization @xmath77 .    in fig .",
    "4 we present the phase separation parameter @xmath68 versus the dispersion @xmath100 , @xmath113 this parameter increases linearly in @xmath75 in the liquid  like globule phase , but remains constant in the frozen phase , whilst @xmath114 reaches a maximum at the freezing transition and starts to decrease slowly in the frozen phase due to the increase in the radius of gyration @xmath63 .",
    "this means that freezing prevents the system from further phase separation and therefore , for example , the observable @xmath68 and its first derivative with respect to @xmath75 can also be used to locate the onset of the freezing transition .",
    "in this paper we have applied a gaussian variational approach to study the phase transitions of random copolymers .",
    "the essential feature of this approach is that it is based on a trial hamiltonian in terms of monomer coordinates rather than density variables .",
    "for this reason it may be used to describe a polymer with arbitrary gaussian disorder across the whole range of the collapse transition .",
    "our equations reduce to the self ",
    "consistency equations for a homopolymer at equilibrium as the variance of the second virial coefficient vanishes .",
    "the most important result is that the freezing transition in the system is scale dependent @xcite .",
    "we have performed a numerical analysis of the free energy in the one  step parisi scheme .",
    "we note here that , firstly , more steps in the parisi scheme may be required to describe the property of the frozen phase and , secondly , the replica symmetrical solution brings qualitatively the same results .",
    "it is believed that the model we have considered can provide a basis for understanding conformational states of biomolecules such as proteins @xcite .",
    "the results for the freezing transition and the phase separation are in agreement with those obtained for this model by other methods @xcite .",
    "we note that the results we have obtained are valid also for binary distribution of disorder , provided that higher virial coefficients remain positive .",
    "however , the whole diagram in this case will incorporate new features , e.g. the explicit dependence of the freezing transition on the chemical composition .",
    "we also note that one of the important drawbacks of the theory is that the gaussian method yields an incorrect flory exponent for a chain in a good solvent .",
    "however , this problem can be resolved in different ways and we refer the reader to the discussion of this point in @xcite .    finally we may comment that despite the limitations , the current approach offers one of the few consistent approaches to the global `` phase '' diagrams of random amphiphilic copolymer chain @xcite .",
