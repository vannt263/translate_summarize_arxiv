    "the @xmath3 process is interesting reaction to test the standard model and any other theory beyond the standard model .",
    "the linear collider would be a good option to study the couplings of gauge bosons in the future .",
    "for instance in ref.@xcite the anomalous coupling in locally su(2 ) @xmath6 u(1 ) invariant effective lagrangian was studied .",
    "other models also lead to anomalous gauge boson coupling .",
    "it was discussed recently @xcite that the @xmath7 reaction is a good case to study experimentally the @xmath8 and @xmath5 couplings almost at present . only photon - photon contribution for the purely exclusive production case",
    "was considered so far .",
    "central exlusive production has been recently an active field of research @xcite .",
    "the exclusive reaction @xmath9 has been intensively studied by the durham group @xcite .",
    "this study was motivated by the clean environment and largely reduced background due to a suppression of @xmath10 production as a consequence of the @xmath11 = 0 rule in the forward limit . during the conference",
    "some results for the @xmath12 production were shown .    in this communication , we discuss exclusive production of @xmath0 pairs in high - energy proton - proton collisions .",
    "the original results have been presented recently in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 process going through the diffractive qcd mechanism with the @xmath14 subprocess naturally constitutes an irreducible background for the exclusive electromagnetic @xmath15 process .",
    "we discuss the contribution of the diffractive mechanism which could potentially shadow the photon - photon fusion .",
    "a schematic diagram for central exclusive diffractive production of @xmath16 pairs in proton - proton scattering @xmath17 is shown in fig .  [ fig : wwcep ] .    the amplitude of the diffractive process at high energy is written as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the polarisation states of the produced @xmath1 bosons , respectively , @xmath20 is the off - diagonal unintegrated gluon distribution function ( ugdf ) .",
    "pair production in @xmath21 collisions.,width=188 ]    the @xmath22 hard subprocess amplitude @xmath23 can be formally written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and the center - of - mass proton energy @xmath26 .",
    "there are two types of diagrams entering the hard subprocess amplitude : triangles and boxes @xcite .",
    "the corresponding amplitudes have been calculated using the mathematica - based formcalc ( fc ) package .",
    "the details are explained in @xcite .",
    "the bare amplitude above is subjected to absorption corrections that depend on the collision energy and typical proton transverse momenta .",
    "the bare cross section is usually multiplied by a rapidity gap survival factor which we take the same as for the higgs boson and @xmath12 production to be @xmath27 at the lhc energy .    the diffractive @xmath2 cep amplitude ( [ ampl ] ) described above is used to calculate the corresponding cross section .",
    "in order to make the calculation feasible we simplify the calculation limiting to the forward region .",
    "the calculation in the full phase space is obtained by assuming exponential dependence in @xmath28 and @xmath29 and assuming no correlation between outgoing protons .",
    "in such an approximate calculation the phase space integral reduces to four dimensions @xcite .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss the @xmath3 mechanism . here",
    "we limit to only standard model amplitude .",
    "the relevant subprocess diagrams are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : gamgam_ww ] .",
    "the cross section for the subprocess can be expressed in terms of mandelstam variables .",
    "subprocess.,width=264 ]    since we concentrate on the diffractive mechanism the cross section for the @xmath4 mechanism is calculated in approximate way .    to calculate differential distributions the following parton formula",
    "is used @xmath30 where @xmath31 are momentum fractions of the fusing gluons .    in our evaluations we use the weizscker - williams equivalent photon fluxes of protons from ref .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : dsig_dpt ] we show distribution in @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) transverse momentum .",
    "the distribution for exclusive diffractive production is much steeper than that for the electromagnetic contribution .",
    "the diffractive contribution peaks at @xmath34 25 gev .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than for the @xmath3 mechanism where the maximum is at @xmath34 40 gev .",
    "the exclusive cross section for photon - photon contribution is at large transverse momenta @xmath35 1 tev smaller only by one order of magnitude than the inclusive @xmath36 component shown for comparision",
    ".     bosons .",
    "the diffractive contribution is shown by the bottom solid line while the @xmath3 contribution by the middle solid line .",
    "the top solid line corresponds to the inclusive gluon - initiated @xmath37 component.,width=188 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : dsig_dmww ] shows distribution in the @xmath38 invariant mass which is particularly important for the new physics searches at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the distribution for the diffractive component drops quickly with the @xmath39 invariant mass . for reference and illustration , we show also distribution when the sudakov form factors in off - diagonal ugdf s is set to one . as can be seen from the figure , the sudakov form factor lowers the cross section by a large factor .",
    "the damping is @xmath39-dependent as can be seen by comparison of the two curves .",
    "we show the full result ( boxes + triangles ) and the result with boxes only which would be complete if the higgs boson does not exist . at high invariant masses ,",
    "the interference of boxes and triangles decreases the cross section even more .",
    "the distribution for the photon - photon component drops very slowly with @xmath39 and at @xmath40 1 tev the corresponding cross section is even bigger than the @xmath41 component to inclusive production of @xmath38 .",
    "invariant mass .",
    "we show both the qcd diffractive contribution and the @xmath42 contribution .",
    "the result when the sudakov form factor is put to one is shown for illustration .",
    "the most upper curve is for the inclusive gluon - initiated @xmath43 component.,width=188 ]",
    "recently ( @xcite ) we have calculated the qcd diffractive contribution to the exclusive @xmath44 process for the first time in the literature with the full one - loop @xmath45 matrix element .",
    "the full amplitude is a sum of two mechanisms .",
    "first component is a virtual ( highly off - shell ) higgs boson production and its subsequent transformation into real @xmath38 pair .",
    "second component relies on the formation of intermediate quark boxes .",
    "we have made first evaluation of differential distributions using amplitudes in the forward limit `` corrected '' off - forward via a simple exponential ( slope dependent ) extrapolation .",
    "distributions in @xmath46-boson transverse momentum and @xmath38 pair invariant mass has been presented here for illustration .",
    "the contribution of triangles ( with the intermediate s - channel higgs boson ) turned out to be smaller than the contribution of boxes .",
    "these results have been compared with the results obtained for purely electromagnetic photon - photon fusion .",
    "we have shown that the diffractive contribution is much smaller than the electromagnetic one .",
    "there are several reasons of the suppression .",
    "since here we have focused on large invariant masses of the @xmath38 system , rather large @xmath47 gluon distributions enter the calculation of the diffractive amplitude .",
    "the gluon densities at such large invariant masses , i.e. large @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are rather small . furthermore relative to the electromagnetic process",
    "the diffractive contribution is strongly damped by the sudakov form factor , soft gap survival probability and optionally ( if higgs boson exists ) by the interference of box and triangle diagrams .    in summary , we have given a new argument for the recent idea that the @xmath7 reaction is a good place for searches beyond standard model as far as four - boson ( anomalous ) coupling is considered .",
