    "high redshift clusters of galaxies have long served as valuable tools to test theories of cosmic structure formation ( e.g. press & schechter 1974 , peebles et al .",
    "1989 , eke et al .",
    "1996 , to mention just a few ) .",
    "measurements of the temperature of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) in distant clusters are particularly important since cluster temperatures are closely related to their mass , as long as these systems are in virial equilibrium .",
    "physical cluster parameters of the highest redshift clusters , measurable by means of deep x - ray observations ( e.g. the luminosity - temperature relation ) , set also strong constraints on the thermodynamical evolution of their gaseous component .",
    "in addition , the measurement of the metal abundance from x - ray spectra in remote bound systems can constrain the mode and epoch of the enrichment of the intracluster gas .    despite their importance , icm properties at high redshift ( @xmath2 ) are still largely unexplored .",
    "this is due to the limited effective area and spatial resolution of the past x - ray missions , as well as to the difficulty of finding x - ray luminous clusters at @xmath2 . indeed",
    "the _ extended medium sensitivity survey _",
    "( emss ; gioia et al . ,",
    "1990 ) carried out with the einstein observatory has detected clusters at redshift up to @xmath11 ( e.g. ms1137 + 6625 at 0.78 and ms1054 - 0321 at z=0.83 , gioia and luppino , 1994 ; donahue et al . ,",
    "1998 ) but the statistics of high - z clusters in the emss is still low with only 6 clusters ( out of a total of about 100 ) at @xmath12 . over the last few years , however , several x - ray cluster surveys based on rosat - pspc data ( the rdcs : rosati et al . , 1995 , 1998 ;",
    "the warps : scharf et al . , 1997 ; the sharc : burke et al . , 1997 ; the 160@xmath13 survey of vikhlinin et al . , 1998 ; the nep : mullis et al . , 1998 ) have changed the observational scenario by collecting sizable samples of distant ( @xmath2 ) systems , thus extending the pioneering work of the emss .",
    "the rosat deep cluster survey ( rdcs , rosati et al .",
    "1995 , 1998 ) has pushed these studies to the faintest fluxes and highest redshifts , with 33 clusters spectroscopically identified to date at @xmath2 , out to @xmath14 ( rosati et al .",
    "1999 ) .    as an alternative method ,",
    "several studies have tried to locate distant clusters around high redshift radio galaxies ( e.g. 3c  324 at @xmath15 , smail & dickinson , 1995 ; 3c  184 at @xmath16 , deltorn et al . 1997 ) .",
    "rosat observations of distant radio galaxies ( crawford & fabian 1996 ; dickinson 1997 ) have provided some evidence that the observed x - ray emission might originate from hot intra - cluster gas .",
    "it remains difficult , however , to reliably measure icm physical parameters in these objects , since one needs to discriminate an absorbed power - law component , due to the radio galaxy s agn , from the thermal component of the putative diffuse icm .",
    "although the number of _ bona - fide _ high-@xmath17 clusters has significantly increased , only long asca observations , with a broad energy response , have allowed a few sketchy studies of their icm properties to date .",
    "a recent compilation of cluster temperatures ( wu , xue and fang , 1999 ) reports a total of 168 clusters with good broad band x - ray spectroscopy , but only 5 ( 3 ) of these have been studied at @xmath2 ( @xmath18 ) .    in this paper",
    "we present _",
    "beppo_sax observations of two high redshift clusters : ms2053.7@xmath00449 from the emss sample at @xmath19 and rxj0152.7@xmath01357 from the rdcs sample at @xmath20 .",
    "the _ beppo_sax mecs instrument ( see section 2 ) has a slightly smaller ( larger ) effective area than the asca gis for @xmath21 kev ( @xmath22 kev ) and it is characterized by a significantly sharper psf if compared with the asca gis or asca sis instruments , especially at high energy .",
    "this latter property implies a reduced background , making _",
    "beppo_sax mecs the best instrument to date for distant clusters investigations .",
    "rxj0152.7@xmath01357 is the highest redshift cluster with good quality broad band x - ray spectroscopy to date and among the most x - ray luminous known at @xmath23 together with the well known ms1054.4@xmath00321 ( gioia and luppino , 1994 ; donahue et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "our data provide a rather accurate ( @xmath24 ) temperature measurement for rxj0152.7@xmath01357 , which allows an interesting comparison with ms1054.4@xmath00321 with very similar redshift and luminosity . in table 1 the main properties of the two clusters , in their own discovery bands , are summarized .

    "the error on the temperature represent the 90% confidence range , while we have used a realistic 15% absolute error for the bolometric luminosity .",
    "since ms2053.7@xmath00449 and axj2019@xmath01127 have very large errors on the measured temperature , we have not reported these objects in figure 7 .    the @xmath9 relationship for clusters at @xmath27 obtained by wu , xue and fang ( 1999 ) ( @xmath28 )",

    "we have assumed the values 1 and 3 , respectively ; these two values have been determined by borgani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and represent the 90% confidence level required to fit the lack of observed evolution of the xlf in the rdcs cluster sample in a @xmath35 = 1 universe .",
    "low density models , instead , can easily be accommodated with a non - evolving @xmath26 relation , or mild ( @xmath36 ) evolution .",
    "the new cluster temperature we have determined for rxj0152.7@xmath01357 is not consistent with a strong evolution of the @xmath26 relation out to @xmath37 .",
    "since all the data points in figure 7 lie to the right of the @xmath38 line , according to the parameterization of borgani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the cluster temperatures measured so far at @xmath2 lend considerable support to cosmological models with a low density parameter .",
    "similar results have been recently obtained by donahue et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and by donahue and voit ( 1999 ) . using a complete sample of high redshift emss clusters , donahue et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , have shown that the cluster temperature function reveals modest evolution , a result which implies a low @xmath10 value ( donahue and voit 1999 ) .",
    "the metal abundance of the icm in rich clusters of galaxies has been recently investigated by mushotzky and loewenstein ( 1997 ) .",
    "they found that the fe abundance shows little or no evolution out to @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , suggesting that most of the enrichment of the icm occurred at @xmath41 .",
    "given the present uncertainty on the icm abundance in rxj0152.7@xmath01357 we can not set strong constraints on the cosmological evolution of the fe abundance .",
    "however , within the large uncertainty ( @xmath42 ; 68 % confidence interval ) , these data suggest that the bulk of the fe enrichment was completed by @xmath43 .",
    "finally it is worth comparing rxj0152.7@xmath01357 with ms1054.4@xmath00321 .",
    "provided that temperature measurements are not biased by cooling flows , strong deviations from isothermality or by the presence of contaminating agn , it is interesting to note that the temperature of ms1054.4@xmath00321 is significantly higher than that of rxj0152.7@xmath01357 , although the two clusters have very similar luminosities . with the present x - ray data we are unable to discuss any further the difference in temperature between these two distant clusters which have nonetheless many similarities .",
    "the highly spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopy and high throughput that _ chandra _ and xmm will provide are needed to clarify this problem as well as to study in detail distant clusters of galaxies .",
    "we have presented and discussed _ beppo_sax observations of two high redshift clusters of galaxies : ms2053.7@xmath00449 at @xmath44 and rxj0152.7@xmath01357 at @xmath45 .",
    "the first object has been selected from the emss sample .",
    "no constraints on the metallicity can be derived from the present data ; by fixing the abundance to 0.3 solar we measure a gas temperature with very high uncertainty ( @xmath7 kev ) .",
    "the second cluster has been selected from the rdcs sample and is one of the most x - ray luminous system known at @xmath23 .",
    "it is characterized by a complex morphology ( both in the optical and soft x - ray ) with at least two cores , a gas temperature of @xmath3 kev and a metallicity of @xmath42 ( 68 % confidence interval ) .",
    "a prominent iron k@xmath5 line is clearly visible in the mecs spectrum .    in light of this new cluster temperature measurement at @xmath46 , we have discussed the high redshift ( @xmath12 ) @xmath9 relationship and we have found that the limited data available so far can easily be accommodated with a non - evolving ( or mildly evolving ) @xmath9 relation .",
    "this result , when combined with the little observed evolution in the x - ray cluster abundance , gives support to cosmological models with a low density parameter ( e.g. borgani et al . , 1999 ) .",
