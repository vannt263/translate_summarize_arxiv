    "an accurate understanding of most astrophysical processes requires necessarily information from nuclear physics , which provides the input to deal with network calculations and astrophysical simulations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "obviously , nuclear physics uncertainties will finally affect the reliability of the description of those astrophysical processes .",
    "this is especially relevant in the case of explosive phenomena , which involve knowledge of the properties of exotic nuclei , not well explored yet .",
    "thus , most of the astrophysical simulations of these violent events must be built on nuclear - model predictions of limited quality and accuracy .",
    "this is in particular the case of the x - ray bursts ( xrbs ) @xcite , which are generated by a thermonuclear runaway in the hydrogen - rich environment of an accreting neutron star that is fed from a red giant binary companion close enough to allow for mass transfer .",
    "type i xrbs are typically characterized by a rapid increase in luminosity generating burst energies of @xmath0 ergs , which are typically a factor 100 larger than the steady luminosity .",
    "the luminosity suffers a sharp raise of about @xmath1 s followed by a gradual softening with time scales between 10 and 100 s. these bursts are recurrent with time scales ranging from hours to days .",
    "the properties of xrbs are particularly dependent on the accretion rate .",
    "typical accretion rates for type i xrbs are about @xmath2 yr@xmath3 . lower accretion rates lead to weaker flashes while larger accretion rates lead to stable burning on the surface of the neutron star .",
    "the ignition of xrbs takes place when the temperature ( @xmath4 ) and the density ( @xmath5 ) in the accreted disk become high enough to allow a breakout from the hot cno cycle .",
    "peak conditions of @xmath6 gk and @xmath7 g @xmath8 are reached and eventually , this scenario allows the development of the nucleosynthesis rapid proton capture ( @xmath9 ) process @xcite , which is characterized by proton capture reaction rates that are orders of magnitude faster than any other competing process , in particular @xmath10-decay .",
    "it produces rapid nucleosynthesis on the proton - rich side of stability toward heavier proton - rich nuclei reaching nuclei with @xmath11 , as it have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the @xmath9 process ends in a closed snsbte cycle .",
    "it also explains the energy and luminosity profiles observed in xrbs .",
    "nuclear reaction network calculations , which may involve as much as several thousand nuclear processes , are performed to follow the time evolution of the isotopic abundances , to determine the amount of energy released by nuclear reactions , and to find the reaction path for the @xmath9 process @xcite . in general",
    ", the reaction path follows a series of fast proton - capture reactions until the dripline is reached and further proton capture is inhibited by a strong reverse photodisintegration reaction . at this point",
    ", the process may only proceed through a beta decay or a less probable double proton capture .",
    "then the reaction flow has to wait for a relatively slow @xmath10-decay and the respective nucleus is called a waiting point ( wp ) .",
    "the short time scale of the @xmath9 process ( around 100 s ) makes highly significant any mechanism that may affect the process in some seconds and the half - lives of the wp nuclei are of this order .",
    "therefore , the half - lives of the wp nuclei along the reaction path determine the time scale of the nucleosynthesis process and the produced isotopic abundances . in this respect ,",
    "the weak decay rates of neutron - deficient medium - mass nuclei under stellar conditions play a relevant role to understand the @xmath9 process .",
    "although the products of the nucleosynthesis @xmath9 process are not expected to be ejected from type i xrbs due to the strength of the neutron star gravitational field , there are other speculative sites for the occurrence of @xmath9 processes .",
    "this is the case of core collapse supernovae that might supply suitable physical conditions for the @xmath9 process provided neutrino - induced reactions are included in the nucleosynthesis calculations @xcite .",
    "these reactions have to be included to bypass the slow beta decays at the wp nuclei via capture reactions of neutrons , which are created from the antielectron neutrino absorption by free protons @xcite .",
    "contrary to the xrbs , these scenarios will finally lead to the ejection of the nucleosynthetic products and thus contribute to the galactic chemical evolution .    since the pioneering work of fuller , fowler and newman @xcite , where the general formalism to calculate weak - interaction rates in stellar environments as a function of density and temperature was introduced , improvements have been focused on the description of the nuclear structure aspect of the problem .",
    "different approaches to describe the nuclear structure involved in the stellar weak decay rates can be found in the literature .",
    "they are basically divided into shell model @xcite or quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) @xcite categories .",
    "certainly , the nuclear structure problem involved in the calculation of these rates must be treated in a reliable way . in particular",
    ", this implies that the nuclear models should be able to describe at least the experimental information available on the decay properties ( gamow - teller strength distributions and @xmath10-decay half - lives ) measured under terrestrial conditions .",
    "although these decay properties may be different at the high @xmath5 and @xmath4 existing in @xmath9 process scenarios , success in describing the decay properties in terrestrial conditions is a requirement for a reliable calculation of the weak decay rates in more general conditions . with this aim in mind",
    ", we study here the dependence of the decay rates on both @xmath5 and @xmath4 using a qrpa approach based on a selfconsistent deformed hartree - fock ( hf ) mean field .",
    "deformation has to be taken into account because the reaction path in the @xmath9 process crosses a region of highly deformed nuclei around @xmath12 .",
    "this nuclear model has been tested successfully ( see @xcite and references therein ) and reproduces very reasonably the experimental information available on both bulk and decay properties of medium - mass nuclei . in this work",
    "we focus our attention to the even - even wp ni , zn , ge , se , kr , sr , zr , mo , ru , pd , cd , and sn isotopes , as well as to their closer even - even neighbors .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ wdr ]",
    "the weak decay rates are introduced as functions of density and temperature and their nuclear structure and phase space components are studied .",
    "section [ results ] contains the results .",
    "first , we study the decay properties under terrestrial conditions , and secondly as functions of both densities and temperatures at the @xmath9 process .",
    "section [ conclusions ] contains the conclusions of this work .",
    "there are several distinctions between terrestrial and stellar decay rates caused by the effect of high @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "the main effect of @xmath4 is directly related to the thermal population of excited states in the decaying nucleus , accompanied by the corresponding depopulation of the ground states .",
    "the weak - decay rates of excited states can be significantly different from those of the ground state and a case by case consideration is needed . another effect related to the high @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath4 comes from the fact that atoms in these scenarios are completely ionized and consequently electrons are no longer bound to the nuclei , but forming a degenerate plasma obeying a fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "this opens the possibility for continuum electron capture ( @xmath13 ) , in contrast to the orbital electron capture ( @xmath14 ) produced by bound electrons in the atom under terrestrial conditions .",
    "these effects make weak interaction rates in the stellar interior sensitive functions of t and @xmath5 , with @xmath15 gk and @xmath16 g @xmath8 , as the most significant conditions for the @xmath9 process @xcite .",
    "the decay rate of the parent nucleus is given by    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the partition function , @xmath19 is the angular momentum ( excitation energy ) of the parent nucleus state @xmath20 , and thermal equilibrium is assumed . in principle , the sum extends over all populated states in the parent nucleus up to the proton separation energy .",
    "however , since the range of temperatures for the @xmath9 process peaks at @xmath15 gk ( @xmath21 kev ) , only a few low - lying excited states are expected to contribute significantly in the decay .",
    "specifically , we consider in this work all the collective low - lying excited states below 1 mev @xcite .",
    "two - quasiparticle excitations in even - even nuclei will appear at an excitation energy above 2 mev , which is a typical energy to break a pair in these isotopes .",
    "hence , they can be safely neglected at these temperatures . as an example",
    ", the maximum population appears for the lowest of these states ( @xmath22 kev in @xmath23sr ) , which at @xmath4=1.5 gk is @xmath24 , while the ground state still contributes with @xmath25 .",
    "the decay rate for the parent state @xmath20 is given by    @xmath26    where the sum extends over all the states in the final nucleus reached in the decay process .",
    "the rate @xmath27 from the initial state @xmath20 to the final state @xmath28 is given by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 s. this expression is decomposed into a nuclear structure part @xmath31 that contains the transition probabilities for allowed fermi ( f ) and gamow - teller ( gt ) transitions ,    @xmath32    and a phase space factor @xmath33 , which is a sensitive function of @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",

    "we have chosen the skyrme force sly4 @xcite as a representative of the skyrme forces .",
    "this particular force includes some selected properties of unstable nuclei in the adjusting procedure of the parameters .",
    "it is one of the most successful skyrme forces and has been extensively studied in the last years .",

    "@xcite , assuming time reversal and axial symmetry .",
    "the single - particle wave functions are expanded in terms of the eigenstates of an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator in cylindrical coordinates , using twelve major shells .",
    "the method also includes pairing between like nucleons in bcs approximation with fixed gap parameters for protons and neutrons , which are determined phenomenologically from the odd - even mass differences involving the experimental binding energies @xcite .",
    "the potential energy curves are analyzed as a function of the quadrupole deformation @xmath10 ,    @xmath34    written in terms of the mass quadrupole moment @xmath35 and the mean square radius @xmath36 .",
    "for that purpose , constrained hf calculations are performed with a quadratic constraint @xcite .",
    "the hf energy is minimized under the constraint of keeping fixed the nuclear deformation .",
    "calculations for gt strengths are performed subsequently for the various equilibrium shapes of each nucleus , that is , for the solutions , in general deformed , for which minima are obtained in the energy curves .",
    "since decays connecting different shapes are disfavored , similar shapes are assumed for the ground state of the parent nucleus and for all populated states in the daughter nucleus .",
    "the validity of this assumption was discussed for example in refs .",

    ", a spin - isospin residual interaction is added to the mean field and treated in a deformed proton - neutron qrpa .",
    "this interaction contains two parts , a particle - hole ( @xmath37 ) and a particle - particle ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the interaction in the @xmath37 channel is responsible for the position and structure of the gt resonance @xcite and it can be derived consistently from the same skyrme interaction used to generate the mean field , through the second derivatives of the energy density functional with respect to the one - body densities . the @xmath37 residual interaction is finally expressed in a separable form by averaging the resulting contact force over the nuclear volume @xcite .",
    "the @xmath38 part is a neutron - proton pairing force in the @xmath39 coupling channel , which is also introduced as a separable force @xcite .",
    "the strength of the @xmath38 residual interaction in this theoretical approach is not derived self - consistently from the sly4 force used to obtain the mean field , but nevertheless it has been fixed in accordance to it .",
    "this strength is usually fitted to reproduce globally the experimental half - lives .",
    "various attempts have been done in the past to fix this strength @xcite , arriving to expressions that depend on the model used to describe the mean field , nilsson model in the above reference . in previous works",

    "one can see that for large enough densities , @xmath13 becomes dominant at any @xmath4 . for low densities , @xmath74 rates dominate at low @xmath4 , while @xmath13 dominates at higher @xmath4 , but in general there is a competition that must be analyzed case by case .    finally , the total rates in ( c ) are a consequence of the competition between @xmath74 and @xmath13 rates mentioned above .",
    "since the @xmath74 decay rate is independent of the density and depends on @xmath4 only through the contributions from excited parent states , the total rates are practically constant for the more exotic isotopes in the upper figures , only modulated by the small contribution from @xmath13 . in the central isotopes the rates are the result of the competition discussed in ( b ) , and finally in the heavier isotopes ( lower figures ) we can see that the total rates are practically due to @xmath13 with little contribution from @xmath74 . tables containing @xmath74 , @xmath13 , and total decay rates for all the isotopes considered in this work are available in ref .",
    "in summary , the weak decay rates of waiting point and neighbor nuclei from ni up to sn have been investigated at temperatures and densities where the @xmath9 process takes place .",
    "the nuclear structure has been described within a microscopic qrpa approach based on a selfconsistent skyrme - hartree - fock - bcs mean field that includes deformation .",
    "this approach reproduces both the experimental half - lives and the more demanding gt strength distributions measured under terrestrial conditions in this mass region .",
    "the relevant ingredients to describe the rates have been analyzed .",
    "we have studied the contributions to the decay rates coming from excited states in the parent nucleus which are populated as @xmath4 raises .",
    "it is found that they start to play a role above @xmath147 gk and that for isotopes with low - lying excited states , their contributions can be comparable to those of the ground states . concerning the contributions from the continuum electron capture rates , it is found that they are enhanced with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "they are already comparable to the @xmath74 decay rates at @xmath9 conditions for the wp nuclei . for more exotic isotopes",
    "the rates are dominated by @xmath74 decay , while for more stable isotopes they are dominated by @xmath13 .",
