    "relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics has established itself as an effective theory for investigations of phenomena in relativistic heavy - ion collisions owing to its success in describing the elliptic flow @xmath0 data measured at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) @xcite .",
    "most hydrodynamic approaches @xcite do assume an instantaneous chemical equilibrium of matter constituents",
    ". however , this requires an infinite large transition rate of microscopic processes which drive the system towards the chemical equilibrium and thus breaks the consistency of the physical description for matter with a finite viscosity .",
    "another extreme but physically consistent case , as considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , is to keep the number of the constituents constant by assuming that there are no particle number changing processes . in this case deviation of the one - particle phase space distribution from its chemical equilibrium form",
    "becomes larger and larger when the system expands . in real ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions",
    "bremsstrahlung processes of gluons and quarks , also gluon fusion to quark and antiquark , and the reverse processes govern the chemical equilibration of gluons and quarks @xcite .",
    "therefore , particle number changing processes with realistic rates should be included in underlying hydrodynamic descriptions for quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .    because the energy density @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the fugacity and @xmath3 the temperature , for keeping the energy density unchanged the temperature decreases by @xmath4 when the fugacity increases from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "thus , an effect of chemical equilibration is expected to be present for the temperature , which is an important detail , for instance for the dilepton @xcite and photon @xcite yields in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . moreover , to what degree chemical equilibration of quarks and gluons is achieved at the phase transition might also be crucial for modelling hadronization using recombination models @xcite .    in this work",
    "we develop a dissipative hydrodynamic approach including particle number changing processes via a rate equation to investigate the bulk properties of the qgp at rhic . as a first step we simplify the expansion dynamics at rhic by assuming a one - dimensional expansion in the beam axis with bjorken boost invariance .",
    "the qgp is considered to possess a constant @xmath7 value during its evolution .",
    "different from the previous studies of chemical equilibration of the qgp basing on either ideal @xcite or first - order @xcite hydrodynamic equations , we apply the second - order israel - stewart @xcite as well as the extended third - order hydrodynamic equations @xcite to describe the qgp evolution .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are now coupled with a rate equation for the particle number density .",
    "the microscopic interactions , which are responsible for the viscous behaviour and change of the particle number , are simplified by elastic binary @xmath8 and inelastic multiplication and annihilation @xmath9 processes with isotropically distributed collision angles .",
    "although the evolution of multi - component systems as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite is gaining an increasing attention , here we consider only a pure gluon system for the sake of simplicity .    to examine the applicability of the new description we compare the hydrodynamic solutions with those calculated from a parton cascade , the boltzmann approach of multiparton scatterings ( bamps ) @xcite , in a similar manner as done in refs .",

    "<S> we find that not only the particle production , but also the temperature and the momentum spectra of the gluon system , obtained from the hydrodynamic calculations , are sensitive to the rates of particle number changing processes . comparisons of the hydrodynamic calculations with the transport ones employing the parton cascade bamps show the inaccuracy of the rate equation at large shear viscosity to entropy density ratio . </S>",
    "<S> to improve the rate equation , the grad s ansatz has to be modified beyond the second moments in momentum . </S>"
