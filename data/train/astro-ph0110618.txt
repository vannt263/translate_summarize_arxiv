    "in the standard paradigm , the formation of cosmological structures is driven by gravitational amplification of tiny initial density fluctuations ( e.g. peebles 1980 ) .",
    "in addition to gravity , hydrodynamical processes can greatly influence the formation and evolution of galaxies , groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "hydrodynamical effects , however , play a minor role in shaping the observed distribution of galaxies on scales a few times larger than the size of galaxy clusters .",
    "therefore , gravitational instability theory directly relates the present - day large scale structure to the initial density field and provides the frame - work within which the observations are analyzed and interpreted .",
    "gravitational instability is a non - linear process .",
    "analytic solutions exist only for configurations with special symmetry , and approximate tools are limited to moderate density contrasts .",
    "so , numerical methods are necessary for a full understanding of the observed large scale structure of the universe .",
    "there are two complementary numerical approaches .",
    "the first approach relies on @xmath0-body techniques designed to solve an initial value problem in which the evolution of a self - gravitating system of massive particles is determined by numerical integration of the newtonian differential equations .",
    "combined with semi - analytic models of galaxy formation , @xmath0-body simulations have become an essential tool for comparing the predictions of cosmological models with the observed properties of galaxies .",
    "because the exact initial conditions are unknown , comparisons between simulations and observations are mainly concerned with general statistical properties .",
    "the second approach aims at finding the past orbits of mass tracers ( galaxies ) from their observed present - day distribution , independent as much as possible of the nature of the dark matter .",
    "the orbits must be such that the initial spatial distribution is homogeneous .",
    "this approach can be very useful for direct comparisons between different types of observations of the large scale structure .",
    "most common are the velocity - velocity ( hereafter _ v - v _ ) comparisons between the observed peculiar velocities of galaxies are and the velocity field inferred from the galaxy distribution in redshift surveys ( davis , nusser & willick 1996 , willick 1997 , willick & strauss 1998 , nusser 2000 , branchini 2001 ) alternatively , one can also perform a density - density comparison between the mass density field inferred from the peculiar velocities of galaxies via potent - like methods ( bertschinger & dekel 1989 ) or wiener filtering techniques ( zaroubi 1995 ) and the observed galaxy distribution ( see sigad 1998 and references therein ) . both types of analysis yield the cosmological mass density parameter @xmath7 , for an assumed biasing relation between the distribution of galaxies and the mass density field .",
    "any systematic mismatch between the fields serves as an indication to the nature of galaxy formation and/or the origin of galaxy intrinsic scaling relations used to measure the distances , provided that errors in the calibration have been properly corrected for .",
    "this second approach also allows to perform back - in - time reconstructions of the density field on scales @xmath8 both in real ( e.g , nusser & dekel 1992 , gramman 1993 , croft & gaztaaga 1998 , frisch 2001 ) and redshift space ( narayanan & weinberg 1998 , monaco & efstathiou 1999 ) .",
    "some of these methods has been applied to recover the past orbits from all - sky galaxy redshift surveys ( monaco 2000 , narayanan 2001 ) .",
    "finding the orbits that satisfy initial homogeneity and match the present - day distribution of mass tracers is a boundary value problem .",
    "this problem naturally lends itself to an application of hamilton s variational principle where the orbits of the objects are found by searching for stationary variations of the action subject to the boundary conditions .",
    "the use of the principle of least action in a cosmological frame - work has been pioneered by peebles ( 1989 ) and has long been restricted to small systems such as the local group ( peebles 1990 , peebles 1994 , schmoldt & saha 1998 , sharpe 2001 ) and the local supercluster ( shaya , peebles & tully 1995 ) .",
    "early applications to large galaxy redshift surveys have been hampered by the computational cost of handling the relatively large number of objects .",
    "subsequent numerical applications speeded up the method and allowed the reconstruction of the orbits of @xmath9 particles ( shaya , peebles & tully 1995 ) .",
    "however , it was only recently that the improvement of the minimization techniques and the use of efficient gravity solvers made it possible to deal with more than @xmath10 objects ( e.g. the fast action method [ hereafter fam ] by nusser & branchini 2000 and the perturbative least action method by goldberg & spergel 2000 ) , comparable to the number of objects contained in the largest all - sky galaxy redshift catalogs presently available such as the optical redshift survey ( santiago 1995 , 1996 ) and iras psc@xmath5 ( hereafter psc@xmath5 , saunders 1996 , saunders 2000 )",
    ". the situation has also been improved thanks to the invention of self - consistent direct schemes for accounting for redshift distortions , arising from the systematic differences between the distribution of galaxies in real and redshift space ( e.g. kaiser 1987 ) .",
    "previous applications ( e.g. , shaya , peebles & tully 1995 ) relied on iterations .",
    "however , self - consistent treatments of the problem have been proposed by schmoldt & saha ( 1998 ) , nusser & branchini ( 2000 ) , phleps ( 2000 ) , susperregi ( 2001 ) and goldberg ( 2001 ) .    in this work",
    "we will implement and test one of the numerical action methods on realistic large mock redshift catalogs to reconstruct galaxy orbits over a large region of the universe .",
    "more precisely we will extend the fast action method of nusser & branchini ( 2000 , hereafter nb ) to redshift space and focus on the problem of predicting galaxy peculiar velocities from a flux - limited , all - sky redshift catalog resembling the psc@xmath5 one .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] we review fam in real and redshift space the performance of fam is evaluated in the case of the ideal spherical infall in section  [ sec : sphere ]",
    ". then a suite of more demanding tests is performed using the mock catalogs of galaxies described in section  [ sec : mock ] .",
    "fam is then applied to ideal , volume - limited mock catalogs in section  [ sec : nbodyvol ] and to flux - limited mock catalogs in section  [ sec : nbodyflux ] .",
    "particular emphasis is given to the ability of fam in returning an unbiased estimate of galaxy velocities and their correlation properties .",
    "the main conclusions are discussed and summarized in section [ sec : disconc ] .",
    "we will use the terms famz and famr to refer to implementations of fam in redshift and real distance space , respectively .",
    "statements referring to fam are meant to apply to both famz and famr . for brevity",
    "we will use x - space and s - space to refer to real - space and redshift - space , respectively .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize the fast action method . for a detailed description of the method we refer the reader to sections 2 and 4.2 of nb .",
    "we follow the standard notation in which @xmath11 is the scale factor , @xmath12 is the hubble function , @xmath13 is the ratio of the background matter density of the universe , @xmath14 , to the critical density , @xmath15 .",
    "we denote the comoving coordinate of a patch of matter by @xmath16 , and the corresponding comoving velocity by @xmath17 .",
    "also , let @xmath18 be the linear density growing mode normalized to unity at the present epoch , and @xmath19 ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ) .",
    "in the following we will use @xmath18 as the time variable in the equations of motion , with @xmath20 as the corresponding velocity .",
    "expressed in term of the time variable @xmath21 , the equations of motion are almost independent on @xmath7 and the cosmological constant ( gramann 1993 , mancinelli & yahil 1995 , nusser & colberg 1998 ) .",

    "famr expands the orbits in a time dependent base functions @xmath34 in the form , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the position of the particle @xmath37 at the present epoch , and the vectors @xmath38 are the expansion coefficients with respect to which the action is varied , i.e. , they satisfy @xmath39",
    ". the base functions @xmath40 and their derivatives @xmath41 are linear combinations of @xmath42 so that the particle positions at @xmath43 is fixed , and @xmath44 ensures initial homogeneity . to simplify the expression of the gradient of the action , @xmath45 , nb imposed following the orthonormality condition on the functions @xmath46 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the kronecker delta function .",
    "the expansion of the orbits given in ( [ eq : expand ] ) has to be modified when the constraints are galaxy redshifts , rather than the true distances .",

    "similar transformations of this type have been proposed by schmoldt & saha ( 1998 ) and withing ( 2001 ) .",
    "our strategy is to find orbits that are as close as possible to the hubble flow .",
    "therefore , we search for the minimum of the action and do not look for stationary points which might describe oscillatory behavior of the orbits ( peebles 1990 , 1994 ) .",
    "to find the coefficients @xmath38 that minimize the action , fam uses the conjugate gradient method ( cgm ) which is fast and easy to implement ( press 1992 ) . the gravitational force @xmath25 and its potential",
    "are computed using the treecode gravity solver ( bouchet & hernquist 1988 ) .",
    "the time integration in the expression for the action is done using the gaussian quadrature method with 10 points at the time abscissa ( press 1992 ) .",
    "the cgm requires an initial guess for @xmath66 . in the standard fam application",
    "we compute the initial guess using the linear theory relation between the velocity and mass distribution .",
    "the minimum of the action proved to be rather insensitive to the choice of initial guess for @xmath66 , as we have checked by running fam experiments with initial @xmath38 both set to zero and to random numbers with appropriate variance .",
    "besides the initial set of @xmath67 , the other free parameters are the softening used by the gravity solver and the tolerance parameter that sets the convergence of the cgm method .",
    "the collapse of a spherical over - dense perturbation can be followed analytically into the nonlinear regime before the occurrence of shell crossing ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ) .",
    "testing fam with the spherical collapse model will allow an assessment of the `` shot - noise '' errors in the recovered velocities .",
    "these errors arise from the discrete sampling of the density field and can be quantified by applying fam in two different ways . in the first , we treat each particle as a uniform spherical shell . so the gravitational field on a particle is radial and only due to particles lying within its radius . in this way particles move along radial orbits and",
    "shot - noise errors are minimized . in the second ,",
    "each particle is treated as point mass and the gravitational field is computed from the treecode as in any other application of fam .",

    "we assume a flat universe with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the analytic solution returns the density and peculiar velocity fields at a generic time .",
    "the evolved density field is then randomly sampled with 20,000 particles within @xmath74 mpc .",
    "each particle is then assigned a peculiar velocity according to the analytic solution and its redshift coordinate is computed accordingly .",
    "the distribution of these particles in x - space and s - space are then fed into famr and famz , respectively .",
    "we have used @xmath75 base functions to expand the orbit of each particle , a softening of @xmath76 mpc , and a tolerance parameter @xmath77 to determine the convergence of the cgm solution .    in the first fam experiments , particles move in radial orbits under the action of the radial gravity force .",

    "[ fig : sph1 ] . in both panels ,",
    "the velocity profile in the analytic solution is represented by the continuous solid line .",

    "the filled squares represent the final overdensity profile , @xmath78 , also in radial bins of 5 mpc .",
    "both famr and famz match the analytic solution very well at all radii .",
    "we have repeated the famz and famr experiments with the gravity force field computed by summing over the 3-dimensional discrete distribution of the point masses .",
    "this generates random shot - noise errors in the fam recovered velocities .",
    "the radial velocity profiles are shown in the two bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : sph1 ] . the results of the famr and famz experiments are very similar .",
    "the average fam solutions ( filled dots ) are still close to the true one .",
    "fam appears to underestimate the true velocities in the high density regions .",
    "however , the effect is of little significance ( @xmath79 ) when compared to the 1-d scatter around the mean ( @xmath80 ) which , instead , does not seem to depend on the local density .",
    "the amplitude of the random errors is better appreciated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sph2 ] , where we plot the cartesian x - component of true _ vs. _ fam velocities of @xmath81 randomly selected particles .",
    "the parameters of the best linear fit and its 1-d , @xmath1 scatter are shown in each panel .",
    "the diagonal line in each panel is plotted to guide the eye .",
    "the two upper panels show the results when the particles are forced to move along radial orbits . when this constraint is removed ( lower panels ) , the shot noise error causes a @xmath82 uncertainty in fam reconstructions which is clearly visible both in x- ( bottom - left ) and s - space ( bottom - right ) .",
    "the small systematic errors seen in fig .  [ fig : sph1 ] are also visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : sph2 ] and cause the fam velocities to be slightly underestimated , especially when the reconstruction is performed in x - space .",
    "systematic errors can be quantified by the deviation of the slope of the best fitting line from unity .",
    "the main source for the systematic mismatch is the softening used in the treecode to compute the force field .",
    "as already pointed out by nb , the amplitude of fam velocities decreases when increasing the softening parameter , along with the scatter around the best fitting line .",
    "this is true also in the spherical infall experiment , as we have checked by running the same famr with a smaller softening parameter of @xmath83 mpc .",
    "as expected , using a smaller softening reduces systematic errors and increases the slope of the best fitting line from @xmath84 to @xmath85 .",
    "we have also tested famz with spherical infall in a universe with @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "famz velocities are still free of systematic biases and the relative random errors are similar to those found in the previous tests in a flat , @xmath72 universe .",
    "in sections  [ sec : nbodyvol ] and [ sec : nbodyflux ] we will perform more realistic and demanding tests of fam using a suite of mock catalogs extracted from two @xmath0-body simulations performed by cole ( 1998 ) .",
    "the initial conditions of the two simulations were generated , respectively , from two cosmological models of cold dark matter : a flat @xmath88cdm model with @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and a flat @xmath89cdm universe with @xmath90 and power spectrum shape parameter @xmath91 .",
    "both simulations were ran with an ap@xmath92 m code loaded with @xmath93 particles in a box of side @xmath94 . in both simulations",
    "the initial amplitude of the density fluctuations was normalized to the observed abundance of galaxy clusters .",
    "this requires setting @xmath95 ( eke , cole & frenk 1996 ) , where @xmath96 is the linear rms mass density fluctuation in top - hat spheres of radius @xmath97 ( which hereafter we indicate with th8 ) . before generating the mock catalogs the distribution of @xmath0-body particles has been re - sampled by assigning a constant probability to each particle which is used to perform a montecarlo rejection procedure from a poisson distribution with mean equal to the required probability .",
    "the original@xmath0-body particles particles are thus substituted by 0,1,2 or on rare occasions an even higher number of particles that retain positions and velocities of the parent object .",
    "particles at the same locations are usually collapsed into a single objects with higher mass .",
    "occasionally , however , roundoff errors cause them to be retained as close pairs or triplets of particles .",
    "furthermore , we have cooled down the particles peculiar velocities since they are significantly larger than those of real galaxies .",
    "the new peculiar velocities @xmath98 are obtained in two steps ( davis , nusser & willick 1996 ) .",
    "first we perform a mass - weighted smoothing of the n - body velocities , @xmath99 , with a spherical top hat filter of radius @xmath100 and obtain a smoothed velocity field @xmath101 then the two vector fields are added linearly to give @xmath102 .",
    "the new pairwise velocity dispersion measured for object with a relative separation of @xmath103 is @xmath104 , comparable to the value measured by strauss , ostriker & cen ( 1998 ) for galaxies outside high density region in the optical redshift survey .    from these two simulations",
    "we have extracted 4 sets of mock catalogs .",
    "each catalog lists particle positions , redshifts , and peculiar velocities in a spherical region of radius of @xmath105 centered on a local - group look - alike particle ( see branchini 1999 for details ) .",
    "each set contains 5 + 5 independent mock catalogs , corresponding to the two simulations , so that in total we have 40 catalogs .",
    "the four sets are termed vl , vl5th , fl , and fl5th and their main properties are summarized in table  [ tab : mock ] .",
    "the sets vl and vl5th are volume - limited catalogs , while fl and fl5th are flux - limited .",
    "a catalog in the vl set is generated by randomly extracting 20,000 particles in a sphere of radius @xmath105 , half of which sample the inner sphere of radius @xmath106 and the rest are contained in the shell between @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "different masses have been assigned to internal and external particles to guarantee the same average mass density throughout the volume . a typical vl mock catalog is displayed in the top - left panel of fig .  [ fig : maps ] which shows a slice of thickness @xmath109 cut through a vl mock catalog extracted from the @xmath89cdm simulation .",
    "to obtain the vl5th catalogs we first smooth in x - space the particles distribution in the @xmath0-body simulation in a mass - weighted fashion with a spherical top - hat filter of radius @xmath3 and then we poisson sample the smoothed density field with 20,000 particles , half of which inside @xmath106 . the bottom - left panel of fig .",

    "these results demonstrate that , unlike the two other method considered here , applying famz to a psc@xmath5-like redshift catalog allow to predict a model for the cosmic velocity field which is unbiased , provided that famz velocities are smoothed on a scale of @xmath8 .",

    ", we showed that fam can successfully recover peculiar velocities from the particle distribution in x- and s - space .",
    "errors in the predicted velocities are mainly due to shot noise and highly nonlinear motions that fam fails to model correctly . shot noise errors depend on the sparseness of galaxy sampling and",
    "thus on the particular dataset considered . to obtain a realistic error estimate we set the number density of galaxies in our mock catalogs similar to that in the inner part of the real psc@xmath5 , 2df and sdss catalogs .",
    "errors due to nonlinear motions can be reduced by avoiding high density regions .",
    "indeed , discarding objects in the highest density peaks brings systematic errors down to a level smaller than @xmath134 and reduces the amplitude of random uncertainties from @xmath135 to @xmath4 in the volume limited experiments .",
    "when applied to flux - limited mock catalogs mimicking the distribution of galaxies in the psc@xmath5 redshift survey , fam systematic errors outside dense regions are still below 20 % and the 1-d random velocity errors amount to @xmath136 .",

    "improves the results of the fit and returns velocity estimates which are almost unbiased . another strategy to reduce the impact of nonlinear motions",
    "is that of smoothing the model velocity field .",
    "we have found that famz velocities smoothed with a top hat filter of radius @xmath138 are free of systematic biases .",
    "clearly , there is nothing fundamental in this smoothing scale . to the contrary",
    ", the amount of smoothing required to minimize systematic errors depends on the strength of nonlinear motions , sampling rate and on the particular method used to compare model and observations .",
    "other reconstruction methods like those based on linear theory and zeldovich approximation could also predict unbiased velocities , provided that an appropriate smoothing filter is applied .",
    "however , the smoothing scale required by famz to eliminate systematic errors is smaller than that required by linear theory or piza and thus allow to retain more information which lead to a more precise estimates of cosmological parameters such as @xmath139 .    since fam errors depend on several external factors , like the particular dataset considered , it is difficult to compare our results with those of other analyses .",
    "for example , it is somewhat surprising that errors in the cartesian components of famz velocities predicted from our mock psc@xmath5 catalogs are a factor of two larger than those of the velocities obtained by applying the the iterative , quasi - linear model of sigad ( 1998 ) to the iras 1.2 jy .",

    "indeed , the better treatment of nonlinear dynamics by famz and the denser sampling of the psc@xmath5 catalog should reduce these uncertainties rather than increase them . as discussed by branchini ( 2001 )",
    ", this apparent inconsistency derives from the differences in the mock catalogs used to calibrate the two reconstruction methods .",
    "peculiar velocities in our mock catalogs , extracted from the ap@xmath92 m simulations of cole ( 1998 ) , are more nonlinear than those of the mock catalogs used willick ( 1997 ) that were extracted from pm @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the higher``temperature '' of the velocity field in our mocks increases the uncertainties in the velocity reconstruction procedure .",
    "errors in velocity predictions are further amplified by the spurious pairs and triplets of nearby particles contained in our mocks .",
    "the net result is that our estimated famz velocity errors are larger that those of willick ( 1997 ) .",
    "another example is given by the large systematic errors affecting our linear velocity predictions compared to fam velocities , as shown by figures  [ fig : vv_famz_l_p_f ] and  [ fig : vv_famz_l_p_v ] .",
    "this result suggests that estimates of @xmath140 from @xmath141 comparisons that use a linear model velocity field based on the psc@xmath5 catalog ( e.g. nusser ( 2000 ) and branchini ( 2001 ) ) are biased low and that this bias could be reduced by using the famz model , instead . a quantitative assessment of this bias and its reduction",
    ", however , needs to account for the differences between the various models and analyses .",
    "first of all the linear model used by nusser ( 2000 ) and branchini ( 2001 ) was corrected for redshift s - space distortions while our model is not .",
    "second , in this work the @xmath141 comparisons are performed through simple linear regressions while the velmod analysis of branchini ( 2001 ) and the mode - by - mode comparison of nusser ( 2000 ) are less trivial and require additional manipulation of the data that may affect the estimate of @xmath140 . while we plan to quantify these effects in a future paper we also point out that the tests performed by branchini ( 2001 ) and nusser ( 2000 ) have indicated that possible systematic errors on @xmath140 are below the 20 % level .",
    "the two previous examples illustrate that the results presented in this work are only valid for volume limited and flux limited samples that mimic the psc@xmath5 catalog . as for any reconstruction method ,",
    "random and systematic errors need to be estimated again when a new dataset is considered or a new model vs. data analysis is implemented .",
    "such error analysis is best done by applying fam to a set of realistic mock catalogs , as we did in this work    the dependence of the clustering properties on the type of real galaxies implies that most galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying mass fluctuations ( loveday 1995 , baker 1998 , hawkins 2001 , norberg 2001 ) .",
    "nb have shown that a local biasing scheme can be easily incorporated in fam by assigning to each particle a mass proportional to @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are , respectively , the mass and galaxy density contrast in the vicinity of the particle .",
    "alternatively , given @xmath145 one can obtain the mass density field from the galaxy distribution .",
    "the mass density field can then be sampled by a discrete particle distribution to be used as input in fam , instead of the original biased particle distribution .",
    "any biasing relation is naturally defined in real space ; hence an application of fam on a distribution of galaxies in s - space must be done iteratively , if biasing is to be incorporated properly . nevertheless , several authors have shown that forcing a biasing relation in s - space does not introduce large errors ( e.g. verde 1998 , scoccimarro 2001 , szapudi 1998 , sigad , branchini & dekel 2000 , narayanan 2001 ) . by making reasonable assumptions on the statistical properties of the mass density , it is even possible to derive the biasing relation in redshift space directly from the redshift catalog .",
    "for example , a biasing scheme can be obtained by mapping the probability distribution function ( pdf ) obtained from the galaxy distribution into a mass pdf which is assumed to be log - normal ( sigad , branchini & dekel 2000 ) or by extensively applying hybrid reconstruction techniques ( e.g. narayanan 2001 ) . in future work , we will test fam using different biasing schemes and also using mock galaxy catalogs extracted from `` galaxies '' identified in @xmath0-body simulations using semi - analytic models ( e.g. , kauffmann , nusser & steinmetz 1997 , kauffmann 1999 , benson 2000 ) .",
    "methods based on the least action principle , like fam , can serve as a time machine for recovering the particle positions and velocities at any early epoch .",
    "the particle distribution can then be filtered to obtain the density field as a function of time .",
    "a backward reconstruction of the large scale structure can be very rewarding .",
    "it can provide an estimate for the initial density field and this could discriminate among different cosmological scenarios , e.g. by detecting non - gaussian features in the primordial density field or by measuring its power spectrum ( nusser , dekel , & yahil 1995 , kolatt 1996 , monaco 2000 , narayanan 2001 ) .",
    "the performance of fam as a time machine has only been tested on the scale of the local group in real space with no biasing ( peebles 1990 , 1994 ) , or with a simple halo biasing prescription ( dunn & laflamme 1993 , branchini & carlberg 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , there is a need for thorough testing of fam to establish its reliability at recovering the past orbits in redshift space , over scales of cosmological interests and using realistic , time - dependent biasing schemes ( nusser & davis 1994 , fry 1996 , matarrese 1997 ) .",
    "while we plan to address these issues in a future paper it is important to note that our results , along with those obtained by nb , show that famz performs better than linear theory and piza ( croft & gaztaaga 1998 ) in reconstructing peculiar velocities at the present epoch .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that the famz will also improve over piza backward reconstruction and thus will be able to recover the correct initial conditions down to scales smaller than @xmath131 , without enforcing any _ prior _ power spectrum like in the perturbative least action procedure ( goldberg & spergel 2000 ) .",
    "the results of our tests indicate that , once applied to the psc@xmath5 catalog , famz will able to model the cosmic velocity field down to scales of a few megaparsecs with 1-d random uncertainty of @xmath146 , hence improving over presently available models also obtained from the psc@xmath5 catalog using either linear theory ( branchini 1999 ) or the piza method ( valentine , saunders & taylor 2000 ) .",
    "we plan to use this new velocity model to perform @xmath141 comparisons that should return an estimate of @xmath147 , with an expected @xmath1 uncertainty of @xmath148 and , because of the wide range of scales probed by the recent data , to provide valuable information on the scale dependence of the biasing relation .    in this paper ,",
    "fam has been applied to systems containing up to @xmath149 particles .",
    "since the computational cost of fam reconstructions scales as @xmath150 , the method can also be applied to new generation redshift surveys containing @xmath151 to @xmath152 objects , like the 2df and sdss catalogs . in these new catalogs , however ,",
    "the surveyed regions span only a fraction of the celestial sphere .",
    "this constitutes a potential problem for reconstruction methods like fam which require to be applied to spherical catalogs to minimize the dynamical influence of the neglected mass distributed outside the volume of the sample .",
    "a possible way to proceed is to reconstruct the velocity field over a series of spherical sub - catalogs carved out of the parent survey .",
    "the sampling within these sub - catalogs will be denser than in the psc@xmath5 catalog and the velocity model less affected by shot noise . as a result ,",
    "applying the famz procedure to a set of spherical sub - samples filling the volume of the parent catalog would return an unbiased model velocity fields on unprecedented large scales and with 1-d random uncertainties of about @xmath153 .",
    "this would lead to a precise determination of the distribution of mass which could then be cross - correlated with absorption features in agn spectra either due to the interviewing cold , neutral hydrogen ( ly@xmath154 line ) or to the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( o@xmath155 and o@xmath156 lines ) to determine the ill - known baryon fraction at z=0 . another possibility would be to compare fam velocity prediction with precise velocity measurements of galaxies in the very local universe , like those obtained from the surface brightness fluctuation method ( tonry 2000 , 2001 ) . this should allow to measure the value of @xmath147 with an even higher precision .",
