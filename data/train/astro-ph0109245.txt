    "the topic of this paper concerns the chemistry of planet - harboring solar - type stars , which have recently been ( and are now being ) discovered one after another mostly by the doppler technique thanks to the energetic activities of several groups .",
    "it seems to have been almost established observationally that those stars bearing giant planets tend to be mildly metal - rich ( i.e. , @xmath2 + 0.2 dex on the average with a considerable scatter ) compared to the sun or similar standard stars , though there are some exceptions ( see , e.g. , gonzalez et al .",
    "2001 ; sadakane et al .",
    "2001 , santos et al . 2001 ; smith et al . 2001 ; and references therein ) .",
    "what is now in hot debate is , however , the _ cause _ of this tendency  why does the existence of planets have something to do with the photospheric abundances of host stars ?    here , a promising and often invoked interpretation is the `` self - enrichment '' hypothesis .",
    "this attributes the origin of the overabundance of metals to the accretion of large amount of h - depleted ( i.e. , relatively metal - rich ) rocky planetesimal materials onto the star , which is more or less reasonably understood from the viewpoint of the planet - formation process .",
    "following this line , theoretical as well as observational investigations have recently been done to clarify whether this mechanism accounts for the observed abundance characteristics also in the quantitative sense .",
    "murray and chaboyer ( 2001 ) arrived at a kind of affirmative conclusion that adding @xmath26.5 @xmath3 of iron to each star can explain both the mass  metallicity and the age ",
    "metallicity relations of the stars with planets .",
    "contrary to this , however , pinsonneault et al .",
    "( 2001 ) pointed out that an evident @xmath4-dependence ( i.e. , more enhanced metallicity in earlier - type stars ) must be observed if such an accretion mechanism is really responsible , which is not observed .",
    "similarly , santos et al . ( 2001 ) concluded by examining the shape of the metallicity distribution that the `` pollution scenario '' due to accretion is unlikely .",
    "they attributed the higher metallicity of planet - harboring stars to the simple fact that higher gas metallicity leads to the high probability of planet formation .",
    "meanwhile , another important key to check the `` self - enrichment '' hypothesis is to study the abundance pattern of various elements , especially the difference between the volatile elements ( such as c , n , o ) with low condensation temperature @xmath0 ( i.e. , rather unlikely to be comprised in rocky materials ) and the refractory elements ( such as the iron - group elements ) with high @xmath0 ( being apt to be condensed into solid particles ) .",
    "namely , since the elements of the former group are expected to be deficient in the accreted materials relative to the latter , the abundances of the volatile group would not show such an overabundance as exhibited by the refractory group ( e.g. , fe ) .    then , is such a trend really observed ?",
    "sadakane et al.s ( 1999 ) result for hd 217107 , that c and o do not appear to share the tendency of marked overabundance shown by the other elements , may be suggestive for this prediction .",
    "also , gonzales and laws ( 2000 ) once stated that planet - harboring stars with [ fe / h]@xmath5 tend to be [ c / fe]@xmath6 , again suggesting that c does not keep pace with the enrichment of fe ( though other stars without planets appear to show the similar tendency ; see also santos et al .",
    "later , however , gonzalez et al . (",
    "2001 ) withdrawed this claim by stating `` that stars with planets have low [ c / fe ] is found to be spurious , due to unrecognized systematic differences among published studies '' .",
    "on the other hand , smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found that a small subset of planet - harboring stars ( i.e. , those with large planets orbiting quite close ) exhibit a trend of increasing [ x / h ] with an increase in @xmath0 , which is a sign of the accretion of chemically fractionated solid material .",
    "thus , the situation is rather confusing , and a new systematic observational study is required to settle this problem . following this motivation",
    ", we decided to investigate , based on our own observational data of bright planet - bearing stars collected at okayama astrophysical observatory , whether any difference or systematic tendency exists between the abundances of volatile and refractory elements , which can be an important touchstone for the adequacy of the `` self - pollution '' scenario .",
    "this is the purpose of the present study , in which we will focus on the abundances of five volatile elements ( c , n , o , s , and zn ) and compare them with those of the refractory elements ( si , ti , v , fe , co , and ni )",
    "we observed 18 stars ( 14 planet - harboring stars and 4 reference stars ) listed in table 1 by using the new high dispersion echelle specstrograph ( hides ; cf .",
    "izumiura 1999 ) at the coud focus of the 188  cm reflector of okayama astrophysical observatory in 2000 april , 2000 october , 2000 december , 2001 february , and 2001 march .",
    "the slit width was set to 200  @xmath7 m ( @xmath8 ) , by which the spectral resolution of @xmath9 was accomplished . by using the single 4k@xmath102k ccd ( 13.5  @xmath7 m pixel )",
    ", the wavelength span of @xmath11 could be covered at one time .",
    "we have chosen three wavelength regions : green - centered region ( 49006100 @xmath12 ; g ) , red - centered region ( 59007100 @xmath12 ; r ) , and ( near-)ir - centered region ( 76008800 @xmath12 ; i ) .",
    "all stars could be observed at both of the wavelength regions g and r , while the region i data could not be obtained for six stars ( @xmath13 eri , 51 peg , hd 217107 , 14 her , @xmath14 cet , and @xmath15 vir ) .",
    "the reduction of echelle data ( bias subtraction , flat - fielding , scattered - light subtraction , spectrum extraction , and wavelength calibration ) was performed by using the iraf software package in a standard manner .",
    "the s / n ratios of the resulting spectra differ from case to case , but are typically of the order of 200300 .",
    "however , the near - ir spectra turned out to be generally of poorer quality because interference fringes could not completely be removed",
    ".    regarding the solar spectrum used as a reference standard , we adopted the very high resolution and very high s / n solar flux spectrum published by kurucz et al .",
    "with regard to the atmospheric parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath16 , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath17 ) of the program stars necessary for constructing model atmospheres and determining abundances , various published studies were consulted .",
    "we compared the published values from several sources ( e.g. , gonzalez 1998 ; gonzalez et al .",
    "2001 ; gonzalez , law 2001 ; fuhrmann 1998 ) for a same star when available , and found that they are generally consistent with each other and that the differences are in most cases within @xmath18100  k and @xmath190.1 . the adopted parameter values ( with the references )",
    "are presented in table 1 .",
    "we interpolated kurucz s ( 1993 ) grid of atlas9 model atmospheres in terms of @xmath4 , @xmath16 , and [ fe / h ] to generate the atmospheric model for each star .",
    "regarding the target volatile elements ( c , n , o , s , and zn ) , as far as the lines of interest are neither blended nor too weak , we determined the abundances from the equivalent widths by using the width9 program , a companion program to the atlas9 model atmosphere program written by dr .",
    "r. l. kurucz ( kurucz 1993 ) . as for the data of spectral lines ( wavelengths , @xmath20 values , and damping parameters )",
    ", we exclusively invoked the compilation of kurucz and bell ( 1995 ) .",
    "the @xmath20 values of important lines relevant to our analyses are presented in table 2 , though the choice of absolute oscillator strengths is not essential because the analysis of this study is differential relative to the sun .",
    "the observed equivalent widths ( which were measured by the method of gaussian fitting or direct integration depending on cases ) and the resulting abundances are given in tables 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "note that the s abundance from the s  i 6052 line was determined by correctly taking into account the blending two components , while the equivalent width was measured as if regarding it as a single line .",
    "also , the non - lte correction ( amounting to @xmath20.10.4 dex ) was taken into consideration for deriving the o abundance from the strong o  i 7771 , 7774 , and 7775 triplet lines according to the calculation of takeda ( 2001 ) , as given in the 7th column of table 4 .",
    "meanwhile , refractory element abundances ( si , ti , v , fe , co , and ni ) were determined by the spectrum synthetic technique while applying the automatic fitting algorithm ( takeda 1995 ) , in which the abundances of these 6 elements ( along with the macrobroadening parameter and the radial velocity shift ) were simultaneously varied to find the best - fit solution such that minimizing the @xmath21 deviation .",
    "this yields accurate and reliable results than the case of conventional analysis .",
    "after several trials , the 60806089 @xmath12 region was found to be adequate ( i.e. , a satisfactory fit is accomplished with our @xmath20 values given in table 2 ) , which we decided to adopt .",
    "note that , apart from those given in table 2 , all lines listed in kurucz and bell s ( 1995 ) compilation were included as background opacities .",
    "the best - fit theoretically synthesized spectra along with the observed spectra are shown in figures 1a and b. such established abundances are given in table 4 .",
    "similarly , the c and o abundances from [ c  i ] 8727 and o  i 6158 lines were obtained by this technique , since these line features are delicately weak and more or less blended with other species . as a result of the analyses of these two line features , the abundances of si and fe",
    "were simultaneously obtained as by - products .",
    "note that spectral portions , where the line data are so insufficient that the observed spectrum could not be reproduced ( e.g.,around 6157.3 @xmath12 for the case of lower temperature stars ) , were masked ( i.e. , excluded from judging the goodness of fit ) in the process of automatic fitting .",
    "figures 2 ( 8727  @xmath12 region analysys ) and 3 ( 6157  @xmath12 region analysis ) show the appearance of the fit , and the resulting abundances are presented in table 4 .      in order to estimate the uncertainties involved with the ambiguities in the atmospheric parameters",
    ", we selected @xmath22 and and 70 vir as the respresentatives of higher @xmath4 and lower @xmath4 stars and evaluated the abundance variations in response to changing @xmath4 ( by + 150  k ) , @xmath16 ( by + 0.3 ) , and @xmath17 ( by + 0.5  km  s@xmath23 ) .",
    "the results are given in table 5 , from which we may state that errors caused by uncertainties in these parameters are not very significant considering the reasonable consistency of the published values ( cf . subsection 3.1 ) .      in table 6",
    ", we give the final results of the abundances which will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "as for the volatile elements , we adopted a mean value when two or more abundances from different line indicators are available . in this averaging process",
    ", a half weight was assigned to the c and o abundance derived from the forbidden lines ( [ c  i ] 8727 and [ o  i ] 6300 ) in view of their comparatively less reliability due to the suspected blending effect , i.e. , with unknown species for [ c  i ] ( gonzalez et al . 2001 ) and with the ni  i line for [ o  i ] ( allende prieto et al . 2001 ) .    meanwhile , regarding the refractory elements ( si , ti , v , fe , co , and ni ) , we adopted the abundances from the 60806089 @xmath12 fitting analysis , since we consider the results for these 6 elements from this 60806089 @xmath12 region is sufficiently accurate .",
    "the @xmath0 values presented in table 6 were taken from field ( 1974 ) for cno , and from wasson ( 1985 ) for the remaining elements .",
    "the resulting fe abundances of the program stars ( table 6 ) are compared with the literaure values ( table 1 ) in figure 4 , where we can see that both are in fairly reasonable agreement .",
    "the mean for those 14 stars with planets is @xmath24[fe / h]@xmath25 , which confirms the mild enrichment of metallicity as has been already reported ( cf .",
    "section 1 ) , though a rather large diversity is observed ( e.g. , @xmath26 crb is evidently metal - deficient , though its companion may actually not be a planet as remarked in the footnote to table 1 ) .",
    "figures 5a  e show the comparison of the abundances of five refractory elements ( si , ti , v , co , and ni ) with the fe abundance . we may state from this figure that the abundances of those elements scale with that of fe , which is an expected tendency because these belong to the same group in terms of @xmath0 ( 13001500 k ) .",
    "the reason for the appreciable systematic difference of [ co / h ] by 0.10.2 dex relative to [ fe / h ] ( cf .",
    "figure 5d ) may be related to the weakness of this line ( especially for higher @xmath4 stars ; cf . figure 1a ) , by which the reliability of the results may be more or less lowered .",
    "the results of [ c / h ] , [ n / h ] , [ o / h ] , [ s / h ] , and [ zn / h ] are compared with [ fe / h ] in figures 6a - e , respectively .",
    "these figures suggest that _ the abundances of all these five volatile elements scale with that of fe_. cet ( observed also in figure 5 ) is ( at least partly ) attributed to the consequence of the galactic chemical evolution for @xmath27-process elements ( e.g. , o , s , si , and ti ) , for which metal - deficient stars ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath28  0 ) are known to show [ @xmath27/fe ]  @xmath29  0 . however , the reason why this tendency more or less appears in other ( non-@xmath27 ) elements is not clear . ] especially , the trend of [ c / fe ]  @xmath28  0 for metal - rich planet - harboring stars , which was once reported before ( cf .",
    "section 1 ) , can not be confirmed .",
    "hence , our results suggest that the tendency predicted from the `` self - enrichment '' hypothesis , [ x / h ]  @xmath28  [ fe / h ] for metal - enriched planet - harboring stars ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath29  0 ) , is not observed at all .",
    "( even a weak inversed trend , [ x / h ]  @xmath29  [ fe / h ] , appears to exist such as for n or s. )    if fractionated solid materials have something to do with any chemical peculiarity in photospheric abundances , some kind of anti - correlation between the abundances of voilatile and refractory elements is to be expected .",
    "let us consider , for example , the case of a - type stars ( including @xmath30 boo stars ) .",
    "in this class of stars , [ c / h ] is known to be clearly anti - correlated with [ si / h ] , which is suspected as due to the differential accretion of gas and dust in late stages of star formation ( see , e.g. , holweger , strenburg 1993 ) . on the contrary , in the present case ,",
    "c and si behave themselves quite similarly with each other , as shown in figure 7 ( compare this figure with their figure 2 ) .",
    "we also investigated if there is any systematic trend in [ x / h ] with respect to @xmath0 , such that reported by smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for a subset of planet - harboring stars .",
    "we calculated the slope ( @xmath31 ) of the linear - regression line ( [ x / h]=@xmath32 ) determined from the [ x / h ] values of the 11 elements ( or 10 elements when n is not available ) .",
    "the results are given in 13th and 14th columns of table 6 . by inspecting these @xmath31 values ,",
    "the signs of which are randomly positive or negative without showing any systematic dependence with the orbital period / radius of the planets , we may state that the tendency of positive @xmath31 expected from the self - enrichment hypothesis ( cf .",
    "section 1 ) can not be observed .",
    "consequently , we consider that the `` pollution '' scenario is rather unlikely for the explanation of the metal - richness of planet - harboring stars , which may lend support for an alternative interpretation that the enhanced metallicity of stars with planets is nothing but a `` primordial '' characteristics .",
    "we determined the abundances of five volatile elements ( c , n , o , s , and zn ; low @xmath0 ) and six refractory elements ( si , ti , v , fe , co , and ni ; high @xmath0 ) for 14 bright planet - bearing stars along with 4 reference stars ( + sun ) , based on the spectra obtained by using the high - dispesion echelle spectrograph at okayama astrophysical observatory , in order to examine whether any systematic difference exists between these two groups of elements .",
    "our results indicate that all of the studied elements behave themselves quite similarly with each other ( i.e. , [ x / fe]@xmath1 ) irrespective of whether the element is volatile ( apt to be remained in gas phase ) or refractory ( apt to be included in solid materials ) . in other words",
    ", we could not observe any systematic tendency of [ x / h ] in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "these facts suggest that the `` self - pollution '' scenario proposed to explain the enhanced metallicity in planet - harboring stars , which invokes an accretion of metal - rich solid planetesimals ( deficient in volatile elements while rich in refractory ones ) onto the host star , is rather unlikely , since this mechanism would result in [ x / fe ]  @xmath28  0 for [ fe / h ]  @xmath29  0 for volatile elements and a systematic increase of [ x / h ] with @xmath0 .    therefore ,",
    "as far as those 14 bright sample stars studied in this investigation are concerned , we would consider that the tendency of metal - richness in planet - bearing stars is of primordial origin ( i.e. , higher probability of planet formation for intrinsically metal - rich gas ) rather than attributing it to an acquired character .",
    "this research have made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasburg , france .",
    "this work is based on observations carried out within the framework of the oao key project `` comprehensive spectroscopic study of stars with planets '' , which aims to understand the property of planet - harboring stars by analyzing stellar abundances and line - profles , as well as to improve the precision of measuring stellar radial velocities to a level of planet - detectability .",

    "<S> by using the high - dispersion spectra of 14 bright planet - harboring stars ( along with 4 reference stars ) observed with the new coud echelle spectrograph at okayama astrophysical observatory , we investigated the abundances of volatile elements ( c , n , o , s , zn ; low condensation temperature @xmath0 ) in order to examine whether these show any significant difference compared to the abundances of other refractory elements ( si , ti , v , fe , co , ni ; high @xmath0 ) which are known to be generally overabundant in those stars with planets , since a @xmath0-dependence is expected if the cause of such a metal - richness is due to the accretion of solid planetesimals onto the host star . </S>",
    "<S> we found , however , that all elements we studied behave themselves quite similarly to fe ( i.e. , [ x / fe]@xmath1 ) even for the case of volatile elements , which may suggest that the enhanced metallicity in those planet - bearing stars is not so much an acquired character ( by accretion of rocky material ) as rather primordial . </S>"
