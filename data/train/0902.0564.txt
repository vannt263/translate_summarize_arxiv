    "besides the specificity of the assigned interactions ( _ e.g. _ long versus short range ) , global coherence reflects also the peculiarity of the underlying network of connections .",
    "an emblematic , though extreme , example , is the fully coupled network , where each one of the @xmath0 nodes experiences a direct link with all the others . in the opposite limit",
    ", the number of links per node is independent of the size of the network . studying the modifications induced on the statistical properties of the system by such dilution",
    "has important implications for a broad class of applications .",
    "most studies have so far focused on the finite connectivity scaling , that is graphs where the number of nodes @xmath0 and the number of links @xmath4 go to infinity , keeping the ratio @xmath5 fixed .",
    "models defined on such graphs have been extensively studied in the physics literature , especially in the context of spin glasses and combinatorial optimization @xcite .",
    "several recent mathematical papers also analyze rigorously ferromagnetic ising models on such graphs  @xcite .    besides the fully coupled case",
    ", comparatively very few papers have been devoted to the infinite connectivity scaling , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 all go to infinity .",
    "bovier and gayrard  @xcite showed rigorously that , under an appropriate rescaling , the ising model defined on such graphs is completely equivalent in the infinite @xmath0 limit to its fully connected ( @xmath8 ) counterpart .",
    "on the basis of this finding , it can be safely conjectured that analogous conclusions should apply to other spin models when inspected on a similar geometry .",
    "the rigorous result by bovier and gayrard leaves however open the question of the speed of convergence towards the fully connected limit .",
    "finite size effects are indeed crucial when one aims at understanding the behavior of a finite graph . given a finite random graph with relatively high connectivity , two different approaches may be used to address this issue : on one hand , one might consider expanding around the fully connected solution of  @xcite , to compute the leading order finite @xmath0 corrections ; on the other hand , the graph under scrutiny can be seen as a realization of an erds - rnyi random graph @xcite , with high , but finite , mean connectivity .",

    "two randomly selected nodes , say @xmath9 and @xmath12 , are connected through a coupling constant @xmath13 .",
    "the number of links @xmath14 is bounded from above by @xmath15 , which corresponds to the fully connected case , since we are avoiding double edging of two sites and self wiring .",
    "we introduce the dilution parameter @xmath3 by scaling the number of links as @xmath16 , the normalization factor @xmath17 is introduced so that the fully connected topology is exactly reproduced when @xmath18 .",

    "is set to an identical reference value , say @xmath23 , if the nodes @xmath9 and @xmath12 are connected , zero otherwise . in the following",
    "we shall study the behaviour of the system as a function of the dilution rate @xmath3 . as proved in  @xcite , for @xmath3 strictly larger than its lower bound @xmath10 ,",
    "a second order phase transition of the curie - weiss type always occurs .",
    "our main goal is to characterize the behaviour of the system for a finite size @xmath0 . in the following",

    "this is achieved via the celebrated replica trick , which is based on the identity @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a assumed to be a real number .",
    "the central idea consists in carrying out the computation for all integers @xmath41 , extending the results for all @xmath41 , and performing in the end the limit for @xmath42 .",
    "in our setting the replicated partition function reads @xmath43^{n } \\nonumber\\\\       & = & \\sum_{\\{s_{i}^{a}\\ } } \\exp \\left ( \\frac{\\gamma!}{2}\\beta \\frac{1}{n^{\\gamma-1 } }       \\sum_{a}\\sum_{i\\neq j}j_{ij}s_{i}^{a}s_{j}^{a } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\       & = & \\sum_{\\{s_{i}^{a}\\ } } \\exp \\left(\\frac{\\gamma!}{2}\\beta\\frac{1}{n^{\\gamma-1 } }       \\sum_{i\\neq j}j_{ij}\\sum_{a}s_{i}^{a}s_{j}^{a } \\right)~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath44 runs over the @xmath41 replicas .",
    "averaging over the disorder returns @xmath45 where @xmath46 . recalling eq .",
