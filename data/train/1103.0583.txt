    "this radio - derived total ir luminosity is @xmath149 times smaller compared to what was found by @xcite from the ir spectral energy distribution of mm18423 + 5938 .",
    "a possible explanation for this difference is the expected evolution in @xmath52 with redshift that results from an attenuation of the radio emission due to inverse compton scattering off of cosmic microwave background photons @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to this theoretical prediction , the observed value of the radio  fir correlation has remained fairly constant with redshift ( within the uncertainties ) .",
    "for example , the value of @xmath52 used here is consistent with that found for sub - mm galaxies at @xmath57  4.4 ( @xmath54  2.16@xmath10.28 ) by @xcite , albeit with a much smaller sample size .",
    "the value of the radio  fir correlation parameter that is implied from our radio observations and the @xcite total ir luminosity is @xmath54  3.34@xmath10.11 , which is 4@xmath23 from the results of @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the large difference in the derived total ir luminosities may arise from the method applied by @xcite , who used a milky way dust model with a large grain ( cold ) component at 45 k , a small grain ( warm ) component at higher temperature and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) component to describe the mm18423 + 5938 spectral energy distribution .",
    "the pah component was constrained by an upper - limit at 24  @xmath2 m from _ spitzer _ , but since this component only dominates the rest - frame spectral energy distribution of the @xcite model below 8  @xmath2 m , and is several orders of magnitude weaker than the other components , any change in the pah strength will not significantly effect the total ir luminosity measured for mm18423 + 5938 .",
    "the small dust grain component was constrained by the 70  @xmath2 m detection with _ spitzer _ and by the upper - limits at 60 and 100  @xmath2 m from _",
    "iras_. however , as already discussed by @xcite , there is a 9  arcsec offset between the 1.2  mm position of mm18423 + 5938 and the possible 70  @xmath2 m counterpart . due to the higher astrometric precision of our radio data",
    ", we find this offset to be 10.8@xmath11.9  arcsec and can now clearly establish that these two sources are not associated with each other at the 5.7@xmath23 level ( note that our analysis also includes a 1.7 arcsec uncertainty for the _ spitzer _ 70  @xmath2 m position ) . by using the limiting flux density of the 70  @xmath2 m imaging as a constraint ( @xmath58  5.7  mjy ; 1@xmath23 ) , we find that the luminosity of the small dust grain component must be at least a factor of @xmath145 smaller than was originally found by @xcite .",
    "however , this is not sufficient to fully explain the difference between the total ir luminosities derived using the different methods , even though the small dust grain component dominated the rest - frame spectral energy distribution between @xmath14830  @xmath2 m and contributed @xmath1470 per cent to the total emission of the @xcite model .",
    "the large dust grain component provides most of the total ir luminosity from sub - mm galaxies and dominates the spectral energy distribution of mm18423 + 5938 from at least @xmath14301000  @xmath2 m . to investigate the properties of this component",
    ", we have used a single temperature modified blackbody spectrum , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the dust temperature of the large dust grain component and @xmath61 is the emissivity , which we assume is 1.5@xmath10.5 .",
    "we first attempted to fit a wide range of dust temperatures between 20 to 45  k and found that @xmath60 ( and hence the luminosity ) is not at all well constrained by the three mm detections of mm18423 + 5938 and the four non - detections at shorter wavelengths ( the reduced @xmath62 of these fits were typically around 0.7 to 0.8 ) .",
    "this is because the peak and the general shape of the spectral energy distribution , which are defined by the dust temperature , are not well sampled by the available photometric data ( see fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) .",
    "( 6,7.6 ) ( -1.4,-0.5 )    we have attempted to place some constraint on the temperature of the large dust grain component by measuring the total ir luminosity for various dust temperature models and comparing with the result from the radio  fir correlation .",
    "we calculated the fir luminosity by integrating the best - fitting modified blackbody spectrum between 40 and 120  @xmath2 m .",
    "a bolometric correction term was used to convert the fir luminosity to the total ir luminosity , such that , @xmath63  1.91 @xcite .",
    "we find that the large dust grain temperature of mm18423 + 5938 has to be @xmath64  24@xmath16  k with a peak wavelength at around 150  @xmath2 m to reproduce the radio - derived total ir luminosity .",
    "the error in the dust temperature includes the uncertainty introduced by the radio  fir correlation and the unknown dust emissivity .",
    "recent results from _ herschel _ have shown that high redshift sub - mm galaxies have cold dust temperatures of 34@xmath15  k ( @xcite ; see also @xcite who find 36@xmath18  k ) , and peak rest - frame wavelengths of around 100  @xmath2 m .",
    "the predicted cold dust temperature of mm18423 + 5938 is lower than these values , which suggests that the star - forming conditions of this galaxy are not as extreme as the typical sub - mm galaxy at redshift 2 ( see below for further discussion ) .",
    "the single temperature modified blackbody approximation that we have used here is probably too simple to fully characterize the cold dust component of the spectral energy distribution .",
    "more sophisticated radiative transfer models ( e.g. @xcite ) for the full spectral energy distribution of mm18423 + 5938 can be tested once additional data have been collected .",
    "however , our analysis has shown that with the available photometric data , the rest - frame spectral energy distribution between 81000  @xmath2 m is not sufficiently well constrained to independently yield a reliable total ir luminosity .",
    "observations at 100 to 850  @xmath2 m with , for example _ herschel _ and scuba2 , will be needed to properly constrain the spectral energy distribution and the dust temperature of mm18423 + 5938 ( e.g. @xcite ) so that the total ir luminosity can be measured in this way .    finally , as an independent check of our radio - derived total ir luminosity for mm18423 + 5938",
    "we have used the relation between the co ( 3@xmath322 ) luminosity and the fir luminosity , which for high redshift sub - mm galaxies has a ratio of @xmath65  194@xmath120 l@xmath11 / k  kms@xmath7  pc@xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the co ( 3@xmath322 ) transition was not observed by @xcite , but based on their co spectral energy distribution this transition is predicted to have a flux - density of @xmath1418  mjy .",
    "we find for our radio - derived fir luminosity that the co ( 3@xmath322 ) transition should have a flux - density of @xmath1412@xmath67  mjy , assuming the same 175 kms@xmath7 line width as for the co ( 4@xmath323 ) transition .",
    "this is in good agreement with what is predicted for the co ( 3@xmath322 ) transition from the spectral energy distribution .",
    "therefore , we find that the best estimate of the total ir luminosity of mm18423 + 5938 currently comes from the radio imaging presented here , under the assumption that the radio  fir correlation holds out to redshift 4 .",
    "the radio luminosity density of mm18423 + 5938 at 1.4 ghz is about 1.5 orders of magnitude higher than the typical near - infrared selected star - forming galaxy found between redshift 1.42 and 2 @xcite and is about 9 times higher compared to the population of radio selected sub - mm galaxies found at @xmath57  2.5 @xcite .",
    "the radio luminosity density is also 3 - 8 times higher compared to 4 out of 5 ( unlensed ) spectroscopically confirmed sub - mm galaxies at @xmath57  4 with radio detections ; the exception being the sub - mm galaxy gn20 @xcite , which is known to host a radio - loud agn . the unusually high radio luminosity density could therefore suggest that the emission from mm18423 + 5938 is predominately due to a radio - loud agn .",
    "however , since the co spectral energy distribution peaks at @xmath68  5 and is well fit by a single low excitation temperature model , strong heating by a central agn can be ruled out .",
    "the radio - derived total ir luminosity of mm18423 + 5938 is 6 - 8 times larger than what was found for typical sub - mm galaxies at redshift @xmath57  2.5 @xcite , but is consistent with the extreme values ( @xmath69  3@xmath410@xmath10  l@xmath11 ) reported for hyper - luminous sub - mm galaxies out to @xmath57  2 @xcite .",
    "however , these extreme luminosity galaxies also have cold dust temperatures of @xmath70  52@xmath16  k , which is significantly higher than what we found for mm18423 + 5938 . using the relation between the total ir luminosity and the star - formation rate by @xcite , the radio - inferred star - formation rate of mm18423 + 5938",
    "is found to be sfr  = 9.4@xmath12@xmath410@xmath13  @xmath6  m@xmath11  yr@xmath7 .",
    "this is for a continuous starburst model of 10 to 100 myr duration , is valid over the mass range 0.1 to 100  m@xmath11 and assumes a @xcite initial mass function .",
    "again , the star - formation rate is much higher than what has been found for the sub - mm galaxy population at @xmath57  2.5 ( 400  m@xmath11  yr@xmath7 ; e.g. @xcite ) , and is not consistent with the moderate excitation temperature implied by the co spectral energy distribution .",
    "gravitational lensing can be used to explain these contradictions between the observed properties ( i.e. the radio luminosity density , total ir luminosity and star - formation rate ) and the relatively low cold dust and co excitation temperatures .",
    "this is because the temperatures are related to the shape of the spectral energy distribution ( either for the continuum or co spectral line transitions ) and are not effected by gravitational lensing , providing there is little or no differential magnification , whereas the luminosities scale with the magnification . since the total ir luminosity and star - formation rate that have been calculated from the radio imaging are @xmath149 times lower than those found by @xcite , the need for a very high gravitational lens magnification ( @xmath14300 ) to explain the emission from mm18423 + 5938 is no longer required . by assuming a reasonable magnification of between 10 and 50 from a possible gravitational lens , the predicted unlensed total ir luminosity and star - formation rate of mm18423 + 5938 decreases to 1.15.6@xmath410@xmath19  l@xmath11 and 190940  m@xmath11  yr@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the unlensed radio luminosity density would decrease to 0.52.3@xmath410@xmath71  w  hz@xmath7 .",
    "the range of assumed lensing magnifications is consistent with what has been found for other star - forming galaxies at high redshift that are gravitationally lensed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "high sensitivity observations at sub - arcsec resolution with , for example , the expanded very large array ( evla ) or the multi - element radio linked interferometer network ( _ e_-merlin ) could be carried out to image the radio emission from mm18423 + 5938 and to confirm the lensing hypothesis for this system .",
    "such observations would allow the actual magnification from the gravitational lens to be determined and find out if there is any contaminating radio emission from the foreground gravitational lensing galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "further observations at milliarcsecond resolutions with very long baseline interferometry could be used to determine whether there is any contribution to the total radio flux - density from an agn ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "mm18423 + 5938 at redshift 3.9296 was thought to have an extremely large total ir luminosity ( 4.8@xmath410@xmath25  @xmath6  l@xmath11 ; @xcite ) , and based on this was believed to be highly magnified by a gravitational lens .",
    "we have presented new imaging at 1.4 ghz that detects the galaxy at radio wavelengths for the first time and determines a more precise position . using the well - established radio ",
    "fir correlation , we find that the total ir luminosity of this galaxy is @xmath149 times lower than what was previously calculated from an analysis of the ir spectral energy distribution , which is considered unreliable due to the limited photometric data that is currently available . in particular , we find that the object detected at 70  @xmath2 m , which partly led to the high total ir luminosity , is not associated with mm18423 + 5938 .",
    "the radio - derived properties are still quite large ( @xmath8  =  5.6@xmath9@xmath410@xmath10  @xmath6  l@xmath11 and sfr  =  9.4@xmath12@xmath410@xmath13  @xmath6  m@xmath11  yr@xmath7 ) given the moderate excitation temperature of the co lines and the low cold dust temperature ( @xmath64  24@xmath16  k ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that mm18423 + 5938 is probably gravitationally lensed , as @xcite suggested .",
    "we find that extreme magnification factors are no longer required ; a reasonable lensing magnification between 1050 would give a star - formation rate and total ir luminosity that are consistent with a typical sub - mm galaxy at redshift @xmath142 .",
