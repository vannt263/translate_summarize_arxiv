    "all atoms with an even number of neutrons satisfy bose statistics , which accounts for about 75 per cent of the atoms in the periodic table .",
    "based on the bose - einstein statistics a gas of non - interacting massive bosons condenses below a certain temperature @xmath1 , in which the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) occurs .",
    "this is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon characterized by spontaneous quantum coherence persisting over macroscopic length and time scales . in dilute atomic gases",

    "the sorting phase can be described as a bec of bosonic quasi - particles , in which the magnetic field acts to preserve the number of bosons .",

    "a macroscopic number of bosons condense into a single quantum statethe state of lowest energy .",
    "the quantum coherence of bose - einstein condensation dates back to the prediction of einstein , based on bose s work , in 1924 .    in the diluted bec the macroscopic wave function",

    "the focus of this article is to review systematic concepts and experimental realizations of a transition to a bec phase in dtn , where bosons are quanta of magnetic excitations in a magnetically ordered ensemble of magnetic moments .",
    "although there is no consensus on a specific name for the magnetic excitations , we will use the word magnon for the excitations in insulating systems generated by the application of a magnetic field .",
    "this denomination follows the nomenclature used by the first papers on bec in magnetic insulators , since elementary excitations in antiferromagnetic systems are called magnons @xcite .",
    "we hope that the experimental evidence for bec in dtn will stimulate new research in this fascinating quantum phenomenon .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 reviews the concepts of the ideal bec at finite temperature and the nature of bec when magnons are induced by the application of a magnetic field .",

    "decreasing the temperatures , the wave - packet becomes correlated for @xmath9 @xmath10 a. for particles in the same quantum state , such as bosons at very low temperatures , the system is represented by a single macroscopic wave - function.,width=264 ]",
    "according to the heisenberg uncertainly principle the position of a particle is smeared out over a distance given by the thermal @xmath7 @xmath8 wavelength @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath13 is the particle mass , and @xmath14 is the system temperature @xcite . at room temperature @xmath9 is typically one hundred thousand times smaller than the average spacing between the particles , @xmath6 .",
    "this means that the matter waves of the individual particles are uncorrelated , and the system can therefore be described by classical boltzmann statistics .",
    "as the system is cooled , eventually the distance between two particles becomes the same as the @xmath7 @xmath8 wavelength , @xmath6 @xmath10 @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the packet - functions of adjacent particles overlap , causing the atoms to lose their identity , and the behavior of the system becomes strongly correlated .",
    "the system is now governed by quantum statistics .",
    "the density distribution of the condensate is represented by a single macroscopic wave function with a well - defined amplitude and phase , which are the order parameters of the system , and a bose einstein condensate is formed .",

    "may be expressed by the power law dependence equation within the bec picture as    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the riemann zeta function , and @xmath17 @xcite .    for diluted bosons with small interaction , meaning that the two - particle scattering length @xmath18 is much shorter than the interatomic distance , the observed",
    "@xmath1 agrees well with the theoretical expectation for free particles . for less diluted systems ,",
    "the interaction between bosons gives rise to a small shift of @xmath19 @xcite : @xmath20    various authors have attempted to determine the value of @xmath21 , which was found to be in the range @xmath22 , although all authors agree on the functional form .",
    "there are several candidates for bec . a first attempt to experimentally observe bec",
    "was made with superfluidity .",
    "when @xmath23he is cooled to a critical temperature of 2.17k , the liquid density drops , and fractions of the liquid become superfluid .",
    "the strong interaction of @xmath23he in liquid form prevents perfect condensation .",
    "the formation of cooper pairs of electrons , which act like bosons , is also evidence of the condensation effect , which produces superconductivity @xcite .",
    "however , in these systems , a macroscopic wave function provides only a phenomenological description of the superfluid state .",
    "by contrast , the macroscopic wave function of pure condensates is directly connected with the microscopic degrees of freedom , providing a complete and quantitative description of both static and dynamic phenomena .",
    "this description should cover systems showing a true bec phase .",
    "some systems were cited , such as excitons - polaritons , which are light - mass quasi - particles usually produced by optical excitations in semiconductors , and photons confined in a cavity @xcite .",
    "however , excitons have a very short lifetime and the photons are absorbed by the walls . because the bec requires a thermalization time to condense in which the number of particles is conserved",
    ", their characteristics almost prevent these systems from becoming becs .",
    "all these systems are believed to be defective condensates .",
    "recently it has been reported that a gas of magnons at room temperature can be continuously overpopulating the lowest energy level , which shows characteristics of bec , when it is driven by microwave pumping.@xcite    on the other hand , diluted magnons in equilibrium can be pure condensates at low temperatures , just like cold gas .",
    "magnetic insulators with magnetic ions are characterized by a gap separating the singlet ground state from the lowest - energy excited state .",
    "if the gap is closed by the zeeman effect , the resulting quasiparticles can undergo the bose - einstein condensation transition .",
    "the bec phase in quantum magnets is an xy antiferromagnetic state in which the spins spontaneously choose a particular orientation in the xy plane .",
    "the number of bosons is proportional to the net magnetization , i.  e. , the @xmath24 component of the spins . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of condensed bosons is proportional to the antiferromagnetically ordered @xmath25 component of the spins .",
    "thus the xy antiferromagnetic order parameter maps directly onto the order parameter for bose - einstein condensation .",
    "it has a magnitude ( size of the spins in the spin language , or number of bosons in the boson language ) as well as a phase ( direction of the spins ) . in the particle language ,",
    "the boson number can be tuned by the magnetic field . for this to occur",
    ", the system must be an xy magnet , i.  e. , must have uniaxial symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the applied magnetic field .",
    "therefore only certain quantum magnets can be treated as becs .",
    "we note that in real systems there will always be terms that break the uniaxial symmetry , such as dipole - dipole interactions and spin - orbit interactions .",
    "consequently the theory is valid only when these terms are significantly smaller than the temperature . at very low temperatures",
    "any real quantum magnet will cross over to the ising universality class .",
    "bosons can be achieved by creating and maintaining a large number of quasi - particles in a system .",
    "one special case is the creation of magnons at the induced magnetic - ordering phase .",
    "figure  2 shows the phase diagram in the temperature - versus field plane of an induced antiferromagnetic ordering in a field whose magnetic ions are strongly correlated .",
    "magnons can be created and , under special conditions , condensed into the ordered phase @xcite .",
    "a procedure for studying the properties of the phase diagram is to understand the transitions that appear when the boundaries separating the phases are crossed @xcite . when a border is crossed vertically to enter the ordered phase a thermal phase transition results , driven by thermal fluctuations .",
    "the magnetic and thermal energies compete . at temperatures near zero , by contrast , there are no thermal fluctuations and a quantum transition results , driven by quantum fluctuations . the magnetic energy and the zero - point energies compete .",
    "this second - order quantum transition to the bec phase is free of interactions . however ,",
    "including even week interactions into the description of the condensation has proven to be a great challenge , which was overcome by introducting effective interactions @xcite .",
    "these interactions , well - approximated by a contact pseudo - potential , are central to arriving at the gross - pitaevskii equation . understanding the behavior of the phase transition near zero temperature is understanding the quantum behavior of the system . the transition to the bec state",
    "is characterized by specific characteristics of the thermodynamic properties .",
    "we studied bec in magnons because condensation occurs at temperatures that are much more accessible than the condensation of particles .",
    "the phase diagram from the normal to the bec state can be studied via thermodynamic properties such as magnetization , temperature and specific heat , which are measured when the phase boundary is crossed by sweeping the field or the temperature , as indicated by the arrows.,width=264 ]    since according to  ( 1 ) @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath26 , we would like to maximize @xmath27 to observe the bec at easily accessible temperatures .",
    "however , that equation assumes that the bosons are free particles and is therefore only valid in the limit of low density .",
    "we can overcome this problem by considering that @xmath1 is also dependent on the boson mass @xmath13 . by minimizing @xmath13",
    ", we can observe the bec at relatively high temperatures without sacrificing the condition of low boson density .",
    "in quantum magnets , the boson mass is sufficiently small , so that the bec can be realized at temperatures of a few kelvin , in contrast to cold atoms , in which temperatures in the nano - kelvin range are needed to observe the bec in magnetic optical traps @xcite .",
    "in addition to the properties of nicl@xmath0 - 4sc(nh@xmath0)@xmath0 , one needs well - prepared samples for studies under laboratory conditions .",
    "single crystals of dichloro-@xmath28thiourea - nickel ( dtn ) were grown by dissolving a large excess of nickel chloride in a saturated solution of thiourea @xcite .",
    "the crystals grow after about two weeks in a solution maintained at a temperature of 35 degrees centigrade .",

    "the field - induced phase by level crossing is permitted in compounds that follow stringent requirements : in addition to having a multiplet above the non - magnetic singlet , the metal ion must reside in a site of uniaxial symmetry , so that the magnetic field can be applied simultaneously parallel to the anisotropic @xmath42 axis for all magnetic ions .",
    "the parameters for dtn and its crystal symmetry then yield magnetic properties that can be studied within this picture .    in dtn the high single - ion anisotropy ( energy gap ) is responsible for the splitting of the @xmath33 spin triplet of the ni@xmath43 in a @xmath44 ground state and an @xmath45 excited doublet considerably higher in energy .",
    "the excited doublet can hop to a neighboring doublet via the transverse component of the magnetic exchange interaction @xmath39 , resulting in delocalized states analogous to the delocalized electronic states in crystals . at zero field",
    "the small exchange interaction between the spins is not enough to induce long - range ordering , even at zero temperature .",

    "all sites are occupied by bosons and the system enters a second mott insulating phase @xcite .      at the induced phase the ni magnetic spins",
    "do not have any preferred orientation in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field , and the antiferromagnetic order is xy - like .",
    "the tetragonal crystal structure provides a uniaxial crystal - field symmetry about the direction of the applied field .",
    "it is this symmetry that enforces number conservation among the bosons .",

    "boson - number conservation is a key condition that separates bosonic systems that condense from those that do not .",
    "formally , the phenomenon of bec requires the conservation of particle number .",
