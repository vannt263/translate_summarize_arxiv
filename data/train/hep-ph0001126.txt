    "the title of this talk is rather broad . specifically what i will be talking about today is relic density constraints on supersymmetric models , and i will focus in particular on bounds on minimal supergravity ( msugra ) .",
    "i ll begin with a brief reminder of the notation of supersymmetry , then give an introduction to relic densities , how they are computed , and how we can use them to constrain models of low - energy supersymmetry .",
    "i ll then discuss coannihilation in general and show how it dramatically relaxes the cosmological upper bound on the msugra masses .",
    "finally , i ll give an example of constraints ( on cp violating phases in msugra ) which are _ not _ relaxed by the weakened mass limits .",
    "since previous speakers have introduced the supersymmetric standard model , i will give only a brief reminder , in order to present the particle content and parameters and to set the notation .",
    "recall that susy essentially doubles the particle content of the standard model ( table  [ table : susy ] ) .",
    "each fermion ( in fact each fermion chiral state ) has a spin-0 partner sfermion , the gauge bosons have spin-1/2 partner gauginos , and the degrees of freedom of the higgs sector , which now contains two higgs su(2 ) doublets , have spin-1/2 higgsino partners .",
    "the four neutral gauginos and higgsinos mix into `` neutralino '' states @xmath0 , so that an arbitrary neutralino is a linear combination @xmath1 where the @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the partners of the @xmath4 and neutral @xmath5 gauge bosons and are linear combinations of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the lightest of the the neutralinos @xmath8 tends to be the lightest supersymmetric particle , and in the models of interest for dark matter , @xmath8 tends to be @xmath2-like , i.e. @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , the charged gauginos and higgsinos mix into two `` charginos '' , @xmath10 .",
    ".[table : susy]the susy partners of standard model particles .",
    "[ cols=\">,^ , < \" , ]     if one includes flavor structure into the sfermion and trilinear masses , there are over 100 new parameters associated with softly broken supersymmetry@xcite .",
    "this large number of parameters severely limits the predictive power of the the mssm , and in practice , simplifications to the set of susy parameters are always made .",
    "one of the most popular and better - motivated choices is inspired by minimal supergravity ( msugra ) . in msugra ,",
    "several of the masses are taken degenerate , so that @xmath11 at the scale @xmath12 where the gauge couplings unify . the parameters are then evolved to the electroweak scale using the renormalization group equations to compute the low - energy spectrum .",
    "due the rge running , the masses of the sfermions depend on both @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are fixed by the conditions of correct electroweak symmetry breaking , which leaves @xmath17 as the free parameters of msugra .",
    "i will subsequently concentrate on the msugra model , but qualitatively similar results apply in the general mssm .",
    "the possibility of a significant relic abundance of neutralinos is partly due to r - parity , which is typically imposed on susy models in order to prevent rapid proton decay . under this new symmetry ,",
    "standard models particles have r - charge @xmath18 , while their superpartners have r - charge @xmath19 .",
    "since r - parity is multiplicatively conserved , this implies that all vertices must contain an even number of susy particles , and hence that the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is stable .",
    "since it is stable over cosmological time scales , the lsp is a dark matter candidate , and we can use limits on its relic abundance to constrain susy models , as i ll describe next .",
    "now , the very early universe was hot and dense ; particles interacted rapidly , and the lsps , which i will denote @xmath20 , were kept in chemical equilibrium with the standard model particles in the thermal bath , primarily via processes in which two susy particles annihilate into standard model particles , and the inverse processes in which standard model particles annihilate to produce two susy particles .    at temperatures much larger than the mass of the @xmath20 ,",
    "the number density of @xmath20 s was simply a spin factor times the number density of photons . as the universe expanded and cooled , the temperature eventually fell below the mass of the @xmath20 , and the number density of @xmath20 s began to drop exponentially .",
    "@xmath21 { n_\\gamma ( { m_{\\dg\\chi\\bl}\\over t})^{3/2 } e^{-m_{\\dg\\chi\\bl}/t } } & { t\\la m_{\\dg\\chi\\bl } } \\end{array } \\right . } \\label{eq : neq}\\ ] ]    if this were the end of the story , it would be a rather dull tale : since the temperature of the universe today is about @xmath22 k@xmath23 ev , the number density of a , say , 100 gev @xmath20 would be suppressed vis -  - vis that of photons by a factor @xmath24 .",
    "i.e. , there would be no @xmath20 s left now .",
    "however , in an expanding universe , this conclusion does not hold , because at some point the @xmath20 s fall out of chemical equilibrium with the bath . specifically , this occurs when the @xmath20 annihilation rate falls below the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath25 .",
    "at this point , the @xmath20 s can not find each other in order to annihilate sufficiently fast for their number density to track the rapid exponential fall of ( [ eq : neq ] ) .",
    "the number density of @xmath20 s subsequently `` freezes out '' and simply falls with the volume of the universe , @xmath26 .",
    "to be more explicit , the number density of @xmath20 s evolves according to the boltzmann equation , @xmath27 here @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the scale factor of the universe , and so the first term on the rhs of ( [ eq : boltz ] ) simply represents the volume suppression of the number density of the @xmath20 .",
    "the first term in parentheses describes the destruction of the @xmath20 through annihilation , and the last term describes the production of @xmath20 particles from interactions of the thermal bath .",
    "an approximate analytic solution to ( [ eq : boltz ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the present mass density of @xmath20 particles in units of the critical density @xmath32 required to close the universe , @xmath33 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at freeze out , @xmath34 is the current hubble parameter @xmath35 in units of 100 km / s / mpc , and where the thermally averaged annihilation cross - section has been expanded in powers of @xmath36 : @xmath37 the temperature at freeze - out is typically well below the mass of the @xmath20 , so that @xmath38 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmav ] ) is a good expansion energy .",
    "however , these occur only in a limited region of parameter space and are not significant for us here . ] .",
    "now , the key feature of ( [ eq : ohsq ] ) is that if the @xmath20 annihilation cross - section is reduced , the @xmath20 freeze out of chemical equilibrium earlier , when their density has had less time to track the exponential boltzmann suppression ( [ eq : neq ] ) , and the @xmath20 relic abundance is larger . but",
    "a lower bound of 12 gyr on the age of the universe ( along with the assumption that @xmath39 ) implies that @xmath40 . or in other words , a lower bound on the age of the universe implies a lower bound on the @xmath20 annihilation rate , and this is the feature we will primarily exploit to constrain susy models .      let us now turn to the mssm and see what these cosmological considerations do for us .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle is typically the lightest neutralino , and in many models , including msugra , the lightest neutralino is a quite pure bino @xmath41 . in the early universe ,",
    "binos annihilate primarily via sfermion exchange into fermion pairs .",
    "now , if the mass of the sfermions is large , then @xmath42 annihilation in the early universe is suppressed , and @xmath43 is raised . from the last section , we see that the lower bound on the age of the universe implies an _ upper bound _ on the sfermion masses , and hence on both msugra parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these limits are nicely complementary to those coming from direct searches for susy particles , which typically give lower bounds on the susy mass parameters .",
    "the cosmological limits can be translated into @xmath44 plane @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : noc ] .",
    "the light - shaded region corresponds to @xmath45 ; the area above this region is excluded . below this region ,",
    "@xmath46 , so that another component of the dark matter would be required .",
    "this latter is not a bound in the same sense as the upper limit , since we do nt know for certain that any of the dark matter is composed of neutralinos . in the narrow chimney near @xmath47gev , @xmath48 , and s - channel annihilation through the higgs pole",
    "can bring the relic abundance of neutralinos below 0.3 , regardless of the sfermion masses .",
    "in the dark shaded region , the lsp is the right - handed stau , which is excluded by the very tight limits on the abundance of charged dark matter @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : noc ] we also display current experimental limits : the light dotted contour represents the bound from searches for sleptons at lep , while the the dashed line is a chargino isomass contour of 95 gev , which approximates the lep189 chargino bounds at large @xmath13 .",
    "note that the chargino bound excludes almost all of the higgs pole chimney .",
    "the most significant experimental bound at this value of @xmath49 comes from higgs searches at lep .",
    "the dot - dashed contour represents a light higgs mass of 95 gev , which approximates the higgs limit from lep189 , and the bulk of the cosmologically allowed region is excluded .",
    "now , the higgs mass itself is sensitive to @xmath49 , and as @xmath49 is dropped , the dot - dashed contour moves quickly to the right .",
    "it is clear that for some value of @xmath49 , the higgs contour moves to the right of the light - shaded region entirely , and this and lower values of @xmath49 are consequently excluded .",
    "the current bound at this value of @xmath49 is around 102 gev @xcite , and these arguments imply a lower bound on @xmath49 of 3.7 ( 2.8 ) for @xmath50 .",
    "we ll see in the next section that these constraints are weakened when we consider coannihilation .",
    "so far , we have ignored interactions of the lsp with heavier susy particles . recall that the lsps freeze out of chemical equilibrium when they re very cold ( @xmath51 ) , so that if the mass splitting between the lsp and the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) is @xmath52 , the number density of nlsps at freeze - out is boltzmann suppressed with respect to that of lsps by a factor which is @xmath53 .",
    "therefore we do nt have to worry about nlsp interactions .",
    "if , on the other hand , the lsp and nlsp are closely degenerate in mass , then the nlsp interactions near freeze - out may affect the lsp relic density .",
    "this produces two competing effects .",
    "first , the nlsps freeze out of chemical equilibrium with the standard model bath at the same time as the lsps and subsequently decay into lsps , and so a significant nlsp abundance at freeze - out can increase the relic lsp density .",
    "typically a larger effect is that since the nlsp interactions contribute to the exchange of particle number between susy and standard model particles ( and can dominate , as we ll see below ) , the susy particles remain in chemical equilibrium with the thermal bath for longer and track the equilibrium down to lower temperatures , and this reduces the lsp relic abundance .",
    "how degenerate do the lsp and nlsp states have to be in order to produce a significant effect ?",
    "well , @xmath54 if the nlsp is 10% ( 5% ) heavier than the lsp , this ratio is @xmath55 . we see that unless the lightest states are highly degenerate , coannihilation will only be important if @xmath56 ( or @xmath57 ) @xmath58 . and msugra ( and much of the mssm ) , they are ! !",
    "consider the temperature expansion of the thermally averaged cross - section ( [ eq : sigmav ] ) .",
    "when the final state is a fermion pair ( the dominant annihilation channel for a @xmath42-like neutralino ) , @xmath59 .",
    "this dependence is due to the fact that one has identical majorana fermions in the initial state @xcite and is called `` p - wave suppression '' . since @xmath60 is small at freeze - out , this suppresses the annihilation rate ( and enhances the relic abundance ) by an order of magnitude .",
    "coannihilation cross - sections do not have such a suppression and are typically an order of magnitude larger , and the nlsp interactions can therefore dramatically reduce the susy relic abundance .",
    "these effects have been well studied in susy for higgsino - like neutralinos @xcite , where there is typically a close degeneracy between the lightest and next - to - lightest neutralinos and the lightest chargino .",
    "what we have found is that coannihilation is also an essential element in determining the cosmological upper bound on gaugino ( @xmath42 ) like neutralinos , as well @xcite .",
    "looking back at fig .",
    "[ fig : noc ] , we should nt be surprised that coannihilation may be important in msugra .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath14 occurs at the intersection of the @xmath62 contour with the the top of the region with @xmath63 , i.e. at a point where the stau and neutralino are exactly degenerate ! generally in the mssm@xmath64 , the cosmological upper bound on the mass of the @xmath42",
    "is saturated when the masses of the lightest sfermions are degenerate with @xmath65 . in msugra , the three right - handed sleptons @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the lightest sfermions and can all be close in mass to the lsp .",
    "we must therefore consider @xcite the effective annihilation cross - section @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and where @xmath71 . the complete set of initial and final states contributing to ( [ eq : sigeff ] ) is given in table  [ table : states ] .",
    "the dominant contributions to @xmath72 come from @xmath73 annihilation to gauge bosons , @xmath74 annihilation to lepton pairs and @xmath75 annihilation to a lepton plus a gauge boson .",

    "[ fig : ss ] , we show the contributions to @xmath85 ( see ( [ eq : ohsq ] ) ) for @xmath86 annihilation .",

    "as advertised , the stau cross - section is over an order of magnitude greater than that for the neutralinos , which is p - wave suppressed .",

    "the ratio of the solid contours at this point is greater than an order of magnitude , as above . as @xmath96 increases ,",
    "the density @xmath97 of sleptons becomes boltzmann suppressed , and the slepton - slepton contribution falls with two powers of @xmath97 and drops below the slepton - neutralino contribution at @xmath98 .",

    "[ fig : noc ] , but now with coannihilation included .",
    "we see that the light - shaded area now bends away from the forbidden stau lsp region and creates a large allowed trunk which lies on top of the line @xmath100",
    ". eventually , for large enough @xmath14 , the top of the trunk falls below the @xmath100 line , but this does nt happen until much larger values of @xmath14 and @xmath13 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] . some features of the new cosmologically allowed region to note : the upper bounds on @xmath13 and @xmath14 are relaxed to @xmath101 gev and @xmath102 gev , respectively .",
    "the width of the new allowed trunk is significant , from 30 - 50 gev in @xmath13 for @xmath14 up to @xmath103 gev .",
    "we ve only shown the cosmologically interesting region for one value of @xmath49 , but the shape is very similar for all small to moderate @xmath49 .",
    "the position of the line @xmath100 can vary somewhat with @xmath104 ; however , the width of the trunk above the line is quite insensitive to @xmath104 , as is the upper bound on @xmath14 .",
    "this relaxes dramatically the cosmological upper bound on the neutralino mass in msugra from about 200 gev to close to 600 gev .",
    "it will therefore take the reach of the lhc to probe the full cosmologically interesting region .",
    "lastly , the bounds on @xmath49 from combining the higgs search limits with relic density constraints are now weakened , from 3.7 ( 2.8 ) to 2.8 ( 2.3 ) for @xmath105 .",
    "as an application , we ll now examine to what extent the relaxation of our upper limits on @xmath14 affects constraints on cp violation in the mssm .",
    "we ll start with a brief reminder of where cp violation arises in our model . recall",
    "that in the mssm , new cp violating phases @xmath106 and @xmath107 accompany the ( in principle ) complex parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 , introduced in the first part of this talk .",
    "these phases then appear in the low energy lagrangian in the neutralino and chargino mass matrices ( in the case of @xmath106 ) and in the left - right sfermion mixing terms ( both @xmath106 and @xmath110 ) .",
    "the new sources for cp violation then contribute to the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of standard model fermions , and the tight experimental constraints on the edms of the electron , neutron and mercury atom place severe limits on the sizes of @xmath106 and @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "the edms generated by @xmath106 and @xmath110 are sufficiently small if either 1 )  the phases are very small ( @xmath111 ) , or 2 )  the susy masses are very large ( @xmath112  ( a few tev ) ) , or 3 )  there are large cancellations between different contributions to the edms . in msugra , option 2 ) is forbidden by the relic density constraints , as we ll show next . condition 3 ) , large cancellations , does naturally occur in msugra models over significant regions of parameter space , including in the body of the cosmologically allowed region with @xmath113 . these cancellations",
    "relax the constraints on the phases , but the limit on @xmath106 remains small , @xmath114 .    to see why option 2 ) is cosmologically forbidden , recall that the susy phases contribute to the electron edm , for example , via processes of the following type :    ( 1,90 ) [ fig : diags ]    where selectrons and sneutrinos appear in the loop .",
    "these contributions diminish as the sfermion masses are increased , but this also shuts off neutralino annihilation in the early universe , which is dominated by sfermion exchange as in fig .  [",
    "fig : ann ] .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath43 then limits the extent to which one can turn off the electron edms by raising the sfermion masses .",
    "the combination of cosmological with edm constraints in the mssm and msugra is discussed in detail in @xcite .    to see the combined limits on @xmath106 and @xmath110 in msugra , we plot in the @xmath115 plane the minimum value of @xmath14 required to bring the edms of both the electron and the mercury atom @xmath116hg below their respective experimental constraints ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m12min ] ) .",
    "these experiments currently provide the tightest bounds on the susy phases . here",
    "we ve fixed @xmath117 , @xmath118 gev and @xmath119 and scanned upwards in @xmath14 until the experimental constraints are satisfied . due to cancellations ,",
    "the edms are not monotonic in @xmath14 ; however , there is still a minimum value of @xmath14 which is allowed .",
    "looking back at fig .",
    "[ fig : noc ] , we see that in the absence of coannihilations , there is an upper bound on @xmath14 of about 450 gev ( though slightly smaller for this @xmath13 ) ; an analogous figure to fig .",
    "[ fig : coan ] for @xmath117 shows that coannihilations increase the bound to about 600 gev . comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig : m12min ] , we see that zone v is cosmologically forbidden , and that the effect of including coannihilations is to allow zone iv , which was formerly excluded .",
    "note in particular that the overall upper bound on @xmath106 in this figure , @xmath120 , is not affected by coannihilations .",
    "this is because the largest @xmath106 occur in regions of cancellations , and these regions happen to lie at lower values of @xmath14 , starting in zone ii with @xmath121 gev .",
    "increasing @xmath122 from 450 to 600 gev is insufficient to bring the individual contributions to the edms to acceptable levels for the larger values of @xmath106 and significant cancellations are still necessary . even taking @xmath14 and @xmath13 at their maximal values from fig .",
    "[ fig : coan ] is not sufficient to reduce the edms below their experimental limits , and so coannihilation _ does not affect _ the upper bound on @xmath106 .",
    "the bowing to the right of the contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : m12min ] is a result of cancellations between different contributions to the edms @xcite , and we can see that the effect is to relax the upper bound on @xmath106 by a factor of a few . as we increase @xmath104 , the extent of the bowing increases , and larger values of @xmath106 can be accessed .",
    "this loophole to larger @xmath106 is limited by the diminishing size of the regions in which there are sufficient cancellations to satisfy the edm constraints .",
    "in general , the regions of cancellation for the electron edm are different than those for the @xmath116hg edm , and the two regions do not always overlap . as @xmath106 is increased , the sizes of the regions of sufficient cancellations decrease ; in fig .  [",
    "fig : m12min ] , the width in @xmath14 of the combined allowed region near the @xmath106 upper bound is 40 - 80 gev , which on a scale of 200 - 300 gev is reasonably broad .",
    "larger @xmath104 permits larger @xmath106 , but the region of cancellations shrinks so that a careful adjustment of @xmath14 becomes required to access the largest @xmath106 . at the end of the day , values of @xmath106 much greater than about @xmath123 can not satisfy the edm constraints without significant fine - tuning of the mass parameters . at larger values of @xmath49 ,",
    "the upper bound decreases roughly as @xmath124 .",
    "see @xcite for more details on the status of edm and cosmological constraints on cp violating phases in msugra .",
    "in summary , constraints on the relic abundance of lsp neutralinos place significant restrictions on the parameter space of the mssm , and msugra in particular . to accurately compute the cosmological upper limits on mssm masses requires the inclusion of coannihilation effects , both for the case of a higgsino and gaugino like neutralino .",
    "in particular , we have found that slepton - neutralino coannihilation greatly affects the neutralino relic abundance when the neutralino and slepton are closely degenerate in mass , as is the case in msugra near where the cosmological upper bound on the neutralino mass is saturated . including coannihilation effects significantly relaxes the cosmological bounds on @xmath125 and @xmath126 , and reduces the combined higgs + cosmology lower bound on @xmath49 , although the upper bounds on cp violating phases in msugra are not relaxed .",
    "the reach of the lhc will be needed to be sensitive the full cosmologically allowed region .",
    "lastly , although i did not discuss it here , similar effects are present for a gaugino like neutralino in the general mssm .     *",
