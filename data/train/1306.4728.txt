    "it is partitioned with the onset temperature , @xmath0 , which is the crossover temperature below which liquid - phase dynamics is spatially heterogeneous .",
    "this temperature is an equilibrium material property .",
    "the pressure dependence of @xmath0 for water has been determined from experimental transport data and computation@xcite .",
    "the low - pressure limit of the onset temperature , @xmath1 , coincides with the temperature of maximum density@xcite . in the phase diagram ,",
    "we express temperature , @xmath2 , in units of @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , we express pressure , @xmath4 , in units of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the molar enthalpy and volume changes upon melting ice at low pressures . with reduced pressure and temperature units ,",
    "the phase diagram is reasonably independent of choice of molecular model@xcite .",
    "requirements for a suitable model are two fold : 1 ) the liquid phase exhibits preference for local tetrahedral order , and 2 ) the liquid freezes into an ice - like crystal with global tetrahedral order .",
    "values of @xmath3 and @xmath8 , specific lattice structures , absolute melting temperatures and so forth are sensitive to specific choices of molecular model , but all have similar liquid - phase dynamics at temperatures below the onset , and all have ice - melting temperatures reasonably close to the onset@xcite . for experimental water , @xmath9k and @xmath10bar .",
    "occurring as it does below the onset temperature , the dynamics of forming ice at supercooled conditions are complex .",
    "for example , in the initial stages of coarsening at low enough temperatures relatively large density fluctuations occur associated with dynamic heterogeneity .",
    "these fluctuations take place over a range of time scales extending to milliseconds@xcite , and when viewed on shorter time scales , they are easily confused with the existence of two distinct liquids . these fluctuations can be arrested and crystallization can be avoided through rapid enough cooling or confinement , producing nonequilibrium amorphous solids of various types with different glass transitions . for instance , when hyperquenching at a cooling rate , @xmath11 , freezing into glass can occur at a temperature @xmath12 , where @xmath13 . here",
    ", @xmath14 stands for the structural relaxation time of the liquid prior to freezing .",
    "because the rate of increase of @xmath14 increases with decreasing @xmath2 , the glass transition temperature , @xmath12 , decreases with decreasing @xmath11 .",
    "of course , a low enough cooling rate leads to crystallization , not glass formation .",
    "importantly , a different @xmath11 and therefore a different @xmath12 can imply a different type of glass .",
    "this is because the transition at @xmath12 produces a material with a frozen nonequilibrium correlation length , @xmath15@xcite .",
    "this length is the mean - free path between excitations at the glass transition .",
    "( `` excitations '' are defined precisely in the next section . ) aging or structural relaxation occurs through coupling excitations , the closer the excitations the more frequent the coupling . in the liquid , @xmath16 , the distribution of lengths between excitations is exponential , like that of an uncorrelated gas of particles .",
    "dynamics in that case takes place hierarchically , with the fastest and slowest time - scales dictated by the domains with smallest and largest @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "by contrast , in the glass , @xmath18 , the distribution of @xmath17 is non - exponential with a dominant and most - probable length , @xmath15 , and there is a single activation energy associated with that dominant length .",
    "as @xmath12 decreases with decreasing cooling rate , @xmath15 grows , and a larger length implies a greater stability of the glass . in particular , the glass formed with a specific @xmath15 can be cooled far below its @xmath12 , and when it is then heated slowly , it looses its stability at an apparent glass transition temperature @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "the difference @xmath21 grows as @xmath15 decreases ( or equivalently , as @xmath11 increases)@xcite .",
    "the distinction between @xmath12 and @xmath19 is important for water precisely because rapid cooling is required to avoid crystallization of that material .",
    "we illustrate the behavior for water in fig .",
    "[ fi : noneqpd]a .",
    "the cooling rate required to produce @xmath22 nm would be @xmath23k / s , and that required to produce @xmath24 nm would be @xmath25k / s .",
    "the former is slightly faster than usually estimated for typical experimental hyperquenching rates , while the latter is somewhat slower than what would be needed to avoid crystallization . to reach",
    "@xmath26 nm would require an even slower @xmath27k / s . a procedure other than straightforward cooling",
    "would be needed to produce amorphous solids of water with @xmath24 or 10 nm .",
    "the dependence of @xmath12 and @xmath19 upon @xmath11 emphasizes that these temperatures are nonequilibrium properties , and their projections onto a @xmath4-@xmath2 plane depend implicitly upon the protocol by which the system is driven from equilibrium .",
    "the distinction between @xmath12 and @xmath19 has been noted by angell@xcite , but without the connection to @xmath15 .",

    "the formulas allow us to interpret phenomena that have been observed experimentally , and they allow us to anticipate phenomena examined later in this paper .    to begin , notice that @xmath12 and @xmath19 are non - monotonic functions of pressure .",
    "this variation reflects the non - monotonic variation of the onset temperature , which in turn reflects a well - known fact about water : at low pressures , transformations of liquid water to more ordered states ( whether to ice or to supercooled liquid ) occur with decreases in density , while at high pressures , they occur with increases in density . a line passing through the locus of minima in @xmath12 partitions the high- and low - pressure regimes in fig .",
    "[ fi : noneqpd]a .",
    "as the local structure of the hda region is necessarily distinct from that of the lda region , there is a possibility of a nonequilibrium transition between the two .",
    "this transition occurs in the vicinity of the line separating the lda and hda regions in fig .",
    "[ fi : noneqpd]a .",
    "indeed , as noted by the circles in that figure , a hda - lda transition is observed experimentally close to that line . the transition can not persist into the liquid because fluctuations in the liquid remove long - lived distinction between the two@xcite .",
