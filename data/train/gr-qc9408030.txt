    "due to the strong nonlinearity of einstein s equations one is tempted to raise the issue of chaos in general relativistic context especially in situations where this nonlinearity is particularly pronounced - for example near a generic gravitational collapse to a space - time singularity .",
    "the property of chaos is usually understood in terms of ( exponential ) divergence in _",
    "`` time '' _ of _ `` nearby orbits '' _ starting from slightly modified initial conditions .",
    "however one faces in the context of general relativity some fundamental problems which make the straightforward application of the machinery developed in the theory of non - linear dynamical systems difficult . at first ,",
    "general relativity , i.e. einstein s theory of gravitation , is not even a dynamical theory in the usual sense .",
    "it does not from the very beginning provide us with a set of parameters ( describing the gravitational degrees of freedom ) evolving in `` time '' .",
    "time looses here its absolute meaning as opposed to the classical dynamical theories where the newtonian time is taken for granted and upon which all our experience in dealing with chaos is based .",
    "the division between space and time in general relativity comes through foliating the space - time manifold @xmath0 into spacelike hypersurfaces",
    "the metric @xmath2 on @xmath0 induces a metric @xmath3 on @xmath1 ( the first fundamental form of @xmath1 ) and can be parametrized in the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are called lapse function and shift vector respectively . only after splitting the space - time into space and time ( the 3 + 1 adm splitting )",
    "@xcite we yield the possibility of mapping the einstein equations to a dynamical system which resembles ordinary hamiltonian dynamical systems . in general this @xmath7 split",
    "is quite an arbitrary procedure and there is a priori _ no preferred time _ coordinate .",
    "the question we shall address in this paper is in particular the following :    _ what is meant by a `` nearby orbit '' in general relativity ?",
    "_    let us suppose that we have performed a @xmath8 split of the spacetime metric into a three - metric `` @xmath9 '' evolving in a time coordinate `` @xmath10 '' .",
    "what is then a natural distance measure @xmath11 between two three - metrics @xmath9 and @xmath12 at some given moment @xmath10 of time ? in the case of non - relativistic hamiltonian dynamical systems , a standard indicator of `` chaos '' such like a principal lyapunov exponent ( cf . , e.g. , discussion in @xcite ) is calculated by using an _",
    "euclidean _ distance measure which is naturally induced from the structure of the kinetic energy term appearing in the non - relativistic hamiltonian . in general relativity",
    "it is , however , not obvious why we should use an euclidean distance measure to assign a distance between two space - time metrics .    in the class of spatially homogeneous spacetime metrics @xmath13 calculations of principal ( maximal )",
    "lyapunov exponents have previously been reported @xcite for the dynamically interesting case of the vacuum mixmaster gravitational collapse .",
    "in fact , the mixmaster toy - model collapse is a useful laboratory to test ideas about how to characterize chaos in general relativity ( see also e.g. discussions in rugh @xcite ) . in the case of the mixmaster metric @xmath14 in ( [ spacetimehomogeneous ] ) denote the @xmath15 invariant one - forms of the mixmaster space @xcite and the three - metric is parametrized by three scale factors @xmath16 , @xmath17 the einstein equations for the mixmaster model are given by three coupled non - linear second order differential equations supplemented by a first integral constraint ( cf .",
    "e.g. landau and lifshitz @xcite ) .",
    "it is tempting to treat the mixmaster collapse like any other dynamical system ( with few degrees of freedom ) , integrate ( numerically ) the 6-dimensional state vector denotes the standard time variable in landau and lifshitz @xcite and a subscript @xmath18 means differentiation with respect to the time variable @xmath18 . ]",
    "@xmath19 and extract `` lyapunov exponents '' in a standard way . in all previous studies @xcite lyapunov exponents were calculated by used an euclidean distance measure ( between two `` nearby '' solutions ) of the form in phase space .",
    "what is equivalent - lyapunov exponents are calculated from the jacobian matrix corresponding to the state vector @xmath20 and integrating up along the orbit .",
    "e.g. hobill @xcite or appendix a in s.e.rugh @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath21 such choice of a distance measure is directly inspired from the study of ordinary ( non - relativistic ) hamiltonian systems .",
    "in general relativity there is however a priori no reason why one should use such a distance measure to give out the distance between @xmath9 and the `` nearby '' three - metric @xmath22 .",
    "this distance measure has been put in artificially in hand and is not supported by the structure of general relativity . a distance measure which is induced by the structure of the ( adm ) hamiltonian formulation of general relativity",
    "is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the so - called `` ( mini)superspace '' metric .",
    "we will here critically examine the idea of using the `` superspace '' metric @xmath25 ( or a conformally rescaled supermetric ) as a distance measure between two three - metrics .",
    "in particular we discuss the idea of extracting an invariant from it like the ricci scalar in order to give invariant ( local ) statements about the divergence of `` nearby '' orbits .",
    "thus , in this paper we examine and extend in various ways the discussion of an approach @xcite - @xcite which has proposed a criterion for instability of the mixmaster gravitational collapse .",
    "szydowski and apeta @xcite , szydowski and biesiada @xcite proposed to look at the ricci scalar of the manifold on which the mixmaster dynamics generates a geodesic flow and investigate if one could extract ( coordinate invariant ) information about instability properties and chaos of the gravitational collapse in this way .",
    "we show in sec.2.2 that for the case of non - relativistic hamiltonian dynamics the instability criterion of negativity of the ricci scalar ( of the manifold on which the dynamics generates a geodesic flow ) is related to a more standard local instability criterion , which examines local instability in terms of the eigenvalues of the jacobian of the hamiltonian flow .",
    "we will stress the nontrivial interplay between local and global instability criteria ( since several authors draw false conclusions from local instability criteria ) .",
    "in particular , we do not believe in expressions directly relating the average negative curvature to lyapunov exponents ( see , e.g. , szydowski and apeta @xcite and szydowski and biesiada @xcite ) .",
    "we note in sec.3 that application of the maupertuis principle to the hamiltonian formulation of the mixmaster dynamics - and the associated induction of a natural distance measure on the three - metrics - is exactly to implement the dream by wheeler , dewitt and others ( described e.g. in @xcite for the mixmaster metric ) to have a superspace metric `` @xmath26 '' ( wheeler s superspace ) - with respect to which the three - metrics move along geodesics - and use this as a natural distance measure on the space of mixmaster three - geometries . in a sense",
    "such a superspace metric would be the most natural to impose on the configuration space of three - geometries ( and appear more natural than introducing a completely arbitrary euclidean metric on the space of three - geometries - as has been done previously in calculating lyapunov exponents for the mixmaster collapse dynamics ) .",
    "thus , the ricci scalar calculated in szydowski and biesiada @xcite from the hamiltonian introduced by bogoyavlenskii @xcite is _ exactly _ to calculate the ricci scalar of wheeler s superspace metric and the criterion @xmath27 imply that we have local instability at least in one direction when we look at the geodesic deviation equation for two nearby mixmaster metrics investigated with wheeler s superspace metric as distance measure .",
    "an obstacle to this approach is the accompanying introduction of a host of singularities of the superspace metric which makes the dream of wheeler troublesome to achieve ( see also discussion in c.w .",
    "misner @xcite ) - even in the restricted class of mixmaster three - geometries .",
    "invariants calculated from the superspace metric , e.g. the ricci scalar , inherit the singularities of the wheeler superspace metric .",
    "in particular , the ricci scalar calculated in szydowski and biesiada @xcite has such singularities .",
    "this obstacle has also most recently been emphasized by burd and tavakol @xcite .",
    "however , as a _ local _ instability criterion , @xmath27 indicates - at nonsingular points where it is defined - the _ local _ exponential instability in some directions of the configuration space .    as a major obstacle",
    ", we emphasize that the distance measure induced by using the wheeler superspace metric is not positive definite .",
    "the situation is somewhat similar to the indefiniteness of the line element in special relativity ( zero distances along the light - cone ) .",
    "but in the case of wheeler s superspace metric in general relativity there is nothing which prevents a trajectory ( a three - metric ) from crossing the null - surface .",
    "thus , one may contemplate situations where a `` zero '' distance ( between two three - metrics which need not be identical ) evolves into a finite ( positive or negative ) distance .",
    "this corresponds formally to a ( local ) `` lyapunov exponent '' which is `` @xmath28 '' .",
    "the investigation is to be viewed in the light of the following question : can one assign an invariant meaning to `` chaos '' in the general relativistic context ?",
    "there is a problem of transferring standard indicators of chaos , e.g. the spectrum of lyapunov exponents , to the general relativistic context , since they are highly gauge dependent objects .",
    "this fact was pointed to and emphasized in rugh @xcite - and was also discussed in pullin @xcite .",
    "( see also more recent discussions in rugh @xcite ) .",
    "one should try to develop indicators of chaos which capture chaotic properties of the gravitational field ( `` metric chaos '' ) in a way which is invariant under spacetime diffeomorphisms - or prove that this can not be done !",
    "it may very well be that there is a `` no go '' theorem , for the most ambitious task of constructing a generalization of a lyapunov exponent ( extracted from the continuous evolution equations ) which is meaningful and invariant under the full class of spacetime diffeomorphisms ( h.b .",
    "nielsen and s.e .",
    "one should therefore , at first , try to modify the intentions and construct instability measures which are invariant under a smaller class of diffeomorphisms , e.g. coordinate transformations on the spacelike hypersurfaces @xmath1 which do not involve transformations of the time coordinate .    `` per time '' indicators - like a lyapunov exponent - have only a little chance of remaining _ invariant _ under diffeomorphisms .",
    "even if we consider the restricted class of lorentz transformations , i.e. space - time transformations within the special theory of relativity , it appears , that the time evolution of a dynamical system is slowed down if we observe it from a frame of reference @xmath29 , which moves ( is boosted ) with some velocity @xmath30 relative to the frame of reference @xmath31 in which the dynamical system is at rest .",
    "hence , the lorentz @xmath32-factor will inevitably appear in the lyapunov exponent ( seen from the moving frame of reference @xmath29 ) .",
    "one notes , however , that we are able to discriminate qualitatively , in any frame of reference , whether or not the dynamical system is chaotic : the requirement that a lyapunov exponent is greater than zero will be valid in any frame of reference if it is valid in one . that is , `` @xmath33 '' is a statement which is _ invariant _ under lorentz - transformations - although the numerical value of the lyapunov exponent @xmath34 is not . in general relativity , however , `` @xmath33 '' is not an invariant statement under diffeomorphisms more general than lorentz - transformations @xcite .",
    "a route of progress may lie in pointing to indicators of purely geometrical nature ( `` fractal dimensions '' , etc ) .",
    "we shall here explore into a picture which is purely geometrical and stems from an old construction known since times of maupertuis and jacobi  namely that in which hamiltonian dynamical systems are mapped into geodesic flows . in this approach",
    "the entire complicated dynamics comes out from purely geometrical properties of a single `` object ''  the manifold on which the geodesic flow is generated .",
    "one may consequently dream that also such basic properties like integrability or chaos may be somehow captured in purely geometrical ( and hence timeless and invariant ) terms .",
    "for example one may hope to describe local instability of trajectories in terms of curvature invariants ( e.g. the ricci scalar ) since it is curvature that determines the behavior of close geodesics ( through the geodesic deviation equation ) .",
    "we shall however also point out several obstructions one has to face when implementing such a line of thinking to general relativistic problems .",
    "it is indeed a remarkable fact that a large class of hamiltonian systems can be presented in such a way that hamilton s equations acquire formal resemblance to geodesic equations in riemannian geometry .",
    "the phase space trajectories @xmath35 with respect to time parameter @xmath10 and corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath36 may be mapped into a geodesic motion on the configuration space manifold .",
    "it is accomplished in a way which displays a complete analogy with the mapping of the evolution of three - metrics into that of geodesic motion in wheeler s superspace ( see next section ) .",
    "the equations of motion for the @xmath37 coordinates may be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the christoffel symbol calculated with respect to @xmath40 metric . due to the force term",
    "this is , obviously , not a geodesic equation .",
    "it is simply the newton s second law restated .",
    "the momentum variables are just linear combinations of velocities @xmath41 .",
    "transformation to a geodesic motion ( i.e. free motion in a curved space ) is accomplished in two steps : @xmath42 conformal transformation of the metric @xmath40 , and @xmath43 change of the time parameter along the orbit .",
    "in fact only the first step is crucial the second one merely introduces the affine parameter along the geodesics .",
    "more explicitly we equip the configuration space with the ( super)metric @xmath44 ( note that @xmath40 is read off from the kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian and ( in general ) is allowed to vary as a function of the configuration space variable , @xmath45 ) . + with respect to the metric ( [ supermetricmaupertius ] ) and the time parameter @xmath10 it is not easy to see that the orbits are geodesics since there is a term appearing on the right hand side of the equation , @xmath46 where @xmath47 now denote the christoffel symbols associated with the ( super)metric ( [ supermetricmaupertius ] ) .",
    "however , if we ( re)parametrize the orbit @xmath48 in terms of the parameter @xmath49 defined via @xmath50 the orbits will become affinely parametrized geodesics parameter ) reads @xmath51 ( prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath30 ) where @xmath52 is an arbitrary function of @xmath30 . then by solving the differential equation @xmath53 one can construct a new parameter  the so called affine parameter @xmath49 such that @xmath54 ( overdot here denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath49 ) .",
    "it is evident that this new parameter is defined up to linear transformations @xmath55",
    "( @xmath56 are constants ) what justifies its name . ] , i.e. the configuration space variables @xmath57 satisfy the well known geodesic equation @xmath58 with no force term on the right hand side .",
    "there is no `` magic '' in this , it is merely a rewriting of the hamiltonian equations .",
    "the information about the original force acting on the particle ( as described by the potential @xmath59 in the hamiltonian ( [ originalhamiltonian ] ) ) has been encoded entirely in the definition of the ( super)metric ( [ supermetricmaupertius ] ) and the definition of the new parameter @xmath49 in ( [ parametermaupertius ] ) parametrizing the orbit . ] and its formal resemblance to the variational formulation of geodesics in riemannian geometry as curves extremalizing the distance .",
    "we have sketched the step - by - step derivation of the geodesic motion in order to see the step - by - step analogy with the derivation of three - metrics as geodesics in wheeler s superspace in the next section . ]",
    "the entire procedure involves the following principal steps :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * 1 .",
    "* at first a metric @xmath40 is read off from structure of kinetic term in the hamiltonian . +",
    "we observe that the trajectory @xmath60 is not a geodesic with respect to this metric . +",
    "transformation of the non - geodesic motion to affinely parametrized geodesic motion is obtained via two steps : + * ( 1 ) * conformal transformation of the metric @xmath61 + * ( 2 ) * rescaling of the time parameter @xmath62 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    it is , however , not often that this description is used in the discussion of hamiltonian dynamical systems , for example in the discussion of instability properties and chaotic behavior of such systems .",

    "we repeat them here to comment on what one may conclude ( or not conclude ) from local criteria of instability like @xmath156 there has been some confusion concerning this point in the past .",

    "as already noticed in the introduction there were attempts @xcite to relate the @xmath69 criterion with lyapunov exponents .",
    "in particular it was argued that the quantity @xmath157 played a role of the principal lyapunov exponent .",
    "the ricci scalar @xmath68 is meant here as an average measure of local divergence of trajectories .",
    "the motivation of such claims ( see @xcite ) had its roots in the following facts : if we take the geodesic deviation equation ( [ geodesicdeviationmaupertius ] ) and rewrite it as a gradient system ( see appendix 1 in arnold @xcite ) , i.e. @xmath158 = -{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$ } } } _ { \\xi}(\\frac{1}{2 } r_{ijkl } \\xi^i u^j \\xi^k u^l ) = - { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$ } } } _ { \\xi } \\ ; [ \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2 } k_{u;\\xi } g(\\xi,\\xi)]\\ ] ] where the `` potential '' @xmath159 has been expressed by sectional curvature : @xmath160 .",
    "then by averaging the geodesic deviation equation over the orientation of the geodesic ( i.e. at a given point we take all possible geodesics passing through this point , average over the bivector @xmath161 and denote this average by @xmath162 ) one arrives at the formula @xcite : @xmath163 from which one may argue for the quantity ( [ rlyap ] ) bearing in mind that the @xmath49-parameter is related to the @xmath10-time by ( [ parametermaupertius ] ) .",
    "the reasoning is flawed , however , in several aspects .",
    "one can not replace the integration of a full jacobian matrix , cf .",
    "equation ( [ jexponentiated ] ) , with the integration of a ricci - scalar which is just some average quantity ( trace over the sectional curvatures ) .",
    "the negativity of the ricci scalar , @xmath69 , which is an initial assumption for ( [ rlyap ] ) to apply is only a sufficient criterion of local instability .",
    "hence in the case of the hamiltonian ( [ xyharmonic ] ) , for example , we have @xmath164 whereas the lyapunov exponent @xmath33 for most trajectories .",
    "then apart from the fact that local instability can not be simply translated into global chaos also the meaning of `` averaged deviation equation '' is questionable . even if the ricci scalar @xmath68 is traced ( numerically ) along trajectories one may give examples of systems with positive kolmogorov entropy ( understood , here , as the sum over positive lyapunov exponents ) for which the quantity ( [ rmaupertius ] ) is either positive or negative ( see e.g. discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the above critique apply to some earlier papers @xcite and also to burd and tavakol who adopted the expression ( [ rlyap ] ) in @xcite .",
    "we would also like to question the validity of the formula ( 38 ) in gurzadyan and savvidy @xcite in which the ricci scalar is related to a relaxation time of the dynamical system consisting of collisionless stars interacting via gravitational forces .    in order not to close this section in too pessimistic mood",

    "machine precision_. ( such an adjustment is indeed necessary .",
    "discussions in s.e .",
    "rugh @xcite and d. hobill @xcite ) .",
    "this yields the starting conditions @xmath264 on the figure the minisuperspace ricci scalar is displayed . for comparison",
    "also the evolution of ( logarithmic ) scale factors @xmath265 is superimposed .",
    "it turns out that @xmath68 is negative all the time but varies over many orders of magnitude .",
    "the latter is connected with the singularities generated by a vanishing conformal factor at points where the potential is zero . at these points @xmath68",
    "goes to ( minus ) infinity and a numerical cure against it was to provide an arbitrary cut off .",
    "this means that our trial trajectory of the mixmaster collapse stays in the regions of minisuperspace where `` local instability '' occurs .",
    "of course such an illustration can not be representative for any larger set of trajectories .",
    "for example , the minisuperspace ricci scalar calculated along a taub axisymmetric solution was found to be positive . however , even in cases when @xmath69 it is not possible to claim , cf . our previous discussion about local and global properties , that this fact accounts for global chaotic behavior - even though some may be tempted to make such an inference .",
    "the possibility of mapping the dynamics of a wide class of hamiltonian systems to geodesic flows on riemannian manifolds by application of maupertuis principle , and extracting coordinate invariant information about local instability of the trajectories ( from the corresponding riemann tensor ) has been applied in various contexts , ranging from n - body systems ( a gas ) interacting via van der waals forces ( krylov @xcite ) , the instability ( relaxation ) properties of a collisionless gas interacting via gravitational forces ( gurzadyan and savvidy @xcite ) and n - body systems interacting via the debye - hckel potential given by @xmath266 ( a model for a hot dilute plasma , van velsen @xcite ) .    in this paper we have examined virtues and drawbacks of applying this idea to general relativity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "coordinate invariant information about local instability properties is in this case - as in the applications to the aforementioned non - relativistic hamiltonian systems - imagined to be extracted either from negativity of the ricci scalar ( which is the sum over principal sectional curvatures ) or by considering the ( principal ) sectional curvatures themselves @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the maupertuis principle as a way of geometrizing the hamiltonian dynamics when implemented to general relativity is actually reproducing wheeler s idea of a superspace in which three - geometries evolve along geodesic lines .",
    "we have examined this superspace in order to get an insight into the construction of gauge invariant ( geometrical ) criteria for local instability in general relativity .",
    "the original dream of having einstein s equations acting as a geodesic flow has been abandoned by its inventors a long time ago because of artificial singularities created by the conformal rescaling of the metric in points where the adm potential equals zero . in",
    "so far as for its original purpose i.e. to provide a suitable state - space for quantization of gravity , people could ( and actually did ) retreat to more secure ground of the weaker form of the superspace ( giving up the geodesic picture ) the _ conformally rescaled _",
    "superspace is crucial for our proposal .",
    "the idea is simple : if one can cast the dynamics into a geodesic flow then the sensitive dependence on initial conditions ( a key ingredient of instability and chaos ) may be captured at the level of jacobi equation for geodesic deviation .",
    "the original intention was to point to a certain reasonable approach rather than provide an ultimate solution ( if any exist ) to the problem of invariant description of chaos .",
    "we have noticed some obvious dangers when one makes global conclusions from local considerations .",
    "this issue is far from being trivial however , since the history of differential geometry teaches that starting from gauss _ theorema egregium _",
    "a lot of effort ( sometimes spectacularly successful ) has been paid to the question of how to derive global characteristics from local ones .",
    "we have shown that expressions - used previously - such like ( [ rlyap ] ) relating directly the ricci scalar with lyapunov exponents @xcite are not true . therefore , unfortunately , one can not base a short time average ( sta ) lyapunov exponent on this expression either , cf .",
    "burd and tavakol @xcite",
    ". the sta approach @xcite as a tool for studying non - uniform dynamics is based on evaluation of the lyapunov exponents ( extracted in a standard way from the jacobian ) over a finite time interval .",
    "the mixmaster toy - model gravitational collapse examined here as an example of a spacetime metric with complex ( chaotic ) behavior is in fact rather well understood  the bkl - description @xcite is derived under assumptions which are very good and indeed numerically confirmed in rugh @xcite and by berger @xcite . nevertheless ,",
    "if we want to characterize - or rather to develop measures of - chaos in the highly non - linear einstein equations , the mixmaster collapse is a suitable toy - model laboratory to address such questions : if we are not even able to invent useful indicators of chaos in the moderately simple example of the mixmaster space - time metric , how are we ever going to be able to deal with these issues for more general and more complicated space - time metrics ?    the observation of gauge variance of standard indicators like that of a lyapunov exponent in the context of general relativity was emphasized by rugh @xcite and also by pullin @xcite .",
    "( see also recent discussion in rugh @xcite ) .",
    "if we apply standard techniques of extracting the lyapunov exponents we at first sight have chaos in some gauges and in other gauges there seems to be no chaos .",
    "apparently , this situation arises because we are looking at the problem in the wrong way - we have not posed a `` gauge invariant question '' !    whereas rugh @xcite was expressing hope of constructing indicators which are invariant under a large class of coordinate transformations , i.e. indicators which do not refer to a `` particular gauge '' ( a problem which is easier to point out than to solve ) it appears that pullin @xcite was resorting to the poincar disc as a kind of `` selected set of coordinates ''  a similar viewpoint is shared by misner @xcite .",
    "it appears to us that no `` gauge '' is better than others ( is chaos in general relativity a concept which should only be defined in certain selected frames of coordinates ? ) - yet some gauges may make things particularly simple or elegant thereby expressing the explicit or hidden symmetry ( geometric structure ) of the problem . the geometric approach ( via maupertuis principle ) discussed in the present paper also points toward a certain structure uncovered from the hamiltonian formulation of general relativity ( which turned out to be equivalent to wheeler s superspace ) as a `` natural '' one .",
    "the problem is however not with `` preferred '' gauges but rather whether the criteria used to establish certain properties ( such like chaoticity ) are gauge - invariant themselves .",
    "therefore we ought to seek measures of chaos ( if they are possible to construct ) which are invariant under some large class of gauge transformations .    here",
    "we have examined an approach which points to a more gauge invariant construction involving wheeler s superpace .",
    "however , this approach does ( also ) have several obstacles , e.g. when implemented in the toy - model context of the mixmaster gravitational collapse .",
    "hence it is safe to conclude that how to characterize chaos most elegantly in general relativity ( even in the context of simple toy - models ) remains an open question .",
