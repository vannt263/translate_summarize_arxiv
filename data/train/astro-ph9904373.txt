    "the study of the gev - tev component of gamma - ray bursts is of great importance to understand the acceleration mechanisms and the sources physical conditions .",
    "the detection of gev gamma - rays by egret during some intense grbs @xcite suggests the possibility that a high energy component could be present in all events .",
    "furthermore several models predict gev and tev emission , sometimes correlated with uhecrs production ( see @xcite , for a review ) . due to the low fluxes and the small sensitive areas of satellite experiments , gamma - rays of energy larger than a few tens of gev ,",
    "must be detected by ground based experiments located at mountain altitude measuring the secondary particles generated by gamma - rays in the atmosphere . at energies",
    "e  @xmath3  10  tev the number of particles reaching the ground is to small to reconstruct the shower parameters using a standard air shower array , made of several detectors spread over large areas . on the contrary , a detector consisting of a full coverage layer of counters , providing a high granularity sampling of all particle showers , can succesfully measure arrival direction and primary energy of small showers , allowing the study of the unexplored range of gamma energies between 20 gev and 300 gev @xcite .",
    "argo - ybj is an air shower detector optimized to observe small size showers , to be constructed in the yangbajing laboratory ( tibet , china ) at an altitude of 4300 m a.s.l .",
    "the experiment consists of a @xmath0 71@xmath474 m@xmath1 core detector realised with a single layer of rpc s ( @xmath5 of active area ) , surrounded by an outer detector ( @xmath6 of active area ) for a total size of @xmath0 100@xmath4100 m@xmath1 .",
    "a lead converter 0.5 cm thick will cover uniformly the rpc plane in order to increase the number of charged particles by conversion of shower photons in @xmath7 and to reduce the time spread of the shower front @xcite .",
    "argo - ybj can image with high efficiency and sensitivity atmospheric showers initiated by primaries of energies in the range 10  gev@xmath2  500  tev .",
    "its main physics goals are @xcite : gamma - astronomy at @xmath0  100  gev energy threshold , with a sensitivity to detect unidentified point sources of intensity as low as @xmath8 of the crab nebula ; gamma - ray burst physics , extending the satellite measurements at energies e @xmath9 10 gev ; @xmath10 ratio in the tev energy range ; sun and heliosphere physics .",
    "the detector assembling should start in 2000 and data taking with the first @xmath11 @xmath12 of rpc s in 2001 .",
    "a high energy grb is detectable if the number of air showers from the gamma - rays is significant larger than the fluctuations of the background , due to showers from cosmic rays with arrival directions compatible with the burst position .",
    "a good angular resolution is of major importance in order to reduce the background and increase the detection sensitivity .",
    "the angular resolution and the effective area of argo - ybj to detect gamma - rays as a function of the energy have been obtained by means of simulations . for gamma - rays with energy as low as e @xmath0 10 - 20 gev , the opening angle around the source direction in which 70@xmath13 of the signal showers are contained",
    "is @xmath0 5@xmath14 .",
    "to evaluate the sensitivity of argo - ybj to detect grbs , we considered a burst with a power law energy spectrum @xmath15 extending in the range 1  gev  @xmath16 , a duration @xmath17=1 s , and a zenith angle @xmath18=20@xmath14 .",
    "the burst will give a signal with a significance larger than 4 standard deviations if the energy fluence in the range 1  gev  @xmath16 is larger than a minimum value f@xmath19 .",
    "fig.1 shows f@xmath19 as a function of @xmath20 for 3 spectral slopes . for a generic duration @xmath17",
    "the minimum fluences detectable are given by @xmath21 .",
    "in the energy range considered the sensitivity is strongly dependent on the maximum energy of the spectrum @xmath20 .",
    "argo - ybj can observe grbs with energy fluences of a few 10@xmath22 erg @xmath23 if the energy spectrum extends at least up to @xmath0  200  gev with a slope @xmath242 ; the minimum detectable fluence is @xmath0 10@xmath25 if @xmath26  30  gev .",
    "this is of particular importance , since if grb sources are located at cosmological distances , the high energy tail of the spectrum is affected by the @xmath27 interaction of gamma - rays with low energy starlight photons in the intergalactic space .",
    "according to @xcite , at a distance corresponding to a redshift @xmath28=0.1 the absorption is almost negligible , while at @xmath28=0.5 ( 1.0 ) the absorption becomes important for photons of energy e  @xmath9  100  ( 50 )  gev .",
    "these values give an idea of the possible maximum energy of the grbs spectra as a function of their distance , and from fig.1 one can infer the maximum sensitivity of argo - ybj to detect cosmological grbs .",
    "the minimum observable fluences can be compared with the fluences measured by egret in the 1 mev-1 gev energy range : @xmath29 erg @xmath23 @xcite . since",
    "egret spectral slopes @xmath30 are mostly @xmath0 2 , one could expect fluences of the same order of magnitude at energies above 1 gev . from fig.1",
    "one can conclude that argo - ybj could detect grbs with the same intensity of those observed by egret provided that the energy spectrum extends up to few tens of gevs ; the sensitivity increases by a factor @xmath010 for spectra extending up to @xmath31  200  gev .",
