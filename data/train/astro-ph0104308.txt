    "studies of dla absorbers have provided hints on the properties of structure at high redshift , from both kinematical and chemical points of view ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; haehnelt , steinmetz & rauch 1998 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of the absorbers at low @xmath3 show that these systems have diverse morphologies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) while at high @xmath3 their nature remains unclear .",
    "first kinematical studies suggested that high redshift dlas were large disks similar to those in present - day spiral galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , haehnelt et al . ( 1998 ) show that they are also consistent with being the building blocks of local typical galaxies , as predicted by hierarchical clustering scenarios ( hcss ) .",
    "the metallicity properties of dlas support the idea that they are chemically young objects ( e.g. , @xcite , prochaska et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , the dependence of their metallicities on @xmath3 is a controversial point since , until recently , only very weak or non - evolution at all has been reported from the analysis of the mean metallicity of the neutral hydrogen with the abundance ratios weighted by the hi column density ( @xmath4 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) in contrast with some theoretical models which predict substantial evolution of the neutral hydrogen abundances ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; see cen & ostriker 1999 for a different result ) .",
    "however , the unweighted mean metallicities and linear regressions through the individual data show stronger evolution signals as reported in recent works ( i.e. , @xcite ; vladilo et al .",
    "2000 ; hou et al . 2001 ) .",
    "detecting evolution in chemical abundances of hi gas mass may be difficult due to several biasing factors . among them , dust depletion and obscuration have been probed to be a source of uncertainties for some element measurements ( e.g. , vladilo 1998 ; @xcite ) , while the limited redshift coverage with the known dlas may not be adequate for detecting the presence of evolution . as first pointed out by boiss et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , dlas with high @xmath5 and high metallicity might be missing from the data as a consequence of dust extinction which would imply a biased determination of evolution .",
    "for the @xmath6elements , dust - corrected data show mild enhancement or near solar values for most observed elements in contrast to the metallicity pattern of metal - poor galactic stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this might imply a different sf history than that of the milky way , although prochaska et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found an agreement between the properties of the galactic thick disk and the dlas .",
    "in hcss , where galaxies are formed by aggregation of smaller substructures , mergers and continuous gas infall play an important role , contributing to regulate the star formation ( sf ; @xcite ) and chemical histories ( e.g. , @xcite ) of the galactic objects .",
    "as suggested by haehnelt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) from a kinematical study of numerical simulations , dlas could be the progenitor substructures of today galaxies that merge to form galactic objects in a hierarchical clustering scenario .",
    "the variety of morphological types together with the fact that they tend to be chemically young seem to support this hypothesis . with the aim at understanding the possible link between the structure in a hcs and the nature of dlas , in this letter",
    ", we assess the chemical properties of today - galaxy building blocks as a function of the redshift . for this purpose , we focus our study on the analysis of the unweighted mean metallicities of the neutral hydrogen as a function of @xmath3 since they are more sensitive to the properties of the individual objects",
    ". we also comment on the mass - weighted mean metallicities that are related to the chemical content of the universe .",
    "we use hydrodynamical cosmological models that treat the non - linear evolution of both baryons and dark matter in a self - consistent way , providing a well - described history of formation , and include star formation and chemical evolution .",
    "results of the simulations are compared with available observational data on chemical abundances of dlas .",
    "we discuss implications for galaxy formation .",
    "our hydrodynamical chemical simulations follow the joint evolution of the dark matter and baryons within a cosmological context ( @xcite ) including sf and chemical evolution .",
    "stars are formed from cold and dense gas in a convergent flow according to the schmidt law .",
    "gaseous particles are gradually transformed into stars in different sf episodes .",
    "the contribution of type i ( sni ) and type ii ( snii ) supernovas from each of these sf episodes to the chemical enrichment of the gas component are taken into account according to stellar evolution models and metallicity enrichment yields .",
    "chemical elements generated in a given particle are distributed among gas particles within its neighboring area , weighting each contribution with a kernel function that depends on the distance ( i.e. , by using the smooth particle hydrodynamics technique ) .",
    "we adopt the yields given by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) for snii and those given by thielemann , nomoto & hashimoto ( 1993 ) for sni . a time delay of @xmath7 yrs is assumed for binary star systems to explode as sni .",
    "we adopt a fixed salpeter initial mass function with lower and upper mass cut - offs of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . in this work the effects of energy injection into the interstellar medium due to supernova explosions have not been included . for a detailed discussion of the chemical model see mosconi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "we analyze cosmological simulations of a typical 10 mpc cube volume represented by @xmath10 equal mass particles ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "initial conditions are consistent with a standard cold dark matter universe ( @xmath12 ) with cluster abundance normalization , @xmath13 .",
    "we have run a set of three simulations with different realizations of the power spectrum , estimating averaged results over them .",
    "the sn parameters adopted in these simulations correspond to those giving the best agreement with observations of galaxies at @xmath14 ( @xcite ) and the [ o / fe ] abundance pattern in the milky way ( @xcite ) .",
    "we identified galactic objects at their virial radius at different stages of evolution of the simulated volume .",
    "galactic objects are formed by a dark matter halo and a baryonic component in the form of gas and stars . to diminish numerical resolution problems ,",
    "we analyze galactic objects with more than 200 baryonic particles within their virial radius and in the range @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , the analyzed objects have virial velocities within @xmath16 .",
    "we study a total number of 380 galactic objects satisfying the above conditions which are all considered as possible absorbers .",
    "it is likely that dlas observations map the chemical properties of the gaseous disks not expected to be good tracers of the metal content at the central regions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "hence , in order to carry out a suitable comparison between the simulated galactic objects and dlas observations , we use a monte carlo technique to simulate line - of - sights ( los ) and estimate the chemical properties of the neutral hydrogen component with @xmath17 ( @xcite ) along the los .",
    "we assume that the hydrogen mass in a gas particle remains neutral if no sf activity has ever occured within that particle .    as a combined result of dynamical evolution ,",
    "mergers and interactions , the sf rate history of each galactic object can be described as a contribution of an ambient sf rate and a series of starbursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the timings between starbursts are not ad hoc , but given naturally by the evolution of the objects in the hcs adopted .",
    "thus , we have a consistent description of the chemical enrichment of the stellar populations and gaseous component due to the fact that the different ejecta times of sni and snii can be properly taken into account .",
    "note that the simulated sample is not affected by dust depletion or obscuration .",
    "these facts make our simulations powerful tools to explore the nature of dlas .    for each galactic object selected at a given redshift",
    "we define the hi mass - weighted mean of abundance ratio of elements k and j , [ k / j ] in the column of hi along a los , as :    @xmath18={\\rm log } \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^ { n_{\\rm p } } { \\rm k}_i \\ ,   m^{\\rm gas}_i } { \\sum_{i=1}^ { n_{\\rm p } } { \\rm j}_i \\ ,   m^{\\rm gas}_i } - { \\rm log}({\\rm k / j})_{\\odot},\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the total number of gas particles belonging to a galactic object along a certain los , @xmath20 the neutral hydrogen mass of the @xmath21 particle , @xmath22 and @xmath23 their chemical abundances , and @xmath24 the corresponding solar abundance ratio .",
    "similarly , we can define the mean abundance ratios for the stellar populations .",
    "this point will be discussed in a separate paper .    in order to study the metallicity evolution of dlas ,",
    "we consider the abundance ratios of [ zn / h ] and [ fe / h ] . in our sample",
    "both elements can be measured without introducing biases such as those produced by dust extinction and depletion , or , in the case of zinc by the fact that this element is difficult to detect at low metallicities .",
    "note that the zinc is usually considered a reliable tracer of metallicity because it is weakly depleted onto dust grains , however , its nucleosynthesis remains to be fully understood ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "current models for the production of this element ( @xcite ) have problem in reproducing the observational fact that , regardless of metallicity , stars in the halo and thin disk of the galaxy have nearly solar [ zn / fe ] values ( see also hou et al .",
    "nevertheless , recent results suggest that zn is enhanced relative to fe in the stars of the galactic thick disk ( @xcite ) these make results from zn analysis more difficult to interpret . for the purpose of carrying out a reliable comparison between observations and simulations",
    ", we gathered the available observations from the literature ( see figure 1 ) and estimated the same parameters calculated for the simulations within the same redshift range .    in figure 1a , we show the unweighted mean @xmath25 > } = 1/n \\sum_n{\\rm [ zn / h]}$ ] ratios ( where @xmath26 is the number of galactic objects in the total simulated sample that are located at a certain @xmath3 ) for the hi component along the los of galactic objects in the three simulations as a function of redshift .",
    "error bars correspond to the dispersion of the ratios of the galactic objects at each analyzed @xmath3 .",
    "as it can be seen , the simulated neutral gas abundance ratios are within the observed range for dlas . in order to quantify their evolution with @xmath3 ,",
    "we compute the unweighted mean @xmath25>}$ ] in two redshift intervals , @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "we obtain @xmath25_{low}>}= -0.53 \\pm 0.06 $ ] and @xmath25_{inter}>}= -1.12 \\pm 0.17 $ ] .",
    "these results imply an evolution of @xmath29 dex between the low and intermediate redshift bins in the models , while dlas observations show a variation of @xmath30 for the same redshift bins .",
    "the observed mean values are @xmath25_{low}>}= -0.89 \\pm 0.10 $ ] and @xmath25_{inter}>}= -1.11 \\pm 0.07 $ ] .",
    "hence , at high @xmath3 the simulated and observational values agree very well . however , the low-@xmath3 values differ in @xmath31 dex .",
    "this difference in the lower @xmath3 interval could be attributed to the observational bias first discussed by boiss et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that would prevent high @xmath4 systems with high metallicities to be detected ( see also @xcite ; savaglio 2000 ) . by analyzing the chemical properties of the individual dlas , vladilo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found an anticorrelation signal for the [ zn / h ] data which yields a linear regression with a slope of @xmath32 , detecting intrinsic evolution for @xmath33 .",
    "a similar analysis applied to our set of observational data within our @xmath3-range yields @xmath34 .",
    "for the simulated dlas , we obtained a slope of @xmath35 which , albeit larger , is statistically consistent with observations .",
    "figure 1b shows the unweighted @xmath36>}$ ] versus @xmath3 for the same galactic objects plotted in figure 1a .",
    "this element suffers strong gas depletion but can be observed over a larger @xmath3 interval , its nucleosynthesis is better understood and can be easily detected at low metallicities .",
    "> from figure1b we see that the estimated ratios for the hi along the los in the simulations match the observational range of dlas .",
    "estimates of their unweighted @xmath36>}$ ] at @xmath37 and @xmath38 give a 0.67 @xmath39 0.13 dex evolution in the simulations .",
    "calculations for the available dlas observations in the range @xmath40 show , in this case , a signal for evolution of @xmath41 dex . a linear regression through the observed [ fe / h ] data within the same @xmath3-range shows a slope of @xmath42 ( see also savaglio 2000 ;",
    "hou et al .",
    "the linear correlation of the simulated [ fe / h ] ratios gives @xmath43 .",
    "all these values are in suitable agreement within the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the mass - weighted mean metallicities of hi assess the evolution of the chemical properties of the population as a whole and , consequently , of the chemical history of the universe .",
    "as previously reported , both the observed @xmath4-weighted mean [ zn / h ] and [ fe / h ] ratios show mild or no evolution for @xmath44 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , while most theoretical models predict substantial change of the metallicity of neutral gas with redshift .",
    "estimates of the corresponding ratios in our model at low and intermediate @xmath3 intervals also yield a signal of evolution : @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the [ zn / h ] and [ fe / h ] , respectively .",
    "we would like to stress that the conclusions about the evolution of the observed [ zn / h ] and [ fe / h ] by using mean values at low and intermediate @xmath3 should be taken with caution because of the small number statistics in the low @xmath3-bin .",
    "more observations of dlas at low @xmath3 are needed to draw final conclusion on this point .",
    "but , mainly , more observations of dlas with high @xmath5 and high metallicity are required to properly assess the presence of evolution .",
    "in fact , if dlas with these characteristics were missing from the data then the presence of evolution could be difficult to detect . in order to mimic this effect , prantzos & boissier ( 2000 ) applied a filter to their model by selecting the dlas according to the observationally determined constraint @xmath47 + log } n_{\\rm hi } < 21 $ ] .",
    "following their work , we estimate the evolution of the filtered simulated dlas , using the [ zn / h ] ratios . for the unweighted means we obtained an evolution signal of @xmath48 while the weighted ratios show a weaker change consistent with mild evolution : @xmath49 .",
    "clearly , selection biases could have strong implications when estimating changes with redshift .",
    "the standard dispersions shown in figure 1 for both elements in the simulated sample reproduce fairly well the observed dispersions of dlas : for the [ zn / h ] the building blocks show a dispersion of @xmath50 and @xmath51 while observations have @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the simulated [ fe / h ] ratios have @xmath54 and @xmath55 compared to the observed ones of @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in our models",
    "this dispersion arises as the results of the variety of galactic objects with diverse evolutionary histories : merger tree , star formation , chemical enrichment , etc .",
    ", at different @xmath3 , supporting a similar origin for the large dispersion observed in dlas .",
    "we estimate the unweighted mean [ si / fe ] and [ s / fe ] ratios in order to analyze the behavior of the @xmath1-elements in the hi gas mass of the simulated galactic objects .",
    "> from figure 2a we can appreciate that the mean [ si / fe ] ratios have nearly solar values and show no dependence on metallicity , consistent with the dust - corrected observations reported by vladilo ( 1998 ) and pettini et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who assumed that zn is undepleted and traces fe .",
    "a similar behavior was found for mean [ s / fe ] ratios .    in figure 2b",
    "we show the unweighted @xmath58>}$ ] abundances versus @xmath36>}$ ] .",
    "we find that the hi component of the simulated dlas tend to exhibit [ zn / fe ] values around a mean of @xmath59 ( 1@xmath60 deviation ) .",
    "it should be noted that these values are consistent with the observed range for dlas with no dust corrections ( with a mean of @xmath61 ) while dust - corrected ratios show nearly solar values . as more extensively discussed by prantzos & boissier ( 2000",
    "; see also @xcite and @xcite ) current nucleosynthesis models of the zinc have problem in reproducing the observed abundance pattern of the milky - way . if we had assumed that zn traces fe for all metallicites ( e.g. , @xcite ) , our models would have produced mean ratios in agreement with those of vladilo ( 1998 ) corrected by dust - depletion .",
    "observational studies of the chemical properties of dlas have provided unvaluable information on galaxy evolution up to @xmath62 .",
    "this letter aims to provide a theoretical frame to understand these observations within hcss .",
    "the chemical hydrodynamical cosmological models analyzed take into account different physical mechanisms controlling the formation and evolution of galaxies : gravitational collapse , tidal torques , mergers , interactions , gas infall , gradient pressure , radiative cooling , sf and chemical enrichment by sni and snii explosions . in this scenario",
    "we follow the formation and evolution of galaxy - like objects , analyzing the chemical properties of the different substructures that merge hierarchically .    in order to properly compare the galactic objects in the simulations with the observed dlas , we estimated the abundances of hi along los randomly distributed .",
    "we found that the simulated galactic objects have gaseous components that , when randomly sampled , have [ zn / h ] and [ fe / h ] abundances within the observed range for dlas . in the simulations ,",
    "the unweighted [ zn / h ] and [ fe / h ] ratios show evolution with @xmath3 in statistical agreement with results obtained from similar analysis of the available observations ( see also vladilo et al .",
    "2000 ; @xcite ; hou et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , the mass - weighted metallicities of the simulated and observed @xmath63 show opposite trends ; while the former show evolution , the later do not",
    ". part of this discrepancy can be attributed to observational biases that might prevent low - density metal - poor and very metal - rich and dense zones to be detected by current observations .",
    "in fact , taking into account these effects by applying a filter to the simulated [ zn / h ] , we found , on one hand , that the unweighted means still show a clear evolution , and , on the other , that the filtered weighted abundances yield a weaker dependence with @xmath3 in agreement with corresponding observations ( e.g. , pettini et al . 1999 ) .",
    "accordingly to our results , this observational bias seems to affect more strongly the weighted means suggesting that the interpretation of the evolution of the chemical content of the universe by using dlas should be taken with extra caution .",
    "more observations , principally of high density and high metallicity hi column densities , are needed to draw a final conclusion .",
    "the lack of @xmath6enhancements in the _ mean _ abundances of simulated galactic objects shows that , in the redshift range analyzed , there are already significant contributions from both types of sns , so that the mean unweighted metallicities of the @xmath4 are nearly solar , in agreement with dlas observations after dust corrections .",
    "we detect no evolution of [ @xmath1/fe ] with metallicity implying that , for our galactic objects , their sf histories are the result of the superposition of different starbursts occuring at different epochs .",
    "moreover , the starbursts could have been triggered in different substructures that merge to form the galactic objects analyzed at a given z. in the case of zn we found enhancement with respect to the fe but no dependence on metallicity . a lower zn nucleosynthesis production in the models ( or assuming that zn traces fe ) would have produced [ zn / fe ] values in agreement with the dust - corrected observed dlas ( @xcite ) .",
    "this lower zn production does not affect the agreement found between the observed and simulated [ zn / h ] at low @xmath3 shown in figure 1a . at high z , models and observations",
    "can be reconciled if one takes into account that several high @xmath3 estimations of [ zn / h ] in observed dlas are upper limits instead of accurate values .",
    "the zinc remains a controversial element as pointed out by several authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) whose production and evolution are not fully understood .    to sum up ,",
    "the chemical properties of galactic objects in our models at a given z are the result of their past evolution : collapse , mergers , interactions , sf history , etc .",
    "since we do not impose any particular constraint to select the galactic objects in the models , the results of our chemical analysis seem to support that dlas could be the building blocks of today normal galaxies within a hierarchical context .",
