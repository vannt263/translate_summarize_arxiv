    "star clusters which have survived for several ( @xmath4 ) billion years ( intermediate - age clusters ) can provide important clues concerning both the evolution history of their parent galaxies and for understanding the destruction processes which erode star cluster systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in the galaxy , clusters of this age",
    "all fall in the category of `` old open clusters '' ( see compilation in * ? ? ?",
    "* )  they all reside in the galactic thin disk , and have lower masses ( @xmath5few @xmath6  @xmath7 ) than typical ancient globular clusters ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the oldest of these old open clusters help to pinpoint the age of the thin disk , while the ages and masses of the entire population help constrain the survival rates of clusters in the galactic disk .",
    "intermediate - age clusters are also known to exist in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) .",
    "the lmc contains a population of clusters which are @xmath9  gyr , while the smc formed numerous clusters @xmath10  gyr ago .    in more distant galaxies",
    ", it becomes increasingly difficult to establish the presence of intermediate - age clusters , primarily because the techniques available to study compact clusters become more limited .",
    "for example , the integrated optical colors of intermediate - age clusters are degenerate with those of ancient ( @xmath11  gyr ) clusters .",
    "although a number of clusters have absorption line index strengths ( measured from integrated - light spectroscopy ) which suggest that these objects are of intermediate age , their absolute ages can not be definitively established due to the possible presence of hot stars in the core helium burning stage ( hot `` horizontal branch '' or hb stars ) .",
    "these hot hb stars could potentially boost the balmer absorption line strengths sufficiently to mimic younger ages for old globular clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ideally , cluster ages should be determined from deep color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) which reveal the main sequence turnoff ; to date however , this has only been accomplished for a single cluster beyond the magellanic clouds ( m31-skhb 312 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , using 129 orbits of _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) time .    in this letter , we present integrated - light ( optical ) spectroscopy for nine ancient star cluster candidates in the nearby spiral galaxy m33 .",
    "these clusters have deep cmds available from hst / wfpc2 observations , which clearly reveal the hb morphology .",
    "the combination of hb morphology and absorption line measurements result in robust relative age estimates , and are ideal to search for intermediate - age clusters in m33 .",
    "we obtained integrated spectroscopy for @xmath12 star clusters and cluster candidates in m33 using the mmt / hectospec instrument @xcite at a dispersion of 1.2    pix@xmath13 .",
    "in addition to clusters , a significant number of background regions were chosen , in order to sample the range of background light provided by the galaxy itself .",
    "the clusters were observed on the night of october 27/28 , 2005 , with four 1100 second exposures ( for a total of 73.3 minutes ) .",
    "each of the 300 hectospec fibers subtends @xmath14 on the sky .",
    "the data were reduced using the hsred reduction pipeline developed by r. cool .",
    "all observations were bias subtracted , overscan corrected , and trimmed .",
    "the science exposures were flat - fielded and combined together to eliminate cosmic rays , and one dimensional spectra were extracted and wavelength calibrated .",
    "the final resolution measured from the fwhm of henear comparison spectra was @xmath15   .",
    "spectra for the entire m33 cluster sample will be presented in a future work . here",
    ", we focus on a subset of nine clusters which have available cmds reaching below the hb ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s00 ) .    because the underlying galaxy light within each object fiber can affect the absorption line strengths , we created a mean background spectrum for each cluster .",
    "this was accomplished by averaging several background spectra chosen to match the galaxy background level measured in an annulus around each cluster from reduced m33 images provided by the local group survey ) .",
    "these customized background spectra were then subtracted from each object .",
    "for the nine clusters presented here , the cluster spectra have such high signal - to - noise , that the background subtraction has little impact . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we present integrated , background - subtracted spectra of the globular clusters discussed in this work .",
    "the relative ages and abundances of stellar populations can be estimated from integrated - light spectra , by comparing the absorption line strengths for age and metallicity - sensitive lines .",
    "the measurements and accompanying uncertainties are computed using the techniques described in @xcite , for line indices defined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the passband definitions were shifted to account for the radial velocity of each cluster , assuming the measurements given in @xcite . because no observations of lick standard stars have been made to date with mmt / hectospec",
    ", we do not calibrate the index measurements to the lick / ids system @xcite , and instead focus on _ relative _ cluster ages .",
    "a comparison of the line indices measured for the nine clusters presented in this work with predictions of the @xcite models is illustrated in figure  [ ps : am ] .",
    "the cmds for the nine clusters analyzed in this work were originally presented in sarajedini et al .",
    "( 2000 ; hereafter s00 ) .",
    "these are based on @xmath16 and @xmath17 observations taken with the hst / wfpc2 instrument .",
    "we refer the reader to s00 for details of data acquisition , reduction , and analysis .",
    "the cmds show that only m9 and u77 have blue hb stars ; the rest of the m33 clusters in the s00 sample have hbs which lie completely redward of the rr lyrae instability strip , in the so - called `` red clump '' .    here , we present new cmds based on the s00 data for two clusters of particular interest  m9 and c38 .",
    "these have been radially cleaned , so that blends and other contaminants from the crowded central regions are not included in the cmd . in figure",
    "[ fig : cmd ] we show the new cmds for these two clusters which are further discussed below .",
    "in figure  [ ps : am ] , we show the measurements for the metal - sensitive absorption line index [ mgfe ]  versus the age - sensitive balmer line indices h@xmath18 , h@xmath19 , and h@xmath20 , as is typically done to estimate the ages and chemical compositions of stellar populations from integrated - light spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . for comparison , we show simple stellar population ( ssp ) model predictions from @xcite for six different ages ( solid lines ) and",
    "six different values of [ z / h ] ( dashed lines ) .",
    "we also compared the m33 cluster measurements with the solar - scaled ssp model predictions of @xcite at 4.7    resolution ( not shown ) , which yield results consistent with the @xcite models .",
    "all panels in figure  [ ps : am ] show a `` cloud '' of points located towards low metallicities and old ages , although we can not rule out an age spread of the order of @xmath21 , which translates into a @xmath22  gyr spread at 12 gyr absolute age .",
    "cluster c38 is clearly offset from the  cloud \" in every panel , and clearly appears to have a younger age than the other clusters  recall that our measurements have not been absolutely calibrated to the models , but should be robust in a relative sense .",
    "therefore , figure  [ ps : am ] implies that c38 is @xmath23 gyr younger than the other m33 clusters plotted here .",
    "clusters with h@xmath24 seen in emission ( r14 and u77 ) are plotted with different symbols in figure  [ ps : am ] .",
    "the balmer absorption - line strengths for these clusters thus represent lower limits",
    ".    could the stronger balmer line indices for c38 , which suggest a younger age , be due to the presence of blue / hot hb stars ?",
    "in figure  [ fig : cmd ] , we show the resolved cmd of c38 based on deep hst / wfpc2 observations for this cluster , and also for m9 ( one of the older clusters ) for comparison . c38 shows no blue hb stars , while m9 does .",
    "note that the hst observations have sufficient depth and resolution to detect blue hbs if they are present , but they clearly do not exist in c38 .",
    "therefore , the presence of hot hb stars , which has been suggested as a plausible explanation for apparent intermediate ages of clusters in different galaxies ( such as in m31 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can not be the correct explanation in this case .",
    "the line indices and the knowledge of the hb morphology taken together , indicate that it is the _ age _ of the cluster which drives the observed balmer line strengths .",
    "there are two features from the resolved cmd of c38 shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] which add weight to this conclusion .",
    "first , s00 found that the absolute i band magnitude of the red clump for this cluster is more luminous than all of the others in their sample , and that this behavior is reasonably well fit by the @xmath25  gyr theoretical hb models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also figure  26 in s00 ) .",
    "secondly , when the cmd for c38 is cleaned to exclude the most crowded central regions , there appears to be a hint of a main sequence turnoff ( msto ) in the cmd , as illustrated in the left panel of figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "in contrast , m9 does not show evidence for a msto .",
    "also in this figure , we show a z = 0.004 isochrone at an age of 2  gyr from girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for comparison . taken together with the spectroscopic results and the abnormally bright red clump ,",
    "the presence of a msto in the cmd of c38 provides strong evidence that c38 is a genuine intermediate - age ( @xmath26  gyr ) star cluster in m33 .     versus @xmath27 cmd for m33 clusters c38 and m9 .",
    "the cmds have been restricted to include stars in an annulus between 1 and 2  away from the center of each cluster , in order to minimize blending and contamination . a girardi isochrone for an age of 2 gyr and @xmath28 is overplotted onto the c38 cmd , which shows the red clump stars and a hint of a main sequence turnoff .",
    "a fiducial hb for the galactic globular cluster m3 @xcite is overplotted onto the m33-m9 cmd , which clearly reveals the blue horizontal branch stars in this cluser.,width=321 ]      here we compile known properties of m33-c38 .",
    "this cluster lies at a projected distance of @xmath29 kpc from the center of m33 , has a total @xmath30-band magnitude of 18.01 and @xmath31 0.73 and @xmath32 colors @xcite .",
    "s00 estimated that it has an [ fe / h ] of @xmath33 from the slope of the red giant branch , which is consistent with our spectroscopy given the uncertainties ( [ fe / h]@xmath34 ) .",
    "@xcite measure a radial velocity of @xmath35 km / s for this cluster . the local hi ( disk ) velocity at the location of c38 is found to be @xmath36  km / s from the radio maps of @xcite .",
    "although the cluster velocity measurement deviates from the local disk motion in figure  [ fig : cmd ] of @xcite , ( showing a comparison of cluster velocities versus the local disk motions relative to cluster age , c38 falls in a region which is ambiguous as to which m33 component c38 belongs , clusters with the most deviant velocities are almost certainly in a halo / thick disk component ) . therefore",
    ", this object could belong to either the thin disk or a halo / thick disk component .",
    "implications for these possibilities are discussed in the next section .",
    "unfortunately m33-c38 does not have any published @xmath37 ratios , which would provide a direct estimate of its total mass .",
    "there are , however , published @xmath38 values for three of the clusters presented in this work ( h38 , m9 , and r12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "they have an average @xmath39 , which is consistent with @xmath38 measurements for galactic gcs @xcite .",
    "the integrated spectra presented here corroborate that these objects are ancient , even though their exact ages are not known .",
    "given the fact that @xmath38 _ decreases _ with decreasing age , as an upper limit for c38 we take the highest value found empirically by @xcite of @xmath40 .",
    "as a lower limit , we assume the @xmath38 value predicted by the @xcite models at an age of 2  gyr and for a low metallicity system ( @xmath41 ) . assuming a foreground reddening @xmath42 mag towards m33 and a distance modulus of 24.64 mag",
    ", we estimate that c38 has a mass in the range @xmath43 .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude higher than the masses for old galactic open clusters , and within the range of ancient globular clusters .",
    "the confirmed presence of an intermediate - age cluster in m33 has important implications for star / cluster formation processes in spiral galaxies , regardless of which structural component c38 belongs to .",
    "below we explore the implications of the presence of intermediate - age clusters in both a thick disk versus halo component , and also in the thin disk .",
    "if c38 belongs to either a thick disk or halo component , it is likely that at least a few of the other clusters in our sample belong to the same structural component , so that a relatively large age spread among m33 clusters would be present in that component . in the galaxy ,",
    "halo gcs are known to be old and have an age spread of only @xmath44  gyr , whereas the gcs associated with the thick disk are essentially coeval @xcite .",
    "we suggest that a large age spread for m33 clusters would favor a halo over a thick disk origin , for the following reasons .",
    "the thick disk in the milky way is relatively metal - rich , and believed to have formed during a single event , likely the accretion of a relatively massive satellite galaxy which puffed up the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . such an origin for",
    "a thick disk in m33 would imply that clusters in m33 formed for many gyr relatively undisturbed in the disk , until several gyr ago when an accretion event took place , resulting in a thick disk with a cluster population spanning a large range of ages .",
    "given that to date there is no evidence for such an event in m33 , and that this type of scenario would require that no significant merging occurred before or since , we suggest that it is unlikely that clusters residing in a thick disk would have an age spread of several gyr .",
    "therefore , the presence of c38 seems to favor a halo component over a thick disk component .",
    "this would point to a longer timescale for the buildup of the m33 halo relative to that found for the milky way , as suggested previously by s00 and @xcite .",
    "if instead of the halo / thick disk , c38 resides in the thin disk of m33 ( the velocity measurements are ambiguous in discriminating between these two possibilities ) , the intermediate age of this object also has important implications .",
    "first , this would confirm the presence of relatively massive , intermediate - age disk clusters , which are not widely observed in our own galaxy ( but might be hidden behind large columns of dust ) .",
    "second , the ability of massive clusters @xmath45 ) to survive in the disk of m33 has been suggested to be limited to @xmath46  gyr .",
    "@xcite used cluster samples in m33 and their theory of cluster dissolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to estimate directly from the cluster age and mass distributions the ability of clusters to survive in different environments . for m33",
    ", they find that @xmath47 clusters will disrupt in @xmath48 years ( @xmath49  myr ) , and that a @xmath50 cluster will disrupt in @xmath51  gyr .",
    "mass estimates for c38 put it at @xmath52 .",
    "although we do not know its precise age , it appears that c38 has likely survived @xmath53 times longer than this prediction .",
    "regardless , if c38 is part of m33 s thin disk , this points to the formation of a star cluster which is more massive than known counterparts of a similar age in the local group , and also to the ability of such an object to survive disruption forces in the environment of m33 for several billion years .",
