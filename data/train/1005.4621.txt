    "compton scattering , @xmath0 , with initial photons real or virtual , has been intensively investigated theoretically and experimentally @xcite . in the case of deeply - virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , where the initial photon is highly - virtual",
    ", the qcd factorization has been proven @xcite and the amplitude can be expressed in terms of the generalized parton distributions ( gpd ) @xcite convoluted with some hard coefficient function .",
    "however , it is not possible to make a deconvolution and unambiguously extract the gpds of the target from the experimental dvcs data .",
    "the standard procedure in this case is to construct a plausible model with some free parameters , fix the free parameters from the experimental data and after that make conclusions about the gpds of the target .",
    "the situation is different in case of double deeply virtual compton scattering ( ddvcs ) , @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "as it has been shown in  @xcite , the ddvcs amplitude allows such a deconvolution .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding cross - section of the process is suppressed by @xmath2 compared to ordinary dvcs and falls into a picobarn - level range , so it can not be accessed by the existing accelerating facilities . however , at future accelerating facilities @xcite with higher luminosities , this cross - section can be measured .",
    "a special case , when the initial photon is real , has been studied in  @xcite , and in the color dipole framework in @xcite .",
    "this process may be viewed as time - inverted dvcs with negative virtuality @xmath3 , so the color dipole model is applicable for high lepton masses , @xmath4 a high luminosity flux of real photons may be created by ultraperipheral scattering of protons on nuclei ; such collisions at the lhc will be an ideal tool for the study of this process . however , it is not possible to access the whole ddvcs amplitude in ultraperipheral hadronic collisions , since the virtuality of the initial photon , controlled by the formfactors of the colliding hadrons , can not be very high .",
    "thus , the only way to study the ddvcs is the electroproduction of lepton pairs , @xmath5 .",
    "recently dvcs on proton and nuclear targets has been studied within the color dipole approach in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend that study to the ddvcs case .",
    "we focus on the high - energy kinematics range , since the future accelerating facilities are expected to operate at these energies  @xcite , where the effects of coherence are important .",
    "the general framework for evaluating the shadowing corrections is the gribov - glauber approach  @xcite . in particular , we take into account gluon shadowing corrections , which correspond to the triple - pomeron diffraction in the gribov inelastic shadowing corrections .",
    "these corrections onset at @xmath6 , and give a sizeable contribution to nuclear shadowing at @xmath7 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections  [ sec :",
    "dipolemodel ] we review the general formalism of the color dipole approach . in section",
    "[ sec : frozen ] we discuss the frequently used frozen approximation , which is valid for asymptotically large energies . in section",
    "[ sec : sha - coh ] we discuss the method which will be used for calculations of nuclear shadowing effects and demonstrate that for asymptotically large energies it reproduces the results from  section  [ sec : frozen ] . in section  [ sec : gluonshadowing ]",
    "we discuss the gluon shadowing and its effect on the ddvcs observables . in section  [ sec : wffromivm ] the wavefunction of a real photon is evaluated in the instanton vacuum model . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the results of numerical evaluation and draw conclusions .",
    "the electroproduction cross - section for unpolarized lepton pairs in the ddvcs process has a form    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the cross - section of the process @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the invariant mass of the produced lepton pair , and @xmath12 is the square of the momentum transferred to a target . in",
    "what follows , we will concentrate on evaluation of the cross - section @xmath9 . for the unpolarized compton scattering discussed in this paper we obtain , @xmath13    where the amplitude @xmath14 is evaluated in the color dipole model . in this model the dominant contribution to the compton amplitude comes from gluonic exchanges .",
    "then the general expression for the compton amplitude on a nucleon has the form ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the photon polarization vector ; @xmath17 are the light - cone fractional momenta of the quark and antiquark , @xmath18 are the transverse distances in the final and initial dipoles respectively ; @xmath19 is the momentum transfer in the compton scattering * * , * * @xmath20 is the scattering amplitude of the dipole on the target ( proton or nucleus ) , and @xmath21 are the light - cone distribution functions of the initial and final photons in the polarization state @xmath22 . when the virtuality of the corresponding photon is large , we may use the well - known pqed expressions  @xcite,@xmath23 where @xmath24 , and make an analytical continuation of the space - like wave functions to the time - like photons by a simple extrapolation , @xmath25  @xcite , and use @xmath26 where @xmath27 for the kinematics @xmath28 .",
    "however when the virtualities are small , we have to resort to some model ( see section  [ sec : wffromivm ] for more details ) .    at high energies in the small angle approximation , @xmath29 , the quark separation and fractional momenta @xmath30",
    "are preserved , so @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the gluon gpd of the target , @xmath33 @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the gluon loop operator , @xmath36 is the wilson factor required by gauge covariance . for this gpd",
    "we use a gaussian parameterization  @xcite ,    @xmath37    where the phenomenological functions @xmath38 are fitted to dis , real photoproduction and @xmath39 scattering data .",
    "we discuss them in more detail in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the parameterization  ( [ eq : gpdparametrization ] ) does not depend on the longitudinal momentum transfer and decreases exponentially as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "since the parameterization  ( [ eq : gpdparametrization ] ) is an effective one and is valid only in the small-@xmath41 region , we do not assume that it satisfies general requirements , such as positivity  @xcite and polynomiality  @xcite constraints .",
    "the prefactor @xmath42 in  ( [ eq : gpdparametrization ] ) guarantees convergence of the integrals in the parameterization  ( [ eq : dvcsim - bk ] ) . in the forward limit",
    ", @xmath43 , the amplitude ( [ eq : dvcsim - bk ] ) reduces to the saturated parameterization of the dipole amplitude proposed by golec - biernat and wsthoff ( gbw )  @xcite , @xmath44 generally , the amplitude @xmath45 involves nonperturbative physics , but its asymptotic behavior for small  @xmath46 is controlled by pqcd @xcite:@xmath47 up to slowly varying corrections @xmath48 .",
    "the calculation of the differential cross section also involves the real part of scattering amplitude , whose relation to the imaginary part is quite straightforward . according to @xcite , if the limit @xmath49 exists and is finite , then the real and imaginary parts of the forward amplitude are related as@xmath50\\frac{\\im m\\,{f(\\delta=0)}}{s^{\\alpha}}.\\label{eq : bronzanful}\\ ] ] in the model under consideration the imaginary part of the forward dipole amplitude indeed has a power dependence on energy , @xmath51 , so ( [ eq : bronzanful ] ) simplifies to @xmath52    this fixes the phase of the forward compton amplitude , which we retain for nonzero momentum transfers , assuming similar dependences for the real and imaginary parts",
    ". finally we arrive at , @xmath53",
    "nuclear shadowing signals the closeness of the unitarity limit .",
    "hard reactions possess this feature only if they have a contribution from soft interactions . in dis and",
    "dvcs the soft contribution arises from the so called aligned jet configurations @xcite , corresponding to @xmath54 fluctuations very asymmetric in sharing the photon momentum , @xmath55 .",
    "such virtual photon fluctuations , having large transverse separation , are the source of shadowing @xcite .",
    "calculation of nuclear shadowing simplifies considerably in the case of long coherence length @xcite , i.e. long lifetime of the photon fluctuations , when it considerably exceeds the nuclear size . in this case",
    "lorentz time dilation `` freezes '' the transverse size of the fluctuation during propagation though the nucleus .",
    "then the compton amplitude of coherent scattering , which leaves the nucleus intact , has the same form as eq .",
    "( [ eq : dvcs - im - conv ] ) with a replacement of the nucleon compton amplitude by the nuclear one , @xmath56,\\label{nucl - coh}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is impact parameter of the photon - nucleus collision , @xmath58 is the nuclear thickness function , given by the integral of nuclear density along the direction of the collisions . in this expression",
    "we neglect the real part of the amplitude which is particularly small for a coherent nuclear interaction .    for incoherent compton scattering , which results in nuclear fragmentation without particle production ( quasielastic scattering ) , the cross section has the form @xcite ,    @xmath59\\,\\left\\ { \\exp\\left[\\frac{\\sigma_{\\bar{q}q}(r)\\,\\sigma_{\\bar{q}q}(r')}{16\\pi\\ , b_{el}}\\ , t_{a}(b)\\right]-1\\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\   & \\approx & \\frac{e^{b_{el}t}}{16\\pi}\\int d^{2}b\\ , t_{a}\\left(b\\right)\\left|\\int\\limits _ { 0}^{1}d\\beta\\ , d^{2}r\\,\\bar{\\psi}_{f}\\left(\\beta , r\\right)\\sigma_{\\bar{q}q}\\left(r , s\\right)\\psi_{in}\\left(\\beta , r\\right)\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{\\bar{q}q}\\left(r\\right)t_{a}\\left(b\\right)\\right]\\right|^{2}.\\label{eq : quasielastic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath60 is the @xmath12-slope of elastic dipole - nucleon amplitude . in this equation",
    "we treated the term quadratic in the dipole cross section as a small number and expanded the exponential in curly brackets .",
    "the regime of frozen dipole size discussed in the previous section is valid only at very small @xmath61 , or at high energies .",
    "however , at medium small @xmath61 a dipole can `` breath '' , i.e. vary its size , during propagation through the nucleus , and one should rely on a more sophisticated approach .",
    "in this paper we employ the description of the onset of shadowing developed in  @xcite and based on the light - cone green function technique @xcite .",
    "the propagation of a color dipole in a nuclear medium is described as motion in an absorptive potential , _ i.e. _ @xmath62 where the green function @xmath63 describes the probability amplitude for the propagation of dipole state with size @xmath64 at the light - cone starting point @xmath65 to the dipole state with size @xmath66 at the light - cone point @xmath67 and @xmath68 then the shadowing correction to the amplitude has the form@xmath69    equation  ( [ eq : w - definition ] ) is quite complicated and in the general case may be solved only numerically @xcite .",
    "however in some cases an analytic solution is possible .",
    "for example , in the limit of long coherence length , @xmath70 , relevant for high - energy accelerators like the lhc , one can neglect the `` kinetic '' term  @xmath71 in  ( [ eq : w - definition ] ) , and get the green function in the `` frozen '' approximation @xcite , @xmath72 then the shadowing correction  ( [ eq : correction ] ) simplifies to @xmath73 if we neglect the real part of the amplitude and the longitudinal momentum transfer @xmath74 ( which is justified for asymptotically large @xmath75 ) , and average over polarizations , then taking the integral over @xmath76  by parts  in  ( [ eq : dvcs - coh - sha ] ) , we get for the elastic amplitude @xmath77\\psi_{in}\\left(\\alpha , r\\right).\\label{eq : a - frozen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] another case where an analytical solution is possible is when the effective dipole sizes are small and the function @xmath78 may be approximated as @xmath79 this approximation can not be precise even at high virtualities @xmath80 and @xmath11 in ddvcs , since there are contributions of the aligned jet configurations mentioned above , which permit large dipoles even for large virtualities .",
    "moreover , such aligned jet configurations of the dipole provide the main contribution to nuclear shadowing @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for the sake of simplicity we use this approximation in order to _ estimate _ the magnitude of the shadowing corrections in the region @xmath81 .",
    "the approximation  ( [ eq : sigma - small - r ] ) is well justified on heavy nuclei .",
    "namely , nuclear shadowing is independent of the form of the dipole cross section for large dipole sizes , above the saturation point , @xmath82 , where the typical value of the saturation momentum is @xmath83 for heavy nuclei .",
    "indeed , in this case the nucleus is `` black '' .",
    "therefore the shape of the dipole cross section matters only at @xmath84 .",
    "this size is sufficiently small for using the @xmath85 approximation  ( [ eq : sigma - small - r ] ) .",
    "numerically , the approximation  ( [ eq : sigma - small - r ] ) was tested in  @xcite  it was found that the discrepancy between the approximation  ( [ eq : sigma - small - r ] ) and the exact numerical solution of  ( [ eq : w - definition ] ) , changes the nuclear shadowing for dis only within ten percent .",
    "we expect that within the same accuracy the approximation  ( [ eq : sigma - small - r ] ) is valid for dvcs .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eq : w - definition ] ) yields for @xmath86 the well - known evolution operator of harmonic oscillator , although with complex frequency @xmath87\\right)e^{ik_{min}\\left(z_{2}-z_{1}\\right)},\\label{eq : w - oscillator}\\\\ \\omega^{2 } & = & \\frac{-2ic\\rho_{a}}{\\nu\\alpha(1-\\alpha)},\\nonumber \\\\ a^{2 } & = & -ic\\rho_{a}\\nu\\alpha(1-\\alpha)/2\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "it has been known since  @xcite that in addition to the quark shadowing inside nuclei there is also shadowing of gluons , which leads to attenuation of the gluon parton distributions . while nuclear shadowing of quarks is directly measured in dis , the shadowing of gluons is poorly known from data  @xcite , mainly due to the relatively large error bars in the nuclear structure functions and their weak dependence on the gluon distributions , which only comes via evolution .",
    "the theoretical predictions for gluon shadowing strongly depend on the implemented model  while for @xmath88 they all predict that the gluon shadowing is small or absent , for @xmath6 the predictions vary in a wide range ( see the review  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "some of the recent analysis @xcite led to such a strong gluon shadowing , that the unitarity bound @xcite was severely broken . since in this paper",
    "we also make predictions for the lhc energy range , the gluon shadowing corrections should be taken into account as well .",
    "the attenuation factor @xmath89 @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the impact parameter dependent gluon pdf , was evaluated in the dipole approach in  @xcite .",
    "it was found convenient to evaluate @xmath89 relating it to the shadowing corrections in dis with longitudinally polarized photons , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the shadowing correction at impact parameter @xmath57 , and @xmath94 is the total photoabsorption  cross section for a longitudinal photon . the process with longitudinal photons is chosen because the aligned jets configurations are suppressed by powers of @xmath80 , so that the average size of the dipole is small , @xmath95 and nuclear shadowing mainly originates from gluons .    as it was shown in  @xcite ,    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is the nuclear density , and  @xmath98 is defined as @xmath99\\\\   & \\times & \\left[\\frac{t}{w}+\\frac{\\sinh\\left(\\omega\\delta z\\right)}{t}\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{t^{2}}{u^{2}}\\right)+\\frac{2t^{3}}{uw^{2}}+\\frac{t\\sinh\\left(\\omega\\delta z\\right)}{w^{2}}+\\frac{4t^{3}}{w^{3}}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath100 notice the importance of the @xmath101-independent term in @xmath102 , which controls the mean quark - gluon , or glue - glue separation at low scale .",
    "the magnitude of this term dictated by various experimental data @xcite and especially by data on diffraction @xcite , is rather large @xmath103 .",
    "this leads to a small dipole sizes @xmath104fm and weak gluon shadowing .    for heavy nuclei we may rely on the hard sphere approximation , @xmath105 , and simplify  ( [ eq : deltasigmagluon ] ) to :",
    "@xmath106 where @xmath107 for the total cross - section after integration over @xmath108 we get @xmath109 the results of the evaluation of the gluon shadowing are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "in this section we present briefly some details of the evaluation of the photon wavefunction in the instanton vacuum model  ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the central object of the model is the effective action for the light quarks in the instanton vacuum , which in the leading order in @xmath110 has the form  @xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 is one of the matrices , @xmath113 ,  @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the fields of constituent quarks and mesons respectively , @xmath116 is the density of the instanton gas , @xmath117 is the external vector current corresponding to the photon , @xmath118 is the gauge factor , @xmath119 which provides the gauge covariance of the action , and @xmath120 is the fourier transform of the zero - mode profile .    in the leading order in @xmath110",
    ", we have the same feynman rules as in perturbative theory , but with a momentum - dependent quark mass @xmath121 in the quark propagator@xmath122 the mass of the constituent quark has a form @xmath123 where @xmath124  mev is the current quark mass , @xmath125  mev is the dynamical mass generated by the interaction with the instanton vacuum background . due to the presence of the instantons the coupling of a vector current to a quark",
    "is also modified,@xmath126 notice that for an arbitrary photon momentum @xmath127 the expression for @xmath128 depends on the choice of the path in  ( [ eq : l - factor ] ) and as a result one can find in the literature different expressions used for evaluations  @xcite . in the limit",
    "@xmath129 the function @xmath120 falls off as @xmath130 so for large @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the mean instanton size , the mass of the quark @xmath133 and the vector current interaction vertex @xmath134 .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize that the wavefunction @xmath135 gets contributions from both the soft and the hard parts , so even in the large-@xmath101 limit the instanton vacuum function is different from the well - known perturbative result .    we have to evaluate the wavefunctions associated with the following matrix elements :    @xmath136    where @xmath137 is one of the matrices @xmath138 in the leading order in @xmath110 one can easily obtain@xmath139 the evaluation of  ( [ eq : wf - lo ] ) is quite tedious but straightforward .",
    "details of this evaluation may be found in  @xcite .    in what follows ,",
    "we use eqn  ( [ eq : wf - lo ] ) for the evaluation of the initial and final wavefunctions @xmath140 . without any loss of generality",

    "while currently there is no data for ddvcs , we expect that similar to dvcs the experiments will be done in the region of large virtualities @xmath149 in that region we have bjorken scaling , so all the model parameters such as basic cross - section @xmath150 and saturation radius @xmath151 in eq .",
