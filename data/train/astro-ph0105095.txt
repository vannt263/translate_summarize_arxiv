    "spiral galaxies are characterized by their flattened disks ( with approximately exponential profiles ) and nearly flat rotation curves .",
    "the main observational parameters that describe the overall properties of a spiral galaxy are the central surface brightness @xmath8 , the disk scale - length @xmath2 and the characteristic rotation velocity ( e.g. the maximum rotation velocity @xmath1 ) .",
    "the observed disk population covers a large range in these parameters , with @xmath8 varying from @xmath9 ( low surface brightness galaxies ) to @xmath10 , @xmath2 from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , and @xmath1 from @xmath13 to @xmath14 . despite the diversities , spiral galaxies obey a well - defined scaling relation between their total luminosity @xmath0 and maximum rotation velocity @xmath1 .",
    "this relation ( called the tully - fisher relation , hereafter tf relation ) is usually expressed in the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the slope , and @xmath17 is the zero - point .",
    "the observed tf relation is quite tight .",
    "for example , in the @xmath18-band , the scatter in luminosities for a fixed @xmath1 is only about 0.38 magnitude ( giovanelli et al .",
    "thus , the tf relation can be used as a relative distance indicator for spiral galaxies .",
    "it is still unclear whether the scatter in the observed tf relation is dominated by observational errors or by intrinsic variations .",
    "since intrinsic scatter must exist to some degree , a natural question is whether there is a third parameter that correlates with the residual scatter of the tf relation .",
    "the situation is quite similar to that for elliptical galaxies .",
    "although elliptical galaxies are found to obey the faber - jackson relation ( a relation between luminosity @xmath0 and central velocity dispersion @xmath19 ) , the fundamental - plane ( hereafter fp ) relation ( with the introduction of a third parameter , the effective radius @xmath20 ) has much smaller scatter ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) . for disk galaxies , due to the broad distribution of scale - length @xmath2 ,",
    "one obvious choice of the third parameter is @xmath2 or the central surface brightness @xmath8 ( @xmath8 and @xmath2 are related by @xmath21 for an exponential disk ) . on the other hand ,",
    "since disk galaxies also present diversities in their rotation - curve shapes ( persic , salucci & stel 1996 ) , another possible choice may be a parameter that characterizes the rotation - curve profile .",
    "much effort has been made in searching for this third parameter ( e.g. kodaira 1989 ; han 1991 ; tully & verheijen 1997 ; willick et al .",
    "1997 ; courteau & rix 1999 ; willick 1999 ) , but the results are still inconclusive . while most of the studies cited above concluded that the third parameter is not crucial , some of them did find evidence for the existence of a third parameter ( e.g. kodaira 1989 ; willick 1999 ) .",
    "more recently , koda , sofue & wada ( 2000a ) obtained a scaling plane in the form of @xmath22 from both observational data and numerical simulations .",
    "but the radius @xmath23 in this relation is not really a new degree of freedom , because it is bounded to the rotation velocity @xmath24 with the same power index @xmath16 .    from theoretical side ,",
    "there are many attempts to understand the formation of disk galaxies in the framework provided by current cosmogonic models ( e.g. cdm models : fall & efstathiou 1980 ; white & frenk 1991 ; dalcanton , spergel & summes 1997 ; mo , mao & white 1998 , hereafter mmw ) .",
    "the current standard scenario of disk formation assumes that galaxy disks form as a result of gas cooling in dark matter haloes .",
    "detailed modeling shows that such models are quite successful in interpreting observational data , especially the observed tf relation ( mmw ; van den bosch 1998 , 2000 ; avila - reese , firmani & hernandez 1998 ; weil , eke & efstathiou 1998 ; heavens & jimenez 1999 ; mo & mao 2000 ; navarro & steinmetz 2000 ; koda , sofue & wada 2000b ; zou & han 2000 ; cole et al .",
    "2000 ; buchalter , jimenez & kamionkowski 2001 ) . in the cdm cosmogonies , the characteristic rotation velocity of a disk galaxy is determined largely by the potential of the dark matter while the luminosity of the disk is given by the amount of stars ( baryons ) in the disk .",
    "the observed tf relation therefore implies a tight relation between the disk mass and the depth of the dark halo potential well , and its scatter may be used to constrain models of galaxy formation .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to examine whether fp - like relations exist for the disk population based on current theoretical models of disk formation , and to provide some theoretical guidelines for the search of fp - like relations .",
    "moreover , we explore the possibility of using such relations as a tool to understand galaxy formation by examining the response of the theoretical scaling relations to the changes of model parameters .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the model and summarizes the model parameters . in section 3",
    ", we search for the theoretical fp relation and examine its responses to the variations of model parameters . in section 4 ,",
    "some preliminary results obtained from observational data are presented and compared with our model predictions . finally , in section 5",
    ", we make further discussions and summarize our main conclusions .",
    "our model here follows that presented in mo , mao & white ( 1998 , hereafter mmw ) .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper for details ; here we only introduce the main ingredients relevant to our analyses .",
    "the initial density profiles of dark haloes are assumed to take the universal form , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a characteristic radius , @xmath27 is the critical density and @xmath28 is a constant ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ) .",
    "we define the radius of a dark halo to be @xmath29 within which the mean density is 200 times the critical density , and represent the characteristic radius by the concentration , @xmath30 .",
    "it is then easy to show that @xmath31 the radius @xmath29 and mass @xmath32 of a halo can be expressed in terms of its circular velocity @xmath33 as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath36 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath37 .",
    "we relate the initial angular momentum @xmath38 of a halo to its spin parameter @xmath39 through the definition @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the total energy of the halo .",
    "a dark halo is therefore described by three parameters : the circular velocity @xmath33 , the concentration @xmath42 and the spin parameter @xmath39 . as a result of dissipative and radiative processes",
    ", the gas component gradually settles into a disk .",
    "we assume the disk mass to be a fraction @xmath7 of the halo mass , and the disk angular momentum to be @xmath43 times @xmath38 .",
    "thus , two other parameters , @xmath43 and @xmath7 are introduced to relate the halo properties to the properties of the final disk .",
    "following mmw , we also assume that disks have exponential surface density profiles with a constant mass - to - light ratio @xmath44 , and that dark haloes respond to disk growth adiabatically . under these assumptions ,",
    "we can obtain the luminosity @xmath0 , the disk scale length @xmath2 and the rotation curve @xmath45 for a given set of model parameters .",
    "specifically , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are factors which depend on halo profile and disk action .",
    "we use the same procedure outlined in mmw to calculate @xmath47 and @xmath48 as functions of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath7 and @xmath39 .      as discussed above , five parameters ( @xmath33 , @xmath39 , @xmath42 , @xmath7 and @xmath43 ) need to be specified for individual haloes in order to predict the properties of the disks that form within them . in this subsection",
    "we describe one by one how these parameters are chosen in our modelling .",
    "the distribution of halo masses is derived from the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 , hereafter ps ) applied to the @xmath49cdm cosmogony ( with mass density parameter @xmath50 , cosmological constant @xmath51 , hubble s constant @xmath52 , perturbation - spectrum normalization @xmath53 ) .",
    "we select the host haloes of disks with circular velocities in the range from @xmath54 to 300@xmath55 at redshift @xmath56 . the choice of cosmogony does not change our main results , because we are not interested in the exact distribution of galaxies with respect to mass .",
    "n - body simulations show that the distribution of halo spin parameter @xmath39 can be approximated by a log - normal function , @xmath57    \\frac{d\\lambda}{\\lambda},\\ ] ] with @xmath58=0.05 and @xmath59 .",
    "this distribution is found to be quite independent of cosmology and of halo mass ( warren et al .",
    "1992 ; lemson & kauffmann 1999 ) .",
    "syer , mao & mo ( 1999 ) obtained a similar distribution function for @xmath39 from the observational data of disk sizes . in this paper , we use equation ( [ p_of_lambda ] ) for the distribution of @xmath39 .",
    "the halo concentration , @xmath42 , may depend on halo formation history and cosmogony .",
    "simulations show that the circular - velocity dependence of the nfw concentration @xmath42 can be approximated by @xmath60 ( see nfw ) . using @xmath61-body simulations , jing ( 2000 ) found that the distribution of @xmath42 for the majority of his simulated haloes can be described by a log - normal function with a mean @xmath62 slightly smaller than that of the nfw result : @xmath63d\\ln c'\\ , , ~c'\\equiv c / c_{\\rm nfw}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in this paper , we take @xmath66 as is given in the original nfw paper , use equation ( [ c_nfw ] ) to obtain @xmath67 and equation ( [ p_of_c ] ) for the distribution of @xmath42 .",
    "this parameter represents the ratio between the disk mass and the total halo mass .",
    "the processes by which gas cools into a disk to form stars are complicated and not well understood at the present time .",
    "nevertheless , some limits can be set .",
    "first , the value of @xmath7 should be smaller than the overall baryon fraction in the universe @xmath68 , which is about 0.1 for a low - density universe with @xmath50 and @xmath52 , and about 0.05 for an einstein - de sitter universe with @xmath69 , according to the cosmic nucleosynthesis theory .",
    "second , the value of @xmath7 should not be much smaller than 0.01 , because disks with lower gas content may not be able to form sufficient amount of stars to be included in a tf sample .",
    "thus , we set the range of @xmath7 to be from 0.01 to 0.1 and take 0.05 as the typical value",
    ". we will also consider a case where @xmath7 changes systematically with @xmath33 .",
    "this parameter characterizes the ratio between the specific angular momentum of the disk and that of the dark halo .",
    "although disk material may have the same initial specific angular momentum as the dark matter , little is known about the transfer of angular momentum between gas and dark matter in subsequent evolutions . from earlier theoretical considerations ( e.g. mmw ) we know that @xmath70 is required in order to ensure the predicted disk sizes to match observations . in our model , we allow @xmath43 to have @xmath71 chance to be in the range @xmath72@xmath73 , and another @xmath71 chance to be in the range @xmath73@xmath74 .",
    "thus , we adopt for @xmath43 a simple distribution function of the form : @xmath75      in order to search for a fp relation for theoretical disks , we need to choose three observable parameters to define the plane . we take the luminosity @xmath0 and a characteristic rotation velocity @xmath24 as the two fundamental quantities . in most of our discussions ,",
    "we use the maximum velocity @xmath1 as the characteristic velocity , but we also discuss the effects of using rotation velocities at other radii . for the third quantity , we try two different choices based on the discussion in the previous section : the disk scale - length @xmath2 and a rotation - curve shape parameter @xmath76 ( to be defined below ) .    the procedure for obtaining the fp is as follows .",
    "we first generate a monte - carlo sample of 1000 haloes from the ps formalism , with @xmath33 in the range between 50 and @xmath77 .",
    "we then assign to each halo the other four parameters by monte - carlo simulations .",
    "finally we use the model of mmw to predict the properties of each model galaxy . as in mmw ,",
    "we exclude unstable disks with @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the gas mass of the disk ( e.g. christodoulou , shlosman & tohline 1995 ) . on the other hand",
    ", galaxies with very low density may not form stars .",
    "we therefore also exclude disks with toomre parameter @xmath80 where @xmath19 is the gas velocity dispersion , @xmath81 is the epicyclic frequency , and @xmath82 is the mass surface density ( kennicutt 1989 ) . in our model , we use the average surface mass density inside the half - mass radius ( about @xmath83 ) to replace @xmath82 , and adopt @xmath84 .",
    "we assume that all disks have the same mass - to - light ratio and take @xmath85 in the @xmath18-band ( bottema 1997 ) .",
    "all the results are for disks at @xmath56 and we take @xmath52 whenever an explicit value of @xmath86 is used .",
    "in this section , we try to find the fp of disk galaxies in the @xmath87-@xmath88-@xmath89-space .",
    "the reason is clear : while @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the two parameters in the conventional tf relation , the choice of @xmath2 as the third parameter is motivated by the fact that disk galaxies cover a large range of @xmath2 .",
    "we define the fp as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the absolute magnitude of the disk in the @xmath18-band , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are constants which are obtained by a least - square fit of equation ( [ fpfit ] ) to the monte - carlo data . in the disk model outlined above , there are four parameters , @xmath39 , @xmath7 , @xmath43 and @xmath42 , whose effects on the fp relation need to be evaluated . if all these four parameters are set to be constant , the predicted tf relation is a line with no scatter .",
    "the scatter in any one of these four parameters can cause scatter in the tf relation ( see e.g. mmw , mo & mao 2000 ) .",
    "the first question is whether some of the scatter can be eliminated or reduced in the fp relation . in order to show this ,",
    "we first construct four samples where scatter is allowed only in one of the four model parameters while the other parameters taking their typical values ( see table 1 ) . in these cases , we ignore the selection criteria given by equations ( [ epsilon_m ] ) and ( [ toomre_q ] ) , and so some of the model galaxies in these samples may not correspond to any realistic disks .",
    "the scaling relations are shown in figure 1 , while the fitting results of these relations are listed in table 1 .",
    "the scatters on both the tf relation and the fp relation are represented by the root - mean - square deviation ( @xmath95 ) of @xmath91 .",
    "= 14.0 cm    comparing the scatter of the tf relation and the corresponding fp relation , we see that the introduction of @xmath2 as the third parameter is very effective in reducing the scatter caused by @xmath39 , @xmath43 and @xmath42 but less so in reducing the scatter caused by @xmath7 .",
    "notice that the fps in different cases are tilted significantly with each other , except cases of varying @xmath39 and @xmath43 ( see table 1 ) .",
    ".the effects of changing individual model parameters on the tf relation and the fp relation defined by equation ( [ fpfit ] ) .",
    "column 1 lists the name of each case , columns 2 to 6 give the model parameters ( which are either a single number , or a range , or an equation of distribution ) , columns 7 to 9 show the fitting results for the fp relation , while columns 10 and 11 list the scatter of the magnitude @xmath91 in the fp and tf relations , respectively [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     these results show that the introduction of the shape parameter of rotation curves as the third parameter can reduce the scatter of the tf relation , but the two parameters considered here are less effective than @xmath2 in all the cases except in case iii where the tf scatter is effectively reduced by the introduction of @xmath96 or @xmath97 .",
    "this suggests that these shape parameters are effective in reducing the scatter caused by @xmath7 ( due to disk action ) but not so much in reducing the scatter caused by @xmath39@xmath43 and @xmath42 .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are both more difficult to measure than @xmath2 from observations , and it is not yet possible to obtain such a fp from observational data .",
    "notice that the slope @xmath92 associated with the two shape parameters is very sensitive to the change of model parameters , because the ranges of these parameters are relatively small .    from the above discussion",
    "we see that the disk scale - length @xmath2 is effective in reducing the tf scatter caused by @xmath98 ( figure 2 ) and @xmath42 ( figure 3 ) , while the rotation - curve shape parameters are more effective in reducing the scatter caused by @xmath7 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see what happens if both @xmath2 and one of the rotation - curve shape parameters are introduced to define a plane in the four - dimensional space spanned by @xmath91 , @xmath99 , @xmath88 , and @xmath96 ( or @xmath97 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure 8 for case iv . as expected , the scatter is significantly reduced .      in reality , the value of @xmath7 may depend systematically on halo circular velocity , as is the case if feedback effects can eject gas more effectively from smaller haloes ( e.g. white & frenk 1991 ) . to model",
    "this effect , we construct a sample where @xmath7 is assumed to change with @xmath33 as @xmath100^{-1}(1+\\delta)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is a random number between @xmath102 and 0.1 .",
    "other parameters are chosen the same as in case iv .",
    "this case is listed as case vi in tables 2 and 4 , and the results are shown in figure 9 .    in this case",
    "the tf relation is @xmath103 [ the solid line in panel ( a ) of figure 9 ] , which has a much steeper slope ( @xmath104 ) than all other cases we have considered .",
    "correspondingly , the slope @xmath93 in the fp relation ( with @xmath2 as the third parameter ) is also steeper , but the value of @xmath92 does not change much ( see table 2 ) . the introduction of @xmath96 ( or @xmath97 ) as the third parameter does not help much in reducing the tf scatter because , with the assumed small scatter in @xmath7 , the tf scatter is dominated by the variations in @xmath39@xmath43 and @xmath42 .",
    "since the rotation - curve shape parameters are correlated with @xmath7 , it is interesting to see if these parameters can be used to reveal the trend of @xmath7 with @xmath33 . to do this , we examine the correlation between @xmath91 and @xmath96 ( or @xmath97 ) for case vi and compare the results with those for case iv .",
    "the results are shown in figure 10 .",
    "as one can see , if @xmath7 is correlated with @xmath33 , then there is a strong correlation between @xmath91 and @xmath96 ( or @xmath97 ) , in the sense that more luminous galaxies have smaller @xmath96 ( or @xmath97 ) .",
    "such correlations are in fact observed by persic , salucci & stel ( 1996 ) , but the data are still too uncertain to give any meaningful constraints on the model .",
    "having seen the theoretical expectations for the scaling relations of spiral galaxies , one is obviously interested in seeing what observations actually show . here",
    "we present some preliminary results without going into the details of the observational selection effects , leaving a more sophisticated analysis to a future paper .",
    "the data we use are from dale et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , which presents tf observations for 35 rich abell clusters of galaxies in the @xmath18-band , along with the exponential scale - lengths @xmath2 .",
    "we simply use the published data without correcting for any bias .",
    "panel ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ observfig ] show the results .",
    "the fp for the observed galaxies can be described as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the velocity width , which we assume to be twice @xmath1 .",
    "the index on @xmath2 is comparable to that given by the models presented above , but the index on @xmath106 ( or @xmath1 ) is lower than the model predictions .",
    "this lower value is almost certainly due to observational bias . in order to show this",
    ", we construct a sample with the same model parameters as in the general case ( case iv ) and select model galaxies with the same luminosity and size distributions as the observed sample so as to reproduce the selection effect .",
    "the results are shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of figure 11 .",
    "as one can see , the tf and fp slopes for this sample are quite close to the observed values .",
    "note that the scatter is smaller than that of case iv in figure 5 , indicating the selection effect is important .",
    "as another example , we show in panels ( e ) and ( f ) the results for a sample with the same model parameters as in case ii except that @xmath44 has a random distribution between @xmath107 and @xmath108 and with galaxies also selected according to the observed luminosity and size distributions .",
    "we see that the scatter allowed in @xmath44 ( a factor of two ) is much smaller than that in @xmath7 ( a factor of ten ) , again because disk action reduces tf scatter ( mo & mao 2000 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the scatter in the fp is significantly smaller than that observed .",
    "unfortunately , it is unclear how seriously these discrepancies should be taken .",
    "the bias correction required may be more complicated than what is assumed here .",
    "in particular , the observed sample is for cluster galaxies , and so systematic bias may also arise from some environmental effects which are not modelled in the theory .",
    "in this paper , we use current theory of disk galaxy formation to study whether a fp - like relation is expected for spiral galaxies . after examining in detail how the changes in model parameters affect the scaling relations of disk galaxies , we find that the fundamental properties of disk galaxies are generally concentrated into a plane , with the tf relation representing an almost edge - on view .",
    "we made a systematical search for the third parameter which may correlate with the tf scatter .",
    "we find that the disk scale - length @xmath2 ( or surface brightness ) as the third parameter can effectively reduce the scatter of tf relation , especially that caused by the variations of halo spin and concentration .",
    "the rotation - curve shape as the third parameter can be used to reduce the scatter caused by @xmath7 . for the various cases we analyzed ,",
    "the fps in the @xmath109-space are quite similar and well represented by equation ( [ theplane ] ) .",
    "this relation is consistent with the preliminary results we obtain from observational data .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of using other characteristic velocities [ e.g. @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 instead of @xmath1 as the velocity parameter in the tf and fp relations .",
    "the theory is consistent with the observations that the scatter in the tf relation is generally larger when rotation velocities at larger radii are used .",
    "there are , however , a number of uncertainties in the theoretical model , which must be taken into account when comparing models with observations .",
    "real galaxies may be much more complicated than our simple model implies : galaxy disks may not be perfectly exponential , the mass distribution in dark haloes may be non - spherical and clumpy and so the rotation curves may not be smooth , and the existence of galactic bulges may affect both the rotation curve and the luminosity profile .",
    "furthermore , the assumption of a constant disk mass - to - light ratio ( in the @xmath18-band ) , although consistent with current observations , is clearly unrealistic , because the mass - to - light ratio of a galaxy depends on its star formation history .",
    "none of these issues are easy to resolve , but we hope the present paper can provide some theoretical guidelines for the search of scaling relations for disk galaxies .",

    "<S> current theory of disk galaxy formation is used to study fundamental - plane ( fp ) type of relations for disk galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we examine how the changes in model parameters affect these relations and explore the possibility of using such relations to constrain theoretical models . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of galaxy disks in the space of their fundamental properties are predicted to be concentrated in a plane , with the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation ( a relation between luminosity @xmath0 and maximum rotation velocity @xmath1 ) being an almost edge - on view . using rotation velocities at larger radii generally leads to larger tf scatter . in searching for a third parameter </S>",
    "<S> , we find that both the disk scale - length @xmath2 ( or surface brightness ) and the rotation - curve shape are correlated with the tf scatter . </S>",
    "<S> the fp relation in the @xmath3-space obtained from the theory is @xmath4 , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , consistent with the preliminary result we obtain from observational data . among the model parameters </S>",
    "<S> we probe , variation in any of them can generate significant scatter in the tf relation , but the effects of the spin parameter and halo concentration can be reduced significantly by introducing @xmath2 while the scatter caused by varying @xmath7 ( the ratio between disk mass and halo mass ) is most effectively reduced by introducing the parameters which describes the rotation - curve shape </S>",
    "<S> . the tf and fp relations combined should therefore provide useful constraints on models of galaxy formation .    </S>",
