    "<S> in this paper we give an improvement of the degree of the homogeneous linear recurrence with integer coefficients that exponential sums of symmetric boolean functions satisfy . </S>",
    "<S> this improvement is tight . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the asymptotic behavior of symmetric boolean functions and provide a formula that allows us to determine if a symmetric boolean function is asymptotically not balanced . in particular , when the degree of the symmetric function is a power of two , then the exponential sum is much smaller than @xmath0 . </S>"
