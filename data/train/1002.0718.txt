    "<S> models of the origin of young stars in the galactic centre are facing various problems . </S>",
    "<S> the most promissing scenario of the star formation in a thin self - gravitating disc naturally forms stars on coherently rotating orbits , but it fails to explain origin of several tens of stars that evidently do not belong to any of the disc - like structures in the gc . </S>",
    "<S> one possible solution lies in rather complicated initial conditions , assuming at least two infalling and interacting gas clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we present alternative solution showing that a single thin stellar disc may have given birth to all young stars in the gc . </S>",
    "<S> the outliers are explained as stars that have been stripped from the parent structure due to the gravitational interaction with the gaseous circum - nuclear disc .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate a model of the galactic centre which contains following constituents : * supermassive black hole ( smbh ) * of mass @xmath0 dominates the gravitational field and it is approximated by a fixed keplerian potential . </S>",
    "<S> * circum - nuclear disc ( cnd ) * is modelled by several tens of particles orbiting the smbh in a toroidal structure . </S>",
    "<S> its total mass is not well determined by observations ; we assume @xmath1 orbiting at a characteristic radius of @xmath2 . * </S>",
    "<S> stellar cusp * of mass @xmath3 within @xmath4 is assumed to be spherically symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> we incorporate it by means of a smooth fixed potential . * </S>",
    "<S> young stellar disc * is a set of @xmath5 equal - mass gravitating particles . </S>",
    "<S> initially , they are on circular orbits with nearly colinear angular momenta . </S>",
    "<S> semi - major axes have distribution @xmath6 within the interval @xmath7 .    provided the cnd would be the only perturbation to the smbh s potential , individual stellar orbits would undergo secular evolution . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , orbital eccentricity and inclination would oscillate on the time - scale comparable to the age of the young stars . </S>",
    "<S> these oscillations are considerably damped if additional _ spherically _ symmetric perturbation of the late type stellar cusp is present . </S>",
    "<S> this component , however , does not suppress differential precession of the stellar orbits around the symmetry axis of the cnd . the precession rate can be approximated as @xcite @xmath8 there is a strong dependence of @xmath9 on the semi - major axis and the orbit inclination @xmath10 with respect to the plane of the cnd . </S>",
    "<S> stars at the outer part of the disc and/or stars that are less perpendicular to the cnd undergo faster precession , i.e. the disc becomes warped . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the stellar disc in terms of the normal vectors of the orbits after several myrs of such a differential precession is shown in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dissolve ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified @xcite that such a model of a warped stellar disc is compatible with the observational data available in the literature @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> ; crosses represent their position at @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> coordinate system is aligned with the axis of the cnd . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the picture changes when self - gravity of the stellar disc is taken into account ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dissolve ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that mutual torques of the stellar orbits tend to drive the coherently rotating ` core ' of the disc towards the orientation perpendicular to the cnd . at the same time , two - body relaxation scatters some stars to orbits that undergo fast precession and do not apparently belong to the parent structure after few myrs . </S>",
    "<S> another consequence of the gravitational interaction of the stellar orbits with both the cnd and stellar disc itself is an enhanced growth of orbital eccentricities @xcite . </S>"
