    "the half - life time of the zero - neutrino double - beta ( 0@xmath0 ) decay is related to the neutrino mass by the equation @xmath8^{-1}=g_{0\\nu}(m_f^{0\\nu}-(g_a / g_v)^2m_{gt}^{0\\nu})^2<\\!m_\\nu\\!>^2   \\label{eqno1}.\\ ] ]    here , g@xmath9 is the two - body phase - space factor which includes the coupling constant , @xmath10m@xmath11 is the effective majorana electron neutrino mass , and m@xmath12 and m@xmath13 are the fermi and gamow - teller nuclear matrix elements , respectively .",
    "therefore , extracting the neutrino mass from the measured half - life time requires the knowledge of the 0@xmath0 nuclear matrix elements .",
    "information on the nuclear matrix elements is currently obtained from quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and nuclear shell - model calculations @xcite .",
    "the parameters in these calculations , in particular the strength of the particle - particle interaction g@xmath14 , in turn are adjusted using measured half - life times of single - beta , and more recently , two - neutrino double - beta ( 2@xmath0 ) decay data . because the behavior of g@xmath14 is different for the transition to the ground state compared to transitions to excited states in the daughter nucleus , measuring 2@xmath0 decay to excited final states provides an excellent test of the theoretical calculations @xcite . furthermore , a very interesting possibility is the search for the 0@xmath0 transition to the 0@xmath15 excited state of the daughter nucleus .",
    "this transition provides a clear - cut signature : in addition to the two electrons with a fixed total energy , there are two gamma rays whose energies are strictly fixed as well . in a hypothetical experiment detecting all decay products with high efficiency and sufficient energy and spatial resolution ,",
    "the background can be reduced to nearly zero .",
    "it is quite possible this idea will be used in future large scale 0@xmath0 searches such as majorana @xcite , @xcite , gerda @xcite , @xcite , cuore @xcite , @xcite , or supernemo @xcite,@xcite . in addition , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was stated that the detection of the excited state transition will provide the opportunity of distinguishing between different 0@xmath0 mechanisms , such as light and heavy majorana neutrino exchange or trilinear r - parity breaking mechanisms .",
    "recently it was speculated @xcite that neutrinos may violate the pauli exclusion principle ( pep ) and therefore , at least partly obey bose - einstein statistics ( see also @xcite ) . as a consequence",
    ", neutrinos could form a bose condensate which may account for parts or even all of the dark matter in the universe . as discussed in @xcite the possible violation of the pep",
    "has interesting consequences for 2@xmath0 decay .",
    "it not only modifies the energy and angular distributions of the emitted electrons , but it also strongly affects the 2@xmath0 decay rates to ground and excited states in daughter nuclei . following @xcite , the half - life time ratios for transitions to excited 2@xmath16 states and the 0@xmath16 ground state are by far the most sensitive way of obtaining bounds on the conjecture of a substantial bosonic component to neutrino statistics @xcite . as a result ,",
    "information on the decay rates to excited states is needed to test this new and potentially far - reaching hypothesis .",
    "presently , 2@xmath0 decay has been observed for ten nuclei @xcite , but data for the 2@xmath0 decay to excited final states exist only for @xmath1mo @xcite@xcite and @xmath17nd @xcite .",
    "recently , a new determination of the half - life time of @xmath1mo for the transition to the first excited 0@xmath2 state in @xmath1ru was reported by hornish _",
    "_ @xcite . in addition , limits to higher excited states were also given in @xcite .",
    "these measurements were performed on ground level at tunl using the coincidence technique . in the case of @xmath1mo , the excited 0@xmath2 state of the daughter nucleus @xmath1ru de - excites via the decay sequence 0@xmath18 , emitting two @xmath19 rays in coincidence with energies of e@xmath20=590.8 kev and e@xmath21=539.5 kev .",
    "the tunl - itep @xmath22 decay setup consists of two cylindrical high - purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors with the @xmath22 decay source sandwiched between them .",
    "the hpge detectors are surrounded by a nai(tl ) annulus which in turn is placed inside of a lead - brick enclosure .",
    "the combination of active and passive shielding suppresses the coincidence background to such an extent that successful measurements on ground level are feasible , provided @xmath22 decay source masses of about 1 kg are available and half - life times do not exceed 10@xmath23 years .",
    "the @xmath22 decay source used at tunl was a metallic disk with mass of 1.05 kg , enriched to 98.4% in @xmath1mo .",
    "after counting for 455 days , 22 coincidence events were detected with a continuous background estimated to be 2.5 events .",
    "using the measured efficiency of the detector system , a half - life time of t@xmath3=[6.0@xmath24(stat)@xmath50.6(syst)]@xmath610@xmath7 y was reported in @xcite .",
    "here we report an improved measurement of the coincidence efficiency of the tunl - itep @xmath22 decay apparatus , and new data taken for @xmath1mo during 450 days of counting .",
    "we closely followed the procedure described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the radioactive source used to measure the efficiency was @xmath25rh , which was produced at tunl via the reaction @xmath25ru(p , n)@xmath25rh initiated with 5 mev incident protons on a natural ruthenium target ( 31.6% @xmath25ru ) .",
    "this particular source was chosen for several reasons .",
    "first , the 0@xmath18 decay sequence not only results in @xmath19 rays in coincidence , but also mimics the decay scheme of the excited final 0@xmath2 state of @xmath1mo .",
    "therefore , corrections for the angular distribution are unnecessary . the associated @xmath19 ray  energies , 468.6 kev and 475.1 kev , are also close to those of @xmath1ru ( 539.5 kev and 590.8 kev ) , the daughter nucleus of @xmath1mo . finally , the 205.1 @xmath5 1.9 day half - life of @xmath25rh is long enough to allow shorter lived contaminants to decay away prior to measurement .",
    "the activity of the source was determined by comparing the intensity of the 475.1 kev @xmath19ray peak to that of the 661.6 kev @xmath19ray peak from a calibrated @xmath26cs source .",
    "the hpge detectors of @xcite were 8.8 cm in diameter and 5.0 cm in thickness . because the @xmath1mo source used for the measurement of the half - life time in @xcite and in our work described in sec .",
    "3 was in form of a 10.6 cm diameter and 1.1 cm thick disk , the radial dependence of the 468.6 kev -",
    "475.1 kev coincidence efficiency across the detector faces was crucial .",
    "we sandwiched our 1 @xmath6 1 @xmath6 0.5 mm@xmath27 ruthenium / rhodium source ( in the following referred to as @xmath25rh source ) between ten disks ( five on each side ) of 10 cm diameter and 0.1 cm thickness of natural molybdenum to ensure that the overall thickness was the same as in the original 2@xmath0 decay experiment on @xmath1mo .",
    "this procedure yields the same average @xmath19ray attenuation provided the energy difference between the @xmath19ray pairs ( 468.6 kev -",
    "475.1 kev versus 539.5 kev -",
    "590.8 kev ) is properly taken into account .",
    "furthermore , it enables the @xmath25rh source to be positioned not only at different radii , but also at different locations along the _ z _ axis , _ i.e. _ , along the common axis of the two hpge detectors .",
    "the previous coincidence efficiency measurement @xcite was made along the radius @xmath28 on the front faces of the hpge detectors at the four locations @xmath28=0 , 2 , 4 and 5 cm , _",
    "i.e. _ , in only one direction , assuming cylindrical symmetry of the detectors .",
    "the current measurements were performed across the entire diameter and in two perpendicular directions , _",
    "i.e. _ , horizontally and vertically .",
    "near the center we used 0.5 cm increments to better determine the efficiency in that region .",
    "a total of 25 data points were obtained in this manner between -4.5 cm @xmath29 _ r _ @xmath29 4.5 cm with the @xmath25rh source sandwiched between two 0.5 cm ",
    "thick molybdenum disks .",
    "the measuring time for each data point varied between 12 and 48 hours , always obtaining at least 8000 coincidence events . at each location of the @xmath25rh source the number of 468.6 kev ",
    "475.1 kev coincidences was determined from the two  dimensional data area of pulse height in hpge detector 1 versus pulse height in hpge detector 2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2denergy ] ) .",
    "the data were analyzed using the root c / c++ interpreter .",
    "the program used gates and projections ( see fig . [",
    "fig : proj ] ) along the axes to set close gates around the coincidence peaks and , after background subtraction , obtained the yields in each peak .",
    "the time normalized yields were then corrected for dead time ( @xmath103% ) and normalized to the activity of the @xmath25rh source , taking into account its half - life .",
    "we measured this half - life independently and determined it to be 203.3 @xmath5 2.8 days .",
    "combined with an existing world average of 206.7 @xmath5 2.6 days from @xcite@xcite , we obtained a half life of 205.1 @xmath5 1.9 days . in order to obtain the efficiency for the @xmath1mo 2@xmath0 decay to the 0@xmath2 state of @xmath1ru the yields had to be corrected not only for the difference in attenuation between the @xmath25rh and @xmath1ru @xmath19ray lines of interest , but also for the energy dependent detection efficiency of our two identical hpge detectors .",
    "for that purpose , the relative detection efficiency was measured with a @xmath30eu source .    as has been expected , the radial dependence of the coincidence efficiency was almost identical for the horizontal and vertical scans , within error associated with the exact location of the @xmath25rh source .",
    "figure [ fig : cavg ] shows the average of the horizontal and vertical efficiencies as a function of _ r_. the error bars represent the statistical uncertainty of the data . here",
    ", the effect of the position uncertainty of the @xmath25rh source is added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the coincidence efficiency is rather small , close to 0.4% in the -1 cm @xmath10 _ r _ @xmath10 1 cm range and then dropping smoothly to about 0.1% at _",
    "r_=4 cm . as a result , only about 3% of our @xmath1mo disk provides 2@xmath0 decay related @xmath19 rays with the maximum detection efficiency .",
    "however , about 30% of the disk provides @xmath19 rays with an efficiency of 50% of the maximum efficiency obtained at @xmath28=0 cm .    the curve through the data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : cavg ] is a least - square fit using the functional form @xmath31    where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are free parameters and _ r_=0 refers to the center on the front face of the hpge detectors .",
    "a careful inspection reveals a slight asymmetry in the coincidence efficiency , providing slightly larger values for _",
    "the lower ( dashed ) and upper ( dashed - dotted ) curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cavg ] represent our systematic uncertainty of 5.1% , including the @xmath53% scale uncertainty associated with the @xmath26cs @xmath19-ray source .    the radial contribution to the coincidence efficiency",
    "was calculated using    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the best fit obtained from an asymmetric fit to the data .",
    "this value is then corrected by the _",
    "z_-dependence of the coincidence efficiency measured in the present work and confirmed by monte - carlo simulation , where _ z _ is the distance from the face of the detector .",
    "there is a 10% decrease in efficiency at the center of the 1 cm thick molybdenum disk compared to the front and back faces .",
    "the resulting efficiency value is @xmath37=(0.182@xmath50.009)% , where the total uncertainty of 5.1% is due to the contributions listed in table [ tab : error ] .",
    "they include an estimated 3% uncertainty due to the slightly irregular shape of our @xmath1mo disk .",
    "the previous measurements described in @xcite provided @xmath37=(0.219@xmath50.022)% .",
    "the associated data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : effcomp ] in comparison with a fit to the present data ( solid curve ) .",
    "the main reason for the difference between the previous and the present value is due to an improved determination of the _ z_-dependence of the efficiency .",
    "the improvement by a factor of 2.4 in the determination of the coincidence efficiency for the @xmath38 decay apparatus of @xcite justifies reducing the statistical uncertainty of t@xmath3=[6.0@xmath24(stat ) @xmath50.6(syst ) ] @xmath6 10@xmath7 y obtained in @xcite for the half - life time of @xmath1mo for the transition to the first excited 0@xmath2 state in @xmath1ru . only in the very recent result of the nemo group of t@xmath3=[5.7@xmath39 ( stat ) @xmath5 0.8",

    "however , in order for 2@xmath0 decay half - life time measurements to the 0@xmath2 state to play a decisive role in testing nuclear matrix element calculations , statistical and systematic accuracies each approaching the @xmath405% level are needed for @xmath1mo .    in an attempt to approach this level of accuracy also for the statistical uncertainty",
    ", we report in this section on a new result of our ongoing measurement of t@xmath3 for @xmath1mo to the 0@xmath2 state in @xmath1ru . the part of the level scheme of @xmath1ru which is of interest to the present work is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : level ] . because the approach and analysis procedures are the same as those described in @xcite , only the essential facts are given here .",
    "after 450 days of data taking we recorded 16.0 @xmath5 4.4 net coincidence events after subtraction of 0.45 @xmath5 0.16 background events per kev .",
    "this result can be compared to the 19.5 @xmath5 4.7 net events reported in @xcite for 455 days of data taking .",
    "figure [ fig : events ] shows the energy spectra for the 539.5 kev and 590.8 kev transitions obtained in the present work , while fig .",

    "we have no indication that the efficiency of the tunl 2@xmath0 decay apparatus has changed between the data of @xcite and the present data were accumulated .",
    "therefore , we used our newly determined coincidence efficiency for the data of @xcite and obtained t@xmath3=[5.0@xmath42 ( stat ) @xmath5 0.3 ( syst)]@xmath610@xmath7 y. combining this result with our present result gives t@xmath3=[5.5@xmath4 ( stat ) @xmath5 0.3 ( syst)]@xmath610@xmath7 y. this value is in agreement with the recommended value of barabash @xcite for the decay of @xmath1mo to the 0@xmath2 state in @xmath1ru of t@xmath3=6.2@xmath43@xmath610@xmath7 y. using the phase - space factor value g@xmath44=1.64 @xmath6 10@xmath45 y@xmath46 ( for g@xmath47 = 1.254 ) and the measured half - life , one obtains the nuclear matrix element value for the 2@xmath0 transition m@xmath44(0@xmath15)=0.105 @xmath5 0.010 ( scaled by the electron rest mass ) .    because the technique used in @xcite and in the present work does not allow a distinction between 0@xmath0 and 2@xmath0 decay , strictly speaking , our result for t@xmath3 is the sum of the 0@xmath0 and 2@xmath0 decay half - life times .",
    "however , the experimental limit for the 0@xmath0 decay to the 0@xmath16 ground state of @xmath1ru is about three orders of magnitude larger @xcite than the value reported here for t@xmath48 .",
    "therefore , considering the reduced phase space available for the transition to the excited 0@xmath2 state , it is safe to assume that our result for t@xmath3 refers solely to the 2@xmath0 decay .",
    "additionally , theoretical estimates for 0@xmath0 decay to this level for a neutrino mass of 1 ev are many orders of magnitude higher : ( 7.6 - 14.6 ) @xmath6 10@xmath49 y @xcite and 2.6 @xmath6 10@xmath50 y @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the half - life ratio , @xmath51 was calculated for @xmath1mo using the single - state dominance approach of @xcite and applying different scenarios for neutrino statistics . for purely fermionic neutrinos",

    "although this ratio seems to favor the hypothesis of bosonic neutrinos , a more accurate half - life time for the 0@xmath15 transition is needed to draw any definite conclusions .",
