    "-.35 cm the faraday rotation effect is observed against the polarised radio emission of extragalactic radio sources traveling through the icm , revealing magnetic fields of @xmath0100kpc  scale threading this media .",
    "rm maps indicate that cluster magnetic fields ( cmfs ) have a random structure with more power on larger scales , their strength seems to be of order @xmath1 g and proportional to both the icm density distribution and the cluster cooling flow related accretion rates ( carilli & taylor  @xcite ) .",
    "the origin , evolution and role of cmfs on the icm stability are open questions .",
    "also , since agn jets have strong effects on the icm , it is not clear to what extent , and how , they affect both the cmfs and their rm characterisation . we investigate this in huarte - espinosa , krause & alexander  @xcite .",
    "-.35 cm using flash  3.1 ( fryxell et al .",
    "@xcite ) we solve the equations of mhd with a constrained transport scheme ( lee & deaane  @xcite ) in a cubic cartesian domain with .",
    "the icm is implemented as a monoatomic ideal gas ( @xmath2 ) with a density profile of @xmath3 in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium with central gravity .",
    "magnetic fields in the grid are set up with a kolmogorov - like structure ( following murgia et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the thermal over magnetic pressure ratio is of order unity everywhere",
    ". the plasma relaxes for one crossing time and then we inject mass and @xmath4-momentum into a central control cylinder , in a back - to - back fashion .",
    "we experiment with the jets power using velocities of 40 , 80  and 130  mach , and densities of 0.02@xmath5 and 0.004@xmath5 .",
    "-.35 cm we calculate rm@xmath6 812 @xmath7 radm@xmath8 from the jets cavity contact discontinuity to the end of the domain , along different viewing angles .",
    "we do this at different times , with and without the jets to assess their effects on the cmfs .",
    "the fields in the region between the cocoon and the bow shock are compressed , stretched and amplified . in figure  1",
    "we show the case of jets velocity and density of 130  mach and 0.004@xmath5 , respectively , at a viewing angle of 45@xmath9 .",
    "we see that the jets with mach@xmath10\\{80 , 130 } are able to to increase the icm magnetic energy energy in proportion to the jet velocity . though the rm structure functions show and preserve the cmfs initial condition , they are flattened by the jets at scales of order tens of kpc .",
    "this scale is larger for sources with fat cocoons ,    r0.63    i.e. light densities .",
    "we calculate the mean rm for the approaching and the receding radio lobes vs. the viewing angle .",
    "intrinsically , the depolarisation is always higher for the receding lobe ; i.e. the laing - garrington effect ( laing  @xcite )",
    ". this however is only moderately affected by the radio source expansion , in such a way that the associated trends tend to be amplified .",
    "-.35 cm the jets distort and amplify the cmfs , especially near the edges of the lobes and the jets heads . @xmath11rm@xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 increase in proportion to the jets power .",
    "the effect may lead to overestimations of the cmfs strength by about 70% .",
    "a flattening of the rm structure functions is produced by the jets , at scales comparable to the source size .",
    "jet - produced rm enhancements are more apparent in quasars than in radio galaxies .",
