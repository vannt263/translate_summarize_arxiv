    "chaos in monomode @xmath0 lasers with an intracavity molecular gas as saturable absorber , @xmath1 , has been observed @xcite and modeled by a three level system to represent the amplifier and a two level system for the absorber @xcite .",
    "a passive q - switching of the laser cavity is produced by the saturation of the absorber and , for appropriate relaxation and saturation rates , the laser oscillates with periodic or chaotic pulse emission .",
    "the dynamical system behavior is explained as due to the approach to a homoclinic tangency to a saddle focus @xcite , or to an unstable periodic orbit @xcite , depending on the operating parameters of the system .",
    "this work presents numerical solutions of the laser model giving the dynamical bifurcations as it approaches a homoclinic orbit to an unstable cycle which consists of a high spike pulse and an infinite number of undulations .",
    "bifurcations diagrams are usually exhibited by giving the peak of the pulses and here they are given by the average power of the laser .",
    "the properties of the average power throughout the bifurcations are the main results reported .",
    "introduced by tachikawa _ et al _ @xcite and thoroughly analyzed by many authors the @xmath2 level model for the @xmath1 predicts most dynamical observations made in these lasers . the mean intracavity intensity @xmath3 , the mean gain medium population inversion @xmath4 , the effective ground state population depletion of the gain medium , @xmath5 , and the mean population difference of the absorber @xmath6 , are the four independent variables for the rate equations in the model . it can be shown @xcite that the lsa system may be reduced to a three dimensional flux as one considers the usual fast relaxation of the absorber @xcite , and",
    "adiabatically eliminates the variable @xmath6 .",
    "the three level - two level rate equations describing the @xmath1 with the normalized variables explained above are @xcite : @xmath7 \\\\ \\dot{w } & = & \\epsilon \\ ; \\left ( a + b u - w \\right ) \\\\",
    "\\dot{\\overline{u } } & = & \\overline{\\epsilon } \\ ; \\left [ \\overline{a } - \\overline{u } \\left ( 1 + a i \\right ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameters in the equations are : @xmath8 and @xmath9 the relaxation rates of the amplifier and absorber , respectively , normalized to the cavity relaxation rate ( which is the inverse time unit ) . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the pumping rates in the amplifier and absorber population differences , respectively , normalized to the cavity loss .",
    "the coefficient @xmath12 is the difference between the population relaxation rates of lower and upper level of the gain transition , normalized to the sum of these relaxation rates .",
    "the saturability coefficient for the absorber , normalized to the two level saturability of the gain , is @xmath13 .",
    "more detailed explanation of these dimensionless quantities and the physical behavior contained in eqs .",
    "( 1)-(4 ) are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the flux described by those equations was studied by lefranc _",
    "@xcite who calculated bifurcations diagrams typical of homoclinic chaos .",
    "generally each laser pulse has a leading spike , named the reinjection , and @xmath14 small undulations in a tail associated to the cycling around the unstable orbit to be reached at the homoclinic tangency .",
    "the notation is then @xmath15 for the pulses with @xmath16 undulations and the periodic regime made with such pulses and @xmath17 for the chaotic pulsation composed of irregular occurrence of pulses @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "the maxima in the spike and the undulations of a long train of pulses can be registered to indicate the dynamical state of the lsa .",
    "a bifurcation diagram consists of a plot of the maxima in the pulses emitted versus the control parameter @xmath10 , which is the pump rate of the laser .",
    "the bifurcations , as shown in figure @xmath20 , consist of alternating periodic - chaotic windows well predicted @xcite in the homoclinic chaos of lsa . at certain chosen parameters",
    "they also show long sequences windows separated by periodic to periodic global bifurcations from a regime @xmath15 to a @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the average of a dynamical variable in a nonlinear flux or map may manifest some of its bifurcations @xcite .",
    "such property has been pointed out in the early days of studies of chaotic maps @xcite .",
    "it is our purpose here to verify how such average behaves in a flux associated to a laser system where experimental tests are feasible @xcite .",
    "the parameters used to numerically solve equations ( 1 - 4 ) were : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the control parameter @xmath10 was varied between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the bifurcation diagram showing the maxima of the pulses is given in figure @xmath20 .",
    "et al _ @xcite have discussed this diagram in details . at each position of @xmath10 @xmath29 maxima",
    "are saved from the numerical integration done with a standard fourth order runge - kutta routine .",
    "the calculation at each of the @xmath30 steps of @xmath10 had as initial condition the last values from the previous step . for low gain , i.e. small @xmath10 ,",
    "the laser shows periodic pulsation with spike pulses @xmath31 which bifurcates into periodic pulsation of one undulation pulses .",
    "this global bifurcation consists in a transition that generally has bistability .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath10 gives a cusp bifurcation from periodic @xmath32 into chaotic @xmath33 pulsation .",
    "the chaotic window ends at a tangent bifurcation , when the system recovers periodic pulsation @xmath34 .",
    "this @xmath34 window develops a cascade of period doubling bifurcations into @xmath35 chaos and so on .",
    "the succession of windows is one of the signatures of the homoclinic chaos . at @xmath36 an inverse cascade of period doubling leads the system to a hopf bifurcation connected to the continuous wave laser operation , when the fixed point @xmath37 is stable .",
    "figure @xmath38 shows the average power of the laser calculated in same range of variation of the control parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the transient at each step of the calculation , which is very important near the bifurcation points , was eliminated , as far as possible within computation time , by neglecting the first @xmath39 time units in a total of @xmath40 time units of integration .",
    "it can be seen that the most important manifestation of the bifurcations in the average occur at the periodic to periodic transition and at the hopf bifurcation .",
    "the average suffers a discontinuity at the periodic to periodic transitions .",
    "such discontinuity also occurs at the hopf bifurcation , when the parameters make this a supercritical one . at the period doubling and at the tangent",
    "bifurcations the changes in the average are not visible in the scale resolution of figure @xmath41 . to search for the average variations on these bifurcations a refined calculation",
    "was done over the period doubling and the tangent bifurcation around the @xmath42 chaotic window , as shown in figure @xmath43 . the period doubling bifurcation remains without changes for the average . at these bifurcations the only expected changes on the average",
    "is in one of its derivative with respect to the control parameter .",
    "for the flux studies here no derivative discontinuity was obtained to the resolution of the calculation .",
    "conversely a first derivative discontinuity is obtained , analytically and numerically , for the average of one dimensional maps at period doubling bifurcations @xcite .",
    "figure @xmath43 shows a bifurcation diagram for the average still with the same parameters of figure @xmath44 , but spanning a very narrower range of @xmath10 at the onset of the tangent bifurcation from chaotic regime @xmath42 to periodic @xmath45 .",
    "similar behavior occur for the other tangent bifurcations . to fit the dependence of the average @xmath46 on @xmath10",
    "the expression @xmath47 was used , with the values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 extracted from inspection of the numerical diagram near the @xmath50 bifurcation .",
    "a best fitting of eq .",
    "( 5 ) to the data is shown in figure @xmath51 in a log - log graph .",
    "the dots are the numerical calculation and the line corresponds to the fitting which verifies that the average decreases following a power law whose exponent is @xmath52 .",
    "the other tangent bifurcation in the diagram seems to have the same exponent but a detailed study was not pursued .",
    "bifurcation diagrams associated to the homoclinic tangency to an unstable periodic orbit in the 3 - 2 level model for a laser with saturable absorber were calculated numerically .",
    "the numerical solutions were used to calculate the average power emitted by the chaotic laser .",
    "it was verified that the average power has a discontinuous change on the cusp bifurcations , related to the bistability between different periodic regimes . through period doubling bifurcations , no change of the average power",
    "was obtained .",
    "the tangent bifurcations from chaos into periodic pulsation show a characteristic average power dependence , similar to the averages observed on the logistic map @xcite , with a critical exponent 1/2 .",
    "preliminary experiments observing bifurcations in the average power of a @xmath0 laser with @xmath53 as saturable absorber have been done @xcite and the verification of the properties of critical exponents on the tangent bifurcations is under development @xcite . characterizing dynamical bifurcations by averages , which can be measured experimentally by slow detectors , may be useful to study ultra fast chaotic systems .",
