    "since the first confirmed detection of a brown dwarf in 1995 @xcite , a substantial effort has been made on characterizing substellar objects . up to now , almost 2000 isolated brown dwarfs have been discovered , and we are beginning to better understand their formation and evolution . nevertheless , the modeling of their cool atmospheres , bearing several molecules and dust clouds , is a great challenge for modern astrophysics .",
    "several low - mass substellar companions ( @xmath1130@xmath10 ) have been discovered recently on wide orbits ( @xmath1280au ) around stars , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "the age and distance of these companions can be inferred from their primary star , while their large separation permits their direct observation without the hampering glare of their primary star ; their characterization is thus particularly interesting for testing low temperature atmosphere and evolution models . at young ages",
    "these companions are even more interesting as this is where an empirical verification of the theoretical models is most needed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these young companions are potentially ( more massive ) analogs to the young giant planets recently imaged @xcite , and thus can serve as workbenches in support of the more difficult direct imaging studies of exoplanets .",
    "in this paper we present and analyze new near - infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations of a sample of three wide substellar companions to young stars in the upper  scorpius ob ( usco ) formation region : the @xmath1316@xmath10  companion at a separation of @xmath13320au around the k7 star gsc  06214 - 00210 ( hereafter g06214 ; @xcite ) , the @xmath1323@xmath10  companion at 740au from the b9 star hip  78530 @xcite , and the @xmath1334@xmath10  companion at @xmath13885au from the k7 star [ pgz2001 ]  j161031.9191305 ( hereafter j16101913 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the primary of j16101913 is itself a tight binary ( aab , separation of @xmath130145 or @xmath1320au , @xcite ) , in which the companion ( ab ) is roughly at the stellar / substellar boundary .",
    "we also apply the same analysis , using existing data , to the @xmath138@xmath10  companion at 330au around the k7 star 1rxs  j160929.1210524 ( hereafter j16092105 ) that was first identified in @xcite and further analyzed in @xcite .",
    "usco is located at a distance of @xmath14pc @xcite and the average age in the region is estimated at 5myr , with a very small scatter ( @xmath15myr ) @xcite .",
    "it is thus reasonable to consider a common age for the systems in our sample , meaning that on a comparative basis , the companions should not be affected by the age - mass degeneracy inherent to substellar objects .",
    "the initial age estimate of 5myr for usco was recently revised to 11@xmath72myr by @xcite , based on isochrone fitting .",
    "this new age seems to be consistent with the results of @xcite , given recent the revision of the age of the beta pictoris moving group proposed by @xcite .",
    "still , the exact age of usco is still the subject of debate , and is beyond the scope of this paper , so in our work below we present results assuming both estimates .",
    "the four companions studied in this paper have all been studied to various degrees in earlier publications .",
    "the near - infrared photometry and spectroscopy of hip  78530  b was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied hip  78530  b , g06214  b , and j16092105  b using 35@xmath0 m photometry . @xcite",
    "presented 1.11.8@xmath0 m spectroscopy of g06214  b , adding to the @xmath16 photometry from @xcite .",
    "the latter study also independently confirmed the common proper motion of j16092105  b. j16101913  b was observed in the @xmath17 band by @xcite , who made its discovery .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a low resolution ( @xmath18 ) 0.82.5@xmath0 m spectrum and @xmath4- and @xmath19-band photometric measurements of j16101913  b. in this paper , in addition to carrying out a homogeneous analysis of the four companions , with a focus on a comparison of their spectra with those of atmosphere models , we also present new data .",
    "we present the first photometric measurements in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath6 of j16101913  b. for hip  78530  b , the @xmath2-band photometry and the 0.901.15@xmath0 m spectrum have never been published before .",
    "the spectrum of g06214  b in the @xmath19 band is also presented for the first time , along with the part of the @xmath3 band between 1.00@xmath0 m and 1.18@xmath0 m , where the vo band and the and the two first lines are found .",

    "the primary stars themselves were used for wavefront sensing and the altair field lens was used to reduce the effects of anisoplanatism and achieve better image quality at separations of a few arc seconds .",
    "the @xmath21 camera was used , resulting in a pixel scale of @xmath22 and a field of view of @xmath23 .",
    "the cassegrain rotator was turned off during the observations , to match the setup used for earlier observations of the same stars , and thus the field of view orientation changed slowly during the sequences . for hip  78530",
    ", we took observations with the @xmath2 filter , to complement similar observations made previously in @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath24  and initially reported in @xcite .",
    "we also obtained observations of hip  78530 in the narrowband @xmath25 filter ( 2.0975@xmath0 m ) for astrometric follow up as observations at three earlier epochs had already been obtained in this filter . for gsc  06214 and j16101913 , we took images with the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath24  filters .",
    "the observation log is presented in table  [ tbl : obs ] .    for all targets we used a pattern of five dither positions consisting of the centre and corners of a square of @xmath26 on one side . for most observations ,",
    "the primary is too bright to get a good signal from the companion without saturating the detector . to obtain deeper images allowing more precise photometry of the companions",
    ", we thus obtained , at each dither position , a set comprising unsaturated images consisting of multiple co - additions of short integrations in fast , high read - noise mode , followed by one saturated image consisting of one long integration in slow , low read - noise mode .",
    "the saturated images can be readily registered to the unsaturated images and easily corrected in the saturated part using the properly scaled unsaturated images .",
    "we also observed hip  78530 and j16101913 in @xmath6 , still with the @xmath21 camera but without the use of ao .",
    "we observed the faint photometric standard star fs  140 @xcite shortly after the targets to calibrate the @xmath6  photometric measurements .",
    "for these observations , we used a pattern of five @xmath27 nod pairs with a separation of 8 , each pair being displaced from the preceding one by 2 . at each position we obtained 12 co - additions with an integration time of 0.75  s each , ensuring that the primary star was never saturated .",
    "this sequence was repeated three times for hip  78530 , with a pattern rotation of @xmath28 between each sequence . for j16101913 ,",
    "the sequence was executed only once .",
    "we reduced the data using custom idl routines .",
    "for the images obtained in the high read - noise mode , a striped noise pattern was often present and we removed it by proper median filtering .",
    "for the images taken in @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath19 , we constructed a sky frame by taking the median of the images at all dither positions , after masking out the sources in each one .",
    "for the images in @xmath6 , we built the sky frame as the mean of the two images obtained at the preceding and following dither positions ( also after masking out the sources ) .",
    "after subtraction of the sky frame , we divided the images by a normalized flat field , and we corrected the geometric distortion of the images using the prescription given on the instrument webpage .",
    ", where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the uncorrected distance from the field centre in pixels , and @xmath31 is the corrected distance from the centre in pixels . from http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/instruments/niri/imaging/pixel-scales-and-fov . ]",
    "the reduced images at each dither position were then registered to place the primary star at their centre , de - rotated to a common field orientation , and their median was taken .",
    "the saturated region of the long - exposure images were finally replaced by the properly scaled unsaturated images . for improved consistency among all of our targets , we reprocessed the archival @xmath3- , @xmath4- and @xmath19-band data for hip  78530  b @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopy observations were made at the gemini north telescope in the same program as the imaging , using the gnirs spectrograph @xcite in cross - dispersed ( xd ) spectroscopy mode with a @xmath32-wide slit , the 10 lines mm@xmath33 grating and the long blue camera with its lxd prism , resulting in a coverage from 0.885@xmath0 m to 2.425@xmath0 m , see observation log in table  [ tbl : obs ] .",
    "the altair ao system was also used to improve the spatial resolution and image quality , and thus greatly reduce the contamination from the bright nearby primary at the position of the companion . given the wide slit used , the spectral resolving power achieved is determined by the width of the ao - corrected point - spread function ( psf ) ( @xmath13140190mas ) and varied between 900 and 1300 depending on target and wavelength .",
    "we obtained three exposures of 100 to 360 s integration , depending on the source , at each of two nod positions along the slit ( for sky subtraction ) .",
    "we observed the a0 telluric standard star  hd  151787 @xcite immediately after each target to determine and correct for the effect of the atmospheric and instrumental transmissions .",
    "observatory standard calibration data ( flat field , arc lamps ) were obtained with each observation .",
    "we reduced the data using custom idl routines .",
    "first , we subtracted the exposures taken at two different nods in the slit to remove the majority of the background signal , resulting in parallel positive and negative signal traces .",
    "we then divided the frames by a normalized flat field , using a different lamp in the @xmath19 band than for the rest of the spectrum for saturation considerations .",
    "a few frames also presented a noise pattern of stripes that was removed by carefully applying 1d iterative median filtering for each quadrant separately .",
    "we then rectified the traces of each order using cubic interpolation .",
    "we next corrected a slight spectral shearing by rectifying atmospheric lines that were apparent on the frames before subtracting the two nod positions .",
    "with ao , the shape of the psf is wavelength dependent .",
    "we thus fitted the trace independently for each spectral pixel along the spectrum .",
    "we fitted an analytic trace consisting of the sum of a gaussian profile for its core and a moffat profile for the wings . while fitting for the trace , we simultaneously fitted ( and removed ) the potential contribution from the primary star and any residual background signal",
    "the contamination from the primary depends on the contrast and separation of the companion and is most important for g06214  b , with only @xmath132  separation .",
    "the flux from each nod position , cleaned from contamination and residual background signal , was extracted separately using the fitted trace as weight ; the flux from the two positions were then summed together .",
    "the wavelengths were calibrated using an ar arc lamp exposure and the different orders of the spectrum were combined by adjusting their overlapping sections .",
    "then , we divided the target spectra by the total transmission function .",
    "the latter was determined from the spectrum of the telluric standard .",
    "namely , the continuum of the standard star spectrum was modelled by a black body function and removed , while its hydrogen absorption lines were fitted by a voigt profile over the appropriate wavelength ranges , and then divided out .",
    "the median of all individual spectra was taken as the final spectrum and their dispersion was used to estimate the uncertainties .",
    "based on the achieved psf fwhm , the effective resolving power in the @xmath4 band for the different spectra were @xmath34 for hip  78530  b , @xmath35 for g06214  b and @xmath36 for j16101913  b.",
    "for each system , the position of the primary and companion was measured by fitting an elongated 2d gaussian function to their psf . for saturated psfs ,",
    "the position from the preceding unsaturated frame was used . the flux ratio between the companion and primary",
    "was calculated using aperture photometry , with an aperture radius set to the radius at which the radial intensity profile of the companion falls below the @xmath37 background noise level .",
    "the contribution of the primary star flux inside the photometry aperture of the companion was estimated , and removed , in the following manner .",
    "first , an azimuthally symmetric median radial intensity profile of the central star was calculated and subtracted from the image .",
    "then a similar profile was calculated for the companion in the residual image , and this profile was subtracted from the original image .",
    "this process was then repeated once to ensure that the radial profile of the primary was not biased by the companion .",
    "the flux measurement for the companion was performed on the original image to which we subtracted the modelled flux of the primary star , while the measurement for the primary was made on the original image minus the modelled flux of the companion .",
    "these measurements were performed on the combined images as well as on the individually reduced frames .",
    "the uncertainties on the separation , position angle and photometry of the companions were determined from the scatter of measurements from individual frames .",
    "the pixel scale , @xmath38  pixel@xmath39 , was taken from the instrument manual and the direction towards north was taken from the image headers . by comparing our 2011 measurements with measurements of the same systems made at earlier epochs , we noticed that our position angle values were systematically off by @xmath40 , based on previous measurements on 3 targets ; we thus corrected our measurements for this systematic offset and included it in the position angle errors .",
    "the flux ratios between the primaries and companions are given in table  [ tbl : deltaphot ] , along with their angular separations and position angles .",

    "this result is significantly higher than the previous value , but it comes with a large uncertainty and the two values can be reconciled .",
    "the mass of the close binary j16101913  ab seems to be in the stellar regime using both methods .",
    "our homogeneous comparison between the observed spectra of young substellar companions in usco and synthetic spectra from the bt - settl and drift - phoenix models has revealed some interesting and systematic trends .",
    "first , the models do not succeed in reproducing the details of the spectra across the 12.4@xmath0 m range simultaneously . as noted by @xcite in the case of early l - type dwarfs in the field ,",
    "the best fit in the individual bands typically occur for models of different temperatures . at the temperatures providing the best fits in the @xmath3 and @xmath19 bands , the synthetic spectra have significantly steeper slopes in @xmath4 than the observed spectra , both at the blue and red ends .",
    "an even more evident feature that is not reproduced by the models is the vo band in @xmath3 .",
    "the vo absorption band at 1.06@xmath0 m is only reproduced by the drift - phoenixs models , and generally only at a temperature slightly lower than the temperature leading to the best fit in other parts of the @xmath3 band .",
    "the bt - settl models simply fail to reproduce this vo feature at any reasonable range of @xmath96  and @xmath206 .",
    "similar conclusions about the vo feature and the fit of the @xmath4 band for the bt - settl models were reported by @xcite .",
    "the alkali and lines in the observed spectra are systematically stronger than in the models .",
    "note however that we have not carefully investigated the effect of metallicity on these features .",
    "the excellent agreement of the spectra of free floating bd in upper scorpius with our spectra ( see figure  [ fig : compare ] ) provides yet another argument that the above trends are common features of young bds and point to a real shortcoming of the models .",
    "also , the best temperature estimates obtained by matching the broadband magnitudes and colors of the objects to synthetic magnitudes from the models are systematically lower , by @xmath13200k on average , than the temperatures obtained from band - by - band comparisons of the spectra with models .",
    "this is also the case for the spectral fit applied globally ( simultaneously across the near - infrared range ) , as it too is affected by the broad band colors .    beyond their use for testing atmosphere and evolution models ,",
    "the wide low - mass substellar companions studied here are of high interest for the study of planet and star formation . in principle",
    ", such low mass companions could form like stars , through the collapse and fragmentation of a pre - stellar core , or as planets within a circumstellar disk , but their combination of low mass and wide separation poses a challenge to both processes . a formation in - situ within the circumstellar disk of the primary",
    "would require an unusually large disk , but a formation within a disk closer to the primary followed by outward migration ( from dynamical interactions ) would be possible .",
    "the low - mass substellar companions studied here have a mass representing only 0.754% of the mass of their primaries .",
    "if these companions actually formed like stars , then it would imply that the fragmentation process can produce objects having only about 1% of the mass of the primary star . in any case",
    ", further observations of these systems using high - contrast imaging techniques and radial velocity to search for additional companions would be useful to help understand their origin . for example",
    ", if they formed within a disk and were ejected outward , then a more massive object would likely reside in the system at a much smaller separation .",
