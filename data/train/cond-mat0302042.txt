    "recently , there has been a renewed experimental interest in the exotic one - electron and two - electron spectral properties of quasi - one - dimensional materials @xcite .",
    "some of these experimental studies observed unusual finite - energy / frequency spectral properties , which are far from being well understood . for values of the excitation energy larger than the transfer integrals associated with electron hopping between the chains , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard model @xcite is expected to provide a good description of the physics of these materials @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent angle - resolved ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy revealed very similar spectral fingerprints from both high-@xmath0 superconductors and quasi - one - dimensional compounds @xcite .",
    "the similarity of the ultraviolet data for these two different systems could be evidence of the occurrence of a charge - spin separation associated with holons and spinons .",
    "the anomalous temperature dependence of the spectral function could also indicate a dimensional crossover @xcite .",
    "the results of refs .",
    "@xcite also suggest that the unconventional spectral properties observed in two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials could have a 1d origin .",
    "thus the holons and spinons could play an important role in spectral properties of both 1d and 2d low - dimensional materials .",
    "the present study is related the to both the investigations of refs . @xcite and @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite the non - perturbative organization of the @xmath1 electrons and @xmath2 $ ] electronic holes , which results from the many - electron interactions , was studied . in that paper",
    "it was found that all energy eigenstates of the model can be described in terms of occupancy configurations of @xmath3 holons , @xmath4 spinons , and @xmath5 pseudoparticles where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are @xmath8-spin and spin projections respectively .",
    "moreover , the @xmath9 pseudoparticles ( and @xmath10 pseudoparticles ) associated with takahasi s charge ( and spin ) ideal string excitations of length @xmath11 @xcite were found to be @xmath8-spin singlet @xmath12-holon ( and spin singlet @xmath12-spinon ) composite quantum objects .",

    "@xcite that the charge excitations associated with the @xmath5 pseudoparticles are independent of the @xmath8-spin - holon and spin - spinon excitations . moreover , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite reveal that the above quantum objects can be expressed in terms of _ rotated electrons_. according to these results the first step of the non - perturbative diagonalization of the model corresponds to a mere unitary rotation in hilbert space which maps the electrons onto rotated electrons . for rotated electrons double occupation",

    "interestingly , such a rotation corresponds to a unitary transformation previously introduced by harris and lange @xcite .",

    "the @xmath15 @xmath5 pseudoparticles ( and @xmath15 spinons ) describe the charge part ( and spin part ) of the @xmath15 rotated electrons which singly occupy lattice sites .",
    "thus the charge and spin degrees of freedom of such a @xmath15-rotated - electron fluid separate . for each @xmath5 pseudoparticle",
    "there is a chargeon @xcite and a rotated - electronic hole .",
    "such a chargeon corresponds to the charge part of a rotated electron which singly occupies a site .",
    "we note that the numbers @xmath15 , @xmath20/2 $ ] , and @xmath21/2 $ ] equal the number of rotated - electron singly occupied sites , doubly occupied sites , and empty sites respectively .",
    "the non - perturbative organization of the electronic degrees of freedom also includes a @xmath20$]-rotated - electron fluid associated with the rotated - electron pairs occupying @xmath20/2 $ ] sites .",
    "each such a doubly occupied site corresponds to a spin singlet rotated electron pair which is nothing but a @xmath22 holon .",
    "such a two - fluid picture shows some formal analogies to those which characterize a superconductor or a superfluid .",
    "finally , the rotated - electron @xmath21/2 $ ] empty sites are nothing but the @xmath23 holons .",
    "the main goal of this paper is the study of the @xmath5 pseudoparticle , @xmath24 pseudoparticle , @xmath22 yang holon , and @xmath22 hl spinon double - occupation spectra .",
    "these functions are evaluated by use of the hellmann - feynman theorem @xcite . in the case of the pseudoparticles we find band - momentum dependent double - occupation spectra .",
    "analysis of these spectra provides important information about the localization / deslocalization degree of the real - space lattice electronic occupancy configurations which describe the pseudoparticles .",
    "we find that for some of the pseudoparticle branches such a degree of localization / delocalization is strongly dependent on the value of the pseudoparticle band momentum .",
    "our analysis leads to a double - occupation functional whose coefficients are the double - occupation spectra .",
    "this study confirms that the complex electron site distribution configurations of the real - space lattice which describe the energy eigenstates are dependent on the value of @xmath25 .",
    "we also consider @xmath26 electron double - occupation selection rules .",
    "these rules are used in ref .",
    "@xcite in finding exact rotated - electron selection rules which provide for all values of the on - site electronic repulsion the number of holons and spinons of the final states which contribute most significantly to few - electron correlation functions .",
    "these selection rules imply that a large number of matrix elements between energy eigenstates are vanishing .",
    "this simplifies the derivation of general expressions for correlation functions at finite excitation energy .",
    "this problem is studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition , we study the band - momentum , on - site electronic repulsion @xmath27 , and electronic density @xmath28 dependence of the pseudoparticle energy bands .",
    "such pseudoparticle energy bands are the coefficients of the first - order term of the finite - energy landau - liquid functional .",

    "@xcite by expanding the @xmath5 pseudoparticle , @xmath9 pseudoparticle , and @xmath10 pseudoparticle band - momentum distribution functions around their ground - state values .",
    "this is similar to the case of the quasi - particle energy functional of fermi liquid theory @xcite .",

    "the evaluation of the spectral functions of the model reveals that the one - electron and two - electron spectral weight of physical operators contains peaks and/or edges which are located on well - defined lines in the momentum @xmath29 and energy / frequency @xmath30 plane .",
    "importantly , the shape of these peak and edge lines is fully defined by the band - momentum dependence of the pseudoparticle energy bands studied in this paper .",
    "moreover , the expressions of the finite - energy correlation functions involve these pseudoparticle bands @xcite . therefore , our investigation is important for the study of the one - electron and two - electron spectral - weight distribution of physical operators .",
    "the study of the localization - delocalization degree of the real - space lattice electronic occupancy configurations which describe the pseudoparticles also contributes to important information about the physics behind these elementary quantum objects .",

    "we found that for some of the pseudoparticle branches such a degree of localization / delocalization is strongly dependent on the value of the band momentum .",
