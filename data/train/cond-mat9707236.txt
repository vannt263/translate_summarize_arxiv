    "<S> when a single atom is sandwiched in between two electrodes , an _ atomic _ tunneling device may be realized depending on the distance between the atom and the electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed first - principles pesudopotential calculation in conjunction with a three - dimensional evaluation of the quantum scattering matrix for such a device . </S>",
    "<S> we predict the quantum conductance and resonance transmission properties of the si and al atomic tunneling devices .    exploiting the band gap differences of various compound semiconductors such as gaas and algaas , resonance tunneling devices have been fabricated and extensively investigated since the original work of esaki@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a tunneling device may give rise to negative differential resistance due to a quantum resonance , leading to useful electronic applications . </S>",
    "<S> in this work , we propose and theoretically analyze a different kind tunneling device , namely _ atomic _ scale tunneling systems . rather than resonant transmitting through the quasi - bound states inside a double barrier tunneling structure , in the atomic system </S>",
    "<S> a resonance is through atomic orbitals . since atomic orbitals have energy spacings in the range of ev </S>",
    "<S> , the quantum resonance will not be smeared out by a room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> hence in principle room temperature quantum resonance tunneling devices can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> our work is encouraged by the measurements using scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) on quantum conduction through atomic scale tip - substrate systems@xcite , where quantized conductance is indeed observed at room temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose an atomic tunneling structure as shown schematically in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the essential part of the structure consists of two metallic electrodes sandwiching a single atom in between . </S>",
    "<S> the whole system could in principle be fabricated on top of an insulating substrate by micro - fabricating two electrodes and placing an atom in between using the atomic manipulation ability of stm . </S>",
    "<S> fixing the distance between the atom and the electrode , @xmath0 , vacuum barriers can be established on the two sides of the atom , thus a double - barrier atomic tunneling ( dbat ) device is established@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of using vacuum barriers to establish a tunnel junction is widely used in stm@xcite , but an dbat structure as an atomic quantum functional device is very interesting indeed . </S>",
    "<S> the main task of our work , to be presented below , is to predict quantum conductance of the dbat device for various values of @xmath0 , to investigate the formation of a atomic quantum point contact as @xmath0 is reduced thus diminishing the vacuum barriers , and to examine issues which arise when transport is mediated by atomic levels . although we have concentrated on dbat devices operated on a single atom , the idea can be extended to clusters , molecules , or other groups of atoms .    to capture the atomic degrees of freedom , </S>",
    "<S> we have combined the _ ab initio _ pseudopotential total energy method with a three - dimensional ( 3d ) quantum scattering evaluation of the transmission probabilities@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , we solve the _ ground state _ properties of the atom _ and _ the two leads by minimizing the kohn - sham total energy functional using a plane - wave basis set@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium analysis produces the self - consistent effective potential @xmath1 which is seen by all the electrons . here </S>",
    "<S> $ ] is the total self - consistent potential energy while @xmath3 the electron density . </S>",
    "<S> second , we evaluate the scattering matrix of an electron traversing the system defined by @xmath4 , by solving a 3d scattering problem using a transfer matrix technique@xcite . from the scattering matrix </S>",
    "<S> we obtain conductance from the landauer formula@xcite .    we have focused on dbat devices made of si and al atoms and used pseudopotentials of refs . for the core , and the parameterization of ref . for the exchange - correlation term . </S>",
    "<S> the leads are modeled by the jellium model . for si </S>",
    "<S> , a jellium lead has a cross section area of @xmath5 , length @xmath6a.u . , and its charge is specified@xcite by @xmath7a.u . , mimicking metallic leads . </S>",
    "<S> the supercell volume used in our plane - wave based _ ab initio _ calculations is @xmath8 ( a.u.)@xmath9 . for the al dbat device , the lead has a cross section area of @xmath10 , length @xmath11 , charge density specified by @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the supercell size for the al dbat device is @xmath13 ( a.u.)@xmath9 . the dbat setup with square shaped leads has a symmetry of space group d4h . </S>",
    "<S> we have used an upper energy cutoff of @xmath14 rydbergs@xcite .    for a single adatom on top of a high density jellium substrate , previous calculations showed@xcite that the equilibrium jellium - atom bond length is @xmath15a.u . </S>",
    "<S> for si , and @xmath16a.u . for al@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence for values of @xmath0 greater than these values , a vacuum barrier may be established . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) shows the @xmath4 for a si dbat device with @xmath17 a.u .. @xmath4 in the 3d leads is essentially a potential well with a depth @xmath18a.u . below the fermi level of the system . from @xmath4 it </S>",
    "<S> is clear that the atom is quite isolated from the leads by the vacuum barriers . </S>",
    "<S> reducing @xmath0 to @xmath19 and @xmath20a.u . </S>",
    "<S> , a lower vacuum barrier is obtained as expected . </S>",
    "<S> similar behavior is found for al dbat devices . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) , the sharp peak at the atomic position reflects the repulsive atomic core , and surrounding the core there is the usual attractive part of the atomic potential .    figs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2,3 ) show the conductance @xmath21 for a number of si and al dbat devices which differ by the jellium - atom junction distance @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath0 takes the value of equilibrium jellium - atom bond length , @xmath22 shows the expected `` quantized '' conductance@xcite for quasi-1d quantum wires . </S>",
    "<S> however a striking result is the apparent resonance transmission when the atom is isolated inside the dbat device by the barriers . for both si and al systems , the larger the @xmath0 , the sharper the resonances . </S>",
    "<S> this is because a larger @xmath0 corresponds to a more isolated atom . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance peaks must come from the atomic orbitals since the dbat device is operating on the electronic structure of the single atom . for a si atom , </S>",
    "<S> the valence configuration is @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the equilibrium `` fermi '' energy for an isolated atom should be located at the @xmath24 atomic level . </S>",
    "<S> for all the si dbat devices , our calculated @xmath25a.u . , which is very close to the higher energy peak position of fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to identify the resonance peak near @xmath26a.u . as due to the @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> atomic orbital . </S>",
    "<S> for the largest @xmath0 we studied , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ @xmath17a.u . </S>",
    "<S> , the sharp @xmath24 resonance is split into two nearby peaks as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is not difficult to understand this splitting when we realize that the @xmath24 state is triplely degenerate , and its rotational symmetry is broken by the presence of the squared shaped leads which is along the @xmath27-direction . </S>",
    "<S> hence for the single @xmath28 state , the resonance is marked by @xmath29 in units of @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the d4h space group respects the rotational symmetry in the @xmath31 direction , thus the degenerate @xmath32 states give @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason that these peaks are slightly higher than @xmath34 and @xmath35 is due to the partial overlap of the states , as is clearly seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) . when the lead - atom distance @xmath0 is smaller , such as @xmath36a.u . and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20a.u . , the atom is not as isolated . for these cases , </S>",
    "<S> the resonance width is larger which smears out the @xmath24 splits . as a result , the three states of @xmath24 atomic orbital gives a @xmath37 resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> after understanding the @xmath24 resonance peak , it is clear that the lower energy peak of fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) must result from the @xmath38 atomic state . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , since @xmath38 is a singlet , we have @xmath39 . for @xmath17a.u . </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath38 peak is extremely sharp , we reproduce it in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a crucial numerical test of these results is the distance between the peak positions . for a single si atom , </S>",
    "<S> lda calculation@xcite gives energy level spacing between the @xmath38 and @xmath24 states to be @xmath40a.u .. our conductance calculation , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) , gives the @xmath41 resonance distance in almost perfect agreement with the lda spectra , with only small differences due to the level splitting and the presence of the leads . </S>",
    "<S> hence it is unambiguous that the transport in a single atom dbat device is mediated by the atomic levels . for al dbat devices , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) , all the results give a physical picture which is consistent with that of the si system , including the quantitative value of the 3s-3p resonance peak distance . for different values of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , there is a small but noticeable shift of the relative peak positions ( see figs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2,3 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the coupling of the atom to the leads , and can be understood from previous model calculations@xcite . finally , figs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2,3 ) shows the formation of a transmissive quantum point contact : by reducing @xmath0 to the equilibrium bond length between the atom and the leads , the resonance transmission crosses over to the usual quantized conductance with a quasi-1d nature .    </S>",
    "<S> certain features of the _ ab initio _ results can be understood analytically . </S>",
    "<S> first , it can be generally shown@xcite that for 3d resonance tunneling through a symmetric double barrier potential , the peak value of the conductance @xmath22 for an isolated singlet state is universally @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the 3s peak shows this result . </S>",
    "<S> second , using the discussion of ref . and fermi s golden rule , it s not difficult to obtain the resonance width as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the tunneling rate from the atomic resonance level @xmath44 to the lead level @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the corresponding tunneling matrix element from @xmath44 to @xmath45 . since the tunneling rate decreases exponentially with the barrier size , we expect the resonance widths to do the same , which is clearly seen in our numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> third , we can understand why the @xmath28 resonance peak width is wider than that of the @xmath47 peak . using a first - order approximation for the tunneling matrix@xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the lead state </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath50 is the atomic state , and @xmath51 is the potential due to the lead . by approximating the lead wavefunctions with finite square well wavefunctions , and @xmath51 as a potential well , we find @xmath52 for @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees well with the value of @xmath54 from our _ ab initio _ calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude , that the @xmath28 resonance peak width is wider than that of the @xmath32 peak , because the overlap of the @xmath28 state with the lead wavefunctions is much larger than the corresponding overlap for the @xmath47 states .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have proposed and theoretically investigated atomic scale double barrier tunneling devices . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum resonance transmission in this system is through atomic orbitals , thus conductances obtained characterizes the conduction through a single atom and reveals the valence atomic spectra . </S>",
    "<S> finally we comment that the curves of @xmath55 are useful for giving a first estimate of the electrical current as a function of a voltage across the dbat device : one obtains the current in the usual fashion by integrating @xmath22 over energy convoluted with a fermi function . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the atomic dbat device lies in the fact that the quantum resonances are observable at room temperature due to the large energy scales ( ev ) associated with the atomic system . indeed , with the nonlinear conductance behavior of the dbat device , many applications can be envisioned . </S>"
