    "[ intro ]    invented by the sumerians in ancient mesopotamia around 3000 bc , @xcite , writing may be considered one of the greatest human inventions of all - times . since then , it has been used to store , transmit and manipulate information .",
    "concurrently , the technology employed in writing has changed over the years .",
    "the development of computers , perhaps one of mankind s most significant technological revolutions in the last century , was intrinsically linked to writing . despite the principles of modern computers having been described by alan turing in 1936 @xcite , the first programmable * electronic * computer was not built until 1946 , at pennsylvania university @xcite . in the following 6 years , john von neumann and co - workers laid the ground work upon which modern computers rest to this day @xcite .",
    "the first generation of commercial electronic computers was made available in the us in 1951 , but the giant leap towards our current technologies occurred in 1955 , when the so - called ` second generation computers ' reached the market @xcite .",
    "since that time , the evolution of computers has been linked to the advent of semiconductor electronics .",
    "simply put , this is the technology associated with the control of how the electrons move in semiconductor materials",
    ". the majority of our current information devices function because of our ability to control electron currents from one spot to another one , and re - interpret this current as chains of 0 s and 1 s , which are used to encode information . since the 1970 s , our means of re - interpreting electron currents as chains of 0 s and 1 s have remained fundamentally unchanged .",
    "however , the techniques and devices to move electrons around in a controlled manner have changed drastically .",
    "of particular note , the size of the electronic devices has decreased by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this can be observed in figure [ fig11 ] .    ]    ` the past ' includes the electronic circuits ( using semiconductor electronics , or vacuum tubes ) used up until the 1980 s . from then onwards ,",
    "the semiconductor manufacturing processes achieved sizes below 1@xmath1 m  currently known as nano - electronics .",
    "in fact , nano - electronics has advanced at a very fast pace , consistently following moore s law @xcite . at present , is fabricating transistors at 22 nm , and current projections are that the 11 nm technology will be obtained by 2015 .",
    "+   + the fact that electronics has been so successful over the past 60 years does not imply that it is the ultimate technology to carry out digital writing or information processing .",
    "* photonics * has been following a delayed but similar development .",
    "the term photonics began to be used in the late 1960 s , once it became evident that photons could be used as bits of information in the same way as electrons were being used .",
    "however , it did not reach the common use until the 1980 s , when the ieee lasers and electro - optics society established an archival journal named photonics technology letters .",
    "some of the early crucial developments in the field were the invention of the laser in 1958 @xcite ; the diode laser in the 1962 @xcite ; the first demonstration of optical communication using optical fibres in 1966 , done at the university of ulm , germany @xcite ; and the invention of the optical fibre amplifier in the early 1980 s @xcite .",
    "photonics presents some significant advantages over electronics .",
    "the most important one is speed . due to its much larger carrier frequencies , photonics has a much larger bandwidth ( or data transmission rate ) than electronics .",
    "this is depicted in figure [ fig12 ] , which shows that the operating speed of photonic devices can be up to five orders of magnitude higher than electronics .    ]",
    "another important feature of photons is their weak interaction with the environment .",
    "photons can travel long distances almost without changing their state .",
    "this implies much lower losses in transmission .",
    "actually , this feature is also exploited in quantum information , in particular in the field of quantum cryptography @xcite to create secure protocols to data exchange . as a consequence ,",
    "photonic integrated circuits have been gaining a lot of attention in recent times @xcite .",
    "the most ambitious goal is to eventually usurp the predominant role of electronic integrated circuits in information devices .",
    "however , the goal seems to be unrealistic at the moment .",
    "photonic circuits suffer from a lack of storage capacity , _",
    "i.e. _ it is difficult to stop and store light .",
    "hence , the storage needs to be done in an electronic medium . moreover , integrated electronics is non - linear , whereas non - linear integrated photonics still needs to evolve to be competitive in the market .",
    "last but not least , the typical size of photonic components is limited by the wavelength of light . due to the diffraction limit of light , dielectric photonic circuit can not resolve or retrieve information smaller than a fraction of the wavelength ( 200 nm approximately ) @xcite , as opposed to nano - electronics where 22 nm transistors are already a reality .",
    "+   + most of the efforts to overcome the diffraction limitations in photonics have been happening in the field of plasmonics .",
    "in fact , lots of authors consider that nanophotonics should be based on metallic nano - plasmonics ( see figure [ fig13 ] ) @xcite .    ]",
    "plasmonics is the science that studies the interaction between light and free electrons on a metal .",
    "the first theoretical studies in plasmonics were done in the 1950 s @xcite , and the first experiments with metallic surfaces in the 1970 s @xcite . in general , the strategy followed in plasmonics to bring photonics down to the nano - scale has a sample - based perspective .",
    "that is , given a fixed external excitation beam ( see inset in figure [ fig14](a ) for a typical example ) , samples are engineered ( shape and materials ) so that they produce certain effects .",
    ", width=548 ]    for example , in figure [ fig14](a ) , an array of metallic nano - rods is fabricated to guide light from one location to another .",
    "similarly , in figure [ fig14](b ) a circular nano - hole drilled in a gold film deposited on top of a glass layer is inserted into a liquid chamber .",
    "the excitation of the structure enabled the authors of @xcite to trap 50 nm particles that had been dissolved in the water solution .",
    "there is no doubt that fabrication and characterization of samples play a huge role in the current plasmonic technologies .",
    "interestingly , the spatial profile of the incident beam also plays a very important role .",
    "however , most of the work in the field is done with gaussian beams ( the beam on the inset of figure [ fig14 ] ) . in this thesis",
    ", it will be shown that more elaborate beams of light can be used to retrieve plenty of additional information from nano - structures .",
    "an illustrative example is the stimulated emission depletion ( sted ) microscopy .",
    "sted microscopy was invented by stefan hell and co - workers in 1994 @xcite .",
    "it is one of the so - called super - resolution microscopy methods , as it can resolve defects as tiny as 30 nm .",
    "a very complete schematic of its working principle is shown in figure [ fig15 ] , and its working principle can be found in @xcite .    ]    even though figure [ fig15 ] is complicated , the message should be clear . probing a sub - wavelength specimen with a gaussian beam ( green beam in figure [ fig15 ] ) results in a blurry image ( figure [ fig15](c ) ) . nevertheless , the combined use of a gaussian and a doughnut - shaped beam ( red ) results in a much neater image ( see figure [ fig15](d ) ) .",
    "there are different kinds of doughnut - shaped beams , but the ones used in sted are called vortex beams @xcite .",
    "+   + vortex beams are defined by their topological charge @xmath2 , which is an integer number .",
    "the topological charge @xmath2 accounts for the number of times that the phase of the beam wraps around its centre in a @xmath3 circle .",
    "examples of four different vortex beams are shown in figure [ fig16 ] .    .",
    "for the intensity plots , red indicates maximum and dark blue minimum . for the phase ,",
    "white means @xmath4 phase , and black means @xmath3 .",
    "[ fig16 ] ]    it can be seen that when @xmath5 , the phase goes from @xmath4 to @xmath3 one time in counter - clockwise direction .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath6 , the phase goes three times from @xmath4 to @xmath3 in a clockwise direction . in chapter [ ch5 ] , sections [ ch5_cgh ] and [ ch5_slm ]",
    "have been dedicated to explain how to characterize and generate vortex beams in the laboratory .",
    "note that the definition of vortex beam and topological charge is independent of the polarisation .",
    "however , for many applications in nano - photonics ( sted microscopy is one of them ) , vortex beams need to be tightly focused .",
    "when that is the case , vortex beams become much more complex .",
    "in fact , in that regime , the definition of the phase singularity is polarisation - dependent .",
    "this is what many authors have described as one of the manifestations of the spin - to - orbit conversion @xcite .",
    "then , characterising vortex beams in terms of their symmetries becomes enormously useful .",
    "it allows for a systematic study of the beam without the need of considering different focusing regimes .",
    "+   + sections [ ch1_basis ] and [ ch1_multipoles ] are dedicated to a systematic characterisation of beams in terms of their symmetries .",
    "thanks to the understanding and analysis of the different transformations under which light beams are symmetric , different results have been obtained , both theoretically and experimentally . in the succeeding chapters , three symmetries",
    "have been specially studied : mirror symmetry , rotational symmetry , and duality @xcite . both samples and beams of light which are ( or are not )",
    "symmetric under these transformations have been used and as a consequence new fundamental phenomena have been found . in chapter",
    "[ ch3 ] , the interaction between single spheres and cylindrically symmetric beams has been theoretically studied . among others ,",
    "a technique to excite whispering gallery modes ( wgms ) has been developed . in chapter",
    "[ ch4 ] , the cylindrical symmetry of a single sphere and the duality symmetry of a light beam have been used to cancel the forward scattering of a sample .",
    "furthermore , it has been proven that a sample can effectively be dual in a controlled manner if its dimensions are changed in a certain way with respect to an incident cylindrically symmetric beam . in chapter",
    "[ ch6 ] , a mirror and cylindrically symmetric sample has been used to induce a giant circular dichroism ( cd ) . again , the use of dual , cylindrically and mirror symmetric modes has been a key point to be able to achieve it . finally , chapter [ ch7 ]",
    "merges all the knowledge accumulated in the previous chapters , both theoretical and experimental . using various dual cylindrically symmetric beams , the resonant scattering behaviour of a dielectric sphere is unveiled .",
    "this resonant behaviour is hidden under the gaussian beam ( or plane wave ) excitation , and the use of vortex beams is crucial to find it .",
    "due to time constraints , this last study is not as thorough as the others presented in the previous chapters . nevertheless , it allowed for an experimental observation of some of the theoretical predictions of the thesis .",
    "+   + now , even though the details of what has been done in each chapter may be too technical for a non - specialised reader , these should only be considered to emphasise the point made before : nanophotonics can also be done from another perspective different from the prevailing sample - based view . in particular , the consideration of the sample and the exciting light as a whole system , along with symmetry considerations , allows for the discovery of new phenomena at the nano - scale .",
    "the future in this unexplored direction looks as exciting as promising . in the next chapters ,",
    "the reader will find a taste of it .",
    "`` if i could explain it to the average person , i would nt have been worth the nobel prize . ''",
    "[ ch1 ]      the material presented in this thesis can be described using the tools of em field theory @xcite . in particular , the subdivisions of em field theory that this thesis especially deals with are electromagnetic optics and vectorial scattering theory @xcite . in this chapter , i will introduce all the necessary concepts and tools to understand the theoretical developments scattered across the next chapters . for completeness",
    ", the starting point will be the macroscopic maxwell equations for a source - free medium @xcite :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath10 is the electric displacement , and @xmath11 is the magnetic induction .",
    "the relations between @xmath10 and @xmath8 , as well as between @xmath11 and @xmath9 are given by the properties of the medium :    @xmath12    with @xmath13 being the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of vacuum .",
    "@xmath14 is defined as the polarization density , which is the density of molecular dipole moments induced by the electric field @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xmath15 , defined as the magnetization density , is the density of molecular magnetic dipole moments induced by the magnetic field .",
    "i will be particularly interested in linear , non - dispersive , homogeneous and isotropic media . in these cases",
    ", a linear relation can be established between @xmath14 and @xmath8 , and therefore the following relation holds @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a scalar quantity defining the electrical properties of the medium called electric permittivity . in the same way , a linear relation can be cast between @xmath15 and @xmath9 , yielding the following linear relation between @xmath11 and @xmath9 @xmath18 with @xmath1 being the so - called magnetic permeability constant of the medium",
    "hence , the macroscopic maxwell equations for a linear , non - dispersive , homogeneous , isotropic and source - free medium can be written only as functions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite :    @xmath19    here , i will be especially interested in the monochromatic solutions of these equations .",
    "that is , i will suppose that all the fields have a @xmath20 time dependence , with @xmath21 being the frequency of light .",
    "then , any field can be expressed as the real part of a product of a purely temporal part and a purely spatial part : @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 represents a complex - amplitude vector .",
    "then , equations ( [ e_max_eh ] ) can be re - written just in terms of their spatially dependent parts :    @xmath24    now , applying the curl operation to equations ( [ e_max_eh_mono ] ) and making use of the vector identity @xmath25 , one obtains that both @xmath26 and @xmath27 fulfil the vectorial helmholtz equation @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is known as the wave - number .",
    "nonetheless , equations ( [ e_max_eh_mono ] , [ e_max_helm ] ) can not be uniquely solved unless some boundary conditions ( bc ) are applied .",
    "firstly , the em fields must have a proper decay at infinity and be finite everywhere else .",
    "secondly , when equations ( [ e_max_eh_mono ] ) are applied between two different media , the following bc need to hold : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the surface charge density at the surface ; @xmath32 is the surface current density ; @xmath33 is the unitary normal vector to the interface between 1 and 2 ; and @xmath34 and @xmath35 account for the electric and magnetic fields at two different media .",
    "it is observed that the tangential components of @xmath26 and @xmath27 must be continuous , while the normal components of @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be discontinuous depending on the properties of the surface .",
    "equations ( [ e_max_eh_mono ] ) plus the bc listed above will be the framework in which this thesis will be grounded on .",
    "in the previous section , i have introduced the monochromatic maxwell equations for linear , non - dispersive , homogeneous , isotropic and source - free media ( see equation ( [ e_max_eh_mono ] ) ) .",
    "i will impose that all the theoretical developments done in this thesis fulfil equations ( [ e_max_eh_mono ] ) .",
    "that is , i will require that any meaningful * em field * fulfils equations ( [ e_max_eh_mono ] ) , bcs ( [ e_bc ] ) , it decays properly at infinity and it is finite everywhere else .",
    "+   + another framework to do optical physics is the paraxial equation @xcite , which is an approximation of equations ( [ e_max_eh_mono ] ) but it is much simpler to use . in paraxial optics , a complex - amplitude electric field @xmath38 can be expressed as @xmath39 , with @xmath40 being a complex - wave amplitude scalar function that must fulfil the paraxial equation @xmath41 and @xmath42 being an arbitrary polarization vector .",
    "then , it is clear that in paraxial optics the vectorial character of the field ( given by @xmath42 ) is decoupled from its spatial properties ( given by @xmath40 ) .",
    "the importance of the paraxial equation is that collimated beams , which are very frequently used in the laboratory , can be accurately described within this framework . in those beams , if the propagation direction of the beam is the @xmath43 axis , a plane wave decomposition of the wave yields partial waves whose @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ( see [ ch1_planewaves ] to check the definitions of @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "this implies that the complex amplitude function @xmath40 can be expressed as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a magnitude called the envelope of the wave which varies slowly with @xmath43 : @xmath50 however , the paraxial approximation does not properly work in nano - optics . in nano - optics ,",
    "light beams are either tightly focused or interact with sub - wavelength objects . in those cases ,",
    "the polarization degrees of freedom of the beams can not be decoupled from their spatial properties @xcite .",
    "then , imposing that all em fields must be solutions of the full maxwell equations rules out all those beams that fulfil the paraxial equation , but are not solutions of the full maxwell equations given by equation ( [ e_max_eh_mono ] ) @xcite . +   +",
    "now , i will define an * operator * as an entity that picks up any em field fulfilling equations [ e_max_eh_mono ] and transforms it into a different one that still fulfils equations [ e_max_eh_mono ] .",
    "finally , i will define a * symmetry group * as a set of operators with group structure .",
    "a group @xmath51 is defined as a set of elements @xmath52 along with an inner product .",
    "the inner product ( @xmath53 ) is such that the product of two arbitrary elements of the group yields an element of the group @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the product must satisfy the following conditions @xcite :    * it must be associative , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "* there must be an element @xmath56 , called the identity , which is such that @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "* for each @xmath59 , there must exist an element @xmath60 , called the inverse of @xmath61 , such that @xmath62 .",
    "groups can be subdivided into two categories - discrete , and continuous . in physics ,",
    "most of continuous groups of interest are part of a subdivision called ` linear lie groups ' @xcite . linear lie groups can be labelled by one or more continuous variables .",
    "in fact , each label is related to a generator .",
    "the generators of the group define the local behaviour of the group near the identity , and any element of the group can be obtained as a smooth function of the generator . for example , for the @xmath63 group of 2-dimensional rotations , any rotation @xmath64 can be obtained as @xmath65 , with @xmath66 the generator of the group .",
    "note that this implies that if the element of the group is an operator , so must be the generator .",
    "in fact , group generators are very good candidates to compose a complete set of commuting operators .",
    "a complete set of commuting operators of a vector space is a set of operators that commute with each other and whose eigenvalues completely specify the state of a system @xcite .",
    "the idea is that if an em field is an eigenvector of a generator of a symmetry , then it is also invariant under the symmetry transformation generated by that generator , and vice versa @xcite . then , using generators to make a set of commuting operators will be useful as the fields will be characterized in terms of their symmetries .",
    "now , i will differentiate between em fields and * em modes*. em fields are solutions of maxwell equations ( [ e_max_eh_mono ] ) , whereas em modes are elements of a basis of solutions of maxwell equations ( [ e_max_eh_mono ] ) .",
    "thus , in general , any em field can be decomposed into em modes .",
    "in addition , em modes will be chosen so that they are eigenstates of some generators , _",
    "i.e. _ they will be invariant under certain symmetries .",
    "next , i will list the most common operators that i will use to describe em modes and their differential representation will be given .",
    "some of them are generators of symmetries , so in those cases i will also comment on the symmetries that they give rise to .    * , @xmath67 .",
    "the hamiltonian is the generator of temporal translations ( or time evolution ) @xcite .",
    "that is , the transformation @xmath68 applied to an em field @xmath69 the state evolve from @xmath70 to @xmath71 : @xmath72 = \\psi(\\mathbf{r},t+\\delta t)\\ ] ] * @xmath73 .",
    "this is a vectorial operator , _",
    "i.e. _ it is composed of three operators in three different directions : @xmath74 .",
    "its three components commute with each other @xmath75 = 0 $ ] .",
    "each of the components generates a translation in its corresponding axis .",
    "hence , the vectorial addition of all of them is the generator of linear translations in any direction of space : @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath77 =   \\psi(\\mathbf{r } + \\delta \\mathbf{r } , t)\\ ] ] * , @xmath78 , with @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively , where @xmath81 is the total anti - symmetric tensor and @xmath82 .",
    "it is also composed of three operators in three components , @xmath83 , but they do not commute with each other : @xmath84 = i \\epsilon_{ijk } j_k$ ] .",
    "the reason why the three components of the angular momentum ( am ) @xmath85 do not commute is that they are the generators of rotations on three different axis , and rotations do not commute ( whereas spatial translations do , see above ) @xcite .",
    "a general rotation of an angle @xmath86 along an axis on the direction @xmath33 is given by : @xmath87 .",
    "then , the application of a rotation onto a general em field yields : @xmath88 = \\mathbf{m}_{{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}(\\varphi )   \\cdot \\psi(\\mathbf{m}_{{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}^{-1}(\\varphi ) \\cdot \\mathbf{r},t )   \\label{e_rotpsi}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is a rotation matrix @xcite ( see appendix [ appendix ] ) . finally , note that even though the @xmath90 and @xmath91 operators used to define @xmath85 are usually called orbital and spin am respectively , they are not proper am momentum operator on their own @xcite .",
    "none of them generates proper rotations , only their addition does .",
    "furthermore , they are not proper operators , as their application to an em field fulfilling maxwell equations yields a field that does not fulfil maxwell equations @xcite . * , @xmath92 , where @xmath93 have been defined in iii ) .",
    "@xmath94 is called a casimir operator , and commutes with all the operators . even though it does not generate any meaningful transformation , it is very useful for problems with spherical symmetry . * , @xmath95 .",
    "the helicity operator is defined as the projection of the am onto the direction of the linear momentum .",
    "it was proven in @xcite that @xmath96 generates generalized duality transformations @xcite : @xmath97 .",
    "generalized duality transformations mix the electric and magnetic parts of an em field . that is , if we express @xmath98 as @xmath99 , then @xmath100 = d_{\\varphi } \\left [ \\left ( \\begin{array}{l } { \\mathbf{e}}(\\mathbf{r},t ) \\\\   { \\mathbf{h}}(\\mathbf{r},t )",

    "unlike all the rest of symmetries listed hereby , duality symmetry is a non - geometrical symmetry .",
    "it can be proven that its preservation only depends on the material properties of the medium in consideration @xcite",
    ". a very thorough study of duality symmetry and its generator ( helicity ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "* , @xmath102 .",
    "parity transformations @xmath103 are discrete , therefore they are not generated by any other operator .",

    "a mirror transformation of the kind @xmath105 indicates that the spatial coordinates are reflected off a plane given by its normal vector @xmath33 .",
    "the difference is that in @xmath105 the reflection is off a plane whose normal vector is @xmath33 , whereas @xmath106 indicates that the reflection is done upon a plane that contains the axis @xmath33 . ] .",

    "the aim of this chapter is to establish the basis on which the works presented on this thesis are grounded . in section [ ch1_hilmax",
    "] , i have introduced maxwell equations .",
    "then , in section [ ch1_symm ] , i have discussed that i will require all the em fields to fulfil maxwell equations in its form given by equations ( [ e_max_eh_mono ] ) . furthermore , some operators and generators have been introduced . in this section and the next one , six different sets of em modes that stem from six different sets of complete commuting operators will be described .",
    "each of these sets of em modes will be especially suited to describe some particular em interactions .",
    "in fact , since generators of symmetries will be used as the operators in a set , a set of modes will be chosen over another depending on the symmetries of the interaction .",
    "there are different ways of constructing these sets of em modes . from a symmetries point of view , probably the clearest technique is ` the induced representation method ' .",
    "wu - ki tung describes it in chapter 9 of his book @xcite . as in most of the cases ,",

    "in fact , this is what is seen in the expressions ( [ e_ajm_hank ] ) , where complex angles would be needed if the double integral @xmath228 was to be expressed in spherical coordinates .",
    "the work presented in this thesis belongs to the field of nano - optics .",
    "that is , most of the work deals with light - matter interactions where the light is at optical wavelengths ( @xmath229 $ ] nm @xcite ) and the matter is a nano - structure .",
    "i will be specially interested in single nano - structures , therefore it will be almost mandatory to tightly focus the beam onto the structure , so that the light - matter interaction is stronger .",
    "however , this is not the typical approach in nanophotonics or metamaterials , where structures are mostly designed to interact with paraxial gaussian beams or plane waves @xcite . in general",
    ", the approach followed in the design of nano - circuits or nano - materials is the following one .",
    "the nano - structure is characterized by its scattering matrix @xmath230 .",
    "this scattering matrix is a function of many geometrical and material properties of the system , @xmath231 , where @xmath232 and @xmath233 are general sets of variables describing the geometrical and material properties of the structure .",
    "however , the properties of the structure do not depend on the incident field .",
    "then , the response of the structure to an incoming field @xmath234 can be cast as a convolution of @xmath231 with @xmath234 : @xmath235 since the properties of the structure do not depend on @xmath234 and the incoming field is well - known ( a plane wave ) , the light - matter interaction is reduced to a complete characterization of the scattering matrix @xmath236 . then , adjusting the geometry or material of the structure , a controlled interaction can be carried out . in this thesis",
    ", i will look at these light - matter interactions from a different perspective @xcite .",
    "i will study single highly symmetric nano - structures whose scattering matrix are analytical or easy to compute .",
    "then , i will use different plane waves decompositions to control the scattering .",
    "that is , instead of controlling @xmath237 with the geometry and materials of the structure , the interaction will be controlled with the incoming field @xmath234 : @xmath238 where @xmath239 is each of the different plane waves that take part in the superposition , and @xmath240 is the fourier transform of the incident field , which modulates the plane wave decomposition .",
    "thus , it will be crucial to know the analytical expression and the symmetries of the incoming beam .",
    "in addition , as previously mentioned , due to the fact that single structures will be used , tightly focused light beams will be used to strengthen the light - matter interaction .",
    "tightly focused beams can be analytically described with the aplanatic model of a lens .",
    "this is explained in the following section .      in this section ,",
    "i study one of the most frequently used models to describe the focusing of light beams , _",
    "i.e. _ the aplanatic lens model @xcite . in particular",
    ", i will be especially interested in the symmetries of this model .",
    "i will show that the aplanatic lens model does not change the helicity nor the am content of the beam as long as some conditions are met .",
    "when those are met , the focusing of a bessel beam with a well - defined helicity such as @xmath178 can be easily modelled as @xmath241 .",
    "thus , @xmath242 will still be an eigenvector of @xmath96 and @xmath158 .",
    "but before getting there , the aplanatic model of a lens is explained .",
    "the variables playing a role in the model are the collimated incident beam @xmath234 , the focal distance of the lens @xmath243 , and the refractive indexes of the media on the two sides of the lens @xmath244 , @xmath245 .",
    "the geometrical representation of the aplanatic model is given by figure [ fig21 ] .",
    "is the incident collimated electric field ; @xmath246 is the focused field ; @xmath244 , @xmath245 are the refractive indexes of the media embedding the lens before and after the field is focused ; @xmath247 and @xmath248 are polarization vectors in cylindrical and spherical coordinates .",
    "[ fig21],width=491 ]    as it can be seen there , the collimated beam @xmath234 travels in a medium whose refractive index is @xmath244 and hits the back - aperture of a lens .",
    "the analytical description of the collimated beam at the a @xmath43 plane of the back - aperture of the lens is done in the paraxial approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath249 with @xmath42 being the polarisation vector . the incident beam gets refracted and its expression @xmath250 is obtained as : @xmath251 \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{n_1}}(\\cos { \\theta_k})^{1/2 }   \\label{e_einf}\\ ] ] where @xmath252 are the effective fresnel coefficients of the lens for @xmath128 and @xmath129 waves respectively @xcite ; @xmath253 and @xmath254 are the polarization vectors in cylindrical and spherical coordinates ( see figure [ fig21 ] ) .",
    "note that three assumptions have been made here .",
    "first , the sine condition of geometrical optics has been considered . the sine condition states that any ray emerging or converging to the focus of an aplanatic system meets its conjugate ray at the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath243 , at a distance of the optical axis @xmath255 , where @xmath256 is the divergence angle @xcite .",
    "second , the intensity law has also been assumed .",
    "the intensity law implies that the energy incident on the aplanatic lens equals the energy leaving it .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath257 @xcite .",
    "finally , it is imposed that the real space - expression of @xmath234 on that @xmath43 plane gives rise to the angular spectrum of the focused beam .",
    "that is , when introducing the expression of @xmath234 in equation ( [ e_einf ] ) , the following change of variables needs to be done : @xmath258 where no @xmath43 dependence is supposed as the expression is taken on a plane with a constant @xmath43 . with all this , the electric field at the focus of the lens is obtained as :    @xmath259    with @xmath243 being the focal distance of the lens , and @xmath260 with na the numerical aperture of the lens .      the fact that the aplanatic model preserves the helicity of light is not trivial nor a casualty .",
    "in fact , simple lenses made of glass do not preserve helicity .",
    "however , it is interesting for different applications that the polarisation of light is preserved under a microscope set - up . in order to achieve",
    "that ( which implies helicity preservation ) , microscope objective manufacturers need to apply a special coating to microscope objectives @xcite",
    ". this fact is translated into a condition relating the effective fresnel coefficients @xmath261 . in order to show this condition , a general plane wave with a well - defined helicity @xmath262",
    "will be focused down using the aplanatic lens model .",
    "it will be seen that the helicity of the beam is preserved provided a certain condition is met .",
    "consider a general incident paraxial beam with a well - defined helicity @xmath262 within the paraxial approximation and a @xmath263 dependence : @xmath264 where @xmath265 is the amplitude of the electric field on the plane of the back - aperture of the lens .",
    "then , the computation of @xmath250 yields : @xmath266   \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{n_1}}(\\cos { \\theta_k})^{1/2 } \\label{e_einf_hel}\\ ] ] where the following equalities have been used : @xmath267 equation ( [ e_einf_hel ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath128 and @xmath129 : @xmath268   \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{n_1}}(\\cos { \\theta_k})^{1/2 } \\label{e_einf_sp}\\ ] ] where the two following relations have been used : @xmath269 hence , examining equation ( [ e_einf_sp ] ) , it is straightforward to conclude that the aplanatic lens model preserves helicity if and only if @xmath270 i will consider that equation ( [ e_tstp ] ) is valid for the rest of my theoretical calculations .",
    "looking at figure [ fig21 ] , one notices that the geometrical representation of the aplanatic model is cylindrically symmetric around the @xmath43 axis .",
    "thanks to noether s theorem , in principle it follows that the model preserves @xmath158 . nevertheless , in the same way as it happened in the previous subsection , the fresnel coefficients play an important role .",
    "indeed , next it will be proven that either the fresnel coefficients fulfil a certain condition , or the model is not cylindrically symmetric and therefore does not preserves @xmath158 . using equation ( [ e_apl_model ] ) ,",
    "the expression for the electric field at the focus of the aplanatic lens when an incoming beam given by equation ( [ e_ein_ep ] ) can be computed : @xmath271 it is interesting to see that equation ( [ e_efoc_ep ] ) can be expressed as a superposition of rotated plane waves with a well - defined helicity .",
    "the way to construct such a superposition is intuitive and reflects very well the definition of the helicity of a beam .",
    "we take a circularly polarized plane wave propagating along the z axis with helicity @xmath262 .",
    "we rotate it in all directions and we sum all the different contributions with a certain weight @xmath272 .",

    "given by equation ( [ e_gthphi ] ) , the field at the focus of a lens can be given by : @xmath279 now , i will show that @xmath246 has a well - defined @xmath158 if the incoming field does , too .",
    "that is , i will show that the aplanatic model of a lens preserves @xmath158 by verifying the following condition : @xmath280 = m { \\mathbf{e}^\\mathrm{in } } & \\longrightarrow &   j_z [ \\mathbf{e}^{\\mathrm{foc } } ] = m \\mathbf{e}^{\\mathrm{foc } } \\end{array}\\ ] ] a paraxial beam with a well - defined helicity @xmath262 and an value of @xmath281 with eigenvalue @xmath282 . ] is given by any expression of the kind : @xmath283 if this expression is substituted in equation ( [ e_gthphi ] ) , the following expression for @xmath276 follows : @xmath284 now , in order to prove that the aplanatic lens model does not change the @xmath158 content of @xmath285 , i apply @xmath158 to @xmath246 when @xmath276 is given by equation ( [ e_g_par ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath246 can be expressed as a rotation helps to compute the result . as seen by equation ( [ e_jzb ] ) , @xmath158 can be applied as a partial derivative with respect to @xmath218 under the integral operation .",

    "unfortunately for lorenz , mie s name has stuck in the literature and nowadays the problem is mostly known as the mie scattering problem @xcite .",

    "although in many cases the light beam produced by a laser could be modelled as a plane wave with a good approximation , a more general theory that took into account the spatial non - uniformity of light beams was needed . in this context , the generalized lorenz - mie theory ( glmt ) was created in the 1980 s @xcite .",
    "the glmt development was especially led by grard gouesbet and grard grhan , both professors at the university of rouen , france . in its first ten years",
    ", the progress of glmt was mainly focused on the theoretical part . in 1985 ,",
    "gouesbet _ et al . _ managed to solve the scattering problem of a free propagating gaussian beam interacting with an on - axis arbitrary sphere using bromwich potentials @xcite .",
    "and then , in 1988 , a seminal paper was also published by gouesbet and co - workers where the scattering of a sphere located in an arbitrary position with respect to the axis of propagation of a gaussian beam was solved @xcite .",
    "this paper laid the foundations of the glmt , as it solved the scattering problem of a single sphere excited with an arbitrary beam of light @xcite . since then , as the theoretical framework had already been laid , the development of the theory happened in the applications and computation side .",

    ", i will summarize the main theoretical results of glmt and interpret them from a symmetry - based point of view .",
    "the wide variety of applications of glmt is a proof of the success of the theory .",

    "now , due to the fact that continuous symmetries can be expressed as a function of their generators , i will use the generators of the three first symmetries to classify the natural modes of the system ( see section [ ch1_symm ] ) :    * hamiltonian , @xmath131 .",

    "it can be observed from equations ( [ general ] ) that once the coefficients @xmath324 have been found for the incident field , the solution of the scattering problem is straightforward : the expression for the scattered and interior fields are a mere formal copy of the incident field , where each multipole is modulated by a mie coefficient .",
    "hence , the key point to solve the generalized lorenz - mie problem is finding the coefficients @xmath324 . both @xmath309 and @xmath310",
    "are usually known as beam shape coefficients , except for a subtlety . in glmt ,",

    "thus , from equation ( [ ei ] ) , we obtain : @xmath332 equations ( [ int_gjm ] , [ int_gje ] ) give us the formal solution of the problem .",
    "hence , solving the glmt problem basically consists in computing two sets of two - dimensional angular integrals .",
    "with our current computational power , @xmath309 and @xmath310 can be computed using standard numerical integration techniques , without too much of a struggle .",
    "nevertheless , as mentioned in [ ch2_intro ] , that was not the case when glmt was firstly formulated , and so a lot of effort was put into computing the beam shape coefficients .",
    "a very complete review of all the different available techniques to compute the beam shape coefficients can be found in @xcite .",
    "i will not explicitly comment further on those techniques , as in the proceeding sections i will simplify ( [ int_gjm ] , [ int_gje ] ) thanks to some symmetry considerations .      in the previous section",
    "i have given the expressions of the em field in all points of space . nonetheless , it is difficult to measure the em field in experiments at optical frequencies . therefore , we need to derive some quantities that we can experimentally determine , even though they might provide a less complete description of the scattering process .",
    "one of these quantities is the em power carried by the radiation , since many light detectors are sensitive to it .",
    "thus , we need to mathematically characterize how much power is carried by the three fields in the problem . in order to do that , we first define the time - averaged poynting vector dependence is supposed ] @xcite : @xmath333 \\label{poyting}\\ ] ] now , the total fields are obtained adding the scattered and incident fields , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath307 .",
    "hence , we can split the time - averaged poynting vector in three parts : @xmath334 \\\\ \\langle { \\mathbf{s}^\\mathrm{s}}\\rangle & = & \\dfrac{1}{2 } \\text{re } \\left [ { \\mathbf{e}^\\mathrm{s}}\\times ( { \\mathbf{h}^\\mathrm{s}})^ *   \\right ] \\\\",

    "we will denote this flux as minus the absorption cross - section : @xmath335 where @xmath336 is a differential surface element , with @xmath33 being the normal vector to this element at every point .",
    "due to the distributive property of integrals , this can be also split in three terms , to which we will refer as incident , scattering and extinction cross - sections : @xmath337 clearly , if we consider the flux of the poynting vector across a spherical surface , @xmath338 , as the surrounding medium is non - absorbing .",
    "the choice of a spherical surface simplifies the calculations without any loss of generality , therefore i will use it for the rest of the calculations .",
    "this will directly imply that the surface element @xmath339 , and the normal vector @xmath33 will point in the radial direction @xmath340 .",

    "then , it can be proven that @xmath346 where the two following relations have been used @xcite : @xmath347 note that equation ( [ e_cs ] ) differs from the expression given in @xcite in some factors due to the fact that the normalisation of the multipolar modes given by equation [ e_mul_norm ] is not considered in @xcite using the bromwich potentials . very similarly , the following expression can be obtained for @xmath348 @xcite : @xmath349 \\label{e_cext}\\ ] ] consequently , @xmath350 can be obtained subtracting expressions ( [ e_cext ] ) and ( [ e_cs ] ) : @xmath351 .",
    "+      as i have shown above , the expressions for the interior and scattered field depend on the incident field .",
    "in particular , their expressions depend on the intensity carried by @xmath291 .",
    "this fact naturally translates into the cross sections , _",
    "i.e. _ the cross sections depend on the intensity of the incident beam . in order to remove the intensity dependence from the cross - section expression ,",
    "we normalize the cross sections over the intensity of the beam across a transverse section @xcite : @xmath352 where @xmath353 can take three values @xmath354 .",
    "i will not give general expressions for the efficiencies .",
    "instead , i will either explicitly compute them ( see chapters [ ch3 ] and [ ch4 ] ) , or measure them ( see chapter [ ch7 ] ) . a subtlety about the measurements in chapter [ ch7 ]",
    "is in order at this point . despite normalising the scattering intensity over the power of the incident beam ( @xmath355 ) ,",
    "the result is modified by the limited na of the detector .",
    "that is , the definitions of cross section and efficiency factors given by equations ( [ c1]-[c5 ] ) and ( [ e_efficiency ] ) suppose that the scattering in all angles @xmath356 is collected . however , this is not the case in the experiments done in chapter [ ch7 ] .",
    "there , only scattered light in the backward semi - space is collected .",

    "`` i think it only makes sense to seek out and identify structures of authority , hierarchy , and domination in every aspect of life , and to challenge them ; unless a justification for them can be given , they are illegitimate , and should be dismantled , to increase the scope of human freedom .

    ", the vertical axis displays the efficiency of the slm measured in the way it has been described above ; whilst the horizontal axis displays the polarization angle .",
    "this polarization angle is a direct readout of the angular position of a rotation - mount where a half - wave plate is hold .",
    "hence , the value is arbitrary , as a rotation of the slm would make it vary .",
    "however , the number is given so that it can be checked how the maximum is displaced when the slm is tilted .",
    "the first conclusion that can be drown from figures [ fig614 ] and [ fig615 ] is that the efficiency significantly depends on the polarization of the incident beam .",
    "second , it is observed that when the angle between the normal to the slm and the beam axis increases , the efficiency decreases more rapidly for a same range of variation of polarization degrees .",

    "figure [ fig615 ] , which depicts the efficiency data obtained when the angle between the incident beam and the normal to the slm is 5 degrees , shows that a 10 degree variation in polarization is matched with a 12@xmath479 variation in efficiency .",

    "obviously , as given by equation ( [ e_kx ] ) , the larger number of @xmath3 phase jumps the hologram gives , the larger is the angle between the 0th and the 1st diffraction order .",
    "then , it can be observed that there is an almost linear relation between the efficiency of the slm and the number of @xmath3 phase jumps in for this range of values .",

    "<S> despite all the recent progress in the field , nanophotonics is still a step behind nanoelectronics in transmitting information using nanometric circuits . </S>",
    "<S> a lot of effort is being put into making very elaborate structures that can guide light and control light - matter interactions at the nano - scale . </S>",
    "<S> the field of plasmonics has been especially successful in this . in this thesis , </S>",
    "<S> a different approach is taken to control the light - matter interactions at the nano - scale . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is based on considering light and sample as a whole system and exploiting its symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to this new perspective , new phenomena have been unveiled . </S>",
    "<S> these new phenomena have been developed theoretically and/or experimentally and are scattered across this thesis . </S>",
    "<S> + in chapter [ ch1 ] , the theoretical grounds of this thesis are settled . even though every physicist is familiar with the concept of symmetry , a formalism to systematically describe the symmetries of electromagnetic fields is explained . with this formalism , some well - known symmetry considerations can be as easily retrieved as some much less intuitive . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it can be demonstrated that a linearly polarised bessel beam is not cylindrically symmetric ; whilst a circularly polarised bessel beam is both cylindrically and dual symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the mathematical tools to describe non - paraxial electromagnetic fields are given . </S>",
    "<S> due to the fact that this work deals with sub - wavelength scatterers , the light - matter interaction can not usually be described within the paraxial approximation . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the polarisation and intensity profile of the light beams can not be modified independently as they are linked via the maxwell equations . </S>",
    "<S> + chapters [ ch2 ] , [ ch3 ] and [ ch4 ] deepen in the study of generalized lorenz - mie theory . using the formalism developed in chapter [ ch1 ] , various new effects are discovered . in chapter </S>",
    "<S> [ ch3 ] , the excitation of wgm modes on micron - sized spheres is described . indeed , using cylindrically symmetric beams </S>",
    "<S> , light can be coupled into spherical resonators without the use of evanescent coupling . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is shown that the use of cylindrically symmetric modes also allows for the enhancement of the ripple structure in scattering . </S>",
    "<S> finally , chapter [ ch4 ] generalizes the kerker conditions and uses cylindrically and dual symmetric beams to control the helicity content in scattering . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that non - dual materials such as tio@xmath0 spheres can behave as dual if the correct excitation beam and wavelength is used to illuminate them . </S>",
    "<S> + chapters [ ch5 ] , [ ch6 ] and [ ch7 ] are devoted to experiments . in chapter [ ch5 ] , a description of the experimental techniques used in chapters [ ch6 ] and [ ch7 ] is carried out . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the basics of spatial light modulators and computer generated holograms are given . </S>",
    "<S> spatial light modulators are used in chapters [ ch6 ] and [ ch7 ] to create vortex beams . in chapter </S>",
    "<S> [ ch6 ] , the symmetries of these vortex beams turn out to be crucial to induce a giant circular dichroism in a non - chiral sample . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the far - field transmission of vortex beams through a sub - wavelength nano - aperture is shown for the first time </S>",
    "<S> . finally , chapter [ ch7 ] presents the dependence of scattering measurements on the wavelength and the topological charge of the incident vortex beam . </S>",
    "<S> as predicted in chapter [ ch3 ] , it is seen that some scattering resonances are hidden under a gaussian beam excitation . </S>",
    "<S> these resonances can be unveiled when the illumination is a vortex beam . </S>",
    "<S> + overall , this work shows a number of new effects ( theoretical and/or experimental ) produced by the excitation of symmetric structures with symmetric light . </S>",
    "<S> these new discoveries will help to provide new ideas and design paths to fabricate new nanophotonic devices such as nano - antennas or nano - resonators . </S>",
    "<S> a study of the symmetries of the system should always be kept in mind for any photonic device where the spatial degrees of freedom and the polarisation can not be decoupled . </S>"
