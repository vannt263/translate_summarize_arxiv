    "the oxygen abundance is one of the fundamental characteristics of a galaxy .",
    "accurate oxygen abundances are mandatory in investigations of different aspects of the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "accurate oxygen abundances in hii regions can be derived via the classic t@xmath4 method . in the first step ,",
    "the electron temperature @xmath5 within the [ oiii ] zone and the electron temperature @xmath6 within the [ oii ] zone are determined .",
    "then the abundance is derived using the equations linking the ionic abundances to the measured line intensities and electron temperature .",
    "( the usual notation ( o / h)@xmath7 for the oxygen abundance derived with the t@xmath4 method will be used throughout the paper . )",
    "the ratio of nebular to auroral oxygen line intensities q@xmath8 = [ oiii]@xmath9/[oiii]@xmath10 is used for the t@xmath3 determination .",
    "the ratio of nebular to auroral oxygen line intensities q@xmath11 = [ oii]@xmath123727/[oii]@xmath127320+@xmath127330 or the ratio of nebular to auroral nitrogen line intensities q@xmath13 = [ nii]@xmath14/[nii]@xmath15 are used for the t@xmath0 determination .",
    "unfortunately , the auroral lines are faint and drop below detectability in the spectra of high - metallicity hii regions .",
    "this prevents the application of the t@xmath4 method to high - metallicity hii regions .",
    "is there another way to estimate electron temperature in hii region where the faint auroral lines are not detected ?",
    "the law of energy conservation for free electrons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that the electron temperature in a nebula is mainly defined by the hardness of the ionizing radiation and by the emission in the forbidden lines .",
    "since the excitation parameter p is an indicator of the hardness of the ionizing radiation , one can expect that the excitation parameter p coupled with the measured intensities of the nebular oxygen lines can be used to estimate the electron temperature in hii regions .",
    "we have suggested that the parametric calibration links the oxygen abundance to the measured nebular oxygen line intensities and the excitation parameter p ( p calibration or p method ) @xcite .",
    "( the oxygen abundance derived with the p calibration will be referred to as ( o / h)@xmath16 . ) comparisons between ( o / h)@xmath7 and ( o / h)@xmath16 abundances in hii regions with direct measurement of the electron temperature as well as the comparison between radial distributions of ( o / h)@xmath7 and ( o / h)@xmath16 abundances in the disks of a few well studied spiral galaxies show that ( o / h)@xmath16 abundances are in agreement with ( o / h)@xmath7 abundances @xcite .",
    "this indirectly confirms that the physical conditions in the hii region can be estimated via the nebular oxygen line intensities and the excitation parameter p. ( or one",
    "may also say that the physical conditions in the hii region can be estimated via the nebular oxygen line intensities only , since the excitation parameter p is expressed in terms of these lines . )",
    "if this is the case , then one can expect that the diagnostic line ratios can be expressed in terms of the intensities of the oxygen nebular lines .",
    "indeed , it has been found empirically that there is a relationship ( the ff relation ) between auroral [ oiii]@xmath10 and nebular oxygen line intensities in spectra of hii regions @xcite . in other words , the diagnostic line ratio q@xmath8 , used for the determination of the electron temperature within the [ oiii ] zone ,",
    "can be expressed in terms of the nebular oxygen line intensities .",
    "it has also been suggested that the electron temperature @xmath6 within the [ oii ] zone is related to the electron temperature @xmath5 within the [ oiii ] zone @xcite .",
    "then one can expect that the diagnostic line ratio used for the determination of the electron temperature within the [ oii ] zone , can also be expressed in terms of the nebular oxygen line intensities .",
    "the goal of this paper is to establish this relation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . a relation between the ratio of nebular to auroral nitrogen line intensities and oxygen nebular line intensities , q@xmath13 = f(r@xmath0,p ) ,",
    "is derived in section 2 . a relation between electron temperatures t@xmath0 and",
    "t@xmath3 is discussed in section 3 .",

    "the excitation parameter p can be expressed as : p = r@xmath3/(r@xmath3+r@xmath0 ) .",
    "the electron temperature @xmath6 within the o@xmath20 zone in hii regions can be derived from the diagnostic line ratio q@xmath11 or from the diagnostic line ratio q@xmath13 .",
    "it is believed that the measured q@xmath13 results in more reliable t@xmath0 value .",
    "starting from our basic idea that the diagnostic line ratio can be expressed in terms of the strong oxygen nebular line intensities , we will search for a relationship of the type q@xmath13 = f(r@xmath0,p ) here .",
    "it should be noted that the ratio of nebular to auroral nitrogen line intensities q@xmath13 = [ nii]@xmath14/[nii]@xmath15 is an indicator of the electron temperature t@xmath0 and therefore this ratio depends on the electron temperature but not on the nitrogen abundance .",

    "it should be noted however that the particular form of the analytical expression adopted here may be questioned . we have chosen a simple form , eq.([equation : ffa ] ) , but perhaps a more complex expression may give a better fit to the data .",
    "furthermore , the error in measurements of the line [ nii]@xmath15 is in excess of 20% ( as indicated in original papers ) in a number of calibrating hii regions .",

    "<S> the problem of determination of the electron temperature t@xmath0 in the o@xmath1 zone of high - metallicity hii region was examined . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the ratio of nebular to auroral nitrogen line intensities , which is an indicator of the electron temperature t@xmath0 , can be expressed in terms of the nebular line intensities of oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> this solves the problem of the determination of the electron temperature t@xmath0 , since the oxygen nebular lines are strong and , consequently , are readily observable . </S>",
