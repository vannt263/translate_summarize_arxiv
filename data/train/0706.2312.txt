    "quantum entanglement , as one of the most spectacular features of quantum mechanics contrasting with classical physics @xcite , has been widely investigated in the last decades , mainly because it is recognized as a crucial resource for quantum information processing and quantum communication @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a problem of great interest to find physical systems where the entanglement can be produced , manipulated and detected .",
    "recently there have been different proposals to produce entangled states , such as those based on atomic systems @xcite , quantum electrodynamics cavities @xcite and solid state devices @xcite . among the systems proposed for the realization of quantum information processing devices , those constructed with semiconductor quantum dots ( qds )",
    "are extremely promising due mainly to the controllability of their quantum state @xcite .",
    "indeed , semiconductor qds posses many desirable features : an atomic - like structure , that can be fully controlled by an external electrostatical potential ; a tunable coupling to source and drain leads , which makes feasible the integration with other microelectronics devices ; and the scalability , which seems to promise sophisticate engineering of the multi - qd structures .",
    "qds represent also an ideal laboratory to compare exact numerical simulations of the quantum transport phenomena with experiments , since the number of degrees of freedom involved is often small and the discreteness of qd states highly reduces the computational burden needed . various effects such as the conductance quantization @xcite , the coulomb blockade due to the electron repulsion @xcite , the interplay between resonances and the charging in qd structures @xcite , strongly affect the transport properties .",
    "another peculiar feature of the electron transmission through qds is the partial retention of quantum coherence @xcite , whose measurement , by experimental setups exploiting quantum interference ( e.g. with a qd embedded in an aharonov - bohm interferometer ) , may yield information about transport phenomena , not readily available from conductance measures @xcite .    in the frame of quantum transport in semiconductors ,",
    "theoretical and experimental investigations have revealed other mechanisms governing the electronic transmission through qd structures . in particular it has been observed that two kinds of resonances can be present in conductance spectra , known as _ fano _ and _ breit - wigner _",
    "resonances @xcite .",
    "the formers are present when two transmission channels , a resonant one and a non - resonant one , interfere @xcite",
    ". moreover they exhibit typical asymmetrical line shapes , with the transmitted phase increasing by @xmath0 on the resonance peak and then dropping abruptly .",
    "the latters show a symmetric line shape and may be considered a limiting case of fano resonances , occurring , for example , when there is a single channel @xcite .",
    "in this paper we address the problem of entanglement generation in a two - particle scattering in a qd structure .",
    "we analyze , in particular , the role played by some mechanisms of charge transport in the appearance of quantum correlations . to this aim",
    "we consider a scattering event in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) double - barrier resonant tunnelling device ( that mimics the confining potential of the qd ) , with an electron incoming from one lead and another electron bound in the ground state of the qd .",
    "the two particles feel the confining potential inside the device and interact through the coulomb repulsion .",
    "indeed carrier - carrier entanglement has been recently investigated in various qd structures @xcite where different scattering setups are considered for the generation of two - electron entangled states . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt a time - independent few - particle approach that , although computational demanding , can be solved numerically to obtain the exact modulus and phase of the transmission coefficient ( tc ) of an electron crossing the charged qd .",
    "this gives us the possibility to quantify the quantum correlation between the energy states of the scattered electron and the bound one , and to expose its connection with the resonances exhibited by the tcs of the various scattering channels .",
    "unlike previous works @xcite , the few - particle approach we use in this paper allows us to study the relation between the different kinds of resonances , or the number of energy levels available , with the entanglement formation .",
    "even if the dynamics of carriers has been considered as 1d , we can assume that the results obtained describe a general behavior concerning also quantum transport in 2d and 3d physical systems , being the appearance of quantum correlations closely related to the nature of transport resonances , whose underlying mechanisms are independent from the dimensionality of the system",
    ".    the paper is organized as follow . in sec .",
    "[ physicalmodel ] we describe the physical model and the numerical approach adopted to calculate the two - particle scattering state and the quantum correlations in terms of the von neumann entropy . in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] we present the numerical results obtained for the entanglement in the case of two different kinds of processes , namely two- and multi - channel scattering .. ] finally in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we comment the results , draw final remarks and point out issues that require further research .",
    "our aim is to evaluate the entanglement between the energy states of two electrons , interacting via the coulomb potential , one bound in a qd and the other passing through it .",
    "here we summarize the physical model adopted for the open qd and the numerical approach used to evaluate the two - particle scattering state and the entanglement .",
    "we consider a quasi 1d double - barrier resonant tunnelling device as , for example , the ones formed by material modulation in a ultrathin cylindrical nanowire @xcite .",
    "the transversal dimensions of the structure are small compared to the other lenghtscales so that a single transversal subband is accessible to the carriers and the effective dynamics can be considered 1d @xcite .",
    "two small potential barriers separate the qd region from the two contacts , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) . the @xmath1 bound states and energies of the qd will be indicated as @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 in order of increasing energy ) , respectively .",
    "a single electron is in the qd ground state @xmath5 , whereas a second electron is incoming from the left lead with energy @xmath6 , and it is scattered by the structure potential @xmath7 and by the coulomb interaction with the bound particle .",
    "the potential @xmath7 is supposed to be constant outside the region of interest of length @xmath8 and , without loss of generality , it is taken to be zero in both left and right contacts .",
    "we will consider only cases in which the energy of the incoming electron is not sufficient to ionize the qd , i.e. @xmath9 .",
    "this means that when an electron leaves the scattering region , either reflected or transmitted , the other one is in a bound state of the dot .",
    "the two - particle hamiltonian reads : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the electron effective mass and the dielectric constant of the material , respectively .",
    "in particular the calculations presented in this paper have been performed using gaas material parameters .",
    "the coulomb term includes the thickness a cut - off term @xmath13 that can be assumed to correspond roughly to the lateral dimension of the confinement @xcite .",
    "the spin degree of freedom does not enter into our calculation since we neglect spin - orbit coupling . as a consequence of the fermionic nature of the system we impose antisymmetrization constraints under particle exchange to the wavefunction @xmath14 .",
    "this is done by adopting antisymmetric boundary conditions as briefly described in the following and detailed in ref .  .",
    "the two - particle scattering state is obtained by solving the time - independent open - boundary schrdinger equation @xmath15 in the 2d domain of interest . to this aim",
    "we have used a numerical approach , based on a generalization of the widely used _ quantum transmitting boundary method _ @xcite .",
    "it allows us to include proper open boundary conditions and simulate the scattering of one electron by a charge confined in a qd @xcite . in particular here we need four boundary conditions , one for each edge of the square domain . since we have to impose exchange symmetry to @xmath14 , they are equal in couples , apart from the sign . in fact the form of the wavefunction when particle @xmath16 is in the left lead ( @xmath17 ) is @xmath18 and , when it is particle @xmath19 the one in the left lead , the boundary condition is @xmath20 . for the other two boundaries , namely the conditions ( @xmath21 ) and ( @xmath22 ) it holds @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "let us now describe the above expressions .",
    "we first define @xmath25 as the energy of an electron freely propagating in the lead when the other one is bound in @xmath2 ( a consequence of energy conservation ) , and @xmath26 . the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ boundaryleft ] ) ( for the left boundary ) is the sum of three terms .",
    "the first one represents an electron incoming as a plane wave with energy @xmath27 , while the other electron is in the qd ground state @xmath5 .",
    "the second term accounts for all the energy - allowed possibilities with one electron bound in the @xmath2 state , and the other one reflected in the left lead , with wave vector @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the number of states for which @xmath30 is positive .",
    "the third term accounts for the cases @xmath31 , representing the electron in the lead as an evanescent wave . the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ boundaryright ] ) ( for the right boundary ) has only two terms , since the probability amplitude of a carrier incoming from the right lead is zero in our system .",
    "the first term represents the @xmath29 energy - allowed possibilities of an electron transmitted and freely propagating in the right lead and the second term includes the outgoing - particle evanescent waves , as in eq .",
    "( [ boundaryleft ] ) . the reflection and transmission amplitudes in the various energy levels , @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively ,",
    "are unknowns and are obtained by solving the schrdinger equation with @xmath34 given by eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) and with the two - particle energy @xmath35 , imposing the two boundary conditions of eqs .",
    "( [ boundaryleft ] ) and ( [ boundaryright ] ) .    in order to describe the mechanisms characterizing the charge transport through a qd , and the kind of resonances showing up in transmission spectra",
    ", we report in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] the modulus and phase of the tc as a function of the initial energy of the incoming electron , for a given configuration of the potential sketched in the panel ( a ) .",
    "in particular we consider a width @xmath36 of the potential well of 80 nm with a depth @xmath37 of 150 mev . in this case",
    "we have a single - channel scattering , i.e. the scattered particle can have a single energy , while the bound one is always left in the ground state of the qd well .",
    "when @xmath6 is around 1.5 mev , the tc shows a breit - wigner resonance , as shown in panel ( b)@xcite . as it is well known , such kinds of resonances stem from the coupling of a quasi - bound state to the scattering states in the leads and presents a lorentzian line - shape whose amplitude @xmath38 is described by the expression @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a complex constant , @xmath41 the width of the resonance , inversely proportional to the lifetime of the quasi - bound state with energy @xmath42 .",
    "in particular , as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) , the tc modulus ( solid line ) goes to 1 with a symmetric lorentzian peak around the energy resonance , while the transmission phase ( dashed line ) smoothly changes by @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the above resonance two extremely sharp resonances for @xmath6 around 0.3 mev and 0.6 mev , are present .",
    "they are the so - called fano resonances ( with asymmetric line - shape ) , which can be ascribed to an effect brought about by electron - electron correlation @xcite .",
    "in fact they originated from the interference between a resonant mechanism , due to the coulomb blockade in the qd , and a non - resonant mechanism , given by the transmission in the dot via a direct trajectory @xcite . in order to give a better insight into their properties",
    "we have reported in the top panel ( c ) a zoom of the modulus and phase of the tc at an initial energy of the incoming electron @xmath6 around 0.3 mev . here",
    "the modulus reaches 1 and then goes to zero , showing the typical asymmetric fano lineshape .",
    "the transmission phase increases smoothly by @xmath0 on the resonance peak , but shows an abrupt drop of @xmath0 in correspondence of the zero of the transmission probability @xcite .",
    "we stress that the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] correspond to a single - channel two - particle scattering , with the energy of the transmitted electron fixed by the boundary conditions . as a consequence",
    ", no entanglement is generated between the two electrons here .",

    "in fact as a consequence of the scattering , quantum correlations appear between the energy levels @xmath3 of the electron bound in the potential well and the energies @xmath30 of the scattered electron allowed by energy conservation .",
    "such an entanglement may be evaluated from the transmitted component of the two - particle wavefunction in the right lead , given by eq .",
    "( [ boundaryright ] ) .",
    "obviously only the travelling components , with @xmath45 in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ boundaryright ] ) , must be considered , since they are the only ones giving a non vanishing contribution to the current and also the only ones that could be revealed by measuring the energy of the electron propagating in the right lead . on the other hand the evanescent component of the wavefunction plays no direct role in the appearance of detectable quantum correlations . in this case , a good entanglement measure is given by the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath46 , obtained by tracing the two - particle density matrix @xmath47 over the degrees of freedom of one of the particles @xcite , where @xmath48 .",

    "we estimate the entanglement between the dot and the _ transmitted _ electron .",
    "in fact , in our approach the measure of the entanglement created in the system , evaluated by means of eq .",
    "( [ formu ] ) , is not explicitely given in terms of the device transmission and reflection coefficients , but it is a function of the amplitude probabilities of finding the transmitted particle in one of the possible energy states .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noting that , although we do not use explicitely the criteria developed to treat the entanglement of identical particles @xcite , the electrons in our system are fully indistinguishable .",
    "nevertheless , since the energy of the incoming electron is not sufficient to ionize the qd , we may safely assume that the scattered particle is far enough from the one left in a bound state of the dot so that the overlap between their spatial probabilities is negligible . in other words",
    "we use the spatial position of the electrons to `` distinguish '' them , while the entanglement is between their energy states , as suggested in ref . .",
    "in this section we analyze the entanglement formation in a two- or multi - channel scattering , and its relation to the resonances in the tcs . in particular , it is of interest to study how the entanglement depends upon the kind of resonances , since the detection of the latter , usually feasible through a current - voltage characteristic of the quantum device , can give information about the former . in our approach",
    "we solve numerically the system for different potentials @xmath43 ( obtained by varying the depth @xmath37 and the width @xmath36 of the well ) , and for different initial energies of the incoming electron @xmath6 . in panel",

    "[ fig:2](b ) , we observe that the maxima of the entanglement spread in the region corresponding to a three - channel scattering , that is separated by the dashed line from the one where the number of active channels is two . this suggests us that also the kind of process , i.e. two- or multi - channel scattering , plays an important role into the entanglement formation .",

    "[ fig:3 ] we report the entanglement as a function of the kinetic energy of the incoming particle , for the potential sketched in the inset of the figure . in particular we consider a width of the potential well of 30 nm and a depth of @xmath62 mev . at low energies",
    "the scattering does not lead to the appearance of quantum correlations between the two particles , since only a single channel is possible for the transmission .",
    "it is therefore possible to attribute a specific energy to each particle : @xmath58 for the scattered electron and @xmath60 for the bound one .",

    "[ fig:4 ] a zoom of the curves of modulus and phase ( the latter was not shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig:3 ] , for clarity ) of the tcs of the two channels .",
    "it is worth noting that , unlike the case of the single - channel scattering , here the modulus of the tc attains small but non zero values before the maximum , which , in turn , results to be significantly lower than 1 .",
    "the tc of channel 1 shows , in correspondence of the fano resonance of channel 0 , a breit - wigner resonance characterized by a phase change of about @xmath0 . in the energy interval around 15",
    "mev the behavior of the quantum correlations , appearing in the systems as a consequence of the scattering , is peculiar ( see the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "in fact when the modulus of the tc of the channel 0 reaches its lowest value , the entanglement curve presents a minimum .",
    "such a minimum is placed between two very close maxima , where the entanglement ( evaluated , as usual , by means of the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix ) is equal to @xmath63 .",
    "this value indicates the condition of maximal entanglement in a two - channel scattering .",
    "such a condition is reached when @xmath64 and @xmath65 , i.e. the probabilities that the scattering occurs through the channel 0 or 1 , respectively , are equal , and it implies that the lack of knowledge about the state in the one - particle subspace is maximum .",

    "note that , while @xmath53 can range from 0 ( no entanglement ) to @xmath63 ( maximally entangled state ) , the bottom of the left scale is set to 0.25 to optimize the magnification effect in the figure .",

    "even if the modulus of the tc becomes equal to 1 , the entanglement curve does not display maxima or minima .",
    "this is due to the fact that the breit - wigner resonance of the tc of channel 0 does not influence the tc of channel 1 , which does not show , at the specific energy , resonances of any kind .",

    "in fact , we observe , from the uppermost inset that also in this case the modulus of the tc has a local minimum before reaching the maximum . the type of resonances of channels 1 and 2 ( middle and bottom insets ) can not be clearly identified by the module of their transmission coefficients , whose peaks are almost symmetric",
    ". however , it is clear for the transmission phases , that channel 1 exhibits a fano resonance , with the phase essentially unchanged through the peak , while channel 2 shows a breit - wigner resonance , with a global phase variation of @xmath0 .",
    "we stress that , unlike the two - channel scattering case , here the entanglement does not show a minimum .",
    "such a behavior can be ascribed to the fact that , when the modulus of the tc of channel 0 is small , the tcs of the other two channels attain values comparable to each other .",
    "this means that the probabilities of finding the scattered particles in those channels are almost equal , and there is still a lack of knowledge about the state of the one - particle subsystem .",
    "furthermore , we note that here the entanglement presents a single maximum whose value exceeds @xmath63 . actually , the fact that the number of degrees of freedom is larger than 2 increases the uncertainty about the constituents of the system ; in fact eq .  ( [ formu ] )",
    "gives a maximum value for the amount of quantum correlations that is larger for a larger number of possible states .",
    "for example , a system of two qutrits is able to attain a larger value of @xmath53 than a two - qubit system . the ability to tailor not only the degree of the entanglement , but also the number of possible states of the two subsystems , by independently tuning @xmath6 and the qd confining potential , could also have implications beyond the theoretical estimation of the entanglement .",

    "it permits us to obtain the reflection and transmission amplitudes of each scattering channel , for various configurations of the potential , as a function of the initial energy of the incoming electron .",

    "a breit - wigner resonance is essentially a one - particle effect , showing up also in a single - electron scattering . on the other hand ,",
    "a fano resonance is a genuine multi - particle phenomenon , due to electron - electron correlation , and is not present for single - particle systems .",

    "for the two - channel case , the entanglement presents a minimum between two close maxima , which indicate the maximal uncertainty about the state of the system . in the multi - channel case ,",
    "a single maximum of the entanglement , with no minima , is observed .",
    "when the energy levels of the scattered and bound electrons are only two , the minimum of the entanglement is found in correspondence of the local minimum of the tc of the fano resonant channel . in this case",
    "it maximizes the possibility to ascribe specific energy states to the subsystems . on the other hand , for a multi - channel scattering",
    ", a minimum of tc of a fano resonant channel does not imply a decrease of uncertainty about the subsystems , since the tcs of the other non fano resonant channels attain values comparable to each other .    finally , the results of our paper suggest that the manipulation of fano resonances and of the number of scattering channels may allow to significatively influence the degree of entanglement between the transmitted electrons and the qd",
    ". a promising development of the present work could be the study of the entanglement in the case of scattering of a single electron by a few charges confined in the qd , in connection with experimental results obtained for the coherent components of the transmitted current in the case of the multi - occupancy of the dot @xcite . in the latter case , with three or more particles in the system ,",
    "the spin degrees of freedom can not be factorized and their inclusion in our approach , although quite feasible , results very challenging form the computational point of view ."
