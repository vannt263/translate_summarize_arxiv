    "geometry has a proven history of success , helping to make impressive advances in diverse fields of science , when a geometric fabric underlying a complex problem or phenomenon is identified .",
    "examples can be found everywhere .",
    "perhaps the most famous one is general relativity , interpreting gravitation as a curved geometry .",
    "quite a contrasting example comes from the complexity theory in computer science , where apparently intractable computational problems suddenly find near optimal solutions as soon as a geometric underpinning of the problem is discovered  @xcite , leading to viable practical applications  @xcite .",
    "yet another example is the recent conjecture by palmer  @xcite suggesting that many `` mysteries '' of quantum mechanics can be resolved by the assumption that a hidden fractal geometry underlies the universe .    inspired by these observations , and following  @xcite",
    ", we develop here a geometric framework to study the structure and function of complex networks  @xcite .",
    "we begin with the assumption that hyperbolic geometry underlies these networks .",
    "although difficult to visualize , hyperbolic geometry , briefly reviewed in section  [ sec : primer ] , is by no means anything exotic .",
    "in fact it is the geometry of the world we live in .",
    "indeed , the relativistic minkowski spacetime is hyperbolic , and so is the anti - de sitter space  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "hyperbolic spaces can be thought of as smooth versions of trees abstracting the hierarchical organization of complex networks  @xcite , a key observation providing a high - level rationale , section  [ sec : motivations ] , for our hyperbolic hidden space assumption . in section  [ sec : models ] we show that from this assumption , two common properties of complex network topologies emerge naturally .",
    "namely , heterogeneous degree distributions and strong clustering appear , in the simplest possible settings , as natural reflections of the basic properties of underlying hyperbolic geometry .",
    "the exponent of the power - law degree distribution , for example , turns out to be a function of the hyperbolic space curvature .",
    "fortunately , unlike in  @xcite , for instance , we can directly verify our assumption . in section  [ sec : model_equivalence ]",
    "we consider the converse problem , and show that if a network has some metric structure  tests for its presence are described in  @xcite  and if the network s degree distribution is heterogeneous , then the network does have an effective hyperbolic geometry underneath .",
    "many different pieces start coming together in section  [ sec : fermi ] , where we show that the ensembles of networks in our framework can be analyzed using standard tools in statistical mechanics .",
    "hyperbolic distances between nodes appear as energies of corresponding edges distributed according to fermi - dirac statistics . in this interpretation , auxiliary fields , which have been considered as opaque variables in the standard exponential graph formalism  @xcite , turn out to be linear functions of underlying distances between nodes .",
    "the chemical potential , boltzmann constant , etc . , also find their lucid geometric interpretations , while temperature appears as a natural parameter controlling clustering in the network .",
    "the network ensemble exhibits a phase transition at a specific value of temperature , caused  as usual  by a non - analyticity of the partition function .",
    "this phase transition separates two regimes in the ensemble , cold and hot .",
    "complex networks belong to the cold regime , while in the hot regime , the standard configuration model  @xcite and classical random graphs  @xcite turn out to be two limiting cases with degenerate geometric structures , section  [ sec : random_graphs ] .",
    "sections  [ sec : degree_distribution ] and  [ sec : clustering ] analyze the degree distribution and clustering as functions of temperature in the two regimes .    finally , in section  [ sec : simulations ] , we shift our attention to network function .",
    "specifically , we analyze the network efficiency with respect to targeted communication or transport processes without global topology knowledge , made possible by our geometric approach .",
    "we find that such processes in networks with strong heterogeneity and clustering , guided by the underlying hyperbolic space , achieve the best possible efficiency according to all measures , and that this efficiency is remarkably robust with respect to even catastrophic levels of network damage .",
    "this finding demonstrates that complex networks have the optimal structure , allowing for routing with minimal overhead approaching its theoretical lower bounds , a notoriously difficult longstanding problem in routing theory , proven unsolvable for general graphs  @xcite .",
    "in this section we review the basic facts about hyperbolic geometry .",
    "more detailed accounts can be found in  @xcite .",
    "there are only three types of isotropic spaces : euclidean ( flat ) , spherical ( positively curved ) , and hyperbolic ( negatively curved ) .",
    "hyperbolic spaces of constant curvature are difficult to envisage because they can not be isometrically embedded into any euclidean space .",
    "the reason is , informally , that the former are `` larger '' and have more `` space '' than the latter .    because of the fundamental difficulties in representing spaces of constant negative curvature as subsets of euclidean spaces , there are not one but many equivalent models of hyperbolic spaces .",
    "each model emphasizes different aspects of hyperbolic geometry , but no model simultaneously represents all of its properties . in special relativity , for example",
    ", the hyperboloid model is commonly used , where the hyperbolic space is represented by a hyperboloid .",
    "its two different projections to disks orthogonal to the main axis of the hyperboloid yield the klein and poincar unit disk models . in the latter model , the whole infinite hyperbolic plane @xmath0 , i.e.",
    ", the two - dimensional hyperbolic space of constant curvature @xmath1 , is represented by the interior of the euclidean disk of radius  @xmath2 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : poincare ] .",
    "the boundary of the disk , i.e. , the circle @xmath3 , is not a part of the hyperbolic plane , but represents its infinitely remote points , called boundary at infinity @xmath4 .",
    "any symmetry transformation on @xmath5 translates to a symmetry on @xmath4 , and _ vice versa _",
    ", a cornerstone of the anti - de sitter space / conformal field theory correspondence  @xcite , where quantum gravity on an anti - de sitter space is equivalent to a quantum field theory without gravity on the conformal boundary of the space .",
    "hyperbolic geodesic lines in the poincar model , i.e. , shortest paths between two points at the boundary , are disk diameters and arcs of euclidean circles intersecting the boundary perpendicularly .",
    "the model is conformal , meaning that euclidean angles between hyperbolic lines in the model are equal to their hyperbolic values , which is not true with respect to distances or areas .",
    "euclidean and hyperbolic distances , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , from the disk center , or the origin of the hyperbolic plane , are related by @xmath8 the model is generalizable for any dimension @xmath9 , in which case @xmath10 is represented by the interior of the unit ball whose boundary @xmath11 is the boundary at infinity @xmath12 . the model is related via the stereographic projection to another popular model  the upper half - space model  where @xmath10 is represented by a `` half '' of @xmath13 span by vectors @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "the boundary at infinity @xmath12 in this case is the hyperplane @xmath16 instead of @xmath11 .",
    "essentially any @xmath17-dimensional space @xmath18 with a @xmath19-dimensional boundary can be equipped with a hyperbolic metric structure , with the @xmath18 s boundary playing the role of the boundary at infinity @xmath20 .",
    "given the abundance of hyperbolic space representations , we are free to choose any of those , e.g. , the one most convenient for our purposes .",
    "unless mentioned otherwise , we use the _ native _ representation in the rest of the paper . in this representation ,",
    "all distance variables have their true hyperbolic values . in polar coordinates , for example , the radial coordinate @xmath21 of a point is equal to its hyperbolic distance from the origin .",
    "that is , instead of  ( [ eq : re.vs.rh ] ) , we have @xmath22    a key property of hyperbolic spaces is that they expand faster than euclidean spaces .",
    "specifically , while euclidean spaces expand polynomially , hyperbolic spaces expand exponentially .",
    "in the two - dimensional hyperbolic space @xmath23 of constant curvature @xmath24 , @xmath25 , for example , the length of the circle and the area of the disk of hyperbolic radius @xmath21 are @xmath26 both growing as @xmath27 with @xmath21 .",
    "the hyperbolic distance @xmath28 between two points at polar coordinates @xmath29 and @xmath30 is given by the hyperbolic law of cosines @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the angle between the points .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : hyperbolic - circle - length]-[eq : x - zeta ] ) converge to their familiar euclidean analogs at @xmath33 . for sufficiently large @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ,",
    "the hyperbolic distance @xmath28 is closely approximated by @xmath37 that is , the distance between two points is approximately the sum of their radial coordinates , minus some @xmath38-dependent correction , which goes to zero at @xmath39 .",
    "hyperbolic spaces are similar to trees . in a @xmath40-ary tree ( a tree with branching factor @xmath40 ) , the analogies of the circle length or disk area are the number of nodes at distance exactly @xmath21 or not more than @xmath21 hops from the root .",
    "these numbers are @xmath41 and @xmath42/(b-1)$ ] , both growing as @xmath43 with @xmath21 .",
    "we thus see that the metric structures of @xmath23 and @xmath40-ary trees are the same if @xmath44 : in both cases circle lengths and disk areas grow as @xmath27 . in other words , from the purely metric perspective ,",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath40-ary trees are equivalent .",
    "informally , trees can therefore be thought of as `` discrete hyperbolic spaces . ''",
    "formally , trees , even infinite ones , allow nearly isometric embeddings into hyperbolic spaces .",
    "for example , any tessellation of the hyperbolic plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : poincare ] ) naturally defines isometric embeddings for a class of trees formed by certain subsets of polygon sides . for comparison",
    ", trees do not generally embed into euclidean spaces .",
    "informally , trees need an exponential amount of space for branching , and only hyperbolic geometry has it .",
    ".characteristic properties of euclidean , spherical , and hyperbolic geometries . _ parallel lines _ is the number of lines that are parallel to a line and that go through a point not belonging to this line , and @xmath46 .",
    "[ table : geometries ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]             here , we finish the description and analysis of our geometric model of complex networks . to summarize ,",
    "the model can produce scale - free networks with any average degree @xmath47 , power - law exponent @xmath48 , and average clustering @xmath49 , controlled , respectively , by parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the @xmath3 and @xmath5 formulations of the model , see table  [ table : parameters ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : model.vs.internet ] we observe a good match between the basic topological properties of the real internet and a synthetic network generated by the @xmath5 model with an appropriate choice of parameters in the cold regime . in the hot regime",
    "the model subsumes the standard configuration model and classical random graphs as two different limiting cases with degenerate geometric structures .",
    "in this section we shift our attention from the analysis of the structure of complex networks in our model to the analysis of their function . specifically , we are interested in their navigation efficiency .    one important function that many real networks perform is to transport information or other media .",
    "examples include the internet , brain , or signaling , regulatory , and metabolic networks .",
    "the information transport in these networks is not akin to diffusion .",
    "instead information must be delivered to specific destinations , such as specific hosts in the internet , neuron groups in the brain , or genes and proteins in regulatory networks . in the latter case",
    ", for example , the network reacts to an increased concentration of some sugar by expressing not all but very specific proteins , the ones responsible for digesting this sugar . at the same time the nodes in the network",
    "are not aware of the global network structure , so that the questions we face are if paths to specific destinations in the network can be found without such global topology knowledge , and how optimal these paths can be .",
    "the salient feature of our model is that it allows one to study the efficiency of such path finding without global knowledge , because our networks have underlying geometry which enables greedy forwarding  ( gf ) .",
    "since each node in the network has its address , i.e. , coordinates in the underlying hyperbolic space , a node can compute the distances between each of its neighbors in the network , and the destination whose coordinates are written in the information packet , or encoded in the signal .",
    "gf then accounts to forwarding the information to the node s neighbor closest to the destination in the hyperbolic space . since each node knows only its own address , the addresses of its neighbors , and the destination address of the packet , no node has any global knowledge of the network structure .",
    "we report simulation results for two forms of gf , _ original _ gf ( ogf ) and _ modified _ gf ( mgf ) .",
    "the ogf algorithm drops the packet if the current node is a _ local minimum _ , meaning that it does not have any neighbor closer to the destination than itself .",
    "the mgf algorithm excludes the current node from any distance comparisons , and finds the neighbor closest to the destination .",
    "the packet is dropped only if this neighbor is the same as the packet s previously visited node .",
    "these gf processes can be very inefficient .",
    "they can often get stuck at local minima , or even if they succeed reaching the destination , they can travel along paths much longer than the optimal shortest paths available in the network . furthermore , even if they are efficient in static networks , their efficiencies can quickly deteriorate in the presence of network topology dynamics , e.g. , they can be vulnerable with respect to network damage .    to estimate the gf efficiency in static networks , we compute the following metrics : ( i )  the percentage of successful paths , @xmath52 , which is the proportion of paths that reach their destinations ; ( ii )  the average hop - length @xmath53 of successful paths ; and ( iii )  the average and maximum stretch of successful paths .",
    "we consider three types of stretch .",
    "the first stretch is the standard hop stretch defined as the ratio between the hop - lengths of greedy paths and the corresponding shortest paths in the graph .",
    "we denote its average and maximum by @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the optimal paths have stretch equal to @xmath2 .",
    "the other two stretches are _",
    "hyperbolic_. they measure the deviation of the hyperbolic length , traveled by a packet along either the greedy or shortest path , from the hyperbolic distance between the source and destination .",
    "formally , let @xmath56 be a source - destination pair and let @xmath57 be the greedy or shortest path between @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and @xmath60 its hop length .",
    "further , let @xmath61 , be the hyperbolic distance between @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the hyperbolic stretch is the ratio @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the hyperbolic distance between @xmath58 and @xmath59 . for greedy paths ,",
    "we denote the average and maximum of this stretch by @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; for shortest paths those are denotes by @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the lower these two stretches , the closer the greedy and shortest paths stay to the hyperbolic geodesics , and the more congruent we say the network topology is with the underlying geometry .",
    "we first focus on static networks , where the network topology does not change , and then emulate the network topology dynamics by randomly removing one or more links from the topology . for each generated network instance",
    ", we extract the giant connected component ( gcc ) , and perform gf between @xmath70 random source - destination pairs belonging to the gcc .",
    "all the metrics converge after approximately @xmath71 source - destination pairs , but we evaluate an order of magnitude more combinations for more reliable results . the network size is @xmath72 , and the average degree is @xmath73 in all the experiments , while temperature @xmath74 only in the following two subsections .",
    "figure  [ fig : original_graph ] shows the results for static networks , averaged , for each @xmath75 , over five network instances .",
    "we see that the success ratio @xmath52 increases and path length @xmath53 and all the stretches decrease as we decrease @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "remarkably , for @xmath77 , e.g. , equal to the @xmath75 observed in the internet , ogf and mgf yield @xmath78 and @xmath79 , with the ogf s maximum stretch of @xmath2 , meaning that _ all greedy paths are shortest paths_. interestingly , the hyperbolic stretch of shortest paths ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) is slightly worse ( larger ) than of greedy paths ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) , which allows us to informally say that for small @xmath75 s , _ greedy paths are `` shorter than shortest '' _ as they are shortest hop - wise , but gf tends to select among many shortest paths those of least hyperbolic stretch .    in summary , gf is exceptionally efficient in static networks , especially for the small @xmath75 s observed in the vast majority of complex networks , including the internet .",
    "the gf efficiency is maximized in this case , and the two algorithms exhibit almost the best possible performance , with reachability reaching almost @xmath80 , and all greedy paths being optimal ( shortest ) .",
    "we next look at the gf performance in dynamic networks with link failures . for each @xmath75",
    ", we randomly select a network instance from above and remove one or more random links in it .",
    "we consider the following two link - failure scenarios .",
    "in we remove a percentage @xmath81 , ranging from @xmath82 to @xmath83 , of all links in the network , compute the new gcc , and for all source - destination pairs remaining in it , we recompute the new success ratio @xmath84 , and the average and maximum stretch @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in we provide a finer - grain view focusing on paths that used a removed link .",
    "we remove one link from the network , compute the new gcc , and for the source - destination pairs that are still in it , we find the percentage @xmath87 of successful paths , only among those previously successful paths that traversed the removed link . for these still - successful paths",
    ", we also compute the new average and maximum stretch @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we then repeat the procedure for @xmath90 random links , and report the average values for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and the maximum value for @xmath89 .",
    "figure  [ fig : link_rem ] presents the results .",
    "we see that for small @xmath75 s , the success ratio @xmath84 remains remarkably high , for all meaningful values of @xmath91 .",
    "for example , mgf on networks with @xmath77 and @xmath92 , yields @xmath93 . the simultaneous failure of @xmath94 of the links in a network such as",
    "the internet is a rare catastrophe , but even after such a catastrophe the success ratio in our synthetic networks is above @xmath95 .",
    "the average stretch @xmath85 slightly increases as we increase @xmath91 , but remains quite low .",
    "we do not show @xmath86 to avoid clutter . for @xmath77 , @xmath96 .",
    "the percentage @xmath87 of mgf paths that used a removed link and that found a by - pass after its removal is also remarkably close to @xmath80 for small @xmath75 s .",
    "the average stretch @xmath88 in scenario  2 also remains low , below @xmath97 , and the maximum stretch @xmath89 never exceeds @xmath98 .    in summary , gf is not only efficient in static networks , but its efficiency is also robust in the presence of network topology dynamics .",
    "in particular , for small @xmath75 s matching those found in real networks such as the internet , gf maintains remarkably high reachability and low stretch , even after catastrophic damages to the network .",
    "next we fix @xmath77 , and investigate the gf performance as a function of temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig : gr_vs_t ] .",
    "the picture is qualitatively similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : original_graph ] .",
    "the gf efficiency is the better , the smaller is the temperature , i.e. , the stronger the clustering , see fig .",
    "[ fig : c(t ) ] . at zero temperature where clustering is maximized",
    ", gf demonstrates the best possible performance , as discussed in section  [ sec : static_networks ] .      finally , we look at the gf performance in the configuration model and classical random graphs , which are two different degenerate cases with zero clustering in our geometric network ensemble , see section  [ sec : random_graphs ] .    to test the configuration model , we fix @xmath99 , so that @xmath100 , compute distances between nodes @xmath101 according to @xmath102 , and show the results in fig .  [",
    "fig : gr_config ] . we observe that the gf efficiency is poor in this case .",
    "the success ratio @xmath52 never exceeds @xmath103 , and drops to below @xmath94 for large @xmath75 s .",
    "this poor performance is expected .",
    "indeed , since @xmath102 , gf reduces to following the node degree gradient .",
    "each node just forwards the packet to its highest - degree neighbor @xmath104 since this neighbor has the smallest radial coordinate @xmath7 , thus minimizing the distance to the destination .",
    "if during this process the packet reaches the highest - degree hub in the network core , without visiting a node directly connected to the destination , then it gets stuck at this hub , because no angular coordinates instructing in what direction to exit the core are any longer available  a problem , which does not admit a simple and efficient solution  @xcite .    to test classical random graphs , we assign to nodes their angular coordinates",
    "@xmath105 uniformly distributed on @xmath106 $ ] , connect each node pair with the same probability @xmath107 , and compute distances according to @xmath108 .",
    "greedy forwarding is extremely inefficient in this case .",
    "the ogf and mgf average success ratios @xmath52 are @xmath109 and @xmath110 .    in summary , the hierarchical organization ( heterogeneous degree distribution ) and metric structure ( strong clustering ) in the network are both critically important for network navigability .",
    "we have seen that more heterogeneous networks ( smaller @xmath75 ) with stronger clustering ( smaller @xmath111 ) are more navigable . here , we explain why it is the case .",
    "we first recall that the congruency , measured by the hyperbolic stretch , between the network topology and hyperbolic geometry is the stronger , the smaller are the @xmath75 and @xmath111 , see figs .  [",
    "fig : original_graph],[fig : gr_vs_t ] . to visualize this effect , we draw in fig .  [",
    "fig : hierarchy](a ) a couple of gf paths and their corresponding hyperbolic geodesics .",
    "we see that the lengths of the latter are indeed dominated by the sums of the radial coordinates of the source and destination , minus some @xmath38-dependent corrections  ( [ eq : x - approx ] ) .",
    "this domination of the radial direction shapes the following hierarchical path pattern of the hyperbolic geodesics , as well as of the corresponding gf paths : ( i )  zoom - out from the network periphery to the core , moving to increasingly higher - degree nodes , that is , nodes covering increasingly wider areas by their connections , see fig .  [",
    "fig : sample_network ] ; ( ii )  turn in the core to the direction of the destination ; and finally ( iii )  zoom - in onto it , moving to lower - degree nodes .",
    "this path pattern is exactly the pattern of _ hierarchical paths _ in  @xcite .",
    "a path is called _ hierarchical _ in  @xcite if it consists of two segments : first , a segment of nodes with increasing degrees , and then a segment of nodes with decreasing degrees . as shown in  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) there ) , the percentage of shortest paths that are also hierarchical approaches @xmath80 with @xmath112 .",
    "remarkably , this hieratical path pattern also characterizes the policy - compliant paths followed by information packets in the internet  @xcite .",
    "since the gf paths , also the shortest paths in the network , follow the shortest geodesic paths in the hyperbolic space , the resulting hyperbolic stretch is small .",
    "thanks to strong clustering , the network has many partially disjoint paths between the same source and destination , which all follow the same hierarchical pattern .",
    "therefore , even if some paths are damaged by link failures , other congruent paths remain , and gf can still find them using the same hyperbolic geodesic direction , which explains the high robustness of network navigability with respect to network damage . as clustering weakens , not only the path diversity in the network decreases , but also the network metric structure deteriorates , since the edge existence probability  ( [ eq : p(x)-fermi ] ) depends less and less on the hyperbolic distance between nodes . in the extreme case of classical random graphs , for example , the connection probability does not depend on this distance at all . as a result , the congruency between network topology and underlying geometry evaporates .",
    "heterogeneity is another key element responsible for high navigability .",
    "this heterogeneity is nothing but a reflection of the hierarchical , tree - like structure of the underlying hyperbolic space .",
    "indeed , its hierarchical structure manifests itself in the hierarchy of node degrees , and in the degree - dependent amount of space that nodes cover by their connections . as fig .",
    "[ fig : sample_network ] shows , nodes of higher degrees , closer to the top of the hierarchy , cover wider areas with their connections .",
    "to quantify , at @xmath74 the angular sector @xmath113 that nodes with expected degree @xmath114 cover by their connections to nodes with expected degree @xmath115 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hierarchy](b ) , is @xmath116 .",
    "this degree - dependent hierarchy of space coverage makes the hierarchical zooming - out / zooming - in path pattern possible and successful .",
    "finally , the stronger the heterogeneity , the more bridges are in the network , where by _ bridges _ we mean nodes that connect to _ all _ nodes with expected degrees exceeding a certain threshold , an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hierarchy](c ) .",
    "this threshold is given by the equation @xmath117 , yielding that a node with expected degree @xmath114 is connected to all nodes with expected degrees @xmath118 .",
    "however such @xmath115-degree nodes may not exist in the network , as the required @xmath115 may exceed the maximum expected degree @xmath119  @xcite . requiring @xmath120 leads to @xmath121 .",
    "that is , only such @xmath114-degree nodes are expected to be bridges .",
    "the equation for the expected bridge existence is then @xmath122 , yielding @xmath123 .",
    "that is , bridges exist in any sufficiently large network with @xmath124the smaller the @xmath75 is , the more bridges and the longer they are  while networks with @xmath125 have no bridges .",
    "the role of bridges in the network core is straightforward : as soon as gf reaches a bridge , it can cross the entire network , in any direction , at one hop  @xcite . without bridges ,",
    "gf is doomed to wander along the network periphery , endangered by getting lost there at any hop .",
    "the gf success ratio in networks with @xmath125 deteriorates to zero in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "we have developed a framework to study the structure and function of complex networks in purely geometric terms . in this framework ,",
    "two common properties of complex network topologies , strong heterogeneity and clustering , turn out to be simple reflections of the basic properties of an underlying hyperbolic geometry .",
    "heterogeneity , measured in terms of the power - law degree distribution exponent , is a function of the negative curvature of the hyperbolic space , while clustering reflects its metric property .",
    "conversely , a heterogeneous network with a metric structure has an effective hyperbolic geometry underneath .",
    "this finding sheds light on self - similarity in complex networks  @xcite .",
    "the network renormalization procedure considered in  @xcite  throwing out nodes of degrees exceeding a certain threshold  is equivalent to contracting the radius of the hyperbolic disk where all nodes reside .",
    "this contraction is a homothety along the radial direction , which is a symmetry transformation of the hyperbolic space , and self - similarity of hyperbolic spaces with respect to such homothetic transformations has been formally defined and studied  @xcite .",
    "self - similarity of complex networks thus appears as a reflection of self - similarity of hyperbolic geometry , or as the invariance with respect to symmetry transformations in the underlying space .",
    "the developed framework establishes a clear connection between statistical mechanics and hyperbolic geometry of complex networks .",
    "the collection of edges in a network , for example , can be treated as a system of non - interacting fermions whose energies are the hyperbolic distances between nodes .",
    "this geometric interpretation may lead to further developments applying the standard tools of statistical mechanics to network analysis .",
    "the network ensemble in our framework subsumes the standard configuration model and classical random graphs as two limiting cases with degenerate geometric structures .",
    "the hyperbolic distance between two nodes  ( [ eq : x - approx ] ) delicately combines their radial and angular coordinates . in the configuration model",
    ", the distance degenerates to the sum of radial coordinates only , destroying the network metric structure . in classical random graphs , on the contrary",
    ", there is no radial distance dependence .",
    "the connection probability between nodes does not depend on any distances at all . as a result , not only the metric structure of a network but also its hierarchical heterogeneity gets completely destroyed .",
    "we have shown that both these properties , strong clustering and hierarchical heterogeneous organization , are critically important for navigability , which is the network efficiency with respect to targeted transport processes without global knowledge .",
    "such processes are impossible without auxiliary metric spaces since global knowledge of network topology would be unavoidable in that case .",
    "the developed framework not only provides a set of tools to study these processes , but also explains why and how strong clustering and hierarchical network organization makes them efficient .",
    "we have observed that the strongest clustering and strongest heterogeneity , often found in real networks , lead to optimal navigability .",
    "the transport efficiency is the best possible in this case , according to all efficiency measures . yet",
    "more remarkable is that this efficiency is extremely robust with respect to even catastrophic disturbances and damages to the network structure .",
    "complex networks thus appear to have the optimal structure to route information or other media through their topological fabric .",
    "no complicated and artificial routing schemes or constructions , impossible in nature anyway , turn out to be needed to route information optimally through a complex network .",
    "its geometric underpinning drastically simplifies the routing function , making efficient the `` dumb '' strategy of transmitting information in the right hyperbolic direction toward the destination .",
    "does signaling in real networks , such as cell signaling pathways or the brain , follow hyperbolic geodesics , and if it does then what network perturbations might break this signaling , potentially causing ( lethal ) diseases ? to answer these questions , one has first to map a real network to its underlying space , finding the coordinates for each node .",
    "in our recent work to reduce the routing complexity in the internet  @xcite , we map the internet to its hyperbolic space using statistical inference methods .",
    "these methods work well , but require substantial manual intervention , and do not scale to large networks .",
    "an interesting open problem is thus to find _ constructive _ mapping methods , e.g. , deriving the underlying distances between nodes from their similarity measures based on node attributes and annotations in a given network .",

    "<S> we develop a geometric framework to study the structure and function of complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that hyperbolic geometry underlies these networks , and we show that with this assumption , heterogeneous degree distributions and strong clustering in complex networks emerge naturally as simple reflections of the negative curvature and metric property of the underlying hyperbolic geometry . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , we show that if a network has some metric structure , and if the network degree distribution is heterogeneous , then the network has an effective hyperbolic geometry underneath . </S>",
    "<S> we then establish a mapping between our geometric framework and statistical mechanics of complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> this mapping interprets edges in a network as non - interacting fermions whose energies are hyperbolic distances between nodes , while the auxiliary fields coupled to edges are linear functions of these energies or distances . </S>",
    "<S> the geometric network ensemble subsumes the standard configuration model and classical random graphs as two limiting cases with degenerate geometric structures . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that targeted transport processes without global topology knowledge , made possible by our geometric framework , are maximally efficient , according to all efficiency measures , in networks with strongest heterogeneity and clustering , and that this efficiency is remarkably robust with respect to even catastrophic disturbances and damages to the network structure . </S>"
