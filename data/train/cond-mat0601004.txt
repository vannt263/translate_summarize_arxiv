    "the matter wave beam splitters are nowadays the cornerstone of a wide range of experiments , from atomic clocks and gravito - inertial sensors to laser cooling and ultracold atoms characterization , quantum computing and cavity qed experiments , atom lithography and chemical reaction dynamics , detection of tiny effects of general relativity and test of fundamental theories , measurement of atom surface interactions ...    in view of the recent progress in non - dissipative atom optics ( coherent beam splitters , mirrors , lenses ... ) as well as in dissipative atom optics ( slowing , trapping and cooling of atoms and molecules ) , it is needed to deepen our comprehension of light - matter interactions in the presence of other external potentials , like gravito - inertial or trapping potentials .",
    "in particular , the precision and stability of atom interferometers are now so outstanding @xcite that it is necessary to go beyond the former modeling of their main component , namely the beam splitters .",
    "in fact , the concept of atomic beam splitter is not confined to light - matter interactions , and can be extended to any interaction process between matter waves .",
    "it is thus possible to write the action of such atom optical elements as a s matrix between the incident and diffused matter waves , where the s matrix depends mainly on the splitting  potential , which can be material ( slits , periodic microstructures ... ) or electromagnetic ( magnetic or electric static fields , laser fields ... ) .",
    "this s matrix description is particularly useful for the modeling of atom interferometers , and more generally for any set up having a succession of such beam splitters @xcite .",
    "however , for a long time , the precision of atom optics experiments has remained low enough not to require an accurate study of matter wave beam splitters .",
    "thus , in the most common simplified modeling of these elements , only the following effects were considered : 1 ) the splitting of an incident atomic wave packet into several wave packets , 2 ) among them one was equal to the incident wave packet , up to a change of amplitude , 3 ) and where the others could differ from the incident wave packet in their central momentum , internal state , amplitude and phase . however , this practical modeling - sometimes called infinitely thin  because it amounts to neglecting the duration of the interaction - does not take into account several important effects , like the dispersive structuring of the incident wave packet ( velocity selection and sidebands , borrmann effect , anomalous dispersion ... ) , the time and space dependency of the splitting potential , the effect of relaxation processes , or the effect of other external fields during the splitting ( time - dependent gravito - inertial effects , trapping potentials ... ) .    during the last past two decades ,",
    "several authors studied some of these problems , namely : the effect of a non - trivial time dependency of the splitting potential ( for running and standing laser beam splitters ) @xcite ; the atomic borrmann effect and anomalous dispersion effect without any other external potential @xcite  or with a constant and uniform acceleration ( wkb solution @xcite ) ; the atomic splitting in a constant and uniform acceleration ( exact solution in the temporal case and wkb solution in the spatial case ) @xcite ; a common modeling for both spatial and temporal beam splitters to the first order in the splitting potential ( weak field theory ) @xcite ...    in the light of what happened in neutron optics , where the beam splitters modeling proved to be crucial to understand properly the origin of the interferometer phase shifts @xcite , it appears to be necessary to go beyond these studies , so as to provide a comprehensive modeling of the true action of a matter wave beam splitter ( strong fields theory for all the involved external fields ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we give some details on our framework and explain how to put in equation the problem of the triple interaction matter - splitting potential - other external fields .",
    "then , we detail how to transform the obtained equation in a simpler one thanks to unitary transformations ( interaction picture ) and passage into the rotating frames .",
    "we expound then how to solve this equation ( analytically or numerically , with different developments or relevant approximations ) , and we go back to the initial representation to explain how to write the effect of such beam splitters as an effective instantaneous interaction ( generalized @xmath0 scheme ) .",
    "finally , we study the atomic borrmann effect and other anomalous dispersive properties and model them in the general framework detailed in the second part .",
    "the matter wave beam splitters we consider in this paper consist of multi - level atomic systems subject to an interaction potential which couples the levels together .",
    "this interaction is usually made in the presence of other external potentials and miscellaneous relaxation processes .",
    "in fact , these atomic systems  can refer to atoms ( neutral or not ) as well as molecules , and more generally to any quantity of matter which can be coherently manipulated .",
    "furthermore , the atomic levels are not restricted to internal atomic levels , but more generally refer to energy - momentum states ( i.e. eigenstates of both the internal and kinetic hamiltonians ) .",
    "the transitions can occur between internal states only ( spectroscopy without doppler effect for example ) , external states only ( diffraction in kapitza - dirac and bragg regimes , optical stern - gerlach effect , magnetic atom mirror ... ) , or between entangled states , where the entanglement may be between the internal and external states ( stimulated raman transitions for example ) or between the previous energy - momentum states and the eigenstates of the interaction potential ( fock states of the quantized electromagnetic field for example ) .",
    "there are many techniques to coherently split a matter wave , and each of them corresponds to a particular kind of splitting potential . like the other atom optics elements , matter wave beam splitters use essentially two properties of atoms ( or molecules ) : their wave property , and their interaction with external fields , electromagnetic or material .",
    "to date , the demonstrated matter wave beam splitters are based on :    1 .",
    "atom - matter interaction : front wave division ( material slits ) @xcite , amplitude splitting ( transmission material gratings ) @xcite , reflection at crystalline surface @xcite , quantum reflection @xcite  2 .",
    "interaction with static magnetic or electric fields ( for atoms having a dipolar electric or magnetic moment ) : longitudinal stark effect @xcite , transverse and longitudinal stern - gerlach effects @xcite , magnetic mirrors @xcite , mirror for polar molecules @xcite , y shaped magnetic guides @xcite  3 .   resonant or quasi - resonant interaction with laser fields : reflection and diffraction by standing @xcite , running @xcite or evanescent @xcite laser waves ( with spatial and/or temporal working ) , optical stern - gerlach effect @xcite , stimulated raman effect @xcite and its derivatives ( adiabatic transfer @xcite , stirap @xcite , chirap @xcite  ) , magneto - optical beam splitters @xcite , x shaped dipolar guides @xcite     in this paper , we will focus on this third kind of interaction , and more generally on the beam splitters for which the two - beam approximation is valid .    as for the relaxation processes",
    ", they refer to all the processes which lead to a loss of coherence and/or a loss of atoms ( spontaneous emission , inter - atomic collisions , absorption and interaction with the material microstructures  ) . when they can not be neglected , the use of a density operator formalism is needed .",
    "other external potentials may be present during the matter wave splitting : inertial and gravitational fields , trapping potential , van der waals and casimir potentials   in this paper , we consider all the time - dependent potentials which are at most quadratic in position and momentum .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is therefore : @xmath1",
    "this includes the effect of non - uniform accelerations ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , rotations ( with an angular velocity @xmath4 such that @xmath5 for any vector @xmath6 ) , trapping potentials ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) , non - zero curvature tensor ( @xmath3 ) , gravitational waves in fermi s gauge ( @xmath3 ) or einstein s gauge ( @xmath9 ) , and all the electromagnetic potentials which can be written as a development at most quadratic in position and momentum ( @xmath10 , @xmath3 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "furthermore , to keep an overall approach , the coefficients of @xmath12 are time - dependent , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are expressed with non - diagonal 3x3 matrices .",
    "it is often possible to simplify this general framework and obtain an evolution equation between only two effective states by using some justified approximations .",
    "first , the two - beam approximation is indeed valid when only two energy - momentum eigenstates are coupled . the coupling can be direct ( for true two - level systems ) or indirect ( raman transitions , spatial beam splitters in bragg regime ) .",
    "in fact , one can show that any n - photon transition ( thanks to several running or standing laser waves ) of a multilevel atom is equivalent to an effective 1-photon transition between two atomic levels if the other levels can be adiabatically eliminated @xcite .",
    "the effective photon may not be real .",
    "for example , in the bragg regime , the wave vector of this effective photon is equal to @xmath16 and its frequency is equal to @xmath17 .",
    "eventually , the spatial and temporal structure of the true laser beams appears only in the amplitude of the effective running laser beam .",
    "second , the laser fields are considered as classical ( coherent states of the quantized electromagnetic fields ) , but the calculations which follow are also valid for a transition between two dressed states @xcite .",
    "third , we suppose that the two atomic levels have a long lifetime and we neglect all the relaxation processes listed before .",
    "however , the instability of these levels , due to spontaneous emission , can be taken into account in an approximative manner adding a non - hermitian part to the atom - laser hamitonian @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath18 is chosen equal to the usual dipolar electric hamiltonian ( without spin ) and we suppose that the other external fields are sufficiently weak to neglect their effect on the atomic levels and laser fields .    finally , the triple interaction laser - matter - other external fields  can be written as a schrdinger equation concerning two atomic states coupled by an effective running laser wave : @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath20 are the position and momentum operators , and @xmath21 the internal hamiltonian ( @xmath22 ) : @xmath23{cc}e_{b } & 0\\\\ 0 & e_{a}\\end{array } \\right )   = \\frac{e_{a}+e_{b}}{2}1+\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_{0}}{2}\\sigma_{3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the atomic transition frequency and @xmath25  the usual third pauli matrix .",
    "it is also possible to account for some relativistic effects by introducing two different masses @xcite . for simplicity",
    "however , we will not take into account these relativitic corrections and use only one atomic mass in what follows .",
    "it is generally impossible to solve directly the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) ( non - trivial time dependence of the right hand side , presence of two non - commuting operators @xmath20 and @xmath20 ) , but it is possible to simplify it with the help of well chosen unitary transformations @xcite .    the main idea of this series of transformations is to eliminate progressively the different sources of evolution ( internal and external ) of the right hand side of ( [ eq1 ] ) . as each unitary transformation corresponds to a change of frame , we can see this succession of transformations as a succession of frame changes which aims at reaching the proper frame of the atom , or , at least , at reaching a least movement frame  for the atom ( from external as well as internal points of view ) . in this especially suitable frame , it is easier to solve the evolution equation and several important pieces of information about the solution can be directly seen .",
    "first , let us go to the interaction picture with respect to @xmath21 and@xmath26 : @xmath27    with : @xmath28    and : @xmath29    where @xmath30  is the chronological dyson operator and @xmath31 an arbitrary time ( different from @xmath32 by definition ) .",
    "the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) becomes : @xmath33    where @xmath34 is defined as : @xmath35    the external hamiltonian @xmath12 being at most quadratic in position and momentum , @xmath34 depends linearly on @xmath36 and @xmath37 : @xmath38    and is simply obtained through the classical solution of the hamilton s equations .",
    "one can show that the matrices @xmath39 and @xmath40 depend on the quadratic terms of @xmath12 ( @xmath41 , @xmath9 and @xmath42 ) only , whereas @xmath43 also depends on its linear terms ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .",
    "these matrices are in fact the well known @xmath46 matrices , usually used in gaussian optics , and introduced recently in atom optics @xcite .    as far as @xmath18 is concerned , it may have diagonal terms ( ac stark shifts , slowly varying in space and time ) . however , in a first approach , we can take the latter constant and eliminate their common part by a unitary transformation .",
    "finally , @xmath18 can be taken as purely anti - diagonal : @xmath47{cc}0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ]    with : @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the amplitude of the effective running laser beam , and where @xmath50 is the rabi frequency of the atomic transition .",
    "an other important approximation is the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , which consists in neglecting the off - resonant terms ( i.e. with frequency @xmath51 ) in ( [ eq2 ] ) . in our case , this approximation is supposed to be justified . indeed , if the two effective levels are indirectly coupled through optical photons ( as for raman transitions for example ) , one can show that the bloch - siegert effect is negligible @xcite .    finally , the evolution equation is equal to : @xmath52{cc}0 & e^{-i\\phi_{op}\\left (   t , t_{1}\\right )   } \\\\",
    "e^{+i\\phi_{op}\\left (   t , t_{1}\\right )   } & 0 \\end{array } \\right )   \\left|   \\varphi_{1}\\left (   t\\right )   \\right\\rangle\\ ] ]    where @xmath53  is defined as : @xmath54    the next unitary transformation corresponds to the usual passage into the rotating frame . in fact , there is an infinity of such transformations @xcite .",
    "for example , the following family of transformations ( indexed by the real parameter @xmath55 ) : @xmath56    with : @xmath57{cc}e^{-i\\phi_{op}\\left (   t , t_{1}\\right )   .x } & 0\\\\ 0 & e^{-i\\phi_{op}\\left (   t , t_{1}\\right )   .\\left (   x-1\\right )   } \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ]    leads to the equation : @xmath58    with @xmath59  defined as : @xmath60{cc}x\\left (   \\omega-\\omega_{0}-\\overrightarrow{k}.\\overset{\\cdot}{\\overrightarrow { r_{op}}}-x\\delta\\right )   & \\omega_{0}f_{op}\\\\ \\omega_{0}f_{op } & \\left (   x-1\\right )   \\left (   \\omega-\\omega_{0}-\\overrightarrow{k}.\\overset{\\cdot}{\\overrightarrow{r_{op}}}-\\left ( x-1\\right )   \\delta\\right ) \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 is the `` generalized recoil '' : @xmath62 and where the point above letters refers to the time derivative .",
    "each value of @xmath55 corresponds to a particular evolution equation .",
    "for example , the most `` symmetric '' choice is @xmath63 , whereas the most `` physical '' choice is @xmath64 , and leads to : @xmath65{cc}\\delta_{op1 } & \\omega_{0}f_{op}\\\\ \\omega_{0}f_{op } & 0 \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 is the `` generalized detuning '' @xcite : @xmath67    i.e. , the operator which generalizes the usual `` free '' detuning in the presence of several gravitational , inertial and trapping potentials .",
    "it can also be written as : @xmath68   \\right)\\ ] ]    where @xmath69 is defined in the same way as @xmath70 @xcite : @xmath71    the expression of @xmath72 can be easily interpreted considering the energy - momentum conservation for a non - excited atom absorbing a photon ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) at the instant @xmath32 ( the considered atom is then at the position @xmath75 with the momentum @xmath76 when the absorption occurs ) : @xmath77    which gives the non - operatorial version of the condition @xmath78 ( exact resonance condition in the presence of the external potentials described by @xmath12 ) .",
    "this generalized detuning can also be expressed directly with the coefficients of @xmath12 .",
    "for example , if @xmath12 is constant , the first terms of its taylor expansion ( in @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) are found to be @xcite : @xmath81    where only the first five terms of the right hand side are non - negligible in usual experiments ( weak rotations and acceleration gradients on the earth ) .",
    "we can then use chirped laser pulses to eliminate the gravitational induced doppler shift @xmath82 and finally get back the usual `` free '' detuning .",
    "the other element of @xmath83 which may depend on the two canonical operators is the effective amplitude @xmath84 .",
    "the two main sources of its spatial dependency are its transverse profile and the speckle due to the miscellaneous optical elements used to bring the lasers to the atoms .",
    "generally , one can not neglect this speckle and the best is to map it , and then , to use the zones where the speckle is sufficiently weak .    concerning the laser transverse profile",
    ", one can show that it is seen roughly uniform by each individual atom of the initial atomic cloud ( described by a statistical mixture of wave packets ) .",
    "one can therefore replace @xmath85 in @xmath86 by its semi - classical action on a typical wave packet which evolves inside such beam splitters .",
    "for example , and as we see thereafter , @xmath87 can be approximated by : @xmath88    where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the initial central position and momentum of the considered atomic wave packet .",
    "the main result is that @xmath91 is hence now independent of @xmath20 and @xmath37 ( but is still time - dependent ) .",
    "the main problem in the integration of ( [ eq3 ] ) is that , in the general case considered in this paper , @xmath83 is a ( 2x2 ) matrix which depends both on time and on the two non - commuting canonical operators @xmath20 and @xmath37 .",
    "these are the two reasons why @xmath83 does not commute with itself at different times , and why one can not apply the common rules to integrate ( [ eq3 ] ) directly .",
    "however , in some particular cases , ( [ eq3 ] ) may depend on one time - independent operator only , and one can solve it analytically in the representation of this operator .",
    "it is thus important to list the maximum of these exactly solvable cases .",
    "this is the aim of the @xmath92 theory , initiated in @xcite , improved in @xcite and generalized recently in @xcite ( for a detailed review , see @xcite  and @xcite ) . among these exact solutions ,",
    "let us underline the landau - zener model ( solution with cylinder parabolic functions ) which accounts for the effect of a time - independent and uniform acceleration during the atomic splitting , and the rosen - zener model ( solution with hyperbolic secant functions ) which is significant in the study of matter wave solitons .",
    "some other analytical methods are particularly useful to deal with the equation ( [ eq3 ] ) : floquet theory @xcite for periodic time - dependence and its generalizations ( multi - periodic floquet method @xcite , ( t , t ) theory @xcite  ) ; bands theory ( i.e. use of bloch states ) when one can not make the rwa @xcite ; use of quasi - probabilities ( wigner and shirley representations ) and phase space functions ( q function of hushimi and kano , p distribution of glauber and sudarshan ) when some qed effects can not be neglected ( for a recent review , see @xcite )     apart from these particular exactly solvable cases , it is always possible to write the general solution of ( [ eq3 ] ) as a formal development",
    ". this development may be linear ( dyson ) or not ( magnus , fer , cayley  ) , and may preserve the unitarity ( for a review of the recent advances concerning the magnus expansion , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to the entanglement of operators @xmath20 and @xmath93 in the different terms of these developments , it is impossible to choose any representation which leads to an analytical expression of the solution .",
    "this problem can be solved either in eliminating one of the two canonical operators directly in the equation ( [ eq3 ] ) ( `` operatorial elimination method '' ) , or in approximating the generalized detuning @xmath72 , or finally in solving the equation numerically .",
    "the operatorial elimination method , which is detailed in @xcite , leads to a double development , easily calculable but rather long , which is why its use would be limited to the numerical domain . as for the approximations",
    ", one has already underlined that the effect of rotations and acceleration gradients may often be neglected in the generalized detuning ( leading to a trivial integration of ( [ eq3 ] ) ) . if not",
    ", several tactics may be used @xcite :    1 .",
    "freezing @xmath72 at a particular time ( mid - time for example ) or taking a temporal average , and choosing the resulting time - independent representation ; 2 .   or replacing @xmath20 and @xmath37 by their semi - classical value ( wkb approximation ) ; 3 .   or replacing only one of these operators ( @xmath20 for example ) by its action on the initial atomic wave packet ( or on a wave packet closer to the final solution )    when the equation ( [ eq3 ] ) is made scalar , one can use either the previous analytical methods , or the previous developments ( and truncate them when they converge , see @xcite ) , or some intermediate approaches which are based on the eigenstates of the matrix @xmath83 ( super - adiabatic scheme @xcite or successive adiabatic states method @xcite ) .",
    "the latter are extremely interesting because they directly provide important information on the solution , like the true energies of the system `` atom  laser  other external fields '' and the corresponding group velocities .",
    "several numerical methods may also be implemented ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) : magnus expansion , median exponential rule , runge - kutta method , strang - marchuk - trotter method , chebyshev or lanczos approximations ",
    "finally , we obtain a solution which is more or less close to the exact solution of ( [ eq3 ] ) : @xmath94    with the evolution operator : @xmath95    which can be written explicitely as a @xmath96 matrix between the initial and final atomic states : @xmath97{c}\\left|   b_{sol}\\left (   t\\right )   \\right\\rangle \\\\",

    ", the group velocities of the created wave packets may be identical or not ( borrmann effect , see below ) according to the value of the generalized detuning .",
    "once we have obtained the matrix @xmath98 , we can do the reverse unitary transformations of ( [ equ1 ] )  and ( [ equ2 ] ) , and go back to the initial representation .",
    "one obtains ( written here for the symmetric choice @xmath63 ) : @xmath99    which expresses the link between the general solution @xmath100 and the initial ket @xmath101 .",
    "it may be noticed that the solution depends on @xmath31 , the arbitrary time introduced to define the previous unitary transformations .",
    "this instant has no physical meaning and can be removed explicitly at each step of our calculations @xcite .",
    "however , it is more interesting to keep it and eventually assign it a particular value ( the central time of the interaction for example ) which may be useful both for calculations and the interpretation of the obtained solutions .",
    "the relevance of this instant to describe the atomic beam splitting as an equivalent instantaneous interaction ( generalized @xmath0 scheme ) will appear more clearly at the end of this part .",
    "it is easy to interpret the expression of @xmath102 by writing the typical terms @xmath103 of @xmath104 as a product of exponentials .",
    "indeed , let us consider the following initial ket : @xmath105{c}0\\\\ \\left|   a\\left (   t_{0}\\right )   \\right\\rangle \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ]    which represents the incident atomic wave packet ( atoms in the lower state @xmath106 ) .",
    "it results that the upper component of @xmath107 is : @xmath108    which can be interpreted as follows :    1 .",
    "evolution from @xmath109 to @xmath31 due to @xmath110 , i.e. to the gravito - inertial and trapping potentials described by @xmath12 2 .",
    "translation of @xmath111 in position and @xmath112 in momentum due to the term @xmath113 3 .",
    "action of the non - diagonal element of the @xmath96 matrix @xmath114 ( change of internal state and dispersive structuring ) 4 .",
    "again two translations : @xmath115 in position and @xmath116 in momentum 5 .",
    "then the external evolution from @xmath31 to @xmath32 due to @xmath12 6 .   and finally a phase factor @xmath117 with",
    "@xmath118    similarly , the lower component of @xmath102 is equal to : @xmath119    with the following similar interpretation :    1 .   evolution from @xmath109 to @xmath31 due to @xmath12 2 .",
    "translations of @xmath111 _ _ in position and of @xmath120 in momentum 3 .",
    "action of the diagonal element @xmath121 of the @xmath96 matrix ( dispersive structuring without internal change ) 4 .",
    "translations of @xmath122 _ _  _ _ in position and of @xmath123 in momentum 5 .",
    "evolution from @xmath31 to @xmath32 due to @xmath12 6 .   and a phase factor @xmath124 with    @xmath125    which differs from @xmath126 by @xmath127 .",
    "in certain conditions , the transfer matrix @xmath128 may have only a weak effect on the external state of the incident atoms .",
    "in this case , the center of the two main wave packets ( associated with the upper and lower adiabatic atomic states , see below ) evolves along the same trajectory during the splitting : it is the ( atomic ) borrmann effect .",
    "this effect is well known in dynamical diffraction of x rays @xcite , of neutron waves @xcite , and more recently of atomic waves @xcite .",
    "historically , this effect was defined as a more specific phenomenon , valid for any kind of waves diffracting in an absorbing crystal .",
    "it can be stated as : `` for a certain angle of incidence with respect to the crystal surface , the propagation of the incident wave packet inside the crystal is made with no attenuation along a unique trajectory which is orthogonal to the crystal surface '' .",
    "this particular angle of incidence is the well known bragg angle defined as : @xmath129    where @xmath90 is the central momentum of the incident wave packet and @xmath130 is the quantum of momentum which is communicated to the diffracted wave packet ( the bragg condition is written here for the first order diffraction ) .",
    "conversely , two wave packets with two different trajectories are created inside the crystal if this condition is not fulfilled ( defining the well known borrmann fan ) .",
    "furthermore , this anomalous transmission is very sensitive to the bragg condition , and any deviation from it greatly amplifies the angle between the two trajectories @xcite .    in the case of atom - laser interactions , there is no absorption of atoms and the bragg condition ( which means nothing but the energy - momentum conservation , i.e. the resonance condition ) is partly relaxed due to the atomic internal structure : @xmath131    to date , this atomic borrmann effect was only studied in the free case @xcite ( for which @xmath12 is limited to the usual kinetic hamiltonian @xmath132 ) or in the presence of a time - independent and uniform acceleration @xcite . in this paper , it is obtained in the presence of the various gravitational , inertial and trapping potentials described by @xmath12 . by the way , we will show that the common borrmann trajectory is equal to the average of the two extreme trajectories : @xmath39 @xmath133 @xmath134  ( atom absorbing a photon at the final time @xmath32 ) and @xmath39 @xmath135  ( atom absorbing a photon at the initial time @xmath109 ) .",
    "indeed , let us consider the previous example ( atoms initially in state @xmath106 ) and suppose that @xmath128 has a negligible effect on the central position and momentum of the corresponding incident wave packet . then , according to the expression ( [ eq4 ] ) and the ehrenfest theorem , we can show that the central position @xmath89 of the initial wave packet is changed into : @xmath136    where @xmath90 is its initial central momentum .    finally , thanks to some simple properties of @xmath46 matrices , we obtain the previously stated result : @xmath137\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this unique central trajectory differs by @xmath138  from the one obtained without any splitting potential .",
    "it means that , even for the atoms which are finally in the same internal state as the initial one ( no effective internal change ) , there is a non - trivial change of their central trajectory , which results in a measurable spatial shift at the end of the interaction ( see figure [ figborrmann ] ) .",
    "[ h ]    figurepraindia1.ps    as for the central momentum , we obtain similarly the two following momenta : @xmath139    which differ from each other on @xmath140 , as expected .    on the contrary , @xmath128 may have a non - negligible effect on the external state of the incident wave packet ( change of central position and momentum , respectively due to the addition of a non - trivial group velocity and to the change of momentum distribution ) . in this case",

    "from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , the obtained wave packets evolve with @xmath144 only , as before @xmath31 .",
    "eventually , we can show that the @xmath31 value which simplifies the most the previous expressions is the central time of interaction : @xmath167    [ h ]    figurepraindia2.ps    let us see now what are the features of the wave packets which appear inside the beam splitters . before studying this wave packet structuring in the general case ( i.e. in the presence of trapping and gravito - inertial potentials )",
    ", we will focus on the simple `` free '' case ( i.e. without any such other external potential ) .",
    "the study of the free case is important for at least two reasons .",
    "first , as we have seen in part [ part3 ] , the effect of the quadratic terms of @xmath12 ( rotations , gradients , trap  ) can often be neglected during the resolution of equation ( [ eq3 ] ) , and any uniform acceleration can be easily removed by modulating the laser frequency . in this case , the equation ( [ eq3 ] ) is equivalent to the one stemming from the free case .",
    "second , and as far as we know , to date , there has been no global study of matter wave beam splitters even in the simplest free case .",
    "indeed , each of the previously quoted works aims at studying only a few aspects of the atomic beam splitting : mechanical effect , internal and external splitting , group velocities   actually , the question consisting in finding what exactly goes out of an atomic beam splitter is still relevant , even for a simple laser potential ( temporal square amplitude ) and an incident gaussian matter wave packet .",
    "it is therefore necessary to specify what is the exact structuring of this incident wave packet , namely the number of created wave packets ( two main ones for each transition amplitude ) , their amplitude ( rabi oscillations , velocity selection , anomalous dispersion  ) , their group velocity ( borrmann fan ) , their central momentum and their phase , and eventually how these quantities evolve in time .",
    "the laser - atom interaction induces particular states , the adiabatic or dressed states , which are nothing but the eigenstates of the interaction .",
    "if @xmath168 is a unit amplitude square pulse between @xmath109 and @xmath32 , these adiabatic states are simply the eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , the two corresponding eigenenergies are : @xmath170   ^{2}}\\ ] ]    with @xmath171 , and the corresponding group velocities are simply obtained by deriving these dispersion relations with respect to the momentum : @xmath172    where @xmath173 is the well known `` off braggness parameter '' introduced in neutron optics @xcite and defined here as : @xmath174    as we can see on ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) , the matrices @xmath175 act on a wave packet which is shifted by a global momentum of @xmath176 or @xmath177 , depending on the initial internal state of atoms .",
    "for the example previously described ( atoms initially in the lower internal state ) , we obtain the following parameter : @xmath178    which can be called `` inelasticity parameter '' as it refers to the way the resonance condition is fulfilled @xcite . in the initial representation ,",
    "these group velocities become : @xmath179    the examination of these velocities leads to several important conclusions .",
    "first , the difference between momentum and group velocity in the presence of an electromagnetic field is naturally confirmed . for a weak inelasticity parameter @xmath180",
    ", we obtain only one group velocity for both the adiabatic states ( atomic borrmann effect , see part [ part52 ] ) : @xmath181    whereas for @xmath182 , we obtain the two extreme velocities ( defining the borrmann fan ) : @xmath183    but in this case , the beam splitter is inefficient as we will see thereafter .",
    "however , we can show @xcite that these group velocities are closely linked to the average momenta of the considered two level system , and that they are more precisely equal to the most probable momenta of adiabatic states ( divided by @xmath184 ) .    for @xmath185 , two distinct atomic wave packets are created in the beam splitter , and their physical separation may be observable in certain conditions ( more than few @xmath186 after @xmath187 @xmath188 for an initial atomic coherent state of @xmath189 @xmath186 width ) .",
    "finally , it is noteworthy that these group velocities depend on @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , the ( optical ) medium where atoms evolve is dispersive and this effect leads to the phenomenon of anomalous dispersion ( see part [ part64 ] ) .",
    "let us consider the free solution of equation ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "if the internal state of initial atoms is the lower state , we obtain in the initial picture the following lower state : @xmath191    with:@xmath192   s_{aa}\\left (   \\overrightarrow{p}+\\frac{\\hbar \\overrightarrow{k}}{2}\\right)\\ ] ] and the following upper state:@xmath193    with:@xmath194   s_{ba}\\left (   \\overrightarrow{p}+\\frac{\\hbar \\overrightarrow{k}}{2}\\right)\\ ] ]    @xmath195 and @xmath196 having the following usual expressions : @xmath197 -i\\frac{y\\left (   \\overrightarrow{p}\\right )   } { \\sqrt{1+y\\left (   \\overrightarrow { p}\\right )   ^{2}}}\\sin\\left [   \\varepsilon\\left (   \\overrightarrow{p}\\right ) .\\left (   t - t_{0}\\right )   \\right]\\ ] ] @xmath198\\ ] ]    the temporal evolution of the initial state is therefore sinusoidal with an amplitude equal to @xmath199 and a frequency equal to @xmath200 .",
    "tuning the interaction parameters , we can realize true atomic mirrors or @xmath201",
    "pulses  ( transfer of all the atoms from one state to another ) and semi - reflecting plates or @xmath202 pulses  ( 50 - 50 splitting ) , whose efficiency depends in a crucial way of the value of @xmath203 which is actually taken by the central momentum of the incident wave packet .",
    "this effect comes from the fact that the two pre - factors @xmath204 and @xmath205 , in the expression of @xmath195  and @xmath196 , depend on the momentum @xmath190 , and more particularly on its part which is collinear to the laser wave vector @xmath74 ( transverse momentum ) .",
    "therefore , the terms @xmath206 act as momentum filters on the incident atomic momentum distribution .",
    "for example , in the case of the @xmath157 transition , one obtains the well known sinus cardinal filter .",
    "it is characterized by a central lobe with an amplitude of @xmath207   $ ] and a total width of @xmath208 ( for a fixed interaction duration of @xmath209 ) .",
    "this width may be less than the transverse width of the incident atomic momentum distribution .",
    "the resulting ( transverse ) velocity selection is very useful in atom interferometry ( to increase the fringes contrast ) and constitutes the basis of raman cooling @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this central lobe is centered on the transverse momentum @xmath210 : @xmath211    which can be quite different from the initial transverse central momentum @xmath212 . if so , the central momentum @xmath213 of the filtered distribution is distinct from @xmath90 and is bounded by @xmath90 and @xmath214 .",
    "consequently , the central momentum of the outgoing wave packets ( in excited state ) is not @xmath215 , as one would think in view of the mechanical recoil effect of light , but @xmath216 ( see figure [ figveloselect ] ) .",
    "[ h ]    figurepraindia3.ps    apart from the central lobe , the @xmath217 filter has nodes and sidelobes with an amplitude that rapidly decreases ( this particular structure is linked to the pulse shape , and can be softened or removed by the use of apodization functions [ blackman for example ] to tailor laser pulses ) . if the incident atomic distribution is sufficiently broad to encompass one or several sidelobes , the filtered matter wave packet will then be structured into several wave packets whith central momenta quite different from @xmath90 , @xmath214 or @xmath213 .    with respect to the other transition amplitude ( @xmath154 , i.e. without change of internal state )",
    ", we obtain the complement filter and the structuring can be studied in the same way @xcite .",
    "this effect refers to the modification of spreading of atomic wave packets inside a beam splitter .",
    "it is more convenient to examine it for an incident atomic wave packet which has a thin momentum distribution , although it can be studied and modeled for any momentum distribution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as we consider the wave packets which evolve inside the beam splitter , we have to go into the adiabatic states . in the adiabatic picture , these wave packets have the two energies ( written here for the @xmath157 transition ) : @xmath218    where the term @xmath219 can be taylor expanded with respect to @xmath220 as : @xmath221    where @xmath222 is defined as : @xmath223    and where @xmath224 is the complement matrix of the recoil term @xmath225 : @xmath226{ccc}k_{x}^{2 } & k_{x}k_{y } & k_{x}k_{z}\\\\ k_{x}k_{y } & k_{y}^{2 } & k_{y}k_{z}\\\\ k_{x}k_{z } & k_{y}k_{z } & k_{z}^{2}\\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ]    in the initial picture , the first order term of this expansion gives the group velocities obtained in part [ part61 ] . as for the second order term , it corresponds to an additional dispersion and it indicates that one wave packet spreads more than the natural spreading , and that the other one spreads less . in certain conditions ,",
    "this spreading can even be stopped or changed into a contraction @xcite .    in the case of a non - thin incident",
    "atomic wave packet , the main results of this study are still valid provided @xmath222 is changed into @xmath227 .",
    "one can then model the outgoing atomic wave packets .",
    "a simple but powerful way to do this is the gaussian modeling which consists in writing these wave packets as gaussians .",
    "this `` strong field ttt modeling '' , and more generally the use of gaussian wave packets , is found to be particularly relevant in atom interferometry ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have already seen in part [ part4 ] how to deal with the double non - commutation problem which appears in @xmath66 and in the resolution of ( [ eq3 ] ) . in particular , we have seen that one can often neglect , in the expression of @xmath66 , the terms depending on the quadratic terms of @xmath12 , namely @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 . in certain configurations ( when @xmath74 is orthogonal to @xmath231 or when @xmath73 is modulated to compensate the gravity induced doppler shift ) , the generalized detuning is even equal to the free one and it boils down to the free case in ( and only in ) the resolution of ( [ eq3 ] ) .    in this case , we obtain the same previous adiabatic energies and consequently the same adiabatic group velocities , rabi oscillations , velocity selection and anomalous dispersion effect as stated before . in the initial picture ( i.e. in the lab frame ) , the elements of the previous s@xmath145 matrix are therefore expressed as ( @xmath232 ) : @xmath233   .\\exp\\left [   \\frac { i}{\\hbar}\\overrightarrow{r_{op}}.\\overrightarrow{p_{uv}}\\right ]   .\\exp\\left [ -\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\overrightarrow{p_{op}}.\\overrightarrow{r_{uv}}\\right ] .s_{uv}\\left (   \\overrightarrow{p_{op}}\\mp\\frac{\\hbar\\overrightarrow{k}}{2}\\right)\\ ] ]    where the elements @xmath206 are equal to the ones obtained in the free case ( see the previous part ) .    finally , the only differences from the free case lie in the expression of :    1 .   the effective incident wave packet at time @xmath31 ( which is equal to the initial wave packet evolved from @xmath109 to @xmath31 thanks to @xmath144 ) . in particular , its central position and momentum are",

    "moreover , we have already underlined that the key parameter is the inelasticity parameter @xmath240 which is proportional to the generalized detuning @xmath241 .",
    "this @xmath240 parameter generally depends on the two canonical operators @xmath20 and @xmath37 , but in the case of linear potentials ( uniform acceleration for example ) it depends on one operator ( @xmath37 ) only .    before dealing with the general case ,",
    "let us consider the effect of a uniform ( but time - dependent ) acceleration @xmath10 . from the equation ( [ eq3 ] ) , which becomes scalar in momentum representation",

    "let us remark that the acceleration induced doppler term @xmath249 may produce a non - trivial bending of central atomic trajectories .",
    "indeed , if @xmath246 and the scalar @xmath250 are non zero , and if @xmath246 has the same sign as @xmath251 , then the trajectories bending due to the @xmath251 term makes these trajectories get closer ( as usually considered in literature ) . on the contrary , if @xmath246 has the opposite sign of @xmath251 , then these two main trajectories repel each other ( see figure [ figkg ] ) . in both cases , if the vectors @xmath74 and @xmath231 point at the same direction ( @xmath252 ) , downward for example , then one of the two main atomic wave packets will always be accelerated upward , even if all forces  ( acceleration and laser pulse ) seem to push the atoms downward .    [ h ]    figurepraindia4.ps    furthermore , this particular behavior is not limited to the adiabatic picture and can be observed fully in the laboratory frame ( i.e. in the initial picture ) . indeed , if @xmath253 ( which corresponds , for @xmath254 , to the bragg regime , as it is defined in @xcite  in contrast with the channeling regime  for which @xmath255 ) , this anomalous upward acceleration exceeds the downward acceleration of gravity ( for @xmath256 much less than @xmath257 ) . as a result",
    ", some atoms are accelerated upward in the lab frame , even if the action of @xmath231  and laser beams is directed downward ( see figure [ figantigrav ] ) .",
    "of course , this anomalous anti - gravitational  bending can be explained simply by considering the conservation of momentum and energy during the interaction process .",
    "[ h ]    figurepraindia5.ps    in the general case of an at - most - quadratic @xmath12 ( with quadratic terms like rotations , gradients of acceleration , trapping potentials , etc ) , the generalized detuning @xmath66 depends on the two non - commuting canonical operators , and it can not be made scalar in any representation . as we saw previously ,",
    "one of the most relevant strategies is to approximate , in the resolution of equation ( [ eq3 ] ) , the effect of one of these two operators by considering its action on a typical atomic wave packet which evolves inside the beam splitter . in the free case , the gaussian approximation of these typical wave packets , called here wp  for convenience , leads to ( in the adiabatic picture ) : @xmath258    where @xmath259 is linked to the complex momentum width of the initial atomic wave packet , and where @xmath260 accounts for the anomalous dispersion phenomenon .",
    "in fact , we can make @xmath260 arbitrarily small ( for a sufficiently small interaction duration ) and incorporate the time - independent matrix @xmath259 into the expression of @xmath240  ( see ( [ eqdeltaop ] ) and ( [ eqy+ ] ) ) , and consider only the two first terms of ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "finally , the quantity @xmath261 meets the following first order differential equation ( which can be solved numerically ) : @xmath262    with : @xmath263    a simpler approximation ( wkb approximation ) amounts to neglecting also @xmath264 in the expression ( [ eq7 ] ) . in this case",
    ", we obtain readily : @xmath265    which gives a good approximation of the group velocities inside a matter wave beam splitter when this latter is subject to the various external potentials described by @xmath12 .",
    "for example , for a non - uniform ( but time - independent ) acceleration @xmath266 ( or in the case of a trapping potential , for which the sign of @xmath230 has to be reversed ) , one obtains : @xmath267    similarly , in the case of a ( time - independent ) rotation @xmath268 , one obtains : @xmath269   \\right ) /2\\omega_{0}\\overline{f}\\left (   t\\right)\\ ] ] where the rotation matrix @xmath270 can be seen as acting either on the atomic wave packet or on the wave vector @xmath271 .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown in this paper how to solve the problem of matter wave splitting in the presence of various gravitational , inertial and trapping potentials . in particular , we have seen how the resonance condition between the splitting potential and the effective two - level atoms has to be changed .",
    "then , we have shown how to express this triple interaction matter - splitting potential - other external potentials  as an equivalent instantaneous interaction ( generalized @xmath0 scheme ) .",
    "finally , we have investigated in detail what is the dispersive structuring of an incident atomic wave packet inside such beam splitters , both in the free case ( for which @xmath12  is reduced to @xmath132 ) and in the general case of @xmath12 .",
    "several significant features of the solutions have been studied : group velocities , generalized rabi oscillations , velocity selection , anomalous dispersion effects ... in the light of this study , the generalized @xmath0 scheme leads to a very practical and efficient ( gaussian ) modeling of atomic beam splitters which is particularly relevant for atom interferometric signal calculations @xcite .",
    "however , several points still have to be cleared up : for instance , the problem of the effective mass change which occurs when the atomic internal state is changed , and which leads to non - trivial ( small ) relativistic corrections .",
    "furthermore , it is necessary to extend our formalism to additional external potentials which are more than quadratic ( in position and momentum ) if we want to investigate the effect of van - der - waals , casimir or yukawa - type potentials on the matter wave splitting .",

    "<S> we present a strong field theory of matter wave splitting in the presence of various gravitational , inertial and trapping potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of these potentials on the resonance condition ( between the splitting potential and the considered effective two - level system ) and on the atomic borrmann effect is investigated in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersive structuring of an incident atomic wave packet - due to such generalized beam splitters - is studied and modeled , and several important dynamical features of the solutions are detailed ( generalized rabi oscillations , velocity selection , anomalous dispersion , generalized borrmann effect and anomalous gravitational bending ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show how to express this triple interaction matter - splitting potential - gravito - inertial and trapping potentials  as an equivalent instantaneous interaction which turns out to be a very efficient tool for the modeling of atom interferometers .    </S>",
