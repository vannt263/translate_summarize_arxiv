    "most current cosmological models rely on the assumption that the dynamics of the universe is described by einstein s general relativity ( gr ) and a material content that is dominated by two so far unknown components , pressureless dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) , a substance equipped with a large negative pressure . for reviews of the actual situation see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the preferred model is the @xmath7cdm model which also plays the role of a reference model for alternative approaches to the de problem .",
    "while the @xmath7cdm model can describe most of the observations , there still remain puzzles @xcite .",
    "other attempts to describe the apparently observed accelerated expansion of the universe ( see , however , @xcite ) are a potential back - reaction mechanism from non - linear structure formation @xcite or models of the lematre - tolman - bondi type which are isotropic but not homogeneous @xcite .",
    "then there exists a line of investigation that modifies gr with the aim to obtain an accelerated expansion of the universe as a result of the ( modified ) geometrical sector instead of matter with a negative pressure @xcite .",
    "here we focus on a class of approaches within gr that do not separate dm and de from the start but regard the dark sector as a one - component substratum which exhibits properties of both de and dm on a joint footing",
    ". the best known models of this kind are chaplygin - gas type cosmologies . starting with @xcite , there has been a considerable activity in this field @xcite . among the host of models proposed over the years for the dark sector , the unified models are minimal in the sense that they assume just one component that describes both dark matter and dark energy .",
    "both components manifest themselves observationally only through their gravitational action .",
    "therefore , a unified description is certainly attractive , at least as long there is no direct , i.e. , other than gravitational , detection of either or even both of the dark components . while the chaplygin - gas models could well describe the snia results @xcite , i.e. , the cosmic background dynamics",
    ", they seem to have fallen out of favor because of apparent problems to reproduce the matter power spectrum .",
    "the difficulties of the generalized chaplygin - gas cosmologies are related to the values of the sound speed of these models .",
    "depending on the @xmath8-parameter , the sound speed is either finite , i.e. , it becomes of the order of the speed of light , or its square is negative . in the first case ,",
    "the small - scale perturbation behavior is oscillatory , in the second case there appear instabilities . in neither of these cases , the observed matter power spectrum is reproduced .",
    "this circumstance has led the authors of @xcite to the conclusion that chaplygin - gas models of the cosmic medium are ruled out as competitive candidates .",
    "similar results were obtained from the analysis of the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background @xcite , except possibly for low values of the hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "however , these conclusions rely on the assumption of an adiabatic cosmic medium .",
    "it has been argued that there might exist entropy perturbations , so far not taken into account , which may change the result of the adiabatic perturbation analysis @xcite .",
    "a problem here is the origin of non - adiabatic perturbations which should reflect the internal structure of the cosmic medium .",
    "the latter is unknown but it may well be more complicated then suggested by the usually applied simple ( adiabatic ) equations of state .",
    "non - adiabatic perturbations will modify the adiabatic sound speed .",
    "the speed of sound has generally attracted interest as a tool to discriminate between different dark energy models @xcite .",
    " silent \" chaplygin gases were postulated by introducing ad hoc a non - adiabatic counter - term to exactly compensate the adiabatic pressure contribution @xcite .",
    "another option for a unified description of the dark sector are viscous models . from early universe cosmology",
    "it is known that a bulk viscosity of the cosmic medium can induce an inflationary phase @xcite .",
    "a bulk viscous pressure in the early universe can be the result of cosmological particle production @xcite . under the conditions of spatial homogeneity and isotropy ,",
    "a scalar bulk viscous pressure is the only admissible non - equilibrium phenomenon .",
    "the cosmological relevance of bulk viscous media has subsequently been investigated in some detail for an inflationary phase in the early universe ( see @xcite and references therein ) . with accumulating evidence for our present universe to be in a stage of accelerated expansion ,",
    "an effective bulk viscous pressure was discussed as one of the potential sources for this phenomenon as well .",
    "it was argued in @xcite , that such a pressure can play the role of an agent that drives the present acceleration of the universe .",
    "the option of a viscosity - dominated late epoch of the universe with accelerated expansion was already mentioned in @xcite , long before the direct observational evidence through the sn ia data . for a homogeneous and isotropic universe",
    ", the @xmath7cdm model and the ( generalized ) chaplygin - gas models can be reproduced as special cases of this imperfect fluid description @xcite .",
    "the possibility of using cosmological observations to probe and constrain imperfect dark - energy fluids was investigated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the bulk viscosity contributes with a negative term to the total pressure and hence a dissipative fluid seems to be a potential dark energy candidate ( for a recent preprint see @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is expedient to repeat a cautionary remark . in traditional non - equilibrium thermodynamics",
    "the viscous pressure represents a ( small ) correction to the ( positive ) equilibrium pressure .",
    "this is true both for the eckart @xcite and for the israel - stewart theories @xcite .",
    "here we shall admit the viscous pressure to be the dominating part of the pressure .",
    "this is clearly beyond the established range of validity of conventional non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "non - standard interactions are required to support such type of approach @xcite .",
    "of course , this reflects the circumstance that dark energy is anything but a  standard \" fluid .",
    "there are suggestions that viscosity might have its origin in string landscape @xcite . to successfully describe the transition to a phase of accelerated expansion , preceded by a phase of decelerated expansion in which structures can form , it is necessary that the viscous pressure is negligible at high redshifts but becomes dominant later on .    extending previous work ( @xcite ) ,",
    "this paper provides a detailed study of perturbations in a viscous fluid model of the dark sector which in the homogeneous and isotropic background coincides with the dynamics of a generalized chaplygin gas .",
    "the differences in the perturbation dynamics of both approaches are traced back to an inherent non - adiabatic behavior of the viscous model . in a sense ,",
    "the viscous dark - fluid model can be seen as a non - adiabatic chaplygin gas .",
    "it does not suffer from the shortcomings of the so far considered adiabatic chaplygin - gas models , i.e. , it predicts neither ( unobserved ) oscillations nor instabilities .",
    "moreover , the non - adiabatic behavior is part of the model and no ad hoc introduced counter terms to the adiabatic sound speed are required .",
    "the resulting power spectrum fits both the 2dfgrs as well as the sdss data and , for certain parameter combinations , the @xmath6-value of the viscous model is better than the corresponding @xmath7cdm - value .",
    "as in @xcite , we shall describe the bulk viscous pressure by eckart s expression @xcite @xmath9 ( latin indices run from 0 to 3 ) , where the ( non - negative ) quantity @xmath10 is the ( generally not constant ) bulk - viscosity coefficient and @xmath11 is the fluid - expansion scalar which in the homogeneous and isotropic background reduces to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the hubble parameter and @xmath14 is the scale factor of the robertson - walker metric . by this assumption",
    "we ignore all the problems inherent in eckart s approach which have been discussed and resolved within the israel - stewart theory @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we expect that for the applications we have in mind here , the differences are of minor importance .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ basic dynamics ] introduces the basic dynamics of bulk viscous cosmology and describes the homogeneous and isotropic background solutions in analogy to their well - known ( generalized ) chaplygin - gas counterparts .",
    "section [ perturbations ] contains the general non - adiabatic perturbation dynamics . in order to point out the differences between the viscous and the chaplygin - gas models , the dynamics",
    "is developed in parallel for both approaches . in section [ numerical results ]",
    "it is shown that the basic second - order equations only coincide deep in the matter - dominated era .",
    "subsequently , the numerical solutions and the corresponding matter power spectra are presented and compared with the 2dfgrs and the sdss data .",
    "a summary of our study is given in section [ summary ] .",

    "<S> we model the dark sector of the cosmic substratum by a viscous fluid with an equation of state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the fluid - expansion scalar and @xmath2 is the coefficient of bulk viscosity for which we assume a dependence @xmath3 on the energy density @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the homogeneous and isotropic background dynamics coincides with that of a generalized chaplygin gas with equation of state @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation dynamics of the viscous model , however , is intrinsically non - adiabatic and qualitatively different from the chaplygin - gas case . in particular , it avoids short - scale instabilities and/or oscillations which apparently have ruled out unified models of the chaplygin - gas type . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the matter power spectrum and demonstrate that the non - adiabatic model is compatible with the data from the 2dfgrs and the sdss surveys . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath6-analysis shows , that for certain parameter combinations the viscous - dark - fluid ( vdf ) model is well competitive with the @xmath7cdm model . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that _ non - adiabatic _ unified models can be seen as potential contenders for a general - relativity - based description of the cosmic substratum . </S>"
