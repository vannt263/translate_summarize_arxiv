    "an elementary similarity between ray and wave theories of light is the law of specular reflection : ` the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection ' .",
    "this rule , while valid for plane waves , is now understood to be only approximately true for light beams ( and , in general , any wave beam ) which has finite transverse extent . as originally discovered by goos and hnchen @xcite , under total internal reflection",
    ", the centre of a reflected light beam is slightly shifted spatially with respect to the centre of the incident beam in the plane of incidence .",
    "furthermore , if the incident polarization is neither purely in the plane of incidence nor purely orthogonal to it , the shift has a transverse component too ( imbert - federov shift ) @xcite , which may be interpreted as the spin - orbit coupling of light @xcite . if the reflection is not total , although still dielectric , the reflected beam acquires an angular shift , deflecting the centre slightly upon propagation , which can be both longitudinal and transverse @xcite . in a closely related effect ,",
    "different polarizations are reflected slightly differently ; for incident linear polarization , different circular components are shifted to opposite sides of the incident plane , although the total beam centre is not transversally shifted , resulting in the ` spin hall effect of light ' @xcite .",
    "the separation of spin components of a beam is , however , not restricted to the transverse direction , and has also been observed within the plane of incidence @xcite .",
    "basic to all these phenomena is that the magnitude of the shift with respect to a suitable chosen measure is independent of the beam s angular spectrum , provided it is axisymmetric and tightly concentrated about a mean incidence angle .",
    "unsurprisingly , all of these different shifts are intimately related : angular and spatial , in partial and total reflection , affecting the entire beam and separate polarization components .",
    "our purpose here is to present a straightforward unified framework for their description and analysis .",
    "we derive a simple formula for the shift of any polarization component of the reflected beam , and show that the overall centroid of the reflected intensity pattern is a suitably weighted sum of the shifts of orthogonal polarizations of the final beam .",
    "this form is naturally expressed as a complex vector , and writing it in this way reveals a close relationship with the quantum - mechanical notion of weak values and weak measurements of operators @xcite . in this approach , the effect of an operator on an initial state is not considered overlapped with the same initial state , as with a regular quantum expectation value , but rather with a particular , postselected state which is different from but not orthogonal to the initial state ( and neither the initial nor the final state is an eigenstate of the operator ) . this has been previously discussed and experimentally measured for the ` spin hall effect of light ' @xcite , where a weak measurement was used to show that beam components undergo shifts that the overall intensity centroid does not experience .    in our case",
    ", the initial state preparation corresponds to a uniform initial polarization @xmath0 a postselecting measurement state from a polarization analyzer @xmath1 ( in general unrelated to @xmath2 ) , and the operator in question is the reflection matrix , which acts on different plane wave components of the beam differently , since the angle and plane of incidence depend on the direction of the plane wave component . for a narrow paraxial beam ,",
    "this dependence is so small that the polarization couples only weakly to space , so the spatial beam shift is analogous to shift of the pointer .",
    "the weak value of an operator is in general complex , and it has been proved that the imaginary part corresponds to a shift in the conjugate variable @xcite .",
    "if the pointer corresponds to the real space representation of the beam , then its conjugate variable is the fourier space : the imaginary part of the weak value is the angular shift . the full extent of the connection between weak values and beam shifts extents even further and deserves its own exposition in a more general framework , which we present in a companion paper @xcite .    here , we consider explicitly the resulting shifts with input and analyzer polarizers ( @xmath2 and @xmath1 ) chosen from three natural bases : the transverse electric ( te ) and magnetic ( tm ) ( ` @xmath3 ' ) , circular ( ` @xmath4 ' ) and @xmath5 and @xmath6 linear ( ` @xmath7 ' ) bases , and we find a symmetry in the shifts between input and output polarizations common to total and partial reflection .",
    "surprisingly for a phenomenon which can be used for optical biosensing and nano - probing @xcite we also find shifts of polarization components that are material independent .",
    "furthermore , our unified formula shows that , when measured in the appropriate units , the formula for the angular shift is independent of the shape of the spectrum of the incident beam . our approach is self - contained , and our derivation clarifies aspects of previous descriptions of beam shifts .",
    "the physics of beam shifts depends wholly on the fresnel reflection coefficients @xmath8 which are the scalar weightings an electromagnetic plane wave acquires on reflection from a planar reflection surface .",
    "we assume throughout that the reflection is dielectric ( i.e.  unit relative magnetic permeability @xmath9 and real relative permittivity @xmath10 ) , and an angle of incidence @xmath11 in general , there are two eigenpolarizations for plane wave reflection , ` @xmath12 ' corresponding to ( electric ) polarization perpendicular to the plane of incidence , and ` @xmath13 ' for ( electric ) polarization in the incidence plane , with two different fresnel coefficients",
    "@xcite : @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the relative refractive index ( the refractive index of the medium in which the light propagates is in the denominator ) ; that is @xmath16 for reflection by a denser medium .",
    "the reflection coefficients are each given in two forms , each useful depending on whether @xmath17 the first assumes that @xmath18 appropriate for total internal reflection ( where @xmath19 is greater than the critical angle @xmath20 ) , in which case the reflection coefficient is complex and unimodular , @xmath21 in the other case , partial reflection ( which also has some transmission , which not considered here ) , @xmath22 so @xmath23 is real .",
    "although the formulare similar , @xmath24 at the brewster angle @xmath25 whereas @xmath26 for dielectric reflection",
    ".    the spatial and angular goos - hnchen ( gh ) shift within the plane of incidence can be intuitively understood from a two - dimensional picture in which @xmath12 and @xmath13 polarization can be treated separately .",
    "any two - dimensional wave packet or beam consists of a spectrum of plane waves with different incidence angles , so each acquires a different reflection coefficient ( for each @xmath12 and @xmath13 component of the polarization ) . when the beam is tightly concentrated around a common incidence angle @xmath27 all beam shifts are a first - order effect in the spectral width of the beam , and their nature ( spatial or angular ) depends on how the polarization - weighted sum of @xmath28 and @xmath29 varies over the spectrum : a variation of the imaginary part alone leads to a spatial shift , and real variation , to an angular shift ( see below , fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] ) .",
    "because both spatial and angular goos - hnchen shifts are usually small when compared to a generic measure , they can be seen as corrections to the laws of geometrical optics @xcite .",

    "a ) the angular spectrum of the incident light beam ( green ) is schematically shown as colour gradient .",
    "the virtual reflected beam ( red ) is formed by the geometric reflection with respect to the interface ( @xmath30-axis ) of each plane wave in the spectrum .",
    "b ) for a unimodular reflection coefficient ( [ eq : rs ] ) , ( [ eq : rp ] ) the physically reflected beam appears shifted by distance @xmath31 parallel to the propagation axis of the virtual reflected beam .",
    "c ) for a real reflection coefficient the physically reflected beam is deflected by an angle @xmath32 due to the modulation of the amplitude for each plane wave in the spectrum upon reflection . ]    to understand the imbert - federov ( if ) shift , which is transverse to the incidence plane , it is necessary to use a vectorial , three - dimensional picture , and it is crucial to distinguish between the global direction of the beam s electrical field and the polarization of the individual plane waves in the angular spectrum . owing to transversality , the electrical field for each plane wave in the spectrum has a different direction , and therefore different @xmath12 and @xmath13 polarization components with respect to their local plane of incidence .",
    "this is the origin for the ` spin - orbit coupling of light ' @xcite and is responsible for spatial and angular imbert - fedorov shifts @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the in - plane shifts , these transverse shifts do not depend on the change of the reflection coefficient with the angle of incidence , but rather on the difference between the reflection coefficients for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 components .    in our calculation",
    ", both effects appear in a unified framework by virtue of a general scattering or reflection dyadic @xmath33 , which projects the electric field of each plane wave component into its local @xmath12 and @xmath13 direction , and applies the appropriate fresnel coefficient to the reflected wave .",
    "the main formul for the total beam and component shifts are given together in section [ sec : formulae ] , and are interpreted in terms of weak values of the beam .",
    "these expressions are derived in section [ sec:3dvector ] .",
    "we compare the total and component shifts for three naturally incompatible bases of polarizations for the incident and reflected beam in section [ sec : tox ] : the @xmath3 basis given by the transverse electric and magnetic polarizations ( i.e.  the eigenpolarizations of a plane wave on the beam axis ) , the @xmath4 basis of circular polarizations , and the @xmath7 basis of linear polarizations diagonal to the @xmath3 basis .",
    "this choice of three bases ( represented by three orthogonal directions on the poincar sphere @xcite ) is clearly special , since each polarization is made up of equal weightings of each vector in the other two bases : for each one of these polarization states , a polarization measurement in a different basis can not discriminate between this vector and its orthogonal partner .",
    "there are additional symmetries that occur between different polarizations , some of which are specific to whether the reflection is total or partial .",
    "for ease of reference , we present the main formul  for all of the various shifts , including the well - known total beam shift , and the newly derived scalar component shift . a self - contained calculation for all of them",
    "is given in section [ sec:3dvector ] .",
    "we think of two different setups , which lead to two different types of shift : the first is the ` centre of mass ' shift of the entire vector beam , that is without specifying a polarization analyser for the reflected beam .",
    "the second is the shift of a polarized scalar component of the beam , as filtered out from the non - uniformly polarized reflected beam by use of an analyser .",
    "the fact that different polarization components undergo different shifts has been called the ` spin hall effect of light ' @xcite when these shifts are transverse , although as we will describe for the general case , both longitudinal and transverse relative shifts between different polarization components are typical .",
    "the total centre of mass shift is , in fact , an average between every pair of orthogonal polarization components , weighted by the intensity of that component ( as we will show explicitly later ) .",
    "we use the coordinates of the reflected beam ( as below , fig .",
    "[ fig : vectorcone ] ) , with @xmath30- , @xmath34- and @xmath35- directions corresponding to the axial tm ( @xmath13-direction of the axis ) , te ( axial @xmath12-direction ) , and propagation directions respectively .",
    "( we use te and tm to avoid confusion with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which are defined differently for each plane wave component . ) the polarization of the incident beam in the tm - te plane is written @xmath2 and an output polarization component is determined by the analyzer polarization @xmath1 which in general are complex for elliptic polarization , and given in terms of te , tm components , @xmath36    our formul  will be written as a complex dimensionless vector @xmath37 whose corresponding spatial shift @xmath38 and angular shift @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the second moment of the spectrum in fourier space , and @xmath42 is the optical wavenumber .",
    "the @xmath30-component of these two real vectors , in the tm direction of the beam , is therefore the longitudinal gh shift , and the second , @xmath34- , component is the transverse if shift .",
    "the shift formuldepend on the beam axis incidence angle @xmath27 the mean reflection coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 evaluated at this angle , and their derivatives @xmath45 @xmath46 with respect to @xmath19 at @xmath47 the overall beam shift depends on the incident polarization @xmath48 and the shift of a single polarization component depends on @xmath2 and @xmath49    the expressions for the shifts can be written more compactly with the definition of vectorial quantities relevant to reflection .",
    "the ` mean reflection matrix ' in the tm - te basis is @xmath50 and the first - order term in the small incidence angle expansion of the full matrix depends on two matrices , @xmath51 the diagonal @xmath52 is responsible for the longitudinal shift , whereas the off - diagonal @xmath53 determines the transverse shift .",
    "the shift to the total beam @xmath54 is simply @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the conjugate transpose of the mean reflection matrix @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the complex conjugate of the polarization vector @xmath2 . in the derivation of this expression in section [ sec:3dvector ]",
    "we write @xmath54 slightly differently , but the expression above is equivalent to ( [ eq : meanorthref ] ) using the convention of the 2-component shift vector in which the first and second components refer respectively to the shifts in the longitudinal and transverse direction .    the shift for a polarization component @xmath59",
    "is given by a similar expression , but now depending on the output polarization @xmath60 @xmath61 both shift expressions could be further simplified by writing a 2-vector of @xmath62 matrices @xmath63 but we will keep the separation explicit in the following .",
    "the form of equation ( [ eq : compweak ] ) is very similar to that of a the ` weak value ' of a quantum - mechanical operator @xmath64 with initial state @xmath65 and final state @xmath66 .",
    "the usual definition of the weak value of @xmath64 is @xcite : @xmath67 the significance of this quantity is that it represents the outcome of the operation @xmath68 postselected into a new state @xmath66 rather than compared with the initial state @xmath69 the weak value is of course only defined when @xmath66 is not orthogonal to @xmath65 ( otherwise the denominator would blow up the whole expression ) , but can take on arbitrarily large values when @xmath66 and @xmath65 are almost orthogonal , as the overlap in the numerator is not necessarily particularly small , although the denominator can approach zero arbitrarily . hence weak values can be arbitrarily large even when the spectrum of @xmath64 is bounded , and as such are sometimes called ` superweak ' @xcite .",
    "it is crucial that the interaction of the initial state with the rest of the system is weak , so the final system @xmath70 is largely undisturbed by the action of @xmath71 this weak interaction should involve changing the state of a different , pointer state whose motion indicates the weak value , given by @xmath72 we will discuss this connection briefly below ; more details of the connection are given in the companion paper to this one , @xcite .",
    "we consider a well collimated beam with a narrow axisymmetric spectrum @xmath73 which is parametrized by a single angle @xmath74 , which denotes the angle of every plane wave in the spectrum with the central wave vector or the beam axis ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vectorcone ] ) .",
    "this beam is in an initial state , namely a wavepacket with a homogeneous initial polarization @xmath0 represented by a single point in polarization space ( the poincar sphere @xcite ) .",
    "after reflection , the beam is strongly localized in polarization space , but is no longer a single point ( and , when @xmath2 is not an eigenpolarization , the state out is not the state in ) . since the initial beam was concentrated in a particular initial direction ,",
    "the spread of polarization in the reflected beam is small , but postselecting by a particular component @xmath1 can reveal a larger effect than is present in the overall beam ( the total shift ) .",
    "furthermore , since the spread in fourier space is narrow , the beam width is large , much larger than the small ( wavelength - scale ) shift in the beam s centre .",
    "the configuration space position of the beam thus corresponds to the measurement system , interacting weakly ( due to the narrow beam ) on reflection with the polarization degrees of freedom : @xmath75 corresponds to @xmath72    the imaginary part of the weak value ( [ eq : weak ] ) is related to a shift in the canonically conjugate variable corresponding to the pointer , i.e.  the direction of the beam ( position in fourier space ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is proved that , under a quantum weak interaction , the weak shift in direction should be proportional to @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the variance of the wavenumber @xmath42 , which  in our case of an axisymmetric spectrum  is given by @xmath41 , the second moment of the spectrum in the fourier space .",
    "the case of the coupling of direction and polarization in beam reflection is similar to von neumann measurement : interaction is instantaneous in propagation distance ( i.e.  time ) , and the weak interaction hamiltonian ( the reflection operator ) depends linearly on direction @xmath78 indeed , not only is the angular shift proportional to the imaginary part of @xmath79 but the proportionality factor is precisely the variance of the spectral distribution in fourier space .    in their experimental verification of the spin hall effect of light , hosten and",
    "kwiat @xcite interpreted the very large spatial shift on transmission of an almost vertical analyzer state with a horizontal initial state , on transmission through a dielectric object ( we make the reasonable assumption that there are similar transmission counterparts to our equations in section [ sec : formulae ] ) .",
    "in particular , the sign of the shift was seen to depend on the sign of the small perturbation angle from vertical , and of course the shift was not defined when the analyzer was truly vertical .    of course , the denominators of ( [ eq : compweak ] ) and ( [ eq : weak ] ) differ , which in the beam shift case depends on the mean reflection matrix @xmath80 which is ( possibly complex ) diagonal in the tm - te basis .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that , unless the initial beam is polarized in the te or tm direction , the disturbance to the polarization on reflection is not small , and is given by @xmath81 the shift is therefore weak with respect to the system ( without interaction ) evolving into @xmath82 corresponding to the polarization of the on - axis plane wave polarization after reflection @xmath83 with this replacement , we can see that the beam shift truly corresponds to the weak value of the operator we call the ` artmann operator ' @xmath84 preselected by the result of the noninteracting evolution operator @xmath85 acting on @xmath86 and postselected by @xmath87 note that the notation here differs slightly from @xcite .",
    "superweak values are therefore guaranteed when the postselection analyzer @xmath1 is almost orthogonal to @xmath88 rather than almost orthogonal to @xmath2 itself . for the choice in @xcite",
    ", @xmath89 is an eigenstate of @xmath80 so in this case only should @xmath1 be almost perpendicular to @xmath90    a different , arbitrarily large shift is possible , distinct from the aforementioned ` superweak shift ' : the mean reflection matrix @xmath57 itself may be close to singular , which occurs when @xmath91 is close to the brewster angle ( at which @xmath92 ) . to take advantage of this large shift , either the analyzer or the numerator should be wholly longitudinal , say the analyzer @xmath49 in this case , @xmath93 which is arbitrarily small regardless of the initial polarization . of course , this discussion is only valid in the first order in @xmath74 approximation we have developed , and more sophisticated mathematics has been employed to describe reflection at brewster incidence @xcite .",
    "therefore , given the presence of the mean reflection operator in the denominator of ( [ eq : compweak ] ) , there should be a finite but nonzero shift between any pair of orthogonal polarizations .",
    "after the derivation of the shift formul , given in the next section , we will discuss the spatial and angular shifts that occur between states in the @xmath94 @xmath4 and @xmath7 bases , for both total and partial reflection .",
    "however , first we give a derivation of the beam shift formul .",
    "readers uninterested in these derivations , but are interested in their consequences , may skip to section [ sec : tox ] .",
    "our approach to the calculation of the shift formulgiven in the previous section is based on the introduction of a ` virtual reflected beam ' , which is in reflected beam coordinates , constructed by ` mirroring ' every plane in the angular spectrum as in geometrical optics without taking the reflection coefficient into account . effectively , the virtual beam is the reflection of the incident beam with @xmath95 for all directions , but otherwise the virtual beam incorporates the direction change of each plane wave component on reflection .",
    "it is therefore the virtual beam which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] ( a ) .",
    "the real reflected beam follows from applying the reflection coefficients ( [ eq : rs ] ) , ( [ eq : rp ] ) to each plane wave component of the virtual beam separately .",
    "we find the virtual beam a useful conceptual object in considering beam shifts , particularly the angular shift .",
    "the origin of the angular shift comes from the fact that different plane wave components acquire different amplitude weightings , as the real reflection coefficient depends on angle . in fourier space ,",
    "the shift comes from a real gradient applied to the spectrum , as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d](c ) , rather than a translation of the overall direction ( which would be closer to the spatial shift ) .",
    "the virtual beam is the same , independent of the physics of the different physical regimes considered ( spatial or angular , total or partial reflection ) .",
    "we note that the virtual beam utilized here is slightly different from the one we describe in @xcite  there , the virtual beam has a different overall polarization from that considered here .",
    "we therefore work in beam coordinates defined above , with @xmath30 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 the tm , te and propagation directions . in coordinates based on the dielectric interface ( implicit in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] ) , the reflection angle of the beam is @xmath27 which therefore corresponds to the @xmath35-direction . in spherical polar coordinates based around the propagation direction , we define an azimuth angle @xmath96 and colatitude @xmath97 which is zero on the beam axis . each plane wave making up the beam has a wavevector of magnitude @xmath98 and is parametrized by @xmath96 and @xmath97 @xmath99 the spectrum , giving the real amplitude weighting of the plane waves , is denoted @xmath100 which is concentrated around @xmath101 that is , the vector @xmath102 along the propagation axis .",
    "we also assume that the spectrum is independent of @xmath96 ( i.e.  axisymmetric ) , and is square - integrable , but apart from this ( and the concentration around @xmath103 ) , the spectrum is otherwise completely general . by transversality ,",
    "the initial polarization of the axial @xmath104 component beam must be perpendicular , with components @xmath105 in the tm , te directions ( and given by the 2-vector @xmath2 in this plane ) . since the incident beam has a constant overall polarization given by the constants @xmath106 the polarization of each plane wave component must have these components in the tm , te direction",
    ".    the polarization of the incident beam , and hence the virtual beam , is uniform polarized .",
    "however , since the plane of incidence varies around the beam azimuth @xmath107 the precise resolution into each plane wave s particular @xmath12 and @xmath13 direction varies around the beam ( ) .",
    "a direct consequence of this variation is that the reflected beam will no longer be uniformly polarized , which is why choosing different settings for the polarization analyzer @xmath1 can lead to very different beam shifts .",
    "the shifts themselves only depend on terms to first order in @xmath74 in the reflection coefficient and local incidence direction ; higher - order terms have a smaller effect which we ignore .",
    "schematic explanation of the beam coordinate system @xmath108 and @xmath35 , where @xmath35 points along the propagation direction of the beam , @xmath30 lies in the global plane of incidence and @xmath34 is transverse to both @xmath30 and @xmath35 .",
    "a ) shows the cone geometry used to parametrize the angular spectrum by @xmath74 and @xmath96 and illustrates that the local angle of incidence @xmath19 varies around the angular spectrum .",

    "so this extra spin - orbit effect plays no significant role in the transverse shifts , though it affects the axial polarization @xcite .",
    "the whole analysis can therefore be restricted to the two transverse dimensions alone .",

    "we are not concerned with the upper limit in the @xmath74 integral , as it is cut off by the narrow spectrum @xmath114    in beam coordinates , the reflection plane is now oblique , as depicted for a cone of wavevectors with constant @xmath74 in fig .  [",
    "fig : vectorcone ] .",
    "the intersection of the @xmath42-space cone and the plane is thus a conic section , and the precise angle of incidence of each vector on the cone varies with @xmath115 if the reflection angle of the beam axis is @xmath27 the normal vector to the reflection plane in beam coordinates is @xmath116 so the beam coordinate @xmath34-direction is perpendicular to the plane of incidence .",
    "the angle of incidence of each vector on the cone is therefore given by @xmath117 or @xmath118    whatever the overall incoming polarization @xmath0 it is resolved into the local @xmath119 directions for each component wavevector labelled by @xmath120 each of which also acquires the appropriate reflection coefficient @xmath121 from ( [ eq : rs ] ) , ( [ eq : rp ] ) , with its local angle of incidence provided by ( [ eq : localcos ] ) .",
    "as we are only interested in effects linear in @xmath97 these coefficients effectively become , for @xmath122 @xmath123 the second approximation is only valid if @xmath124 , i.e.  not at the brewster angle .    for a given wavevector @xmath125 the @xmath12 polarization perpendicular to the local plane of incidence",

    "[ fig : vectorcone ] .",
    "when @xmath133 or @xmath134 the local plane of incidence agrees with the plane of incidence of the beam axis , so there is no additional polarization effect .",
    "this dependence on @xmath135 has been interpreted as a spin - orbit effect @xcite , as it implicitly involves considering the local polarization of the beam ( spin ) around the beam azimuth ( orbit ) .",
    "the total transverse reflection dyadic , then , is the sum of the projection matrices weighted by the appropriate reflection coefficient .",
    "before we do so , however , we point out a subtlety made explicit by the introduction of the virtual beam : since the virtual reflected beam comes from reflection , it involves a change in the handedness of the coordinate system ( right - handed circular light is reflected as left - handed , and vice versa ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is natural to make the coordinate systems attached to the incident , virtual and real reflected beams right - handed , so for every plane wave , the triple of wavevector @xmath136 , electrical field , and magnetic field has a positive scalar triple product . to account for this discrepancy we choose",

    "this is a known result as the angular shift is related to the derivatives of the moduli of the reflection coefficients which in total internal reflection are zero @xcite .",

    "in addition to just quantifying the information given in table [ tab : algebraic ] these figures also show the intensity of the reflected scalar encoded in the area of the each circle .",
    "the intensities are normalised with respect to the total reflected beam and should not be seen as indicative for the beam waist , which is usually so large that any spatial shifts are fully contained within its radius .",
    "being able to read out the intensity of a scalar component helps to understanding how shifts of different magnitudes between an orthogonal pair can average to zero for the total shift .",
    "an example is the angular shift for circular polarisation in total internal reflection in fig .",

    "we have presented here a self - contained approach to optical beams shift phenomena which results in a simple linear algebra of @xmath275 matrices , in which the connection between optical beams shifts and weak values is readily established . moreover , on choosing three mutually incompatible bases for the incident and analyzer polarization , we have been able to study the shifts of the centre of mass and the separate polarization components algebraically in a systemic manner , which resulted in table [ tab : algebraic ] . using this table",
    "we have highlighted the existent of symmetries between input and output polarizations , which means that well known effects , such as the spin - hall effect of light @xcite and the ` in plane spin separation of light ' @xcite are accompanied by analogous but reverse effects .",
    "further , we have found a material independent spatial , transverse shift , which can be observed for circular cross - polarization . as optical beams shifts can be used to gain information about the reflecting interface ,",
    "the presence of a ` zero ' , which does not depend on the material is naturally very important .",
    "the connection of beam shifts and weak values is not new and has been pointed out before by hosten and kiwat @xcite and phrased in a purely classical language by aiello and woerdman @xcite , but what hitherto has not been fully appreciated is , how exhaustive the interpretation of optical beam shifts phenomenon as weak values really is .",
    "the interpretation of the angular shift as imaginary part of the weak value in section [ sec : formulae ] makes it obvious that the natural measure for the angular shift is the second moment of the spectrum .",
    "using this as unit explains the difference in the angular goos - hnchen ( gh ) shift between 3d vector beams @xcite and 2d ` sheet ' beams @xcite and also accounts for the recently observed radial mode dependence for the angular gh and imbert - fedorov ( if ) shifts for general laguerre - gaussian modes @xcite .",
    "the vortex - induced shifts discussed in this paper can also be explained as weak values , but the full extent of the analogies between quantum weak measurements and optical beam shifts deserves a separate exposition elsewhere as it can discussed without reference to a given optical beam and material interface @xcite .",
