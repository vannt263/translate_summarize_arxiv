    "there is long standing interest in building a low frequency radio telescope on the far side of the moon ( gorgolewski 1965 ; burke 1985 ; kuiper et al .",
    "1990 ; burns & asbell 1991 ; woan et al .",
    "the reasons are clear ( section 2 ) : no ionosphere , and sheilding from terrestrial radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "two factors have acted to rekindle interest in low frequency radio astronomy from moon .",
    "first , scientifically , efforts to study cosmic reionization through the redshifted hi 21 cm line have spurred numerous ground - based low frequency projects ( section 3 ) . and second is the new nasa initiative to return man to the moon , and beyond .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the advantages of building a radio telescope on the far side of the moon .",
    "we present the primary scientific driver in low frequency astronomy today , namely hi 21 cm studies of cosmic reionization , and discuss some of the near - term ground - based telescopes being designed for these studies .",
    "we also present other very low frequency science programs that are enabled by going to the moon .",
    "we close with a few recommendations for near - term studies that might prove useful for planning a low frequency lunar telescope .",
    "we start with the main advantages for considering the far side of the moon for a low frequency radio telescope .",
    "low frequencies , in the context of this paper , means frequencies , @xmath0mhz ( @xmath1 m ) . in this regime",
    "it becomes cheaper , and possibly more effective , to build arrays of dipoles , which are electronically steered through phasing of the dipole elements , as opposed to steerable parabolic reflectors .",
    "* _ ionospheric opacity : _ the plasma frequency of the earth s ionosphere varies between roughly 10mhz and 20mhz , making the ionosphere optically thick at lower frequencies . for the reionization experiments discussed in section 3 , the relevant frequency range is @xmath2 mhz ,",
    "hence ionospheric opacity is not an issue .",
    "we discuss in section 4 some very low frequency science , in the range 0.1 mhz and 10mhz , that are enabled by going to the moon . * _ ionospheric phase errors : _ the fluctuating ionosphere also cause variations in electronic path - length , which increase as @xmath3 .",
    "hence , fluctuations in the electron content of the ionosphere will preclude low frequency imaging with synthesis arrays unless a correction can be made for electronic phase variations due to the varying ionosphere .",
    "figure 1 shows an example of ionospheric phase errors on source positions using vla data at 74 mhz ( cotton et al .",
    "2004 ; lane et al .",
    "positions of five sources are shown for a series of snap shot images over 10 hours .",
    "a number of interesting phenomena can be seen .",
    "first , the sources are slowly moving in position over time , by @xmath4 over timescales of hours .",
    "these position shifts reflect the changing electronic path - length due to the fluctuating ionosphere ( ie .",
    "tilts in the incoming wavefront due to propagation delay ) .",
    "second , the individual sources move roughly independently .",
    "this is a demonstration of the isoplanatic patch problem , ie .",
    "the excess electrical path - length is different in different directions . at 74 mhz , the typical coherent patch size is about 3@xmath5 to 4@xmath5 .",
    "celestial calibrators further than this distance from a target source no longer give a valid solution for the combined instrumental and propagation delay term required to image the target source . and",
    "third , at the end of the observation there occurs an ionospheric storm , or traveling ionospheric disturbance , which effectively precludes coherent imaging during the event . + new wide field self - calibration techniques , involving multiple phase solutions over the field , or a ` rubber screen ' phase model ( cotton et al . 2004",
    "; hopkins et al . 2003 ) , are being developed that should allow for self - calibration over wide fields .",
    "again , the moon presents a clear advantage in this regard , being beyond the earth s ionosphere . * _ terrestrial radio frequency interference ( rfi ) _ : another problem facing low frequency radio astronomy is terrestrial ( man - made ) interference .",
    "frequencies @xmath6mhz are not protected bands , and commercial allocations include everything from broadcast radio and television , to fixed and mobile communications . at the lowest frequencies ( @xmath7mhz ) the earth s auroral emission dominates .",
    "+ many groups are pursuing methods for rfi mitigation and excision ( see ellingson 2004 ) .",
    "these include : ( i ) using a reference horn , or one beam of a phased array , for constant monitoring of known , strong , rfi signals , ( ii ) conversely , arranging interferometric phases to produce a null at the position of the rfi source , and ( iii ) real - time rfi excision using advanced filtering techniques in time and frequency , of digitized signals both pre- and post - correlation .",
    "the latter requires very high dynamic range ( many bit sampling ) , and very high frequency and time resolution .",
    "+ in the end , the most effective means of reducing interference is to go to the remotest sites .",
    "a number of the near - term low frequency path - finder telescopes ( see section 4 ) , have selected sites in remote regions of western australia and china , because of known low rfi environments .",
    "+ clearly the best location to avoid terrestrial interference is the far - side of the moon .",
    "figure 2 shows the effect of the lunar radio shadow on the rae2 lunar orbiter ( alexander et al .",
    "this orbiter had a low frequency ( @xmath8mhz ) radio receiver .",
    "the figure shows complete blockage of the earth s auroral emission during immersion .",
    "note that this interference blockage is the key argument for the far side of the moon , as opposed to a free - flying space radio telescope .",
    "* _ ease of deployment and maintenance : _ while not a scientific rationale , it should be pointed out that a low frequency telescope may be the easiest astronomical facility to deploy and maintain on the moon .",
    "the antennas and electronics are high tolerance , with wavelengths @xmath9 m and system noise characteristics dominated by the galactic foreground radiation .",
    "deployment could be automated , using either javelin deployment ( eads / astron ) , rollout of thin polyimide films with metalic deposits ( rolss ; lazio et al .",
    "2006 ) , inflatable dipoles ( ludar ; corbin et al .",
    "2005 ) , or deployment by rovers .",
    "likewise , being a phased array , low frequency telescopes are electronically steered , and hence have no moving parts .",
    "lastly , there is no potential difficulty with lunar dust affecting the optics .",
    "cosmic reionization corresponds to the transition from a fully neutral intergalactic medium ( igm ) to an ( almost ) fully ionized igm caused by the uv radiation from the first stars and blackholes .",
    "reionization is a key benchmark in cosmic structure formation , indicating the formation of the first luminous objects .",
    "reionization , and the preceding dark ages , represent the last of the major phases of cosmic evolution to explore .",
    "recent observations of the gunn - peterson effect , ie .",
    "ly-@xmath10 absorption by the neutral igm , toward the most distant quasars ( @xmath11 ) , and the large scale polarization of the cmb , have set the first constraints on the epoch of reionization .",
    "these data , coupled with the study of high-@xmath12 galaxy populations and other observations , suggest that reionization was a complex process , with significant variance in both space and time , starting perhaps as high as @xmath13 , with the last vestiges of the the neutral igm being etched - away by @xmath11 ( fan et al . 2006 ; , ciardi & ferrara 2005 ; loeb 2006 ) .",
    "the most direct and incisive means of studying cosmic reionization is through the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen ( furlanetto et al .",
    "the study of hi 21 cm emission from cosmic reionization entails the study of large scale structure ( lss ) . during this epoch",
    "the entire igm may be neutral , and the lss in question is not simply mass clustering , but involves a combination of structure in cosmic density , neutral fraction , and hi excitation temperature ( loeb 2006 ) .",
    "hence , hi 21 cm observations are potentially the ` richest of all cosmological data sets ' ( loeb & zaldarriaga 2004 ) .",
    "information about the physics of cosmology ( involving the initial perturbations from inflation and the matter content of the universe ) can be separated from the astronomical aspects ( involving galaxy formation ) through the line - of - sight anisotropy imprinted by peculiar velocities on the power - spectrum of 21 cm brightness fluctuations ( barkana & loeb 2005a ) .",
    "we briefly describe a few of the potential hi 21 cm signatures of cosmic reionization .",
    "-1.8 in -1.82 in 0.2 in    * _ global signal : _ the left panel in figure 3 shows the latest predictions of the global ( all sky ) increase in the background temperature due to the hi 21 cm line from the neutral igm ( gnedin & shaver 2003 ) . the predicted hi signal peaks at roughly 20 mk above the foreground at @xmath14 . at higher redshift , prior to igm warming , the kinetic temperature of the igm will be colder than the cmb temperature . in this case ,",
    "ly@xmath10 emission from the first luminous objects can couple the gas kinetic temperature to the hi spin temperature through the resonant scattering of ly@xmath10 photons ( wouthuysen 1952 ; field 1959 ) . in this case , the hi will be seen in absorption against the cmb . since this is an all sky signal , the sensitivity of the experiment is independent of telescope collecting area , and the experiment can be done using small area telescopes at low frequency , with very well controlled frequency response ( rogers & bowman , in prep ; subrahmanyan , in prep ) .",
    "note that the line signal is only @xmath15 that of the mean foreground continuum emission at @xmath16 mhz ( see section 3.2 ) . *",
    "_ power spectra : _ the middle panel in figure 3 shows the predicted power spectrum of spatial fluctuations in the sky brightness temperature due to the hi 21 cm line ( mcquinn et al .",
    "2006 ) . for power spectral analyses the sensitivity",
    "is greatly enhanced relative to direct imaging due to the fact that the universe is isotropic , and hence one can average the measurements in annuli in the fourier ( uv ) domain , ie .",
    "the statistics of fluctuations along an annulus in the uv - plane are equivalent . moreover , unlike the cmb , hi line studies provide spatial and redshift information , and hence the power spectral analysis can be performed in three dimensions .",
    "the rms fluctuations at @xmath17 peak at about 10 mk rms on scales @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) . * _ absorption toward discrete radio sources : _ a interesting alternative to emission studies is the possibility of studying smaller scale structure in the neutral igm by looking for hi 21 cm absorption toward the first radio - loud objects ( agn , star forming galaxies , grbs ) ( carilli et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the right panel of figure 3 shows the predicted hi 21 cm absorption signal toward a high redshift radio source due to the ` cosmic web ' prior to reionization , based on numerical simulations . for a source at @xmath17 ,",
    "these simulations predict an average optical depth due to 21 cm absorption of about 1@xmath20 , corresponding to the ` radio gunn - peterson effect ' , and about five narrow ( few km / s ) absorption lines per mhz with optical depths of a few to 10@xmath20 .",
    "these latter lines are equivalent to the ly @xmath10 forest seen after reionization .",
    "furlanetto & loeb ( 2002 ) predict a similar hi 21 cm absorption line density due to gas in minihalos m@xmath21 and @xmath22 m@xmath21 .",
    "] , as that expected for the 21 cm forest .",
    "this absorption experiment may be the easiest of the hi 21 cm probes of reionization to perform , since it entails absorption against a high brightness temperature object , and hence is less affected by 3d dynamic range issues , and it can use long baselines , which are less susceptable to interference . however , the experiment is predicated on the existence of radio sources at these during reionization .",
    "this question has been considered in detail by carilli et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , haiman et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and jarvis & rawlings ( 2005 ) .",

    "2004 ) . in this simulation ,",
    "the hii regions caused by galaxy formation are seen in the redshift range @xmath25 to 10 , reaching scales up to 2@xmath26 ( frequency widths",
    "@xmath27 mhz @xmath28 mpc physical size ) .",
    "these regions appear as holes in the sky , with ( negative ) brightness temperatures up to 20 mk .",
    "this corresponds to 5@xmath29jy beam@xmath30 in a 2@xmath26 beam at 140 mhz .",
    "only a full square kilometer of collecting will be able to perform the 3d tomographic imaging of the typical structures during reionization ( section 3.3 ) . * _ cosmic stromgren spheres : _ while direct detection of the typical structure of hi and hii regions may be out of reach of the path - finder telescopes ( section 3.2 ) , there is a chance that even these first generation telescopes will be able to detect the rare , very large scale hii regions associated with luminous quasars near the end of reionization .",
    "the expected signal is @xmath31mk @xmath32 on scales @xmath33 to 15@xmath26 , with line widths @xmath34 to 2 mhz ( wyithe et al . 2005 ) , where @xmath35 is the igm neutral fraction , by volume .",
    "this corresponds to 0.5 @xmath32 mjy beam@xmath30 , for a 15@xmath26 beam at @xmath11 to 7 .",
    "a number of groups have calculated the expected hi 21 cm signals from cosmic reionization , including large bubbles associated with bright quasars , and clustering of star forming galaxies ( zaldarriaga et al . 2004 ; wyithe et al . 2005 ; mellema et al . 2006 ; madau et al .",
    "the larger structures will vary from a few to 15 arcmin in size , with a depth of @xmath36 mk . for demonstrative purposes ,",
    "we assume a target signal for detection of 10mk and 10@xmath26 in size at @xmath37 .",
    "this implies an observing frequency of @xmath38mhz , or observing wavelength , @xmath39 m . for reference , at @xmath25 , 10@xmath26 = 3.2 mpc physical size , or in co - moving coordinates 10@xmath26 = 3.2/(1+z ) = 0.36 mpc co - moving , and in terms of the hubble expansion , 3.2 mpc ( physical ) = 1.6 mhz .",
    "the angular size of 10@xmath26 corresponds to a baseline length of 650 m at 158mhz .",
    "the relationship between brightness temperature and flux density is given by :    @xmath40    where s@xmath41 is the flux density in jy , @xmath42 is the angular size , in arcseconds , and @xmath43 is the observing wavelength in centimeters . for reference , a 10mk signal at @xmath39 m and @xmath44 corresponds to 73@xmath29jy .",
    "_ sensitivity : _ the sensitivity of a radio telescope is given by the radiometry equation :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the antenna efficiency , n is the number of antennas , a is the physical collecting area of each antenna , in m@xmath47 , @xmath48 is the bandwidth ( hz ) , and t is the integration time ( seconds ) .",
    "the system temperature , @xmath49 , is the sum of the receiver temperature , which we assume is of order 100 k , and the contribution from the sky foreground .",

    "the sky contributes :    @xmath50    or about 200k at 158mhz . in general , at low frequencies the sky brightness dominates the system temperature .",
    "note that the expected signal is roughly @xmath51 times weaker than the diffuse foreground brightness temperature , even in the coldest regions of the sky .    what collecting area is needed to detect the 73@xmath29jy signal at 4@xmath52 at 158mhz in 1000 hrs , assuming a bandwidth of 1.6mhz and an efficiency of 60% ?",
    "the required area = @xmath53 m@xmath47 .",
    "this corresponds to roughly 9500 dipoles , assuming each dipole collecting area is of order @xmath54 .",
    "the path - finder arrays will likely not have the sensitivity to perform true 3d tomographic imaging of the hi 21 cm signal during reionization .",
    "these arrays are being designed to study the statistical signal , ie .",
    "the power spectrum of brightness temperature fluctuations due to the structure of the neutral igm , in a manner similar to the cobe statistical detection of cmb brightness temperature fluctuations ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "the sensitivity for these near - term arrays to study the power spectrum of the neutral igm during reionization is shown in figure 3 .",
    "_ dynamic range : _ besides raw sensitivity , a significant challenge to wide field , low frequency interferometric imaging is dynamic range , set by residual calibration errors and incomplete fourier spacing coverage . besides the diffuse galactic foreground",
    ", every field will have bright extragalactic and galactic continuum sources .",
    "as a rough estimate for the number of sources expected in a given field , we adopt a field size of @xmath55 , corresponding to the field of view of a receptor tile of @xmath56 dipoles . using the 3c catalog , the bright source counts at 1.9 m follows roughly :    @xmath57    where n is the number of sources per deg@xmath58 brighter than s in jy .",

    "the rms required for a 4@xmath52 detection = 73/4 = 18 @xmath29jy .",

    "the requirement then on the phase calibration is : _",
    "@xmath63_.    there have been numerous studies on how to separate the hi 21 cm signal from the foreground continuum emission at the required levels .",
    "all these techniques rely on the spectral nature of the hi signal .",
    "the foreground emission is syncrotron radiation , and hence shows at most gradual changes with frequency on scales of tens to hundreds of mhz .",
    "the hi signal is a resonant spectral line , and will have structure on scales of khz to a few mhz .",
    "a number of complimentary approaches have been presented for foreground removal ( morales , bowman , & hewitt 2005 ) .",
    "gnedin & shaver ( 2003 ) and wang et al ( 2005 ) consider fitting smooth spectral models ( power - laws or low order polynomials in log space ) to the observed visibilities or images .",
    "morales & hewitt ( 2003 ) and morales ( 2004 ) present a 3d fourier analysis of the measured visibilities , where the third dimension is frequency .",
    "the different symmetries in this 3d space for the signal arising from the noise - like hi emission , versus the smooth ( in frequency ) foreground emission , can be a powerful means of differentiating between foreground emission and the reioniation hi line signal .",

    "( 2004 ) perform a similar analysis , only in the complementary fourier space , meaning cross correlation of spectral channels .",
    "they show that the 21 cm signal will effectively decorrelate for channel separations @xmath64 mhz , while the foregrounds do not .",
    "the overall conclusion of these methods is that spectral decomposition should be adequate to separate synchrotron foregrounds from the hi 21 cm signal from reionization at the mk level , as long as residual , at least in the absence of residual significant , frequency dependent calibration errors .",
    "table 1 summarizes the current experiments under construction to study the hi 21 cm signal from cosmic reionization .",
    "these experiments vary from single dipole antennas to study the all - sky signal , to 10,000 dipole arrays to perform the power spectral analysis , and potentially to image the largest structures during reionization ( eg . the quasar stromgren spheres ) .",
    "most of the experiments have a few to 10% of the collecting area of the ska , and there are many common features .",
    "first , they all rely on some form of a wide - band dipole or spiral antenna , eg .",
    "log - periodic yagis , sleeve dipoles , or bow - ties , with steering of the array response through electronic phasing of the elements .",
    "second , the front - end electronics are relatively simple ( amplifier / balun ) , since the system performance is dominated by the sky brightness temperature .",
    "third , most rely on a grouping of dipoles into tiles or stations , to decrease the field - of - view , and to decrease the data rate into the correlator to a managable level . and forth",
    ", the large number of array elements , and the need for wide - field , high dynamic range imaging over an octave , or more , of bandwidth , demand major computing resources , both for basic cross - correlation , and subsequent imaging and analysis . for example , assuming an array of 1000 tiles , a 100 mhz bandwidth , and 8 bit sampling , the total data rate coming into the correlator is 1.6 tbit s@xmath30 .",

    "<S> we discuss low frequency radio astronomy from the moon , predominantly in the context of studying the neutral intergalactic medium during cosmic reionization using the hi 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> the epoch of reionization is the next frontier in observational cosmology , and hi 21 cm studies are recognized as the most direct probe of this key epoch in cosmic structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> current constraints on reionization indicate that the redshifted hi 21 cm signals will likely be in the range of 100 mhz to 180 mhz , with the pre - reionization signal going to as low as 10 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the primary observational challenges to these studies are :    * ionospheric phase fluctuations * terrestrial radio frequency interference * galactic and extragalactic foreground radiation .    going to the far side of the moon </S>",
    "<S> removes the first two of these challenges . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a low frequency telescope will be relatively easy to deploy and maintain on the moon , at least compared to other , higher frequency telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the potential 21 cm signals from reionization , and beyond , and the telescope specifications needed to measure these signals . </S>",
    "<S> we then describe ground - based projects currently underway to study the hi 21 cm signal from cosmic reionization . </S>",
    "<S> we include a brief discussion of other very low frequency science enabled by being outside the earth s ionosphere .    </S>",
    "<S> the near - term ground - based projects will act as path - finders for a potential future low frequency radio telescope on the moon , both in terms of initial scientific results on the hi 21 cm signal from cosmic reionization , and in terms of the telescope design and observing techniques required to meet the stringent sensitivity and dynamic range requirements . if it is found that the terrestrial interference environment , or ionospheric phase fluctuations , preclude ground - based studies of reionization , then it becomes imperative to locate future telescopes on the far side of the moon . besides pursuing these path - finder reionization telescopes , </S>",
    "<S> we recommend a number of near - term studies that could help pave the way for low frequency astronomy on the moon . </S>"
