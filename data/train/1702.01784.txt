    "brown dwarfs ( bds ) are substellar objects ranging in mass between low - mass main - sequence stars and giant planets . they are generally defined as having masses above @xmath013 m@xmath1 , the minimum mass required for an object to ignite deuterium burning in its core , and below @xmath080 m@xmath1 , or 0.075 m@xmath3 , above which a dense object becomes sufficiently massive to fuse atomic hydrogen into helium in its core @xcite .",
    "the existence of bds was first suggested by @xcite , on the basis of theoretical calculations , and the realization that as stars of sufficiently low mass condense out of the interstellar medium , they will become dense enough to be supported by electron degeneracy pressure before they become hot enough to fuse hydrogen in their core .",
    "however , there was not a confirmed observation of a bd until 1995 @xcite .",
    "technological advancements continue to produce new bd discoveries with increasing detail .",
    "these new data give a statistical sense of these objects and place observational constraints on their theoretical properties and proposed formation mechanisms .",
    "one of the most important observational constraints on bd formation is known as the `` brown dwarf desert '' , or the lack of companions within the mass range of @xmath010 - 80 m@xmath1 with orbital radii less than @xmath05 au around solar - type stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the significance of the brown dwarf desert by analyzing companions with orbital periods less than 5 years around sun - like stars .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath016% of sun - like stars have close ( p @xmath4 5 yr ) companions more massive than jupiter , but @xmath41% are bds .",
    "the minimum number of companions per unit interval in log mass , or the driest part of the desert , is at m @xmath0 31 m@xmath1 @xcite . @xcite created a catalogue of all known brown dwarf companions around solar - type stars , which totaled 62 bds . through statistical analysis",

    "of these , 14,840 had at least eight visits ; this subset had a median baseline of 384 days , median of 13 visits , and a median signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of 12.2 per visit . with a final count of 382 candidate companions ( including 112 bd companion candidates , 71 orbiting evolved stars )",

    "@xcite argue that this result agrees with the work of @xcite who find that the the bd desert may not be as  dry \" as initially thought when considering stars more massive than the sun , as well as evidence that the bd desert is a special case for solar - mass stars @xcite .",

    ", @xcite find that f - type stars may host massive companions for a significantly longer time than g - type stars for orbital periods less than five days ; however , they conclude that brown dwarf occurrence should largely be unaffected by tidal decay for orbital periods",
    "greater than ten days , regardless of host mass .",
    "debate continues on valid formation mechanisms of bds and whether or not different formation mechanisms dominate in different mass , period , and eccentricity regimes .",
    "three main mechanisms are advocated in the field : ( i ) the ejection of protostellar embryos from their natal cloud cores @xcite , ( ii ) the fragmentation of protostellar discs @xcite , or ( iii ) collapsing molecular cloud cores @xcite , i.e. , the same process as sun - like stars .    through their statistical study",
    "@xcite reported that bd companions with minimum masses below 42.5 m@xmath1 have an eccentricity distribution consistent with that of massive planets , while those with masses above 42.5 m@xmath1 have an eccentricity distribution consistent with that of binaries .",

    "@xcite conclude that bd companions with minimum masses below 42.5 m@xmath1 likely form in a protoplanetary disc through the disc gravitational instability scenario , and their eccentricity is excited through scattering , while bd companions with minimum masses above 42.5 m@xmath1 likely form in the same way as stars , through molecular cloud fragmentation .",
    "@xcite find 14 candidate bd companions around metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 -0.5 ) , also challenging the core - accretion formation model for bds , which they find unsurprising given that @xcite observed that lower metallicity populations generally have a higher number of binaries .    here",

    "specifically , this set - up combines a michelson interferometer and a medium resolution ( r @xmath0 11,000 ) spectrograph , which overlays interferometer fringes on a long - slit stellar spectrum @xcite .",
    "unlike echelle spectrographs , which require many orders and a large detector area to achieve high rv precision , this unique setup allows simultaneous observation of 60 stars with moderate to high rv precision .",
    "@xcite presents a complete overview of the principles and physics behind the dfdi method .",
    "the general creation process of the marvels dfdi spectra is explained by @xcite .",
    "starlight from the telescope or light from a calibration source , a tungsten lamp shining through a temperature - stabilized iodine gas cell ( tio ) , is fed into an optical fiber .",
    "the incoming beam is split in two by a michelson - type interferometer .",
    "a parallel glass plate creates a fixed optical delay between the two plates of the interferometer .",
    "a virtual white fringe pattern is created and re - imaged onto the entrance slit of the spectrometer , and is then dispersed by the medium - resolution grating @xcite .",
    "the dispersed fringes are recorded on a detector .",
    "the resulting fringes overlaid on the 2d spectra contain high spatial frequency doppler information allowing for precise rv measurements .",
    "@xcite displayed the ability of the dfdi method with the detection of a giant planet of minimum mass @xmath00.488 m@xmath1 ( hd 102195b ) using the precursor to the marvels instrument , the exoplanet tracker .",
    "early analysis of marvels data showed good instrumental performance over timescales of less than a month . by observing a rv stable star or a known planet hosting star",
    ", @xcite found the root mean square ( rms ) errors vary between only 1 - 2 times the photon noise for rv measurements within one month .",
    "however , when analyzing reference stars over multiple month periods , @xcite found rms errors as large as a factor of 5 times higher than the photon limiting error . they acknowledged the need for further consideration of long - term effects such as distortion , illumination , and large barycentric velocity . during marvels data pipeline development , @xcite found systematic rv errors in the form of month - to - month offsets at the level of tens to hundreds of m s@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite inferred that the systematic errors may be due to imperfections in the detailed preprocessing of the images .",
    "@xcite provide an overview of the history of the marvels instrument and the associated data reduction .",
    "the original pipeline results are presented in the sdss data release 11 ( dr11 ) as the  cross correlation function \" ( ccf ) and dfdi reductions , which revealed the large instrumental errors and the requirement of a new analysis method .",
    "this discovery prompted the creation of a new refurbished pipeline designed to understand and correct the systematic errors @xcite .",
    "this refurbished pipeline is presented in the sdss data release 12 ( dr12 ) as the  university of florida one dimensional \" ( uf1d ) reductions .",
    "@xcite summarize the differences between the ccf+dfdi and uf1d reductions including changes in the calibration of the wavelength solution on the detector , identification and extraction of each spectrum , and the measurement of the slant of the interferometric comb and of the resulting interference pattern of the absorption - line features .",
    "the dr12 uf1d reductions do not show great improvements over the dr11 ccf+dfdi reductions ; however , the uf1d reductions resulted in a better understanding of the systematic errors of the instrument and thus allowed more accurate error estimations for individual targets .",
    "@xcite improved upon the dr12 uf1d results by adopting a ` lucky rv ' method , where statistically preferred regions of the spectra are used in the determination of overall rv and poorer regions are discarded once performance deteriorates for a given target ( each star goes through @xmath01,000 iterations to randomly select a specific combination and number of regions that create the best rv performance ) . using this new method combined with two new filters , which result in an overall rejection of @xmath020% of all observations , @xcite was able to greatly reduce large long - term rv errors that plagued previous pipelines .",
    "the improved uf1d pipeline with lucky rv and filters results in a rv precision of @xmath066 - 114 m s@xmath5 ( photon limits @xmath027 - 90 m s@xmath5 ) for 8 - 12 magnitude stable stars , respectively .",
    "the uf1d pipeline reductions identified that optical fiber illumination changes , likely isolated to fiber couplings in the gang connector , caused variations between the stellar and calibration fiber illuminations over the lifetime of the survey , causing the largest measurement error in the marvels rvs .",
    "however , the final uf1d pipeline still does not completely remove the systematic offsets from all targets , with an overall influence from offset errors having a median of 64.3 m s@xmath5 ; the lucky rv method also has the disadvantage of excluding @xmath020% of observations @xcite .    after the refinement of the uf1d pipeline , a new  university of florida two dimensional \" ( uf2d ) pipeline was developed in order to use the interferometric power of marvels and take full advantage of the instrument s capabilities . rather than relying on the underlying physics of interferometry ,",
    "as previous 2d dfdi pipelines generally did @xcite , the uf2d pipeline uses a simpler and more visually understandable method , which is outlined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "two new innovations , specifically 2d modeling of the underlying fringe density distortion and the correction of temporal distortions , have led to current rv performance of @xmath060 - 96 m s@xmath5 for 8 - 12 magnitude rv stable stars , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : rms ] shows uf2d rv results for stable stars of various magnitudes .",
    "however , the main improvement of the uf2d pipeline is the lack of large errors found over months and years that have previously plagued the survey .",
    "most notably , combining the results from adjacent beams of the same star improves rv accuracy , which was not the case with 1d data due to systematic errors dominating both beams .",
    "figure [ fig : pipelinerv ] displays the overall rv performance for each marvels pipeline .",
    "we use these new uf2d rv results for our current search of substellar companions .",
    "20% of observations altogether . the uf2d single beam pipeline performance rivals the lucky rv pipeline performance , but has the advantage of including all portions of each spectra , increasing signal - to - noise . while previous pipelines were too unstable to combine adjacent beams of the same star due to systematic errors , the uf2d pipeline has the capability to combine beams resulting in the overall best marvels pipeline performance . ]",
    "the marvels survey has already identified two low - mass stellar companions to solar - type stars ( marvels-2b , @xcite ; marvels-3b , @xcite ) , as well as three bd companions ( marvels-4b , @xcite ; marvels-5b , @xcite ; marvels-6b , @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite warns of a similar situation where the marvels target tyc 3010 - 01494 - 1 , a highly eccentric spectroscopic binary , initially appeared as a single star with a substellar companion with minimum mass of @xmath050 m@xmath1 despite an extensive amount of observation and analysis .",
    "marvels observed @xmath05,500 stars during its 4-year survey , and produced 3,257 stars with 10 or more valid rv observations in our latest uf2d pipeline .",
    "previous results show that finding substellar companions in this dataset is susceptible to error . examining each star",
