    "<S> the _ ab initio _ calculations suggest that the superconducting state in @xmath0 under the pressure ( @xmath1 ) at @xmath2 gpa has the highest critical temperature among the examined hydrogen - rich compounds . for this reason </S>",
    "<S> , the relevant thermodynamic parameters of the superconducting state in @xmath0 have been determined ; a wide range of the coulomb pseudopotential has been assumed : @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that : ( i ) the critical temperature ( @xmath4 ) changes in the range from @xmath5 k to @xmath6 k. ( ii ) the values of the ratio of the energy gap to the critical temperature ( @xmath7 ) can be found in the range from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the ratio of the specific heat jump ( @xmath10 ) to the value of the specific heat in the normal state ( @xmath11 ) , which has been represented by the symbol @xmath12 , takes the values from @xmath13 to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) the ratio @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the critical thermodynamic field , changes from @xmath17 to @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the above results mean that even for the strong electron depairing correlations the superconducting state in @xmath0 is characterized by a very high value of @xmath4 , and the remaining thermodynamic parameters significantly deviate from the predictions of the bcs theory . </S>",
    "<S> the study has brought out the expressions that correctly predict the values of the thermodynamic parameters for the superconducting state in @xmath0 and for the compounds : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> next , in the whole family of the hydrogen - rich compounds , the possible ranges of the values have been determined for @xmath4 , @xmath25 , @xmath12 , and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that the maximum value of the critical temperature can be equal to @xmath27 k , which very well correlates with @xmath4 for metallic hydrogen ( @xmath28 tpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> other parameters ( @xmath25 , @xmath12 , and @xmath26 ) should not deviate from the predictions of the bcs theory more than the analogous parameters for @xmath0 . </S>",
