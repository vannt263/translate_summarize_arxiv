    "in the last year , progress has been reported on theories providing a framework for human commuting patterns @xcite .",
    "both papers suggest that the main ingredient in a ` universal ' law predicting human mobility patterns is topological , i.e. it does not directly depend on metrical distance .",
    "this discovery aims to rewrite the assumptions that have been made during the last century on mobility patterns and in particular the traditional _ gravity model _ first suggested for use in human interaction systems by carey ( 1859 ) @xcite and popularised by zipf in 1946 @xcite and the _ intervening opportunities model _ introduced by stouffer in 1940 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that lately , purely topological relations have also been found to be leading components for the explanation of animal collective behaviour @xcite .    in particular in @xcite a simple theory called the _ radiation model",
    "_ , based on diffusion dynamics , has been developed and the model appears to match experimental data well .",
    "the model gives exact analytical results and it has the additional desirable feature of being parameter - free , i.e. it has the characteristics of a universal theory .    in this contribution",
    "we use three different datasets in order to assess the universality , accuracy , and robustness of the newly proposed radiation model applied to human mobility and public transport infrastructure .",
    "the datasets we use are available as : ( i ) a complete multimodal network for transportation in the uk , comprising the road network for bus and coach , the rail networks for tube and rail , and the airline networks for plane .",
    "the weights on these networks consist of the volumes of the transport ( vehicles , trains , planes ) from transport time - tables ; ( ii ) commuting patterns for england and wales at ward level resolution from the 2001 population census ; and ( iii ) population density data for the uk at ward level resolution , also from the census .",
    "our first concern about the radiation model is the presumption of universality . in our interpretation ,",
    "` universality ' means that the model can be applied at all spatial scales , all time periods , and to different places .",
    "regarding the system scale , we show that among cities , the radiation model is broadly accurate for commuting , while it is not accurate at all in forecasting both the transportation patterns between cities , or for the commuting flows within london . regarding the applicability of the model to different countries",
    ", we notice that the radiation model is normalised to an infinite population system .",
    "we derive the correct normalisation for finite systems and we show that it deviates from the one derived in @xcite at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this deviation is not really appreciable for large population systems at the scale of counties in the us , but it becomes relevant for smaller systems composed of much smaller but equivalent entities such as wards in the regions including england and wales .",
    "the gravity model is based on empirical evidence that the commuting between two places _ i _ and _ j _ , with origin population @xmath0 and destination population @xmath1 , is proportional to the product of these populations and inversely proportional to a power law of the distance between them .",
    "many studies have been carried on such a model , where it is often subject to additional constraints on the generation and attractions of flows , and on the total travel distance ( or cost ) observed .",
    "these variants can be derived consistently using information minimising or entropy maximising procedures @xcite .    in our research",
    "we employ two models .",
    "one is a four - parameter one , that is the one also used in @xcite and was first stated in this form by alonso ( 1976 ) @xcite :    @xmath2    where _ a _ is a normalisation factor and @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the parameters of the model , which can be determined by multiple regression analysis .",
    "the second is a simpler perhaps more elegant model , that just carries the parameter as the exponent of the denominator and it is the one that is more frequently used in transportation modelling @xmath6          the radiation model tracks its origin from a simple particle diffusion model , where particles are emitted at a given location and have a certain probability _",
    "p _ of being absorbed by surrounding locations .",
    "it comes out that the probability for a particle to be absorbed is independent of _ p _ , but it depends only on the origin population @xmath7 , the destination population @xmath8 and on the population in a circle whose centre is the origin and radius the distance between the origin and the destination , minus the population at the origin and the population at the destination , @xmath9 .",
    "then the number of commuters , that we call @xmath10 , from location _",
    "i _ to location _",
    "j _ is estimated to be a fraction of the commuters from population _",
    "i _ , @xmath11 , that is :    @xmath12    p * ) _ for the us counties analysed in @xcite . in the right panel , the cumulative frequency distribution for the population size _ p(p@xmath13p * ) _ for the cities of england and wales.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the most interesting aspect of eq .",
    "is that it is independent of the distance and that it is parameter free .",
    "nevertheless eq . has been derived in the thermodynamic limit , that is for an infinite system .",
    "it is easy to show that for a finite system the normalisation brings us to a slightly different form of the radiation model , that is    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the total sample population and we have @xmath16 for @xmath17 .    in a finite system",
    "@xmath18 underestimates the commuting flows by a factor @xmath19 . for a very large system with uniform population eq .",
    "is a very good approximation , but actually the city size distribution is not uniform for it usually follows a very heterogeneous skewed distribution , such as zipf s law @xcite .    to understand the deviations of eq . from eq .",
    ", we measure the factor @xmath20 for the dataset used in @xcite and for a smaller system : the region composed of england and wales . in the former case",
    "the us system is very large .",
    "the analysis is performed at the county level and that reduces the population heterogeneity of the system .",
    "we find that the largest deviation is in the flows from anderson county and this is of around @xmath21 .",
    "this is not a particularly large deviation , but the same measure for england and wales for example brings a deviation for the commuting flows from london @xmath22 , that is a considerably larger deviation .    as we have shown that eq .",
    "is not universal , but scale dependent , a better choice for our investigation of uk commuting patterns is eq . .",
    "in @xcite @xmath23 is considered to be proportional to @xmath0 , that is a good estimate , while in our analysis we derive its value directly from the commuting network @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 , that is in network theory terminology the out - strength of location _ i _",
    "@xcite .",
    "moreover in @xcite the model is based on job opportunities that are considered to be proportional to population .",
    "in fact eq . can be rewritten in network theory terminology .",
    "hence given that @xmath24 are the elements of the weighted directional adjacency matrix representing the commuting between locations _",
    "i _ and _ j _ , we define the out - strength of vertex _",
    "i _ as @xmath26 , and the in - strength as @xmath27 .",
    "then we have @xmath28 here @xmath29 and @xmath30 where _ d(i , j ) _ is the distance between _",
    "j_. eq . is an interesting relation between the commuting flows of the network which can be verified in itself .",
    "in fact the in - strength of a given vertex represents the job opportunities in that location , since it quantifies exactly the number of people going to work in that location .",
    "in this section we test the models defined in eq . , eq . and eq . against empirical data . in the first subsection we analyse the commuting between the cities of england and wales",
    "( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , thereby simulating the models at macro - scales , while in the second subsection we analyse the commuting between the wards of london ( see right panel of fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , simulating the models at micro - scales .          in this subsection , we test the gravity model defined in eq .",
    "and eq . and the radiation model defined in eq . against the empirical data for the cities of england and wales . in this study ,",
    "city clusters have been defined via a two step process using the population for the 8850 census area statistics ( cas ) of wards in england and wales from the 2001 population census @xcite . in the first step ,",
    "those wards with population density above 14 persons per hectare are selected from the rest ; in the second step , adjacent selected wards have been grouped to form a total of 535 city clusters @xcite .",
    "we show these cities in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    on the top of this socio - geographical dataset",
    ", we analyse data for the commuting between these cities using the 2001 census journey to work data which specifies , for all surveyed commuters , the origin ward they travel from  their home location  and their destination ward  their work location . from this data , we have calculated the number of commuters between all pairs of cities in england and wales .",
    "for this study , we have also used data for the number of trains and buses moving between these cities .",
    "this information has been derived from timetable data held by the national public transport data repository ( nptdr ) .",
    "this data includes all public transport services running in england , wales and scotland between the 5th and the 11th of october 2009 .",
    "the data is composed by two data sets : the naptan ( national public transport access nodes ) dataset and the transxchange files .",
    "the former includes all public transport nodes categorised by travel mode and geo - located in space .",
    "the latter one has a series of transport modal files for each county within england , wales and scotland ( 143 counties in total ) , with information on all services running within the county .",
    "the travel modes included are air , train , bus , coach , metro and ferry .",
    "each service includes routing information as a series of naptan referenced stops each with its corresponding departure and waiting time . in this paper , we have deduced the number of trains and buses operating between all pairs of cities on a typical working day ",
    "24h  by first assigning a ward area to each bus and train stop via spatial point - in - polygon queries , and then extending this assignment to city areas .",
    "it is worth noticing that in @xcite the analysis has been made over us counties , that are artificial units , while in this analysis we consider cities as natural entities for commuting .",
    "the different choice is not merely speculative , since counties have different physics and statistical properties than cities .",
    "it is well known that the city size distribution follows zipf s law @xcite .",
    "that means that city size distribution has a fat tail characterised by the scale of very large cities .",
    "the representation of the system in terms of counties introduces an artificial cut - off in the tail of the distribution , cutting down the tail , as we show in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "it is sufficient to think of the fact that new york city is made up of 5 different counties ( boroughs ) , so that in a county level analysis its population is split between those 5 counties .    [",

    "2 we show the results of the @xmath31 test for the different models . we can observe straight away that the models all perform rather badly , implying that the structure of a metropolis is more complex than the one forecasted by both the radiation and by gravity models .    in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the analysis for the commuting patterns , i.e. the models against the real data .",
    "we perform a multiple regression analysis to find the best fit with the data for eq . , whose results are shown in the figure caption .    in the second from top , left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we show the average number of commuters in london as a function of the distance .",
    "the plot shows that real data decay faster than a power law with the distance , and this behaviour is captured by none of the gravity models , that tend to follow a power law behaviour . on the other hand the radiation model forecasts a good amount of commuting for short distances and a rapid decay , but",
    "this does not reproduce the data well either .",
    "in the adjacent panel we show the correlations between the commuting flows and the destination population . for london ,",
    "this is counter intuitive , since the correlation analysis shows a few large peaks for wards with very small population .",
    "this phenomena resides in the fact that the wards where most of the jobs are concentrated in london are not residential wards .",
    "this evidence would let us think that the approximation _",
    "ward population_/_ward employment _ is not valid for london and that we should take this bias into account in our analysis .    in the right panel of the same figure",

    "the @xmath31 values are displayed and we can see that the models do not perform very well , but still better than for the commuters case .",
    "the correlations for the number of buses with the distance display an exponential tail , that has not been picked up by any of the models . as for the commuter case , we see the strongest correlations with distance and @xmath9 , while the correlations with destination populations are ill - defined .",
    "one could argue that the poor results obtained applying the commuting models to the london intra - commuting flows could reside in the approximation validity of the employment data with the population size , in the case of the london wards .    to address this question , in the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , we show the frequency distribution @xmath34 of the population size @xmath35 for the london s wards .",
    "this is well fitted by a gaussian distribution centred around 11300 people .",
    "this is not a surprise since the ward boundaries have been designed to have approximatively the same population size .    in the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , we show instead the cumulative frequency distribution @xmath32 for the number of people @xmath36 working in a given ward .",
    "this is a skew distribution with a broad tail , well fitted by a power law @xmath37 , with exponent @xmath38 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the approximation _ population size_/_employment data _ , that has been shown to be valid in the case of counties in us , is not valid in the case of london s wards .",
    "in particular , we see that employment @xmath36 follow a distribution that suggests a complex and hierarchical organization for these resources within the city .",
    "in fact , from the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , where we measure the average number of employees @xmath33 as a function of the ward population size , we can see that apart from some non trivial deviations for small population size , there are not significant correlations . these deviations are related to the fact that the most significant employment locations in london often have a very small population .",
    "we can now check whether eq .",
    "5 could be a more appropriate choice in order to describe commuting flows inside of a city , instead of eq .",
    "4 . in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , we show the results of eq . 5 applied to the commuting between gla wards , versus the real commuting flows , in the same style and notation of fig .",
    "we notice that the plot is very similar to the one obtained using eq . 4 and the @xmath39 tells us that using eq.5 instead of eq.4 does not improve the goodness of the fit .",
    "this implies that failure of the radiation model in forecasting urban commuting flows does not reside in approximating population size / employment , but in the complexity of the system @xcite .",
    "human mobility is an outstanding problem in science . in more than one century of active work and observation ,",
    "the gravity model has been considered the best option to model such a phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a new statistical model based on physical science @xcite has re - opened the debate on the topic .",
    "in particular the apparent independence of the radiation model from metrical distance and its property of being parameter - free is a significant and desirable change from past practice .",
    "the model needs to be tested in many different circumstances so that its wider applicability can be assessed .    in this paper",
    "we address the reliability of the radiation model against the gravity model for large scale commuting and transportation networks in england and wales and for the intra - urban commuting and transportation network for the london region .",
    "the first thing we notice is that both models fail to describe human mobility within london . in this sense",
    "we argue that commuting at the city scale still lacks a valid model and that further research is required to understand the mechanism behind urban mobility .",
    "in fact , the phenomena of socio - geographical segregation @xcite and residential / business ward specialisation @xcite are key drivers in determining the structure of flows and the density of population in the city and these are not reflected by these statistical models @xcite .    for england and wales",
    ", we first introduce the correct normalisation for finite systems in the radiation model .",
    "such a normalisation affects the flows from london by a factor of 17% .",
    "then we notice that the models are not very good in describing transportation data , such as bus and train flows , while they can be considered acceptable for modelling the commuting flows .",
    "the gravity model ii of eq.[eq_2 _ ] fails to describe commuting models , and confirms that commuting correlations with population at origin and destination is not just linear .",
    "the gravity model is satisfactory in describing the commuting flows and surely much better than the radiation model , even if the latter has the advantage to be parameter free that turns out to be useful in the cases where there is no data available to estimate any parameters .",
    "nevertheless from the fluctuation analysis it emerges that there is a consistent portion of the distance / destination population phase - space where the radiation model gives better estimates of the gravity model in terms of srensen - dice coefficient .",
    "this means that for large distances and small and moderate destination population scales , the principles of the radiation model are reliable and that mobility patterns can be approached by a diffusion model where intervening opportunities on the commuting paths prevail on the distance of such paths .",
    "however , the modest overall radiation model performance in terms of @xmath31 indicates that more research on the subject has to be done in order to improve the model reliability .",
    "other ways to represent the commuting system are possible .",
    "for example , if we were to grid all the data thereby strictly defining population and employment as density measures , this would change the dynamics of the gravity and radiation models in that they have been originally specified to deal with counts of activity data like population and employments rather than their densities .",
    "moreover the tradition in this field is to work with data that is available in administrative units rather than approximate that data on a grid because these units reflect changes in the spatial system over time .",
    "we believe that the best way to conduct this study is to consider urban conglomerations as the natural entities involved in commuting flows .",
    "this choice relates to a well settled tradition in statistical physics that consider cities as well defined entities , such as in the zipf s and gibrat s law .",
