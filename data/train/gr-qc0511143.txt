    "for most of the past decade , the main theoretical thrust in gravitational research has been directed toward obtaining stable and accurate numerical models of compact - object binary systems .",
    "one of the most difficult problems to tackle has been the control of exponentially growing instabilities that degrade the quality of any simulation and , eventually , terminate it .",
    "general relativistic numerical simulations of bns systems have made significant progress in the past years @xcite , in particular with the addition of advanced numerical techniques such as amr @xcite .",
    "the numerical formulations employed to simulate astrophysical systems can be divided in unconstrained and constrained methods .",
    "unconstrained formulations like adm @xcite and bssn @xcite simply evolve the gravitational fields without any attempts at controlling the violation of the time independent hamiltonian and momentum constraints ; these equations are merely monitored to gauge the accuracy of the model . constrained formalisms , on the other hand ,",
    "enforce the satisfaction of the constraint equations at either the analytical level ( i.e. , ingraining them in some way in the time evolution equations ) or at the numerical level ( i.e. , regularly solving the constraints during the evolution ) .",
    "while constrained methods have been applied mostly to problems with spherical @xcite and axial symmetry @xcite , there have been recent applications to three - dimensional scenarios @xcite .",
    "we propose in this and a companion article @xcite ( from now on , paper i ) an alternative type of evolution in which the hamiltonian and momentum constraints are only approximately solved at every time step , gently steering the evolution toward the space of solutions of these equations without completely forcing their numerical satisfaction . in paper",
    "i we described a method that controls the hamiltonian constraint violation ( _ hamiltonian relaxation _ or hr ) . in this paper",
    "we introduce a complementary scheme that reduces the momentum constraint residuals ( _ momentum relaxation _ or mr ) .",
    "the constraint relaxation techniques utilize the conformal decomposition of the spatial metric and extrinsic curvature presented by york @xcite , which has traditionally been used to solve the initial value problem for binary systems  @xcite . in this decomposition , a conformal factor @xmath2 factored out of the spatial metric and a longitudinal addition to the extrinsic curvature generated from a vector potential @xmath1 are used to satisfy the hamiltonian and the three components of the momentum constraint respectively .",
    "hr drives @xmath2 to the solution space of the hamiltonian constraint by means of a parabolic equation for the conformal factor , in the spirit of the k - driver @xcite used for the lapse .",
    "the mr method described in this paper uses @xmath1 to push the simulation toward the space of solutions of the momentum constraint . in both cases ,",
    "a full relaxation of @xmath2 and @xmath1 would lead to the numerical solution of the constraints .",
    "however , the stability of the relaxation methods relies on gently updating these fields during the evolution .",
    "we show in [ appendix_ct ] that a full relaxation scheme becomes unstable rather quickly when used in combination with bssn .",
    "we tested the new algorithms by simulating binary neutron stars ( bns ) in circular orbits and show that the use of these techniques results in a notable improvement of the overall quality of the simulation .",
    "hr not only suppresses the hamiltonian constraint violation but also contributes to a more stable behavior in the total angular momentum of the system .",
    "mr contribution is mostly confined to quenching the momentum constraint violation .",
    "the bns simulation runs for about two orbits before stopping .",
    "one of the main reasons for the degradation of the simulation quality is the use of a shift vector frozen to its initial value ( @xmath3-freeze ) .",
    "this choice , while very convenient when testing new algorithms , becomes inadequate as soon as the stars move appreciably from their initial position .",
    "given that our simulations are performed in the frame that rotates with the binary , this occurs rather late in the run .",
    "the second cause is related to inappropriate boundary conditions for the rest of the gravitational fields .",
    "the use of radiation ( sommerfeld ) conditions in rotating frames becomes troublesome for large grids in rotating frames .",
    "these problems will be addressed in future work .",

    "we introduced in paper i the hamiltonian relaxation technique that draws on the same idea of controlling the hamiltonian constraint violating modes by adjusting @xmath2 .",
