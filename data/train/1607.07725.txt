    "it is widely accepted that the non - thermal radiation in blazars is produced within a relativistic jet directed towards the observer .",
    "however , the mechanism of energization of particles and their radiation is not fully understood .",
    "recently , simple scenarios exploiting collisions of compact objects with the jet plasma reached some attention .",
    "in fact , many different types of compact objects ( e.g. stars , clouds or even globular clusters , fragments of supernova remnants or pulsar wind nebulae ) can be immersed within the jet , forming an obstacle for the jet plasma .",
    "it has been proposed that particles , accelerated on the shocks appearing as a result of collisions of the jet plasma with stellar winds , can produce high energy @xmath0-rays ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this work ,",
    "we consider another encounter scenario in which relativistic particles , already present in the fast moving blob , interact with the dense radiation of a star within the jet .",
    "relativistic leptons , which are isotropic in the blob , comptonize stellar radiation to gev - tev energies .",
    "the radiation field of the star is strong enough that @xmath0-rays produced in the inverse compton process can initiate the @xmath1 pair cascade in the stellar radiation . to study such a scenario we developed a dedicated monte carlo code tracking an electromagnetic cascade in the anisotropic radiation field of a star .",
    "we calculate the @xmath0-ray spectra emerging from such process and discuss their features . as an example",
    ", we show that the @xmath0-ray spectrum and light curve observed from a distant flat spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) pks1222 + 21 during its 2010 orphan @xmath0-ray flare might be explained in terms of such a scenario .",
    "we propose that blobs of relativistic plasma , moving in jets of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , can encounter from time to time the luminous stars which form a quasi - spherical halo around the central super - massive black hole ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "for example , in the nearby active radio galaxy cen  a , the current star formation rate ( @xmath22 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ) should result in the production of @xmath5 m@xmath3 of young stars during the duty cycle of the cen a active nucleus .",
    "we can thus expect @xmath23@xmath6 stars with masses above 20 m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a large number of these stars should be immersed in the jet pointing towards the observer . in the case of a simple conical jet ,",
    "the number of stars is estimated to be of the order of @xmath283@xmath7 , where we assumed that the jet opening angle is determined by the lorentz factor of the flow @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in the case of a parabolic jet ,",
    "the number of stars depends in a more complicated way on the parameters of the jet but is expected to be also significant since the perpendicular extend of the jet on a parsec distance scale from its base are of similar order ( see estimates in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] ) .",
    "the cen  a nucleus is also immersed in a quasi - spherical bulge of late type stars with the number estimated as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the total number of luminous red giants can be as large as @xmath210@xmath11 , if only @xmath210@xmath12 of these bulge stars are in the red giant phase .",
    "therefore , the interaction of a relativistic blob with the radiation field of such luminous stars within a jet of an active galaxy seems to be quite likely .    in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we explain the basic properties of the blob - star interaction model . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we apply such scenario to the extreme flare observed from pks1222 + 21 . in section  [ sec5 ] , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we assume that the blob , a quasi - cylindrical region within the jet containing relativistic electrons , moves along the jet with a fixed lorentz factor @xmath13 .",
    "the blob is characterised by its radius @xmath14 and longitudinal extend , @xmath15 ( measured in the reference frame of the star ) .",
    "the radius of the blob has to be smaller than the local perpendicular extend of the jet @xmath16 . in the case of a simple conical jet , @xmath17 cm , where @xmath18 pc is the distance from the jet base . in the case of a parabolic jet",
    ", @xmath16 can be modelled as , @xmath19 cm . as an example",
    ", the parameter @xmath20 is obtained from the observation of the jet in the nearby radio galaxy m87 ( see sect .  4.4 in @xcite ) , and @xmath21 cm is the schwarzschild radius of the m87 black hole .",
    "we assume that the longitudinal extend of relativistic electrons within the blob can be described by a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of @xmath15 .",
    "such a blob , when passing the stellar radiation , assumed to be point like , should produce a flare on the time scale determined by @xmath15 .",
    "note that the emission is produced by successive layers of the blob as they enter in the fixed volume around the star , rather than from the whole blob traversing the jet .",
    "thus , the observed duration of the emission is not going to be shortened by large values of @xmath22 .    .",
    "a specific electron in the blob moves with some impact parameter , @xmath23 , in respect to the star , at the distance @xmath24 measured along the jet .",
    "electrons produce @xmath0-rays in the inverse compton process which can be farther absorbed in these same stellar radiation .",
    "secondary e@xmath25 pairs can interact with the stellar photons ( @xmath26 ) initiating the ic @xmath1 pair cascade.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    relativistic electrons in the blob can suffer strong energy losses on comptonization of radiation coming from a single star provided that the star is close to the direction of a moving blob .",
    "we assume that electrons are already injected into the blob with a power law spectrum . they are isotropic in the blob reference frame and the blob moves relativistically through the jet .",
    "the acceleration mechanism of electrons and their maximum energies are not specified in our model .",
    "they depend on the acceleration efficiency of electrons and of their dominant energy loss process .",
    "we assume that electrons can reach at least sub - tev energies which in the case of the acceleration process saturated by the synchrotron energy losses would require the magnetic field within the blob below several gauss ( see e.g. eq .  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "electrons with sub - tev energies in the relativistic blob can scatter the stellar radiation already quite deep in the klein - nishina ( kn ) regime .",
    "therefore , @xmath0-ray photons produced in the ic process can have energies comparable to energies of the primary electrons .",
    "these @xmath0-rays can be again absorbed in this same radiation field , initiating an ic @xmath1 pair cascade in the radiation of the luminous star .",
    "let us consider a single electron at a specific distance , @xmath24 , from the perpendicular plane containing the star and with the impact parameter @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",

    "the optical depth is inversely proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "the electrons can efficiently produce @xmath0-rays up to a distance @xmath34 cm . at the highest energies the optical depth",

    "[ fig2 ] shows the optical depth for the absorption of @xmath0-rays in the @xmath1 pair production process . for the assumed temperature of the star",
    "the peak of the pair production cross section falls around 100gev .",
    "large values of the optical depth lead to a strong absorption of such @xmath0 rays passing within the region of the inner few tens of stellar radii around the star .",
    "some photons might however undergo a few generations of an electromagnetic cascade and thus still be able to escape this region .     +    in fig .  [ fig3 ]",
    "we study the dependence of the observed emission on various parameters of the relativistic electrons .",
    "for simplicity we normalise the escaping @xmath0-ray emission to 1erg of energy injected in the blob ( measured in its frame ) .",
    "the emission is integrated over the whole range of the observation angles .",

    "for electrons passing close to the star , the @xmath0-ray absorption in the stellar radiation makes a clear imprint on the spectrum .",
    "interestingly , even while the optical depths for tev photons passing next to the star reach values @xmath35 , there is still a measurable flux of tev photons emitted for electrons passing that close to the star surface .",
    "it is a combined effect of the cascading process and the fact that the impact parameters of electrons are usually smaller than those of secondary @xmath0-rays . to explain the second effect ,",
    "let us consider a @xmath0 ray produced by an electron in a blob approaching a star ( @xmath36 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) at the distance @xmath24 . due to the anisotropy of the electron direction",
    "the @xmath0 ray is expected to be produced at an angle @xmath37 with respect to the blob movement direction .",
    "thus , the impact parameter of the @xmath0 ray , @xmath38 , might be much larger than the impact parameter of its parent electron , provided that the @xmath0 ray was emitted far from the star .",
    "moreover , if the optical depth is of the order of @xmath39 , the @xmath0-ray might still escape the production region with similar energy , undergoing a few generations of an electromagnetic cascade if the ic process occurs in kn regime ( compare the thin and thick red curve in the top left panel of fig .",

    "as long as the ic scattering on the stellar radiation is the dominant energy loss process for the electrons , the emission roughly scales with the radius of the blob cylinder .",

    "the star passing the inner jet at parsec distance from the smbh can be responsible for a sequence of outbursts as different blobs reach its position .",

    "in fact , a single blob may be also responsible for the observed sequence of flares ( e.g. as observed in mrk 421 , @xcite or pks2155 - 304 , @xcite ) , if it meets on its path a few stars within a jet .",
    "luminous stars are also characterised by stellar winds which pressure can balance the pressure of the blob plasma . as a result a shock structure appears around the star .",
    "the shock radius around the star in a conical jet can be determined from ( see e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath75 cm , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 km s@xmath4 are the mass loss rate and the velocity of the stellar wind , and @xmath78 erg s@xmath4 is the power of the blob in the observer s frame . since the surface area of this shock , @xmath79 , is typically much smaller than the surface area of the considered blob , the presence of the shock should not essentially influence presented above calculations of the @xmath0-ray emission from the blob .",
    "our model predicts the appearance of flares which emission is limited mostly to the @xmath0-ray energy range .",
    "therefore , it can provide the mechanism for the appearance of the so - called orphan @xmath0-ray flares observed occasionally from relatively nearby agns of the bl lac type ( e.g.   1es 1959 + 650 , @xcite or mrk 421 , @xcite ) but also from the fsrqs ( e.g. pks1222 + 21 , @xcite ) . in order to show applicability of this scenario we model the case of the emission from the very strong @xmath0-ray flare observed from the distant fsrq pks1222 + 21 in 2010 .",
    "our model is able to reproduce the observed light curve and spectral energy distribution measured by the _",
    "fermi_-lat and magic , although the energy requirements are quite demanding .",
    "note that in the case of blazars with orphan flares which are about an order of magnitude closer to the observer ( i.e. 1es 1959 + 650 and mrk 421 ) , this energy requirements should be about two orders of magnitude lower or the lorentz factors of the blob might be closer to values typically reported from radio observations .",
