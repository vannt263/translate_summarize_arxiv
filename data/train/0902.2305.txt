    "@xcite have proven to be ideal instruments for neutrino mass searches based on high - precision measurements of the tritium beta decay spectrum near the endpoint @xcite .",
    "the upcoming karlsruhe tritium neutrino experiment ( katrin ) @xcite aims at increasing the sensitivity on @xmath5 by an order of magnitude with respect to its predecessors .",
    "this requires an electron spectrometer with a resolving power of @xmath6 , corresponding to an energy resolution of @xmath7{ev}$ ] at the endpoint of the tritium beta spectrum ( @xmath8{kev}$ ] ) .",
    "calibration sources at these kev energies offering line widths of the order of or even below this resolution are necessary for different purposes :    for continuous monitoring of fluctuations of the retardation potential , an electron source with high stability both of the energy and the intensity is given by a nuclear / atomic standard using @xmath9{kev}$ ] conversion electrons from @xmath10kr @xcite .",
    "the k - shell conversion line exhibits a natural width of @xmath11{ev}$ ] @xcite , which is small enough to monitor the retardation potential , but too broad for detailed studies of the transmission properties of the mac - e filter .",
    "such a conversion electron source is presently being developed for katrin @xcite .",
    "however , in order to investigate the details of the transmission properties of the mac - e filter , an electron source in the kev range is needed , which can deliver fast - pulsed electrons with a sub - ev and well - defined energy spread and tunable beam intensities between single electrons and up to @xmath12 electrons per second .",
    "a pulsed electron source can serve as a means to test a particular `` time - of - flight '' operational mode of the mac - e filter that turns it from a high - pass into a band - pass filter and at the same time allows a more detailed and faster characterization of its transmission properties .",
    "this idea has been introduced in @xcite , where a first experimental study validating the concept is described .",
    "such a source requires a fast timing with pulse lengths @xmath13 both smaller than the time - of - flight of the electrons through the mac - e filter and smaller than the expected variation of the time - of - flight .",
    "a potentially suitable method to set up an electron source fulfilling the abovementioned requirements is to irradiate a cathode on high voltage with narrow - band uv light .",
    "this can be realized in a simple manner using modern deep - uv light emitting diodes ( leds ) .",
    "typical work functions @xmath14 of metals lie in the range of about @xmath15{ev}$ ] ( ag ) to @xmath16{ev}$ ] ( au ) , with @xmath17{ev}$ ] @xcite for stainless steel , corresponding to a wavelength of the light of @xmath18{nm}$ ] .",
    "standard laser technology can also be used to obtain output wavelengths in the deep - uv range . however , such ( high - power ) laser systems are rather expensive , immobile and require particular safety installations in the laboratory . by contrast ,",
    "light emitting diodes operating in the deep - uv domain are advantageous due to their versatility and ease of use , albeit offering only a fraction of the optical output power{nm}$ ] , an optical power output of @xmath19{\\mu w}$ ] for continuous operation and @xmath20{mw}$ ] in pulsed mode has been reported @xcite . ] as well as inferior spectral and beam profile characteristics compared to laser systems .",
    "certain fields of application , however , benefit from this feature of moderate and highly controllable output power combined with fast pulsing ( pulse length @xmath21{ns}$ ] , switching slopes of the order of a few ns , see for example references @xcite ) at repetition rates of @xmath22{khz}$ ] . in the particular application of photoelectron creation ,",
    "the drawback of line half - widths of the order of @xmath23{nm}$ ] typically obtained for such leds can partially be compensated by an appropriate matching of the work function @xmath14 of the photocathode material and the photon energy @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath14 and @xmath24 are chosen such that only photons from the high - energy part of the distribution can cause photoemission , the energy spread of the photoelectrons will be reduced accordingly .    in this article",
    "we will show that photoelectrons created with uv light from a pulsed led can be used to investigate the transmission function of electrostatic electron spectrometers and to perform time - of - flight measurements .",
    "the article is structured as follows : section [ sec : setup ] contains an overview of the setup and equipment used for our measurements , focusing on the photoelectron source and the retardation spectrometer . in section [ sec : photoelectrons ] we demonstrate the use of short uv light pulses to obtain tunable photoelectron rates . to determine the angular emission and the energy width of the photoelectron source",

    "this results in an expansion of the magnetic flux tube , visualized in figure  [ fig : experimental - setup ] by a widening of the magnetic field lines .",
    "electrons starting from a source in a higher magnetic field will spiral around the magnetic field lines .",
    "as the magnetic field strength continuously decreases towards the center of the spectrometer , the cyclotron component @xmath56 of the kinetic energy will be reduced and transformed into longitudinal kinetic energy @xmath57 according to the relation @xmath58 stating that , in the adiabatic limit , _",

    "the energy resolution @xmath63 of the mac - e filter thus follows directly from equation  ( [ equ : magn - moment ] ) by assuming that an electron starts at @xmath53 with a kinetic energy @xmath64 that resides entirely in the cyclotron component . in this case",

    "electrons are detected at the energy @xmath90 corresponding to the potential supplied to the photocathode , and at various multiples of this energy , @xmath91 .",

    "[ fig : seratio ] it can be verified that for the shortest pulse widths all emitted electrons come as single electrons , albeit at a small rate .",

    "as mentioned above , a time - of - flight measurement requires the energy spread of the photoelectrons to be sufficiently narrow . in order to verify this",
    "experimentally the photoelectron spectrum was measured using the mac - e filter .",
    "the 265 nm led was used for this measurement . by varying the retardation potential @xmath60 at fixed photocathode potential @xmath93 , several spectra of the photoelectron energy were recorded . for each measurement point",
    "the detected photoelectron count rate was determined by weighting the counts of each electron peak in the energy spectrum according to its multiplicity @xmath85 .",
    "figure [ fig : energyspectrum ] shows the total photoelectron count rate as a function of the surplus energy @xmath94 above the filter threshold .",
    "the width of this spectrum is compared with the nominal energy resolution of @xmath95{ev}$ ] of the mac - e filter , which is defined for a monoenergetic electron source filling the full forward solid angle .",
    "the experimentally observed width may differ due to two main contributions :    * the observed width is smaller , since the electrons do not fill the full forward solid angle : if the angular distribution at the point of highest magnetic field @xmath53 , _ i.e. _ , in the first superconducting magnet , would fill the full forward solid angle ( _ e.g. _ for an isotropically emitting radioactive source ) , then the residual cyclotron energy in the analyzing plane ( and thus the non - analyzable fraction of the energy ) would be @xmath95{ev}$ ] , which is defined as the nominal resolution of the mac - e filter .",
    "however , in our case , we do not expect that the angular distribution in the high magnetic field is filling the full forward solid angle since the photoelectrons emitted at the photocathode are immediately accelerated by the applied potential of @xmath0{kv}$ ] along the e - field axis , and the b - field is nearly collinear with the e - field .",
    "anyway , in the adiabatic case the cyclotron motion of the electron around a magnetic field line averages out any transverse electrical field .",
    "therefore , no transverse energy is picked up and the maximum angle is of order @xmath96{ev}}{\\unit[18]{kev } } } \\right)=    \\unit[0.3]{^\\circ}$ ] , assuming a maximum initial transversal energy of order @xmath69{ev}$ ] . due to the transformation of parallel into transverse energy according to equation  ( [ equ : magn - moment ] ) when going from @xmath97{t}$ ] at the location of the photoelectron source to the high field of @xmath67{t}$ ] in the magnet this angle corresponds to a maximum angle in the high field of @xmath98{^\\circ}$ ] , which is far from the full forward solid angle case .",
    "* the observed width may be even larger than expected from the filled forward solid angle due to an energy spread of the electrons . in our case ,",
    "the photoelectrons obtain different energies due to the finite width of the photon energy ( @xmath99{ev}$ ] ) and the local inhomogeneity of the work function of the photocathode , a further broadening of the measured energy width may originate from potential energy losses of the electrons inside the photocathode and the ripple of the high - voltage power supplies ( @xmath100{mv})$ ] ) .",
    "these two contributions to the width will result in different shapes of the energy spectrum .",
    "calculations of the energy spectrum for two cases are also shown in figure  [ fig : energyspectrum ] : the dashed line illustrates the transmission function of a mac - e filter for an isotropically emitting but monoenergetic electron source .",
    "the full line shows the expected transmission function for a single angle electron source with emission along the normal of the photocathode ( @xmath101{^\\circ}$ ] ) having an initial energy spread of the photoelectrons described by a gaussian broadening with @xmath102{ev}$ ] .",
    "the latter curve fits much better to the data .    although the small number of our data points and their limited statistics do not allow to really deconvolve the energy distribution of our photoelectron source",
    ", we can state that our data are well described by assuming that the photoelectrons are created with an energy spread of just @xmath103{ev}$ ] and that their momentum vector is nearly parallel to the magnetic field lines after acceleration .",
    "fitting these assumptions ( gaussian energy distribution and no angular spread ) to the data yields a fit error for the gaussian spread of @xmath104{ev}$ ]    this small energy spread and narrow angular distribution of the photoelectrons , together with pulse lengths shorter than @xmath105{ns}$ ] and a fast data acquisition system with a time resolution of @xmath81{ns}$ ] for single electrons , allows us to perform a high - resolution determination of the time of flight for photoelectrons passing the mac - e filter at different surplus energies .",
    "expected time - of - flight values range between @xmath106{ns}$ ] for surplus energies of @xmath107{ev}$ ] to several microseconds at few ev .    to obtain this time - of - flight spectrum we analyzed the data taken for the scan of the energy spectrum of the photoelectrons with respect to the arrival time distributions of the electrons .",
    "the start signal for the measurement of arrival times was provided by the trigger output of the function generator powering the uv led .",
    "this control signal was recorded on the second channel of the flash - adc card . the stop time was given by the time of an electron signal from the detector preamplifier recorded in the first channel of the flash - adc .",
    "figure [ fig : tof - measurement ] presents the time - of - flight spectrum for photoelectrons over a wide range of surplus energies above the filter potential using the mean time of flight for each surplus energy .",
    "electrons with large surplus energies @xmath108 reach the detector about @xmath109{ns}$ ] after the uv light pulse irradiated the photocathode , whereas electrons with small energies of @xmath110 arrive after about @xmath88{\\mu s}$ ] .",
    "the measurement is described well by a calculation based on    @xmath111    here we assumed that the velocity of the electron is parallel to the magnetic field lines and thus defined by the gain of the kinetic energy @xmath64 in the electric potential @xmath112 .",
    "this corresponds to the expectation discussed above that the photoelectrons are emitted with a negligible amount of transversal energy from the photocathode and accelerated by an electric field parallel to the magnetic field lines .    due to the broadening of the initial photoelectron energy distribution",
    "this calculation deviates from the measurement for small excess energies . when taking the broadening into account by folding equation  ( [ equ : tof - integration ] ) with a gaussian energy distribution the calculation also agrees with the measurement at small excess energies ( figure  [ fig : tof - measurement - b ] ) .",
    "the best agreement is achieved for a gaussian width of @xmath113{ev}$ ] , which matches well the gaussian width extracted from the integral energy spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : width - arrivaltimes ] shows the spread of the arrival time distributions for a given surplus energy .",
    "the increase of the width of the distributions at small excess energy again reflects the effect of the spread in initial photoelectron energy .",
    "these measurements show that with a photoelectron source based on uv light from a modern led irradiating a stainless steel cathode the time of flight of single electrons can be determined in mac - e filters .",
    "we have demonstrated that by using a deep - uv light emitting diode illuminating a stainless steel cathode photoelectrons , which are well - defined in energy and time , can be created with rates covering a large dynamical range .",
    "we accelerated these photoelectrons by an electric field to a typical energy of @xmath0{kev}$ ] .",
    "we determined the energy distribution of the photoelectrons in two ways , with both methods yielding consistent gaussian widths of about @xmath113{ev}$ ] .",
    "this value may probably be further improved by using a cathode material with a better defined work function ( _ e.g. _ a monocrystalline surface instead of stainless steel in a better vacuum ) .",
    "we achieved the time definition by electrically pulsing the uv led .",
    "pulse lengths from 40  @xmath1s down to 40  ns were applied , resulting in a corresponding definition of the photoelectron start time . to reach high total photoelectron rates we used pulse repetition rates of typically 1  khz . by choosing the operating parameters of the uv led like the operating voltage ( and thus the forward current ) , pulse width and pulse repetition rate we obtained photoelectron rates from several hz up to several 10  khz on average , with a maximum rate during the pulse of @xmath41{electrons/\\mu s}$ ] . in particular ,",
    "the operating parameters can be chosen such that only  or at least predominantly  single photoelectrons per pulse are achieved ( figure  [ fig : seratio ] ) , which allows to minimize the pile - up ratio and results in very good timing ( _ e.g. _ , for time - of - flight measurements ) .    at the mainz spectrometer ( an electrostatic retardation spectrometer of mac - e filter type ) we measured the transmitted electron rate as a function of the retardation energy ( integral mac - e filter mode ) , and the corresponding time - of - flight of the electrons ( non - integral mac - e - tof mode ) .",
    "we found that the observed integral as well as the time - of - flight spectrum agree well with the expectations considering an initial gaussian energy width of the photoelectrons of @xmath113{ev}$ ] ( compare figures  [ fig : energyspectrum ] and [ fig : tof - measurement - b ] ) .",
    "these investigations were performed especially in view of an application as a test source for the large mac - e filter of the katrin experiment ( see ref .",
    "the achieved line width , the small angular emittance as well as the obtained time - of - flight precision match well the requirements to determine precisely the local electric retarding potential over the @xmath114{m^2}$ ] large analyzing plane of the katrin main spectrometer by the onset of the transmission as well as to validate the correct evolution of the electric retarding potential along the electron trajectory by the time - of - flight method .    in a further development of this photoelectron source the additional feature of creating photoelectrons at well - defined transversal energy can be accomplished by choosing a suitable configuration of the electric and magnetic fields at the location of the photocathode . in the setup presented in this work magnetic and electric field",
    "were essentially parallel at the photocathode , resulting in electrons with negligible transversal energy .",
    "for different field configurations using a fast non - adiabatic acceleration in a strong electrical field transversal energies @xmath115 can be realized .",
    "such an electron source allows to probe the transmission properties of a mac - e filter in much more detail ( _ e.g. _ , in dependence of the transversal energy and the correctness of the adiabatic transformation according to equation  ( [ equ : magn - moment ] ) ) .",
    "we will report on first experimental studies with a proof of principle in a forthcoming publication @xcite . by combining fast pulsing with angular selectivity a powerful calibration tool for the katrin experiment and other applications",
