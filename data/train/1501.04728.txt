    "for a ( 111)-oriented snte or snse thick film four single , topologically protected dirac - cones in the four projections of the @xmath10-points onto the 2d bz ( one in @xmath15 point and three in the @xmath14 points ) are obtained in the calculations .",
    "this is similar to what we have obtained before for a ( 111)-oriented bulk pbsnte crystal  @xcite . for the anion - terminated surfaces ,",
    "the bands are brought to contact forming anion dirac cones , while in the other case the bands meet to form cation dirac cones . as shown already in ref .  ,",
    "all @xmath10 points belong to the three \\{110 } mirror planes of the ( 111)-surface and all dirac points should be thus topologically protected .",
    "this predictions have been also confirmed experimentally for ( pb , sn)se  @xcite as well as for snte  @xcite case . while at the @xmath15 point the dirac - cone is isotropic , the band structure around @xmath14 is strongly anisotropic , i.e. , depends differently on the @xmath16 values along the @xmath14 - @xmath15 and @xmath14 - @xmath17 directions .",
    "this is due to different orientations of the constant energy ellipsoids around different @xmath10 points : the @xmath18 ellipsoid is projected on @xmath15 along its long axis , whereas the ellipsoids for the other three @xmath10 points are inclined away from the projection direction .",
    "when the thickness of such tci film decreases the gaps in the dirac cones open , since the wave functions of the top and bottom surface states start to hybridize with each other .",
    "examples of band structures around @xmath15 and around @xmath14 points in the 2d bz of ( 111)-oriented snte(snse ) thin films are presented in fig .",
    "s1 ( fig .",
    "s2 ) in the supplement . in supplementary section",
    "i the calculation method together with the obtained tight - binding parameters is also presented . here in fig .",
    "[ fig : odd - gap - vs - thickness ] we present the 2d state energy gaps in ultrathin cation - terminated ( 111)-oriented snte ( a ) and snse ( b ) slabs as a function of the number ( odd ) of monolayers in the film .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : odd - gap - vs - thickness ] , in snte films the energy gap at the @xmath14 point decreases monotonically with the increase of the film thickness . at the @xmath15 point , however , damped oscillations of the energy gap with the number of monolayers can be observed .",
    "according to these results the first and biggest band gap inversion can be expected for snte films @xmath1 3 - 6 nm thick , i.e. , consisting of 17 - 33 monolayers .",
    "in contrast , in snse thin films energy gap at @xmath15 decreases monotonically , while the one at the @xmath14 point oscillates with the thickness of the film - in this case the first band gap inversion in @xmath14 should occur for films with 19 - 39 monolayers , what corresponds to similar thicknesses of 3.3 - 6.7 nm .",
    "analogous results are obtained for the anion - terminated layers . in this case , however , due to the smaller range of anion wave functions the inverted band gap starts to occur for slightly thinner layers ( 2.4 - 5.3 nm for snte and 2.6 - 5.7 nm for snse ) , as shown in the supplementary section ii .",
    "the damped oscillations of the band gap result from the @xmath19 corrections to the dirac - like hamiltonian of massive electron and have been already predicted for thin films of 3d tis , like bi@xmath8se@xmath20 or bi@xmath8te@xmath20  @xcite . in snte and snse @xmath19 terms",
    "are highly anisotropic .",
    "the differences in the results obtained for films of these materials stem from the fact that in snte the @xmath19 term moves the energy gap from @xmath10 towards the @xmath21 point , whereas in snse towards the @xmath22 point ( see fig .",
    "s3 in the supplement ) .    in analogy to results obtained in ref .",
    "for ( 001)-oriented pb@xmath7sn@xmath12te  layers , the described above changes of the energy gaps are associated with a topological phase transition .",
    "our calculations show , however , that in the case of ( 111)-oriented snte and snse layers the topological phase changes from trivial insulator not to tci , but to the 2d ti .",
    "the effect is similar to the transition to 2d ti predicted for bi@xmath8se@xmath20 or bi@xmath8te@xmath20 thin films  @xcite .",
    "this result is obtained by calculations of the @xmath23 invariant @xmath24 , which in 2d distinguishes between the trivial and qsh phase . for systems with inversion symmetry ,",
    "i.e. , for films consisting of an odd number of monolayers , the parity of the occupied bands eigenstates at the four time - reversal momenta points in the bz ( one @xmath15 and three @xmath14 ) determines the @xmath23 invariants  @xcite . the green shadowed areas in fig .  [",

    "with the results of topological invariant calculations , shown above , dirac crossing of the edge states appears in the band gap at the @xmath15 projection for the 19-layers , but not for the 13-layers thick slab ( compare fig .",

    "the sign of the g@xmath36 - g@xmath37 difference corresponds to spin polarization of the edge states . as expected for the 2d ti in the qsh state , the obtained edge states are spin polarized and",
    "the spin polarizations in the two branches of the dirac cones are always opposite .",
    "these spin polarizations in all studied cases are about 80% , i.e. , the contribution of the dominant spin configuration surpasses ca 8 - 10 times the opposite spin orientation .",
    "unlike the case of an odd number of layers , for ( 111)-oriented slabs consisting of an even number of monolayers there is no inversion symmetry in the system and the energy gaps are moved from the time - reversal invariant points ( see figs  s1(b ) and s2(b ) in the supplementary section i ) .",
    "the gap inversion occurs now in two points related by the time reversal symmetry on two sides of each time reversal invariant @xmath16 point .",
    "it has been shown for inversion - asymmetric systems in general  @xcite that the gap closing can be accompanied by transition between the trivial insulator and the qsh phase when the gap inversion occurs in an odd number of such pairs . in snse films",
    "this takes place in three pairs in the vicinity of the three nonequivalent @xmath14 points while in snte in one pair around the @xmath15 point .",
    "our calculations show that indeed for a given range of thicknesses the topological phase transition to the ti phase can be expected in these ( 111)-oriented films .",
    "if there is no inversion symmetry in the system , the @xmath23 topological invariants can not be determined by the method utilizing the parity of the eigenfunctions , which we used for films with an odd number of monolayers . to calculate @xmath23 for such layers",
    "we have adopted the method proposed by fukai and hatsugai  @xcite . in this method",
    "the improvements to computing chern numbers in a lattice bz enable the tight - binding calculations of @xmath23 based on the formula derived by fu and kane in ref .  .",
    "the dependence of the band gap of snte ( 111)-oriented films consisting of an even number of monolayers on the layer thickness is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : even - gap - vs - thickness]a .",
    "the thicknesses for which the value @xmath25 has been obtained are marked by the green shadow .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : even - gap - vs - thickness]a the qsh phase can be expected in snte films consisting of 14 - 28 monolayers ( @xmath1 2.5 - 5.1 nm thick ) . for snse",
    "the qsh phase is obtained for 18 - 38 monolayers , i.e. , for film thicknesses in the range 3.1 - 6.6 nm . in the case of snte films with even number of layers the whole inverted energy gap for states in the vicinity of @xmath15",
    "is situated inside the large gap between conduction and valence bands close to the @xmath14 point , as one can clearly see in fig .",
    "[ fig : even - gap - vs - thickness]b .",
    "the largest value of the inverted gap , about 75 mev , is obtained for the 18 - 20 monolayers thick snte slab .",
    "the calculated spectral functions along the [ @xmath26 edge for the ( 111)-oriented , 18-monolayers thick snte film show a clear dirac node in the center of the band gap at the @xmath28 point .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : edge - even - snte]a .",
    "the obtained results are in full agreement with the formalism developed in ref .  .",
    "we note that a similar result has been obtained for graphene  @xcite  in this case one observes a single edge state with a dirac node at @xmath15 ( time - reversal symmetry point ) , despite the energy gaps appear in two points @xmath38 ( in which the time - reversal is not preserved ) .",
    "[ fig : edge - even - snse ] presents the edge spectral functions at the projections of @xmath14 points at ( a ) @xmath28 and ( b ) @xmath34 point , calculated for the 20-monolayers thick snse slab .",
    "as shown in the supplementary material , in this case the band gap at the @xmath28 is very small .",
    "still , a pair of edge states can be seen near the top of the valence band .",
    "the spin polarization of this edge state is shown in fig .  [ fig : edge - even - snse]c . at the @xmath34 point , however , the edge states which form the two dirac cones do not crossover the band gap to connect the valence and conduction bands . instead , the upper and lower edge states repel each other and two anticrossings appear ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : edge - even - snse]b ) .",
    "interestingly , these edge states are still spin polarized , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : edge - even - snse]d .    the calculations presented above show that in the free standing ( 111)-oriented snse and snte thin films there exists a range of thicknesses for which the 2d ti phase appears .",
    "the qsh phase is obtained for all studied films , both with odd and also even number of monolayers .",
    "however , for all but the ( 111)-oriented snte films with an even number of monolayers an overlapping of bands in @xmath15 and @xmath14 diminishes the final band gap .",
    "hence , the edge states appear either against the background of the bands or within a very small energy gap ( see supplementary section ii ) .",
    "the ( 111)-oriented snte films with an even , close to 20 , number of monolayers is thus the best candidate for observing the qsh effect in the iv - vi tci .",
    "the qsh phase produced in this material system is highly robust , being even oblivious to the lack of inversion symmetry .",
    "the latter indicates that a suitable substrate or an overlayer will not destroy this 2d ti phase .",
    "quite the contrary , using carefully selected substrate or overlay material ( e.g. , pb@xmath7eu@xmath6se@xmath39te@xmath40 quaternary alloy ) would allow to tune the height of the energy barriers and biaxial strain in the structure  @xcite .",
    "as shown already in ref .   for snte ( 001 ) surface and for snte nanomembrane in ref .",
    ", the uniaxial or biaxial strain can be used for manipulating with the energy gaps in the surface ( or interface ) states .",
    "the strain can be also used for solving the mentioned above problem of band overlapping , which diminishes the resulting energy gap ( as it was shown in ref .   for solving a similar obstacle in pbte/(pb , sn)te heterostructures ) .",
    "thus , these results may pave the road for experimental realization of qsh in snte and snse layers and their quantum well structures .",
