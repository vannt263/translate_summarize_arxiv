    "recently a new kind of unique decoding algorithm of algebraic geometry codes appeared @xcite .",
    "the algorithm decodes the primal ag code that consists of codewords obtained by evaluation of functions at rational points of an algebraic curve , unlike the classical syndrome decoding algorithm that decodes the dual code .",
    "based on grbner bases of modules over a univariate polynomial ring , the algorithm has a regular data and control structure that is suitable for parallel hardware implementation , like ktter s algorithm for the syndrome decoding @xcite .    in this paper , we reformulate the previous algorithm , using the theory of grbner bases of modules on the coordinate ring of the base curve .",
    "this approach eliminates the technical complexity of the previous algorithm in a large degree , and results in a conceptually clean description of the algorithm which would contribute for better understanding the majority voting procedure , which plays a central role in the interpolation - based unique decoding .",
    "the new algorithm resembles the berlekamp - massey - sakata algorithm for the syndrome decoding @xcite .",
    "in section [ mckwd ] , we review the theory of the grbner bases of modules over the coordinate rings of algebraic curves , and outline the interpolation decoding algorithm based on it .",
