    "diffraction gratings are widely used tools for astronomical applications , in both ground - based and space - borne telescope facilities .",
    "a proper implementation of gratings for spectroscopic observations requires a full understanding of their properties .",
    "however , apart from a few results following directly from the grating equation ( spectral dispersion , free spectral range , blaze wavelength ) , the derivation of other important characteristics of gratings is less straightforward . this is certainly the case for the determination of the angular / wavelength distribution of the diffracted intensity , which is needed for the estimation of the grating efficiency under specific illumination conditions , and for given diffraction orders and directions .",
    "a reliable estimate of the grating efficiency is critical in the design of spectroscopic tools to be employed for observations that are particularly demanding on the photon flux reaching the detector .",
    "a typical example is that of high - sensitivity spectro - polarimetry , which is a fundamental diagnostic tool for the inference of magnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas",
    ".    a correct determination of the grating intensity distribution must take into account the polarization properties of gratings , and can only be attained within a full ( vector ) electro - magnetic theory of diffraction .",
    "however , the simpler scalar theory is often very useful , being capable of providing a good approximation to the average ( i.e. , unpolarized ) efficiency , which can be adopted for reliable flux - budget estimations in spectrographic instruments .",
    "this is particularly true for small blaze angles , and for small ratios of the wavelength to the grating period @xcite .",
    "echelle gratings with steeper blaze angles ( e.g. , of the r2 type , which is commonly adopted in high spectral resolution instrument setups for the remote sensing of astrophysical plasmas ) , working in relatively low orders , typically display strong polarization features and anomalies .",
    "however , special reflective coating techniques such as `` shadow casting '' @xcite have been demonstrated to effectively reduce these anomalies to such a level that the scalar theory of diffraction becomes again useful also for the modeling of the efficiency of this type of gratings .    in the case of transmission gratings ,",
    "the expression for the intensity distribution of the diffracted radiation is well - known @xcite , and it depends in a fundamental way on the grating period , @xmath0 , and the width of the transmitting aperture , @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , the commonly used extension of that formula to blazed reflective gratings appears to be marred by a confused identification of the width @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this misuse of the intensity distribution function typically results in grossly overestimated or underestimated efficiencies for echelle gratings , ultimately affecting the reliability of the design of spectrographic instruments .",
    "@xcite provides the correct identification of the @xmath1 parameter for blazed reflective gratings under different illumination conditions , although without formal derivation .     geometric construction for the derivation of the grating efficiency formula .",
    "the grating shown in the figure has ruling step @xmath0 and blaze angle @xmath2 , with the two facets forming a right angle ( in @xmath3 ) .",
    "@xmath4 is the angle of incidence of the incoming light ( @xmath5 ) measured from the normal @xmath6 of the grating , while @xmath7 gives the direction of the diffracted light ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "@xmath9 is the normal to the illuminated facet , so that @xmath10 . ]    in section  [ sec : theory ] , we derive from first principles the scalar intensity distribution function of a blazed reflective grating , for the most common case of a groove profile with rectangular apex . comparing our result with the commonly adopted expression for this intensity distribution , we attain a clear identification of the geometric parameters involved .",
    "this derivation of the intensity distribution function for a blazed reflective grating is validated by the results of numerical modeling based on a vector theory of diffraction from one - dimensional diffraction gratings , which are presented in section  [ sec : discussion ] , as well as from laboratory measurements ( h.  lin , private communication ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : grating ] shows the geometric construction for a reflective diffraction grating with a blaze angle @xmath2 and ruling period @xmath0 . for simplicity , we assume the most common case of a grating profile with rectangular apex . conventionally , we indicate with @xmath4 the incidence angle of the incoming radiation ( @xmath5 ) with respect to the grating normal @xmath6 , and with @xmath7 the corresponding angle for the diffracted radiation ( @xmath8 ) . in the following derivation",
    "we assume the condition @xmath11 , which ensures that the secondary facet is never illuminated ( and therefore does not contribute to the diffracted energy ) .",
    "the case @xmath12 will be discussed briefly at the end , in the context of _",
    "shadowing_.    following @xcite , the distribution of the diffracted intensity by a grating , according to the scalar theory of diffraction , can be obtained from the fourier transform of the grating transmission ( or aperture ) function , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the coordinate along the grating plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : grating ] ) .",
    "this transmission function is different from zero only in correspondence of the _ openings _ of the grating , i.e. , the regions of the @xmath14-axis from where the diffracted radiation appears to emanate .",
    "these openings are the analog of the transmitting apertures in a transmission grating . for a blazed reflective grating , such as the one pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : grating ] , we see that these openings correspond to the segment @xmath15 and periodic replicas of it along the grating length .",

    "this is the ordinary condition of reflection on the grating facets ( _ blaze condition _ ) .    for values of @xmath14 intermediate between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the phase difference between the diffracted ray through @xmath14 and the one through @xmath31 scales with the factor @xmath32 which therefore must be introduced into eq .",
    "( [ eq : phase_tp ] ) , as a multiplicative scaling factor of @xmath20 , in order to calculate the dephasing of the diffracted beam introduced by the blaze .",
    "the derivation given above allows the computation of the phase dependence of an arbitrary diffracted ray through the segment @xmath15 for the groove that was conventionally set as the origin .",
    "each successive groove introduces an offset of the phase retardance that is constant throughout the grating ( i.e. , independent of @xmath14 ) , and which is determined by the additional travel of the plane wave over the path @xmath33 . the segment",
    "@xmath34 has already been determined , whereas @xmath35 since @xmath36 , we also have @xmath37 where @xmath38 has also been determined earlier . the phase retardance introduced by each groove",
