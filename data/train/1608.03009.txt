    "the dynamics of the action of an element of @xmath1 plays a key role in the nielsen - thurston theory for surface homeomorphisms",
    ". it also plays a crucial role in the variation of mcshane s identity for punctured surface bundles with pseudo - anosov monodromy , established by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask what does the action of the whole group @xmath2 ( or its subgroups ) look like .",
    "however , the authors could not find a reference which treats this natural question , though there are various references which study the action of ( subgroups of ) the mapping class groups on the projective measured lamination spaces , which are homeomorphic to higher dimensional spheres ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , such an action is minimal ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and moreover ergodic @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to prove that the action of @xmath2 on @xmath1 is almost everywhere  wandering ( see theorem [ b1 ] for the precise meaning ) .",

    "let @xmath6 be the space of complete geodesic rays in @xmath7 emanating from the puncture .",
    "then @xmath1 is identified with a horocycle , @xmath8 , in the cusp .",
    "in fact , a point of @xmath9 determines a geodesic ray in @xmath7 emanating from the puncture , or more precisely , a bi - infinite geodesic path with its positive end going out the cusp and meeting @xmath9 in the given point . any mapping class @xmath10 of @xmath7 maps each geodesic ray to another path which can be straightened out  to another geodesic ray , and hence determines another point of @xmath9 .",
    "this gives an action of the infinite cyclic group generated by @xmath11 on @xmath12 .",
    "a rigorous construction of this action is described as follows .",

    "let @xmath18 be the closure in @xmath16 of a lift of @xmath19 to @xmath15 .",

    "thus , we obtain an action of @xmath11 on @xmath6 , by setting @xmath22 .",
    "the dynamics of this action plays a key role in @xcite .",
    "however , one needs to verify that this action does not depend on the choice of a representative @xmath13 of @xmath11 .    in the following ,",
    "we settle this issue , by using the canonical boundary of a relatively hyperbolic group described in @xcite .",
    "though we are really interested here only in the case where the group is the fundamental group of a once - punctured closed orientable surface , and the the peripheral structure is interpreted in the usual way ( as the conjugacy class of the fundamental group of a neighborhood of the puncture ) , we give a discussion in a general setting .",
    "let @xmath23 be a non - elementary relatively hyperbolic group with a given peripheral structure @xmath24 , which is a conjugacy invariant collection of infinite subgroups of @xmath23 . by ( * ?",
    "* definition 1 ) , @xmath23 admits a properly discontinuous isometric action on a path - metric space , @xmath25 , with the following properties .    1 .",
    "@xmath25 is proper ( i.e. , complete and locally compact ) and gromov hyperbolic , 2 .   every point of the boundary of @xmath25 is either a conical limit point or a bounded parabolic point , 3 .",
    "the peripheral subgroups , i.e. , the elements of @xmath24 , are precisely the maximal parabolic subgroups of @xmath23 , and 4 .   every peripheral subgroup is finitely generated .",
    "it is proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 9.4 ) that the gromov boundary @xmath26 is uniquely determined by @xmath27 , ( even though the quasi - isometry class of the space @xmath25 satisfying the above conditions is not uniquely determined ) .",
    "thus the boundary @xmath28 is defined to be @xmath26 . by identifying @xmath23 with an orbit in @xmath25",
    ", we obtain a natural topology on the disjoint union @xmath29 which is compact hausdorff , with @xmath23 discrete and @xmath30 closed .",
    "the action of @xmath23 on itself by left multiplication extends to an action on @xmath29 by homeomorphism .",
    "this gives us a geometrically finite convergence action of @xmath23 on @xmath30 .",

    "this contains the inner automorphism group , @xmath33 .",
    "now , by the naturality of @xmath34 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 9.4 ) ) , the action of @xmath31 on @xmath23 also extends to an action on @xmath29 , which is @xmath23-equivariant , i.e. , @xmath35 for every @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "( in order to avoid confusion , we use @xmath39 to denote group actions , only in this place . ) under the natural epimorphism @xmath40 , this gives rise to the same action on @xmath41 as that induced by left multiplication .",
    "the centre of @xmath23 is always finite , and for simplicity , we assume it to be trivial . in this case , we can identify @xmath23 with @xmath33 .",
    "suppose that @xmath42 is a parabolic point .",
    "its stabiliser , @xmath43 , in @xmath23 is a peripheral subgroup .",
    "now @xmath44 acts properly discontinuously cocompactly on @xmath45 , so the quotient @xmath46 is compact hausdorff ( cf .",
    "* section 6 ) ) .",
    "let @xmath47 be the stabiliser of @xmath48 in @xmath31 .",
    "then @xmath44 is a normal subgroup of @xmath49 , and we get an action of @xmath50 on @xmath51 .",
    "if there is only one conjugacy class of peripheral subgroups , then the orbit @xmath52 is @xmath31-invariant , and it follows that the group @xmath49 maps isomorphically onto @xmath53 , so in this case we can naturally identify the group @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath7 is a once - punctured closed orientable surface , with negative euler characteristic @xmath56 .",
    "we write @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , the universal cover , and @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the peripheral structure of @xmath23 arising from the cusp of @xmath7 , namely @xmath24 consists of the conjugacy class of the fundamental group of a neighbourhood of the end of @xmath7 .",
    "then @xmath60 is a relatively hyperbolic group , because if we fix a complete hyperbolic structure on @xmath7 then @xmath61 is identified with @xmath15 and the isometric action of @xmath23 on @xmath62 satisfies the conditions ( 1)(4 ) in the above , namely ( * ? ? ? * definition 1 ) .",
    "now @xmath61 admits a natural compactification to a closed disc , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the dynamically defined circle at infinity .",
    "we can identify @xmath64 with @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath65 is any point of @xmath61 , then identifying @xmath23 with the orbit @xmath66 , we get an identification of @xmath29 with @xmath67 . as above",
    "we get an action of @xmath31 on @xmath64 . if @xmath68 is parabolic , then its stabiliser @xmath44 in @xmath23 is isomorphic to the infinite cyclic group @xmath69 , and we get an action of @xmath55 on the circle @xmath70 . since @xmath55 is identified with the ( full ) mapping class group , @xmath71 , of @xmath7 , we obtain a well defined action of @xmath71 on the circle @xmath51 .",
    "we now return to the setting in the beginning of this section , where @xmath4 is endowed with a complete hyperbolic structure",
    ". then we can identify the ( dynamically defined ) circle @xmath72 with the horocycle , @xmath9 , in the cusp , which in turn is identified with the space of geodesic rays , @xmath6 .",
    "this gives an action of @xmath71 on @xmath6 . since the action of @xmath23 on @xmath15 satisfies the conditions ( 1)-(4 ) in the above ( i.e. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 1 ) ) , we see that , for each mapping class @xmath11 of @xmath7 , its action on @xmath6 , defined via the straightening process  presented at the beginning of this section , is identical with the action which is dynamically constructed in the above , independently from the hyperbolic structure .",
    "thus the problem raised at the beginning of this section is settled .",
    "in order to state the main result , we prepare some terminology .",
    "let @xmath73 be a group acting by homeomorphism on a topological space @xmath25 .",
    "an open subset , @xmath74 , is said to be _ wandering _ if @xmath75 for all @xmath76 .",
    "( note that this definition is stronger than the usual definition of wandering , where it is only assumed that the number of @xmath77 such that @xmath78 is finite . )",
    "the _ wandering domain _ , @xmath79 is the union of all wandering open sets .",
    "its complement , @xmath80 , is the _ non - wandering set_. this is a closed @xmath73-invariant subset of @xmath25 .",
    "note that if @xmath81 is a @xmath82-invariant open set , then @xmath83 .",
    "if @xmath84 is a normal subgroup , we get an induced action of @xmath85 on @xmath86 .",
    "( in practice , the action of @xmath87 on @xmath25 will be properly discontinuous . )",
    "one checks easily that @xmath88 with equality if @xmath89 .",
    "note that any hyperbolic structure on @xmath7 induces a euclidian metric on @xmath51 ( via the horocycle @xmath9 ) .",
    "if one changes the hyperbolic metric , the induced euclidian metrics on @xmath51 are related by a quasisymmetry .",
    "however , they are completely singular with respect to each other ( see @xcite ) .",
    "( that is , there is a set which has zero measure in one structure , but full measure in the other . ) in general , this gives little control over how the hausdorff dimension of a subset can change .",
    "we say that a subset , @xmath90 is _ small _ if it has hausdorff dimension stricty less than 1 with respect to any hyperbolic structure on @xmath7 .",
    "now we can state our main theorem .",
    "[ b1 ] let @xmath7 be a once - punctured closed orientable surface , with @xmath91 , and consider the action of @xmath71 on the circle @xmath51 , defined in the above .",
    "then the non - wandering set in @xmath51 with respect to the action of @xmath71 is small .",
    "in particular , the non - wandering set has measure 0 with respect to any hyperbolic structure , and so has empty interior .",
    "given that two different hyperbolic structures give rise to quasisymmetically related metrics on @xmath51 , it is natural to ask if there is a more natural way to express this .",
    "for example , is there a property of ( closed ) subsets of @xmath51 , invariant under quasisymmetry and satisfied by the non - wandering set , which implies hausdorff dimension less than 1 ( or measure 0 ) ?",
    "let @xmath4 be a complete finite - area orientable hyperbolic surface with precisely one cusp , where @xmath5 .",
