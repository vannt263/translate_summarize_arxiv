    "experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have been searching for the deconfined phase of nuclear matter and have begun to probe its properties  @xcite .",
    "there are strong indications that this new form of matter behaves like a nearly perfect fluid with high opacity and low viscosity , referred to as strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp )  @xcite .",
    "one of the major experimental findings is a large azimuthal anisotropy , @xmath4 , in transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) spectra of hadrons in non - central collisions  @xcite . to account for this observation ,",
    "hydrodynamic simulations require an early initialization time , implying a rapid thermalization of the bulk medium  @xcite .",
    "however , the microscopic origin of the rapid thermalization remains a matter of debate .",
    "in contrast to light partons making up the bulk of the medium , heavy quarks ( charm and bottom ) , produced in primordial hard collisions and acting as impurities in the qgp , are not expected to fully equilibrate with the surrounding medium . due to their large masses ( @xmath5 ) a memory of their interaction history",
    "may be preserved , thus providing a more direct probe of the medium properties than bulk observables  @xcite .",
    "the thermal relaxation time of heavy quarks has been argued to be larger than that of light quarks by a factor of @xmath6  @xcite ( @xmath0 : typical temperature of the qgp ) . as they diffuse through the medium ,",
    "heavy quarks interact with the light partons and their spectrum becomes quenched  @xcite .",
    "moreover , as they couple to the collective flow of the medium in non - central heavy - ion collisions , heavy quarks may develop substantial momentum anisotropies .",
    "these two effects are translated into equivalent behavior of heavy - flavor ( hf ) meson ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) spectra and @xmath4 , and further into the spectrum and @xmath4 of their decay electrons .",
    "the latter have been measured in au+au collisions at rhic  @xcite , exhibiting appreciable modifications over their baseline spectra from @xmath7 and @xmath8au collisions .",
    "model calculations based on radiative energy loss in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , which could account for the observed jet - quenching in the light sector  @xcite , predicted a much smaller quenching for heavy quarks and associated single - electron spectra  @xcite .",
    "the large hq mass suppresses small - angle gluon radiation (  dead cone \" effect  @xcite ) and reduces the gluon formation time  @xcite , hence mitigating radiative energy loss significantly .",
    "however , elastic collisions of heavy quarks with light partons  @xcite have been argued to dominate over radiative scattering at low momentum , resulting in notable quenching of the hq spectrum .",
    "however , jet quenching only captures part of the physics potential of the hq probe .",
    "its diffusion properties , which reach all the way to zero momentum , include energy - gain processes which are , e.g. , instrumental for the coupling to the collective flow of the medium .",
    "several studies of hq diffusion have been conducted in recent years using fokker - planck  @xcite and boltzmann transport  @xcite approaches , mostly implementing elastic collisions as the microscopic dynamics .",
    "they differ not only in their treatment of the background medium , but also in the evaluation of ( a ) the transport coefficients emerging from the interactions between the heavy quarks and the medium , and ( b ) hadronization of heavy quarks into hf mesons . concerning item ( a )",
    ", most studies employ variants of the pqcd interaction  @xcite , while a novel approach with heavy - light resonant interactions was introduced in refs .  @xcite .",
    "the latter was found to be a factor of 3 - 4 more efficient in hq thermalization than pqcd , and was subsequently corroborated by microscopic @xmath0-matrix calculations using input potentials from lattice qcd ( lqcd )  @xcite . concerning hq hadronization , several studies focused on independent fragmentation  @xcite , which is not reliable in the low and intermediate-@xmath1 regimes . here",
    ", light partons surrounding the heavy quark have a high phase - space density which renders coalescence a more plausible hadronization mechanism  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , heavy - light quark recombination has been incorporated utilizing an instantaneous coalescence model  @xcite which could still be problematic at low @xmath1 due to lack of energy conservation .",
    "a reliable treatment of the low-@xmath1 regime is important since the total number of heavy quarks is expected to be conserved through the hadronization transition .",
    "if the @xmath2- or @xmath3-meson spectra are distorted at low @xmath1 , the spectra at higher @xmath1 are necessarily affected thus modifying the @xmath9 ( and @xmath4 ) of @xmath2 and @xmath3-mesons and their decay electrons .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to establish a realistic and quantitative framework for hq probes within ( a ) a strongly coupled qgp background medium ( modeled by hydrodynamics ) , ( b ) a non - perturbative scenario of elastic diffusion in the qgp simulated by fokker - planck - langevin dynamics , and ( c ) a hadronization scheme at the phase transition based on the same interaction as in ( b ) , combining recombination and fragmentation consistent with the limiting cases of kinetic equilibrium and vacuum hadronization . unlike previous studies utilizing weak - coupling diffusion  @xcite we try to implement the hq probe consistently within a framework of strong coupling between heavy and light quarks , both in the qgp and during hadronization .",
    "our comprehensive framework is hence conceptually compatible with the notion of a strongly interacting qgp .",
    "the strategy in this work is as follows .",
    "for the hq transport coefficient we employ a non - perturbative @xmath0-matrix calculation of heavy - light quark interactions  @xcite .",
    "this calculation supports feshbach resonances in the qgp in the color - singlet and anti - triplet channels , surviving as rather broad states up to @xmath10 .",
    "they are responsible for the enhancement of the transport coefficient compared to pqcd scattering . with these coefficients",
    "we perform langevin simulations of hq diffusion through an expanding medium which is described by ideal 2 + 1-dimensional hydrodynamics ( using the azhydro code  @xcite at rhic energies ) . at the phase transition",
    ", heavy quarks are hadronized through coalescence with light quarks of the medium using the resonance recombination model ( rrm )  @xcite implemented on a hypersurface given by the hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "the coalescence probability is evaluated using the resonant scattering rate of the heavy quark with light ( anti ) quarks , supplemented by independent fragmentation .",
    "the rrm formalism is consistent with the heavy - light feshbach resonance formation found in the @xmath0-matrix used for the transport coefficient .",
    "this stipulates the role played by the resonance correlations in our work . with an artificially large transport coefficient",
    ", we check the equilibrium limit of the hq distribution emanating from the combined hydro+langevin simulation and the ensuing degree of equilibration of the hf mesons upon resonance recombination .",
    "the full space - momentum correlations generated by the hydro - langevin simulation enter into resonance recombination .",
    "this enables a quantitative assessment of the radial medium flow on hf meson spectra at low @xmath1 as imprinted on the final @xmath9 measurement .",
    "our article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_langevin ] we introduce the ingredients for the hydro - langevin simulation of hq diffusion in the medium , i.e. , the transport coefficient , the initial distribution in coordinate and momentum space , and the background medium described by an ideal hydrodynamic model . numerical results for the hq @xmath9 and @xmath4 are discussed in the equilibrium limit as well as for realistic coefficients .",

    "[ summary ] we summarize and conclude .",
    "the thermal momentum of a heavy quark at temperatures characteristic for heavy - ion collisions at rhic amounts to @xmath11 , which is parametrically larger than the typical momentum transfer , @xmath12 , in a single elastic collision with a light parton from the bulk medium .",
    "therefore many collisions are needed to change the hq momentum considerably  @xcite .",
    "this forms the basis for approximating the hq motion in the qgp by a succession of uncorrelated momentum kicks and leads to a fokker - planck approach realized stochastically by the langevin equations  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the position and momentum vector of the heavy quark , and @xmath16 is its energy . in the following",
    "we employ the post - point discretization scheme in which the equilibrium condition ( the relativistic fluctuation - dissipation theorem ) takes the simple form @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the drag coefficient and @xmath19 the ( diagonal ) diffusion coefficient .",
    "the standard gaussian noise variable , @xmath20 , is distributed according to @xmath21 neither the original fokker - planck equation  @xcite nor the langevin equation is lorentz covariant .",
    "we choose the momentum and position updates for our hq test particles to be at equidistant time steps @xmath22 in the lab frame . for a flowing medium , as in our context , the momentum updates are rather to be done in the fluid rest frame . the updated 4-momentum is boosted back to the lab frame with the fluid four - velocity @xmath23 .",
    "the aforementioned equilibrium condition must be satisfied in order for the long - time limit of the test particle distribution to converge to the equilibrium ( boltzmann - jttner ) distribution as defined by the underlying background medium .",
    "further details of our algorithm will be detailed in a forthcoming article  @xcite .",

    ", we predict that the degree of charm - quark thermalization is large enough to develop a characteristic  flow - bump \" in the @xmath2-meson nuclear modification factor .",
    "the proper equilibrium limit of the underlying coalescence mechanism is essential in developing this feature , while its location in @xmath1 is sensitive to the strength of the medium flow . for @xmath38-quarks the coupling to the medium",
    "is not strong enough for this feature to emerge .",
    "we have further decayed our @xmath2- and @xmath3-meson spectra semi - leptonically ; the corresponding single - electron spectra show an encouraging agreement with current rhic data for @xmath162gev ; the nuclear modification factor reiterates the importance of a realistic flow strength , while the elliptic flow is a more sensitive gauge for the magnitude of the hq transport coefficient .",
    "our current estimate confirms earlier results for the spatial diffusion constant in the vicinity of 5/(2@xmath163 ) .",
    "several uncertainties and areas of improvement remain , e.g. , ( i ) a more complete evaluation of hq relaxation rates by including non - perturbative effects in elastic scattering off gluons , as well as adding radiative processes ( expected to become relevant at high @xmath45 ) ; ( ii ) hadronic diffusion , especially in light of recent estimates indicating comparable strength of hf transport in the hadronic and qgp phases near @xmath30  @xcite ; ( iii ) a more complete hadro - chemistry at @xmath30 including strange @xmath2-mesons and charmed baryons ; ( iv ) a possible cronin effect in the initial hq spectra , which mostly affects @xmath9 ; ( v ) further improvements in the medium evolution , i.e. , a hydrodynamic background with harder spectra ( e.g. , due to viscosity , initial flow or a harder eos ) .",
    "the framework put forth in this paper allows us to systematically address all of these items .",
    "this will not only be beneficial for the open heavy - flavor sector ( and an ultimate determination of the qgp s viscosity ) but also for its impact on closely related observables such as heavy quarkonia and intermediate - mass dileptons .",

    "<S> the heavy - quark transport coefficients in the medium are obtained from non - perturbative @xmath0-matrix interactions which build up resonant correlations close to the transition temperature . </S>",

    "<S> the pertinent resonance recombination satisfies energy conservation and provides an equilibrium mapping between quark and meson distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the recombination probability is derived from the resonant heavy - quark scattering rate . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , recombination dominates at low transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) and yields to fragmentation at high @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our approach thus emphasizes the role of resonance correlations in the diffusion and hadronization processes . </S>",
