    "geometric phases have been proposed as a typical mechanism for a quantum system to keep the memory of its evolution in hilbert space .",
    "such phases were introduced in quantum mechanics by berry in 1984  @xcite .",
    "soon after berry s work , geometric phases became objects of intense theoretical and experimental research  @xcite , whence it was noticed that they are related to a number of important phenomena in physics  @xcite , such as aharonov - bohm  @xcite and quantum hall  @xcite effects . in recent years",
    ", this interest has also increased due to their applicability in quantum - information processing  @xcite .    in his seminal work",
    ", berry considered an arbitrary system governed by a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 denotes a set of parameters ( e.g. , a three - dimensional magnetic field ) .",
    "it was then shown that , if the system is prepared in a non - degenerate eigenstate of the initial hamiltonian @xmath3 $ ] and is kept on adiabatic cyclic evolution in parameter space , then it will return to its initial state accompanied by a phase factor that can be split into a dynamic contribution , which depends both on energy and evolution time , and a geometric contribution , which exclusively depends on the path traversed by the system in parameter space .",
    "berry phases were generalized in several contexts .",
    "wilczek and zee considered systems under cyclic and adiabatic evolution dictated by hamiltonians with degenerate spectra , which results in non - abelian ( non - commutative ) geometric phases  @xcite .",
    "aharonov and anandan treated abelian phases under cyclic but _ non - adiabatic _",
    "evolution  @xcite , which were then extended by anandan for the non - abelian case  @xcite .",
    "moreover , formulations of _ noncyclic _ geometric phases were proposed by samuel and bhandari  @xcite and by mukunda and simon  @xcite .",
    "extensions for mixed states under unitary  @xcite and non - unitary  @xcite evolutions have also been considered due to their importance in decohering systems .",
    "recently , the interface between geometric phases and quantum - information theory has been attracting renewed attention , with focus on investigating of the effect of entanglement on the behavior of geometric phases in composite systems  @xcite .",
    "in particular , consider a composite quantum state evolving in time by local unitary transformations .",
    "then , the available entanglement is naturally kept fixed for the state . for such evolution ,",
    "the total dynamic phase for the composite state can be split as the sum of the dynamic phases for the subsystems .",
    "in contrast , this does not hold for the geometric phase unless the state is separable  @xcite .",
    "in other words , entangled states acquire a correction term in the geometric phase for the composite system with respect to the sum of geometric phases for each subsystem .",
    "this correction arises from the ( classical and quantum ) correlations among the parts of the entangled state .    in this context",
    ", the aim of this work is to discuss the relationship between geometric phases and entanglement in a composite quantum system in the presence of _ interaction _ among the parts of the system . in this case",
    ", we have that the evolution will be given by nonlocal unitary transformations ( nonfactorizable in the tensor product of individual transformations ) .",
    "in particular , if a system is prepared in a separable initial state , the interaction may induce the appearance of entanglement during the state evolution",
    ". we will be interested in the role played by entanglement on the geometric phase acquired during the evolution in comparison with the geometric phase acquired by the system in the non - interacting limit .",
    "as we will show , for the case of heisenberg spin chains , the contribution of the exchange interaction to the geometric phase allows one to identify product states as well as to quantify the global ( meyer - wallach ) entanglement  @xcite induced during the evolution .    the work is organized in the following way . in section",

    "the relationship between entanglement and geometric phases for more general couplings and for initially separable mixed states would be a relevant further contribution to the subject .",
    "moreover , it would also be interesting to investigate whether or not _ initially _ nonseparable states may have their entanglement somewhat related to the behavior of geometric phases acquired during the quantum evolution . we leave these topics to future research .",
