    "a possible relation between the central velocity dispersion of the spheroidal component ( @xmath1 ) and the galaxy circular velocity measured in the flat region of the rotation curve ( @xmath0 ) was suggested by @xcite and @xcite . by measuring h  i  line widths they found that @xmath0@xmath9@xmath1  @xmath10 for a sample of s0 and spiral galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite proceeded further extending the @xmath0@xmath5  relation to elliptical galaxies .",
    "she interpreted the @xmath0@xmath5  relation as suggestive of a correlation between two different galactic components , since @xmath1and @xmath0  probe the potential of the spheroidal component and of the dark matter ( hereafter dm ) halo , respectively . in particular , it results that for a given dm halo the central velocity dispersion of the spheroidal component is independent of the morphological type .",
    "the validity of this relation has been confirmed by @xcite , who enlarged the sample of spiral galaxies .    for elliptical galaxies , @xmath0",
    "is generally inferred by means of dynamical modelling of the stellar kinematics .",
    "this is the case of the giant round and almost non - rotating ellipticals studied by @xcite .",
    "these galaxies form a unique dynamical family which scales with luminosity and effective radius . as a consequence",
    "the maximum circular velocity is correlated to the central velocity dispersion of the galaxy . @xcite . whether the same is true for more flattened and fainter ellipticals is still to be investigated .",
    "on the contrary , both shape and amplitude of the rotation curve of a spiral galaxy depend on the galaxy luminosity and morphological type ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason for spiral galaxies the @xmath0@xmath5  relation is not expected a priori .",
    "it is interesting to investigate whether the @xmath0@xmath5  relation holds also for less dense objects characterized by a less steep potential well .",
    "this is the case of low surface brightness galaxies ( hereafter lsb ) , which are disc galaxies with a central face - on surface brightness @xmath11 mag arcsec@xmath12 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "previous work concentrated on hsb and , to infer the @xmath0  for elliptical galaxies , they relied on stellar dynamical models . in this work we investigated the behavior of elliptical galaxies with hi - based @xmath0  and of lsb galaxies in the @xmath0@xmath5  relation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "an overview of the properties of the sample galaxies as well as the analysis of the kinematic data available in literature to derive their @xmath0  and @xmath1  are presented in sect .",

    "the results and discussion concerning the @xmath0@xmath5  relation are given in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "in the past years we started a scientific program aimed at deriving the detailed kinematics of ionized gas and stars in hsb and lsb galaxies in order to study their mass distribution and structural properties .",
    "we measured the velocity curves and velocity dispersion profiles along the major axis for both the ionized - gas and stellar components for a preliminary sample of @xmath13 hsb galaxies [ @xmath14 s0s0/a galaxies in @xcite ; @xmath15 sa galaxies in @xcite and @xcite ; @xmath16 s0sc galaxies in @xcite ; @xmath17 sb  scd galaxies in @xcite ] and 11 lsb galaxies @xcite    the hsb sample consists of disc galaxies with hubble type ranging from s0 to scd , an inclination @xmath18 and a distance @xmath19 mpc .",
    "the lsb sample consists of disc galaxies with hubble type ranging from sa to irr , an intermediate inclination ( @xmath20 ) , and a distance @xmath21 mpc ( except for eso 534-g20 ) .",
    "three lsb galaxies , namely eso 206-g14 , eso 488-g49 , and lsbc f563-v02 , have been selected from the sample observed by @xcite .",
    "the remaining eight objects are lsb galaxies with bulge .",
    "they have been selected in lauberts & valentijn ( 1989 , hereafter eso - lv ) to have a lsb disc component following the criteria described by @xcite . due to the bulge light contribution",
    "the total central face - on surface brightness of the galaxy could be @xmath22 mag arcsec@xmath12 . however , all these objects do have a lsb disc . as far as their total luminosity concerns ,",
    "lsbc f563-v02 and eso 488-g49 are two dwarf lsb galaxies but the other nine objects are representative of giant lsb galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for all the hsb and lsb galaxies we obtained the ionized - gas rotation curve by folding the observed line - of - sight velocities around the galaxy center and systemic velocity after averaging the contiguous data points and applying a correction for galaxy inclination .",
    "we rejected @xmath23 hsb galaxies because they had asymmetric rotation curves or rotation curves which were not characterized by an outer flat portion .",
    "@xcite and @xcite considered galaxies with the rotation curve extending farther out than @xmath24 . this criterion is not appropriate when the sample galaxies spans a wide range in photometrical properties . for lsb galaxies , which have a lower central surface brightness than hsb galaxies",
    ", @xmath24 corresponds to a relatively small radius where the rotation curve may be still rising . for this reason we adopt a criterion that select rotation curves on the basis of their flatness rather then on their extension .",
    "the flatness of each rotation curve has been checked by fitting it with a linear low @xmath25 for @xmath4 .",
    "the radial range has been chosen in order to avoid the bulge - dominated region of the rotation curve ( e.g. , ic 724 and ngc 2815 ) .",
    "the rotation curves with @xmath26 @xmath3 within 3@xmath27 have been considered not to be flat . in this way",
    "@xmath28 hsb galaxies and @xmath29 lsb galaxies resulted to have a flat rotation curve .",
    "since the velocity curves of the lsb galaxies were not presented in previous papers , we show their folded rotation curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsbvelcur ] .",
    "we derived @xmath0  by averaging the outermost values of the flat portion of the rotation curve .",
    "we are therefore confident that we are giving a reliable estimate of the asymptotic value of the circular velocity which traces the mass of the dm halo ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) .",
    "we derived @xmath1  from the stellar kinematics by extrapolating the velocity dispersion radial profile to @xmath30 .",
    "this has been done by fitting the @xmath29 innermost data points with an empirical function ( either an exponential , or a gaussian or a constant ) .",
    "we did not apply any aperture correction to @xmath1  as discussed by @xcite , and @xcite .    in order to complete our sample of disc galaxies we included all the spiral galaxies previously studied by @xcite and @xcite , but which are in addition characterized by a flat rotation curve .",
    "we therefore applied to this latter galaxy sample the same flatness criterion applied to our sample .    in summary , we have @xmath31 galaxies ( @xmath28 hsb and @xmath29 lsb galaxies ) from our preliminary sample , @xmath16 spiral galaxies ( out of 38 ) from @xcite , and @xmath32 spiral galaxies ( out of 12 ) from @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the final sample of hsb galaxies includes @xmath33 early - type objects with hubble type ranging from s0 to sab . on the contrary ,",
    "the sample by @xcite and @xcite was constituted only by late - type spirals with hubble type sb or later ( except for the sa ngc 2844 ) .",
    "finally , we considered a sample of 24 elliptical galaxies with a flat rotation curve and for which both @xmath0  and @xmath1  are available from the literature .",
    "they include 19 objects studied by @xcite who derived @xmath0  by dynamical modeling and 5 objects for which @xmath0  is directly derived from the flat portion of their h  i  rotation curves .",
    "the addition of these last 5 ellipticals is important as it allows to test against model - dependent biases in the @xmath34 relation .",
    "the @xmath0  of ngc 4278 has been estimated from both the h  i  rotation curve ( * ? ? ?",

    "( 2003 , @xmath68 for a sample of 24 spiral galaxies with @xmath1@xmath8 @xmath7 ) . however , this comparison is affected by the different uncertainties which characterize the @xmath0  and @xmath1  measurements of the three datasets . in order to allow such a comparison we performed the analysis of the scatter of the data points .",
    "we defined the scatter as @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the distance between the @xmath48th data point and the straight line of coefficients @xmath74 and @xmath75 given in eq .",

    "if we consider only the hsb galaxies , the resulting scatter is @xmath76 , @xmath32 and @xmath31 @xmath7  for @xcite , @xcite and our sample , respectively .",
    "the difference in the scatter of the datasets ( e.g. [ @xmath77(this work)@xmath78(ferrarese)]@xmath79 ) is therefore significantly smaller than the difference of the corresponding @xmath80 ( e.g. @xmath80(this work)@xmath81(ferrarese)@xmath82 ) .",
    "this means that the higher value of our @xmath80 is mostly due to the smaller error bars than to the larger intrinsic scatter of our hsb+e data points .",
    "it should be noticed that @xcite and @xcite considered only galaxies with a flat rotation curve extending at a distance @xmath83 larger than the optical radius @xmath24 .",
    "we relaxed this selection criterion to build our final sample and made sure instead that all rotation curves reached the flat outer parts .",
    "the residual plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : rlast ] shows that the scatter of the data points corresponding to our sample galaxies with @xmath0  measured at @xmath84 is comparable to that of the galaxies with @xmath0  measured @xmath85 .",
    "this confirms that this particular scale is not important once the asymptotic part of the rotation curve is reached by the observations .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig : rlast ] indicates that the residuals are particularly large near @xmath86 and that the scatter becomes smaller at @xmath87 . in the latter case",
    "the flat portion of the rotation curve extends on a larger radial range and therefore @xmath0  is measured with a higher precision .",
    "in fact , for @xmath86 the scatter increases symmetrically with either @xmath0@xmath88 and @xmath0@xmath89 values and it indicates that the less extended velocity curves are not introducing any systematic effect . indeed , the slope of the @xmath0@xmath5  relation that we find is consistent with the one proposed by @xcite and @xcite from a sample of more extended velocity curves .",
    "the measured scatter of the complete sample is @xmath90 @xmath7 , which is larger than typical measurement errors for @xmath0  and @xmath1  ( @xmath91@xmath7 ) .",
    "for this reason , the measured scatter is dominated by the intrinsic scatter that we estimate to be @xmath92@xmath7 .",
    "we investigated the location of the elliptical galaxies with @xmath0based on h  i  data and of lsb galaxies in the @xmath0@xmath5  plane .",
    "these types of galaxies were not considered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the data points corresponding to the 5 elliptical galaxies with @xmath0based on h  i  data follow the same relation as the remaining disc and elliptical galaxies . for these h  i  rotation curves we relaxed the flatness criterion in favor of their large radial extension which is about 10 times larger than that of optical rotation curves .",
    "the inclusion of these data points does not change the fit based on the remaining disc and elliptical galaxies .",
    "they are mostly located on the upper end of the @xmath0@xmath5  relation derived for disc galaxies , in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "they studied these elliptical galaxies and showed that their dm content and distribution are similar to those of spiral galaxies .",
    "the lsb and hsb galaxies do not follow the same @xmath0@xmath5  relation .",
    "in fact , most of the lsb galaxies are characterized by a higher @xmath0  for a given @xmath1  ( or a lower @xmath1  for a given @xmath0 ) with respect to hsb galaxies ( fig .",

    "the straight line corresponding to this fit , which is different from the one obtained for hsb and elliptical galaxies and happens to be parallel to it , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] .    to address the significance of this result , which is based only on 8 data points , we compared the distribution of the normalized scatter of the lsb galaxies to that of the hsb and elliptical galaxies .",

    "the two distributions appear to be different , as it is confirmed at a high confidence level ( @xmath98 ) by a kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "the fact that these objects fall in a different region of the @xmath0@xmath5  plane confirms that lsb and hsb galaxies constitute two different classes of galaxies .",
    "both demographics of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) and study of dm distribution in galactic nuclei benefit from the @xmath0@xmath5  relation .",
    "the recent finding that the mass of smbhs correlates with different properties of the host spheroid supports the idea that formation and accretion of smbhs are closely linked to the formation and evolution of their host galaxy .",
    "such a mutual influence substantiates the notion of coevolution of galaxies and smbhs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a task to be pursued is to obtain a firm description of all these relationships spanning a wide range of smbh masses and address if they hold for all hubble types .",
    "in fact , the current demography of smbhs suffers of important biases , related to the limited sampling over the different basic properties of their host galaxies .",
    "the finding that the @xmath0@xmath5  relation holds for small values of @xmath1  points to the idea that smbhs with masses smaller than about @xmath99 m@xmath100 may also exist and follow the m@xmath101-@xmath27 relation .",
    "moreover , it has been suggested that the @xmath0@xmath5  relation is equivalent to one between the masses of smbh and dm halo @xcite because @xmath1  and @xmath0  are related to the masses of the central smbh and dm halo , respectively .",
    "yet , this claim is to be considered with caution , as the demography of smbhs is still limited , in particular as far as spiral galaxies are concerned .",
    "furthermore , the calculation of the virial mass of the dm halo from the measured @xmath0  depends on the assumptions made for the dm density profile and the resulting rotation curve ( e.g. , see the prescriptions by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    ". a better estimate of the virial velocity of the dm halo @xmath102  can be obtained by constraining the baryonic - to - dark matter fraction with detailed dynamical modeling of the sample galaxies .",
    "the resulting @xmath102@xmath103@xmath1  relation is expected to have a smaller scatter than the @xmath0@xmath5  relation .",
    "if the m@xmath101-@xmath27 relation is to hold , the deviation of lsb galaxies _ with bulge _ from the @xmath0@xmath5  of hsb and elliptical galaxies suggests that for a given dm halo mass the lsb galaxies would host a smbh with a smaller mass compared to hsb galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "if the fundamental correlation of smbh mass is with the halo circular velocity , then lsbs should have larger black - hole masses for given bulge dispersion .",
    "the theoretical and numerical investigations of the processes leading to the formation of lsb galaxies this should be accounted for    the collapse of baryonic matter can induce a further concentration in the dm distribution @xcite , and a deepening of the overall gravitational well in the central regions . if this is the case , the finding that at a given dm mass ( as traced by @xmath0 ) the central @xmath1  of lsb galaxies is smaller than in their hsb counterparts , would argue against the relevance of baryon collapse in the radial density profile of dm in lsb galaxies . confirming that lsb galaxies follow a different @xmath0@xmath5  relation will highlight yet another aspect of their different formation history . indeed , lsb galaxies appear to have a central potential well less steep than hsb spirals of the same dm halo mass . if the collapse of baryonic matter causes a compression of the dm halo as well , for lsb galaxies such process may have been less relevant than for hsb galaxies . again",
    "lsb galaxies turn out to be the best tracers of the primordial density profile of dm haloes and therefore in pursuing the nature of dark matter itself .",
