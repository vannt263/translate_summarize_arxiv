    "the sensitivities attainable for force and position measurements of particles in optical tweezers are in the sub - piconewton and sub - nanometer regimes @xcite , respectively .",
    "the application of the optical tweezers technology has led to a more complete biophysical understanding of the kinetics of molecular motors @xcite - a quintessential demonstration of new physical techniques yielding new insights into biology .",
    "beam position and momentum sensing is particularly crucial for particle sensing in optical tweezers enabling high - precision particle position and force measurements @xcite .",

    "@xcite showed that the conventional quadrant detection scheme is non - optimal for measurements of the position and momentum of optical beams , even in the absence of classical noise sources .",
    "an alternative scheme for the optimal detection of the position and momentum of an optical beam was proposed , based on a spatial homodyne detection scheme .",
    "this scheme has also been proven to perform at the quantum limit of light based on cramer - rao informational bounds @xcite .",
    "therefore , it has become apparent that the use of quadrant detection for particle sensing in optical tweezers systems is non - optimal ; and the introduction of spatial homodyne detection could offer the possibility for greater particle tracking sensitivities .    in this paper , we address the pertinent questions for particle sensing technology in optical tweezers systems - have we reached the limit of particle tracking sensitivity and can this limit be surpassed using quantum resources ?",
    "we believe that in answering this technique related question , naturally arises a biophysical question - i.e. with significantly enhanced sensitivities , are we able to detect molecular kinetics , at the single molecule level , that were previously unresolvable ?",
    "this biophysical question has wide implications as there are many vital protein conformational changes that occur in the angstrom regime , and within millisecond timescales @xcite .",

    "therefore , enhanced particle sensing could elucidate these finer features with greater sensitivity than conventional particle sensing techniques in optical tweezers systems .",
    "this paper begins by formalizing an optimal parameter estimation procedure for particle sensing based on the analysis of the spatial properties of the field scattered by a particle in an optical tweezers .",
    "we show that split detection is non - optimal and consequently propose an optimal measurement scheme based on spatial homodyne detection .",
    "the efficacy of particle sensing is evaluated using the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and sensitivity measures ; and the efficacy of spatial homodyne detection and split detection systems are compared .",
    "an optical field can be formalized and described using a range of parameters - e.g. the polarization , the amplitude - phase quadratures , and the transverse spatial profile .",
    "these parameters can be measured using a range of detection techniques ( e.g. polarimetry , direct detection , interferometry and beam profiling ) and an estimate of their values in the presence of classical and quantum noise , and detection inefficiency is obtained . here",
    "we develop a formalism to quantify an arbitrary spatial modification of the field parameterized by a parameter @xmath0 ( e.g. @xmath0 could quantify the displacement of a spatial mode along a transverse axis @xcite ) . in principle , an arbitrary field can be treated and the field properties can be modeled using maxwell s equations @xcite .",

    "however , the optimal lo mode depends on the position of the particle , so to achieve this a dynamical mode optimization routine would need to be implemented . here",
    "we present results with detection optimized for two specific cases : ( i ) for a particle located close to the origin ( @xmath142 ) as modeled in the theory section ; and ( ii ) for a particle displaced from the origin by a factor of order @xmath143 .",
    "for the small displacement limit , the lo field was determined from the first order term in the taylor expansion of eq .",

    "[ snrplot ]  ( d ) and ( e ) , respectively .",
    "one observes that for displacements significantly less than the trapping beam waist size the snr is linear , with the optimum sensitivity - corresponding to maximum slope in the snr - occurring at zero displacement and significantly surpassing that achievable with split detection .",
    "particle tracking with optimum sensitivity is possible in this linear regime . at particle displacements of around @xmath144 m ,",
    "however , the snr peaks .",
    "small displacements of a particle around these points leave the snr unchanged .",
    "hence the signal read out from the spatial homodyne detector also remains unchanged , with the result that particle tracking becomes ineffective .",
    "as the particle position increases further , it moves out of the trapping field , causing a drop in the total scattered power and consequential exponential decay in the snr .",
    "it is possible to recalculate the lo field mode to optimize the sensitivity for particles fluctuating around any arbitrary position by performing a taylor expansion in @xmath0 of the scattered field about that position , and retaining only the first order term .",
    "[ snrplot ]  ( c ) shows the resulting snr and corresponding lo mode shapes when the lo mode is optimized for particles fluctuating around 0.4  @xmath125 m .",
    "notice that now the maximum snr slope , and hence optimum sensitivity , is shifted from zero displacement to displacements of around 0.4  @xmath125 m .",
    "hence , we see that as the tracked particle moves , it is possible to dynamically adjust the lo field shape to optimize the measurement sensitivity and hence the particle tracking .    .",

    "the _ quantum resources _ shaded area indicates the region where quantum resources such as squeezed light @xcite can be used to further enhance the sensitivity of particle sensing measurements.,width=321 ]    we now numerically evaluate the sensitivities of the split and spatial homodyne schemes in the small displacement limit , given by eqs .",
    "( [ senssd ] ) and ( [ senssh ] ) respectively .",
    "the sensitivity is the minimum detectable displacement , defined as the displacement required to change the snr by @xmath146 .",
    "the respective sensitivity curves for ( i ) split and ( ii ) spatial homodyne detection versus the numerical aperture of the objective lens are shown in fig .",
    "[ sensitivityplot ] .",
    "the minimum detectable displacement for both the split and homodyne detection schemes decrease with increasing na of the collection lens .",
    "as the na increases , more of the scattered field is collected , therefore providing more information about the scattering particle .",
    "the spatial homodyne outperforms the split detection scheme for all na values .",
    "this is due to the spatial homodyne scheme providing optimal information extraction of the detected field whereas the split detection scheme only measures partial information of the detected field , as derived in eq .",
    "( [ overlapsd ] ) . therefore curve ( ii ) is the quantum limit for particle sensing in optical tweezers systems . in order to perform measurements below this quantum limit , non - classical resources",
    "have to be used .",
    "for example , squeezed light in the spatial mode @xcite corresponding to the displacement signal mode can be injected into the optical tweezers system to reduce the quantum noise floor and therefore enhance position sensing @xcite .",
    "we have developed a formalism for particle sensing in optical tweezers via the analysis of the transverse spatial modes imaged from a scattered field .",
    "the conventional quadrant detection scheme , used ubiquitously in optical tweezers experiments , was shown to only detect partial information from the scattered light field .",
    "we propose instead the use of spatial homodyne detection whereby optimal information from the scattering particle can be obtained via the appropriate transverse spatial mode - shaping of the lo field .",
    "a numerical simulation of the snr and sensitivity of both split and spatial homodyne detection was presented and we demonstrate that up to an order of magnitude improvement in the sensitivity of spatial homodyne over split detection can be achieved .",
