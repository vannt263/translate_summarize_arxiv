    "the chemostat occupies a central place in mathematical ecology , see the monograph of smith and waltman @xcite .",
    "it is a model of the dynamics of microbial competition . basically , the chemostat consists of a nutrient input , pumped at a constant rate into a well - mixed culture vessel .",

    "however , the particular form ( [ proportionality ] ) of the growth function @xmath10 is not assumed in @xcite and hence , the model ( [ eqfpi ] ) recovers the more general case of _ variable yields _ model @xmath21-\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^np_i(s)x_i,&\\\\[3 mm ]   \\displaystyle x'_i&= & [ q_i(s ) - d_i]x_i , & i=1\\cdots n , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where uptake rate @xmath8 satisfies ( [ pi ] ) and growth rate @xmath16 satisfies ( [ qi ] ) .",

    "the reader is referred to @xcite , section 3 .    in the variable yield case",
    ", the cep has been proved for ( [ eqsqi ] ) , under some technical conditions on the function @xmath44 and @xmath294 , by sari @xcite and sari and mazenc @xcite ( see corollary [ ourthms ] in section [ wolkowicz ] and corollary [ ourthmsm ] in section [ hsu ] ) . it was also shown in @xcite how corollary [ ourthmsm ] can be fruitfully used to analyze the stability properties of systems whose yield functions depend on the variable @xmath31 .",
    "for instance , the cep holds ( see corollary 5 in @xcite ) for the monod model with constant yields replaced by either linear or quadratic functions of @xmath31 , and under certain additional technical assumptions .",
    "another application is given by the model of pilyugin and waltman @xcite which was used to demonstrate that a periodic orbit was possible in the case of variable yield model .",
    "in this model , with two species , where one yield is constant and the other is cubic in @xmath31 , it is shown in @xcite that for some values of the parameters the cep holds ( see corollary 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of the existence of limit cycles in chemostat equations is not always well understood @xcite . in the case of constant yields , numerical simulations of model ( [ eqsxi ] )",
    "have only displayed competitive exclusion .",
    "our results concern also the case of variable yields , for which it is known @xcite that more exotic dynamical behaviors , including limit cycles and chaos , are possible .",
    "thus in the case of variable yields , it is of great importance to have criteria ensuring the global convergence to an equilibrium with at most one surviving species .",
    "the reader interested in biological motivations for the dependence of the yields on the substrate , may consult @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the exclusion of periodic orbits in system ( [ d=1 ] ) was obtained by fiedler and hsu ( see theorem 1.1 in @xcite ) under the following conditions : for all @xmath299 , and @xmath55 @xmath300 @xmath301 even if the result in @xcite does not show the convergence to an equilibrium , it is interesting to compare the constraints on the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 of @xcite with our constraints .",
    "actually , ( [ fh1 ] ) is stronger than ( [ h11 ] ) , since our assumption requires ( [ fh1 ] ) only for @xmath302 and allows the @xmath43 , for @xmath303 , to have other zeros than @xmath107 in @xmath3040,1[$ ] .",
    "let us compare the constraints on @xmath43 and @xmath44 imposed by the inequalities ( [ fh2 ] ) to the constraints imposed by hypothesis ( [ h21 ] ) : notice that ( [ fh2 ] ) is a set of @xmath305 conditions , while ( [ h21 ] ) is a set of at most @xmath306 conditions",
    ". moreover , the constants @xmath88 in the conditions ( [ h21 ] ) give more flexibility to these conditions .",
    "for instance , ( [ h21 ] ) are satisfied by arbitrary monod growth functions and also by a large class of growth functions as it was shown in @xcite . on the other hand , ( [ fh2 ] )",
    "are not satisfied by arbitrary monod functions , see formulas ( 6.10 ) and ( 6.11 ) in @xcite . hence the result in @xcite does not recover the cep , even in the classical and well established case of monod functions and equal removal rates @xcite .",
    "however our theorem recovers a lot of results of the existing literature .",
    "the beautiful geometrical techniques in @xcite , whose purpose is to extend bendixon - dulac criterion to higher dimension are innovative and it seems likely that @xcite is destined to be cited more often for these innovative techniques rather than for the specific results that are proved for the cep .    for the purpose of comparison between our result and the result of fiedler and hsu @xcite , we just mentioned two caveats on theorem 1.1 in @xcite : first , this theorem does not recover many of the biologically interesting classical examples where the cep is known to hold , and second , it does not prove the convergence to an equilibrium .",
    "these caveats were already mentioned in @xcite , section 6 .",
    "another caveat must be signaled .",
    "fiedler and hsu claimed ( see @xcite , section 6 ) that , in the case @xmath69 of a single species , condition ( [ fh2 ] ) holds trivially and there is no periodic orbit for system ( [ eqsx ] ) .",
    "it should be noticed that condition ( [ fh1 ] ) is not sufficient to exclude periodic orbits .",
    "of course , if @xmath307 , then the bendixon - dulac criterion can be applied to exclude periodic orbits ( see section [ n=1 ] ) .",
    "this assumption on the monotonicity of @xmath308 is not explicitly stated in theorem 1.1 in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the condition @xmath307 would not be satisfactory from the biological point of view .",
    "indeed , a variable yield term @xmath309 can lead to nonmonotone uptake term @xmath310 even if the growth term @xmath311 is monotone ( see section [ n=1 ] ) .",
    "fiedler and hsu , see section 6 in @xcite , claimed that the construction of lyapunov functions in @xcite strictly depends on the proportionality ( [ proportionality ] ) required in equations ( [ eqsxi ] ) .",
    "we show how the lyapunov function used by hsu himself @xcite for the monod case , more than thirty years ago , can be extended to the case of ( [ eqfpi ] ) , where growth rates are not required to be proportional to food uptake ( see theorem [ ourthm ] , in section [ hsu ] ) .",
    "for that reason , the direct proof of theorem [ ourthm ] , using the extension of the lyapunov function of hsu @xcite , seems to be interesting in itself .",
    "thus , i decided to give theorem [ ourthm ] and its direct proof , despite the fact that this theorem is a corollary of theorem [ ourthm1 ] ( see proposition [ prop1 ] in section [ hsu ] ) .",
    "we list some references to the existing literature which inspired our approach .",
    "the lyapunov function ( [ lyapunov ] ) used in the proof of theorem [ ourthm ] was introduced in @xcite as an extension of the lyapunov function ( [ hsu ] ) that hsu used in @xcite in the monod case ( theorem 3.3 in @xcite ) . in the case of one species ,",
    "this lyapunov function is equal to the function ( [ lpw ] ) used by pilyugin and waltman ( lemma 2.3 in @xcite ) , as shown in section [ n=1 ] .",
    "it is also a multiple of the lyapunov function that ballyk , lu , wolkowicz and xia used in @xcite , page 1039 or @xcite , section 3.3 ( see section 3.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the lyapunov function ( [ lyapunov1 ] ) used in the proof of theorem [ ourthm1 ] was introduced in @xcite as an extension of the lyapunov function ( [ lwl ] ) that wolkowicz and lu used in @xcite in the constant yields case ( theorem 2.3 in @xcite ) . in the case of one species , it is a multiple of the lyapunov function ( [ apw ] ) used by arino , pilyugin and wolkowicz ( theorem 2.11 in @xcite ) , as shown in section [ n=1 ] .    in this work ,",
    "we have analyzed a general model of the chemostat with several species competing for a substrate , under the assumption that uptake rates and growth rates are not proportional .",
    "each species is characterized by its specific growth rate , its specific removal rate , and its variable yield .",
    "our study reveals that the cep holds for a large class of systems : the species with the smallest break - even concentration can be the winner of the competition if some supplementary conditions , involving the uptake and growth functions are satisfied .",
    "hence , even if the break - even concentration are depending only on the growth rates and not on the yields functions , the issue of competition depends really on the yield functions .",
    "for instance , if one on the species exhibits a linear yield , and if the parameter in the yield is enlarged , then the equilibrium , where only the winning species survives , can be destabilized , and oscillatory coexistence of more than one species becomes possible .",
