    "the study of solar neutrinos was initiated by the pioneering experimental efforts of ray davis coupled with theoretical work of john bahcall .",
    "the original objective was to study the physics of the sun .",
    "the set of measurements that have been carried out over more than 35 years have provided detailed information on solar properties and have confirmed the accuracy of the standard solar model .",
    "these measurements have also provided extensive information on the physics of neutrinos themselves , including observations of flavor change that extend beyond the standard model of elementary particle physics .",
    "the theoretical aspects of solar neutrino measurements and their impact on solar models and neutrino properties are described in detail in the following paper  @xcite by bahcall and pena - garay .",
    "the present paper will describe the experiments that have been carried out to date and will provide a description of potential future experiments and their objectives .",
    "the models of the sun have been developed to a high degree of detail over many years .",
    "the reactions that provide the thermonuclear power for the sun also emit copious numbers of neutrinos with energies ranging up to about 18 mev .",
    "( see figure 1 and table 1 in reference @xcite ) .",
    "these neutrinos are very difficult to detect because of the very low neutrino cross sections and invariably require deep underground locations to get away from radioactive backgrounds induced by cosmic rays .",
    "the detection reactions that have been used for solar neutrinos are of two types :    * radiochemical measurements involving the transformation of atoms of an element such as cl or ga into another radioactive element through inverse beta decay induced by electron neutrinos .",
    "these reactions can be observed by sweeping the radioactive elements from the detector volume and observing the subsequent decay .",
    "the measurements on chlorine by ray davis and his co - workers  @xcite and on ga by the sage  @xcite , gallex and gno  @xcite experiments typically involve collection periods on the order of a month and subsequent decay measurement periods of many months . * the observation of events in real time produced by neutrino interactions in light water ( kamiokande  @xcite and super - kamiokande  @xcite ) and heavy water ( sno )  @xcite via the cerenkov process .",
    "the reactions that have been used involve elastic scattering of neutrinos from electrons , the inverse beta decay reaction on deuterium producing energetic electrons and inelastic scattering on deuterium producing free neutrons .",
    "the inverse beta decay on deuterium is sensitive only to electron neutrinos , the inelastic scattering on deuterium is equally sensitive to all neutrino types and the elastic scattering on electrons is predominantly sensitive to electron neutrinos , with a small ( about 14% ) sensitivity to other neutrino types .",
    "these experiments have a variety of neutrino energy thresholds and are therefore sensitive to different combinations of the neutrino - producing reactions in the sun .",
    "figure 1 of reference @xcite shows the thresholds for the above experiments and illustrates that the gallium experiments have about one - half of their sensitivity from the pp reaction , the chlorine - based measurements have sensitivity primarily to the @xmath1b neutrinos with some sensitivity to @xmath0be and the light and heavy water - based experiments are sensitive almost exclusively to the @xmath1b neutrinos with a negligible contribution from the hep neutrinos .",
    "starting with the measurements on chlorine and continuing with measurements on gallium and light water , too few neutrinos were observed in comparison to the predictions of solar models .",
    "this came to be known as the solar neutrino problem and was extensively discussed in the scientific literature .",
    "the attempts to explain the experimental data generally involved a ) changes to the solar models to modify the predicted neutrino fluxes or b ) proposals for new physical properties of neutrinos , such as oscillations among neutrino types leading to a smaller flux of electron neutrinos reaching the detectors .",
    "the initial detectors were either exclusively or predominantly sensitive to electron neutrinos and so neutrino oscillation would result in lower observed fluxes .",
    "the oscillation of massive neutrinos can be modified by interactions with electrons in the sun ( or the earth ) ( the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein or msw effect  @xcite ) that can result in neutrino - energy - dependent probabilities for oscillation .",
    "in addition , other mechanisms such as neutrino decay  @xcite or resonant spin - flavor precession ( rsfp )  @xcite were considered as explanations for the small observed fluxes .",
    "very detailed measurements of the energy dependence and time - dependence of @xmath1b fluxes were carried out by the super - kamiokande experiment with no statistically significant effects observed .",
    "calculations of possible changes to solar models did not provide modifications to neutrino fluxes that agreed with the observed data . a firm conclusion on whether neutrino flavor change was taking place depended on solar model calculations of the relative size of the various neutrino fluxes . although solar models provided very good agreement with all other solar properties , including helioseismology measurements  @xcite , it was difficult to be certain whether changes to solar models or changes to neutrino properties might be required to explain the discrepancy between experiment and theory .",
    "subsequently , the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) experiment performed measurements of the interactions of @xmath1b neutrinos with deuterium and was able to demonstrate in a manner independent of detailed solar model flux calculations that neutrino flavor change was definitely taking place .",
    "the measurement showed that the flux of all active neutrinos was about three times the flux of electron neutrinos , clearly indicating the transformation of electron neutrinos to other active types .",
    "in addition , the measurement of the total active @xmath1b neutrino flux was found to be in excellent agreement with the prediction of the standard solar model calculations .",
    "the set of solar neutrino measurements to date defines a well - localized region of parameter space for neutrino mixing that also describes the oscillation of reactor anti - neutrinos observed recently by the kamland experiment .",
    "the observation of similar parameters for oscillation in these two cases provides strong restrictions on cpt , as well as restricting possible contributions from sterile neutrinos , rsfp , neutrino decay , and flavor - changing neutral current interactions .",
    "this overall set of measurements has thereby made a significant impact on our understanding of the sun and of the basic properties of neutrinos .",
    "neutrino physics has now moved to a precision phase and future measurements are aimed at the definition of neutrino properties and parameters of the maki - nakagawa - sakahata - pontecorvo ( mnsp )  @xcite mixing matrix with higher precision .",
    "they also will improve our knowledge of possible sub - dominant processes mentioned above .",
    "future solar neutrino measurements are primarily aimed at observation of low energy fluxes and will thereby extend our detailed understanding of the neutrino processes in the sun .",
    "the following sections will describe the measurements to date as well as further experiments that are being developed .",
    "in the late 1960 s , ray davis and co - workers @xcite began their pioneering solar neutrino measurements using 680 tons of liquid perchlorethylene sited 1480 meters underground ( 4300 meters water equivalent ( m.w.e))in the homestake gold mine near lead , south dakota , usa to observe electron neutrinos from the sun . the electron neutrino capture reaction on @xmath2cl produces radioactive @xmath2ar atoms ( 35-day half life ) in the liquid .",
    "the @xmath2ar atoms are flushed with helium gas every 100 days and condensed into sensitive proportional counters .",
    "about 0.5 argon atoms per day are produced .",
    "the capture reaction on @xmath2cl is calculated to be sensitive primarily to neutrinos from @xmath1b decay in the sun , but there is substantial sensitivity to neutrinos from @xmath0be as well .",
    "the detector is sited underground to reduce @xmath2ar production by cosmic rays .",
    "detector and proportional counter materials are carefully selected to minimize contributions from background radioactivity .",
    "background rates of @xmath2ar from sources other than the sun are restricted to about 0.02 atoms per day .",
    "non - radioactive tracer isotopes @xmath3ar and @xmath4ar are injected during successive runs to determine the argon extraction efficiency and are measured by mass spectrometry .",
    "pulse shape analysis is used on the pulses from the proportional counter to reduce counter backgrounds from other than @xmath2ar decay .",
    "the detector has been operated from 1968 until 2002 and the cumulative average of the data @xcite is @xmath5 snu , where a solar neutrino unit ( snu ) is defined as one electron neutrino capture per @xmath6 atoms of @xmath2cl per second .",
    "this result is substantially smaller than the predictions of standard solar model  @xcite of @xmath7 snu ( model bp04 ) .",
    "experiments studying the electron neutrino capture reaction on ga ( @xmath8ga(@xmath9,e@xmath10)@xmath8ge ) are being carried out in the baksan laboratory ( depth of 4700 m.w.e . ) in russia ( sage ) @xcite with about 60 tons of liquid ga metal and in the gran sasso laboratory ( 3300 m.w.e ) in italy ( gallex , gno ) @xcite with 30.3 tons of ga in a concentrated gacl@xmath11-hcl solution .    the radioactive decay of @xmath8ge ( half - life 11.4 days ) is observed after extraction and deposition into low - background proportional counters .",
    "somewhat different extraction techniques are used for the two experiments . in sage ,",
    "the ge is removed by extraction into an aqueous solution via an oxidation reaction , followed by concentration , conversion to gecl@xmath12 and synthesis to geh@xmath12 for use in the proportional counter . in gallex and gno ,",
    "volatile @xmath8gecl@xmath12 is formed directly in the target solution , swept out by nitrogen gas , absorbed in water and then converted to geh@xmath12 .",
    "the detectors are very carefully made from low radioactivity materials and external background is carefully controlled in the counting facilities .",
    "intense @xmath13cr sources @xcite have been used to calibrate the sensitivity of the detector to neutrinos .",
    "the results from these experiments to date @xcite are as follows : gallex + gno : @xmath14 snu , sage : @xmath15 snu .",
    "these numbers are in excellent agreement and are much smaller than the predictions of the standard solar model ( 131 snu )  @xcite .        from 1983 to 1996",
    "the 1 kiloton ( 680 ton fiducial ) light water neutrino detector , kamiokande  @xcite ( 1000 meters underground , 2600 m.w.e . ) in the kamioka mine in japan , studied solar neutrinos , as well as other physics processes such as proton decay and atmospheric neutrinos . in 1996 , the much larger ( 22.5 kton light water ) super - kamiokande detector  @xcite began operation at the same site , studying solar neutrinos and other physics with higher sensitivity .",
    "solar neutrinos are observed through the elastic scattering of neutrinos from electrons , observed by the detection of cerenkov light from the recoiling electron .",
    "the energy threshold for kamiokande was about 7 mev and about 5 mev for super - kamiokande .",
    "therefore the sensitivity of these detectors is almost entirely for @xmath1b solar neutrinos with a tiny contribution from the @xmath16hep reaction .    for kamiokande ,",
    "the flux of neutrinos from the @xmath1b decay was measured  @xcite to be @xmath17 @xmath18 s@xmath19 , clearly less than the solar model prediction  @xcite of @xmath20 @xmath18 s@xmath19 .",
    "studies of the variation in flux as a function of time showed no statistically significant effects .    the solar neutrino flux from @xmath1b decay measured by super - kamiokande  @xcite is @xmath21 @xmath18 s@xmath19 , and is also significantly smaller than the solar model prediction .",
    "the neutrino energy spectrum is very similar to that expected from @xmath1b decay and no distortion due to the msw effect  @xcite has been observed .",
    "figure  [ fig : skspectrum ] shows a comparison of the observed spectrum with the spectrum from @xmath1b decay .",
    "solar neutrino elastic scattering energy spectrum ( top ) and d / n asymmetry ( bottom ) as measured by super - kamiokande .",
    "the predictions ( solid lines ) are for the lma solution .",
    "the gray bands are the @xmath22 ranges for the asymmetry over the entire energy range.,width=4 ]    to look for indications of the msw effect through regeneration of neutrinos",
    "while passing through the earth  @xcite , an analysis of the spectra including solar zenith angle has been performed .",
    "figure  [ fig : skspectrum ] also shows the spectra for day and night and it is clear that there is no significant difference observed .",
    "a maximum likelihood analysis of this 1496 days of data shows a day - night asymmetry of @xmath23 , consistent with zero and with the expected value ( 2.1 ) from the most recent analysis of the lma solution for neutrino oscillations as discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "a further analysis of the data was carried out , seeking distortion of the @xmath1b energy spectrum from magnetic scattering associated with a finite neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "potential distortions of the weak es spectrum from oscillation of @xmath1b neutrinos were taken into account by incorporating data from other solar neutrino experiments and an upper limit for the neutrino magnetic moment of @xmath24 was obtained for 90 % confidence level  @xcite .",
    "if there were a significant neutrino magnetic moment , this could couple with solar magnetic field distributions and produce different observed fluxes through flavor change as neutrinos pass through different solar regions at various times of year .",
    "however , the neutrino flux as a function of time of year is observed by the super - kamiokande measurements to follow the variation expected for the earth - sun distance variation with no observable additional effects as shown in figure  [ fig : skseasonal ] . with the full 1496 day data set , the amplitude of the neutrino flux variation is measured to be @xmath25 ( consistent with one ) times the amplitude expected from the eccentricity of the earth s orbit .",
    "the perihelion shift is measured to be @xmath26 days ( consistent with zero ) .",
    "studies over longer periods of time to seek correlations between the data and the sunspot numbers ( indicative of magnetic fields in the outer regions of the sun ) also show no correlations  @xcite .",
    "seasonal variation of the solar neutrino flux as measured by super - kamiokande .",
    "the curve shows the expected seasonal variation of the flux introduced by the eccentricity of the earth s orbit.,width=4 ]      the principal objective of the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) has been the clear observation of flavor change for @xmath1b solar neutrinos by a comparison of the total flux of active neutrinos from decay with the total flux of electron neutrinos .",
    "the measurement of flavor change does not rely on solar model calculations and in fact , the total flux of active neutrinos can be compared with the predicted flux of @xmath1b neutrinos as a test of those calculations .",
    "the fluxes are measured through the following reactions in a heavy - water - based cerenkov detector :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     _ es measurements _    measurements at the borexino ctf  @xcite indicate @xmath27c/@xmath28c ratios of about 10@xmath29 in organic scintillators .",
    "this background is a problem for the measurement of pp - neutrinos in es experiments because of the 156 kev @xmath30-decay endpoint for @xmath27c .",
    "therefore a number of experiments under development are based on inorganic materials , principally a noble gas scintillator .",
    "such scintillators can provide over 4 times as many photons as a typical liquid scintillator but the photons are at uv wavelengths and so wavelength shifters are required .    the xmass experiment  @xcite proposes to use 10 tons of liquid xenon to observe pp and @xmath0be solar neutrinos via scintillation light .",
    "this mass could provide 10 events / day for pp and 5 events per day for @xmath0be neutrinos .",
    "the experiment is being developed in stages .",
    "presently a 100 kg prototype detector is in operation and has confirmed initial monte carlo calculations for detector performance .",
    "it is proposed to build a 1 ton detector before moving to the full scale experiment .",
    "the detector is located in an ultra - clean facility in the kamioka mine near the super - kamiokande detector .",
    "for the 10 ton detector a 2.5 meter diameter spherical design is planned using low - background steel photomultiplier tubes with quartz windows that can operate at liquid xenon temperature .",
    "distillation techniques have been developed and applied to reduce @xmath31kr background by up to a factor of 300 in one pass .",
    "the two - neutrino double beta decay of @xmath32xe has not be measured to date and will be one of the objectives of the first two phases .",
    "if its magnitude is too high , isotope separation may be necessary to remove the @xmath32xe for the solar neutrino measurements . for 5 years of operation of the full scale xmass detector , for the detection of pp - neutrinos",
    ", nakahata has indicated  @xcite an expected sensitivity to @xmath33 of about @xmath34 .    the heron experiment  @xcite design uses liquid helium with detection via scintillation and/or observation with wafer calorimeters of rotons or electron - bubbles formed at the surface of the helium .",
    "tests have been performed of this innovative technology and detector simulations performed including background estimates .",
    "the use of helium provides an inherently low - background medium for the measurements .",
    "a 20-ton detector is planned with pp - neutrino rates of more than 1000/year in the fiducial volume . with spectral measurements on the pp spectrum",
    ", the shape could provide a sensitive probe of neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "liquid neon is the basis for the clean experimental design  @xcite .",
    "neon has no long - lived radioactive isotopes , is an excellent scintillator , has a higher density than liquid helium , can be readily purified and is relatively inexpensive .",
    "a spherical design with a full radius of 3 meters and a fiducial radius of 1.5 meters is being considered .",
    "monte carlo simulations indicate that the detector would be capable of sensitive dark matter measurements as well as accurate pp- and @xmath0be flux measurements .",
    "a large ( 18 m @xmath35 20 m ) high - pressure ( 10 atmosphere ) time projection chamber using 97 % helium gas has been proposed  @xcite to measure the spectra for low - energy solar neutrinos .",
    "the detector technology would build on the munu detector experience and could provide directional identification of the es reaction through its strong angular distribution for the recoil electrons",
    ". as with the other detectors , dark matter detection would also be one of the objectives of the design .",
    "_ cc measurements _    the lens experiment  @xcite has been working with a low - background test facility to develop a cc measurement based on @xmath36 in ( with a threshold energy 120 kev ) in a metallo - organic scintillator .",
    "scintillators have been developed with over 5 % loading by weight of in and acceptable light attenuation lengths . a detector with high granularity is required to identify the background events .",
    "therefore the detector design has many modules .",
    "the neutrino events will be tagged by two gammas from a cascade in the final nucleus , reducing background from radioactivity significantly",
    ". a total volume of about 60 tons of indium in 3000 tons of liquid scintillator is planned  @xcite .",
    "this would provide about 3 events per day for either a pp or a @xmath0be flux at 0.6 of the standard solar model .",
    "the nuclear matrix element for the low energy neutrino absorption reaction has been measured through the ( p , n ) reaction . however , to provide an accurate calibration , an measurement with an @xmath2ar radioactive neutrino source is planned .",
    "the moon  @xcite experiment proposes to use a low energy inverse electron capture reaction on @xmath37mo to observe pp neutrinos with excellent sensitivity and a threshold energy of 168 kev .",
    "the daughter nucleus @xmath37tc beta decays with a half life of 16 seconds , so the signature of the cc reaction is two localized electrons .",
    "@xmath37mo itself undergoes two - neutrino double beta decay at a rate that constitutes a background for the detection of solar neutrinos and so a detector with small modules is used to discriminate double beta decays from neutrino events .",
    "a design is under development using optical fibers for an extensive modular structure .",
    "a counting rate of 0.4 events per day for pp - neutrinos is projected for a detector containing about 3 tons of @xmath37mo isotope .",
    "measurements of solar neutrinos have contributed substantially to our knowledge of neutrino properties and of the physics of the sun .",
    "neutrino flavor change has been clearly observed in an appearance measurement .",
    "a series of sensitive measurements with different energy thresholds have tested the standard solar model for the dominant reactions and there is very good agreement .",
    "the measurements to date , combined with reactor anti - neutrino measurements have defined the flavor change mechanism to be the oscillation of massive neutrinos and defined the acceptable range of oscillation parameters with reasonable accuracy .",
    "they have also provided limits at the 10 % level for sub - dominant components such as sterile neutrinos .",
    "future experiments will provide further accuracy for neutrino oscillation parameters as well as providing the first measurements of individual neutrino reactions at low energy to probe solar models with greater sensitivity .",
