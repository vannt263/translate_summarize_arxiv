    "in contrast to the other regions , e.g. , m 42 , the exciting source of ngc 2024 is not directly identified due to the heavy obscuration by the central dust lane .",

    "our imaging polarimetry data can be used to constrain the location of ionizing source(s ) of the nebula through the polarization vector analysis assuming that the ionizing source and the illuminating source are the same .",
    "the vector map is shown in fig .",
    "3 . we found the vector patterns clearly appear centrosymmetric , and normal lines of each vector intersect at the position near the center of ngc 2024 shown by white plus symbol .",
    "the location of dominant illuminating source(s ) of ngc 2024 is then determined to be located within the white circle ( @xmath78 error circle ) in fig .",
    "we note that the locations of both irs 2 and irs 2b are included in the error circle but irs 2b is closer to the center .",
    "the vector patterns at @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are consistent with each other and result in the coincident symmetry center position .",
    "we colored polarization vectors black or green based on the angle @xmath45 between each vector and the line toward white plus symbol ; vectors which seem to follow centrosymmetry , showing @xmath79@xmath3 , are in white , and other vectors are in green .",
    "polarization vectors are mostly colored in white , indicating that most of the large - scale nebulosities are illuminated from star(s ) in the central region enclosed by white circle .",
    "the green vectors tend to be distributed over the north - south dark dust lane and around small - scale irne , which can be explained by superposition of the large - scale nebulosities and extra polarization fields , i.e. , dichroic absorption of foreground materials and intrinsic polarization of small - scale irne .",
    "we found five new small - scale irne ( irn 1 - 5 ) associated with stars that are shown in the @xmath50 image in fig .",
    "an object enclosed by dashed line circle is the irn associated with fir 4 , which was studied previously by moore & yamashita ( 1995 ) with near - infrared polarimetry .",
    "we show @xmath50 and vector maps of irn in fig .",
    "it is clear that the pattern of the polarization vector appears centrosymmetric indicating that the nebulosity is associated with the central star , and responsible for the structure of circumstellar matter ( e.g. , disk / envelope systems ) that produces strongly polarized light through dust scattering .",
    "the small nebulae in a larger scale nebulosity or embedded in the cloud should be treated with caution , because the polarization toward such nebulae is a superposition of different polarization vectors ( i.e. , scattered light polarization and dichroic polarization ) .",
    "we subtracted local background ( constant value ) around small - scale irne from the stokes @xmath39 and @xmath40 images in order to suppress the contribution from larger nebulosities .",
    "we determined the @xmath39 and @xmath40 background levels at the position 20@xmath7 away from the center of irn , and simply subtracted it from the original .",
    "we did not take the effect of dichroic polarization into account , because the resulting vector pattern of irne after the subtraction of local background was reasonably centrosymmetric and the estimate of dichroic polarization is not straightforward .",
    "all irne have certain structures on the @xmath50 images .",
    "the spatial extent of small - scale irne is typically about @xmath80 au on the @xmath50 images , comparable to the size of @xmath8envelopes@xmath9 rather @xmath8disks@xmath9 .",
    "irne show an elongated polarized emission pattern whose position angle is roughly 90 , 135 , 30 , 45 , and 135@xmath3 for irn 1 - 5 , respectively .",
    "the emission pattern of irn 1 , 2 , and 4 is clearly butterfly - shaped , and the dark lane extending perpendicular to the bright region can be seen in these irne .",
    "for irn 3 and 5 , the elongated emission pattern can only be seen on one side of the central star .",
    "these characteristics agree with the polarization picture of disk / envelope system around young stars ( e.g. , nagata , sato , & kobayashi 1983 ; hodapp 1984 ; sato et al .",
    "the radiation from the star causes heavy extinction toward the direction of disk ( seen as a dark lane ) , but can escape toward the polar directions and then scattered by dust at the surface of the envelope or the cavity created by the outflow ( seen as a butterfly - shaped or monopolar irn ) .    in fig . 5",
    ", we show @xmath50 and vector maps of the irn associated with fir 4 in the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 bands .",
    "the counterpart of fir 4 is best seen in the @xmath31 band and located at ( @xmath81r.a . , @xmath81dec .",
    ") = ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) in fig .",
    "5 . our vector maps show good agreement with those in the @xmath30 and @xmath75 bands reported by moore & yamashita ( 1995 ) .",
    "the irn appears as a monopolar shape with position angle of @xmath84 , and shows a centrosymmetric vector pattern centered on fir 4 .",
    "the axis of irn is consistent with that of the molecular outflow associated with fir 4 ( chandler & carlstrom 1996 ) .",
    "the position angle of the polarization vector toward fir 4 is @xmath85 , perpendicular to the axis of irn , which is the general tendency in young stellar objects with irn ( see above ) .    in table 1 , we summarize the observational properties of irne and its central stars .",
    "the polarization degree of each irn ( column 4 - 6th ) is not large , because unpolarized light from the hii region ( e.g. , free - free ionized gas emission ) dilute the polarized light .",
    "if we subtract the background intensity around irn , the polarization degrees increase to the level comparable with typical reflection nebulae in other star forming regions as shown in parentheses . the irn 1 - 5",
    "are associated with stars irs 12 , 4 , 3 , 28 and 30 , respectively . from their near - infrared colors , we found that the central stars of five irne are young , especially in a pre - main - sequence phase .",
    "the infrared color of the five sources were investigated in the @xmath86 bands by haisch et al .",
    "based on the @xmath87 @xmath10 m spectral index @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) measurements , the five sources , irs 12 ( irn 1 ) , irs 4 ( irn 2 ) , irs 3 ( irn 3 ) , irs28 ( irn 4 ) , and irs 30 ( irn 5 ) , were classified into class ii , class i , class ii , class ii , and flat spectrum , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that they are accompanied by nebulous circumstellar materials .",
    "following the method described in @xmath90 2 , we performed aperture polarimetry of the central stars ( column 12 - 13 ) . except for the saturated source irs 12 and the source irs 3 with faint irn , we found that the polarization vector angle @xmath45 of stars is roughly perpendicular to the major axis of irn ( column 3 ) .",
    "the characteristic is in good agreement with those for young stellar objects accompanied by irne .",
    "these sources serve as good target for future studies in higher resolution at various wavelengths ( e.g. , large opt - ir telescopes , alma ) as well as in theoretical modeling .",
    "we performed software aperture polarimetry of point - like sources in order to measure the integrated polarization of possible unresolved nebulae .",
    "our photometry and polarimetry of 211 stars with @xmath0 detections are shown in table 2 .",
    "the polarization vectors in the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 bands are quite consistent with each other . for the sources with @xmath91 of less than 3@xmath3 ( 63 sources ) , the correlation coefficient for ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) and ( @xmath92 , @xmath94 ) is 0.99 and 0.98 , respectively .",

    "these slopes are consistent with the empirical value of 1.61 and 0.61 from the relation @xmath104 , where @xmath105 ( whittet 1992 ) . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the aperture polarimetry results in the @xmath30 band where nebula contamination is less than in the @xmath29 band and scattering efficiency is higher than in the @xmath31 band .",
    "we can detect candidate stars with intrinsic polarization ( i.e. , with circumstellar material ) by selecting the sources with larger polarizations than values estimated from the dichroic absorption due to foreground material .",
    "firstly , we made two color diagram for all the sources detected in the @xmath0 bands in order to classify the sample into three groups of the dwarf+giant , pms stars , and protostars . the result is shown in fig .",
    "we found 143 stars in the dwarf+giant star region ( filled circle ) , 63 stars in the pms star region ( open diamond ) , and 5 stars located on right to the pms region , i.e. , protostar region ( open circle ) .",
    "we plotted these sources in @xmath106 versus @xmath107 diagram shown in fig .",
    "the value of 0.15 mag is the mean intrinsic color of stars ( mostly g to m dwarfs ) toward the object calculated using the galaxy model ( wainscoat & cohen , 1992 ; cohen , 1994 ) , so that the horizontal axis of fig .",
    "6b corresponds to the mean @xmath108 .",

    "a linear least absolute deviation fitting to our @xmath106 and @xmath107 data resulted in @xmath110 ( solid line ) , where we forced the intercept value to be zero in the fitting .",
    "our fitting result shows a similar relationship to the relation from jones ( 1989 ) .",
    "the polarization of stars with @xmath111 is dominated by dichroic polarization produced by aligned interstellar dust grains .",
    "observational upper limit of the relationship ( dot - dashed line ) can be described using the equation @xmath112 where @xmath113 when the parameter @xmath114 is set to 0.875 ( jones 1989 ) .",
    "the sources with larger @xmath115 values can be better candidates to show excess ( intrinsic ) polarizations , and hense good targets for further observations in order to study circumstellar materials around stars .",
    "we calculated @xmath115 for each star , where @xmath116 was measured on the two color diagram ( fig .",
    "the histogram of @xmath115 is shown in fig .",
    "7 . in the histogram",
    ", there is a clear peak around @xmath111 , which corresponds to the sources mainly affected by interstellar polarization .",
    "we found that the dwarf+giant stars ( filled circle ) and pms stars ( open diamond ) show similar distribution in fig .",
    "if we regard the stars with @xmath117 , two times larger @xmath115 than the interstellar polarization , as highly polarized sources ( hps ) , the fraction of hps is 32 % , 31 % , and 35 % for all the stars , dwarf+giant stars , and , pms stars , respectively .",
    "the protostar candidates are not included in this statistics , because their intrinsic colors are not known .",
    "it is an interesting result that there is no tendency of higher polarization in earlier evolutionary stages or larger infrared excess .",
    "however , since the part of the locus of classical t tauri stars overlaps with the reddening band , some fraction of pms stars can be included in the sample of dwarf+giant stars .",
    "thus the hps fraction for the dwarf+giant group may cause significant contamination from pms stars and caution must be applied .",
    "it is of particular interest to investigate the fraction of hps against the luminosity of stars ( @xmath2 mass ) , because the information should be closely related to the dependence of the population of stars with circumstellar disk on the mass of stars .",
    "though the probability of disk inclination , orientation , and suffered extinction from foreground materials is expected to be random , other factors , the shape ( scale height ) and evolutional timescale ( lifetime ) of disk , may have some dependence on stellar mass .",
    "it is likely that the effect of disk lifetime on the detection ratio of hps is not significant . as shown in fig .",
    "6a , many sources are located in the class ii region in the two color diagram . by using @xmath58 vs. @xmath118 diagram , haisch et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported that infrared excess stars ( class ii and protostars ) occupy @xmath119 % fraction of the stellar population in this region .",
    "since the age of most sources could be younger than or comparable with disk lifetime ( @xmath120 myr , strom & edwards 1993 ) , the observed hps fraction should not be affected by the disk lifetime .",
    "theoretically very low mass stars ( i.e. , brown dwarfs ) are expected to have a more flared ( larger scale height ) disk than those for more massive stars due to its small gravity ( walker et al .",
    "highly flared disks result in a large fraction of obscured stars due to extinction , so that only scattered light is observed , making the source a hps .",
    "considering the disk optical depth ( i.e. , size and mass ) and its flaring for several models , the disk obscuring probability of brown dwarfs in the @xmath75 band ( @xmath121 m ) was estimated to be larger than that for class ii stars by a factor of @xmath122 ( walker et al .",
    "thus , a stellar mass dependence of hps detection rate may be observed .    to derive intrinsic luminosities , we performed dereddening of stars by subtracting @xmath116 from observed @xmath30 magnitudes .",
    "we then derived the fraction of sources with @xmath123 against dereddened @xmath30 mag at each bin separated by 1 mag .",
    "the result is shown in table 3 .",
    "note that stars with @xmath124 mag are brown dwarfs at the employed distance of 415 pc ( anthony - twarog 1982 ) .",
    "we found that the distribution of polarization fraction remains constant from low ( brown dwarfs ) to higher luminosity ( solar - type ) stars , although the error in polarization fraction is not small . according to the argument above",
    ", our finding suggests that the dependence of disk scale height on the mass of central star is not significant in spite of the theoretical model that predicts more flared disks for lower mass stars .",
    "it is noteworthy that a very similar result is obtained in the omc-1 region ( kusakabe et al .",
    "quantitative studies on the origin of flat hps distributions will be discussed in a later paper .",

    "2004 ) reported the spectroscopic studies of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs distributed over @xmath125 region in ngc 2024 .",
    "their list of 71 stars with known spectral type can be more useful to investigate the relationship between stellar mass and @xmath115 .",
    "we matched the coordinates of their sources with our polarimetry , and found 49 pairs .",
    "we show the stellar mass versus @xmath115 diagram in fig .",
    "the vertical and horizontal broken lines denote the upper limit of brown dwarf mass ( 0.08 @xmath126 ) and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "it is clear that there is no obvious tendency for higher @xmath115 for lower mass stars . if we divide the sources into two groups at the line of @xmath128 , the median @xmath115 value with @xmath129 error is @xmath130 and @xmath131 for the lower and higher mass groups , respectively .",
    "there can be a tendency of slightly higher @xmath115 for brown dwarfs than that for solar - type stars , but , within 1@xmath132 , those two values are identical .",
    "we should also note the difference in suffered mean extinction for both groups is small ( @xmath133 mag and @xmath134 mag ) .",
    "we conclude that the stellar mass vs. @xmath115 relationship is generally flat in the mass range from brown dwarfs to solar - type stars .    in fig .",
    "8 , the sources located above the horizontal broken line can be classified as hps .",
    "their properties are summarized in table .",
    "we found ten hpss which consist of five brown dwarfs and five low - mass stars .",
    "it is most likely that these sources are associated with circumstellar materials which produce highly polarized light through dust scattering .",
    "the existence of circumstellar disk around young brown dwarfs has been indirectly suggested ( e.g. , infrared excess emission , muench et al .",
    "in addition to a few samples revealed by imaging of disks using hst ( bally et al . 2000 ) and outflow detection with spectro - astrometry ( whelan et al .",
    "2005 ) , our five samples serve as @xmath8direct@xmath9 evidence for the existence of disk / envelope system around brown dwarfs ( see also , tamura et al .",
    "2006 ; kusakabe et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the aperture polarimetry of stars provides important information on the direction of magnetic fields .",
    "if we assume the normal grain alignment , i.e. , the spin axis of elongated dust grain align parallel to the magnetic fields ( davis & greenstein 1951 ) , the direction of magnetic fields projected onto the sky can be inferred from the direction of polarization vectors of stars ( @xmath135 , e.g. , weintraub , goodman , & akeson 2000 ) .",
    "though a grain alignment mechanism caused by gas streaming motion ( gold 1952 ) may be the dominant process near or around sources with molecular outflows , we believe our assumption is plausible , because we discuss the structure of magnetic fields not only around each outflow sources but also across the entire surface of ngc 2024 .    in fig .",
    "9 , we show the histogram of polarization position angle , @xmath136 , of stars in ngc 2024 .",
    "it is clear that the stars with @xmath137 % show a peak at the position angle of @xmath138 .",
    "the large scale distribution of magnetic field in ngc 2024 is thus expected to be in the direction of @xmath138 . in the right panel ,",
    "the stars with low polarization ( @xmath139 % ) shows less clear tendency . in the histogram",
    ", we show the number of protostars , pms stars , and dwarf+giant stars in dark gray , gray and white colors , respectively .",
    "there is no large difference in the shape of histograms among three groups with different evolutionary stage .",
    "we show the distribution of polarization vectors for each star in fig .",
    "though the overall distribution of polarization angle is @xmath140 , we found a bend of magnetic fields around the northwest of the star - forming ridge of ngc 2024 .",
    "since the bend of magnetic field orientation is localized on the polarization map , it is most likely that the structure is not associated with ambient material around ngc 2024 but associated with a smaller - scale structure inside the region , i.e. , the star forming ridge .",
    "matthews , fiege , & moriarty - schieven ( 2002 ) studied the magnetic field structure of ngc 2024 based on the sub - mm dust continuum observations using the polarimetry mode of jcmt / scuba .",
    "we overlaid the polarization vector of stars on their polarization map in fig .",
    "vectors from the sub - mm emission polarimetry ( blue lines ) were rotated by 90 degrees so as to be compared with the @xmath141-vector of dichroic polarization in the @xmath30 band ( yellow lines ) .",
    "we futher plotted rotated ( 90 degrees ) polarization vectors taken with 100 @xmath10 m dust emission ( red lines , hildebrand et al .",
    "1995 ; dotson et al .",
    "2000 ) . the background image in fig .",
    "11 is the 850 @xmath10 m dust continuum intensity map taken with jcmt / scuba .",
    "the gray broken line shows the contour of 0.9 jy beam@xmath28 , which corresponds to @xmath142 mag when we use the dust opacity @xmath143 @xmath144 g@xmath145 and dust temperature @xmath146 k. the region enclosed by the gray broken line is too highly obscured to be traced at the near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "we found that the direction of magnetic field obtained from both dust emission ( blue and red lines ) and extinction ( yellow lines ) is generally consistent with each other in the region around and outside the contour of @xmath147 mag .",
    "the agreement between dichroic and dust emission polarizations suggests that dichroic polarization traces well the magnetic field structure if lying dense dusty material is less than or as much as its penetration depth . on the other hand",
    ", dichroic polarization vectors do not show good correlation with those obtained from dust emission inside the contour of @xmath147 mag .",
    "it is a natural result if we consider that the dichroic polarization in the @xmath30 band only trace the magnetic field foreground to the star - forming ridge .",
    "the disagreement between dichroic and dust emission polarizations suggests that magnetic field structure toward the star - forming ridge traced using the dust emission polarimetry is localized in both the plane - of - sky and the line - of - sight direction .",
    "we note that the line - of - sight variation in magnetic field strength ( @xmath12 ) toward the star - forming ridge is also observed by crutcher et al .",
    "( 1999 ) based on the measurements of the zeeman splitting of the absorption lines of hi and oh with very large array ( vla ) . on the basis of the sub - mm dust emission polarimetry data , matthews , fiege , & moriarty - schieven ( 2002 ) explained the magnetic field structure toward the star - forming ridge using two different models ; one is helical magnetic fields surrounding a curved filamentary cloud , and another is magnetic fields swept by the ionization front of the expanding hii region .",
    "it is hard to differentiate the two models based on our near - infrared dichroic polarization data , because the data can not trace the dense region ( @xmath148 mag ) of the star - forming ridge .",
    "it is noteworthy that our result is contrary to the view that the polarization of background starlight in the optical to near - infrared does not trace magnetic fields ( i.e. , grain alignment ) inside cold and dense molecular clouds ( e.g. , goodman et al .",
    "for example , arce et al . (",
    "1998 ) suggested that the dichroic polarization of background stars toward the taurus dark cloud only trace the region up to @xmath149 mag , indicating that the dichroic polarization does not trace magnetic field inside cold dark clouds due to significant depolarization effect .",
    "their criticism may not be the case for other star forming regions where the environment is different ( e.g. , higher temperature k ( gaume , johnston , & wilson 1992 ; mauersberger et al .",
    "1992 ) and @xmath150 k ( 16 k toward the star - forming ridge : mezger et al .",
    "1988 , 18 k toward the orion b south region : johnstone et al .",
    "2006 ) in ngc 2024 . ] ) from those in cold dark clouds .",
    "in addition to the ngc 2024 region , a good consistency in magnetic field structure obtained using dichroic polarization and dust continuum polarization is confirmed in the omc-1 ( houde et al .",
    "2004 ; kusakabe et al .",
    "2006 ) and ngc 2071 ( matthews , fiege , & moriarty - schieven 2002 ; tamura et al .",
    "2006 ) region .",
    "we thus conclude that the dichroic polarization at near - infrared wavelengths is a good tracer of magnetic field structures than previously thought and wide - field near - infrared polarimetry is useful to reveal the magnetic field structures in various star - forming regioins .",
    "we conducted deep and wide - field @xmath0 imaging polarimetry toward ngc 2024 , a massive star - forming region in the orion b cloud .",
    "this is the first imaging polarimetry covering almost all of the hii region as well as embedded young cluster in ngc 2024 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we found a prominent and extended infrared reflection nebula ( irn ) over ngc 2024 on our polarization images .",
    "we constrained the location of illuminating source of the nebula through the analysis of polarization vectors .",
    "a massive star , irs 2b with a spectral type of o8 @xmath1 b2 , is located in the center of the symmetric vector pattern .",
    "we discovered five small - scale irne associated with ysos in our polarization images .",
    "the pattern of polarization vector around the stars appears centrosymmetric indicating that these irne are illuminated by each central star and are responsible for the structure of circumstellar material that produces strongly polarized light through dust scattering .",
    "the polarized intensity of each irn shows a butterfly - shaped emission pattern extending over @xmath151 au , which agrees well with the picture of disk / envelope system around young stars .",
    "3 .   we performed software aperture polarimetry of the 211 point - like sources detected on the stokes @xmath38 images at @xmath0 .",
    "we cataloged 64 highly polarized sources ( hps ) as candidates associated with circumstellar material by selecting the sources with stronger polarizations than estimated from dichroic extinction .",
    "we investigated the fraction of highly polarized sources against the intrinsic luminosity of stars ( @xmath2 mass ) , and found that the source detection rate remains constant from low ( brown dwarfs ) to higher luminosity ( solar - type ) stars .",
    "since most stars in the region are young enough to have circumstellar disks , possible differences in disk lifetime should not affect our statistics .",
    "though a stellar - mass - dependence of disk scale height ( flaring ) is a possible factor to naturally change the detection rate of highly polarized source , our result indicates that the effect is not significant in spite of the theoretical prediction of more flared disks for lower mass stars .",
    "we confirmed the result using our polarimetry of the stars with known spectral types toward ngc 2024 .. 5 .   by comparing our polarimetry with the spectro - photometry by levine et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we found five brown dwarfs with highly polarized integrated emission .",
    "these sources serve as direct evidence of circumstellar material around brown dwarfs .",
    "we investigated the magnetic field structure of ngc 2024 through the measurements of dichroic polarization of point sources .",
    "the position angle of projected magnetic field across the region is generally found to be 110@xmath3 .",

    "<S> we conducted wide - field @xmath0 imaging polarimetry toward ngc 2024 , which is a massive star - forming region in the orion b cloud . </S>",
    "<S> we found a prominent and extended polarized nebula over ngc 2024 , and constrained the location of illuminating source of the nebula through the analysis of polarization vectors . </S>",
    "<S> a massive star , irs 2b with a spectral type of o8 @xmath1 b2 , is located in the center of the symmetric vector pattern . </S>",
    "<S> five small polarized nebulae associated with ysos are discovered on our polarization images . </S>",
    "<S> these nebulae are responsible for the structures of circumstellar matter ( i.e. , disk / envelope systems ) that produce strongly polarized light through dust scattering . for the point - like sources , we performed software aperture polarimetry in order to measure integrated polarizations , with which we detected candidate sources associated with circumstellar material by selecting sources with a larger polarization than that estimated from the extinction of foreground material . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the fraction of highly polarized sources against the intrinsic luminosity of stars ( @xmath2 mass ) , and found that the source detection rate remains constant from low ( brown dwarfs ) to higher luminosity ( solar - type ) stars . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates the relative disk scale - hight is rather independent of the stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> we confirmed the result using our polarimetry of the stars with known spectral types in ngc 2024 . </S>",
    "<S> we found five young brown dwarfs with highly polarized integrated emission . </S>",
    "<S> these sources serve as direct evidence for the existence of disk / envelope system around brown dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the magnetic field structure of ngc 2024 through the measurements of dichroic polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the average position angle of projected magnetic fields across the region is found to be 110@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we found a good consistency in magnetic field structures obtained using near - infrared dichroic polarization and sub - mm / far - infrared dust emission polarization , indicating that the dichroic polarizations at near - infrared wavelengths trace magnetic field structures inside dense ( @xmath4 mag ) molecular clouds . </S>"
