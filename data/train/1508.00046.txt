    "generalized galileon theories attract considerable attention , mostly because they can violate the null energy condition ( nec ) without facing obvious instabilities .",
    "the lagrangians of these theories include second - order derivatives , and yet the equations of motion are second - order differential equations , which is a prerequisite for the absence of ghosts that generically plague higher - derivative theories .",
    "theories of this sort were first proposed back in 1974 by horndeski @xcite , rediscovered in modified form in refs .",
    "@xcite , and relatively recently emerged in refs .",
    "@xcite in the context of the dgp model @xcite .",
    "eventually , these theories were considered in their own right @xcite . since then , galileon theories and their generalizations have been intensely studied in various contexts @xcite .",
    "some generalized galileon theories go under the names of k - mouflage gravity @xcite , kinetic gravity braiding @xcite , and fabfour models @xcite .    among the uses of the generalized galileons are the construction of alternatives to inflation , such as the genesis scenario @xcite and bouncing universe models @xcite , and also an attempt to describe the creation of a universe in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "a review of the theories with the nec violation is given in ref .",
    "many of these applications make use of the lagrangians , which are invariant in minkowski space - time under dilatations @xmath3 the most widely used lagrangians are @xmath4 where @xmath5    besides the stability issues , generalized galileon theories generically face superluminality problem .",
    "superluminal propagation of perturbations about otherwise healthy backgrounds has been argued @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) to signal the absence of lorentz - invariant uv completion ( in other words , a model with this property can not emerge as a low - energy effective theory of some lorentz - invariant quantum theory , valid at all energy scales ) .",
    "superluminal propagation has been found in the dgp model @xcite , in the original galileon model @xcite , and also in a class of bi- and multi - galileon models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , original galileon models admit backgrounds with closed timelike curves @xcite . in the context of the genesis scenario ,",
    "superluminality can be avoided in the vicinity of the relevant background by a judicial choice of the lagrangian functions @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xcite ; however , at least in some cases superluminality is back in the presence of external matter @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the superluminality issue in dilatationally invariant generalized galileon theories ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) in spatially flat flrw backgrounds @xmath8 we allow for the nec violation , and hence impose no restrictions on @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "unlike in previous studies , we do not choose concrete forms of the lagrangian functions @xmath6 , @xmath7 ; the question we ask is whether there exist the functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 , such that the perturbations about _ any stable _ homogeneous background @xmath11 are not superluminal .",
    "by stability we mean the absence of ghosts and gradient instabilities .",
    "our answer is negative : we find that for any @xmath6 and @xmath7 there exist values of @xmath12 and @xmath10 and homogeneous stable solutions to the galileon field equation , such that the galileon perturbations about these backgrounds are superluminal .",
    "this is the main result of this paper .",
    "we emphasize that our analysis does not rule out the possibility that the superluminality of the galileon perturbations may be absent in backgrounds obeying the nec or other energy conditions .",

    "the cases @xmath74 and @xmath75 are to be treated separately .",

    "the domains of stability and regions of subluminality , determined by the conditions ( [ eq : u>0_flrw ] ) , ( [ eq : v>0_flrw ] ) and ( [ eq : u>=v_flrw ] ) , occupy certain regions in the @xmath72 plane .    from eq .",

    "@xmath85 : then @xmath86 , and the parabola ( [ eq : parabola_v=0 ] ) increases or decreases faster than the parabola ( [ eq : parabola_u = v ] ) , depending on the sign of @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 : then @xmath89 , and the parabola ( [ eq : parabola_u = v ] ) increases or decreases faster than the parabola ( [ eq : parabola_v=0 ] ) , depending on the sign of @xmath87 .",

    "[ fig : image1]-[fig : image3 ] it immediately follows that the conditions of stability @xmath58 and @xmath59 do not exclude superluminal propagation @xmath92 if we do not impose any restrictions on @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( in other words , on @xmath12 and @xmath10 ) .",

    "so , by reducing @xmath103 at fixed @xmath15 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , one can always make the relevant values of @xmath12 and @xmath10 arbitrarily small and hence satisfy eq .",
