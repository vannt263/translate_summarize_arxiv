    "the mars code  @xcite is developed for detailed monte carlo modeling of hadronic and electromagnetic cascades in realistic geometry for various accelerator , shielding , detector and space applications .",
    "the recent needs of the rare isotope accelerator , relativistic heavy - ion collider , large hadron colider , and nasa projects was a stimulus to implement heavy - ion collision and transport physics into the mars15 code  @xcite .",
    "the present paper describes in detail the ionization energy loss formalism employed in the code along with comparisons to experimental data and some recommended data .",
    "radiative energy loss of heavy ions ",
    "bremsstrahlung and @xmath1 pair production  is described elsewhere .",
    "the ionization loss is of importance for correct prediction of radiation - induced effects , _",
    "e.g. _ single - event upsets , in microelectronic devices .",
    "the lower energy limit in our stopping power model is equal to 1 kev per nucleon .",
    "in our model we distinguish three energy regions . below 1 mev per nucleon and above 10 mev per nucleon the tabulated data on proton total stopping power from ref .",
    "@xcite and the bethe formalism , respectively , are used in combination with all the corrections described below . between the two energies , a _ mix - and - match",
    "_ procedure is used to perform an interpolation between the approaches .",
    "it should also be noted that the 10-mev limit is identical to the one used when considering the ion effective charge ( see below ) and should be adjusted for some target nuclei to get better appearance of the ionization loss distributions .",
    "the mean ionization energy loss of charged particles heavier than electrons is given by the bethe expression  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the target atomic mass and number , respectively , and the other variables have their usual meaning .",
    "the ionization logarithm , @xmath5 , is presented in the following form : @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the mean excitation energy and density correction , respectively . when neglecting all the corrections @xmath10 and dealing only with the @xmath11 , the expression ( [ bethe ] )",
    "is referred to as the bethe equation .",
    "the corrections @xmath10 described below are to take into account the deviations from the bethe theory for ions at both low and high energies .",
    "lindhard and srensen derived a relativistic expression for electronic stopping power of heavy ions taking into account a finite nuclear size  @xcite .",
    "they used the exact solution to the dirac equation with spherically symmetric potential which describes scattering of a free electron by an ion .",
    "thus , their expression , @xmath12 , provides for the corrections of order higher than @xmath13 to ionization loss of heavy ions in both low and high energy regimes . at high energies the lindhard - srensen ( @xmath14 ) correction replaces the previously developed mott correction and relativistic bloch - ahlen one , while at low energies @xmath12 reduces to the bloch non - relativistic correction  @xcite .    at moderately relativistic energies ( see below )",
    "the following expression derived for point - like ions is valid : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 + \\frac{\\beta^2}{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is a relativistic coulomb phase shift expressed with the argument of the complex gamma function ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and @xmath20 is a parameter used in the summation over partial waves . at higher energies , when @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the ion radius , a modification to the coulomb phase shifts due to a finite nuclear size is not negligible and the expression for @xmath12 gets more complicated from computational standpoint . at ultra - relativistic energies , when @xmath23 , an asymptotic expression for @xmath5 is valid .",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the plasma frequency , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the average density of target electrons .",
    "the value of @xmath28 reveals a weak dependence on target and projectile parameters .    in our model the expressions ( [ ls ] ) and ( [ ls_ultra ] ) , valid for moderately relativistic and ultra - relativistic energies , respectively , are employed . in the intermediate energy region",
    "we interpolate between the two approaches using a _ mix - and - match _ procedure .",
    "the barkas effect , associated with a @xmath29 correction to the stopping power , is well pronounced at low energies .",
    "for example , for a 2-mev proton in gold the effect is responsible for about 8% of ionization energy loss  @xcite .",
    "the correction is due to target polarization effects for low - energy distant collisions and can be accounted for by the following expression : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the function @xmath32 is a ratio of two integrals within a thomas - fermi model of the atom . in our model",
    "we follow the tabulations for the function from refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the original bethe theory is valid when the velocity of the projectile is much higher than that of electrons in target atoms .",
    "shell corrections should be taken into account at lower projectile velocities .",
    "the total shell correction can be presented in the following form  @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is equal to @xmath35 and thus takes into account the contributions from different atomic shells . for @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "we follow the asymptotic expressions and tabulations from refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively , derived with hydrogen - like wave functions .",
    "for all the other atomic shells , up to a combined @xmath38 shell , the scaling procedures developed by bichsel  @xcite are employed .",
    "it is assumed in the scaling that the corrections for the outer shells have the dependence on the projectile velocity similar to that of the outermost shell studied with exact calculations , _ i.e. _ @xmath39 shell in our case .      at low projectile velocities , the effect of electron",
    "capture and loss due to interactions with target atoms should be taken into account as well . at present , the projectile charge distributions that cover a more or less noticeable range of ions , targets , and velocities are not available .",
    "therefore one can deal with various empirical and semi - empirical fitting expressions for the average or , in other words , effective charge , @xmath40 .",
    "the effective charge is to replace the bare projectile charge in all the relevant expressions .    for protons and other singly charged particles",
    "the effective charge is assumed to be equal to the bare charge down to the lower energy limit of the model , 100 kev / a . for @xmath41-particles a special fit by ziegler _",
    "_ @xcite independent of target material is used at all particle energies , @xmath42 .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite above 10 mev / a ; * an energy weighted average between the two energies .    for some target nuclei , however , it is necessary to adjust the upper energy limit to get the stopping power curves with better , without sharp transitions , appearance .",
    "calculated ratios of ion effective charge to bare charge are presented in fig .",
    "[ eff_charge_in_al ] .",
    "the effect of neutralization of the bare projectile charge with captured electrons increases with the target atomic number , being almost negligible for @xmath41-particles at energies above a few kev per nucleon .",
    "here we compare calculated ionization loss to experimental data for several light and heavy ions . for @xmath41-particles at low energies",
    "the overall agreement is very good ( see fig .",
    "[ alpha ] ) .",
    "the deviations from the bethe theory due to the above - mentioned corrections , except for the shell corrections , increase with projectile charge , @xmath52 , at both low and high energies .",
    "therefore , the comparisons for super - heavy ions are interesting and important most of all .    at relativistic energies a comparison to experimental data",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ xe_au ] for a dozen of projectile - target combinations .",
    "one can make the following conclusions from the figure : ( i ) the @xmath14 correction in this case provides for an agreement with experimental data within 2% ; ( ii ) the above - mentioned combination of relativistic bloch , mott , and ahlen ( bma ) corrections gives rise to a systematic underestimation of ionization loss ( 2 - 3% for xe ions ) when compared to the @xmath14 approach ; ( iii ) the difference between the bma and @xmath14 approaches increases with projectile charge .",
    "this confirms that the lindhard - s@xmath53rensen theory is correctly chosen .    a comparison to experimental data for super - heavy ions of lead and uranium is given in fig",
    ".  [ pb_u8 ] .",
    "one can see that the employed _ mix - and - match _ procedure provides for a good , within 10% , agreement with experiment at low energies . for uranium ions",
    "the density effect is well seen at ultra - relativistic energies  the highest ionization loss is observed for the target of the lowest density , _",
    "i.e. _ gaseous argon . for lead ions at ultra - relativistic energies the effect of finite nuclear size , that gives rise to a saturation of ionization loss instead of a logarithmic growth characteristic of a pointlike projectile , is easily recognized .",
    "the experimental data at 160 gev / u by datz _",
    "@xcite corresponds to the highest energy achieved when accelerating heavy ions .      a comparison between the ionization loss calculated within the framework of the described formalism and the data by nist  @xcite is presented in fig .  [ comparison ] for protons and @xmath41-particles .    the data of ref",
    "@xcite are given up to @xmath54 mev and @xmath55 mev / a for protons and @xmath41-particles , respectively .",
    "one can see that the agreement between the mars15 and nist ionization loss is within @xmath56% for protons in the entire energy region .",
    "the agreement is somewhat better than that of mcnp5  @xcite where the difference is about @xmath57% for the energy region from 4 up to @xmath54 mev , being more than @xmath58% below 4 mev .    for @xmath41-particles",
    "the biggest difference , about @xmath58-@xmath59% , is observed below 400 kev / a . the difference is comparable to the disagreement between theory and experiment in the energy region .",
    "as far as the tabulated proton data of ref .",
    "@xcite are used below 1 mev / a in our model , the differences can be attributed to the description of effective charge of @xmath41-particles . above 10 mev per nucleon",
    "the observed difference between the mars15 and nist ionization loss is about @xmath60% .",
    "one can see that approximately a half of the @xmath60% is due to the difference in the description of the proton ionization loss .",
    "the various corrections to the bethe mean ionization loss theory , as implemented in the mars15 monte carlo code , are described .",
    "the comparisons of calculated ionization loss to the nist published values reveal good overall agreement for protons and @xmath41-particles .",
    "the agreement between the current model and experimental data is very good up to the super - heavy ions of lead and uranium .",
    "experimental programs at many accelerator facilities cover wide energy regions .",
    "for example , the rare isotope accelerator is supposed to be operated at energies from a few kev / a up to hundreds of mev / a . to meet such practical demands ,",
