    "ultracold atomic gases are currently attracting a lot of attention from both experimental and theoretical viewpoints . taking advantage of the recent progress in cooling and trapping of neutral atoms @xcite ,",
    "dilute atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite and degenerate fermi gases ( dfgs ) @xcite are now routinely produced at the laboratory . using various techniques ,",
    "space - dependent potentials can be designed almost on demand in these systems .",
    "for example , one can produce periodic @xcite , quasi - periodic @xcite , or random potentials @xcite by using optical means .",
    "for these reasons and due to unique control and analysis possibilities , ultracold gases constitute a favorite playground for revisiting standard problems of condensed matter physics ( cm ) @xcite .",
    "most current experiments with becs lie in the mean - field regime where the bose gas is described by a single wave function , @xmath0 , governed by the ( nonlinear ) gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite . due to the interplay between the kinetic energy term and the interaction term , it is usually difficult to derive the exact solution of this equation .",
    "the importance of interactions can be characterized by the _ healing length _ , @xmath1 , which defines the typical distance below which the spatial variations of @xmath0 significantly contribute to the energy of the bec , _ via _ the kinetic energy term @xcite . in the thomas - fermi regime ( tf ) , i.e. when @xmath1 is significantly smaller than the typical variation scale , @xmath2 , of the potential , @xmath3 , to which the bec is subjected , the kinetic term is negligible and the bec density simply follows the spatial variations of the potential .",
    "although , there is no intrinsic typical variation scale , one can define @xmath2 as @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath5 , the usual tf half size of the condensate and the validity of the tf regime reads @xmath6 . for periodic , quasi - periodic or random potentials ,",
    "@xmath2 is the spatial period or the correlation length ( see section  [ sec : random ] for details ) .",
    "] : @xmath7 in the opposite situation ( @xmath8 ) , the kinetic term should be taken into account and the exact bec wave function usually can not be found analytically .",
    "besides a general interest , the question of determining the bec wave function for an arbitrary ratio @xmath9 has direct applications to the case where @xmath3 is a random potential .",
    "the physics of quantum systems in the presence of disorder is central in cm @xcite , owing to unavoidable defects in ` real - life systems ' .",
    "one of the major paradigms of disordered quantum systems is due to anderson who has shown that the eigenstates of single quantum particles in arbitrary weak random potentials can be localized , i.e. @xmath0 shows an exponential decay at large distances @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have studied the onset of strong or weak localization effects of light waves @xcite and microwaves @xcite .",
    "ultracold matter waves are also widely considered as promising candidates to investigate anderson localization in random @xcite or quasi - random structures @xcite and more generally to investigate the effects of disorder in various quantum systems ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is expected that the dramatic versatility of ultracold gases would allow us for a direct comparison with theoretical studies of quantum disordered systems .",
    "a key peculiarity of becs is that interactions usually can not be neglected and interaction - induced delocalization can compete with disorder - induced localization effects @xcite . generally , the interplay between the kinetic energy , the interactions and the disorder is still a open question that has motivated many works @xcite .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tf0 ] ) that , in the tf regime ( @xmath10 ) , where the interaction forces the wave function to adapt to the random potential , a bec will not localize . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath3 is a _ homogeneous _ random function @xcite , so is the bec wave function , @xmath0 , which therefore , can not decay at large distances .",
    "this has been confirmed in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "the question thus arises as to understand whether , as a naive transcription of the ioffe - regel criterion @xcite would suggest , localization can happen when @xmath11 .    in this paper , we show that this criterion is actually not sufficient for becs at equilibrium if the interactions are non - negligible ( i.e. if @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the size of the system ) .",
    "we indeed show that interaction - induced delocalization still overcomes localization effects even when @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , due to the _ smoothing _ of the random potential @xcite , the effect of disorder turns out to be reduced when @xmath15 increases .    in the following ,",
    "we develop a general formalism based on perturbation theory ( see section  [ sec : smooth ] ) to determine the bec wave function in any given weak potential , @xmath3 , for an arbitrary ratio @xmath9 .",
    "we find that the bec density , @xmath16 , is still given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tf0 ] ) , except that the potential @xmath3 has to be replaced by a _ smoothed potential _ , @xmath17 .",
    "we derive an exact formula for the smoothed potential up to first order in the perturbation series .",
    "we then apply our results to the case where @xmath3 is a 1d homogeneous random potential ( see section  [ sec : random ] ) and derive the statistical properties of the smoothed random potential , @xmath17 . from this , we conclude that an interacting bec remains delocalized , even for @xmath14 ( if @xmath12 ) .",
    "consider a low - temperature bose gas in @xmath18 dimensions with contact atom - atom interactions , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the @xmath18-dimensional interaction parameter . in 3d geometries , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the scattering length @xcite , and @xmath23 is the atomic mass",
    ". low dimensional geometries ( 1d or 2d ) can be realized in ultracold atomic samples using a tight radial confinement , so that the radial wave function is frozen to zero - point oscillations in the form @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the radial coordinate vector . in this case , @xmath26 .",
    "for instance , one finds @xmath27 , for a 2d harmonic radial confinement of frequency @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , the bose gas is assumed to be subjected to a given potential , @xmath3 , with a typical amplitude @xmath29 and a typical variation scale @xmath2 .",
    "possibly , the potential , @xmath3 , may have various length scales . in this case , we assume that @xmath2 is the smallest . assuming weak interactions , i.e. @xmath30 , where @xmath31 the mean density @xcite , we treat the bec in the mean - field approach @xcite and we use the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) : @xmath32 \\psi ( { { \\bf r } } ) ~ , \\label{gpe}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the bec chemical potential , and where the wave function , @xmath0 , is normalized to the total number of condensed atoms , @xmath34 .",
    "note that @xmath0 minimizes the @xmath35-body energy functional so that @xmath0 is necessary a real function ( up to a non - physical uniform phase ) . in 1d and 2d",
    "geometries and in the absence of trapping , no true bec can exist due to significant long - wavelength phase fluctuations @xcite . in this case , no macroscopic wave function , @xmath0 , can be defined . however , because density fluctuations are strongly suppressed in the presence of interactions , the bose gas forms a _ quasicondensate _ @xcite and the density , @xmath36 , can be treated as a classical field .",
    "it turns out that @xmath37 is governed by eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) . therefore , even though we only refer to bec wave functions in the following , our formalism also applies to quasicondensates , after replacing @xmath0 by @xmath37 .      in the simplest situation ,",
    "the healing length of the bec is much smaller than the typical length scale of the potential ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "therefore , the kinetic energy term in the gpe  ( [ gpe ] ) is small and the bec density , @xmath16 , simply follows the spatial modulations of the potential : @xmath39 / { g_{\\tiny d\\textrm{d } } }   \\hspace{0.5 cm } \\textrm{for~ } \\mu > v({{\\bf r } } ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\textrm{and } & & |\\psi ( { { \\bf r}})|^2 = 0 \\hspace{2.6 cm } \\textrm{otherwise}. \\label{tf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this corresponds to the tf regime .",
    "note that for @xmath40 , one has @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the bec wave function at @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the bec wave function itself follows the modulations of the potential @xmath3 .",
    "the situation changes when the healing length is of the order of , or larger than , the typical length scale of the potential ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "indeed , the kinetic contribution limits the smallest variation length of the spatial modulations of a bec wave function to a finite value of the order of the healing length @xcite .",

    "indeed , @xmath64 .",
    "] , @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , @xmath53 can be seen as a _ smoothing function _ with a typical width @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , it should be noted that eq .",
    "( [ dpsildasol ] ) is similar to eq .",
    "( [ dpsitf ] ) , except that the potential @xmath3 which is relevant in the case @xmath38 , changes to the potential @xmath17 for @xmath8 .",
    "the potential @xmath17 is a convolution of @xmath3 with a function which has a typical width @xmath1 and thus corresponds to a _ smoothed potential _ with an amplitude smaller than @xmath29 . in addition , if @xmath2 corresponds to the width of the correlation function of a random potential , @xmath66 , the correlation length of the smoothed random potential , @xmath67 , is of the order of @xmath68,@xmath69 [ for details , see section  [ sec : random ] ] , the variation scale , @xmath70 , corresponds to the period of the potential , and we find @xmath71 .",
    "the potential is indeed smoothed as the amplitude of @xmath67 is smaller than that of @xmath66 .",

    "in this section , we consider a 1d bose gas subjected to a weak homogeneous random potential , @xmath77 , with a vanishing average value ( @xmath78 ) , a standard deviation , @xmath29 , and a spatial correlation length , @xmath2 , significantly smaller than the size of the system .",

    "we consider a situation such that @xmath80 , i.e. the bose gas lies in the mean - field regime , and in the absence of disorder , the interactions dominate over the kinetic energy , so that the bec can be out of the tf regime as defined in section  [ sec : intro ] . ] .",
    "the situation mimics the experimental conditions of ref .",
    "the presence of the harmonic confinement introduces a low - momentum cut - off for the phase fluctuations so that the 1d bose gas forms a true condensate at low temperatures @xcite . in this case , the bec wave function is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the local chemical potential .",
    "this corresponds to an inverted parabolic density profile with a half - size , @xmath83 , where the chemical potential is @xmath84 , with @xmath85 being the extension of the ground state of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "as @xmath86 , it is legitimate to use the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite , i.e. in a region significantly smaller than @xmath87 , the quantities @xmath46 and @xmath88 can be considered as uniform .",

    "in summary , we have presented an analytical technique , based on the perturbation theory , to compute the static wave function of an interacting bec subjected to a weak potential .",
