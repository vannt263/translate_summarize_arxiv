    "strongly correlated systems on geometrically frustrated lattices represent a playground to study many collective quantum phenomena . in this paper",
    ", we consider a particular class of geometrically frustrated lattices , namely lattices which support flat ( i.e.  completely dispersionless ) one - particle bands . the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on such lattices",
    "was examined in refs .",
    "@xcite , although in the context of flat - band ferromagnetism some of these lattices were discussed even earlier @xcite , see also ref .",
    "the flat one - particle band leads to the possibility to localize the corresponding one - particle states within a finite region of a lattice .",
    "considering further many - particle states one may expect that the states with localized particles which are spatially separated from each other are also the eigenstates of the hamiltonian with interaction . under certain conditions",
    "a manifold of localized states may constitute a highly degenerate ground state of the interacting many - particle system and as a result the localized states may dominate the low - temperature thermodynamics .    in the present paper we compare and contrast the consideration of the localized - states effect for the low - temperature thermodynamics for two models , the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model and the one - orbital repulsive hubbard model . for concreteness",
    "we focus on the sawtooth - chain ( @xmath2-chain ) lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( for other lattices see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .     the sawtooth chain .",
    "the exchange ( hopping ) integrals are @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) along the base line and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) along the zigzag line .",
    "the bold valleys show the area occupied by localized magnons ( electrons ) . ]",
    "more specifically , we deal with the antiferromagnetic heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath7 -h\\sum_is_i^z\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the nearest - neighbor exchange integrals @xmath8 , and the hubbard hamiltonian @xmath9 with the on - site repulsion @xmath10 .",
    "we have chosen the sign of hopping terms @xmath11 in the hubbard model ( [ hubb_ham ] ) in order to emphasize the correspondence with the heisenberg model ( [ heis_ham ] ) .",
    "note that the magnetic field @xmath12 in the heisenberg model ( [ heis_ham ] ) plays the same role as the chemical potential @xmath13 in the hubbard model ( [ hubb_ham ] ) .",
    "below we consider the spin model ( [ heis_ham ] ) in strong magnetic fields around the saturation field @xmath0 and the hubbard model ( [ hubb_ham ] ) at values of the chemical potential around a characteristic value @xmath14 , see below .",
    "although both models represent different physics , we will demonstrate that the mathematical consideration exhibits many common features .",
    "the physical properties for the spin system for @xmath15 and for the electron system for @xmath16 will be governed exclusively by either localized magnon or electron states which exist due to lattice geometry .",
    "we begin with the spin model ( [ heis_ham ] ) @xcite .",
    "the lowest excitations in strong magnetic fields @xmath17 are one - magnon states above the fully polarized ferromagnetic state @xmath18 .",
    "the lower of the two branches of the one - magnon dispersion for the sawtooth chain becomes flat for @xmath19 .",
    "for this case one can construct magnon states located in one of the valleys of the sawtooth chain @xmath20 with the energy @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the energy of the state @xmath18 of the spin system ( [ heis_ham ] ) , @xmath23 .",
    "next , we consider the electron model ( [ hubb_ham ] ) @xcite .",
    "the lower one - electron band becomes completely flat for @xmath24 .",
    "the localized one - electron states can be written as @xmath25 and their energy is @xmath26 .",
    "although the one - particle problem for both hamiltonians is quite similar , the many - particle problem will obviously be different .",
    "for the heisenberg system we deal with magnons which are hard - core bosons with nearest - neighbor repulsion ( see eq .",
    "( [ heis_ham ] ) ) , whereas for the hubbard system we deal with interacting spinful electrons which represent a two - component fermionic mixture with one - site repulsion ( see eq .",
    "( [ hubb_ham ] ) ) .",
    "since the localized states are located in a restricted area of the whole lattice , it is clear that many - particle states consisting of several isolated ( no common sites ) occupied valleys are exact eigenstates of both hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "however , for the hubbard model , by contrast to the heisenberg model , the localized states with the same spin polarization may also have common sites . by direct computation",
    "one shows that , e.g. , @xmath27 is indeed an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ hubb_ham ] ) in the two - electron subspace .",
    "further localized two - electron states with one common site can be obtained owing to su(2 ) symmetry of the hubbard model ( [ hubb_ham ] ) by applying operators @xmath28 or @xmath29 on @xmath27 .",
    "this example clearly shows a difference between magnons and electrons conditioned by different particle statistics and interaction .",
    "finally , we notice that a maximal number of localized magnons / electrons which can be put on the sawtooh - chain lattice is @xmath30 for magnons but @xmath31 ( corresponding to quarter filling ) for electrons ; here @xmath32 is the ( even ) number of sites of the sawtooth - chain lattice .    since the localized states are the lowest - energy states in the one - particle subspace , one may also expect that the states with @xmath33 isolated ( independent ) localized particles are the lowest - energy states in the @xmath33-particle subspace ( for rigorous proofs see ref .",
    "we can also confirm this by exact diagonalizations of finite systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , numerics gives evidence that for many lattices these ground states are separated from the higher - energy states by a gap .",
    "another important property of the localized states is their linear independence @xcite .",
    "the energy of the localized @xmath33-particle states is @xmath34 for the heisenberg model and @xmath35 for the electron model . obviously",
    ", the localized - magnon states ( localized - electron states ) are degenerate at the saturation field @xmath36 ( at a characteristic value of the chemical potential @xmath37 ) .",
    "consider now the spin model in a strong magnetic field @xmath12 around the saturation field @xmath38 .",
    "using the ensemble with fixed @xmath39 we find the following contribution of the localized - magnon states to the partition function @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the degeneracy of the states with @xmath33 independent localized magnons .",
    "thermodynamic quantities follow by the standard relations : @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( entropy ) , @xmath44 ( specific heat ) etc .",
    "similarly , we consider the electron model at a value of the chemical potential around @xmath1 .",
    "using the ( grand - canonical ) ensemble with fixed @xmath45 we find the following contribution of the localized - electron states to the partition function @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the degeneracy of states with @xmath33 independent localized electrons .",
    "thermodynamic quantities follow by the standard relations : @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( entropy ) , @xmath50 ( average number of electrons ) etc .",
    "we note that the specific heat @xmath51 at constant @xmath33 equals zero for @xmath52 .",
    "the central problem now is the calculation of the degeneracy @xmath53 for localized magnon and electron states .",
    "this can be done using a mapping of localized states onto spatial configurations of hard dimers on a simple chain . for the spin system",
    "it can be shown that @xmath54 , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the number of spatial configurations of @xmath33 hard dimers on a chain of @xmath57 sites @xcite .",
    "for the electron system it can be shown that @xmath58 , @xmath59 , but @xmath60 @xcite . substituting @xmath61 and @xmath62 into eqs .",
    "( [ partit_ma ] ) and ( [ partit_el ] ) we obtain a grand - canonical partition function of one - dimensional hard dimers , which can be calculated using the transfer - matrix method . as a result , we obtain the low - temperature thermodynamics for both models .    in fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] is due to the manifold of localized states .",
    "obviously , the localized - state picture excellently reproduces exact diagonalization data for finite systems in the low - temperature regime for small deviation from the values @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we note that localized - state thermodynamics implies an enhanced magnetocaloric effect @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the localized - state effects for two strongly interacting models ( antiferromagnetically interacting heisenberg spins and standard hubbard electrons ) on the sawtooth - chain lattice which supports a flat one - particle band . under certain conditions ( values of external magnetic field or chemical potential )",
    "the localized states in both models govern the low - temperature thermodynamics .",
    "several remarks are in order here .",
    "the large-@xmath78 limit of the hubbard hamiltonian ( [ hubb_ham ] ) yields the @xmath79@xmath80 model .",
    "therefore , it is not astonishing that the localized - electron states are also eigenstates of the @xmath79@xmath80 hamiltonian and they are the ground states for @xmath52 electrons for small exchange couplings @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "some prominent peculiarities of low - temperature thermodynamic quantities conditioned by localized states remain stable to small deviations from the ideal lattice geometry , increasing chances to observe the examined properties in solid - state systems @xcite .",
    "although we focus here on one representative example , the sawtooth - chain lattice , the elaborated scheme can also be applied to spin and electron models on other lattices @xcite .",
