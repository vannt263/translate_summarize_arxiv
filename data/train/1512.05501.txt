    "the paper @xcite introduced a new @xmath2 theory to study compactness of singular integral operators .",
    "its main result provided necessary and sufficient conditions for operators associated with classical caldern - zygmund kernels to be compact on @xmath3 for all @xmath4 .",
    "this characterization was expressed in terms of three conditions : the decay of the derivative of the kernel along the direction of the diagonal , an appropriate weak compactness condition , and the membership of properly constructed @xmath2 and @xmath5 functions to the space @xmath6 . here",
    ", the latter space is defined as the closure in @xmath7 of the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity .",
    "later , in @xcite , the endpoint case of compactness from @xmath8 into @xmath6 was obtained .",
    "we note that , although the results in the two above - mentioned papers were proven in the context of functions defined on @xmath9 , the results and techniques developed also hold in the multi - dimensional setting .",
    "see , for instance , the preprint @xcite which contains the proof of a global @xmath10 theorem for compactness of singular integrals in @xmath11 .",
    "a natural question is whether one can obtain the two remaining endpoint results , namely , compactness from @xmath12 into @xmath0 and from @xmath0 into @xmath1 .",
    "a little bit of thought shows that the former case is an immediate consequence of @xcite and schauder s theorem , which states that an operator between two banach spaces , @xmath13 , is compact if and only if the same holds true for @xmath14 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the point of this paper is to prove that the latter endpoint result also holds .",
    "although both results are the natural extensions of the classical endpoint theorems for boundedness , the method used to prove compactness from @xmath15 to @xmath16 is very different from the standard one .",
    "it is true that the demonstration follows the same general scheme and shares identical initial steps as in the proof of boundedness .",
    "however , the standard reasoning comes to a halt when applied to the orthogonal projection operator , which is an element completely absent in the classical proof .",
    "this difficulty forces one to perform the operator analysis in a different way , more in accordance with the ideas carried out to show compactness at the non - endpoint case @xcite .",
    "since the current project is the continuation of @xcite , we often cite this paper for detailed references about the notation and the definitions we use , and also for proofs of those results that we merely state . and yet , we intend to present a paper as self - contained as possible .",
    "we say that @xmath17 is a cube in @xmath11 if the quantity @xmath18 remains constant for all indices @xmath19 . for every cube @xmath20",
    "we denote its centre by @xmath21 , its side length by @xmath22 , and its volume by @xmath23 . for any @xmath24 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath25 the cube such that @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "accordingly , we also write @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we denote by @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , the @xmath32-norm in @xmath11 and by @xmath33 the modulus of a complex number .",
    "hopefully , this notation will not cause any confusion with the one we use for the volume of a cube .    given two cubes @xmath34 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath35 any cube with minimal side length containing @xmath36 and write its side length by @xmath37 .",
    "if there is more than one cube satisfying these conditions , we will simply select one and refer to it as @xmath35 regardless of the choice .",
    "we note that if @xmath38 , @xmath39 , with @xmath40 intervals in @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the length of @xmath44 , the smallest interval containing @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , we have the following equivalences @xmath47    we also define the relative distance between @xmath48 and @xmath49 by @xmath50 which is comparable to @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the smallest number of times the larger cube needs to be shifted a distance equal to its side length so that it contains the smaller one .",
    "note that from the above , we have @xmath53    we also define the eccentricity of @xmath48 and @xmath49 to be @xmath54    finally , we say that a cube @xmath48 is dyadic if @xmath55 for some @xmath56 , and denote by @xmath57 and @xmath58 the families of all cubes and all dyadic cubes in @xmath11 , respectively .
