    "the discovery of superconductivity in the iron pnictides is one of the most exciting recent developments in condensed matter physics.@xcite although most work has been directed at understanding the superconducting pairing ,  @xcite the unusual antiferromagnetic ( afm ) state of the parent compounds has also attracted much attention.@xcite this state appears to be a metallic spin - density wave ( sdw ) , with relatively small staggered magnetic moment at the fe sites  @xcite and significant reconstruction of the fermi surface below the nel temperature @xmath0.@xcite _ ab initio _ calculations have highlighted the nesting of the electron - like and hole - like fermi surfaces as a crucial ingredient for the sdw ,  @xcite and neutron - scattering experiments reveal signatures of itinerant magnetism.@xcite this has led many theorists to interpret the sdw in the pnictides as a new manifestation of an old problem : the excitonic instability of a multiband metal.@xcite    the excitonic instability was first proposed in the context of the semimetal - insulator transition.@xcite assuming electron and hole fermi pockets separated by a nesting vector @xmath1 , the coulomb repulsion between the two bands can equivalently be viewed as an attractive interaction between electrons in one band and holes in the other .",
    "depending upon the degree of the nesting , this causes the condensation of interband electron - hole pairs ( excitons ) with relative wave vector @xmath2 and opens a gap in the single - particle excitation spectrum .",
    "although excitonic semimetal - insulator transitions are rare ,  @xcite this scenario has been generalized to account for the presence of additional non - nested fermi surfaces.@xcite it is widely accepted that such an excitonic instability is responsible for the metallic sdw state in chromium and its alloys ,  @xcite and the excitonic scenario has had notable success in reproducing the spin dynamics above @xmath0 and the doping dependence of the phase diagram.@xcite on the other hand , while it qualitatively captures the spin dynamics below @xmath0 , it nevertheless overestimates the low - temperature spin - wave velocity by a factor of about 2.@xcite    the interband interaction responsible for the excitonic instability is only one of many possible interaction terms for a multiband system . in most theoretical studies ,",
    "however , the intraband interaction is neglected on the basis that it does not directly play a role in causing interband exciton formation .",
    "the intraband coulomb repulsion is nevertheless likely to be at least as large as its interband counterpart , and one might expect that it could give rise to competing magnetic phases or influence the spin dynamics .",
    "these questions are of fundamental interest , since the excitonic spin - density wave ( esdw ) is a key concept in the theory of multiband antiferromagnets .",

    "we specialize to two dimensions for consistency with refs .  , and also to make contact with the sdw in the iron pnictides .",
