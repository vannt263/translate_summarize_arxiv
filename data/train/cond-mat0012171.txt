    "the fluid of pointlike spinless charged bosons embedded in a uniform neutralizing background has attracted attention in the literature mainly as a model in quantum statistical mechanics , which is complementary to the physically more relevant fermionic gas of electrons@xcite .",

    "a number of theoretical and computational studies have been addressed to the three - dimensional charged - boson fluid ( 3d - cbf ) at zero temperature .",
    "the properties of main interest for the theory have been the ground - state energy and structure and the static and dynamic dielectric response .",
    "the early theoretical work was concerned with evaluating the ground - state energy and the elementary excitations in the weak coupling ( high density ) limit@xcite . both variational calculations based on jastrow - feenberg wave functions@xcite and self - consistent treatments of correlations@xcite",
    "have subsequently been used to evaluate the intermediate and strong coupling regime .",
    "quantal monte carlo studies of the 3d - cbf@xcite have covered the whole range of coupling strength up to the regime of wigner crystallization driven by the coulomb repulsions .",

    "a condensate is present in the ground state , but its density vanishes at finite temperature .",

    "the local properties of the quasicondensate are the same as those of a genuine condensate , so that it turns to the latter as the phase correlation length starts to exceed the dimensions of the sample .",
