    "the ns candidate 1rxs j141256.0@xmath0792204 , dubbed `` calvera '' @xcite , was selected from the _ rosat _",

    "a deep radio pulsar search showed that it is radio quiet @xcite .",
    "it was not until a pair of _ xmm - newton _  observations was obtained with high time resolution that @xcite discovered 59  ms pulsations from calvera .",
    "the classification of calvera among the families of nss is not yet understood .",
    "its x - ray spectrum is characterized as a blackbody of temperature @xmath2  kev , or a hydrogen atmosphere of @xmath3  0.1 kev @xcite .",
    "two - temperature models provide a better fit , and the surface temperature must be nonuniform because pulsations are seen .",
    "calvera s properties distinguish it from seven isolated nss ( inss : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also discovered by _ rosat _ , which are slowly rotating ( @xmath4  s ) , cooler nss in the solar neighborhood .",
    "x - ray timing and spectroscopy and kinematic studies of the inss indicates that they have strong magnetic fields , @xmath5  g , and are @xmath6  years old @xcite .",
    "calvera is at least twice as hot as the inss , indicating an age @xmath7  yr according to minimal ns cooling curves @xcite . even though it is at high galactic latitude @xmath8 , if calvera is a passively cooling ns it must be close to its birth place in the disk , implying a maximum distance of a few hundred parsecs .",
    "depending on the x - ray spectral model fitted , the column density is consistent with a range of values that does not further constrain the distance .",
    "based on the spectral fits of @xcite , the bolometric flux is uncertain by about a factor of 2 , and the luminosity is @xmath9 erg  s@xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the distance in units of 300  pc .",
    "calvera remains radio quiet even after a deeper search for radio pulsations at 59  ms @xcite .",
    "analyzing data from the _ fermi _  large area telescope ( lat ) , @xcite claimed that 59  ms pulsations are detected from 1rxs j141256.0@xmath0792204  at @xmath12  mev .",
    "apart from the marginal significance of the detection , this result is surprising because their ephemeris requires no frequency derivative over the 21 month time span analyzed .",
    "their effective @xmath13 upper limit is @xmath14 hz  s@xmath10 , implying spin - down power @xmath15 erg  s@xmath10 , characteristic age @xmath16  yr , and magnetic field strength @xmath17  g. here we assume a moment of inertia",

    "these timing parameters imply that 1rxs j141256.0@xmath0792204  is not just a passively cooling ns , but is converting a large fraction of its meager spin - down power into @xmath1-rays .",

    "the precise agreement between the frequencies at the @xmath33 fractional level argues against any orbital motion ( but see below ) , which is supported by the absence of an optical counterpart .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the precision of the two frequency measurements is insufficient to join these widely spaced observations coherently and obtain more precise timing parameters .",
    "since the measured frequencies agree within their errors , we can only derive an upper limit on the spin - down rate . using the data in table  [ tab1 ] , we calculate an upper limit on the frequency derivative by propagating the errors and dividing the difference of the frequencies by the time interval between the observations .",

    "evidently the ephemeris does not phase - align the x - ray pulse profiles . ]    using _ fermi _  lat data , @xcite claimed to detect @xmath1-ray pulsations from 1rxs j141256.0@xmath0792204  by searching coherently a 21 month span from 2008 august to 2010 april using the @xmath31 test .",
    "although no imaging detection of a source at this position was reported , searching both @xmath39 and @xmath40 around the x - ray measured values , they found a peak power @xmath41 with the following ephemeris : epoch @xmath42 mjd , @xmath43  hz , @xmath44 hz  s@xmath10 .",
    "since this ephemeris spans the dates of the _ xmm - newton _  observations in 2009 august and october , it can be used fold the x - ray photons , and the pulse profiles so derived should align in phase .",
    "@xcite did not perform this test .",
    "the result is shown in figure  2 .",
    "the test fails because the light curves folded according to the trial ephemeris are out of phase by 0.35  cycles ( 21  ms ) . as we discuss below , this is much larger than the maximum @xmath45  ms uncertainty due to the 5.7  ms ccd frame time .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the ephemeris represents a noise peak in the power spectrum of ( probably ) background photons , not a true detection of pulsations",
    ".    this test does not involve the phasing of the @xmath1-ray pulse with respect to the x - ray pulse , nor is it sensitive to uncertainties on the _ fermi_ephemeris parameters .",
    "this is because the coherent ephemeris is a _ phase _ ephemeris .",
    "it specifies the phase of the pulsar @xmath46 at all times during the span of the ephemeris , and the _ xmm - newton _  observations are contained well within that span .",
    "the quoted _ fermi _  uncertainties , @xmath47  hz and @xmath48 hz  s@xmath10 , can contribute only tiny drifts in relative phase , @xmath49 cycles and @xmath50 cycles , respectively , over the @xmath51  day interval between the x - ray observations .",
    "even these are upper limits , as the errors are covariant .",
    "our analysis does depend on the stability of epic pn timing in small window mode .",
    "considerable effort has gone into calibrating the relative and absolute timing of this particular mode and maintaining the accuracy of the photon time assignments in the processing chain .",
    "the absolute accuracy of the _ xmm - newton _  clock is better than 0.6  ms @xcite .",
    "we have carried out extensive investigations of pulsars using the pn small window mode , and empirical checks for consistency show that the absolute times are at least as accurate as the @xmath45  ms uncertainty due to the 5.7  ms ccd frame time .",
    "we summarize two of these studies here : a coherent ephemeris for the 237  ms pulsar geminga using 10 _ xmm - newton _  observations over a span of 7 years has phase residuals of 2  ms .",
    "we have used it to demonstrate the stable phase relationship between the x - ray and @xmath1-ray pulse of geminga with _ agile _",
    "@xcite and _ fermi _",
    "@xcite to @xmath52  ms .",
    "these agree with earlier results comparing egret and _ asca _ @xcite . in an extensive campaign on the 105  ms pulsar psr j1852 + 0040 @xcite , 16 _ xmm - newton _  observations and seven _ chandra_observations ( with time resolution 3  ms ) spanning 4.8 years",
    "are fitted by a quadratic phase ephemeris with rms phase residuals of 3.4  ms .",
    "this demonstrates that _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  agree in absolute time to better than 3  ms .",
    "our analysis does not make use of the epic mos detector timing data that were obtained simultaneously with the pn .",
    "@xcite noted that the mos detector s timing mode is not well calibrated , and they did not use it for timing analysis .",
    "we address here reasons why one might consider the _ fermi _  detection of calvera to be real despite our negative evidence .",
    "first , @xcite suggest that actually a more conservative upper limit on the frequency derivative from _ fermi _  should be allowed , @xmath53 hz  s@xmath10 .",
    "still , its effect over the 40 day interval between x - ray observations would be negligible , and it would not change the outcome of our x - ray phase comparison .",
    "it is not clear why they entertain this possibility , since such a value would contribute 1.5 extra cycles of rotation over the 21 month span of their ephemeris .",
    "if @xmath40 actually turns out to be @xmath54 hz  s@xmath10 , it would be a different ephemeris from the published one , and the claimed detection would be spurious .",
    "for that matter , the frequency of the pulsar could also turn out to differ by more than one fourier bin ( @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the 21 month span of the _ fermi _  data ) from the published _ fermi _  ephemeris , and still be consistent with the x - ray measured value . in this case",
    "as well , the claimed @xmath1-ray detection is just noise .",
    "second , it may be argued that , while the fitted ephemeris corresponds to the average values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 over the time span , there could be timing noise that smears the pulse , while the signal is not strong enough to fit such trends with higher order terms . under this hypothesis , the phase drift between the two x - ray observations is a manifestation of timing noise .",
    "we consider this unlikely because the fitted @xmath40 is already consistent with zero .",
    "any detectable timing noise would vary the sign of @xmath40 , which has not been seen in any isolated pulsar apart from glitch discontinuities .",
    "a phase drift of 0.35 cycles over 40 days would require an effective @xmath57 hz  s@xmath10 over this time , almost 500 times the mean value of @xmath58 hz  s@xmath10 .",
    "this seems unlikely , as does a glitch that is not also detected in the @xmath1-ray timing .",
    "no pulsar with @xmath59  myr has been observed to glitch @xcite .    as an alternative to timing noise",
    ", it may be hypothesized that the x - ray phase shift over 40 days is evidence of binary motion , i.e , a planetary companion .",
    "such an explanation would require the orbital period to be much less than the 21 month span of the _ fermi _  ephemeris , but longer than the durations of the individual _ xmm - newton _  pointings , which are 5.5 hours and 7.7 hours , respectively .",
    "we consider that @xmath60 covers the applicable range . under the binary hypothesis",
    ", the projected radius @xmath61 of the ns orbit falls in a narrow range .",
    "the roemer delay @xmath62 must be @xmath63  ms to produce the phase shift , but @xmath64  ms so as not to smear out the supposed @xmath1-ray pulsations . combining these requirements , for @xmath65 we find that @xmath66 this corresponds to a minimum planet mass of @xmath67 earth masses , and a maximum of @xmath68 jupiter masses , the latter for @xmath69 day .",
    "more likely the @xmath1-ray ephemeris is spurious , and the 0.35 cycle phase shift is a random number , not evidence of a planet .",
    "other aspects of the @xcite analysis are unusual . by their own description , the @xmath1-ray signal is marginal , with @xmath41 , and its significance depends on the number of independent trials in the search .",
    "the trials can be assessed using the x - ray uncertainties on the timing parameters in section  2 , @xmath70  hz and @xmath71 hz  s@xmath10 , and the @xmath72 month span of the _ fermi _  data .",
    "the number of independent trials in the two - dimensional _ fermi _  search should be at least @xmath73 for frequency , and @xmath74 for frequency derivative . these represent a search of independent frequencies in the @xmath75 interval around the _ xmm - newton _  measured @xmath39 , and independent frequency derivatives ranging from zero to the @xmath76 limit , i.e. , only negative @xmath40 .",
    "if so , the expected number of noise peaks of power @xmath77 , obtained by multiplying the @xmath78 trials by the single - trial probability , @xmath79 , is of order unity .",
    "the oversampling by a factor of 10 that was performed further reduces the statistical significance .",
    "the crux of their argument must be that , since the value of @xmath40 in the discovered signal is consistent with zero , almost no trials in @xmath40 were needed to find it .",
    "only this would allow that the chance probability of the result is @xmath80 .",
    "but they do not display the power spectrum for the complete search .",
    "instead , they say that they did not find false detections over a range of parameters much wider than the x - ray uncertainties .",
    "it is not stated what they consider a false detection , and we are not shown the values of the highest peaks in the extended search . therefore , we do nt know what to make of this argument . finally , the absence of the @xmath1-ray source in a spatial image is also worrisome , especially since the position is at high galactic latitude with minimal confusing diffuse background .",
    "so there is no supporting evidence of a source at this position .",
    "is similar to their value of 26.2 .",
    "the two - dimensional search in @xmath39 and @xmath40 was projected onto one dimension in this plot . ]",
    "for completeness , we extracted and reduced _ fermi _  data using the same event filtering and methods described by @xcite .",
    "we first extracted the identical 631 day time span , 2008 august 4  2010 april 27 , recovering 2750 photons , similar to their 2518 photons . a @xmath31 search covering their @xmath81 range of _ fermi _  frequency derivative recovers the candidate peak at @xmath82 , as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the peak power , @xmath83 , is consistent with their value of 26.2 .",
    "we then applied the same method to the full data set now available , comprising 4764 photons collected up to 2011 may 19 ( 33 months ) .",
    "this increases the number of photons by 73% .",
    "a search of the same ephemeris parameters does not yield increased power at the claimed frequency .",
    "rather , the peak previously seen is reduced to @xmath84 ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) , indicating that it was just noise .",
    "we regard this result as direct support of our inference that the supposed _",
    "detection was not real .",
    "a wider search of thousands of trials in @xmath40 is not meaningful , for the reasons discussed above .",
    "is no longer significant . ]",
    "in summary , the incorrect phasing of the x - ray observations of calvera using the claimed _ fermi _  ephemeris led us to conclude that the @xmath1-ray detection is probably spurious .",
    "then , extending the _ fermi _  analysis from 21 to 33 months rendered the candidate signal insignificant . here",
    "we comment on the implications for the nature of calvera of the less restrictive @xmath13 limit @xmath34 hz  s@xmath10 from x - ray timing .",
    "the corresponding limits on spin - down properties , @xmath35 erg  s@xmath10 , @xmath36  yr , and @xmath37  g , allow three scenarios .",
    "first , calvera could be an ordinary pulsar with magnetic field strength @xmath85 or more below the mean of the birth distribution @xcite .",
    "second , it could be a mildly recycled pulsar , formerly in a binary system with a high - mass companion that has since undergone a supernova explosion . in this case",
    ", its magnetic field strength would be intermediate between those of fully recycled ( millisecond ) pulsars , and ordinary pulsars .",
    "third , it could be an `` orphaned cco '' as we describe next .",
    "the second and third scenarios were also addressed by @xcite .",
    "the class of central compact objects ( ccos ) in supernova remnants comprises @xmath86 nss , three of which are detected pulsars with @xmath87  s. see @xcite and @xcite for observations and overview of related theory .",
    "the cco pulsars have weak dipole fields , in the range @xmath88  g , and negligible spin - down power in comparison with their bolometric x - ray luminosities of @xmath89 erg  s@xmath10 .",
    "these @xmath90  yr old nss must represent a significant fraction of ns births .",
    "after their host supernova remnants dissipate , orphaned ccos will remain in the region of @xmath91 space where they were born , which is also where the supposed mildly recycled pulsars are found @xcite .",
    "an orphaned cco would be distinguished from a single , recycled pulsar by its residual thermal x - ray luminosity .",
    "an orphaned cco could be recognized as a thermal x - ray source , depending on its distance , while it is up to @xmath92  yr old ( not the characteristic age , which is orders of magnitude larger than the real age of a cco ) .",
    "the known ccos have x - ray temperatures in the range @xmath93  kev .",
    "calvera , being cooler than this and less luminous than a young cco by a order of magnitude or more , could be an evolved stage of a passively cooling cco .",
    "it is possible , therefore , that 1rxs j141256.0@xmath0792204  is the first orphaned cco to be recognized .",
    "these scenarios can be distinguished by the spin - down rate of the pulsar .",
    "if @xmath94  g and @xmath95  yr , calvera is probably an ordinary pulsar . if @xmath96  g and @xmath97  yr , it could be an orphaned cco younger than @xmath98 , or a spin - powered , mildly recycled pulsar .",
    "if @xmath99  g and @xmath100 erg  s@xmath10 , its spin - down power is probably insufficient to heat its surface , and an orphaned cco would be required instead of a mildly recycled pulsar to explain its x - ray luminosity and temperature . even though calvera is not ( yet ) detected in @xmath1-rays ,",
    "an x - ray timing study is straightforward , and should detect its spin - down in @xmath101  yr even if its magnetic field strength is only @xmath102  g.    we thank eric gotthelf for discussions and assistance with the data .",
    "this investigation is based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa ."
