    "it is suited for a parallel study of both abelian and non - abelian gauge fields coupling to the boundary of the manifold @xcite .",
    "the formalism can be used to give meaning to the notion of a matrix valued d - brane position .",
    "secondly , we comment on a simple observation relevant for the issue of quantum equivalence of t - dual @xmath0-models on manifolds with boundary . to give to the results gained by formal manipulations with the functional integral or by classical canonical transformations an exact status",
    ", one has to perform a careful analysis of the renormalization properties .",
    "for @xmath0-models without boundary it has been shown that beyond 1-loop order the buscher rules @xcite require modifications @xcite .",
    "concerning the gauge field sector common folklore seems to take the absence of such corrections for granted .",
    "this is based on the remarkable duality property of born - infeld actions @xcite . in section 3",
    "we will point out that in the d - brane case the relation between the functional derivatives of the born - infeld action and the @xmath1-functions is an inhomogeneous one .",
    "this is in collision with @xcite and implies the need for a more detailed study of the problem in the gauge field sector , too .",

    "the integrand of the functional integral appears not in the standard form as an exponential of a local action . to handle this complication",

    "in contrast to @xmath84 and @xmath85 it is not induced from target space fields and does not `` feel '' the embedding .",
    "now the problem connected with ( [ 33]),([34 ] ) is due to the presence of an inhomogeneity ( the curvature term ) in the otherwise linear relation between the @xmath1-functions and the functional derivatives of the bi - action .",
    "we no longer can claim the equivalence of the vanishing of the @xmath1-functions and the stationarity of @xmath63 .",
    "as far as one is interested in the equivalence of bi stationarity and the conformal invariance condition of the d - brane model there is still a way out .",
    "the weyl anomaly coefficients are given by the @xmath1-functions plus some additive terms @xcite usually contributing in higher orders only . while the @xmath1 s are not diffeomorphism invariant the weyl anomaly coefficients are invariant under diffeomorphisms .",
    "hence as long as these additive terms are not calculated one should state conformal invariance as the vanishing of the @xmath1-functions up to terms which can be generated by a diffeomorphism . the disturbing term in ( [ 33 ] ) has the form of a product of @xmath86 times a vector .",
    "therefore , it can be generated by a combination of a diffeomorphism and a gauge transformation .",
    "of course a final statement can be made only after a calculation of the difference between the weyl anomaly coefficients and the corresponding @xmath1-functions has been done .",
