    "it is known that baryons can emerge as solitons in an effective meson field theory . in these models",
    "the baryon number is identified with a topological charge . since this identification",
    "was originally made by t.h.r.skyrme @xmath0 years ago @xcite , the soliton solution is called the skyrmion .",
    "skyrmion models provide a useful way of analysing the monopole catalysis of proton decay , as originally pointed out by callan and witten @xcite .",
    "the decay process can be allowed because , in the presence of a monopole , the baryon number is no longer equal to the topological charge of the meson field .",
    "in fact , there exist non - topological solitons with non - zero baryon number which can decay without topological problems .",
    "skyrmions have also been used to examine the absorbtion of baryons by microscopic black holes @xcite .",
    "solutions representing skyrmions partially absorbed by schwarzschild black holes provide a semiclassical framework to study the absorption rate of a proton by a black hole of comparable size . however , this process is rather insignificant because black holes of the size of a proton have large fluxes of hawking radiation which swamp the proton decay .    in this paper",
    "we analyse black hole solutions with skyrmion hair and magnetic charge , providing the semiclassical framework in which to study monopole black hole catalysis of proton decay .",
    "the flux of hawking radiation from these holes is less than ordinary holes and even vanishes in extremal cases @xcite .",
    "the black hole mass for abelian monopoles has the lower bound @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a rationalised electric charge in gaussian units determined from the dirac quantisation condition @xmath3 as @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the planck mass which is approximately @xmath6 .",
    "this kind of small black hole may be considered to have been created in the early universe and remain as a stable relic today .",
    "more complicated monopole solutions are also possible in grand unified theories , depending on the details of the higgs sector @xcite , but we will restrict attention to the simplest case .    in the extreme case , @xmath7 , we find the remarkable situation that multiple black hole solutions are possible in which the gravitational , electromagnetic , and strong forces between the monopoles are all in balance . in this respect the solitons behave in an analagous way to bps monopole solutions in the yang - mills - higgs system @xcite .",
    "we find that the non - topological skyrmion solutions are stable within the confines of our model .",
    "this is , in part , due to the fact that we have not included the electron .",
    "the black hole can not swallow the proton whole because this would tip it over the extremal limit .",
    "light , charged particles are therefore needed to carry away the proton s charge when it decays .",
    "we discuss a way of including this effect in the conclusion .",
    "we shall consider models with a charged @xmath8 meson field @xmath9 . the lagrangian is based on a gauged version of the original skyrmion lagrangian @xcite .",
    "it should be regarded as a minimal form of the meson effective action , since extra terms could also be included .",
    "however , some of the terms in the lagrangian which couple the chiral field to electromagnetism can be deduced from current algebra techniques and were constructed by callan and witten @xcite .",

    "the usual skyrmion has a magnetic moment which would interact with a magnetic monopole and break the spherical symmetry .",
    "we use instead a non - topological ansatz for the chiral field , @xmath22 despite the fact that this field is made up of neutral pions and commutes with the charge matrix @xmath13 , it has a non - zero total electric and baryonic charge due to the effects of anomalies , as we shall see in the next section .",

    "when combined , @xmath33 the extrema of the action occur when the electric field is given by @xmath34 this situation is reminisent of the factorisation of the lagrangian that occurs for a bps monopole @xcite .",
    "the electric field implies a total charge @xmath35 or asymptotically @xmath36 and the @xmath37 solution can therefore be interpreted as a proton .",
    "if a black hole appears in the background , the inner boundary condition for the field @xmath38 should be imposed not at the origin but at the event horizon @xmath39 .",

    "this configuration represents a proton tightly bound to the black hole . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath38 takes some positive value at the horizon the baryon number is not an integer and the skyrmion carries fractional baryon number and electric charge .",
    "this configuration will be interpreted as a proton partially swallowed by the black hole . in particular",
    ", @xmath42 means that the black hole has swallowed a whole proton leaving nothing outside the horizon .",
    "it is interesting to observe that , while the baryon number disappears inside the horizon , the electric charge of the black hole can still be measured outside , turning the monopole black hole into a dyon black hole .",
    "therefore , while the baryon number conservation is violated , charge conservation is not violated .",
    "in the extremal case we can obtain a general solution based on the papapetrou - majumbar metrics @xcite .",
    "we begin with the background metric fixed and later generalise to solve the full einstein equations with chiral matter .",
    "the papapetrou majumbar metrics have the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the ordinary euclidean distance from the point mass @xmath46 located in three dimensional space .",
    "we also associate these point masses with magnetic charges @xmath47 , and the magnetic field @xmath48 the matter lagrangian obtained earlier ( [ lag1 ] ) has the form @xmath49 where we will set @xmath50 the skyrme field equation obtained from the lagrangian on this background becomes @xmath51 we loose no generality by taking equal charges @xmath52 .",
    "the solution with baryon number @xmath53 is then @xmath54 where @xmath55 since @xmath56 , we can use @xmath57 for the pion model .    for a single black hole ,",

    "this gives @xmath65 the total mass in the chiral field is much less than one baryon mass per mass point .",
    "we can see how it is energetically favourable for a free skyrmion to change its internal configuration from the original skyrme form to the simpler form used here when it comes into contact with a black hole monopole .",
    "the topological description of this transformation for a single monopole is exactly as described in reference @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see that the electrostatic energy cancells due to the factorisation occuring in the lagrangian ( [ lag2 ] ) .",
    "the chiral field mass is independent of the separation of the holes and therefore there are no forces between then .",
    "this is similar to situation for bps monopole solutions @xcite , and suggests that there is a solution of the full einstein - matter system .",
    "this existence of this solution will now be demonstrated .",
    "the spatial part of the einstein tensor for the matric ( [ papmaj ] ) is @xmath66 and the ricci scalar is @xmath67 substituting the einstein tensor for the lagrangian ( [ masslag ] ) into the einstein equations gives @xmath68 these make up a complete system of equations when we include the maxwell equation @xmath69 the second einstein equation implies that @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are all parallel . we therefore impose a condition @xmath73 , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 the system of equations becomes equivalent to an ordinary differential equation with independent parameter @xmath76 , @xmath77 where @xmath78 the horizon corresponds to @xmath79 and the far region to @xmath80 .",
    "the horizon must therefore be at a critical point of the first order system corresponding to ( [ sos ] ) .",
    "there is only one critical point , @xmath81 , hence @xmath82 since the critical point is a saddle , the solution is unique and exists for all values of @xmath83 .",
    "having obtained the unique solution to ( [ sos ] ) , we then define @xmath84 it is easily seen from ( [ defu ] ) that @xmath85 hence the maxwell equation implies @xmath86 and we can write @xmath87 inverting ( [ vu ] ) gives @xmath88 .",

    "the chiral field has little effect on the background metric and we may take @xmath96 and express @xmath97 in terms of the mass @xmath98 , electric charge @xmath13 and magnetic charge @xmath20 of the black hole as @xmath99 the skyrme field equation ( [ sfieldeq ] ) on this background is therefore @xmath100 this should be solved subject to the boundary condition on @xmath101 which fixes the total charge , @xmath102 the non - extremal black hole posseses two horizons at @xmath103 and @xmath39 @xmath104 , related to the mass and charge by @xmath105 the solution to equation ( [ simplef ] ) can be obtained analytically , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a legendre function and @xmath108 the black hole becomes a dyon with electric charge related to the value of @xmath38 at the event horizon , @xmath109 this relation can be solved , together with ( [ masscharge ] ) , to obtain @xmath110 , showing the existence of a one parameter family of solutions ( @xmath111 and @xmath20 being regarded as fixed ) . in particular , @xmath112 as @xmath98 approaches the extremal limit @xmath113 and the meson field is expelled from the hole .",
    "larger values of @xmath83 may be realised for a hypothetical model where @xmath9 is unrelated to pions and this is discussed below .",
    "we will consider a static solution .",
    "we can replace @xmath90 by a mass function @xmath114 , defined implicitly by the relation @xmath115 where the charge is given by equation ( [ charge ] ) .",
    "the equations become @xmath116 suitable boundary conditions are @xmath117 and @xmath118 as @xmath119 .    in the numerical results the fields",
    "are scaled to the horizon size , @xmath120 the solutions are parameterised by a parameter @xmath121 , defined by @xmath122 which is restricted to @xmath123 .",
    "the extremal black hole solutions have @xmath124 .",
    "the regular solution to equation ( [ hatf ] ) has , @xmath125 hence the proton lies fully outside the black hole , as we saw before .",
    "the numerical solution for @xmath38 is shown in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "this agrees well with the result ( [ oneex ] ) of the previuos section , because the value of @xmath83 used here is still quite small .",
    "the results are still qualitatively similar for chiral models with @xmath83 of order one .",
    "[ fig1 ]    for the non - extremal solution , we begin the integration of the field equations close to the horizon , with @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are shooting parameters determined so as to satisfy the boundary conditions at infinity .    as can be seen from the above expansion , the skyrme field must have a nonzero value at the horizon otherwise the only allowed solution is the trivial one .",
    "consequently the nonextremal black hole acquires an electric charge @xmath129 and allows the skyrmion to have fractional electric charge .",
    "the numerical results for this solution are shown in fig.([fig2])-([fig3 ] ) .",
    "again , these agree well with the fixed background for small values of @xmath83 .",
    "[ fig2 ]    [ fig3 ]    we have a single one parameter family of solutions with @xmath123 . in fig.([fig4])-([fig5 ] ) , we plot the horizon radius @xmath130 and skyrmion mass @xmath131 as functions of black hole mass @xmath98 .",
    "figure ( [ fig4 ] ) is related to the entropy of the black hole ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the other figure shows how the proportion of the skyrmion which is swallowed by the black hole increases with the black hole mass .",
    "[ fig4 ]    [ fig5 ]    the last figure ( [ fig6 ] ) shows how the horizon value of @xmath38 changes as the coupling constant @xmath83 changes .",
    "since @xmath83 characterises the mass scale of the chiral model , this is amounts to a comparison of different models .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , for small @xmath83 the electromagnetic interaction is dominant so that the skyrmion is absorbed by the black hole to a lesser extent . on the other hand for large @xmath83",
    "the gravitational interaction is dominant so that most of the skyrmion is absorbed by the black hole .",
    "in this section we show that the skyrmion solutions which we have obtained are stable under spherically symmetric linear perturbations .",
    "we shall begin with the analysis of a skyrmion on the fixed background .    in the fixed background case",
    "the skyrme field is the only perturbed field and can be expanded about the skyrmion solution @xmath133 by writing @xmath134 equation ( [ pertf ] ) is inserted into equation ( [ simplef ] ) to obtain the eigenvalue equation @xmath135 where the background equation has been used .",
    "if @xmath136 is real and @xmath137 the solution is stable , and if @xmath136 is imaginary and @xmath138 it is unstable since the mode can grow or decay exponentially under the small perturbation . to show which is the case we multiply both sides of equation ( [ fixeigen ] ) by @xmath139 and integrate in @xmath58 from the horizon to infinity @xmath140\\;dr =            \\omega^{2}\\int_{r_{+}}^{\\infty } \\ ;       \\frac{r^{4}}{\\delta_{0}}\\xi^{2 } \\ ; dr \\ ; ,      { } \\ ] ] where integration by parts and boundary conditions have been used .",
    "it can be seen that the integrands of both sides are positive definite , which means that @xmath141 .",
    "hence the skyrmion on the fixed background is linearly stable .",
    "next we analyse the stability of the skyrmion with backreaction . in this case",
    "we have to expand the metric as well as the skyrme field around the classical solutions @xmath133 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 @xmath144 these are substituted into eq.([sfieldeq])-([mfieldeq ] ) to obtain the following coupled equations up to first order @xmath145^{\\prime } -\\frac{\\lambda^{2 } }           { r^{2}}\\left(\\delta_{1}f_{0 }      + f_{1}\\right)e^{\\delta_{0}}&= &      \\frac{r^{4}}{\\delta_{0}}e^{-\\delta_{0}}\\ddot{f}_{1 }      \\label{pf } \\\\",

    "the skyrmion solution on the fixed black hole background was obtained analytically in both extremal and nonextremal cases . in the extremal case ,",
    "the baryon number and electric charge are expelled by the horizon and the system represents protons bound to monopole black holes .",
    "we found a general solution on the eintein equations in the extremal case with many similarities to the bps monopole system .    in the nonextremal case",
    ", the monopole black hole partially swallows the proton and transforms to a dyon black hole , leaving fractional electric charge and baryon number outside the horizon .",

    "the effect of the backreaction is important only for very massive skyrmions i.e. very large coupling constant .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to the solutions without backreaction .",
    "since the solutions are stable , baryon decay can only take place when extra particle fields are included in the model .",
    "if we introduce a charged field @xmath164 on the fixed background , then following the proceedure described in reference @xcite , the equations become ( approximately ) @xmath165 the stability arguments no longer apply .",
