    "the wavelength shifting ( wls ) fibers are approximately @xmath26  m long , and are read out on one end while the other end is mirrored by vacuum deposition of al to obtain @xmath27 reflectivity .",
    "the fiber is potted into the hole with an optical epoxy which increases the light yield by a factor of @xmath28 .",
    "the wls fibers are bundled into groups of eight and terminated in a ddk mcp-8a fiber connector .",
    "clear fiber cables with an average length of @xmath28  m take the light from the wls fibers to hamamatsu r7600u-00 - 64 mapmts with photocathodes selected for high quantum efficiency for green light .",
    "the mapmts are enclosed in a dark box mounted onto the structure of the outer connector .",

    "digitized signals are collected by custom vme readout controllers through lvds chains of twelve front - end boards and transferred to the data acquisition computer over a pci - vme bridge .",
    "slow control messages are also exchanged with the front - end boards over the lvds readout chains .",
    "this entire chain of light collection , electronics and readout has been tested in a `` vertical slice test '' ( vst ) array consisting of three layers of of scintillator strips in small planes .",
    "based on the results from this test , the light yield is projected to be @xmath29@xmath30  photoelectrons / mev of deposited energy in the strip , depending on where in the along the strip the particle passes .",

    "the side ecal is constructed simply by placing lead absorber around the outside of each scintillator plane , and ecal and hcal modules have scintillator planes interspersed with thin lead or thick steel absorbers covering the full face of the scintillator .",
