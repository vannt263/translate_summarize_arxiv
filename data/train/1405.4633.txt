    "the determination of the nucleon s spin into its quark and gluon components is still an important challenge in particle physics .",
    "the deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments performed at desy , slac , cern , and jlab have refined our understanding of the spin distributions and revealed the spin - dependent structure functions of the nucleon .",
    "the polarized structure functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 are measured in deep - inelastic scattering of a longitudinally polarized lepton on polarized nuclear targets .",
    "theoretical models have remarkably improved since the early framework of quark parton model ( qpm ) indicated that @xmath0 measures only quark contributions to the nucleon s spin and @xmath1 is identically zero .",
    "afterward , perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) analysis in next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) approximation provides information on the role of gluons in the overall spin of the nucleon",
    ". moreover , @xmath1 contains nonperturative higher twist",
    "( ht ) contributions , such as quark - quark and quark - gluon correlations and quark mass effects , which are not interpreted in qpm .",
    "operator product expansion ( ope ) based on qcd is an appropriate formalism that is applicable to interpret @xmath1 structure function @xcite .",
    "the traditional method to perform global fits concentrates on the extraction of leading twist parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , using cuts on minimum values of @xmath6 and hadronic final - state mass squared @xmath7 .",
    "the cuts are of the order @xmath8 gev@xmath9 and @xmath10 gev@xmath9 @xcite , which means that @xmath11 is limited to @xmath12 .",
    "these kinematic cuts eliminate the contribution of corrections from various nonperturbative effects at finite @xmath6 , such as target mass corrections ( tmcs ) @xcite and dynamical higher twist contributions @xcite .",
    "these corrections become increasingly significant as @xmath6 is reduced and @xmath11 tends to @xmath13 . the large-@xmath11 behavior of pdfs",
    "is extrapolated in this classical scenario .",
    "extraction of polarized pdfs ( ppdfs ) from a variety of experiments within nlo analyses is an important phenomenological issue @xcite . to compensate for the scarcity of polarized high - energy data points available to global ppdf analyses , the applied cuts were relaxed ; thereby , one is typically forced to make use of the data at lower @xmath6 and higher @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , pqcd calculation can not be trusted alone . as will be shown subsequently , in this kinematical region ( @xmath14 )",
    ", tmcs and ht contributions are important .",
    "some of the existing studies , such as refs .",
    "@xcite , use these effects in their global fitting procedure .",
    "note that the @xmath1 polarized structure function is not considered in these analyses .",
    "but it helps to determine the low-@xmath6 corrections due to following reasons .",
    "first , leading and higher twist contributions appear with the same order of importance .",
    "second , @xmath1 data are mostly in the low-@xmath6 region in which the effects of tmcs and ht become significant . because of the mentioned points , we believe that , although data for spin structure function @xmath1 is not accurate enough , at the current level of accuracy , analyzing both @xmath0 and @xmath1 structure functions provides a fertile ground to study the mentioned effects . a future high - luminosity machine , like the eic , is required to study the twist-3 contributions in detail @xcite .    in our latest analysis @xcite , we determined ppdfs based on jacobi polynomials using only @xmath0 experimental data and simply considered @xmath15 . in the present study",
    ", we improve our precision with full @xmath0 and @xmath1 analysis including tmcs and ht contributions .",
    "no polynomial technique is adopted .",

    "section [ conclusions ] contains the concluding remarks .",
    "in the qcd polarized structure function , @xmath0 consists of two parts , the leading twist ( lt ) ( @xmath18 ) and the higher twist ( @xmath19 ) contributions : @xmath20 the lt term can be determined from @xmath21 @xmath22 is achievable via nlo perturbative qcd when the nucleon mass is put equal to zero and @xmath23 is calculable in pqcd .",
    "it is kinematic in origin and contains terms suppressed by powers of @xmath24 at large values of @xmath6 .",
    "the contribution of multiparton correlation in the nucleon is considered through the dynamical higher twist terms @xmath25 where @xmath26 are nonpurtubative effects that can be calculated in a model - dependent manner .",
    "they are dynamical in origin and suppressed by powers of @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the scale of nonperturbative parton - parton correlation .",
    "these corrections become increasingly important at low - energy scale .",
    "the spin - structure function @xmath1 does not have a direct interpretation in pqcd .",
    "it can be understood using the ope in which @xmath1 is separated into @xcite @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is a twist-2 part , and @xmath31\\frac{dy}{y}.\\ ] ] the twist-3 part , @xmath32 , arises from nonperturbative multiparton interaction , which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "@xmath33 depends on the quark transverse polarization density in twist-2 , which is suppressed by the ratio of the quark to nucleon masses @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , any deviation of @xmath35 from @xmath36 is from the twist-3 contribution .",
    "it is in special properties of @xmath1 that its ht contribution can be equally important as its twist-2 part , since it is not suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath6 .",

    "the deuteron structure function can be obtained via the relation @xmath43 from proton and neutron ones , where @xmath44 is the probability to find the deuteron in a @xmath45state .",
    "because of the fact that @xmath0 and @xmath1 contain the same twist-2 operators , the leading twist part of @xmath1 can be extracted via the wandzura  wilczek ( ww ) relation @xcite @xmath46 this relation remains valid when target mass corrections are included in the twist-2 contribution @xcite .      to perform a reliable fit that contains data at lower values of @xmath6 , nucleon mass corrections can not be neglected .",
    "we follow the method suggested by refs .",
    "@xcite , which is exactly calculable and effectively belongs to the lt term @xcite .",
    "there is a traditional challenge with the behavior of the both polarized and unpolarized target mass corrected structure functions in the neighborhood of @xmath47 .",
    "many attempts have been made to avoid this issue by considering various prescriptions in the literature @xcite .",
    "these solutions are not unique . in this paper",
    ", we follow the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite to avoid the threshold problem in the polarized structure function .",
    "they impose the simplest probability for hadronization @xmath48 . here , the largest kinematically accepted amount of @xmath11 for inelastic scattering is @xmath49 , which is defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 should be the lowest mass particle that can be produced in the process of interest .",
    "we modified our polarized structure functions by multiplying them into the @xmath52 function .",
    "higher twist terms arising from long - range nonperturbative multiparton correlations contribute at low values of @xmath6 .",
    "the blmp model @xcite made a step in developing a usable parametrization for phenomenological analysis .",
    "it constructed ht distributions from convolution integrals of the light - cone wave functions by considering a simple model based on three valence quarks and one gluon with the total zero angular momentum .",
    "accordingly , we applied the parametrization form suggested by the blmp model , @xmath53\\nonumber\\\\ & + & ( 1-x)^3[b - c(1-x)+d(1-x)^2\\nonumber\\\\ & -&e(1-x)^3]\\ , \\label{eq : g2ht}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in our initial scale and fit the coefficients to the data .",
    "we applied a nonsinglet evolution equation , since higher twist contributions are specially important in large-@xmath11 values .",
    "this approach is compared with exact evolution equations for the gluon - quark - antiquark correlation in ref .",
    "they are practically equal .    by the integral relation of @xmath54\\ , \\label{eq : g1ht}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the twist-3 part of different spin - dependent structure functions , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , are related @xcite .",

    "considering su(3 ) flavor symmetry , we have @xmath65 .",
    "the free unknown parameters provide a fit with a large degree of flexibility .",
