    "it has been demonstrated recently that a quantum computer , exploiting quantum state superposition and entanglement , is definitely more powerful than any existing classical computer  @xcite .",
    "many `` quantum '' algorithms that achieve the same computational tasks much faster than their classical counterparts have been designed  @xcite . thus far",
    ", nmr has been the most successful method employed to physically implement small quantum information processors and to test the power of intrinsically quantum algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the visualisation of a spin-1/2 particle as a qubit , combined with existing multi - dimensional nmr methods has led to breakthroughs in pseudopure state preparation  @xcite , the demonstration of universal quantum logic gates  @xcite , and the implementation of various quantum algorithms  @xcite .",
    "early on , deutsch and jozsa presented a simple problem to determine whether a boolean function @xmath0 is constant or balanced  @xcite .",
    "classically , the algorithm requires many function calls to solve the problem without error , but a quantum computer can solve the problem using only a single function call .",
    "the cleve version of the algorithm used an extra qubit to encode the required unitary transformations and the solution could be read out as the relative phase of the qubits  @xcite .",
    "recently , the deutsch - jozsa ( dj ) problem was modified and implemented using a lesser number of input qubits  @xcite , and interest continues in further generalisations of the dj problem  @xcite .",
    "it was realised that , for upto two bits the dj problem need not invoke entangling transformations for its solution .",
    "the problem thus allows a classical description for the two - qubit case , and it is only for three or more qubits that the quantum nature of the algorithm is displayed  @xcite . as pointed out recently by seth lloyd  @xcite , grover s search algorithm for two qubits also does not require entangling transformations .",
    "hence both these algorithms become truly quantum only for three or more qubits .    a quantum algorithm to distinguish between even and odd functions using fewer function calls than a classical algorithm has been recently designed  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm uses entangling transformations at the two - qubit level itself and is an interesting example of the power of a quantum computer over corresponding classical systems . in this paper",
    ", we present the experimental implementation of the algorithm on a two - qubit nmr quantum computer .",
    "the requisite unitary transformations have been implemented using spin - selective and composite - z pulses .",
    "a judicious combination of composite pulses and evolution under the scalar coupling hamiltonian has been used to construct the desired entangling transformations .",
    "the algorithm requires distinguishing between non - orthogonal states of the two qubits in order to classify the functions  @xcite . in our nmr implementation",
    ", such a distinction is achieved in a single measurement . the algorithm to evaluate the even or odd nature of a function uses entangling transformations for its implementation on two input qubits .",
    "entangling transformations can produce entangled states that have no classical analogue  @xcite .",
    "consider a boolean function defined from a two - bit domain space to a one - bit range space : @xmath1 .",
    "there are four possible input values @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the output for each of these being either @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "the 16 possible functions can be divided into sub - classes based on the number of ones and zeros in their outputs .",
    "the functions can be categorised in the sub - classes @xmath6 , \\ , [ 1,3 ] , \\,[2,2 ] , \\,[3,1 ] , $ ] or @xmath7\\/$ ] , where the first entry indicates the number of ones and the second indicates the number of zeros in the output .",
    "the functions with an even number of ones in the output ( the functions belonging to the categories @xmath6 , \\ , [ 2,2]\\/$ ] and @xmath8\\/$ ] ) are denoted `` * even * '' functions while the functions with an odd number of ones in the output ( the @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath10 $ ] functions ) are said to be `` * odd * '' functions .",
    "for the two - qubit case , we thus have 8 even and 8 odd functions .",
    "classically , the classification of a function as even or odd would require computing it at all input points .",
    "the quantum algorithm constructed uses just two function calls to evaluate the even or odd character of the given function  @xcite .",
    "the implementation requires a quantum gate to call the function , and a judicious use of pseudo - hadamard transformations ( on both qubits , and selectively on one qubit alone ) .",
    "the function call mechanism is similar to the one used to solve the modified deutsch problem  @xcite .",
    "each function @xmath0 can be encoded by a unitary transformation @xmath11 , with its action on the eigenstates of the two qubits being defined as @xmath12 pseudo - hadamard gates  @xcite are practically equivalent to the hadamard operator and have been utilised throughout our analysis .",
    "the one - qubit pseudo - hadamard gate is given by @xmath13    in our analysis , the pseudo - hadamard gate is applied on both qubits non - selectively as well as selectively on one qubit alone .",
    "the corresponding gates are denoted as @xmath14 where @xmath5 and @xmath15 label the qubit involved .",
    "there are sixteen @xmath11 matrices in all , with eight of them being entangling and the rest non - entangling in character .",
    "for example , the @xmath11 matrix with diagonal entries @xmath16\\/$ ] can not be written as a tensor product of two matrices , one belonging to each qubit .",
    "this unitary transformation is hence entangling in nature .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the two - bit case , the sub - class of functions that are either constant or balanced in the sense of the deutsch problem i.e. the functions belonging to the @xmath17 and @xmath18 sub - classes , are all separable in character .",
    "therefore , the two - bit deutsch problem affords a classical explanation and can be implemented using non - entangling transformations alone .",
    "a quantum circuit to evaluate the even or odd nature of a function is shown in figure  [ circuit ] .",
    "the algorithm starts with both qubits in a thermal ( mixed ) initial state .",
    "a pseudo - hadamard transformation is applied on both qubits , resulting in both of them being in a state which is a superposition of all possible input states .",
    "the desired unitary transformation @xmath11 is then applied on this superposition state , followed by a pseudo - hadamard gate operating on the second qubit alone .",
    "the function is called again through @xmath11 and an inverse pseudo - hadamard is applied on both qubits before the read - out operation .",
    "the result of the computation is encoded in the final state of the two qubits .",
    "if the function is even , both the qubits are in an unentangled state and a signal is obtained for the qubit on which the selective pseudo - hadamard gate is applied , with no signal being obtained for the other qubit .",
    "if the function is odd , both qubits are in an entangled state , corresponding to multiple - quantum coherence of the two spins , and no observable signal is obtained .",
    "the even or odd nature of the function can thus be distinguished `` pictorially '' , by looking at the final nmr spectrum .",
    "previously , the algorithm has been described for a pure initial state  @xcite . in nmr",
    "one normally encounters mixed states .",
    "hence we first generalise the procedure to include mixed initial states .",
    "consider the two qubits in an initial state described by the deviation density matrix @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 being independent variables .",
    "for @xmath22 and @xmath23 this density matrix represents a pseudopure state . for @xmath22 and @xmath24 it represents a thermal state .",
    "multiples of identity have been ignored in the density matrix , as they do not contribute to the measured signal in an nmr experiment .",
    "we now evolve this density matrix through the sequence of operations @xmath25^{-1}\\/$ ] . after some algebra ,",
    "this leads to the deviation density matrix @xmath26 where @xmath27 or @xmath28 , for different @xmath11 transformations . for @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "we arrive at the the pure state result of  @xcite i.e. , the final state is @xmath29 for an * even * function and @xmath30 for an * odd * function . for a thermal initial state",
    "i.e. @xmath31 , the deviation density matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 , can be distinguished unambiguously by a single nmr measurement .",
    "the spectrum for even functions will give two lines corresponding to the observable single quantum coherences present in the density matrix .",
    "for odd functions there is no signal as the only non - diagonal elements of the density matrix are the ones corresponding to double - quantum coherences .",
    "we note here that a single nmr measurement is able to distinguish between two non - orthogonal quantum states which is normally not possible using other measurement techniques  @xcite .",
    "we further note that the presence of double - quantum coherences in the final state for the odd functions shows the entangling nature of the unitary transformations used .",
    "the use of a hadamard instead of a pseudo - hadamard transformation would lead to results which are qualitatively similar .",
    "the entanglement in the final state would show up as a zero - quantum coherence of the two qubits , instead of a double - quantum coherence  @xcite .",
    "we have implemented the two - qubit even / odd quantum algorithm using the molecule of 5-fluorouracil ( dissolved in dmso ) as an nmr quantum computer , with the fluorine and the ortho - proton being identified as the two input qubits .",
    "this fluorine - proton spin system is a good candidate for quantum computing since it has good sensitivity , a resolved j - coupling of 6.1 hz and the duration of spin - selective pulses can be relatively short .",
    "all experiments have been performed on a bruker amx-400 spectrometer at room temperature .",
    "the pseudo - hadamard gate has been achieved by applying a @xmath34 pulse selectively on a spin , or non - selectively on both spins , as the case maybe .",

    "global phase changes are not detectable in nmr and are hence ignored for the purposes of the experiment .",

    "all these even transformations can be decomposed into transformations in the subspaces of each individual qubit and have hence been implemented experimentally without invoking quantum entanglement .",

    "spin - selective pulses of @xmath49 secs on the proton and @xmath50 secs on the fluorine have been used to achieve good selectivity .",
