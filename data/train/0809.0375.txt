    "the discovery of the accelerated hubble expansion in the snia data @xcite , combined with observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , has forced a profound shift in our cosmological paradigm .",
    "if one makes the conservative assumptions of the validity of einstein s general relativity and the cosmological principle , one concludes that the universe is presently dominated by a component that violates the strong energy condition , dubbed _ dark energy _ ( de ) .",
    "moreover , primordial nucleosynthesis constrains the fraction of closure density in baryons , @xmath0 , to a few percent , while galactic rotation curves and cluster dynamics imply the existence of a nonbaryonic _ dark matter _ ( dm ) component with @xmath1 ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "currently , the best fit values are @xmath2 and @xmath3 = 0.74 @xcite .",
    "thus it may be said that we have a firm theoretical understanding of only 4% of our universe .",
    "pragmatically , the data can be accommodated by combining baryons with conventional cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidates and a simple cosmological constant @xmath4 providing the de .",
    "this @xmath4cdm model , however , begs the question of why @xmath4 is non - zero , but such that dm and de are comparable today .",
    "the coincidence problem of the @xmath4cdm model is somewhat ameliorated in _ quintessence _ models which replace @xmath4 by an evolving scalar field .",
    "however , like its predecessor , a quintessence - cdm model assumes that dm and de are distinct entities . for a recent review of the most popular dm and de models , see @xcite .",
    "another interpretation of this data is that dm / de are different manifestations of a common structure .",
    "speculations of this sort were initially made by hu @xcite .",
    "the first definite model of this type was proposed a few years ago @xcite , based upon the chaplygin gas , a perfect fluid obeying the equation of state @xmath5 which has been extensively studied for its mathematical properties @xcite . the general class of models , in which a unification of dm and de is achieved through a single entity , is often referred to as _ quartessence _",
    "@xcite . among other scenarios of unification that have recently been suggested ,",
    "interesting attempts are based on the so - called _ k - essence _",
    "@xcite , a scalar field with noncanonical kinetic terms which was first introduced as a model for inflation @xcite .    the cosmological potential of equation ( [ eq001 ] )",
    "was first noted by kamenshchik _",
    "et al _ @xcite , who observed that integrating the energy conservation equation in a homogeneous model leads to @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the scale factor normalized to unity today and @xmath8 an integration constant .",
    "thus , the chaplygin gas interpolates between matter , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , at high redshift and a cosmological constant like @xmath11 as @xmath7 tends to infinity . the essence of the idea in @xcite is simply that in an _ inhomogeneous _ universe , highly overdense regions ( galaxies , clusters ) have @xmath12 providing dm , whereas in underdense regions ( voids ) evolution drives @xmath13 to its limiting value @xmath14 giving de",
    "of particular interest is that the chaplygin gas has an equivalent scalar field formulation @xcite .",
    "considering the lagrangian @xmath15 where @xmath16 equation ( [ eq001 ] ) is obtained by evaluating the stress - energy tensor @xmath17 , and introducing @xmath18 for the four - velocity and @xmath19 for the energy density .",
    "one recognizes @xmath20 as a lagrangian of the born - infeld type , familiar in the @xmath21-brane constructions of string/@xmath22 theory @xcite .",
    "geometrically , @xmath20 describes space - time as the world - volume of a 3 + 1 brane in a 4 + 1 bulk via the embedding coordinate @xmath23 @xcite . to be able to claim that a field theoretical model actually achieves unification",
    ", one must be assured that initial perturbations can evolve into a deeply nonlinear regime to form a gravitational condensate of superparticles that can play the role of cdm . in @xcite",
    "this was inferred on the basis of the zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "in fact , for this issue , the usual zeldovich approximation has the shortcoming that the effects of finite sound speed are neglected .",
    "all models that unify dm and de face the problem of nonvanishing sound speed and the well - known jeans instability . a fluid with a nonzero sound speed",
    "has a characteristic scale below which the pressure effectively opposes gravity .",
    "hence the perturbations of the scale smaller than the sonic horizon will be prevented from growing . soon after the appearance of @xcite and @xcite , it was pointed out that the perturbative chaplygin gas ( for early work see @xcite , and more recently @xcite ) is incompatible with the observed mass power spectrum @xcite and microwave background @xcite .",
    "essentially , these results follow from the adiabatic speed of sound @xmath24 which leads to a comoving acoustic horizon @xmath25 the perturbations whose comoving size @xmath26 is larger than @xmath27 grow as @xmath28 .",
    "once the perturbations enter the acoustic horizon , i.e. , as soon as @xmath29 , they undergo damped oscillations . in the case of the chaplygin gas",
    "we have @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the present day value of the hubble parameter , reaching mpc scales already at redshifts of order 10 .",
    "however , to reiterate a point made in @xcite , small perturbations _ alone _ are not the issue , since large density contrasts are required on galactic and cluster scales .",
    "as soon as @xmath32 the linear perturbation theory can not be trusted .",
    "an essentially nonperturbative approach is needed in order to investigate whether a significant fraction of initial density perturbations collapses in gravitationally bound structure - the condensate .",
    "if that happens the system evolves into a two - phase structure - a mixture of cdm in the form of condensate and de in the form of uncondensed gas .",
    "the case , where the chaplygin gas is mixed with cdm , has been considered in a number of papers @xcite . here",
    ", the chaplygin gas simply plays the role of de . in keeping with the quartessence philosophy , it would be preferred if cdm could be replaced by droplets of chaplygin gas condensate , as in @xcite .",
    "homogeneous world models , containing a mixture of cdm and chaplygin gas , have been successfully confronted with lensing statistics @xcite as well as with supernova and other tests @xcite .",
    "another model , the so called  generalized chaplygin gas \" @xcite , has gained a wide popularity .",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas is defined as @xcite @xmath33 with @xmath34 for stability and causality . as in the chaplygin gas case",
    ", this equation of state has an equivalent field theory representation , the `` generalized born - infeld theory''@xcite .",
    "however , the associated lagrangian has no equivalent brane interpretation .",
    "the additional parameter does afford greater flexibility : e.g. for small @xmath35 the sound horizon is @xmath36 , and thus by fine tuning @xmath37 , the data can be perturbatively accommodated @xcite .",
    "bean and dor @xcite and similarly amendola _",
    "et al _ @xcite have examined a mixture of cdm and the generalized chaplygin gas against supernova , large - scale structure , and cmb constraints .",
    "they have demonstrated that a thorough likelihood analysis favors the limit @xmath38 , i.e. the equivalent to the @xmath4cdm model .",
    "both papers conclude that the standard chaplygin gas is ruled out as a candidate for de .",
    "however , analysis @xcite of the supernova data seems to indicate that the generalized chaplygin gas with @xmath39 is favored over the @xmath40 model and similar conclusions were drawn in @xcite .",
    "but one should bear in mind that the generalized chaplygin gas with @xmath41 has a superluminal sound speed that violates causality @xcite . for a different view on this issue see @xcite ( see discussion in section [ kessentials ] ) .",
    "the structure formation question , in respect of the chaplygin gas , was decided in @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the newtonian approximation , we derived an extension of the spherical model @xcite that incorporates nonlinearities in the density contrast @xmath42 , as well as the effects of the adiabatic speed of sound . both are crucial , since for an overdensity we have @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the speed of sound of the background .",
    "although small initial overdensities follow the expected perturbative evolution , for an initial @xmath45 exceeding a scale @xmath26-dependent critical @xmath46 , it was shown that @xmath47 tends to infinity at finite redshift , signaling the formation of a bound structure or _",
    "condensate_. unfortunately , it was further found that , when the required @xmath48 is folded with the spectrum of the initial density perturbations to obtain the collapse fraction , less than 1% of the chaplygin gas ends up as condensate . thus the simple chaplygin gas is not viable due to frustrated structure formation . in effect , the model is a victim of the radiation dominated phase , which turns the harrison - zeldovich spectrum @xmath49 to @xmath50 at @xmath51 mpc . in a pure chaplygin - gas universe without radiation there",
    "would inevitably be sufficient small scale power to drive condensation .",
    "one way to deal with the structure formation problem , is to assume entropy perturbations @xcite such that the effective speed of sound vanishes . ] . in that picture",
    "we have @xmath52 even if @xmath53 .",
    "but as we detail below , in a single field model it is precisely the adiabatic speed of sound that governs the evolution .",
    "hence , entropy perturbations require the introduction of a second field on which @xmath54 depends . aside from negating the simplicity of the one - field model ,",
    "some attempts at realizing the nonadiabatic scenario @xcite have convinced us that even if @xmath55 is arranged as an initial condition , it is all but impossible to maintain this condition in a realistic model for evolution .",
    "the failure of the simple chaplygin gas does not exhaust all the possibilities for quartessence .",
    "the born - infeld lagrangian ( [ eq003 ] ) is a special case of the string - theory inspired tachyon lagrangian @xcite in which the constant @xmath14 is replaced by a potential @xmath56 @xmath57 in turn , tachyon models are a particular case of k - essence @xcite . the possibility of obtaining both dm and de from the tachyon with inverse square potential has been speculated in @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was noted @xcite that , in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model , the tachyon model is described by the equation of state ( [ eq001 ] ) in which the constant @xmath54 is replaced by a function of the cosmological scale factor @xmath7 , so the model was dubbed `` variable chaplygin gas '' .",
    "related models have been examined in @xcite , however , those either produce a larger @xmath58 than the simple chaplygin gas @xcite , or else need fine - tuning @xcite .. the two - potential model @xcite yields @xmath59 , so it requires @xmath60 like the generalized chaplygin gas . expanding in @xmath61 , the second potential reveals itself to be dominantly a cosmological constant . ]    in this paper we develop a version of the spherical model for studying the evolution of density perturbations even into the fully nonlinear regime . although similar in spirit to @xcite , the formalism here is completely relativistic , rather than newtonian , and applicable to any k - essence model instead of being restricted to the simple chaplygin gas .",
    "the one key element we carry over from @xcite is an approximate method for treating the effects of pressure gradients - which is to say the adiabatic speed of sound - on the evolution .",
    "our method is flexible enough and can be extended to deal with a mixture of de and dm .",
    "a spherical model has been applied to de / dm mixtures in @xcite , however there the effects of pressure gradients were omitted .    we apply our method to the preliminary analysis of a unifying model based on the tachyon type lagrangian ( [ eq01 ] ) with a potential of the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a positive integer . in the regime where structure function takes place ,",
    "we show that this model effectively behaves as the variable chaplygin gas with @xmath64 with @xmath65 for a quadratic ( quartic ) potential . as a result",
    ", the much smaller acoustic horizon @xmath66 enhances condensate formation by two orders of magnitude over the simple chaplygin gas ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "hence this type of model may salvage the quartessence scenario .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ kessentials ]",
    "we reformulate k - essence type models in a way that allows us to deal with large density inhomogeneities . in section 3",
    "we develop the spherical model approximation that closes the system of equations .",
    "these two sections are completely general and stand alone .",
    "numerical results , in section 4 , are presented for positive power - law potentials and contrasted with the simple chaplygin gas .",
    "our conclusions and outlook are given in section [ conclude ] . finally , in [ adiabatic",
    "] , we derive the adiabatic speed of sound for a general k - essence fluid , and in [ dbrane ] , we give a brief description of the tachyon model from the braneworld perspective .",
    "a minimally coupled k - essence model @xcite , is described by @xmath68 , \\label{eq4001}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the most general lagrangian , which depends on a single scalar field @xmath70 of dimension @xmath71 , and on the dimensionless quantity @xmath72 defined in ( [ eq1203 ] ) . for @xmath73 that holds in a cosmological setting , the energy momentum tensor obtained from ( [ eq4001 ] )",

    "the associated hydrodynamic quantities are @xmath84 @xmath85    two general conditions can be placed upon the functional dependence of @xmath69 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 the first condition ( [ eq2.7 ] ) stems from the null energy condition , @xmath88 for all light like vectors @xmath89 , required for stability @xcite . for a perfect fluid we have @xmath90 , thus @xmath91 , and owing to @xmath92 , we arrive at ( [ eq2.7 ] ) .",
    "the second condition ( [ eq2.9 ] ) arises from restrictions on the speed of sound .",
    "observing that ( [ eq4004 ] ) allows us to view @xmath72 as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath70 , the adiabatic speed of sound @xmath93 as shown in appendix [ adiabatic ] , coincides with the so called _ effective _ speed of sound @xmath94 obtained in a different way in @xcite . for hydrodynamic stability",
    "we require @xmath95 .",
    "in addition , it seems physically reasonable to require @xmath96 in order to avoid possible problems with causality @xcite .",
    "causality violation in relation to superluminal sound propagation has been the subject of a recent debate @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that if k - essence is to solve the coincidence problem there must be an epoch when perturbations in the k - essence field propagate faster than light .",
    "hence , on the basis of causality it has been argued @xcite that k - essence models which solve the coincidence problem are ruled out as physically realistic candidates for de .",
    "in contrast , it has been demonstrated @xcite that superluminal sound speed propagation in generic k - essence models does not necessarily lead to causality violation and hence , the k - essence theories may still be legitimate candidates for de . as the coincidence problem is not the issue in de",
    "/ dm unification models we stick to @xmath97 . in view of @xmath98 and ( [ eq2.7 ] )",
    "equation ( [ eq2.9 ] ) follows .",
    "formally , one may proceed by solving the @xmath70 field equation @xmath99 with @xmath100 denoting @xmath101 , in conjunction with einstein s equations to obtain @xmath13 and @xmath102 .",
    "however , it proves more useful to pursue the hydrodynamic picture . for a perfect fluid the conservation equation @xmath103 yields , as its longitudinal part @xmath104 , the continuity equation @xmath105 and , as its transverse part , the euler equation @xmath106 where we define @xmath107 the tensor @xmath108 is a projector onto the three - space orthogonal to @xmath109 .",
    "the quantity @xmath110 is the local hubble parameter .",
    "overdots indicate the proper time derivative .",
    "now , using ( [ eq511])-([eq4004 ] ) the @xmath70 field equation ( [ eq07 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath111 or @xmath112 where , as before , @xmath113 .",
    "hence , for @xmath114 ( purely kinetic k - essence ) , the @xmath70 field equation ( [ eq07 ] ) is equivalent to ( [ eq04 ] ) . in the general case ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath115 , equation ( [ eq07 ] ) together with ( [ eq04 ] ) implies @xmath116 provided ( [ eq4004 ] ) is invertible .",
    "next , we observe that euler s equation can be written in various forms .",
    "equation @xmath117 follows directly from ( [ eq511])-([eq4004 ] ) and ( [ eq101 ] ) . with @xmath72 a function of @xmath70 and @xmath13 ,",
    "the pressure @xmath102 also becomes a function of @xmath70 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus by ( [ eq511 ] ) , ( [ eq4006 ] ) and ( [ eq06 ] ) we find @xmath118 this is a simple demonstration of the observation made earlier , that in a single component system it is the adiabatic ( rather than effective ) speed of sound that controls evolution . rather than specifying @xmath69 directly , one may choose @xmath119 and then find @xmath120 from ( [ eq4003 ] ) .",
    "up to an overall multiplicative integration function of @xmath70 only ( which in turn can be absorbed in a reparameterization of @xmath70 itself ) equations ( [ eq027 ] ) and ( [ eq028 ] ) imply @xmath121 which may be used in ( [ eq026 ] ) as an evolution equation for @xmath70 , while ( [ eq04 ] ) is an evolution equation for @xmath13 .",
    "further , equation ( [ eq029 ] ) can be formally inverted to give @xmath13 as a function of @xmath70 and @xmath72 , thus allowing the construction of @xmath122 .",
    "an example of this will be given in section 4 .",
    "however , first we need to close the system of evolution equations .",
    "since the 4-velocity ( [ eq511 ] ) is derived from a potential , the associated rotation tensor vanishes identically .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation for the velocity congruence assumes a simple form @xmath123 with the shear tensor defined as @xmath124 we thus obtain an evolution equation for @xmath125 that appears in ( [ eq04 ] ) , sourced by gravity through the ricci tensor @xmath126 and by both shear and the divergence of the acceleration @xmath127 . if @xmath128 , as for dust , equations ( [ eq04 ] ) and ( [ eq030 ] ) , together with einstein s equations for @xmath129 comprise the spherical model @xcite .",
    "however , we are not interested in dust , since generally @xmath130 as given by euler s equation ( [ eq028 ] ) .",
    "indeed , this term is responsible for the jeans phenomenon in perturbation theory .",
    "one is only allowed to neglect @xmath127 in the long wavelength limit , where everything clusters , but one has no realistic information about the small ( i.e. subhorizon ) scales .    the spherical top - hat profile is often invoked to justify neglecting the acceleration term ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , this leads to infinite pressure forces on the bubble boundary .",
    "even if suitably regularized , the influence of these large forces on the bubble evolution is never accounted for .",
    "needless to say , this makes the reliability of the inferences highly problematic , unless one invokes entropy perturbations again .    for a one - component model , the raychaudhury equation ( [ eq030 ] ) combines with einstein s equations to @xmath131 with @xmath132    in general , the 4-velocity @xmath133 can be decomposed as @xcite @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the 4-velocity of fiducial observers at rest in the coordinate system , and @xmath136 is spacelike , with @xmath137 and @xmath138 . in a multi - component model ( e.g. dark energy plus cdm , or a mixture of condensed and uncondensed k - essence ) one can , in the first approximation , neglect the relative peculiar velocities",

    "according to ( [ eq160 ] ) , the local hubble parameter at the origin is related to the local expansion scale as @xmath176 evaluating ( [ eq008 ] ) at the origin yields our working approximation to the raychaudhuri equation , i.e. we obtain @xmath177 the recommendations of this equation are that it extends the spherical dust model , by incorporating both pressure and , via the speed of sound , the jeans phenomenon .",

    "the evolution starts from a small initial value of @xmath232 and large @xmath233 so that initially @xmath234 and we take initial @xmath235 to be positive . according to ( [ eq050 ] ) , as @xmath70 increases and @xmath13 decreases , @xmath72 decreases up to a point where it becomes 0 .",
    "the first such point may be roughly at @xmath7 between 0.1 and 1 . at that point",
    "the sign of @xmath235 flips and @xmath72 remains positive up to the next point at which @xmath236 .",
    "the sign of @xmath235 flips again keeping @xmath72 positive , and so on .",
    "basically , this process continues _",
    "ad infinitum _ never violating @xmath198 .",
    "hence , the perfect fluid assumption is legitimate even in the deep non - linear regime .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "the representative case of evolution of two initial perturbations starting from decoupling for @xmath26 = 10 kpc is shown for @xmath237 .",
    "the plots represent two distinct regimes : the growing mode or condensation ( blue dashed line ) and the damped oscillations ( red solid line ) .",
    "in contrast to the linear theory , where for any @xmath26 the acoustic horizon will eventually stop @xmath238 from growing , irrespective of the initial value of the perturbation , here we have for an initial @xmath239 above a certain threshold @xmath240 , @xmath241 at finite @xmath7 , just as in the dust model . thus perturbations with @xmath242",
    "evolve into a _ nonlinear _ gravitational condensate that at low @xmath243 behaves as pressureless super - particles .",
    "conversely , for a sufficiently small @xmath239 , the acoustic horizon can stop @xmath244 from growing ; at low redshift the perturbations behave as expected from _ linear _ theory .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows how the threshold @xmath245 divides the two regimes depending on the comoving scale @xmath26 .",
    "the crucial question now is what fraction of the tachyon gas goes into condensate . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that if this fraction was sufficiently large , the cmb and the mass power spectrum could be reproduced for the simple chaplygin gas . to answer this question quantitatively",
    ", we follow the press - schechter procedure @xcite as in @xcite . assuming @xmath246 is given by a gaussian random field with dispersion @xmath247 , and including the notorious factor of 2 , to account for the cloud in cloud problem , the condensate fraction at a scale @xmath26 is given by @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the threshold shown in figure [ fig2 ] . in figure [ fig2 ] we also exhibit the dispersion @xmath250 calculated using the gaussian window function and the variance of the concordance model @xcite @xmath251 in figure 3 we present @xmath252 , calculated using ( [ eq401])-([eq403 ] ) with const=7.11@xmath253 , the spectral index @xmath254=1.02 , and the parameterization of bardeen _ et",
    "@xcite for the transfer function @xmath255 with @xmath0=0.04 .",
    "the parameters are fixed by fitting ( [ eq403 ] ) to the 2dfgrs power spectrum data @xcite .",
    "our result demonstrates that the collapse fraction is about 70% for @xmath256 for a wide range of the comoving size @xmath26 and peaks at about 45% for @xmath214 .",
    "albeit encouraging , these preliminary results do not in themselves demonstrate that the tachyon with potential ( 8) constitutes a viable cosmology .",
    "such a step requires the inclusion of baryons and comparison with the full cosmological data , much of which obtains at low redshift .",
    "what has been shown is that it is not valid in an adiabatic model to simply pursue linear perturbations to the original background : the system evolves nonlinearly into a mixed system of gravitational condensate and residual k - essence so that the `` background '' at low @xmath243 is quite different from the initial one . because of this one needs new computational tools for a meaningful confrontation with the data .",
    "the first key test for any proposed quartessence model should be : does it actually yield nonlinear dark matter structure , as well as linear dark energy in the _ inhomogeneous _ _ almost _ frw universe that we see . in this paper",
    "we have analyzed the nonlinear evolution of the tachyon - like k - essence with a very simple potential @xmath257 .",
    "we have demonstrated that a significant fraction of the fluid , in particular for @xmath256 , collapses into condensate objects that play the role of cold dark matter .",
    "no dimensionless fine tunings were required beyond the inevitable @xmath258 .",
    "moreover , these results were obtained in a relativistic framework for nonlinear evolution that is as simple as the spherical dust model but includes the key effects of the acoustic horizon . although it could be subject to possible improvements ( e.g. a variable gaussian width @xcite , and it is lacking the sophistication of the exact spherical model , @xcite",
    ", it does allow us to make the sort of quantitative assessments that have been missing @xcite .",
    "it is directly formulated in a convenient coordinate gauge , does not involve any hidden assumptions , and it easily deals with multi - component systems .",
    "the tachyon k - essence unification remains to be tested against large - scale structure and cmb observations .",
    "however , we maintain , contrary to the opinion advocated in @xcite , that the sound speed problem may be alleviated in unified models no more unnatural than the @xmath4cdm model .",
    "indeed , an encouraging feature of the positive power - law potential is that it provides for acceleration as a periodic transient phenomenon @xcite which obviates the de sitter horizon problem @xcite , and , we speculate , could even be linked to inflation .",
    "the standard definition of the adiabatic speed of sound is @xmath259 where the differentiation is taken at constant @xmath260 , i.e. for an isentropic process . here",
    "@xmath261 is the entropy density and @xmath262 the particle number density associated with the particle number @xmath151 .",
    "we use the terminology and notation of landau and lifshitz @xcite ( see also @xcite ) ) . for a general k - essence , with @xmath263 , equation ( [ eq2601 ] )",
    "may be written as @xmath264 where the differentials @xmath265 and @xmath266 are subject to the constraint @xmath267 .",
    "next we show that this constraint implies @xmath268 .",
    "we start from the standard thermodynamical relation @xmath269 where the volume is , up to a constant factor , given by @xmath270 .",
    "equation ( [ eq1601 ] ) may then be written in the form @xmath271 where @xmath272 is the enthalpy per particle .",
    "for an isentropic relativistic flow one can define a flow potential @xmath70 such that @xcite @xmath273 comparing this with ( [ eq511 ] ) we find @xmath274 this together with ( [ eq4003 ] ) and ( [ eq4004 ] ) yields in turn @xmath275 this expression for the particle number density is derived for an isentropic process . in a purely kinetic k - essence with @xmath276 , equation ( [ eq2603 ] ) follows from the field equation for @xmath70 @xmath277 which implies conservation of the current @xmath278 the particle number density @xmath63 in this expression coincides with ( [ eq2603 ] ) .",
    "however , in a general k - essence , with @xmath263 , the field equation ( [ eq07 ] ) does not imply that the current ( [ eq2602 ] ) is conserved .",
    "nevertheless , equation ( [ eq2603 ] ) is still a valid expression for a conserved particle number density when the condition @xmath267 is imposed .    from ( [ eq1603 ] ) with @xmath267 and using ( [ eq1602 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath279 comparing this with the general expression for the total differential of @xmath102 @xmath280 we must have @xmath268 and @xmath281 as it should be .",
    "hence , we conclude that an isentropic process implies @xmath268 and equation ( [ eq3601 ] ) yields @xmath282",
    "it is useful to view the tachyon condensate from the braneworld perspective .",
    "consider a 3 + 1 brane moving in a 4 + 1 bulk spacetime with metric @xmath283 where we generalize @xcite to allow for a warping of the constant @xmath284 slices through @xmath285 .",
    "the points on the brane are parameterized by @xmath286 , and @xmath287 is the induced metric .",
    "taking the gaussian normal parameterization @xmath288 , we have @xmath289 the dirac - born - infeld action for the brane is @xmath290^{1/2 } ,   \\label{eq4.3}\\ ] ] and with the redefinitions @xmath291 we obtain @xmath292 for an unwarped bulk we obtain @xmath293 and @xmath294 , i.e. the simple chaplygin gas . in general , @xmath56 identifies @xmath295 with the tachyon model .",
    "if the brane also couples to , e.g. , bulk form fields , there are additional terms that are functions of @xmath70 only . thus every tachyon condensate model can be interpreted as a 3 + 1 brane moving in a 4 + 1 bulk .",
    "note that this is true _ only _ for ( [ eq4.5 ] ) or ( [ eq049 ] ) but _ not _ for ( [ eq048 ] ) .",
    "the prescription ( [ eq4.2 ] ) does not take into account the distortion of the bulk metric when the brane is not flat .",
    "this , however , can be accounted for using the methods of @xcite .",
    "given @xmath56 the warp factor can be reconstructed via @xmath296 for example , for the power - law potential @xmath297 we obtain @xmath298 using ( [ eq057 ] ) and writing @xmath299 , one finds @xmath300 which is the only fine tuning for @xmath301 and a small - scale extra dimension .",
