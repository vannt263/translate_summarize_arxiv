    "the understanding of quantum measurements has significantly advanced in recent years , in part due to the fast development of quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "measurements constitute a necessary part of the operation of a quantum computer . in the context of quantum computing",
    ", it is often implied that measurements are performed on individual two - state systems , qubits and that during measurements qubits are isolated from each other .",
    "however , in many proposed implementations of quantum computers the qubit - qubit coupling may not be completely turned off .",
    "the interest in measuring coupled systems is by no means limited to quantum computing ; however , qubits provide a convenient language for formulating the problem .    in a system of coupled qubits ( coupled quantum systems ) excitations",
    "are not entirely localized on individual qubits even where the qubits have different energies .",
    "therefore a one - qubit measurement may miss the excitation mostly localized on the qubit which is being measured .",
    "a measurement may also give a false - positive result : the detected excitation may be mostly localized on another qubit but have a tail on the measured qubit . in the context of quantum computing , this is a significant complication , since the overall error accumulates with the number of qubits .",
    "the most simple type of measurements which was essentially implied above is a fast von neumann - type projective measurement @xcite .",
    "alternatively one can use continuous measurements , in which the signal from the qubit is accumulated over time @xcite .",
    "they are often implemented as quantum non - demolition measurements ( qndms ) in which the quantity to be measured ( like population of the excited state ) is preserved while a conjugate quantity ( like phase ) is made uncertain .",
    "as we will see , the standard qndms do not solve the precision problem for interacting qubits .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to find a way of measuring nonresonantly coupled qubits that gives a parametrically smaller error than standard fast or continuous one - qubit measurements .",
    "the idea is to combine temporal and spectral selectivity so as to take advantage of different time and energy scales in the system .",
    "the proposed measurement is continuous .",
    "however , it is not of a qndm - type , both the qubit population and the phase of the qubit wave function are changed .",
    "we will consider the situation where excitations are strongly ( albeit incompletely ) localized on individual qubits , at least for the time that significantly exceeds the duration of a measurement .",
    "this can be accomplished by appropriately tuning the qubit energies @xmath0 . for one excitation , localization of stationary states",
    "is well - understood since anderson s work @xcite on disordered systems where @xmath0 are random .",
    "anderson localization requires that the bandwidth @xmath1 of the energies @xmath0 be much larger than the typical nearest - neighbor hopping integral @xmath2 .",
    "one - excitation localization becomes stronger for the same @xmath3 , i.e. , the localization length becomes smaller if @xmath0 are tuned in a regular way so as to suppress resonant excitation transitions .",
    "the problem of localization of multiple excitations is far more complicated because the number of states exponentially increases with the number of excitations .",
    "however , at least for a one - dimensional qubit system , by tuning @xmath0 one can still obtain strong localization of all excitations for a time @xmath4 @xcite ; here and below we set @xmath5 .",
    "we propose to detect an excitation by resonantly coupling the measured qubit ( mq ) to a detecting two - level system ( ds ) .",
    "if the mq was initially excited and the ds was in the ground state , the excitation can move to the ds .",
    "there its energy will be transferred to the reservoir , and the change of the state of the reservoir will be directly detected .",
    "for example , the ds can emit a photon that will be registered by a photodetector .",
    "the typical rate of photon emission @xmath6 should largely exceed the rate of resonant ( but incoherent ) excitation hopping from the mq to the ds , so that the probability for the excitation to go back onto the mq be small .",
    "the rate @xmath6 should also largely exceed the interaction - induced shift of the mq energy levels . at the same time",
    ", @xmath6 should be small compared to the bandwidth of site energies @xmath1 .",
    "then the qubits adjacent to the mq are not in resonance with the ds , and the rate of excitation transfer from these qubits to the ds is small .",
    "if the above conditions are met , there should be a time interval within which an excitation localized mostly on the mq will be detected with large probability , whereas excitations localized mostly on neighboring qubits will have a very small probability to trigger a detection signal . as we show , the associated errors are much smaller than in a projective measurement .    state measurements for coupled qubits have been performed with josephson - junction based systems , where there were studied oscillations of excitations between the qubits @xcite .",
    "the oscillations occurred where the qubits were tuned in resonance with each other .",
    "the effect of the interaction on measurements in the case of detuned qubits , which is of interest for the present work , was not analyzed .",
    "the approach proposed here , which combines spectral and temporal selectivity to enable high resolution is different not only from the standard continuous quantum measurements @xcite but also from other types of time - dependent quantum measurements , cf",
