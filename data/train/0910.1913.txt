    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the foundation for the utility of sne ia as a cosmological tool is that some distance - independent observables , such as the light - curve shape parameters @xcite , the color parameters @xcite , or both @xcite , have been found to correlate with their peak luminosity . these empirical correlations can be used to calibrate the luminosities of sne ia and measure their distances with a precision of @xmath19% .",
    "a recent result suggests that the luminosity standardization of sne ia can be improved to a level of @xmath16% by separating the sne into two groups based on a spectroscopic criterion [ for details , see @xcite , hereafter w09 ] .",
    "the expansion velocity ( @xmath0 ) of the sn ejecta is inferred from the blueshift of the absorption minimum of siii @xmath96355 , and the sne are divided into one group with normal @xmath0 ( hereafter  normal \" sne ia ) and the other group with high @xmath0 ( hereafter  hv \" sne ia ) .",
    "w09 found that the two groups have either different extinction laws or color evolution .",
    "the cause for such a dichotomy might be related to the properties of their progenitors .",
    "the hv sne ia are characterized by stronger absorption features of intermediate - mass elements ( imes , such as si , s , and ca ) at higher velocities as well as a red @xmath10 color around maximum brightness .",
    "sn 2002bo and sn 2006x are two of the best - studied examples of this class @xcite .",
    "in particular , the interstellar na i  d lines were found to show significant variations in the spectra of sn 2006x , likely pointing to the presence of csm produced by the progenitor system @xcite .",
    "the possible detection of csm around sn 2006x is also supported by a flat evolution of the late - time light curve @xcite and a detection of light echoes @xcite .",
    "similar variability of the na i  d lines was also observed in sne 1999cl and 2007le @xcite , two other members of the hv sn ia class .",
    "contrasting with this , multi - epoch , high - resolution spectral observations of sn 2007af , a normal sn ia , do not reveal any significant signature of csm absorption @xcite .",
    "this raises the possibility that csm might be preferentially present for the sne ia in the hv class .    in this paper",

    "sn 2007gi was discovered by k. itagaki ( iauc 8864 ) on july 23.49 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) at @xmath12 = 12@xmath1301@xmath1423@xmath15.4 , @xmath16 = + 61@xmath1753@xmath1833@xmath19.8 ( j2000.0 ) in the lenticular galaxy ngc 4036 .",
    "an optical spectrum taken on 2007 aug .",
    "4.90 revealed that sn 2007gi was a very young sn ia at a phase @xmath110 days before maximum brightness @xcite , with an expansion velocity measured from the absorption minimum of si  ii @xmath96355 as @xmath120,500 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this velocity is much higher than what is observed for a normal sn ia at a similar phase , but is typical for members of the hv sn ia class , such as sne 1983 g , 1997bp , and 2006x @xcite .",
    "photometry of sn 2007gi was obtained primarily with the 0.8-m tsinghua - naoc telescope ( tnt ) located at naoc xinglong observatory .",
    "this telescope is equipped with a @xmath20 pixel back - illuminated ccd , with a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath21 ( scale @xmath22 pixel@xmath2 ) .",
    "observations of sn 2007gi began on 2007 aug .",
    "8 , @xmath16 days before @xmath3-band maximum , and continued for the next 6 months .",
    "sn 2007gi was also observed during its early rising phase ( from @xmath23 to @xmath247 days ) with the ultraviolet / optical telescope [ uvot ; @xcite ] onboard the _ swift _ observatory .    as shown in figure 1 ,",
    "sn 2007gi is located just outside the central bulge of ngc 4036 . to remove the light contamination from the host galaxy , we applied an image - subtraction technique before performing the photometry .",
    "template images of ngc 4036 were obtained on 2008 may 24 , roughly 300 days after maximum brightness . to perform the image subtraction ,",
    "the image containing sn 2007gi is first geometrically registered to the corresponding template image ; the fluxes of the foreground stars in the images are then scaled to the same level .",
    "the point - spread functions ( psfs ) of these two images are convolved to match , and the template",
    "is then subtracted from the sn images .",
    "we finally performed standard psf - fitting photometry to obtain the instrumental magnitudes for the sn and the local standard stars with the iraf daophot package @xcite .",
    "transformations from the instrumental magnitudes to the standard johnson @xmath25 @xcite and kron - cousins @xmath26 @xcite systems were established by observing on photometric nights a series of @xcite standard stars covering a wide range of air masses and colors .",
    "a total of 4 photometric nights were used to calibrate 8 local standard stars in the field of sn 2007gi .",
    "table 1 lists their final calibrated @xmath11 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "these local stars are then used to transform the instrumental magnitudes of sn 2007gi to the standard @xmath11 system , and the final results of the photometry are listed in table 2 . the error bars ( in parentheses ) include both the uncertainty in the calibration of the local standard stars and the uncertainty of the instrumental magnitudes due to photon noise and image subtraction .    the @xmath3- and @xmath27-band magnitude obtained by uvot on three earlier epochs",
    "are also listed in table 2 .",
    "the swift / uvot photometry was reduced in a manner similar to that described in @xcite and using the photometric zeropoints of @xcite . in the absence of template images of the host galaxy",
    ", regions around the galaxy at the same distance from the nucleus as the sn were used to estimate the underlying count rate and its uncertainty .",
    "given the sparse spectroscopic observations of sn 2007gi (  4 ) , no @xmath28- or @xmath29-corrections were applied to the photometry presented in this paper .",
    "optical spectra of sn 2007gi were obtained primarily with the 3-m shane telescope at lick observatory using the kast double spectrograph @xcite .",
    "a spectrum was also obtained on 2007 nov .",
    "12 with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; @xcite ] mounted on the 10  m keck i telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the journal of spectroscopic observations is given in table 3 .",
    "all of the spectra were reduced by standard iraf routines . in order to avoid contamination from the host galaxy ,",
    "each spectrum of the sn was extracted carefully , and the flux calibration was done with spectra of standard stars observed on the same night at similar air masses .",
    "the spectra were corrected for continuum atmospheric extinction using mean extinction curves for lick observatory , and telluric lines were removed from the data . during the observations , the slit was always aligned near the parallactic angle to avoid chromatic losses due to atmospheric dispersion @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 light curves of sn 2007gi are presented in figure 2 . a polynomial fit to the @xmath3-band light curve around",
    "maximum brightness yields @xmath30 = 13.25@xmath40.04 mag on jd 2,454,327.02@xmath40.71 ( 2007 august 14.5 ) .",
    "this indicates that our observations started from about @xmath2411 days and extended to + 188 days with respect to the @xmath3-band maximum .",
    "the @xmath27-band light curve reached a peak magnitude of 13.08@xmath40.03 mag on jd 2,454,328.48@xmath40.72 , about 1.5 days after @xmath31(b ) .    using a template - fitting method [ similar to that used in hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996 ) but expanded to include more templates ] to fit the @xmath3- and @xmath27-band light curves , we derived @xmath32 = 1.31@xmath40.08 mag and @xmath33 = 0.17@xmath40.05 mag .",
    "the @xmath10 color around the maximum is found to be slightly redder than the unreddened loci @xcite , suggesting some reddening toward sn 2007gi .",
    "the salt2 method @xcite yields a best - fit stretch factor of @xmath34 = 0.88@xmath40.02 , which corresponds to @xmath35(b ) = 1.40@xmath40.10 from the transforming relation between @xmath34 and @xmath35(b ) by @xcite .",
    "the best - fit templates from mlcs2k2 @xcite are also overplotted in figure 2 .",
    "one can see that the light curves of sn 2007gi can be well fit by both salt2 and mlcs2k2 .    in figure 3 , we compare the light curves of sn 2007gi with those having similar @xmath32 values : sne 1994d @xcite , 1996x @xcite , 2002bo @xcite , 2002dj @xcite , 2002er @xcite , 2004eo @xcite , and 2006x @xcite . among these objects ,",
    "sne 2002bo , 2002dj , 2006x , and 2007gi belong to the hv group , while sne 1994d , 1996x , and 2004eo belong to the normal group .",
    "sn 2002er may be a transitional object linking the normal and hv groups ( w09 ) .",
    "compared to the normal sne ia in the @xmath3 band , sn 2007gi appears relatively brighter and declines slowly when entering the nebular phase . for convenience of comparison",
    ", we introduce a quantity @xmath36 , which is the flux ratio measured at @xmath37 and @xmath6 days with respect to the @xmath3 maximum .",
    "the ratio @xmath36 is found to be 19.9@xmath40.7 for sn 2007gi , which is similar to that of sn 2006x ( 17.2@xmath40.6 ) but noticeably smaller than that of sn 1994d ( 27.3@xmath40.6 ) , sn 1996x ( 25.4@xmath42.0 ) , and sn 2004eo ( 24.2@xmath41.2 ) .",
    "thus , the hv objects seem to have systematically smaller peak - to - tail contrast than the normal objects . close inspection of figure 3a also reveals that there may be a break in the light - curve evolution for sn 2007gi at @xmath38 days . the decay rate @xmath39 is found to be 1.16@xmath40.05 mag ( 100 days)@xmath2 during the period from @xmath40 days to @xmath41 days , similar to that measured for sn 1984a and sn 2002bo at the same phase . the decay becomes steeper after @xmath41 days , with @xmath39 = 1.61@xmath40.04 mag ( 100 days)@xmath2 .",
    "such a two - stage evolution also exists in sn 2006x , but it is not unambiguously present in the cases of sne 1984a and 2002bo due to poor photometric coverage in the nebular phase .",
    "future observations will be needed to determine whether this trend is universal for all hv sne ia .    in contrary to the @xmath3-band light curve",
    ", the @xmath42-band light curves of sn 2007gi do not exhibit a two - stage evolution in the nebular phase ( see figure 3b  d ) . neither the flux contrast between the tail and peak nor the decay rate of the tail show significant differences among the objects in the comparison .",
    "a noticeable difference is that the secondary shoulder / maximum features at around + 25 days in the @xmath42 bands appear more pronounced in the hv objects than those in the normal ones ( see figures 3c and 3d ) .",
    "part of this effect could be caused by significant extinction which shifts the effective passband to redder wavelengths [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "as the extinction suffered by sn 2007gi is relatively low (  3.2 ) , its prominent secondary shoulder is likely to be mostly intrinsic .",
    "according to @xcite , the variation of the secondary maximum of the near - infrared ( nir ) light curves is caused by the abundance stratification in sne ia and/or the progenitor metallicity .",
    "one feature in figures 3(a)(d ) , though not easily discernible due to the crowdness of the data points , is that the hv sne 2007gi , 2006x , and 2002bo seem to rise to the maximum at a faster rate than the normal objects .",
    "such a trend was also mentioned by @xcite in the qualitative comparison of sn 2002dj .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the rise time is given in  3.3 .",
    "figure 4 presents the optical color curves of sn 2007gi ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) .",
    "overplotted are the color curves of the other sne in the light - curve comparison in figure 3 .",
    "all of the color curves are shifted to match the observed values of sn 2007gi at @xmath3 maximum . for the @xmath10 color",
    ", sn 2007gi exhibited a similar color evolution as the other sne in the early phase ( @xmath46 days ) . at @xmath47 days , it has the reddest color of all the sne .",
    "after the red peak at @xmath48 25 days , sn 2007gi seems to become progressively bluer than the other sne in the comparison , so by @xmath40 days it has the bluest color .",
    "unfortunately , there is a gap in the range @xmath4960 days when sn 2007gi was behind the sun , so the detailed evolution during this phase is not clear .",
    "the slope measured during @xmath690 days is @xmath50 mag day@xmath2 , steeper than the lira - phillips relation [ e.g. , @xmath51 mag day@xmath2 ; @xcite ] .",
    "this was also noticed by @xcite in the comparison study of sn 2006x .",
    "in fact , a steeper @xmath10 color - change slope than the lira - phillips relation in the nebular phase is found to be the case for most of the hv events ( wang , x. , et al .",
    "2009c , in preparation ) , suggesting that the reddening derived for them from their tail colors might be potentially biased toward a lower value .",
    "despite the relatively large differences seen in the @xmath10 color evolution , the two classes of sne ia ( hv and normal ) share similar @xmath52 and @xmath53 color evolution ( figures 4b  c ) .",
    "the galactic extinction toward ngc 4036/sn 2007gi is @xmath54 mag @xcite , corresponding to a color excess of @xmath55 mag [ adopting the standard reddening law of @xcite ] .",
    "the peak @xmath10 color , corrected for the galactic reddening , is 0.15@xmath40.05 mag .",
    "this corresponds to a host - galaxy reddening of @xmath56 mag under the assumption that the hv sne ia have intrinsic @xmath10 colors similar to those of the normal objects near maximum brightness ( w09 ) .",
    "assuming @xmath57 , as suggested by w09 for the hv sne ia , the extinction caused by the dust within the host galaxy of sn 2007gi is @xmath58 mag",
    ".      the late - time evolution of sne can provide valuable constraints on the sn environments as well as their explosion models [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "the field of sn 2007gi was imaged with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) onboard the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ on 2009 march 26 , @xmath1600 days after discovery , as part of _ hst _ program go-10877 ( pi : weidong li ) .",
    "a cosmic - ray - split pair of observations was observed with each of the f435w , f555w , f675w , and f814w filters . to locate sn 2007gi on these wfpc2 images",
    ", we follow the technique detailed by @xcite .",
    "we use an @xmath8-band image of sn 2007gi taken with the lick observatory 1-m nickel telescope on 2007 dec .",
    "15 , and identify four stars that are present in the wfpc2 images .",
    "an astrometric solution using these four stars yields a relatively poor precision of @xmath59 due to the faintness of the stars and the resolution of the nickel image .",
    "nevertheless , within the 1@xmath60 error radius of the astrometric solution , we identify a single star which we presume to be sn 2007gi .",
    "figure 5 demonstrates this process .    to measure the magnitudes of sn 2007gi in the wfpc2 images",
    ", we have used the ",
    "hstphot \" package developed by @xcite . after performing the preprocessing suggested by the hstphot manual , including removal of cosmic rays , defects , bad pixels , and hot pixels",
    ", we measure the magnitudes in the wfpc2 system .",
    "these magnitudes are then converted to the ground - based broad - band @xmath11 magnitudes using the procedure described by @xcite .",
    "we measure the following magnitudes for sn 2007gi : @xmath3 = 24.49@xmath40.10 , @xmath27 = 24.20@xmath40.13 , @xmath8 = 24.63@xmath40.28 , and @xmath61 = 23.50@xmath40.12 .",
    "sn 2007gi was found to decline by @xmath111.1 mag in the @xmath27 band by 590 days after the @xmath3 maximum .",
    "this flux drop is consistent with the corresponding values observed in sn 1996x and sn 2003hv at comparable phases @xcite .",
    "sn 1991 t and 1998bu , which showed evidence for the presence of light echoes @xcite , declined by @xmath62 mag within 590 days since the maximum .",
    "in addition , the @xmath10 color of sn 2007gi in the nebular phase is found to be inconsistent with that predicted by the light - echo scenario . thus .",
    "we conclude that an interstellar echo may not be present in sn 2007gi .      the time spent by a sn from explosion to maximum brightness",
    "is defined as the rise time @xmath63 , an important parameter that links the explosion physics to the progenitors of sne  ia @xcite .",
    "the rise time of a sn ia is determined primarily by the rate at which the interior energy is released and subsequently diffuses to the surface of the supernova .",
    "assuming that the luminosity of a sn ia evolves as an expanding fireball at very early phases @xcite , the rise time @xmath63 can be derived from the relation @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath12 is the `` speed '' of the rise of the luminosity and @xmath65 is the time elapsed since maximum brightness .    in this subsection , we attempt to examine the difference in @xmath66 between hv and normal sne ia .",
    "instead of adopting the @xmath3-band light curve @xcite , our analysis uses the @xmath8-band light curve , as our earliest photometric data points are usually obtained with a clear filter ( used in our sn search ) which is very close to broad - band @xmath8 @xcite . only those data obtained earlier than one week before the @xmath8-band maximum are used in the fitting .",
    "the computed rise times for sn 2007gi and several other well - observed sne ia are plotted against the decline rate @xmath5 in figure 6 .",
    "the sne are divided into the hv ( filled circles ) and normal ( open squares ) groups according to the classification scheme defined by w09 . in each group",
    ", @xmath63 correlates with @xmath32 : slower decliners have longer rise times .",
    "the hv sne ia appear to have a faster ( i.e. , shorter ) rise time than the normal ones at the same @xmath32 with the exception of sn 1994d , which lacks published photometry during the very early phases .",
    "a similar trend was also noted by @xcite .",
    "assuming comparable amounts of nickel are synthesized during the explosion , the rise time of a sn ia is affected by the efficiency of the photon diffusion , which depends on the opacity and the location of the photosphere .",
    "a shorter @xmath63 could indicate that compared with a normal sn ia , the photosphere of a hv sn ia is less effectively heated by the @xmath67-ray photons inside the ejecta , or becomes optically thin at a faster pace due to the more rapid expansion ( see the discussion in  4.3 ) .",
    "we have 5 optical spectra of sn 2007gi obtained with the 3.0-m shane telescope at lick observatory and the keck i 10-m telescope at the w. m. keck observatory , spanning from @xmath68 to @xmath69  days since @xmath3-band maximum brightness .",
    "as shown in figure 7 , the spectral evolution around maximum brightness generally follows that of a normal sn  ia but is characterized by very broad and highly blueshifted absorption features at 3600  (ca  ii h&k ) , 6000    ( si  ii @xmath96355 ) , and 8000    ( ca  ii nir triplet ) .      in figure 8 , we compare the spectra of sn 2007gi with those of sne  ia having similar @xmath35 values at four selected epochs ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 , + 6 , and + 3 months since the @xmath3 maximum ) .",
    "all spectra have been corrected for the reddening and the redshifts of the host galaxies .",
    "the reddening of each comparison sn  ia is taken from table 1 in w09 , and the @xmath72 value is assumed to be 1.57 for the hv sne ia and 2.36 for the normal objects according to the analysis w09 .    at @xmath73 days ( figure 8a ) , the spectrum of sn 2007gi is characterized by lines of singly ionized imes ( si , s , mg , and ca ) . the absorption features of si  ii @xmath96355 and ca ii h&k in sn 2007gi are deep and broad , comparable to those in the hv sn ia 2002bo but significantly stronger than those in the normal sne 1994d , 2002er , and 2004eo .",
    "around maximum brightness ( figure 8b ) , we measured a line - strength ratio of si  ii @xmath95972 to si  ii @xmath96355 , known as @xmath74(si  ii ) @xcite , to be @xmath75 for sn 2007gi .",
    "this is a relatively small @xmath74(si  ii ) value and usually indicates an overluminous event @xcite .",
    "similar low values of @xmath74(si  ii ) are observed for the other two hv objects , sne 2006x and 2002bo .    by one week",
    "after maximum ( figure 8c ) , the strong absorptions of si  ii and ca  ii lines are still present in the hv objects ( sne 2007gi , 2002bo , 2002dj , and 2006x ) , but the w - shape s  ii lines have almost vanished . at @xmath76 months ( figure 8d ) ,",
    "the spectra are dominated by iron lines whose strength is similar in all of the objects , and a strong ca  ii nir absorption trough .",
    "sn 2006x was found to show a prominent near - uv excess starting from @xmath77 days , perhaps due to a local light echo or an interaction of the sn ejecta with circumstellar material @xcite .",
    "close inspection of the @xmath78 day spectrum of sn 2007gi reveals a flux excess at the blue end when compared to the normal sne  ia , consistent with its bluer @xmath79 color at this phase (  3.2 ) .",
    "the blueshift of the absorption minima of some spectral features may approximately trace the location of the photosphere in the early phases of a sn . in this subsection",
    ", we examine some strong lines such as si  ii @xmath96355 and ca  ii h & k , as well as a weak line s  ii @xmath95640 .",

    "these high @xmath0 values of the imes ( si , s , and ca ) can often be interpreted as being caused by a density / abundance enhancement in the outer ejecta of the sne @xcite .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed to account for such an enhancement .",
    "the metallicity effect was examined by @xcite , who found that increasing the metallicity in the c+o layers by a factor of 10 is still far from explaining the high @xmath0 seen in sn 2002bo .",
    "the delayed detonation models were proposed to explain the hv features in sn 1984a and sn 2002bo @xcite , as intense nucleosynthesis in the outer layers results in an enhancement of the density of the imes at higher velocities , which subsequently increases the opacity in the outer regions and results in a photosphere that is moving at a high velocity .",
    "an interaction between the sn ejecta and csm could produce the high - velocity ca  ii lines @xcite and may also affect the si  ii lines @xcite .",
    "detailed analysis of the reasons for the hv features is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the flux ratio @xmath74(si  ii ) between si  ii @xmath95972 and si  ii @xmath96355 is an indicator of the photospheric temperature and the luminosity of a sn  ia : a value of @xmath74(si  ii ) means a more luminous sn  ia with a higher photospheric temperature .",
    "the unusually low @xmath74(si  ii ) value of @xmath10.07 for sn 2007gi at @xmath80 day thus suggests a rather high photospheric temperature . on the other hand , the strength of si  iii @xmath94560 (",
    "actually si  iii @xmath824553 , 4568 ) has been proposed as another photospheric temperature tracer @xcite , and is stronger for a sn  ia having a higher temperature .",
    "the si  iii @xmath94560 line is weak in sn 2007gi , suggesting a rather low photospheric temperature .",
    "the two temperature indicators thus provide conflicting results for sn 2007gi .    in an attempt to further constrain the photospheric temperature in sn 2007gi",
    ", we used the parameterized resonance scattering synthetic - spectrum code synow @xcite to fit the near - maximum spectra of sn 2007gi .",
    "the basic input parameters are taken from table 1 in @xcite , with the blackbody temperature @xmath83 and the velocity at the photosphere @xmath84 as free parameters .",
    "figure 10 shows our best synow fit for the @xmath80 day spectrum , with @xmath84 = 15,500 km s@xmath2 and @xmath85  k. the high @xmath84 is consistent with the high @xmath0 measured directly from the spectrum (  4.2 ) .",
    "the blackbody temperature @xmath83 , on the other hand , is rather typical of other sne  ia at this phase .",
    "for example , @xcite estimated @xmath86  k for the normal sn ia 1994d at @xmath87 day , while our best synow fit to a spectrum of the normal sn ia 2004eo at @xmath88 day yields @xmath89  k.    our synow analysis thus suggests that @xmath74(si  ii ) is not a good photospheric temperature indicator for the hv sne  ia .",
    "the exact cause for this is not clear .",
    "one possibility is contamination by fe  ii and fe  iii lines .",
    "@xcite suggested that the fe lines might weaken the si  ii @xmath95972 absorption line even at low @xmath83 .",
    "in this paper , we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of sn 2007gi , a sn  ia with an extremely high expansion velocity measured from imes ( si , ca , and s ) . we also conduct a comparison study for a sample of sne  ia with high and normal expansion velocities ( hv and normal , respectively ) to investigate differences in their photometric and spectroscopic behaviors .",
    "the @xmath3-band light curve of sn 2007gi shows a two - stage evolution : a decay rate of @xmath90 mag ( 100  days)@xmath2 during @xmath9190 days and @xmath92 ( 100  days)@xmath2 thereafter .",
    "the latter decay rate is similar to those observed in normal sne ia .",
    "this two - stage evolution is also present in the hv sn ia 2006x .",
    "more late - time observations of the hv objects are necessary to establish whether this is a universal property .",
    "the @xmath93 color of sn 2007gi is found to evolve at a faster slope than that of normal sne ia during the nebular phase , a trend that is also observed for the hv sn ia 2006x @xcite and most of the other hv events ( wang , x. , et al .",
    "2009c , in preparation ) .",
    "sn 2007gi was detected at @xmath94 days after @xmath3 maximum in _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 images . the magnitudes and colors at this very late - time epoch suggest that sn 2007gi may not be contaminated by a light echo on interstellar scales .",
    "using a dozen well - observed sne ia , we confirm the previous claim that hv sne ia tend to have a faster rise time than normal sne ia @xcite : at the same value of @xmath35 , the rise time of the hv objects is shorter than that of the normal objects by 12 days .",
    "the spectral evolution of sn 2007gi is characterized by high expansion velocities measured from the absorption lines .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is measured to be 15,500 km s@xmath2 at @xmath80 day , @xmath150% higher than what is observed for normal sne ia . a small flux ratio @xmath74(si  ii ) = 0.07@xmath40.03",
    "is observed , which traditionally means a hot photospheric temperature in the sn ejecta .",
    "our synthetic spectral analysis using the synow code , on the other hand , suggests that sn 2007gi has a typical photospheric temperature compared with other normal sne ia .",
    "the two - stage evolution in the @xmath3-band light curve of sn 2007gi may suggest that an additional energy source besides radioactive decay plays a role in the nebular phase .",
    "dust scattering ( a light echo ) seems unlikely because the tail luminosity would have remained nearly constant for a long time , which is not the case for sn 2007gi .",
    "nevertheless , the possibility of a local light echo on a small scale ( due to csm dust ) can not be completely ruled out .",
    "another potential energy source is interaction with csm ; detection of variable sodium lines in the spectra of some hv events provides some evidence for this scenario . assuming that the csm lies at a distance of @xmath95 cm from the supernova , it is expected that the outermost ejecta will begin to interact with the csm at @xmath130 days after the @xmath3 maximum .",
    "this naturally accounts for a flatter evolution seen in the @xmath3-band light curve of the hv sne ia after @xmath96 days .",
    "the difficulty with this scenario is the lack of convincing observational evidence for stripped material , such as low - velocity h@xmath12 emission in the nebular spectra [ e.g. , @xcite , but see @xcite for alternative explanations regarding the observed lack of hydrogen ] , and the lack of spectral evidence in support of ongoing csm interaction .",
    "a possible explanation for the hv features observed in the hv sne ia is that there are density enhancements of the imes in the outer layers of the ejecta of the hv objects ( due to a metallicity effect , delayed detonations , or csm interaction ) ; the @xmath67-ray heating is less effective , and the photosphere is formed at an outer layer with a higher expansion velocity compared to the normal objects .",

    "<S> we present optical photometry and spectra for the type ia supernova ( sn ia ) 2007gi in the nearby galaxy ngc 4036 . </S>",
    "<S> sn 2007gi is characterized by extremely high - velocity ( hv ) features of the intermediate - mass elements ( si , ca , and s ) , with expansion velocities ( @xmath0 ) approaching @xmath115,500 km s@xmath2 near maximum brightness ( compared to @xmath110,600 km s@xmath2 for sne ia with normal @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> sn 2007gi reached a @xmath3-band peak magnitude of 13.25@xmath40.04 mag with a decline rate of @xmath5(true ) = 1.33@xmath40.09 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3-band light curve of sn 2007gi demonstrated an interesting two - stage evolution during the nebular phase , with a decay rate of 1.16@xmath40.05 mag ( 100 days)@xmath2 during @xmath690 days and 1.61@xmath7 mag ( 100 days)@xmath2 thereafter . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior was also observed in the hv sn ia 2006x , and might be caused by the interaction between supernova ejecta and circumstellar material ( csm ) around hv sne ia . </S>",
    "<S> based on a sample of a dozen well - observed @xmath8-band ( or unfiltered ) light curves of sne ia , we confirm that the hv events may have a faster rise time to maximum than the ones with normal @xmath0 . </S>"
