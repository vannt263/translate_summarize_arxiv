    "since stars belonging to a cluster are considered to have formed almost at the same time out of chemically near - homogeneous material , spectroscopically studying the photospheric abundances of cluster stars can provide us with valuable information on the primordial gas ( chemical composition , degree of homogeneity , etc . ) as well as physical processes that may posteriori affect surface abundances ( e.g. , mixing / segregation in the stellar envelope ) .",

    "2000 ) , the issue of how this anomaly ( am peculiarity ) is triggered is still somewhat controversial ( i.e. , only the rotational velocity is responsible ? or some other factors are involved ? ) .",

    "section 4 ) .",
    "although the convergence of the solutions turned out fairly successful for most of the cases , we encountered with some cases where convergence was poor ( e.g. , oscillatory ) or abundance solution of some specific element even became unstable and divergent . when any abundance parameter could not be established , we fixed it at the solar value and retried the calculation .",
    "after the solutions have been established , we checked by eye whether the synthetic theoretical spectrum satisfactorily matches the observed spectrum .",
    "if the convergence of any abundance solution was not sufficiently good , or if the consistency between theoretical and observed spectrum did not appear satisfactorily good at the relevant line position , we judged this abundance solution to be of `` low reliability . ''",

    "while the lte abundances of @xmath76(o ) , @xmath76(li ) , and @xmath76(c ) obtained by these spectrum - fitting analyses are not explicitly given , they are easily derived from the non - lte abundances ( @xmath77 ) and the non - lte corrections ( @xmath78 ) ( both given in electronic table e1 ) as @xmath79 .",
    "it would be appropriate here to remark that the solution of the macrobroadening parameter ( @xmath67 ) derived as a by - product of spectrum fitting can be a fairly good indicator of projected rotational velocity ( @xmath80 ) , on the condition that @xmath80 is not too small .",
    "if the rotational velocity is large and spectral lines show rounded shapes , we used equation ( 3 ) ( rotational broadening function ) , and this choice corresponds to the solutions of @xmath81  km  s@xmath9 ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) . in this case , @xmath67 can naturally be regarded as essentially equivalent to @xmath17 , since the contributions of instrumental broadening and macroturbulence ( both are on the order of several km  s@xmath9 ) are anyhow negligible compared to this extent .",
    "further , we would point out that @xmath67 is still a good approximation of @xmath17 also for the slower rotation case where we used equation ( 4 ) ( gaussian broadening function ) .",
    "this is because , if we require that the fwhms of the rotation function ( @xmath82 ) and the gaussian function ( @xmath83 $ ] ) be equal , we obtain the relation @xmath84 ( cf . footnote 12 of takeda et al . 2008 ) , which guarantees a practical equality between these two .",
    "so , as far as @xmath17 is not so small compared with the instrumental width or the macroturbulence width , @xmath85 is not a bad approximation , irrespective of the adopted broadening functions .",
    "it should be bear in mind , however , that this relation does not hold any more at @xmath86  km  s@xmath9 where the contributions of the instrumental width as well as the macroturbulence width become progressively important , though @xmath67 might still be regarded as a `` qualitative measure '' of @xmath80 even in such a slow - rotator regime .",

    "we note in figure 14e that @xmath14(li ) at @xmath145  k ( on the higher @xmath0 side out of the li chasm ) is almost the solar - system abundance of @xmath14(li)@xmath146 = 3.31 .",
    "takeda et al .

    "the c and o abundances of main - sequence stars in the hyades cluster are not yet well established despite their astrophysical importance , for which a number of previous studies reported different results .",
    "also , the abundances of li ( key element for investigating the physical process in the envelope ) and fe ( representative of metallicity ) are worth reinvestigation by taking this opportunity . motivated by this situation , we decided to carry out a systematic abundance study of these elements for hyades main - sequence stars in the @xmath0 range of @xmath1  50007000  k.    practically , we derived these abundances by applying a spectrum - synthesis analysis to four spectral regions at 60806089  @xmath33 , 67076709  @xmath33 , 71107121  @xmath33 , and 61576159  @xmath33 ( comprising lines of fe - group elements , li  i 6708 line , c  i 71117119 lines , and o  i 61568 lines , respectively ) based on the high - dispersion spectra of 68 selected hyades f  g type stars obtained with the 188  cm reflector and the hides spectrograph at okayama astrophysical observatory .    it turned out that these c , o , and fe abundances similarly exhibit a marginal @xmath0-dependent gradient ( i.e. , slightly increasing with a decrease in @xmath0 ; typically on the order of @xmath8  dex  k@xmath9 ) although this might be nothing but an apparent effect due to an improper choice of atmospheric parameters , we found it hard to give a quantitatively reasonable explanation .",
    "apart from this small systematic gradient , the abundances of c , o , and fe in these hyades stars were found to be fairly uniform and marginally supersolar with only a small scatter of @xmath107  dex : @xmath2[c / h]@xmath3  @xmath4 , @xmath2[o / h]@xmath5  @xmath6 , and @xmath2[fe / h]@xmath7  @xmath4 , suggesting that the primordial abundances are almost retained .",
    "regarding li , we confirmed the well - known @xmath0-dependent trend in the li abundances of hyades f  g stars reported so far ( i.e. , a conspicuous li - trough at 6700  k  @xmath132  k and a progressive decline with a decrease in @xmath0 below @xmath158  k ) . since @xmath14(li ) at 7000  k  @xmath150  k ( a zone encompassed by the deficiency of li in a / am stars and the li chasm of f stars ) is almost the solar - system abundance , the li depletion mechanism seen in a - type stars is considered to be different from the physical process responsible for the li gap of hyades f - type stars .    we concluded that the the surface li of hyades stars is essentially controlled only by @xmath0 and other parameters such as the rotational velocity are almost irrelevant . a positive correlation between @xmath14(li ) and stellar rotation , which is observed in field solar - analog stars , is not seen in these younger early g - type stars of the hyades cluster .",

    "<S> in an attempt to carry out a systematic study on the behavior of the photospheric abundances of li , c , and o ( along with fe ) for hyades main - sequence stars in the @xmath0 range of @xmath1  50007000  k , we conducted an extensive spectrum - synthesis analysis applied to four spectral regions ( comprising lines of fe - group elements , li  i 6708 line , c  i 71117119 lines , and o  i 61568 lines ) based on the high - dispersion spectra of 68 selected f  g type stars belonging to this cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the abundances of c and o turned out to be fairly uniform in a marginally supersolar level such like the case of fe : @xmath2[c / h]@xmath3  @xmath4 , @xmath2[o / h]@xmath5  @xmath6 , and @xmath2[fe / h]@xmath7  @xmath4 , suggesting that the primordial abundances are almost retained for these elements . </S>",
    "<S> strictly , however , they show a slightly increasing trend with a decrease in @xmath0 ( typically on the order of @xmath8  dex  k@xmath9 ) ; while this might be due to an improper choice of atmospheric parameters , we found it hard to give a quantitatively reasonable explanation . </S>",
    "<S> regarding li , we confirmed the well - known @xmath0-dependent trend in the li abundance reported so far ( a conspicuous li - trough at 6300  k  @xmath10  k and a progressive decrease toward a lower @xmath0 at @xmath11  k ) , which means that the surface li of hyades stars is essentially controlled only by @xmath0 and other parameters such as the rotational velocity are almost irrelevant . </S>"
