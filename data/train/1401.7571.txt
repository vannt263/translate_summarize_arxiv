    "with the atmospheres of exoplanets now accessible to astronomical scrutiny , there is motivation to understand the basic physics governing their structure .",
    "since highly - irradiated exoplanets are most amenable to atmospheric characterization , a growing body of work has focused on hot earths / neptunes / jupiters , ranging from analytical models to simulations of atmospheric circulation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in one , two and three dimensions ( 1d , 2d and 3d ) . the path towards full understanding requires the construction of a hierarchy of theoretical models of varying sophistication @xcite . in this context ,",
    "analytical models have a vital role to play , since they provide crisp physical insight and are immune to numerical issues ( e.g. , numerical viscosity , sub - grid physics , spin - up ) .",
    "atmospheres behave like heat engines .",
    "sources of forcing ( e.g. , stellar irradiation ) induce atmospheric motion , which are eventually damped out by sources of friction ( e.g. , viscosity , magnetic drag ) .",
    "it is essential to understand atmospheric dynamics , as it sets the background state of velocity , temperature , density and pressure that determines the spectral and temporal appearance of an atmosphere .",
    "it also determines whether an atmosphere attains or is driven away from chemical , radiative and thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "even if an atmosphere is not in equilibrium , it must be in a global state of equipoise  sources of forcing and friction negate one another ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the present study , this is our over - arching physical goal : to analytically derive the global , steady state of an exoplanetary atmosphere ( the  exoclime \" ) in the presence of forcing , friction , rotation and magnetic fields .",
    "-plane ( pseudo - spherical geometry ) and in full spherical geometry .",
    "the key quantity to solve for is the meridional ( north - south ) velocity , from which the zonal ( east - west ) velocity , shallow water height perturbation and magnetic field perturbations straightforwardly follow . ]",
    "[ fig : schematic ]    shallow water models are a decisive way of studying exoclimes .",
    "the term  shallow water \" comes from their traditional use in meteorology and oceanography @xcite and refers to the approximation that the horizontal extent modeled far exceeds the vertical / radial one .",
    "they have been used to understand the solar tacocline @xcite , the atmospheres of neutron stars @xcite and exoplanetary atmospheres @xcite .",
    "our over - arching technical goal is to perform a comprehensive theoretical survey across dimensionality ( 1d and 2d ) , geometry ( cartesian , pseudo - spherical and spherical ) and sources of friction ( molecular viscosity , rayleigh drag and magnetic drag ) for forced , damped , rotating , magnetized systems . to retain algebraic tractability , we study the limits of purely vertical / radial or horizontal / toroidal background magnetic fields .",
    "our main finding is that the global structure of exoplanetary atmospheres is largely controlled by a single , key parameter  at least in the shallow water approximation  which we denote by @xmath0 . in the hydrodynamic limit , @xmath0",
    "is directly related to the rossby and prandtl numbers . in forced ,",
    "damped atmospheres with non - ideal mhd , @xmath0 encapsulates the effects of molecular viscosity , rayleigh drag , forcing , magnetic tension and magnetic drag .      due to the technical nature of the present study",
    ", we find it useful to concisely summarize a set of terminology that we will use throughout the paper .    from a set of perturbed equations",
    ", we will obtain wave solutions for the velocity , height and magnetic field perturbations .",
    "we assume that the waves have a temporal component of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the wave frequency .",
    "generally , the wave frequency has real and imaginary components ( @xmath3 ) , which describe the oscillatory and growing or decaying parts of the wave , respectively . for each model",
    ", we will obtain a pair of equations describing @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which we call the  oscillatory dispersion relation \" and the  growth / decay dispersion relation \" , respectively",
    ". we will refer to them collectively as  dispersion relations \" .",
    "a  balanced flow \" corresponds to the situation when @xmath6 .",
    "the  steady state \" of an atmosphere has @xmath7 .",
    "we will refer to molecular viscosity , rayleigh drag and magnetic drag collectively as  friction \" .",
    "if we are only considering molecular viscosity and rayleigh drag , we will use the term  hydrodynamic friction \" .",
    "we will use the terms  friction \" and  damping \" interchangeably , but not qualify the latter as being hydrodynamic or mhd in nature .",
    "we will refer to systems as being  free \" if forcing and friction are absent .",
    "similarly , we will use the terms  fast \" and  rapid \" interchangeably when referring to rotation .",
    "the zeroth order effect of including a magnetic field introduces a term each into the momentum and magnetic induction equations  we will refer to the effects of these ideal - mhd terms as  magnetic tension \" .",
    "when non - ideal mhd is considered , we include a resistive term in the induction equation that mathematically resembles diffusion  we will refer to its influence as  magnetic drag \" .    we will examine an approximation for including the effects of non - constant rotation , across latitude , on a cartesian grid , known traditionally as the  @xmath8-plane approximation \" ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "note that this is _ not _ the same as a departure from solid body rotation .",
    "rather , it is an approximation to include the dynamical effects of sphericity .",
    "there are two flavors of this approximation : the simpler version solves for waves that are oscillatory in both spatial dimensions ( simply called  @xmath8-plane \" ) , while a more sophisticated version allows for an arbitrary functional dependence in latitude (  equatorial @xmath8-plane \" ) .",
    "since the equatorial @xmath8-plane treatment more closely approximates the situation on a sphere , we will refer to it as being  pseudo - spherical \" .    in constructing the mathematical machinery in this paper",
    ", we often have to evaluate long , complex expressions . to this end",
    ", we find it convenient to separate out the real and imaginary components using a series of  separation functions \" , which we denote by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the definitions of these dimensionless quantities vary from model to model .",
    "we note that @xmath14 also functions like a generalized friction that includes magnetic tension .",
    "in  [ sect : equations ] , we state the governing equations and derive their linearized , perturbed forms . in  [ sect:1d ] , we review and extend the 1d models .",
    "we extend our models to 2d cartesian geometry in  [ sect:2d ] and begin to consider the effects of sphericity in  [ sect:2d_beta ] . in  [ sect : spherical ] , we present results for 2d models in spherical geometry .",
