    "the perturbed two - body problem is one of the central areas of interest of celestial mechanics .",
    "a wide class of perturbations of the dynamics of a binary system are described by the generic brumberg force [ @xcite ] .",
    "another type of perturbation is provided by general relativistic modifications of gravitational dynamics .",
    "such measurable effects arise in planetary motion ( like the general relativistic contribution to the precession of the perihelion of the planet mercury ) , however more important are the modifications in the strong - field regime , typically appearing in compact binaries composed of neutron stars and / or black holes .",
    "a well - known example is the hulse - taylor double pulsar [ @xcite ] , the orbital period of which is continuously decreasing as gravitational radiation escapes from the system [ @xcite ] ( for a recent review see [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "efforts to directly detect gravitational waves with earth - based interferometric detectors ( ligo[@xcite ] , virgo [ @xcite ] , geo [ @xcite ] and tama [ @xcite ] ) are currently under way .",
    "gravitational waves from distant coalescing galactic black hole binaries will be searched for by the forthcoming laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) [ @xcite ] . with improving detector sensitivity , upper limits for the signal emitted by different configurations of gravitational wave sources",
    "were already set ( [ @xcite ] , [ @xcite ] , [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "capturing gravitational waves in the noisy background requires a 3.5 post - newtonian ( pn ) accuracy both in the orbital phase [ @xcite ] and in the energy loss [ @xcite ] occurring in a compact binary .",
    "the backreaction of the escaping gravitational radiation on the orbit decreases the orbital period of the compact binary .",
    "although higher order corrections to this effect are too small to be directly detected in the early stages of the inspiral , they are important in the latter stages , when the post - newtonian parameter increases up to @xmath0 ( at @xmath1 gravitational radii separation ) and higher order contributions become quite significant . therefore the contributions to the energy loss @xmath2 and angular momentum loss @xmath3 have been worked out up to 2pn order accuracy in the wave generation ( or equivalently , to 4.5 pn order following the keplerian picture ) , in the case of eccentric orbits , and up to even higher orders for circular orbits .",
    "( here @xmath4 denotes the time - average over one period , e.g. a secular contribution . )",
    "the corrections arise at each pn order from both general relativistic modifications of the dynamics and/or as a manifestation of various physical characteristics of the system , like the spins , mass quadrupole momenta and magnetic dipole momenta of the constituents .",
    "the final aim of gravitational wave astronomy is to incorporate all of these physical characteristics into accurate templates to be used in data processing .",
    "recovering the physical characteristics of astronomical objects from a simultaneous analysis of data collected in both the electromagnetic spectrum and gravitational wave bandwidth would be a major breakthrough in modern astronomy .    driven by this motivation",
    ", the interest in the perturbed two - body problem has been renewed . in this context , in [ @xcite ] a generic perturbed two - body problem with radial equation @xmath5 was considered .",
    "the point mass @xmath6 ( representing the reduced mass of the binary ) is orbiting a fixed gravitational centre @xmath7 ( the total mass of the system ) at distance @xmath8 ( the separation of the components ) .",
    "the energy @xmath9 and the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum @xmath10 are constants of the _ perturbed _ motion and @xmath10 from the rest of the coefficients of @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the radial equation is advantageous , as it will enable us to express all results in terms of constants with physical interpretation . ] .",
    "the expression @xmath13 ( the subscript @xmath14 denoting newtonian ) has the familiary newtonian functional form , however @xmath9 and @xmath10 characterize the perturbed motion .",
    "the perturbing terms contain the small coefficients @xmath15 , assumed _ constants_. as will be shown in detail in section 3 , both the generic perturbing brumberg force , the first post - newtonian order ( 1pn ) general relativistic corrections [ @xcite ] and the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction for compact binaries [ @xcite ] fit into this scheme .",
    "the generic equation ( [ radial ] ) defines a radial period @xmath16 and turning points @xmath17 .    with these assumptions the integrals of the type @xmath18 ( with constant @xmath19 and @xmath20 arbitrary integer )",
    "could be easily evaluated by use of the _ residue theorem_. important steps in the proof of [ @xcite ] were the introduction of suitable generalized true and eccentric anomaly parametrizations of the radial motion , @xmath21 and @xmath22 as @xmath23 together with their complex counterpart @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the advantage of this method over other methods for computing the secular integrals ( [ integral ] ) is its striking simplicity .",
    "as proven in [ @xcite ] , in the majority of physically relevant cases the only pole is in the origin .",
    "extremely rarely , a second pole ( also given ) occurs .",
    "the method was successfully applied in [ @xcite ] for the evaluation of the averaged energy and angular momentum losses due to the so interaction for compact binaries on elliptic orbit , and the results were in agreement with those of [ @xcite ] , obtained by a different method .",
    "the more accurate study of the inspiral phase of compact binaries however reveals other important contributions to be taken into account .",
    "these are the perturbations due to the ( a ) spin - spin ( ss ) interaction [ @xcite ] ; ( b ) the interaction of the magnetic dipole moments for neutron stars with huge magnetic fields ( dd ) [ @xcite ] and ( c ) the contribution arising from the motion of one of the binary components ( treated as a monopole ) in the quadrupolar field of the other ( qm ) [ @xcite ] .",
    "the corresponding secular contributions to the energy and angular momentum losses could be computed [ @xcite ] , [ @xcite ] , and [ @xcite ] by the method presented in [ @xcite ] , in spite of the radial equation being _ different _ from eq .",

    "( for a review of these parametrizations see [ @xcite ] . )",
    "the method of computing secular effects presented in [ @xcite ] relies on novel complex parametrizations of the radial part of the motion and its advantage over previous approaches [ @xcite ] , [ @xcite ] is in its overwhelming simplicity .",
    "other methods can of course be successfully applied , like the use of the laplace second integrals for the legendre polynomials ( [ @xcite ] , [ @xcite ] ) .    in the present work we have generalized both the class of integrands and the class of perturbing forces for which the simple method relying on the use of complex true and eccentric anomaly parametrizations applies .    in a generic perturbed two - body problem , it is easy to see whether a particular secular effect to be computed is of the type ( [ integral ] ) , with @xmath19 periodic , and then to check whether the periodic perturbing functions @xmath15  obey the conditions ( [ condition1 ] ) . then , depending on the power @xmath20 , either theorems 1 or 2 can be applied .",
    "we have also shown explicitly , that for several physically interesting linear perturbations in the conservative dynamics these theorems apply .",
    "whether the so , ss , qm or dd perturbations are of 1pn order or higher , depends on the specific system considered . for comparable mass compact binaries for example",
    "the so contribution is of 1.5pn order , while the ss , qm , dd contributions are all of order 2pn .",
    "by contrast , when one of the masses of the compact binary dominates over the other , the ss contribution becomes negligible , however the so - called self - spin contribution of the dominant spin becomes important .",
    "driven by this remark , as an application to the presented method , we have computed the self - spin contribution to the gravitational luninosity .",
