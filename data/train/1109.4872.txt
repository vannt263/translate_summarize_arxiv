    "the past year has seen impressive progress toward an understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking at the lhc and the tevatron . the allowed mass range for its simplest manifestation  the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson  is now limited to 114 - 145 gev @xcite , which is of course indirectly favored by the global precision electroweak fit .",
    "this low mass region is notoriously difficult to probe at the lhc , and may also be vulnerable to non - sm decay modes that can hide the higgs by suppressing conventional decays even in the simplest extensions of the standard model , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "thus , while the absence of sm - type higgs decay signatures over the full mass range could be interpreted as evidence in favor of a nonperturbative mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking , a plausible alternative hypothesis would be that a perturbative higgs scalar is present but with non - sm decay channels that make it hard to identify @xcite . among these scenarios",
    ", higgs decays to dark matter ( dm ) through the so - called higgs portal comprise a distinct and natural possibility .",
    "while first identified many years ago @xcite , it is only recently that both higgs searches @xcite and dark matter direct detection efforts @xcite have reached the level of sensitivity required to make an experimental test of this possibility a reality .",
    "as the lhc approaches the sensitivity level required to directly observe a sm higgs in the low mass range , underground direct detection experiments probing nuclear recoils of weakly - interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter , are also reaching the important threshold of higgs - mediated scattering , @xmath1  @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this coincidence naturally focuses attention on the possible interplay between these two probes of the higgs sector and its interactions .",
    "in particular , the question arises as to whether a putative invisible higgs width may be constrained by the presence or absence of any direct detection signal .",
    "as recently emphasized in the literature for the most economical dm model  a singlet scalar with higgs - mediated interactions @xcite  combining the collider limits on a sm - like higgs with the direct detection constraints indeed leads to significant restrictions on any invisible higgs branching in the low mass @xmath3  gev region @xcite . in the present note",
    "we will examine the generality of this conclusion in a simple but more generic class of higgs - mediated dark matter interactions , finding that it is far from robust .",
    "indeed , we observe that many scenarios for higgs mediation in the dark sector , beyond the minimal singlet scalar , allow for a significant invisible higgs branching while being poorly constrained by the results of direct detection experiments .    in order to focus on invisible",
    "higgs decays , we will consider dark matter ( and scalar mediators ) whose mass is below @xmath4 , i.e. below 50 - 60 gev for the light higgs region . for such relatively light states",
    ", effective field theory dictates that the largest couplings will be through renormalizable operators , and in this case the higgs portal : _ portal = h^h ( a_i s_i + _ ij s_i s_j ) , [ portal ] where @xmath5 is the sm higgs doublet and we allow for at least two real sm - singlet scalar fields @xmath6 .",
    "these scalars , and other components of the hidden sector , could also transform under larger representations of a hidden sector ( gauge ) group or indeed be composite operators , but for simplicity we focus on perturbative singlets as representative of the basic physics involved .",
    "the lightest scalar @xmath7 may be a dark matter candidate itself , or may mediate the interactions of another stable dark matter species in the hidden sector . for the latter case , we enumerate the renormalizable possibilities below for a hidden sector fermion @xmath8 , _ hid = ( m_n+ _ i s_i ) |n n + _ i s |n i_5 n - v(s_i ) .",
    "[ hidden ] the potential term may include multiple scalars , and it is assumed that it satisfies the usual requirements of vacuum stability .",
    "the minimal model contains just one scalar field , and the higgs portal @xmath9 regulates the abundance of @xmath7 as wimp dm .",
    "it also provides a rigid link between the invisible higgs branching ratio and the dm scattering cross section @xcite .",
    "various combinations of the portal and hidden sector couplings @xmath10 will determine the relic density and scattering cross - section of dark matter .",
    "our primary strategy will be to constrain these parameters by requiring that the relic dark matter abundance is regulated by the annihilation at freeze - out either of dm itself or of its mediators , and then to explore the interplay between the existing constraints and future sensitivity in direct detection and the invisible decay width @xmath11 . to assess the importance of this decay channel",
    ", we will characterize the invisible higgs branching with the following figure of merit @xcite , which approximates the dilution of all visible higgs decay modes in the low @xmath12 regime , r_vis & = & + & ~ & . in this expression",
    ", @xmath13 is the electroweak v.e.v . , the yukawa coupling of the @xmath14-quark is normalized at the @xmath12 scale , and the phase space factors are neglected . as the dm mass is taken below @xmath15 gev ,",
    "the invisible higgs decay channel becomes dominant . within background - dominated lhc higgs searches ,",
    "a detection of the higgs boson via its conventional decay modes would then require increasing the size of the higgs dataset by at least a factor of @xmath16 .    in the next section ,",
    "we outline a series of specific model scenarios falling within the general higgs - mediated setting of ( [ portal ] ) and ( [ hidden ] ) , focussing on the link between the invisible higgs width and the direct detection sensitivity .",
    "the higgs portal allows for a number of higgs - mediated dark matter scenarios , where the set of induced @xmath17 couplings determines both the direct scattering cross - section and the invisible higgs width .",
    "below , we detail a series of modules ( or simplified models @xcite ) which encode the basic physics . many of these modules can be embedded as part of more comprehensive uv theories .",
    "the wimp scenario of fermionic dm mediated by the higgs portal has been discussed before ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , focussing on its cp - conserving version ( although see @xcite ) . here",
    "we consider a cp - odd combination of the trilinear higgs portal with a pseudoscalar coupling , = ( h^h ) ( as + s^2 ) + s |n i_5 n , which , on integrating out the heavier scalar @xmath7 and taking the unimportant coupling @xmath18 to be small , leads to _ eff = _ h h|n i_5 n. [ cpodd ] the effective higgs coupling @xmath19 results from @xmath20 mixing induced by the @xmath21 term in the lagrangian , and is taken to satisfy the freeze - out condition , v",

    "1(a ) ) , we observe that the pseudoscalar density @xmath28 vanishes in the nonrelativistic limit , which suppresses the elastic dm - nucleon scattering cross section by an additional factor of @xmath29 , ^eq_p & & ( v / c)^2 ( ) ^2 + & & 10 ^ -48  cm^2_h^2 .",
    "note that ( distinct from @xmath30 ) this is an _ equivalent _ dm - nucleon scattering cross section derived from the dm - nucleus cross section with @xmath31 nucleons .",
    "one observes that not only is this cross section well below the current level of direct detection sensitivity , but it may be below the potentially irreducible background due to the solar neutrino recoil signal @xcite .    at this point , we should try to address the question of how natural it is to have a dominant cp - odd coupling for dm , given the fact that cp violation is small ( or flavor - suppressed ) in the observable sector of the sm .",
    "unfortunately this question does not have a clear - cut answer in the model ( [ cpodd ] ) due to the super - renormalizable nature of the portal @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath7 is a pseudoscalar in the dark sector , the @xmath32 coupling conserves all discrete symmetries . with @xmath31 the cp - violating coupling , even a value @xmath33 may be ` small ' in the sense that @xmath34 given that the uv cutoff of this theory is unknown . changing the cp charge assignment by taking @xmath7 to be a scalar",
    ", we see that the source of cp - violation , now shifted to @xmath35 , is also well sequestered from any visible sector observables due to the need for higgs mediation .",
    "thus a fermionic wimp interacting via this pseudoscalar higgs portal is a viable possibility , and naturally leads to a large invisible higgs width , @xmath36 , while having suppressed signatures for direct detection .",
    "we note in passing that were such a scenario realized , there would be an observable indirect signature through dm annihilation within overdense regions in the galactic halo @xcite ( see _ e.g. _",

    ".,width=264 ]      multi - component wimps with a small splitting between the states have been examined in some detail in recent years , primarily in connection with inelastic dm models @xcite .",
    "here we consider two real scalar wimps coupled through the higgs portal , = _ i , j = 1,2s_i(_ij ( h^h ) -12m^2_ij)s_j , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the 2@xmath392 real symmetric matrices .",
    "dm stability requires a suitable dark symmetry , which forbids the @xmath31 term couplings .",
    "a @xmath40 acting as @xmath41 is one minimal option , among many alternatives .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking and without the loss of generality we can choose the mass terms to be diagonal and write the effective higgs - dm lagrangian as _ eff & = & -12(m_1 ^ 2s_1 ^ 2 + m_2 ^",
    "2s_2 ^ 2 ) + & & + h(_11s_1 ^ 2 + 2 _ 12s_1s_2 + _ 22s_2 ^ 2 ) , where we also assume @xmath42 .",
    "in the present note , we will not attempt to analyze the full parameter space for @xmath43 and @xmath44 . instead",
    ", we will concentrate on the case where the mass splitting is relatively small , m = m_2 - m_10.1 m_1 , [ hier1 ] and the couplings exhibit the hierarchical pattern , _ 22_12 , _ 11 .",
    "[ hier2 ] choosing this pattern of couplings , which we will justify below , ensures that the model has the following properties :    * @xmath45 is a stable dm candidate , while @xmath46 is unstable , @xmath47 . * the cosmological abundance of @xmath45 is controlled via coannihilation : @xmath48 followed by @xmath49 .",
    "* the elastic scattering cross section of @xmath45 on nucleons is suppressed relative to the minimal model by @xmath50 ( or loop suppressed if @xmath51 is sufficiently small @xcite , as exhibited in fig .",
    "if the mass splitting @xmath52 is in the kev range or below , an inelastic component to scattering is also present but suppressed by @xmath53 . * for dm masses below roughly 40 gev , the higgs decay is totally dominated by @xmath54 . depending on the size of @xmath55 , the subsequent decay @xmath56 may or may not happen within the detector volume , resulting in either a ` buried ' or an invisible higgs decay signature .",
    "we can estimate the the size of the off - diagonal coupling @xmath55 needed to ensure that @xmath45 and @xmath46 stay chemically coupled at freeze - out by comparing the rate of higgs - induced @xmath57 conversion , @xmath58 , with the hubble rate at @xmath59 . estimating the scattering of @xmath60 gev @xmath7-particles on charm quarks at @xmath61 gev",
    ", we arrive at the condition _ 12 ^ 2 10 ^ -6 .",
    "[ coan ]    we now address the naturalness of the hierarchy ( [ hier1],[hier2 ] ) .",
    "a simple scenario which achieves it assumes that initially the matrix @xmath37 is dominated by one entry , @xmath62 , and the mass matrix is also nearly diagonal with a small off - diagonal entry , @xmath63 . in this case , the mixing angle required to go to the mass eigenstate basis is small , @xmath64 , and the induced @xmath65 and @xmath66 couplings are suppressed : @xmath67 ; @xmath68 .",
    "the small size of @xmath69 relative to @xmath70 can arise naturally if there are separate approximate discrete symmetries for @xmath45 and @xmath46 broken by this term .",
    "we conclude that this scenario is viable , and does not require an excessive tuning of parameters . in view of the coannihilation requirement ( [ coan ] ) , @xmath71 can be as small as @xmath72 , in which case the direct detection cross sections are suppressed by a factor of @xmath73 .",
    "the secluded regime @xcite makes use of the lagrangian = h^h ( as + s^2 ) + s |n n , and requires that @xmath74 , so that annihilation proceeds via @xmath75 , with @xmath7 decaying on - shell to the sm . requiring @xmath8 to be a thermal wimp leads to the usual restriction that @xmath76 is fixed to be @xmath77 .",
    "the higgs can decay directly to the mediators @xmath78 , with a width controlled by the coupling @xmath18 which does not affect the abundance of @xmath8 .",
    "taking @xmath18 above @xmath79 ensures @xmath80 , so that the higgs width to @xmath81 can be sizeable .",
    "as in the split wimp scenario , this decay will be invisible if @xmath7 is sufficiently long - lived to escape the detector , while it will be ` buried ' if @xmath7 decays occur inside the detector , leading to multiple jets in the final state .",
    "the wimp - nucleon scattering cross section can be made almost arbitrarily small @xcite , and in practice taking @xmath82 renders the scattering rate below the neutrino background for direct detection . on the other hand , this model does have indirect dm detection signatures , which can be enhanced in the case of nonrelativistic annihilation provided that @xmath83 is light @xcite .",
    "a particularly ` signature - poor ' variant of the scenarios considered here comprises a neutral particle @xmath8 sufficiently weakly coupled to the observable sector that throughout the thermal history of the universe it remains sparsely populated compared to other species , i.e. a super - wimp ( see _ e.g _ @xcite ) .",
    "the lagrangian can be taken in a form that closely resembles the minimal scalar dm model , = ( h^h ) s^2 + s |n n - v(s ) , where the mediator @xmath7 is relatively heavy , @xmath84 .",
    "the thermal history consists of the normal annihilation of @xmath7 at the freeze - out , followed by the late decay @xmath85 producing the relic dark matter population . assuming that the coupling constant @xmath86 satisfies the criterion , ^2 10 ^ -24 , the direct thermal production of @xmath8 states ( e.g. via @xmath87 ) is subdominant to @xmath7 decays and @xmath8 is a super - wimp .",
    "the coupling @xmath18 required to ensure the appropriate relic abundance of @xmath7 ( and thus @xmath8 ) can then be obtained from the corresponding coupling in the minimal scalar model by the following rescaling , = _ min .",
    "the only signature of this model is the enhanced @xmath88 decay that can easily dominate over the sm channels if @xmath89 is not too small . unlike other super - wimp models ( e.g. nlsp - to - gravitino decays )",
    ", the decay of @xmath90 occurs completely within the dark sector and does not have additional bbn / cmb - related signatures @xcite .",
    "appropriately mixed @xmath91 neutralino lsp candidates in the mssm are archetypal examples of wimps which can undergo higgs - mediated elastic scattering at the current direct - detection threshold ( see e.g. @xcite for an analysis in the low mass range ) . however",
    ", this example does not fit within the scenarios outlined above , primarily because it relies on @xmath92 being large , which enhances dm annihilation mediated by the pseudoscalar higgs @xmath31 , and neutralino - nucleon scattering mediated by @xmath5 exchange .",
    "the invisible width of the lightest higgs boson @xmath93 decaying to neutralinos is suppressed by @xmath94 due to the small mixing of @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "models with light neutralino dm also typically have a number of charged states ( higgses @xmath97 , sfermions etc . ) near the weak scale , which allows for discovery via channels unrelated to dm .",
    "however , turning to nmssm scenarios , the chances for invisible or hidden higgs decays are substantially higher @xcite .    here",
    "we extend the mssm particle content by singlet chiral superfields @xmath8 and @xmath7 , in close analogy with eqs .",
    "( [ portal ] ) and ( [ hidden ] ) , while requiring all superpartners of the sm fields to be heavy .",
    "an example of this nmssm - type extension , with a supersymmetric higgs portal , is given by the superpotential , w = _ s h_1h_2 s + m_ss^2 + ( m + s)n^2 .",
    "if , in addition to sm superpartners , @xmath5 , @xmath31 and @xmath97 are heavy and @xmath98 , this model reduces to the sm ( with @xmath99 being the sm - like higgs doublet ) plus the susy multiplets of @xmath7 and @xmath8 . by varying the couplings , one can find regimes reproducing most of the sm higgs portal models discussed above .",
    "the scalar potential contains the terms @xmath100 , from which we can identify the couplings to the complex scalar @xmath7 in ( [ portal ] ) as @xmath101 and @xmath102 . choosing these couplings appropriately",
    ", we reproduce the super - wimp and secluded wimp models with states from the @xmath8 multiplet playing the role of dm .",
    "the pseudoscalar higgs portal can be constructed by taking @xmath103 real and choosing arg@xmath104 . in this case , only im@xmath105 couples the fermionic dm candidate @xmath8 to the higgs portal via the @xmath106 bilinear , while re@xmath105 will not couple to the higgs portal at all .",
    "finally , split wimps can be obtained by introducing multiple @xmath107 states with small mass splittings , while allowing just one to have a large coupling to the @xmath7 mediator field . in all these models ,",
    "the lightest susy higgs state @xmath93 can have a significant ( or dominant ) invisible branching fraction directly to dm states and/or its mediators , while the direct detection cross sections are suppressed .",
    "the simplicity of the varied higgs portal scenarios considered above serves to underscore the point that generic models of higgs - mediated dark matter  beyond the minimal model of scalar dm  do not imply a rigid link between the invisible higgs decay width and the dm direct detection signal .",
    "thus the absence of a signal in direct detection need not preclude a sizeable invisible higgs width even if dark matter is predominantly higgs - mediated .",
    "this emphasizes the important role that invisible higgs searches could play in the eventuality that conventional higgs signatures are found to be suppressed and/or excluded at the level of sm cross sections and decay rates .",
    "finally we note that scenarios with a large invisible higgs branching may have interesting cosmological implications , ranging from changes to the thermal history of the sm and dark sectors ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , to modifications of the electroweak phase transition @xcite which may impact scenarios for electroweak baryogenesis .",
