    "precision tracking of the pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft over more than 30 years has revealed an anomalous frequency drift of the doppler radar signals transmitted by the spacecraft  @xcite .",
    "after careful analysis of potential sources of this frequency drift , it has been concluded that it most likely is caused by an anomalous acceleration of both spacecraft , directed towards the sun .",
    "moreover , the anomalous acceleration seems to stay constant over long distances , and it has been estimated to have very similar values for both spacecraft , about @xmath0over distances between 20 and 70 au from the sun @xcite . the data presented by anderson et .",
    "@xcite show that the anomalous acceleration became noticable beyond the orbit of saturn , i.e. around 10 au .",
    "it quickly grew to a near constant value of around @xmath1 directed towards the sun , and has remained more or less constant beyond 20 au .",
    "as the pioneer anomaly remains unaccounted for , the question has been raised whether the anomaly could originate from unknown physics .",
    "indeed , a number of proposals for possible physical explanations have been made .",
    "these range from conventional physics , such as anisotropic heat dissipation @xcite , drag from interplanetary dust @xcite or gravitational attraction from kuiper - belt objects @xcite , to  new physics , such as scalar fields@xcite , brane - world scenarios @xcite , dark matter , modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite , modifications to the newtonian gravitational potential @xcite , modifications to general relativity @xcite , and other alternative gravitational theories , see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether the effect could have a gravitational origin , either originating from an unknown gravitational source present within the solar system , or being a manifestation of long - range modifications to gravity , i.e. arising from  deviations in the vacuum gravitational field from the field predicted by general relativity , where these deviations become observable only over longer distances .",
    "if the latter were found to be true , it would imply the need for a revision of established gravitational theory , a possibility that , however remote it might be , by itself explains the attention the pioneer anomaly has received within the fundamental physics community . if the pioneer anomaly were indeed a gravitational effect , one  would , according to the equivalence principle , expect such a disturbance in the gravitational field to also affect the motions of the planets . the question of whether the pioneer anomaly could be attributed to a gravitational source in the solar system was considered by anderson et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "the orbits of the inner planets are determined with very high precision , and no anomalous motion of these planets have been observed , so if a gravitational source were to explain the pioneer anomaly , it could not be present in the inner solar system .  however ,",
    "because the pioneer effect first became visible as the spacecraft entered the outer solar system , their analysis does not exclude the possibility of a gravitational source localized to the outer regions of the solar system , beyond the orbit of saturn . in this case",
    ", one  would expect the disturbance in the gravitational field created by such a source to only affect the motions of the three outer planets , which orbit the sun at distances between 20 and 40 au , but it would have no observable effect on the motions of the inner planets . since the orbits of the three outer planets have been determined by optical methods alone  @xcite ,",
    "the uncertainty in their orbital parameters is much higher than for the other planets .",
    "recently , page , dixon and wallin @xcite , izzo and rathke  @xcite and  iorio and giudice @xcite examined the question whether the pioneer anomaly , given that it is a gravitational effect , could have an observable effect on the orbits of the outer planets .",
    "al . concluded that , if the pioneer anomaly has gravitational origin , it would not have an observable effect on the motions of the outer planets , given the present accuracy of planetary data for these planets .",
    "their conclusion was based on the fact that  only optical observations have been made of uranus , neptune and pluto @xcite  and that the a priori uncertainty of the optical measurements for the three outer planets is substantial , resulting in rather large uncertainties in their orbital parameters .",
    "such uncertainties could possibly mask the disturbances to the planetary orbits caused by an anomalous gravitational field .",
    "however , no calculations were shown to substantiate their conclusion .",
    "izzo and rathke , on the other hand , came to a different conclusion .",
    "they concluded that the pioneer anomaly could not have gravitational origin , because it would be in conflict with the ephemerides of uranus and neptune .",
    "they used parametric constraints set on a parametrization of deviations from newtonian gravity in terms of an effective reduced solar mass @xmath2 @xcite . applying the constraints to the planets uranus and neptune",
    ", they concluded that the deviations to the newtonian gravitational potential implied by the pioneer anomaly would lead to  changes in the effective reduced solar mass that exceeded the limits set by solar system measurements by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "iorio and giudice @xcite came to the same conclusion , providing an assessment of the  perturbations to the orbits of the outer planets based on the gauss equations .",
    "the gauss equations estimate the effect of a perturbation in the gravitational field in terms of the time rate of change it causes on the osculating orbital elements . iorio and giudice found large secular effects on the argument of the perihelion and",
    "mean anomaly for all three outer planets .",
    "the possibility that the pioneer anomaly might indicate a deviation in the vacuum gravitational potential from the one predicted by general relativity has also been studied .",
    "a possible yukawa modification to the newtonian gravitational potential has been dismissed because of constraints from planetary data @xcite . however",
    ", modified gravitational theories have been proposed that are claimed to account for the pioneer anomaly without violating parametric constraints inferred from planetary data @xcite .      as we can see from this brief review of the subject ( which by no means is complete , for a more complete review see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the number of models that have been proposed to explain the pioneer anomaly is already significant , and growing fast . fitting a model to parametric constraints is useful for dismissal and initial scrutiny of models , but a closer examination of the models that pass the parametric constraints is in place . when looking at the models aiming to explain the pioneer anomaly , they are different , but many of them are based on the assumption that the motion of the pioneer spacecraft is geodesic .",
    "the question whether the pioneer effect could have gravitational origin , either being caused by an unknown gravitational source localized in the outer regions of the solar system or arising from  long - range deviations in the gravitational field from the vacuum field predicted by general relativity , can be reformulated as a question of whether the pioneer spacecraft move geodesically . within the class of metric theories of gravity , this question is model independent . as will be seen , it can be satisfactorily answered by giving quantitative , model - independent estimates derived from the basic equations of motions , of the perturbations to the orbits of the outer planets that would result from such an effect .",
    "these estimates could then be compared with observations , thus providing a more thorough test of models against observations . to settle this question",
    "would be of significance for the substantial model building effort targeting the pioneer anomaly .",
    "furthermore , if it were possible to prove that the pioneer spacecraft moved non - geodesically , it would imply that we could rule out a large class of models , including several of the models that have been proposed to explain the pioneer anomaly .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to derive an answer to the question posed above ; whether the pioneers move geodesically .",
    "we will perform a quantitative , model - independent assessment of the perturbations to the motions of the outer planets that would arise from a disturbance to the spacetime metric of the kind required to account for the pioneer anomaly .",
    "the rationale for analyzing the motions of the outer planets is , in addition to the obvious reason that they orbit the sun at distances at which the pioneer anomaly has been observed , the relatively large uncertainty in their orbital parameters @xcite .",
    "therefore , the likelihood of our result will to a large extent depend on this uncertainty .",
    "the procedures that are currently applied for calculating the ephemerides of the planets use available theory , taking into account known gravitational sources , and carefully fitting the computed orbits to available observational data @xcite .",
    "one would therefore expect that any disturbance to the gravitational field within the solar system would , if large enough , over time generate residuals in the position measurements of the planets as they would tend to drift from their expected positions .",
    "the question then is , what residuals would arise if we were to explain the pioneer anomaly as the result of a perturbation to the gravitational field in the outer solar system , and how do they compare with the observed residuals ?",
    "whether or not this metric perturbation is induced by a real gravitational source or is just a manifestation of a long - range deviation in the vacuum gravitational field from the field predicted by general relativity is irrelevent for our study . in order to determine whether a perturbation to the gravitational field has an observable effect on planetary orbits , we will have to simulate the effect that the gravitational perturbation would have on the planetary orbits ( what we will refer to as the _ gross perturbations _ or _ gross effects _ ) , then compute the simulated ephemeris as the solution to the unperturbed equations of motion that provides the best fit to the perturbed solution , compute the simulated residual as the difference between those two solutions and finally compare the simulated residuals with the real residuals .",
    "an assessment similar to our study was recently done by iorio and giudice @xcite , based on the gauss equations for orbital motion .",
    "the gauss equations estimate rates of change of orbital elements , an approach that makes the effects easy to understand . on the other hand ,",
    "the  orbital elements are not directly observable , and the estimation of observables from them is not straight forward . in their work , they investigated the gross orbit perturbations caused by a constant , anomalous acceleration of the pioneer kind .",
    "they found large secular effects on the argument of the perihelion and mean anomaly for all three outer planets .",
    "as will be shown later , such large secular effects will largely be canceled by the ephemeris , because secular effects are lowest - order effects that to a large extent will be matched by a best fit solution to the unperturbed equations of motion .",
    "our approach is to work from the basic equations of motion , thus working with the real orbit of the body , not with approximate orbital elements .",
    "relating our results to measurements is only a matter of making coordinate transformations between the reference frame of the calculation and the reference frame of the observer .",
    "we apply the hypothesis that the pioneer spacecraft move geodesically through space , i.e. that the only forces acting on them are gravitational and that the anomalous acceleration is the effect of disturbances to the spacetime metric .",
    "furthermore , we assume a spherically symmetric gravitational field that can be described within the framework of  a metric theory of gravitation .",
    "the spacecraft move approximately in opposite directions and their trajectories have both minor inclinations relative to the ecliptic plane @xcite , so a spherically symmetric gravitational field at large  distances from the sun should be a reasonable assumption . since we are assuming a metric theory of gravitation , the equivalence principle will be valid within the theory @xcite . at the outset , we assume nothing about how the metric couples to gravitational sources or of the nature of any gravitational source , so our results will be model independent in the sense that they will only depend on the assumptions of geodesic motion in a static spacetime metric and spherical symmetry .",
    "we will work in the weak field limit , and in this limit , a metric theory of gravitation can be parametrized using the ppn formalism @xcite .",
    "thus , our results will be valid for any ppn - parametrizable gravitational theory .",
    "we are only interested in dominant effects and will work perturbatively to lowest order in the non - relativistic weak field limit .",
    "to lowest order , independent perturbations decouple , so we may disregard other effects that perturb the planetary orbits , like disturbances from other planets or satellites .",
    "this simplification allows us to treat the problem analytically by doing perturbative expansions around idealized  analytical solutions to the planetary orbits .      in section [ xref - section-4264724 ]",
    "we derive and solve the perturbative equations of motion for newtonian gravity .",
    "we make a quantitative assessment of the gross perturbations in order to get a better understanding of the real effects of the gravitational perturbation . in this section",
    "we also account for the accuracy of the perturbative expansions applied .",
    "then , in section [ xref - section-415172115 ] , we make the generalization of this procedure to any metric theory of gravitation .",
    "first , we derive the unique form that the perturbation to the gravitational field must have in order to be able to account for the pioneer anomaly . from the equations of motion , it is possible to uniquely derive the signature of the gravitational potential that would cause a constant anomalous acceleration .",
    "having uniquely constrained the spacetime metric , we are able to derive the perturbative equations for geodesic motion and find the general solution to them .    in section [ xref - section-4264518 ] ,",
    "we cover in detail the analysis method that will be employed in order to determine whether the perturbations computed in sections [ xref - section-4264724 ] and  [ xref - section-415172115 ] are observable or not .",
    "finally , in section [ xref - section-426554 ] , we apply this analysis method to the results of sections [ xref - section-4264724 ] and [ xref - section-415172115 ] . here , we first derive the simulated ephemeris , which is the solution to the unperturbed equations of motion that best fits the perturbed solution .",
    "having obtained the simulated ephemeris , we then compute the simulated residuals as the difference between the observable values of the  perturbed orbit and the simulated ephemeris .",
    "finally , we are able to conduct the result analysis described in section [ xref - section-4264518 ] , where we compare the simulated residuals with the real residuals .",
    "we will start our analysis with the simplest case , which is that of a static , spherically symmetric , newtonian gravitational field .      for an object moving freely in a static ,",
    "spherically symmetric gravitational field , motion is planar . in order to describe the motion of the object ,",

    "<S> if the pioneer anomaly has a gravitational origin , it would , according to the equivalence principle , distort the motions of the planets in the solar system . since no anomalous motion of the planets has been detected , it is generally believed that the pioneer anomaly can not originate from a gravitational source in the solar system </S>",
    "<S> . however , this conclusion becomes less obvious when considering models that either imply modifications to gravity at long range or gravitational sources localized to the outer solar system , given the uncertainty in the orbital parameters of the outer planets . </S>",
    "<S> following the general assumption that the pioneer spacecraft move geodesically in a spherically symmetric spacetime metric , we derive the metric disturbance that is needed in order to account for the pioneer anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> we then analyze the residual effects on the astronomical observables of the three outer planets that would arise from this metric disturbance , given an arbitrary metric theory of gravity .  providing a method for comparing the computed residuals with actual residuals , </S>",
    "<S> our results imply that the presence of a perturbation to the gravitational field necessary to induce the pioneer anomaly is in conflict with available data for the planets uranus and pluto , but not for neptune . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that the motion of the pioneer spacecraft must be non - geodesic . </S>",
    "<S> since our results are model independent within the class of metric theories of gravity , they can be applied to rule out any model of the pioneer anomaly that implies that the pioneer spacecraft move geodesically in a perturbed spacetime metric , regardless of the origin of this metric disturbance .    </S>",
