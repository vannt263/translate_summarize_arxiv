    "spherical couette flow is the flow induced in a spherical shell by differentially rotating the inner and/or outer spheres .",
    "magnetic spherical couette flow , first considered by @xcite , is the magnetohydrodynamic analog , in which the fluid is taken to be electrically conducting , and a magnetic field is externally imposed .",
    "one motivation for studying this problem is to understand the dynamics of the earth s molten iron outer core , and the magnetic field that is generated within it .",
    "there have also been two experiments on magnetic spherical couette flow , the first in a uniform axial field imposed via helmholtz coils from the outside @xcite , and the second in a dipolar field imposed via a permanent magnet embedded in the inner sphere @xcite .",
    "the question of what type of field to impose is indeed fundamental in determining much of the subsequent dynamics .",
    "even if we insist that this field be axisymmetric about the rotation axis of the inner and/or outer spheres ( otherwise the problem immediately becomes fully three - dimensional ) , one could still impose an axial field from outside , or a dipole ( or quadrupole ) from inside , or indeed any combination of these . and",
    "because of the highly anisotropic nature of the magnetic tension force , coupling the fluid along the magnetic field lines , many of the results can be explained largely by the geometry of the imposed field .",
    "fluid on field lines that thread only the inner or only the outer sphere will co - rotate with that sphere , whereas fluid on field lines linking the two spheres will rotate at some intermediate rate .",
    "the result is a shear layer , a so - called parallel or shercliff layer , on the particular field line separating one type from another @xcite .",
    "the thickness of these layers scales at @xmath1 , where the hartmann number @xmath2 is a measure of the strength of the imposed field .",
    "another issue that turns out to be surprisingly important concerns the nature of the inner and outer boundaries , and whether they are taken to be insulating or conducting .",
    "one obtains a standard shercliff layer only if both spheres are insulating . for a conducting inner sphere , @xcite showed that instead of merely a shear layer , one obtains a super - rotating region , in which fluid rotates slightly faster than either the inner or outer spheres . and finally , if both boundaries are conducting , this super - rotation can be made arbitrarily large , scaling as @xmath3 instead of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these two types of super - rotation were both obtained for dipolar fields . for axial fields ,",
    "one obtains a counter - rotation , which is again either @xmath4 if only one boundary is conducting , or @xmath3 if both are @xcite .    motivated by these surprisingly different results for axial and dipolar fields , @xcite considered linear combinations of the two , and showed that one may have super- and counter - rotating regions simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , because axial and dipolar fields both have the same @xmath5 structure , differing only in @xmath6 , one can adjust the particular linear combination so that the radial component of the field is zero on any desired radial shell .",
    "one can therefore choose the combination such that @xmath0 on the outer sphere , or on the inner , or any radius in between .",
    "one can thereby precisely control the geometry of the imposed field : if @xmath0 on the outer sphere , then all field lines thread only the inner sphere , and vice versa . if @xmath0 at some intermediate radius , then some field lines thread only the inner sphere , and some only the outer . in no case",
    "though will there be any field lines linking the inner and outer spheres . in terms of the results discussed above",
    ", these particular linear combinations are therefore important special cases .    having @xmath0 on either the inner or outer boundary is also an important special case in terms of the structure of the hartmann boundary layers that are generally expected to form there .",
    "it is known @xcite that the standard hartmann layer breaks down at isolated points where @xmath0 , so if @xmath0 everywhere on a particular boundary , the entire structure of the boundary layer there will be altered , becoming essentially a shercliff layer that just happens to coincide with a boundary .",
    "it is for both of these reasons that these particular linear combinations of fields are worthy of special attention .",
    "all of these special geometrical properties discussed so far are in the essentially linear regime , where the inertial term @xmath7 is negligible , because the differential rotation between the two spheres is infinitesimal .",
    "it is obviously of interest then to consider what happens when this term is no longer negligible . at this point",
    "axial and dipolar fields again differ quite dramatically . for axial fields",
    ", the axisymmetric basic state is largely unaffected , and one is interested instead in the onset of non - axisymmetric instabilities @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for dipolar fields , the basic state itself is strongly altered , with these particular field lines distinguishing one region from another becoming much less prominent @xcite .    in this work",
    "then we will essentially combine @xcite and @xcite , taking the imposed fields to be these special linear combinations considered by @xcite , but extending this into the strongly nonlinear regime as in @xcite .",
    "we will find the same general types of boundary layer instabilities as in @xcite , but will also show that having @xmath0 at one boundary or the other , or in between , can still have a significant influence on the solutions .",
    "the equations to be solved are essentially the same as in @xcite , @xmath8 @xmath9 except that @xmath10 will no longer be a purely axial field .    length is scaled by the radius of the inner sphere @xmath11 , time by the viscous diffusive timescale @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the viscosity .",
    "@xmath14 is scaled by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the imposed rotation rate of the inner sphere ( with a stationary outer sphere ) .",
    "the reynolds number @xmath17 is then the non - dimensional measure of @xmath16 .",
    "the hartmann number @xmath18 similarly measures the strength of the imposed field @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are respectively the permeability , density , and magnetic diffusivity .",
    "these equations have been formulated in the limit of infinitesimal magnetic reynolds number @xmath23 , in which the induced magnetic field is given by @xmath24 , but @xmath25 no longer appears in the actual equations to be solved . in this @xmath26",
    "limit the lorentz force @xmath27 in ( 1 ) , and the inductive term @xmath28 in ( 2 ) also become linear .",
    "the only nonlinearity is therefore the inertial term @xmath29 .",
    "the boundary conditions associated with ( 1 ) are @xmath30 where we fix @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the boundary conditions associated with ( 2 ) are somewhat more complicated , and in particular depend on whether the inner and outer regions are taken to be insulators or conductors .",
    "there are then four possible combinations , ii , ci , ic , and cc , where the first letter indicates the inner boundary and the second letter the outer .",
    "we will present only ii and cc results here ; the other two cases do not appear to yield fundamentally new dynamics .",
    "see @xcite for sample calculations of all four , but only in the linear limit @xmath33 .",
    "for the actual mathematical formulation of the ii and cc boundary conditions , we refer to @xcite , where both are derived in detail .",
    "these equations and associated boundary conditions are solved using the code described by @xcite , in which the radial structure is expanded in terms of chebyshev polynomials , and the angular structure in terms of spherical harmonics . in this work",
    "we will consider only axisymmetric solutions , so the code was reduced to a two - dimensional version , with no variation in @xmath34 . in @xmath6 and @xmath5 ,",
    "resolutions as high as @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively were used .",
    "equation ( 1 ) is time - stepped by a second - order runge - kutta method , modified to treat the diffusive term implicitly .",
    "at each time - step of ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) is inverted for @xmath37 .",
    "the imposed field @xmath10 is taken to be a linear combination of dipolar and axial fields , @xmath38 note how @xmath39 and @xmath40 have the same @xmath5 dependence ; by adjusting @xmath41 one can therefore impose @xmath0 on the particular radial surface @xmath42 .",
    "we will consider @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , yielding @xmath0 on the outer boundary , the inner boundary , and at the midpoint @xmath46 . finally ,",
    "once @xmath41 has been specified , the constant @xmath47 is adjusted such that the volume - averaged field strength is unity , @xmath48 .",
    "its dimensional magnitude has after all already been incorporated into the hartmann number .",
    "the field still has considerable spatial variation though , so hartmann numbers for different @xmath41 are not necessarily directly comparable .",
    ", @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the first panel in each row shows the field lines of the corresponding imposed fields @xmath10 ; note in particular how @xmath0 at @xmath49 , 1 , and 1.5 , respectively . the next four panels show contours of the angular velocity @xmath50 , with a contour interval 0.1 , for the four cases ( @xmath51 , ii ) , ( @xmath52 , ii ) , ( @xmath51 , cc ) , ( @xmath52 , cc ) , and all at @xmath53 .",
    "for the cc results , dark - shaded regions are super - rotating ( @xmath54 ) , and light - shaded regions are counter - rotating ( @xmath55 ) . ]",
    "we begin by reviewing the @xmath33 linear regime previously considered by @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows both the imposed fields @xmath10 , as well as the resulting angular velocities .",
    "focusing first on the simpler ii cases , we see that the angular velocity @xmath50 is essentially constant on field lines of @xmath10 , as expected according to ferraro s law of isorotation @xcite . a shercliff layer forms at the radius where @xmath0 .",
    "hartmann layers also form at boundaries where @xmath56 .",
    "the hartmann layers are much thinner than the shercliff layers , scaling as @xmath57 versus @xmath1 .",
    "turning next to the cc cases , we see that there are now regions that are super - rotating , with @xmath54 , as well as counter - rotating , with @xmath58 . with conducting boundaries , electric currents can recirculate through them , leading to increased currents in the fluid , and hence increased lorentz forces , which accelerate the fluid into super- and counter - rotation .",
    "the shercliff layers are in the same locations as in the ii cases , but are considerably thinner than before ( but still scale as @xmath1 ) .",
    "the hartmann layers have been largely eliminated ; the electro - magnetic coupling across a conducting boundary is so strong that such boundary layers can not exist as before .",
    "a few calculations were also done for ci and ic boundary conditions , with the following results : for @xmath43 , ci is similar to cc , and ic is similar to ii , whereas for @xmath59 , ci is similar to ii , and ic is similar to cc .",
    "the classification is evidently determined by the boundary where @xmath56 , that is , by the boundary where a hartmann layer forms for i , but is suppressed for c. in contrast , shercliff layers can form at both i and c boundaries ( because they are not really boundary layers at all , but rather internal shear layers that just happen to coincide with the boundaries for the special cases @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "it is not surprising then that the boundary where @xmath56 is more important in determining the similarities between different cases .    , cc solutions , for @xmath51 , and @xmath60 , 100 , 300 , and 1000 , from left to right .",
    "the top row shows contours of the angular velocity , as in figure 1 .",
    "the bottom row shows streamlines of the meridional circulation @xmath61 , with solid lines denoting counter - clockwise flow , and dashed lines clockwise . from left to right , the maximum values of @xmath61 are @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . ]    , cc solution , for @xmath51 and @xmath66 . from left to right , four snapshots of the time - dependent solution , uniformly spaced throughout the period @xmath67 .",
    "as in figure 2 , the top row shows contours of @xmath50 , the bottom row @xmath61 , with @xmath68 . ]    in the remainder of this paper we wish to consider the influence of increasingly large @xmath69 on these solutions in figure 1 .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath43 , cc results , for @xmath51 and @xmath69 from 30 to 1000 . one new feature that immediately emerges as soon as @xmath70 is a meridional circulation .",
    "this acts back on the angular velocity in a number of ways .",
    "first , because it is outward near the equator , it tends to compress the shercliff layer against the outer boundary , so that by @xmath71 it is much thinner than it was for @xmath53 .",
    "second , we note that by @xmath71 the counter - rotation has been almost completely eliminated , and the super - rotation has also been considerably reduced .    in figure 3 , @xmath69",
    "is further increased to 3000 , which results in a time - dependent solution .",
    "the time - dependence is almost exclusively confined to the shercliff layer though , consisting of a series of ripples within this layer .",
    "it is quite similar to the time - dependent solutions previously obtained in a purely dipolar field @xcite , even though the boundary layer in that case was a true hartmann layer rather than the shercliff layer here . for @xmath70",
    "the distinction between hartmann and shercliff layers is apparently less critical than it is for @xmath53 .    for @xmath51 ,",
    "the onset of this time - dependence is at @xmath72 , and appears to be a subcritical hopf bifurcation .",
    "that is , if one gradually increases @xmath69 until the onset of instabilities , and then decreases it again , there is a certain degree of hysteresis before one switches back to the steady solutions .",
    "these calculations are unfortunately too time - consuming to allow a precise determination of the initial @xmath73 , or the extent of the hysteresis .",
    "if we next increase the hartmann number to @xmath74 , the onset of time - dependence is at @xmath75 ( again with hysteresis ) , perhaps suggesting an @xmath76 scaling .",
    "precisely determining how @xmath73 scales with @xmath2 would obviously be even more time - consuming though than simply determining it at any particular value of @xmath2 .",
    "further increasing @xmath2 to @xmath77 , the solutions are ( not surprisingly ) stable at least up to @xmath78 .",
    "figure 4 shows results for @xmath52 and @xmath69 from 300 to 10000 .",
    "one very interesting result emerges from comparing the two @xmath71 solutions in figures 2 and 4 : the thickness of the shercliff layer now appears to be controlled far more by @xmath69 than by @xmath2 .",
    "there are unfortunately no analytic predictions to compare with in this nonlinear regime .    , cc solutions , for @xmath52 , and @xmath79 , 1000 , 3000 , 10000 , from left to right .",
    "as in figure 2 , the top row shows contours of @xmath50 , the bottom row @xmath61 , with @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 . ]    , ii solution , for @xmath51 and @xmath78 . from left to right , four snapshots of the time - dependent solution , uniformly spaced throughout the period @xmath84 .",
    "as in figure 2 , the top row shows contours of @xmath50 , the bottom row @xmath61 , with @xmath85 . ]",
    "figure 5 shows the result of switching from cc to ii boundary conditions . we still obtain a time - dependence very similar to that in figure 3 , but the onset does not occur until @xmath86 , again with hysteresis .",
    "ii boundaries are therefore considerably more stable than cc .",
    "the reason for this is straightforward : for cc , the hartmann layer on the inner boundary is completely suppressed , so all of the adjustment in angular velocity occurs across the shercliff layer at the outer boundary .",
    "in contrast , for ii , much of the adjustment occurs across the hartmann layer , so the shercliff layer is considerably weaker than for cc . a weaker shercliff layer then requires a much larger reynolds number before it will become unstable .    , cc solutions , from left to right ( @xmath51 , @xmath66 ) , ( @xmath51 , @xmath78 ) , ( @xmath52 , @xmath66 ) , ( @xmath52 , @xmath78 ) .",
    "as in figure 2 , the top row shows contours of @xmath50 , the bottom row @xmath61 , with @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 . ]",
    "we next switch to @xmath59 .",
    "figure 6 shows these solutions , at @xmath51 and @xmath77 , and @xmath66 and 10000 for each .",
    "increasing @xmath2 again increases the super-/counter - rotation , whereas increasing @xmath69 suppresses them . in this case",
    "the inner shercliff layer is very stable though , with no evidence of any transition to time - dependence even up to @xmath91 .",
    "partly this may be due to the spatial variation of @xmath10 ; @xmath92 at the inner boundary for @xmath59 is @xmath93 times stronger than @xmath92 at the outer boundary for @xmath43 .",
    "it seems very unlikely though that a mere 2.2 times increase in field strength ( for a given hartmann number ) could by itself cause such an enormous increase in critical reynolds number , from @xmath94 to over 30000 .",
    "we conclude therefore that an inner shercliff layer is intrinsically more stable than an outer shercliff layer .",
    "the instabilities of the outer shercliff layer are perhaps similar to grtler vortices , which also occur only if a boundary is curved one way , but not the other .",
    "finally , figures 7 and 8 show results for @xmath95 . increasing @xmath69 in this case appears to destroy the shercliff layer completely . for sufficiently large @xmath69",
    "these solutions again become time - dependent , but the instabilities are no longer confined to boundary layers .",
    "one further new feature that emerges for sufficiently large @xmath69 is a super - rotating region near the pole .",
    "this is quite different from the previous super - rotations though , which were all driven by the lorentz force .",
    "in contrast , this super - rotation is induced by the inertial term : as the meridional circulation sweeps fluid inward toward the pole , conservation of angular momentum causes its angular velocity to increase , eventually exceeding one .    , cc solutions , for @xmath51 , and @xmath96 , 300 , 1000 , 3000 , from left to right .",
    "as in figure 2 , the top row shows contours of @xmath50 , the bottom row @xmath61 , with @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 . ]    , cc solution , for @xmath51 and @xmath78 . from left",
    "to right , four snapshots of the time - dependent solution , uniformly spaced throughout the period @xmath101 .",
    "as in figure 2 , the top row shows contours of @xmath50 , the bottom row @xmath61 , with @xmath102 . ]",
    "in this work we have considered magnetic spherical couette flow in three particular field configurations @xmath10 , specifically chosen to place shercliff layers at either the outer boundary , or the inner , or exactly in between . in each case",
    "we then increased the reynolds number , and studied the resulting balance and competition between magnetic and inertial effects .",
    "we found that increasing the hartmann number stabilizes the solutions , whereas increasing the reynolds number tends to de - stabilize them , except for @xmath59 , where we never obtained any instabilities .",
    "it would be of interest to further increase @xmath69 in this case ; some type of instabilities must surely set in eventually , but not necessarily boundary layer instabilities of the type obtained for @xmath43 .",
    "future work should also explore the possibility of non - axisymmetric instabilities , as in the purely axial field case @xcite .    finally , returning to the magnetic spherical couette flow experiments that have previously been done @xcite",
    ", it would be of considerable interest to extend one or the other of these to impose not just purely axial or purely dipolar fields , but some of the configurations presented here .",
