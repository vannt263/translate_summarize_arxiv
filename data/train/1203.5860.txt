    "during the last two decades there has been a great deal of research into lvy type stochastic processes in various systems ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . according to the accepted classification of the lvy type transport phenomena @xcite , lvy flights are markovian random walks characterized by the divergence of the second moment of walker displacement @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath7 ^ 2\\right > \\to \\infty$ ] for any time scale @xmath8 .",
    "it is caused by a power - law asymptotics of the distribution function @xmath9 .",
    "for example , in the one - dimensional case this distribution function exhibits the asymptotic behavior @xmath10^\\alpha / x^{1+\\alpha}$ ] for @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the characteristic length of the walker displacements during the time interval @xmath8 and the exponent @xmath13 belongs to the interval @xmath14 .",
    "the time dependence of the quantity @xmath12 obeys the scaling law @xmath15 .",
    "lvy flights are met , for instance , in the motion of tracer particles in turbulent flows @xcite , the diffusion of particles in random media @xcite , human travel behavior and spreading of epidemics @xcite , or economic time series in finance @xcite .    as far as the developed techniques of modeling such stochastic processes are concerned , worthy of mention are , in particular , the langevin equation with lvy noise ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the corresponding fokker - planck equations @xcite , the description of anomalous diffusion with power - law distributions of spatial and temporal steps @xcite , lvy flights in heterogeneous media @xcite and in external fields @xcite , constructing the fokker - planck equation for lvy type processes in nonhomogeneous media  @xcite , first passage time analysis and escaping problem for lvy flights @xcite .",
    "one of the widely used approaches to coping with lvy flights , especially in complex environment , is the so - called continuous time random walks ( ctrw ) @xcite .",
    "it models , in particular , a general class of lvy type stochastic processes described by the fractional fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "its pivot point is the representation of a stochastic process at hand as a collection of random jumps ( steps ) @xmath16 of a wandering particle in space and time as well . in the frameworks of the coupled ctrw the particle",
    "is assumed to move uniformly along a straight line connecting the initial and terminal points of one step . in this case",
    "the discrete collection of steps is converted into a continuous trajectory and the velocity @xmath17 of motion within one step is introduced . as a result , the given stochastic process is described by the probabilistic properties , e.g. , of the collection of random variables @xmath18 .",
    "a more detailed description of particle motion lies beyond the ctrw model .",
    "unfortunately , for lvy flights fine details of the particle motion within one step can be important especially in heterogeneous media or systems with boundaries because of the divergence of the moment @xmath19 ^ 2\\right>$ ] .",
    "broadly speaking , it is due to a lvy particle being able to jump over a long distance during a short time .",
    "the fact that lvy flights can exhibit nontrivial properties on scales of one step was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite studied the first passage time problem for lvy flights based on the leapover statistics .",
    "previously a new approach to tackling this problem was proposed @xcite .",
    "it is based on the following nonlinear stochastic differential equation with white noise @xmath20 @xmath21 governing random motion of a particle wandering , e.g. , in the one - dimensional space @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the particle velocity , the time scale @xmath23 characterizes the delay in variations of the particle velocity which is caused by the particle inertia , @xmath24 is a dimensionless friction coefficient .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 quantifies the relative contribution of the additive component @xmath26 of the langevin force with respect to the multiplicative one @xmath27 which are combined within one term @xmath28 here we have not specified the type of the stochastic differential equation because in the given case all the types are interrelated via the renormalization of the friction coefficient @xmath24 .",
    "it should be noted that models similar to eq .   within replacement",
    "can be classified as the generalized cauchy stochastic process @xcite and has been employed to study stochastic behavior of various nonequilibrium systems , in particular , lasers @xcite , on - off intermittency @xcite , economic activity @xcite , passive scalar field advected by fluid @xcite , etc .",
    "model   generates continuous markovian trajectories obeying the lvy statistics on time scales @xmath29 @xcite . using a special singular perturbation technique @xcite it was rigorously proved for the superdiffusive regime matching @xmath30 @xcite and also verified numerically for the quasiballistic ( @xmath31 ) and superballistic ( @xmath32 ) regimes @xcite .",
    "moreover , the main expressions obtained for the distribution function @xmath9 and the scaling law @xmath12 within the interval @xmath33 turn out to hold also for the whole region @xmath34 @xcite . after its generalization @xcite model   generates truncated lvy flights as well .    the given approach can be regarded as a continuous markovian realization of lvy flights . indeed , it is possible to choose the system parameters in such a way that , on one hand , the `` microscopic '' time scale @xmath23 be equal to an arbitrary small value given beforehand and , on the other hand , the system behavior remain unchanged on scales @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to elucidate the fundamental features of this approach , to explain the found validity of model   for describing lvy flights of all the regimes , and to construct a certain generalization of the continuous time random walks that admits a rather fine representation of the particle motion within one step .",
    "the latter feature will demonstrate us a way to overcome the basic drawback of the ctrw model , it appeals to different mechanisms in modeling the particle motion within individual steps and the relative orientation of neighboring steps .",
    "following @xcite let us consider random walks @xmath35 of an inertial particle wandering in the one - dimensional space @xmath22 whose velocity @xmath2 is governed by the following stochastic differential equation written in the dimensionless form @xmath36 here the constant @xmath13 is a system parameter meeting the inequality @xmath37 the positive function @xmath38 allows for nonlinear friction effects , @xmath20 is the white gaussian noise with the correlation function @xmath39 and whose intensity @xmath40 depending on the magnitude the particle velocity describes the cumulative effect of the additive and multiplicative components of the langevin random force as noted in introduction . the coefficient @xmath41 has been introduced for the sake of convenience .",
    "the units of the spatial and temporal scales have been chosen in such a manner that the equalities @xmath42 hold .",
    "equation   is written in the stratonovich form , which is indicated with the multiplication symbol @xmath43 in the product of the white noise @xmath20 and its intensity @xmath44 . to avoid possible misunderstanding",
    "we note that this equation has been written in the hnggi - klimontovich form in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the kinetic theory of gases",
    "quantities relative to @xmath45 and @xmath44 and describing regular and random effects caused by the scattering of atoms or molecules are usually called `` kinetic '' coefficients ( see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite ) . for this reason the functions @xmath45 and @xmath44 together with other quantities to be derived from them will be also referred to as the kinetic coefficients .    in the present paper the main attention",
    "is focused on the special case when the kinetic coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath44 are of the form @xmath46 and the random walks @xmath35 generated by model   can be classified as lvy flights for large time scales , i.e. , for @xmath47 in the chosen units @xcite . however , where appropriate , the general form of these kinetic coefficients will be used to demonstrate a certain universality of the results to be obtained and the feasibility of their generalization , for example , to the truncated lvy flights @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in further mathematical manipulations leading to particular results the following assumption about the behavior of the kinetic coefficients @xmath48 will be accepted beforehand .",
    "here @xmath49 is some positive constant and @xmath50 is a certain critical velocity characterizing the region where the generated random walks deviate from lvy flights in properties .",

    "let us pass from the velocity @xmath5 to a new variable @xmath57 introduced via the equation @xmath58 equation   is of the stratonovich form , thus , we may use the standard rules of change of variables in operating with it",
    ". therefore relation   between the variables @xmath5 and @xmath59 enables us to reduce eq .",
    "to the following one @xmath60 where the function @xmath61 is specified by the expression @xmath62 the function @xmath61 together with the parameter @xmath13 determine the rate of the particle regular drift in the @xmath59-space , @xmath63 .",
    "in particular , in case   we have @xmath64 it should be noted that the multiplication symbol @xmath43 has been omitted in eq .",
    "because the noise @xmath20 enters it additively and , thus , all the types of this stochastic differential equation have the same form ( for details see , e.g. , ref .",

    "leaving expression   aside for a moment and keeping in mind solely the governing equations   and we may state that the constructed stochastic process @xmath67 and the random variations @xmath69 of the particle velocity are related to each other via the white noise @xmath20 and are of the same level of generality . only relation   treated as the definition of the function @xmath57 causes us to regard the time variations @xmath67 as a stochastic process derived from @xmath69 .",
    "however , expression   may be read in the `` opposite way '' as the definition of the function @xmath70 . in this case",
    "the process @xmath67 plays the role of the noise source endowing the particle motion with stochastic properties and the particle velocity @xmath71 becomes a derivative random variable .",

    "it should be noted that the situation would be much more complex if we dealt with nonlinear integrals of white noise because the correlation function of white noise proportional to @xmath76 comes up at the boundary of integration regions @xcite .    as in the previous section",

    "it should be noted that exps .   and , as it must ,",
    "coincide with each other within the cofactor @xmath82 ( see exp .  ) coming from the transformation of the elementary volume in the transition @xmath83 .       generated by model   in the frameworks of ansatz  .",
    "the two frames depict the same time pattern for different time scales .",
    "based on the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the value @xmath84 was used . ]    as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is extreme fluctuations in the particle velocity , i.e. , large amplitude peaks in the time pattern @xmath69 that are responsible for the random walks at hand exhibiting the properties of lvy flights .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] illustrates the multiscale structure of the pattern @xmath69 .",
    "it turns out that for any time interval @xmath47 only a few peaks with the largest amplitudes inside it contribute mainly to the particle displacement @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes of such velocity fluctuations are distributed according to the power - law and their characteristic magnitude grows with the observation time interval @xmath8 also according to the power - low .",
    "the former feature gives rise to the lvy distribution of the particle displacement , the latter one is responsible for the lvy time scaling @xcite .",
    "these peculiarities make it attractive to employ the following classification of particle trajectories .",
    "the general idea is to partition any random trajectory @xmath35 in such a manner that its fragments @xmath85 or , more strictly , their `` projections '' @xmath86 onto the velocity space @xmath87 can be treated as random walks _",
    "inside _ or _ outside _ a certain neighborhood @xmath3 of the origin @xmath4 . in this case",
    "it would be possible to regard the fragments of random walks outside the region @xmath3 as individual peaks of the time pattern @xmath69 .",
    "naturally , instead of the space @xmath87 the space @xmath63 of the variable @xmath59 can be equivalently used , so in what follows the corresponding neighborhood in the space @xmath63 will be designated with the same symbol @xmath3 to simplify notations .",
    "besides , to operate with the desired partition efficiently it has to be countable .    a direct implementation of this idea , however , faces a serious obstacle .",
    "the matter is that a random trajectory is not a smooth curve .",
    "therefore , although for a wandering particle it is possible to calculate the probability of getting the boundary of @xmath3 for the first time , the question about crossing this boundary for the second time is meaningless .",
    "the particle will cross the boundary immediately after the first one and ordering such intersection points in the countable manner seems to be just impossible .",
    "the trajectory classification to be constructed below enables us to overcome this problem and , thus , to implement the desired partition .",
    "previously the key elements of this classification were used in describing grain boundary diffusion @xcite and subdiffusion along a comb structure @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] demonstrates the required classification of the particle random walks @xmath67 in the diagram form .",
    "let us describe it step by step .",
    "( ) first of all , just to simplify subsequent mathematical manipulations we confine our consideration to the upper half - space @xmath88 assuming its boundary , @xmath89 , to be reflecting .",
    "the symmetry of the kinetic coefficient @xmath61 , namely , @xmath90 , allows it . then",
    "two values @xmath91 and @xmath92 such that @xmath93 have to be introduced .",
    "the choice of their specific magnitudes will be reasoned below . here",
    ", leaping ahead , we note that in the frameworks of ansatz   the value @xmath91 should not be a too large number enabling us , nevertheless , to approximate the kinetic coefficient @xmath94 by the sign - function for @xmath95 , @xmath96 for example , for @xmath97 the estimates of @xmath98 and @xmath99 hold by virtue of .",
    "the value @xmath92 just should not exceed @xmath91 substantially .",
    "so in some sense @xmath100 is the optimal choice .",
    "certainly , the final results describing the particle displacement in the real space @xmath22 do not depend on the two values .",
    "( ) again to simplify mathematical constructions without loss of generality let us consider trajectories @xmath101 originating from the point @xmath92 , i.e. , set @xmath102 .",
    "their terminal point @xmath103 can take an arbitrary value .",
    "( ) now we are able to specify the desired partition .",
    "each trajectory @xmath101 is represented as a certain collection of fragments shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , which is written symbolically as @xmath104 if there is only one fragment in the collection @xmath105 , namely , the last fragment , then the number @xmath106 of the internal fragments is set equal to zero , @xmath107 .",
    "the meaning of these fragments is as follows .    * the first fragment @xmath108 represents the motion of the particle outside the interval @xmath109 until it gets the point @xmath91 for the first time at a time moment @xmath110 .",
    "further such particle motion will be referred to as random walks _",
    "outside _ the neighborhood @xmath3 of the origin @xmath111 . * the next fragment @xmath112 matches the particle wandering inside the interval @xmath113 until it gets the point @xmath92 for the first time at a certain moment @xmath114 .",
    "particle motion of this type will be referred to as random walks _ inside _ the neighborhood @xmath3 . *",
    "the following two fragments @xmath115 and @xmath116 are similar to the first and second ones , @xmath108 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "the time moments corresponding to their terminal points are designated as @xmath117 and @xmath118 . a sequence of such fragments alternating one another makes up the internal part of the given trajectory . *",

    "this configuration exists only for @xmath124 and is characterized by an even number of the intermediate points , @xmath125 , of the trajectory partition . * * the latter one , @xmath120 , is similar to the former configuration within the exchange of the start and boundary points ; now @xmath91 is the start point whereas @xmath92 is the boundary point of the interval @xmath126 . for the configuration @xmath120 to exist the terminal point",
    "@xmath59 has to meet the inequality @xmath127 .",
    "the corresponding number of the partition points is odd , @xmath128 .",
    "+ it should be noted that when the terminal point @xmath59 of the given trajectory belongs to the interval @xmath129 both the configurations exist . * in addition , for @xmath130 there is a special configuration @xmath131 of the trajectories that start from the point @xmath92 at the initial time @xmath132 and get the point @xmath59 at time @xmath8 without touching the boundary point of @xmath123 , i.e. , @xmath133 .",
    "it represents sequence   with no internal fragments , @xmath107 .",
    "this configuration is actually equivalent to @xmath134 with @xmath135 .",
    "( ) the introduced fragments of particle trajectories may be characterized by other classification parameters , denoted symbolically as @xmath136 , in addition to the initial and terminal time moments of their realization , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows such parameters for the terminal fragments of @xmath139 too .",
    "the collection @xmath140 is determined by the specific details we want to know about the time pattern @xmath101 . in the present paper",
    "all the random walks in @xmath87 will be separated into different groups considered individually according to the largest amplitude @xmath141 attained by the variable @xmath59 during the corresponding time interval @xmath142 $ ] . as will be clear below",
    ", this classification can implemented imposing the addition requirement on each fragment of random walks outside the region @xmath3 that bounds variations of the variable @xmath59 inside it .",
    "namely , we assume the variable @xmath59 not to exceed @xmath141 , @xmath143 in this case each set @xmath144 contains only one parameter taking the same value for all of them .",
    "for the terminal fragment @xmath145 a similar condition holds .",
    "for the random walks inside the region @xmath3 there are no additional classification parameters , so the sets @xmath146 are empty .",
    "@xmath147    the constructed partition enables us to develop a more sophisticated description of the pattern @xmath67 , in particular , consider its configurations where the amplitudes of its @xmath148 largest peaks take given values @xmath149 . for sure , such analysis will allow us to penetrate much deeper into the properties of lvy flights , which , however , is worthy of individual investigation .",
    "the remaining part of the paper will be devoted to the statistical properties of random walks described in terms of the constructed partition . before this , however , let us discuss the relationship between the given classification of the particle motion and the well - known model of continuous time random walks ( ctrw ) .",
    "the ctrw model imitates random motion of particles by assigning to each jump of a wandering particle a jump length @xmath1 and a waiting time @xmath8 elapsing between two successive jumps which are distributed with a certain joint probability density @xmath150 .",
    "when it is possible to write this probability density as the product of the individual probability densities of jump length , @xmath151 , and waiting time , @xmath152 , i.e. , @xmath153 , the two quantities can be regarded as independent random variables and the model is called decoupled ctrw .",
    "another widely met version of this model , coupled ctrw , writes the probability density @xmath150 as the product of two functions @xmath154 or @xmath155 . in the given case",
    "the jump parameters @xmath1 and @xmath8 are no longer independent random variables ; the independent variables are the jump length @xmath1 ( or the waiting time @xmath8 ) and the mean particle velocity @xmath156 .",
    "the continuous implementation of the coupled ctrw is based on the assumption that within one jump the particle moves along the straight line connecting its initial and terminal points with the fixed velocity @xmath157 .",
    "the constructed partition can be regarded as a certain generalization of ctrw that allows one to consider the detailed structure of elementary steps .",
    "indeed , a pair of succeeding fragments of random walks inside , @xmath158 , and outside , @xmath159 , the region @xmath3 form an elementary step of the equivalent discrete random walks whose jump length and waiting time are random variables .",
    "if the random walks inside the region @xmath3 do not contribute substantially to the particle displacement @xmath1 we may speak about a stochastic process similar to coupled ctrw .",
    "the main difference between the two processes is due to the fact that the particle under consideration does not move uniformly within the fragment @xmath159 .",
    "so the knowledge of the corresponding mean velocity is not enough to describe the real particle motion .",
    "the random walks inside the region @xmath3 can be essential for the particle motion in space when , for example , a wandering particle spends the main time inside the region @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the corresponding stochastic process may be categorized as coupled - decoupled ctrw . in the case under consideration , as will be demonstrated below , the random walks inside the region @xmath3 are not responsible for the lvy type behavior of the particle motion .",
    "however , the constructed partition actually does not require the normal behavior of random walks near the origin @xmath4 , so it could be also used for modeling stochastic processes with kinetic coefficients exhibiting singularities at @xmath4 .",
    "under such conditions the random walks inside the region @xmath3 are also able to cause anomalous properties of wandering particles , giving rise to the power - law distribution of the waiting time .      continuing the constructions of sec .",
    "[ sec : tc ] the present section analyzes the statistical properties of the random trajectories @xmath101 meeting condition   that are imposed upon all the fragments of the random walks outside the region @xmath3 .",

    "the characteristic feature of the considered stochastic process is the fact that such nonlinear dependence of the noise intensity on the particle velocity gives rise to a multiscale time pattern @xmath69 and the spatial particle displacement is mainly caused by the velocity extreme fluctuations , i.e. , large peaks of the given pattern @xcite .",
    "in particular , if we consider the velocity pattern @xmath69 of duration @xmath8 then the particle displacement @xmath1 within the corresponding time interval can be evaluated as @xmath368 , where @xmath369 is the amplitude of the largest peak available in the given pattern and @xmath23 is a `` microscopic '' time scale characterizing the velocity correlations . as a result ,",
    "the statistical properties of the velocity fluctuations cause the lvy time scaling of the characteristic length @xmath12 of particle displacement and endow the distribution function @xmath9 with the appropriate power - law asymptotics .",
    "this feature has made it attractive to represent a trajectory of the wandering particle or , speaking more strictly , the time pattern @xmath69 as a sequence of peaks of duration about @xmath23 and to consider each peak as a certain implementation of one discrete step of the particle motion .",
    "unfortunately such an approach can not be constructed directly because the time pattern @xmath69 as a random trajectory is not a smooth curve . to overcome this obstacle a complex neighborhood @xmath3 of the line @xmath370 on the phase plane @xmath0 has been introduced .",
    "it contains two boundaries @xmath371 and @xmath372 , where the choice of the parameters @xmath373 , @xmath374 meeting the inequality @xmath375 is determined by the simplicity of mathematical constructions .",
    "the presence of the two boundaries has enabled us to introduce the notion of random walks outside and inside the neighborhood @xmath3 .",
    "the notion of random walks outside @xmath3 describes a fragment of the particle motion in the region @xmath376 without touching the lower boundary @xmath377 until the particle gets it for the first time .",
    "random walks inside the neighborhood @xmath3 correspond to a fragment of the particle motion inside the region @xmath378 without touching the upper boundary @xmath371 again until the particle gets it for the first time . for the analyzed phenomena the initial particle velocity does not matter provided it is not too large . therefore the initial particle velocity was set equal to @xmath373 without loss of generality . in this way",
    "any trajectory of the particle motion is represented as a sequence of alternate fragments of random walks inside and outside the neighborhood @xmath3 . a complex unit ( basic unit ) made of two succeeding fragments of the particle random motion inside and outside @xmath3",
    "may be treated as a continuous implementation of one step of the equivalent discrete random walks .",
    "the individual duration and the resulting length of these basic units are partly correlated random variables .",
    "it enables us to regard the constructed representation of random trajectories as a certain generalization of continuous time random walks ( ctrw ) .",
    "the main difference between the ctrw model and the model developed here is the fact that the particle is not assumed to move uniformly along the straight line connecting the terminal points of one step .",
    "for the analyzed model   it has been demonstrated that the particle motion inside the neighborhood @xmath3 practically contributes only to the duration of the basic units .",
    "the particle motion outside @xmath3 determines the spatial displacement as well as contributes to the basic unit duration too . in the given model the kinetic coefficients ,",
    "i.e. , the friction coefficient @xmath45 and the noise intensity @xmath44 exhibit no singularities at @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the distribution of the basic unit duration has no anomalous properties and , thereby , there is a linear relationship @xmath379 between the running time @xmath8 and the number of basic units @xmath177 , naturally , for @xmath236 and , so , for @xmath212 .",
    "the proportionality coefficient @xmath380 has been obtained as a certain function of the model parameters . as a result , in describing statistical properties of such random walks",
    "the system may be characterized by the number @xmath177 of basic units imposing no requirements on the duration of the pattern @xmath69 as a whole .",
    "it should be pointed out that the developed classification of random trajectories holds within rather general assumptions about markovian stochastic processes .",
    "so it can be generalized to models where the kinetic coefficients exhibit essential singularities in the region of small velocities .",
    "however , in this case there is no direct proportionality between @xmath8 and @xmath177 , moreover , the integer @xmath177 has to be treated as a certain random variable ; a similar situation is met in modeling grain boundary diffusion as a stochastic processes of the subdiffusion type @xcite .    using the constructed trajectory classification",
    "the analyzed stochastic process has been reduced to a certain universal stochastic process @xmath320 for which the corresponding governing equation contains no parameters .",
    "moreover , the white gaussian noise enters this equation in the additive manner and the regular drift is a piece - wise constant function , namely , the @xmath381-function .",
    "it has been called the core stochastic process .",
    "all the basic parameters characterizing the generated random walks , e.g. , the exponent of the lvy scaling law , are specified by the model parameters via the corresponding coefficients in the transformation from the variable @xmath268 of the core stochastic process @xmath320 to the original particle velocity @xmath5 .",
    "namely , it is the transformation @xmath382 as well as the linear transformation of the core process time to the `` physical '' time , @xmath383 .",
    "this , in particular , explains us why the main results rigorously obtained for the superdiffusive regime of lvy flights hold also for the other possible regimes as demonstrated numerically @xcite .    in order to elucidate the basic properties of",
    "the random walks at hand the developed technique has been applied to the core stochastic process to construct the peak pattern @xmath384 subjected to the condition @xmath385 for all the moments of time , where @xmath272 is a certain given value .",
    "based on the probabilistic properties of the core stochastic process it has enabled us also to introduce the probability density @xmath386 that the maximum attained by the variable @xmath387 inside the pattern @xmath388 is equal to @xmath141 . the probability density @xmath386 has been studied in detail in the present paper . in particular , first , it has been found out that the region of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath386 is specified by the inequality @xmath301 , where @xmath389 .",

    ", as been demonstrated , the asymptotic properties of the generated random walks can be formulated in terms of the core stochastic process as follows .    * on time scales @xmath29 large fluctuations in the spatial displacement @xmath1 of the wandering particle are implemented mainly via its motion within the single peak of the pattern @xmath388 whose amplitude is maximal in comparison with the other peaks and attains extremely large values . *",
    "the region @xmath391 of large fluctuations in the particle spatial displacement @xmath1 matches directly the region @xmath322 of the extreme values",
    "@xmath141 attained by the variable @xmath323 inside the pattern @xmath388 . * the asymptotic behavior of the distribution function @xmath9 in the region @xmath391",
    "is practically specified by the asymptotic behavior of the probability density @xmath305 inside the region @xmath322 .",
    "* the lower boundary @xmath12 of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath9 determines the characteristic displacement of the wandering particle during the time interval @xmath8 .",
    "so it can be evaluated using the single - peak approximation and setting the value @xmath141 equal @xmath392 , i.e. , @xmath325 .",
    "it should be reminded that @xmath392 is also the lower boundary of the @xmath141-region wherein the single - peak approximation holds .",
    "in addition it is worthwhile to note that , first , in studying the extreme characteristics of particle motion outside the neighborhood @xmath3 the shape of the velocity pattern @xmath69 can be approximated using the most probable trajectory @xmath393 .",
    "in particular using these results the asymptotics of the distribution function @xmath9 has be constructed and demonstrated to coincide with the rigorous results within a cofactor about unity .",
    "it opens a gate to modeling such processes in heterogeneous media constructing the most optimal trajectories of particle motion in nonuniform environment .",
    "second , the first item above can be regarded as a certain implementation of the single - peak approximation .",
    "it is based on the use of the condition @xmath385 in constructing the pattern @xmath388 .",

    "it is necessary to consider a more complex system of restrictions @xmath394 with the independent external boundaries @xmath395 for different peaks . in this case",
