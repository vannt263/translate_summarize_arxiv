    "after the discovery of a higgs boson in july 2012 @xcite , an intense period of analysis of its properties has begun and is bearing fruits .",
    "we now know that this object is very consistent with the spinless scalar state embedded in the sm .",
    "following the precision measurement of its mass , around 125 gev , its couplings to all other states of the sm can be derived and compared with experimental data .",
    "agreement between sm and experimental results is presently within a few tens of percent at worse , thus leaving some scope for a beyond the sm ( bsm ) higgs sector .    by bearing in mind that the discovered higgs state has a doublet nature , amongst the many new physics scenarios available embedding such structures , those easier to deal with are clearly 2-higgs doublet models ( 2hdms ) .",
    "in fact , these scenarios always include a neutral scalar higgs state that can play the role of the discovered one , which  as intimated  is very sm - like . furthermore , they are also easily compliant with past collider data ( from lep / slc and tevatron ) as well as present ones ( from the lhc ) while still offering a wealth of new higgs states and corresponding signals that can be searched for by the atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "in fact , a significant amount of experimental effort at the lhc is presently being spared on direct searches for new higgs bosons , in parallel with the one of extracting their possible presence indirectly from the aforementioned precision measurements .    however , 2hdms _ per se _ do not have the ability to solve the so - called hierarchy problem of the sm . an elegant way to do so though",
    ", is to presume that the higgs boson discovered in 2012 and its possible 2hdm companions are not fundamental particles .",
    "this approach is not unreasonable as any other ( pseudo)scalar state found in nature eventually revealed itself to be a ( fermion ) composite state , i.e. , a mesonic state of the now standard theory of strong interactions ( qcd ) .",
    "specifically , one can construct 2hdms in which all higgs bosons , both neutral and charged , both scalar or pseudoscalar , are not fundamental , rather composite .",
    "a phenomenologically viable possibility , wherein the mass of the lightest higgs state is kept naturally lighter than a new strong scale ( of compositeness , @xmath6 , in the @xmath7 tev region ) is , in particular , the one of assigning to them a pngb nature .",
    "in essence , we have in mind those composite higgs models ( chms ) with an approximate global symmetry @xcite broken by sm interactions through the _ partial compositeness _ paradigm of refs . @xcite .    in the minimal chm @xcite , the composite version of the sm higgs doublet ,",
    "the only light scalar in the spectrum is indeed a pngb ( surrounded by various composite resonances , both spin-1/2 and spin-1 , generally heavier ) .",
    "hence , it is natural to assume that the new ( pseudo)scalar higgs states of a c2hdm are also pngbs .",
    "in fact , even in the case in which they are eventually found to be heavier than the sm - like higgs state , compositeness could provide a mechanism to explain their mass differences with respect to the latter .",
    "finally , in the case of extra higgs doublets with no vacuum expectation value ( vev ) nor couplings to quark and leptons , one could also have neutral light states as possible composite dark matter candidates @xcite .",
    "c2hdms embedding pngbs arising from a new strong dynamics at the tev scale , ultimately driving electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , can be constructed or by adopting an effective lagrangian description ( see example @xcite ) invariant under sm symmetries for light composite @xmath8 higgses ; or by explicitly imposing a specific symmetry breaking structure containing multiple pngbs .",
    "we take here the second approach . in detail",
    ", we will analyse 2hdms based on the spontaneous global symmetry breaking of an @xmath0 symmetry @xcite . within this construct , which we have tackled in a previous paper @xcite , one",
    "can then study both the deviations of c2hdm couplings from those of a generic renormalizable e2hdm @xcite as well as pursue searches for new non - sm - like higgs signals different from the elementary case . in the @xmath9",
    "limit the pngb states are in fact identified with the physical higgs states of doublet scalar fields of the e2hdm and deviations from the e2hdm are parametrized by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the sm higgs vev .",
    "once the new strong sector is integrated out , the pngb higgses , independently of their microscopic origin , are described by a non - linear @xmath12-model associated to the coset . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have constructed their effective low - energy lagrangian according to the prescription developed by callan , coleman , wess and zumino ( ccwz ) @xcite , which makes only few specific assumptions about the strong sector , namely , the global symmetries , their pattern of spontaneous breaking and the sources of explicit breaking ( in our case they come from the couplings of the new strong sector with the sm fields ) .",
    "the scalar potential is in the end generated by loop effects and , at the lowest order , is mainly determined by the free parameters associated to the top sector @xcite .",
    "however , both in ref .",
    "@xcite and here , we will not calculate the ensuing higgs potential _ a la _ coleman - weinberg ( cw ) @xcite generated by such radiative corrections , instead",
    ", we will assume the same general form as in the e2hdm with a @xmath2 symmetry , the latter imposed in order to avoid flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) at the tree level  @xcite .",
    "we do so in order to study the phenomenology of c2hdms in a rather model independent way , as this approach in fact allows for the most general 2hdm higgs potential .",
    "it is our intention to eventually construct the true version of the latter through the proper cw mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , first we intend to infer guidance in approaching this task from the study of theoretical ( i.e. , perturbativity , unitarity , vacuum stability , triviality , etc . ",
    "the subject of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and experimental ( one of the subjects of the present paper ) constraints , specifically , by highlighting the parameter space regions where differences can be found between the e2hdm and c2hdm .",
    "this will inform the choice of how to construct a phenomenologically viable and different ( from the e2hdm ) realization of a c2hdm in terms of underlying gauge symmetries , their breaking patterns and the ensuing new bosonic and fermionic spectrum , that is , indeed , to settle on a specific model dependence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the c2hdm based on @xmath13 . in section",
    "iii , the lhc phenomenology is discussed in presence of both theoretical and experimental constraints .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  iv . in appendix",
    "a , relevant feynman rules for the phenomenological study are presented .",
    "we construct the lagrangian of the c2hdm based on the spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry @xmath0 at a scale @xmath6 . in this model ,",
    "two isospin doublet ( pseudo)scalar fields emerge as pngbs from such a breaking pattern . in our approach , we do not specify the physics at any scale above a ( large ) cutoff @xmath14 which is expected to be @xmath15 from a nave dimensional analysis  @xcite , i.e. , we do not fix the concrete structure of the gauge and matter contents . even in this setup ,",
    "the kinetic term of the pngbs is uniquely determined by the structure of the global symmetry breaking . for the yukawa sector",
    "though , we need to assume an embedding scheme for sm fermions into @xmath1 multiplets to build the lagrangian at low energy .",
    "although in this framework the scalar potential is generated via the cw mechanism at loop level @xcite , as intimated , we assume here its renormalisable form of the e2hdm .",
    "this gives a sort of more generic approach to the potential , namely , once the cw potential is calculated in a fixed configuration , all the potential terms can be translated into a few parameters describing the new strong sector .",
    "we therefore adopt the same setup of @xcite , to which we refer the reader for further details of the model construction .",
    "we construct the @xmath16 pngb matrix @xmath17 using the eight broken generators generators given in ref .",
