    "in table  [ tab : optical ] , we list all pulsars in binaries outside of globular clusters .",
    "one sees that their properties vary widely , but one can identify different types on the basis of the spin and orbital properties . for instance , systems separate in clusters by inferred companion mass and orbital period , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : porbvsmass ] .",
    "below , we briefly describe the different groups and their evolutionary histories ( for reviews , see phinney & kulkarni 1994 ; stairs 2004 ) .",
    "pulsars with massive stellar companions , which formed in binaries in which one star went supernova .",
    "the pulsars are like young , isolated pulsars . probably , there are many more psr+ob(e ) systems in which the pulsar is hidden by the companion s stellar wind .",
    "there should also be pulsars with lower - mass companions , but as yet no secure identifications have been made ( a candidate is psr b1820@xmath011 ; phinney & verbunt 1991 ) .",
    "pulsars formed second in massive binaries , with the first - formed neutron star as a companion . for the one system",
    "known , the first - born neutron star is a pulsar as well , but recycled ( see below ) .      in binaries with two stars just below the critical mass required to form a neutron star , the originally more massive star will evolve first and leave a white dwarf . in the process , it may transfer sufficient amounts of matter to make the originally lighter star massive enough to explode , leaving a newly formed pulsar in an eccentric orbit around a massive white dwarf .      in binaries with a massive star and a neutron - star companion , the star will eventually evolve . unless the orbit is very wide , it will overflow its roche lobe , and unstable mass transfer to the neutron star will ensue , leading to a spiral in .",
    "the accretion of matter on the neutron star spins it up and , by mechanisms unknown , reduces the magnetic field .",
    "the resulting ` recycled ' pulsar is left in a binary with another neutron star when the remaining helium core is heavy enough to go supernova .",
    "the orbit will be eccentric .",
    "these systems are also called ` high - mass binary pulsars ' ( hmbp ) . for one system ,",
    "the companion neutron star is a pulsar as well .",
    "if , in the above scenario , the helium core is not massive enough to explode , it will form a white dwarf with a co or onemg core and a helium envelope .",
    "a massive white dwarf can also be left if the companion of the pulsar evolved up to the agb before overflowing its roche lobe .",
    "the latter scenario may lead to more accretion , and thus a neutron star spun up to faster periods and with a more strongly reduced magnetic field .",
    "the white dwarf might still have a hydrogen envelope .",
    "in either case , the orbit will be circular .",
    "these systems are also referred to as ` intermediate mass binary pulsars ' ( imbp ) .      if the companion of a neutron star is a low - mass star , the mass transfer that ensues when it evolves and overfills its roche lobe is stable .",
    "a lot of mass is transferred , leading to fast spin periods and low magnetic fields , as well as , presumably , greatly increased mass .",
    "if mass transfer started before the helium flash , a helium - core white dwarf will be left , with a hydrogen envelope .",
    "if it started afterwards , a white dwarf with a co core will be formed , and the atmosphere may be either hydrogen or helium . in either case ,",
    "one expects a circular orbit .",
    "these systems are also called ` low - mass binary pulsars ' ( lmbp ) .",
    "recycled pulsars are also found with companions with masses more similar to brown dwarfs .",
    "these companions likely originally had higher mass , but lost most of it in a long x - ray binary phase .",
    "the systems are also called ` very low - mass binary pulsars ' ( vlmbp ) or , because of the strong irradiation and evaporation observed , ` black widow pulsars . '",
    "the various evolutionary scenarios lead to predictions for the properties of the binary pulsars we observe . in particular for the recycled pulsars with low - mass white - dwarf companions , which evolved via stable mass transfer , the predictions seem secure : there should be a relation between companion mass and orbital period , one between eccentricity and orbital period , and the neutron - star masses should have increased ( for a review , phinney & kulkarni 1994 ) .    of these predictions ,",
    "the second has been verified ( phinney & kulkarni 1994 ) , but the lack of accurate masses prevented stringent tests of the other two . with continuing high - precision timing , however , the situation has changed .",
    "for instance , nice , splaver , & stairs ( 2004 , these proceedings ) have uncovered clear evidence that the neutron stars are more massive than the typical 1.35@xmath1 inferred from double neutron - star binaries ( thorsett & chakrabarty 1999 ; these should have accreted little ) .",
    "timing measurements , as well as optical studies ( see below ) , have also yielded a number of accurate companion masses , which allow a much improved test of the relation between companion mass and orbital period . in fig .",
    "[ fig : porbmwd ] , we show these masses , with model predictions of tauris & savonije ( 1999 ) overdrawn .",
    "the agreement is impressive , especially when one considers that the models were produced before the accurate masses became available .",
    "in the table with all binary pulsars ( table  [ tab : optical ] ) , we also summarise what is known optically .",
    "one sees that for the pulsars with massive stellar companions , which should be bright , two out of three are identified ; the third ( psr j1740@xmath03052 ) is highly obscured . also for the two ` back widow ' pulsars , the two strongly irradiated , bloated , brown  dwarf mass companions have been identified .",

    "unfortunately , the results were less constraining than hoped .",
    "first , the radial - velocity amplitudes found by the two teams were different .",
    "it turned out this was related to a reduction error by van kerkwijk et al .",

    "this result should still improve , once small remaining systematic effects have been taken into account .",
    "from the two estimates , the current best estimate of the mass ratio is @xmath52 .",

    "( 1996 ) found @xmath53 , while callanan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) inferred @xmath54 .",
    "for this difference , the underlying cause turned out to be two different sets of model atmospheres used ( by p.  bergeron and d.  koester , respectively ) . when the spectra of van kerkwijk et al",
    ".  were fitted using the koester models , a surface gravity consistent with that of callanan et al .",
    "is found ( d.  koester , pers.comm . ) .",
    "finally , it was found that for the very low masses involved , the mass - radius relation was less securely known than expected .",
    "coincidentally , the slightly different approaches taken by the two teams compensated the differences in surface gravity , leading to the same final white dwarf mass , @xmath55 .",
    "the above mass and mass ratio correspond to a neutron star mass of @xmath56 , where the uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the white - dwarf mass .",
    "if instead we use the white - dwarf mass expected from the models of tauris & savonije ( 1998 ) , @xmath57 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : porbmwd ] ) , we infer a neutron star mass of @xmath58 .",
    "this is a large mass , but similar to is found for psr j0751 + 1807 by nice et al.(2004 , these proceedings ) . clearly , it will be worthwile to try to determine the white - dwarf mass more accurately .    the above procedure",
    "was also tried on another short - period pulsar binary , psr j0218 + 4232 .",
    "this system is substantially fainter ( @xmath59 ; table  [ tab : optical ] ) , and , unfortunately , it turned out to be beyond the capabilities of the then - available instrumentation : while an accurate temperature could be determined , no useful constraints could be derived on the surface gravity and radial - velocity amplitude ( bassa , van kerkwijk , & kulkarni 2003a ) .",
    "obviously , the current large uncertainties are somewhat discouraging .",
    "fortunately , on all fronts improvements are being made .",
    "first , two more bright counterparts to recycled pulsars have been discovered , to psr j1909@xmath03744 and j1738 + 0333 ( see table  [ tab : optical ] ) .",
    "both have spectra similar to j1012 + 5307 , and thus similar temperatures and surface gravities . of the two , psr j1909@xmath03744 is particularly interesting , as the orbit is sufficiently edge - on to allow for an accurate determination of the white - dwarf mass from shapiro delay ( jacoby et al .",
    "combined with much improved white - dwarf mass - radius relations ( from detailed cooling models ; see below ) , this implies we will know the surface gravity of the white dwarf , which we can use to calibrate the model - atmosphere analysis .",
    "the second improvement is that more blue - sensitive and more stable spectrographs are now available on large telescopes , and hence more precise radial - velocity curves can be measured .",
    "it should be possible to obtain mass ratios to better than @xmath60% accuracy .",
    "observing campaigns of both new pulsar binaries are underway .",
    "we conclude by mentioning one last system , psr b0820 + 02 , for which it has been possible to derive an accurate companion mass , @xmath61 ( koester & reimers 2000 ) .",
    "this mass is similar to the masses found for isolated white dwarfs , for which the white - dwarf model atmospheres and mass - radius relations are well understood .",
    "hence , it should be reliable .",
    "unfortunately , the system is unsuitable for determining the neutron star mass , as the orbit is too wide to determine an accurate radial - velocity curve .",
    "however , as we will see below , the accurate white - dwarf mass and temperature allow for interesting constraints on the cooling age .",
    "after the last bit of mass is transferred from the progenitor of the white dwarf to the neutron star , two independent clocks start running .",
    "the first clock is the millisecond pulsar , which will turn on and start slowing down . assuming a spin - down torque @xmath62 , the pulsar age is given by @xmath63 , \\label{eq : tpsr}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the current spin period",
    ", @xmath65 is its rate of change , @xmath66 is the period when the pulsar began spinning down following cessation of mass transfer , and @xmath67 is the `` braking index , '' equal to 3 under the assumption of magnetic dipole radiation . for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the pulsar `` characteristic age . ''",
    "the second clock is the white dwarf .",
    "after the remaining envelope has been burned off , the white dwarf can only radiate its internal heat , making it cool down as time goes by . in principle , it is fairly easy to estimate the cooling , as the thermal structure of the white dwarf is simple .",
    "the heat is stored in the non - degenerate ions in the white dwarf interior , which is kept nearly isothermal due to the efficient heat conduction by degenerate electrons .",
    "the cooling rate is determined by the much less efficient radiative heat transport near the white dwarf s atmosphere .    in practice , there are complications . apart from difficulties in modelling the radiative opacities and dealing with convection",
    ", there are two additional physical processes that play a role .",
    "first , at low temperatures , the ion gas in the core starts to crystallise .",
    "the latent heat released temporarily keeps the white dwarf warmer , but once gone , allows for much more rapid cooling .",
    "this effect is particularly important for more massive , carbon - oxygen white dwarfs .",
    "second , for white dwarfs with relatively thick residual hydrogen envelopes , the pressure at the bottom can be sufficiently high for significant pycno - nuclear fusion , keeping the white dwarf warm longer .",
    "we will return to this below .",
    "the possible use of comparing pulsar and white - dwarf ages was realized immediately upon the first detection of optical emission from white - dwarf counterparts ( kulkarni 1986 ) .",
    "for the white dwarf accompanying psr b0655 + 64 , a relatively low temperature , @xmath72k , was inferred , which implied an age of @xmath73gyr .",
    "this meant that pulsar magnetic fields could not decay completely on this timescale , as had been common wisdom at the time .",
    "the first systematic comparison between spin - down and cooling ages was done by hansen & phinney ( 1998a , b ) . since they had to rely on estimated masses ,",
    "their results were uncertain , but two clear discrepancies stood out : for psr j1012 + 5307 , the inferred cooling age was far shorter than the characteristic age , while for psr b0820 + 02 , the cooling age was significantly longer . we discuss both discrepancies in turn .      already in their discovery paper of psr j1012 + 5307 s optical counterpart , lorimer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) noted that the white dwarf was much hotter than expected given the pulsar s characteristic age .",
    "they suggested that the problem might lie in the pulsar age : if the initial period to which the pulsar was spun up was similar to the current one ( i.e. , @xmath74 instead of @xmath75 in eq .  1 )",
    ", then the pulsar age could be equal to a short cooling age .",
    "alberts et al .  ( 1996 ) , however , suggested the white - dwarf age had been underestimated : given the low mass , the hydrogen layer on the white dwarf could be quite thick , and residual hydrogen burning could keep the white dwarf hot . indeed , this effect had already been found by webbink ( 1975 ) , in a general study of the evolution of helium white dwarfs in close binaries .",
    "a flurry of modelling followed , confirming the likely presence of a thick hydrogen layer ( driebe et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) , and adding complications , such as the duration of the semi - detached phase in which the companion is becoming a white dwarf ( sarna , antipova , & muslimov 1998 ) . at first",
    ", the new models seemed to suggest that most low - mass white - dwarf companions should be fairly bright , but this was disproven by the discovery of a very faint counterpart to psr b1855 + 09 ( van kerkwijk et al .",
    "this led to more careful considerations of the effects of shell flashes during the formation ( e.g. , schnberner , driebe , & blcker 2000 ) , and to the effects of element diffusion on these flashes ( sarna , ergma , & gerkevit - antipova 2000 ; althaus , serenelli , & benvenuto 2001a , b ) .",
    "the current consensus appears to be that below a certain critical mass , the hydrogen layer should be thick and white dwarfs should be relatively hot , @xmath76k even when several gyr old . above the critical mass ,",
    "shell flashes occur , and the hydrogen layer will be too thin to sustain significant residual fusion ; after several gyr , those more massive white dwarfs will have cooled to below 5000k .",
    "the precise value of the critical mass is not known , but , since the shell flashes result from cno burning , almost certainly depends on metallicity ( sarna et al .",

    "+ @xmath79 temperatures are from colours or spectra , except for j2317 + 1439 and j1911@xmath01114 , for which the limits were derived from the magnitude limit , combined with the cordes & lazio distance .",
    "these are marked with a colon to indicate they are uncertain .",
    "+ @xmath77 b0820 + 02 has a co wd companion , but formed like a lmbp .    until recently , there was not much supporting observational evidence",
    "indeed , except for psr j1012 + 5307 , all identified white dwarf counterparts were rather cool , implying thin hydrogen envelopes .",
    "could it be that thick envelopes did not occur at all , and that psr j1012 + 5307 was re - born with @xmath74 after all ( bassa et al.2003a ) ?",
    "additional evidence for the presence of thick hydrogen envelopes was uncovered with the identification of rather bright and hot white - dwarf counterparts to two new pulsars with large characteristic ages ( psr j1909@xmath03744 and psr j1738 + 0333 ; see table  [ tab : optical ] ) . with those , it has become possible to try to determine empirically the critical mass below which hydrogen layers will be thick",
    "unfortunately , we do not have accurate masses for most white - dwarf companions .",
    "however , we can use the orbital period as a proxy , as this should correlate fairly tightly with the companion mass ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : porbmwd ] and section 1 ) .    in table",
    "[ tab : hlayer ] , we list the properties for those low - mass binary pulsars that either have periods less than 3 days or have measured companion masses .",
    "the final column lists whether a thick or a thin hydrogen envelope is required to understand the observed temperature ( assuming the white - dwarf cooling age is similar to the characteristic age ) .",
    "one sees that for all systems with orbital periods in excess of 1.55d , thin hydrogen envelopes are inferred , while below that period they are likely thick ( with one exception ; see below ) . for the system just below the critical period , psr j1909@xmath03744",
    ", we have a mass estimate from shapiro delay . the preliminary results from jacoby et al .",
    "( 2004 , in prep . ) , is @xmath80 .",
    "this is slightly more massive than found from the models of , e.g. , althaus et al .",
    "( 2001b ) , which suggest that @xmath81 white dwarfs should still have thin envelopes . however , given the uncertainties ( e.g. , in metallicity ; serenelli et al .",
    "2002 ) , the agreement seems satisfactory .",
    "while the above paints a consistent picture , there is one exception : for psr j0751@xmath01807 , a low temperature is measured ( bassa , van kerkwijk , & kulkarni 2004 ) .",
    "a low temperature had already been indicated by earlier limits of lundgren et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , and ergma , sarna , & gerkevit - antipova ( 2001 ) suggested the hydrogen envelope might have been reduced shortly after the mass transfer ceased , due to irradiation by the pulsar ( which would be particularly effective in such a close binary ) .",
    "intriguingly , however , our photometry seems to indicate that the white dwarf has no hydrogen whatsoever , but instead a helium atmosphere .",
    "the second discrepancy identified by hansen & phinney ( 1998b ) was that the cooling age for psr b0820 + 02 was significantly longer than the characteristic age .",
    "this was confirmed by koester & reimers ( 2000 ) , who analysed spectra of the optical companion and inferred @xmath82k and @xmath83 .",
    "combined with cooling models , this yields a mass of @xmath84 .",
    "this mass implies a co core , and is typical for an isolated white dwarf , not unexpected given the very wide orbit , and the fact that the pulsar appears to have been recycled only very mildly ( @xmath85s ; @xmath86 g ) .",
    "for a mass of @xmath87 , the implied cooling age is @xmath88myr , which is significantly above the pulsar s characteristic age , @xmath89myr .",
    "koester & reimers ( 2000 ) argue that the white - dwarf cooling models for these masses are secure , and hence that the pulsar age must be larger than the characteristic age . from eq .  1",
    ", one sees that the only way to do that is to decrease the breaking index @xmath23 ; consistency with the cooling age would then require @xmath90 .",
    "if true , the above implies that pulsar spin - down is different from magnetic dipole braking not just for young pulsars ( e.g. , lyne 1996 ) , but also for older ones . as yet , however , the conclusion is less firm than it might appear : the uncertainty in the age listed by koester & reimers ( 2000 ) does not seem to include the uncertainty in the mass of the object . for a less massive white dwarf , the cooling age would be reduced ( e.g. , 150myr for a @xmath91 white dwarf ; see also schnberner et al .",
    "this can be verified with better spectra .      with the cooling models in quantitative agreement with the observations , it has become possible to use them .",
    "one particularly interesting case is psr j1911@xmath05958a in the globular cluster ngc 6752 .",
    "this binary is puzzling as it is very far , @xmath92 half - mass radii outside the core ( damico et al .",
    "2002 ; also possenti et al .  2004 , these proceedings ) , and it is unclear how it could have gotten there .",
    "colpi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) investigated different possibilities , and found it was difficult to produce the system either from a primordial binary or by a scattering or exchange event .",
    "instead , they suggested that the binary may have been scattered by a binary composed of two fairly massive black holes . in this scenario ,",
    "the binary would already have formed before the scattering event .",
    "an age estimate could be used to distinguish between the various possibilities . for a primordial origin or an older binary being scattered by a binary black hole",
    ", the white dwarf would most likely be rather old .",
    "if the white dwarf was formed during or shortly after an exchange , however , it could not be much older than the @xmath93gyr the binary can be expected to stay in the outskirts if it is currently on a highly eccentric orbit in the cluster ( colpi et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "it turned out that archival eso wide field imager and _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 images were available of the field , and those allowed us to identify the white - dwarf companion of psr j1911@xmath05958a ( bassa et al .",
    "2003b ; the source was also identified in new vlt observations by ferraro et al .",
    "it is relatively bright and hot , with a best - fit temperature of @xmath94k .",
    "as the distance is known , we have a measure of the radius ; the implied mass is low , about @xmath95 , as expected from the pulsar mass function .",
    "the high temperature implies that the white dwarf is rather young , @xmath96gyr , even if it has a thick hydrogen layer ( at the low cluster metallicity , the critical mass is about @xmath97 ; serenelli et al .",
    "this suggests that the system was formed in a simple exchange interaction with another star or binary in the core .",
    "independent of its formation , the system is interesting simply because it is sufficiently bright , @xmath98 , to allow spectroscopy , and measure the white dwarf and neutron star masses using the procedure outlined in section 3 .",
    "an advantage over systems in the field is that the distance is known , which means one can measure the white - dwarf radius using the flux and temperature , and thus have a second constraint on the white - dwarf mass .",
