    ", the on - axis wave vectors for all three compounds correspond to a very well - defined sharp maximum in @xmath83 calculated from the sections of the fs associated with the double te layers ( figure  [ fig : chiq](b ) ) .",
    "a substantial fraction of the fs coming from these double layers are nested by this wave vector , as indicated by vertical arrows in figure  [ fig : fsnesting ] .",
    "the actual modulation wave vectors are very close to the maximum in @xmath83 , and @xmath100 is smaller by less than 5@xmath17 compared to the calculated _ global _ maximum .",
    "this striking correspondence is highly suggestive that the double te layers drive the _ on - axis _ cdw .",
    "the simpler double - layer compound @xmath0te@xmath4 also exhibits an on - axis superlattice modulation , also corresponding to a similarly well - defined peak in the susceptibility . in that case , the wave vector @xmath98@xmath245/7@xmath14=0.71@xmath14 over the entire range of the compounds(@xmath0=la - tm),@xcite which is also very close to @xmath98 for @xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "the difference in @xmath101 values between the two families of compounds can be attributed to differences in band filling , as well as to the more complicated electronic structure in @xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , the similarity in the nesting mechanism driving the _ on - axis _ modulation in the two compounds , and its stability across the rare earth series for both families , is remarkable .",
    "given the clear correlation between the on - axis modulation wave vectors and @xmath83 , it is natural to reason that the off - axis wave vectors might be more closely associated with the single te planes .",
    "indeed , with the possible exception of nd@xmath3te@xmath2 , none of the three compounds studied exhibit any obvious correlation between the off - axis wave vectors and @xmath83 , whereas , as we show below , there is a close correlation with @xmath82 , at least for sm@xmath3te@xmath2 and gd@xmath3te@xmath2 .",
    "however , the off - axis modulation is not as simple to account for as the on - axis modulation . in particular",
    ", there is considerable variation in the off - axis wave vectors for the three compounds studied ( table ii ) , reminiscent of the variation in the lattice modulation for the simpler single - layer compound @xmath0te@xmath3 ( @xmath0 = la - er ) .",
    "consequently , we consider each of the three compounds separately below .",
    "first , sm@xmath3te@xmath2 .",
    "for this compound , the off - axis modulation lies along the @xmath12-axis , with an incommensurate wave vector @xmath102 ( here we preserve the notation  _ off - axis _ \" to indicate that @xmath40 is not oriented parallel to @xmath31 , even though , in this case , @xmath40 lies along a high symmetry direction ) .",
    "as can be seen from the inset to figure  [ fig : chiq](c ) , this wave vector lies very near to the _ global _ maximum in @xmath82 , indicating that the single te layers do indeed play a significant role in driving this off - axis cdw .",
    "the behavior is also reminiscent of the unit cell doubling associated with the cdw superlattice found in some of the rare earth ditellurides @xmath0te@xmath3.@xcite    as described in section iii , sm@xmath3te@xmath2 is unique among the three compounds studied in that the mixed harmonics of the cdw modulations @xmath103 and @xmath104 are evident in sadp patterns .",
    "close inspection of the inset to figure  [ fig : chiq](b ) reveals that these wave vectors , which have a different incommensurate / commensurate structure in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions , are in fact closely associated with noticeably significant peak structures in @xmath83 .",
    "the same figure also shows that @xmath105 , equivalent to @xmath106 , is actually very near to another global maximum in @xmath83 adjacent to ( 101 ) .",
    "this maximum is equivalent to that which is close to @xmath31 by a simple reciprocal lattice translation , suggestive of a resonance in the interaction due to the crystal symmetry :    @xmath107    these observations suggest a significant coupling between the two wave vectors @xmath31 and @xmath40 in sm@xmath3te@xmath2 .",
    "even though the off - axis modulation is principally driven by the single te - planes ( i.e. @xmath40 is very close to the global maximum in @xmath82 ) nevertheless , it is not insensitive to the double layers . in contrast , the on- and off - axis cdw modulations in nd@xmath3te@xmath2 and gd@xmath3te@xmath2 seem to be independent or minimally coupled to each other , without any commensurate / incommensurate mixing .",
    "in contrast to sm@xmath3te@xmath2 , the off - axis cdw in gd@xmath3te@xmath2 is fully commensurate . although the modulation wave vectors @xmath108 and @xmath109 for gd@xmath3te@xmath2 are different to that observed in sm@xmath3te@xmath2 , both lie close to global maxima in @xmath82 , suggesting that the single te planes play the dominant role in driving the off - axis cdw for this compound , too . it is worth noting , however , that the peak structure in @xmath82 ( figure  [ fig : chiq](c ) ) is far less well developed than that in @xmath83 ( figure  [ fig : chiq](b ) ) . rather than",
    "a single _ global _ maximum with little in the way of additional features , @xmath82 exhibits a broad range of maxima along sharp  ridges \" ( dark red regions in figure  [ fig : chiq](c ) ) connecting four relatively sharp local peaks centered close to @xmath110=(0 0 0.5),(0.5 0 0),(-0.5 0 0 ) and ( 0 0 -0.5 ) .",
    "the resulting figure is reminiscent of similar calculations for the simpler single layer compound @xmath0te@xmath3 , which also lack a well - defined single peak , and for which the superlattice modulation vectors also vary across the rare earth series.@xcite we will return to the variation in the off axis wave vectors later .",
    "the two commensurate cdw vectors , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , in gd@xmath3te@xmath2 span the entire commensurate cdw super lattice peaks in @xmath111 space .",
    "such an extensive commensurate modulation structure may not allow a simple explanation in terms of perturbative higher harmonics . however , it is interesting to note that @xmath112 , a second harmonic of @xmath108 , lies exactly on top of an additional weak local maximum in @xmath82 , which may give some hint as to the origin of this extensive commensurate structure ( inset to figure  [ fig : chiq](c)-the strength of this feature depends sensitively on details of the calculation , but appears to be robust ) .",
    "specifically , rather than just a simple perturbation of @xmath108 , 2@xmath108 itself also seems to be directly coupled to the relevant electronic structure through the _ local maximum peak _ at @xmath113 .",
    "this effect coherently enhances the cdw instabilities at @xmath110=2@xmath108 and seems to help the commensuration mechanism of the off - axis cdw to extend to higher @xmath78 harmonics or integral multiple of @xmath108 , while it is , in contrast , weakly or minimally coupled to the on - axis cdw leaving that incommensurate .",
    "this behavior is in distinct contrast to that of the other two compounds studied , neither of which exhibits higher harmonics of the off - axis modulation vectors . by way of comparison with sm@xmath3te@xmath2",
    ", it is also worth noting that the off - axis cdw peaks in gd@xmath3te@xmath2 lie in a high but flat region , without any sharp peak features , when mapped onto @xmath83 of the ditelluride - like double te layers . as such , and in contrast to the case of sm@xmath3te@xmath2",
    ", the off - axis cdw wave vectors observed in gd@xmath3te@xmath2 appear to get enhanced mainly within the te single layer by this subtle interaction and develop an extensive commensurate cdw structure .",
    "although the off - axis lattice modulation is different for sm@xmath3te@xmath2 and gd@xmath3te@xmath2 , and although they each exhibit different resonant mechanisms which enhance the off - axis cdw based on interaction with the double or single te planes respectively , nevertheless , the off - axis cdw for both compounds appears to be principally driven by the single te planes .",
    "in sharp contrast , nd@xmath3te@xmath2 appears to defy this simple model .",
    "specifically , the off - axis modulation wave vectors for this compound do not lie close to the global maximum in @xmath82 ( triangular points in figure  [ fig : chiq](c ) ) . instead , they are found near _ local _ maxima which have values about 20@xmath17 less than the _ global _ maximum in both @xmath82 and @xmath83 , although these features are very weak .",
    "taken at face value , it appears that both single and double planes contribute towards the off - axis cdw in nd@xmath3te@xmath2 , although it is impossible from this analysis to determine whether one or the other plays a dominant role .",
    "one of the principle defining features of the off - axis lattice modulation is the huge variation between the three compounds studied , especially given the minimal differences observed in the on - axis wave vector . given that the electronic structure is essentially identical for all three compounds , this large variation suggests that differences in the phonon mode characteristics play an important role .",
    "the atomic masses of nd , sm and gd differ by up to 10@xmath17 , affecting the lattice instability through equation 5 .",
    "presumably , the very well - defined peak feature in @xmath83 ( figure  [ fig : chiq](b ) ) ensures that the on - axis wave vector remains tied to the wave vector at which this quantity peaks , even as the phonon modes and electron - phonon coupling change .",
    "however , the more poorly defined maximum in @xmath82 ( figure  [ fig : chiq](c ) ) is apparently not strong enough to completely dominate the electron - phonon coupling to the extent that variation in the phonon characteristics are able to affect the lattice modulation . this behavior is consistent with that of the single and double layer compounds @xmath0te@xmath3 and @xmath0te@xmath4 - the former having a poorly defined peak in @xmath15 and a lattice modulation very sensitive to changes in rare earth,@xcite the latter having a very well - defined peak in @xmath15 , and a lattice modulation that hardly changes across the entire rare earth series .",
    "in summary , we have presented an alternative method to prepare large , high - quality single crystals of @xmath1te@xmath2 ( @xmath0=nd , sm and gd ) via a binary self flux method , and have presented the first evidence for charge density wave formation in this material .",
    "all three compounds exhibit an _ on - axis _ modulation with @xmath114 along the @xmath14-direction , in combination with an _ off - axis _ superlattice which varies significantly between the three compounds studied . based on a consideration of contributions to the lindhard susceptibility from the single and double te planes of the layered structure",
    ", it appears that the on - axis cdw is driven by the double te planes , whereas the off - axis cdw is principally driven by the single te planes .",
    "resonant effects associated with coupling of higher harmonics of these modulation wave vectors to local features in the susceptibility of the double and single te planes appear to be relevant for sm@xmath3te@xmath2 and gd@xmath3te@xmath2 respectively , stabilizing in the first case mixed commensurate / incommensurate off - axis harmonics , and in the second an extensive commensurate structure associated with just the single te layers , decoupled from the on - axis modulation .",
