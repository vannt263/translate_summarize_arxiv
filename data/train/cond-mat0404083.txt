    "several results about critical phenomena have been recently obtained using monte carlo simulations in short - time regime @xcite .",
    "such simulations are more convenient than traditional ones done in the equilibrium regime because they circumvent a known problem in computational physics : the critical slowing down phenomena .    investigating monte carlo simulations before attaining equilibrium permits to us obtaining the static critical exponents ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) but also leads to the less known dynamical ones . the scaling equation for non - equilibrium regime",
    "was obtained by jansen _",
    "@xcite , on the basis of renormalization group theory . for systems",
    "without conserved quantities like energy and magnetization ( model a in the terminology of halperin and hohenberg @xcite ) , it is written as @xmath7where @xmath8 is the initial magnetization , @xmath9 @xmath10 prl do zheng is the anomalous dimension of the initial magnetization , @xmath11 and @xmath6 are the known static exponents and @xmath12 is the dynamic one ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath14 are the @xmath15th moments of magnetization , defined by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 indicates an average over several samples randomly initialized but satisfying the condition of having the same magnetization @xmath18 at the beggining .",
    "the relevance of this result is allowing to include the dependence on the initial conditions of the dynamic systems in their non - equilibriun relaxation . as an important consequence , they could advance the existence of a new critical exponent @xmath0 , which is independent of the known set of static exponents and even of the dynamic exponent @xmath12 .    by considering large systems and choosing @xmath19 @xmath20 ; @xmath21 in the equation ( [ jansen_eq ] )",
    ", we obtain the dynamic scaling law for the magnetization : @xmath22expanding @xmath23 around the zero value of the parameter @xmath24 , one obtains : @xmath25which leads to the power law : @xmath26whereas @xmath27 since in this regime @xmath28 .",
    "this new universal stage , characterized by the exponent @xmath29 , has been exhaustively investigated to confirm theoretical predictions and to enlarge our knowledge on phase transitions and critical phenomena .",
    "indeed the anomalous behavior of the magnetization at the beginning of relaxation , also called critical initial slip , was originally associated to a positive value of @xmath0 .",
    "this kind of behavior was confirmed in the kinetic @xmath30 and @xmath31state potts models @xcite , as well as in irreversible models like the majority voter one @xcite and the probabilistic cellular automaton proposed by tom and drugowich de felcio to describe part of the immunological system @xcite .",
    "however , the exponent @xmath0 can also be negative .",
    "this possibility was observed in the blume - capel model ( analytical @xcite and numerically nossopaperphysreve ) and in the baxter - wu model ( numerically drugoarashiro ) , an exactly solvable model which shares with the @xmath32state potts model the same set of critical exponents .",
    "in addition , a negative but close to zero value for @xmath0  was obtained for the two - dimensional ( 2-d ) ising model with three - spin interactions in just one direction ( imtsi ) @xcite , a model which is also known to behave to the @xmath32state potts model universality class .",
    "however , at the best of our knowledge a numerical determination of the exponent @xmath0 for this special case ( @xmath33 ) of the potts model continues to be lacking .",
    "thus , we decided to investigate the short - time behavior of that model in order to better understand its dynamics and also to learn about the role of the exponent @xmath34 of the nonequilibrium magnetization concerning the well established classification of the models ( at least in what concerns the static behavior ) in the universality classes .",
    "as we mentioned above the estimates for the exponent @xmath35 for two models that belong to the same universality class as the 4-state potts model have revealed discrepant results . whereas the two - dimensional ising model with threee spin interactions in one direction ( imtsi ) obeys the conjecture by okano et al .",
    "@xcite(@xmath0 should be negative and close to zero ) @xcite the baxter - wu model @xcite strongly disagrees from that prediction .",
    "putting in numerical values , whereas the imtsi model exhibits a small and negative value @xmath36 for @xmath37 , when studying the bw model we found @xmath38 .",
    "in this paper we study the short - time behavior of the two - dimensional four - state potts model and present numerical estimates for @xmath0 using two different methods .",
    "first , we fix the initial value of the magnetization and follow its time evolution to obtain @xmath39 which in turn can be extrapolated to lead to @xmath0 when @xmath40 .",
    "second , we deal with the time correlation of the magnetization defined by @xcite :    @xmath41    where the average is done over samples whose initial magnetizations are randomly choosen but obey @xmath42 . in reference",
    "@xcite it was shown that this quantity exhibits at @xmath43 the power - law behavior : @xmath44this approach has several advantages when compared to the other technique but its application was initially restricted to the models which exhibit up - down symmetry .",
    "recently , tome @xcite has shown that this result is more general and can be applied whenever the model presents any group of symmetry operations related to the markovian dynamics .",
    "equation [ corr ] was shown to be valid for instance in the antiferromagnet ordering model , models with one absorvent state and even in the baxter - wu model drugoarashiro which exhibits a @xmath45 symmetry .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath46 potts model does not have up - down symmetry .",
    "however , based on the paper of tom @xcite we can use this approach to calculate the exponent @xmath0 of the three- and four - state potts models .",
    "we checked this possibility working with the three - state potts model .",
    "our estimate is @xmath47 , in good agreement with the result obtained by zheng @xcite ( @xmath48 ) and with the estimate obtained by brunstein and tome @xcite using a cellular automaton which exhibits c3v symmetry , the same as the three - state potts model .",
    "a plot of the correlation function of the magnetization @xmath49 in this case is presented in the fig . 1 .    in the sequence we estimated the exponent @xmath0 of the 4-state potts model which agrees with the conjectured by okano et al . in addition , they agree with previous estimates for @xmath0 obtained by simes and drugowich de felcio @xcite .    to confirm our first estimate we simulated the magnetization evolution for four different initial values of @xmath8 which after extrapolated ( @xmath50 ) led to a similar result .",
    "it is clear that having the exponent @xmath0 the anomalous dimension @xmath51 follows . but inspired in previous studies @xcite we decided to investigate a direct manner in determining @xmath34 using mixed initial conditions . in order to build the adequate function",
    "we remember that when in contact with a heat bath at @xmath43 the magnetization of completely ordered samples ( @xmath52 ) decays like a power law    @xmath53    thus , according to the scaling relations ( [ initial slip ] ) and ( magnetization decay ) it is enough to work with the ratio @xmath54to obtain a power law which decays as @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "using @xmath12 as input @xcite we can achieve the value of @xmath34 . on the other hand , by following the relation ( [ magnetization decay ] ) we estimate the ratio @xmath57 which can be compared with the exact result @xmath58 after using the value of the dynamical exponent @xmath12 .",
    "finally using derivatives of the magnetization at an early time and once more the value of @xmath12 as input we obtain the critical exponent @xmath6 of the correlation length , whose numerical estimates by usual techniques ( phenomenological renormalization group , hamiltonian studies and equlibrium monte carlo simulations ) are always very different from the pertinent result ( @xmath59 ) .    the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present a brief review and some details of the simulation .",
    "the results are presented in section 3 and our conclusions are in section 4 .",
    "in time - dependent simulations we are interested in finding power laws for physical quantities even when the system is far from equilibrium . in this regimen the magnetization @xmath61 must be calculated as an average over several samples because the system does not obey any _ a priori _ probability distribution .",
    "the average can be done in different ways : we can prepare all the samples with the same initial magnetization ( sharp preparation ) or generate samples which satisfy a less restrict criteria like to have mean value of the magnetization equal to zero .",
    "the @xmath62 states potts model ferromagnetic without the presence of an external field is defined by the hamiltonian @xcite :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 denotes the interaction between the nearest neighbors @xmath65 and @xmath66 can assume different values @xmath67 .",
    "if two spins are parallel they contribute with energy @xmath68 , else the energy is null .",

    "this kind of simulation is performed @xmath77 times to obtain our final estimates as a function of @xmath74 . in order to prepare a lattice with a given magnetization we need to choose the states @xmath78 in each site with equal probability ( 1/4 ) .",
    "next we measure the magnetization and change states in sites randomly chosen in order to obtain a null value for the magnetization .",
    "finally we change @xmath79 sites occupied by @xmath80 or @xmath81 and substitute by @xmath82 .",
    "the initial magnetization in this case will be given by : @xmath83where @xmath84 .",
    "we have chosen to update the spins according to the heat bath algorithm , which means that the probability that the spin @xmath85 localized at the site @xmath86 can assume another value @xmath87 is given by : @xmath88where @xmath89 denotes the sum about the nearest neighbors sites of the spin at the site @xmath86 .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations for @xmath90 different bins and four different initial magnetizations , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , for a lattice of size @xmath95 .",
    "these magnetizations correspond respectively to @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 according to the expression ( [ initial_magnetization ] ) . to estimate the errors we ran @xmath100 different bins , with @xmath101 samples each one .    in the figs . 2 and 3 we present the log - log plot for two different initial magnetizations and two different values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 respectively",

    "this trend to a negative value can be also certified in the fig .",

    "4 ) but big fluctuations are observed in the evolution of the magnetization in each case.the value found for @xmath109 is @xmath110 is in fair agreement with the result @xcite for the imtsi model and strongly disagrees with the result obtained for the baxter - wu model .",
    "we also ran monte carlo simulations to obtain the time - evolution correlation @xmath49 , and the the dynamic exponent @xmath0 according to the relation ( [ corr ] ) .",
    "for the same interval @xmath106 $ ] we have gotten the estimate @xmath111 @xmath3 that corroborates the above estimate @xmath110 obtained from the evolution of the non - equilibrium magnetization .",
    "we used @xmath112 samples and once more 5 different bins to make this estimate . in figure 5",
    "it is shown the log - log plot of @xmath113 for the four - state potts model .",
    "equilibrium simulations for the four - state potts model are ever acompannied by strong fluctuations .",
    "the reason is the presence in the hamiltonian of a marginal operator characterized by an anomalous dimension equal to zero .",
    "if we hope some signal of that anomalous behavior in short - time simulations done far from equilibrium we should look for that in the only new anomalous dimension : that of the initial magnetization @xmath34 . in order to confirm the null value for the anomalous dimension we estimate directly @xmath34 using the reported function @xmath114 .    over here we used @xmath115 bins for each initial condition and again the @xmath116 realizations . a plot",
