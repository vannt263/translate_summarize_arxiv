    "long - standing interest in modelling effective elastic properties of composites with microstructure has substantially intensified with the emerging possibility of designing periodic structures in air @xcite and in solids @xcite to form phononic crystals and other exotic metamaterials , which open up exciting application prospects ranging from negative index lenses to small scale multiband phononic devices@xcite .",
    "this new prospective brings about the need for fast and accurate computational schemes to test ideas _ in silico_.",
    "the most common numerical tool is the fourier or plane - wave expansion method ( pwe ) .",
    "it is widely used for calculating various spectral parameters including the effective quasistatic speed of sound in acoustic @xcite and elastic qn phononic crystals . at the same time , the pwe calculation is known to face problems when applied to high - contrast composites @xcite , which are of especial interest for applications .",
    "particularly riveting is the case where a soft ingredient is embedded in a way breaking the connectivity of densely packed regions of stiff ingredient . physically speaking ,",
    "the speed of sound , which is large in a homogeneously stiff medium , should fall dramatically when even a small amount of soft component forms a quasi - insulating network. note that this case , which implies a strong effect of multiple interactions , is also ungainly for the multiple - scattering approach @xcite .",
    "the purpose of present letter is to highlight a new method for evaluating the quasistatic effective sound speed @xmath0 in 2d and 3d phononic crystals .",
    "the idea is to recast the wave equation as a 1st - order ordinary differential system ( ods ) with respect to one coordinate ( say @xmath1 ) and to use a monodromy - matrix operator defined as a multiplicative ( or path ) integral in @xmath1 . by this means , we derive a formula for @xmath0 whose essential advantages are an explicit integration in @xmath1 and an exponentially small error of truncation in other coordinate(s ) .",
    "both these features of the analytical result are shown to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of its numerical implementation in comparison with the conventional pwe calculation , which is demonstrated for a 2d steel / epoxy square lattice .",
    "the power of the new approach is especially apparent at high concentration @xmath2 of steel inclusions , where the effective speed @xmath0 displays a steep , near vertical , dependence for @xmath3 , a feature not captured by conventional techniques like pwe .",

    "the difficulty with ( [ 6 ] ) is that it involves the inverse of a partial differential operator @xmath28 .",
    "one solution is to apply a double fourier expansion to @xmath29 and @xmath30 in ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "this leads to the pwe formula for the effective speed@xcite which is expressed via infinite vectors and the inverse of the infinite matrix of fourier coefficients of @xmath11 .",
    "numerical implementation of the pwe formula requires dealing with large dense matrices , especially in the case of high - contrast composites for which the pwe convergence is slow ( see  [ n ] ) .",
    "an alternative `` brute force '' procedure of the scaling approach is to numerically solve the partial differential equation @xmath31 for the @xmath32-periodic function @xmath33 ( e.g. via the boundary integral method@xcite ) .    the new approach proposed here leads to a more efficient formula for @xmath0 based on direct analytical integration in one coordinate direction .",
    "there are two ways of doing so .",
    "the first proceeds from the ods form of the wave equation ( [ 0 ] ) itself , which means skipping ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "this is convenient for deriving @xmath34 in the principal directions @xmath35 see  iib .",
    "the second method is more closely related to the conventional pwe and scaling approaches in that it also starts from ( [ 6 ] ) but treats it differently , namely , the equation @xmath31 is cast in ods form and analytically integrated in one coordinate .",
    "this is basically equivalent to the former method , but enables an easier derivation of the off - diagonal component @xmath36 for the anisotropic case , see  iic .    * b. wave speed in the principal directions . * the wave equation ( 0 ) may be recast as @xmath37where @xmath38 stands for @xmath39 .",

    "there are several ways to use the above analytical results for calculating the effective speed .",

    "apart from this advantage of the mm calculation , it is also seen to be remarkably more stable - with a reasonable fit provided already at @xmath210 .",
    "the difference between the mm and pwe numerical curves is especially notable for the case of densely packed steel rods .",

    "1 can be explained as follows .",
    "the pwe formula@xcite implies calculating @xmath213 with bounded coefficients @xmath214 where @xmath215 are the 2d reciprocal lattice vectors ( we use here that the components of the vector @xmath216 for piecewise constant @xmath11 are of order @xmath217 and that the matrix corresponding to @xmath29 is close to diagonally - dominant and hence its eigenvalues are of order @xmath218 ) . thus the accuracy of the pwe method is expected to be of order @xmath219 in contrast , the accuracy of the mm method , where the 1d fourier expansion is performed inside a multiplicative integral that is close to exponential , is expected to be on the order @xmath220 this can be understood from the mm equation ( [ n3])@xmath171 where the @xmath208 matrix @xmath221 can be replaced by @xmath222 with eigenvalues of order @xmath223 .",
