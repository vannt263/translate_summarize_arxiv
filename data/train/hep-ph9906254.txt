    "one of the most promising future high energy facilities is the recently proposed muon collider . in order to facilitate a decision on whether and how it should be built , all the various uses it can be put to should be assessed .",
    "the highly collimated and intense neutrino beams unavoidably generated by muon decay provide a unique opportunity for precision studies of qcd and electroweak physics .",
    "an excellent example of such investigations is related to the ongoing issue of the validity of the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) expansion for charmonium states and the extraction of the so - called color octet matrix elements .",
    "the fact that heavy quarkonium represents a non - relativistic quantum - mechanical system significantly simplifies its theoretical studies .",
    "in particular , the presence of several important scales in the quarkonium system , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) where @xmath6 is a small parameter ( relative velocity of quarks in the quarkonium state ) allows separation of physical effects occurring at different scales  @xcite .",
    "a large excess of prompt @xmath0 s and @xmath7 s at the tevatron over to the predictions of the color singlet model , i.e. the model which postulates that only quarks in a relative color singlet state can evolve into a charmonium , sparked both experimental and theoretical interest and resulted in the realization of the importance of contributions generated by the operators involving quark states in a relative color octet configuration .",
    "the emerging effective theory ( nrqcd ) , systematically describing these processes , factorizes the charmonium production cross section in the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 are short - distance coefficients containing the perturbatively calculable hard physics of the production of a @xmath10 $ ] system at almost zero relative velocity ( like @xmath11 , etc . ) , expressed as a series in @xmath12 . here",
    ", the index @xmath13 incorporates a spectral decomposition of the quarkonium state in terms of the quantum numbers @xmath14 of the @xmath15 $ ] system , as well as the number of additional derivatives acting on the heavy quark fields .",
    "the essence of nrqcd is to organize the above expansion in powers of the heavy quark velocity @xmath6 within the hadron , and it can be further generalized to include other heavy quarkonium - like systems , such as heavy hybrids  @xcite .",
    "( [ factor ] ) puts all nonperturbative long - distance information into the nrqcd matrix elements , which describe the evolution of the @xmath10 $ ] system into a charmonium plus soft hadrons  a process that can not be calculated at present from first principles .",
    "several attempts have been made to determine these nrqcd matrix elements from various experiments .",
    "the processes involved are sensitive to various linear combinations of nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "the problem is aggravated by the usually very large theoretical uncertainties involved in these calculations ( on the order of @xmath16 ) , due to higher twist effects , uncalculated and/or incalculable higher order perturbative and nonperturbative contributions .",
    "in this situation any independent determination of these quantities should be welcome .",
    "a major advantage of using the neutrino beam is that , at leading order in @xmath17 , the spin structure of the @xmath18 coupling selects a certain combination of octet operators .",
    "the largest contribution is from the one with the quantum numbers  @xmath19 .",
    "of course , order of magnitude measurements of the size of the matrix elements of this operator have already been performed for the @xmath0 and @xmath7 , as well as for the @xmath20 states .",
    "the estimates of these matrix elements mostly come from tevatron fits to hadroproduction cross sections for the @xmath0 and @xmath20 and yield , with large theoretical errors  @xcite , @xmath21 these values are consistent , within a @xmath22 accuracy level , with the value found from @xmath23 decay at lep  @xcite ( the latter does not separate cascade and direct production , so the value of @xmath24 is understandably larger than the one in eq .",
    "( [ estim ] ) ) .",
    "there are , however , large discrepancies between the tevatron fits and the values of @xmath20 matrix elements obtained from b decays  @xcite , and between various determinations of @xmath25 from the tevatron fits .",
    "clearly , new results from hera leptoproduction experiments would not clarify the situation as at leading order the process @xmath26_8(^3s_1)$ ] is forbidden by parity conservation of strong interactions . in this situation",
    "other determinations are welcome and desired .",
    "the present paper is an exploratory investigation of the main features of inclusive charmonium production in @xmath27 collisions . this process parallels @xmath0 leptoproduction , in which case fleming and mehen  @xcite found that the @xmath28 contribution to the total @xmath29 cross section is small compared to the color octet @xmath30 contribution .",
    "a set of cuts , requiring an energetic gluon jet well separated from the @xmath0 , enhances the @xmath28 contributions , but then the color singlet contribution will dominate . these cuts , however ,",
    "leave behind only a small part of the total cross section .",
    "we do nt expect that either the difference in the spin structure or the @xmath31 suppression of neutral current ( nc ) versus charged current ( cc ) events can change this picture , so that we feel justified to calculate only the @xmath30 contributions .",
    "we will find , however , that while the leptoproduction of @xmath0 is not sensitive to the @xmath19 matrix element , and measures one combination of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , measuring the @xmath34 distribution in our process allows for a determination of both the @xmath19 and the @xmath33 matrix elements .",
    "the difference is due to a difference in the spin structure of the @xmath23 and photon couplings .",
    "the relative size of the @xmath19 and the @xmath33 contributions to the differential cross sections turns out to change drastically around @xmath35 .",
    "this fact and the less steep decrease of the differential cross section ( compared to leptoproduction ) together allow an easy separation of the two contributing matrix elements .",
    "we will find that the hard process at small @xmath34 favors the @xmath36 contribution by a significant factor . in an experiment which can not easily separate direct @xmath0 production from a @xmath20 cascading down to a @xmath0 ( such is the situation at lep , for example ) , these cascades enhance the observed cross section by a significant amount .",
    "in particular , given the estimates of eq .",
    "( [ estim ] ) , we find @xmath37 ! noting that @xmath38 we conclude that @xmath0 production via this cascade mechanism is of the same order of magnitude as via the direct route .",
    "it is however easy to include the effect of these unresolved cascades into the formalism by simply replacing the actual @xmath39 matrix element with a @xmath40 which takes into account this cascade factor  @xcite .",
    "the rate of @xmath20 production can then easily be related to our @xmath19 contribution to the @xmath0 production rate , because in that case there are no other competing matrix elements .",
    "the large number of events expected at the muon collider will certainly allow to study the entire spectrum of charmonium states .",
    "due to the fact that the dominant @xmath32 matrix element of the @xmath41 and the dominant @xmath19 of the @xmath20 are related by heavy quark symmetry , our results can be trivially translated to a prediction of these rates .",
    "the only relevant matrix element above is measurable in any other cascade @xmath0 production process .    in the present study",
    "we also discuss what we can learn about these matrix elements at existing neutrino facilities .",
    "as we show below , the mere event of the detection of charmonium states in current experiments ( nomad or nutev ) would imply the presence of the color - octet structures predicted by the nrqcd factorization formalism .",
    "the main question to be addressed here is the smallness of the event number .",
    "since the detectors used in current neutrino experiments are optimized for the observation of neutrino - related phenomena ( such as neutrino oscillations ) and not for charmonium detection , we shall concentrate on @xmath0 production , which has the cleanest experimental signature of all charmonium states .",
    "however cascade processes should also be included , helping to increase the event number .",
    "we will find that both at nomad and nutev , the event rate is on the verge of observability .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : calc ] we explain the velocity scaling of the nrqcd matrix elements that we use and provide analytical formulas for the structure functions  @xmath9 .",
    "we discuss the numerical results for the muon collider , nomad and nutev in detail in sec .",

    "at leading order , @xmath30 , only neutral current @xmath42 interactions contribute to charmonium production and fig .",
    "[ fig : leadinggraphs ] shows the relevant feynman diagrams . at @xmath28 ,",
    "in addition to the color singlet contribution , one may expect some enhancement from charged current interactions due to the difference in the couplings and the propagators , but we do not expect that this could drastically change the cross section to invalidate our order - of - magnitude estimates .    before proceeding with the calculation ,",
    "let us briefly review the velocity counting rules of the charmonium production matrix elements which will be used below .",
    "the charmonium production matrix elements are defined in nrqcd as @xmath43 where the operators @xmath44 are bilinear in the heavy quark fields .",
    "( @xmath45 is the charmonium spin @xmath46-component . )",
    "each matrix element is proportional to a power of the relative velocity  @xmath6 of the heavy quarks .",
    "each spatial derivative acting on a heavy quark field introduces one power of  @xmath6 .",
    "the nonperturbative evolution of the @xmath47 system proceeds through multipole radiation of soft gluons , which introduce additional powers of the velocity . for the @xmath0 and @xmath7 ,",
    "the leading matrix element is at @xmath48 , @xmath49 which clearly selects the dominant fock state .",
    "we observe , however , that this matrix element corresponds to a @xmath47 system in a color singlet state , which can be produced only at subleading order , @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , its contribution will be smaller than that of the velocity - subleading color octet configuration , such as @xmath51 t^a \\psi | j/\\psi + x \\rangle\\ , \\langle j/\\psi + x | \\psi^\\dagger \\left [ -\\frac{i}{2 } { d^ { \\ { i } \\sigma^{k \\ } } } \\right ] t^a \\chi | 0 \\rangle , \\nonumber \\\\ \\langle 0 | { \\cal o}^{j/\\psi}_8(^1p_0 ) | 0 \\rangle & = & \\langle 0 | \\chi^\\dagger \\left [ -\\frac{i}{2}\\ , { \\bf d } \\right ] t^a \\psi |j/\\psi   + x \\rangle\\ , \\langle j/\\psi + x | \\psi^\\dagger \\left [ -\\frac{i}{2 } { \\bf d } \\right ] t^a \\chi | 0 \\rangle , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 represents scalar , vector or traceless symmetric tensor contraction of indices .",
    "five of these configurations , namely those with the quantum numbers @xmath32 , @xmath19 , @xmath33 for @xmath53 , scale as @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath55 matrix element is negligible , of the order @xmath56 , and will be neglected hereafter .    in the case of the p - wave states",
    "@xmath20 we encounter a similar situation .",
    "the leading matrix elements are again suppressed by one factor of @xmath17 , and are color singlets at @xmath57 .",
    "they project out the dominant p - wave @xmath58 combination @xmath59 \\psi |\\chi_{c0 }   + x \\rangle\\ , \\langle \\chi_{c0 } + x | \\psi^\\dagger \\left [ -\\frac{i}{2 } { \\bf d \\cdot \\sigma } \\right ] \\chi | 0 \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ \\langle 0 | { \\cal o}^{\\chi_{c1}}_1(^3p_1 ) | 0 \\rangle & = & \\frac{1}{2 } \\langle 0 | \\chi^\\dagger \\left [ -\\frac{i}{2 } { \\bf d \\times \\sigma } \\right ] \\psi |\\chi_{c1 }   + x \\rangle\\ , \\langle \\chi_{c1 } + x | \\psi^\\dagger \\left [ -\\frac{i}{2 } { \\bf d \\times \\sigma } \\right ] \\chi | 0 \\rangle \\\\ \\langle 0 | { \\cal o}^{\\chi_{c2}}_1(^3p_2 ) | 0 \\rangle & = & \\langle 0 | \\chi^\\dagger \\left [ -\\frac{i}{2 } { d^{(i } \\sigma^{k ) } } \\right ] \\psi |\\chi_{c2 }   + x \\rangle\\ , \\langle \\chi_{c2 } + x | \\psi^\\dagger \\left [ -\\frac{i}{2 } { d^{(i } \\sigma^{k ) } } \\right ] \\chi | 0 \\rangle .",

    "indeed , we expect @xmath187 ( recall that in @xmath0 leptoproduction the color singlet contribution was suppressed by  @xmath188 . ) as a consequence , our tree level calculation is unable to accurately predict the dominant @xmath189 production rate . however , because all numerical factors in the color octet contribution are smaller for the @xmath189 than for the @xmath0 ( including the size of the phase space ) , we can at least exclude the possibility of @xmath189 production at presently running experiments . in order to make a meaningful estimate for the muon collider",
    ", one needs to perform much more involved @xmath28 calculations .    to summarize , we have investigated charmonium production at some of the currently running ( nomad and nutev ) and proposed ( first muon collider ) neutrino factories .",
    "we found that the @xmath0 production cross section is dominated by the contribution from the matrix element of the color octet @xmath36 operator , which is not accessible in photo and leptoproduction experiments .",
    "our exploratory study shows that the neutrino beam from the @xmath151 collider can be successfully used to accurately extract the color octet @xmath19 and @xmath33 matrix elements of the @xmath0 .",
    "this measurement is complementary to leptoproduction , where @xmath190 and @xmath191 contribute . in order to achieve an accurate extraction",
    ", however , a detailed investigation is necessary , including the @xmath28 contributions .",
    "a significant deviation of the measured values of the nonperturbative charmonium matrix elements extracted from high energy @xmath192 and @xmath193 experiments could be a sign of intrinsic charm in the proton .",
    "we would like to thank sean fleming , tom mehen and adam falk for useful discussions .",
