    "<S> the question of whether one should speak of a  pairing glue \" in the hubbard and @xmath0-@xmath1 models is basically a question about the dynamics of the pairing interaction . </S>",
    "<S> if the dynamics of the pairing interaction arises from virtual states , whose energies correspond to the mott gap , and give rise to the exchange coupling @xmath1 , the interaction is instantaneous on the relative time scales of interest . in this case , while one might speak of an  instantaneous glue \" , this interaction differs from the traditional picture of a retarded pairing interaction . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the energies correspond to the spectrum seen in the dynamic spin susceptibility , then the interaction is retarded and one speaks of a spin - fluctuation glue which mediates the d - wave pairing . </S>",
    "<S> here we present results from numerical studies which provide insight into this question .    </S>",
    "<S> the question of whether the pairing interaction in the cuprate superconductors should be characterized as arising from a  pairing glue \" has recently been raised@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as we will discuss , this is a question about the dynamics of the pairing interaction and it will be answered when we know more about the frequency dependence of the cuprate superconducting gap . from the d - wave ( @xmath2 ) momentum dependence of the cuprate gap , we know that the pairing interaction is spatially a short range , dominantly near - neighbor attraction . however , in spite of pioneering arpes@xcite , tunneling@xcite and infrared conductivity@xcite studies , we do not yet have sufficient information to definitively characterize its dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> thus , while there is a growing consensus that superconductivity in the high @xmath3 cuprates arises from strong short - range coulomb interactions between electrons rather than the traditional electron - phonon interaction , the precise nature of the pairing interaction remains controversial .    </S>",
    "<S> this is the case even among those who agree that the essential physics of the cuprates is contained in the hubbard and @xmath0-@xmath1 models . </S>",
    "<S> for example , both anderson s resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) theory@xcite and the spin - fluctuation exchange theory@xcite lead to a short - range interaction which forms @xmath4 pairs . </S>",
    "<S> however , the dynamics of the two interactions differ . in the rvb picture , </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting phase is envisioned as arising out of a mott - liquid of singlet pairs . </S>",
    "<S> these pairs are bound by a superexchange interaction @xmath1 which is proportional to @xmath5 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is the effective hopping matrix element between adjacent sites and @xmath6 is an onsite coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 is determined by the virtual hopping of an electron of a given spin to an adjacent site containing an electron with an opposite spin.@xcite thus the dynamics of @xmath1 involves virtual excitations above the mott gap which is set by @xmath6 , and the pairing interaction is essentially instantaneous . in this case , as anderson has noted,@xcite one should not speak of a  pairing glue \" in the same sense that this term is used when referring to a phonon mediated interaction . in the spin - fluctuation exchange picture , </S>",
    "<S> the pairing is viewed as arising from the exchange of particle - hole spin fluctuations whose dynamics reflect the frequency spectrum seen in inelastic magnetic neutron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this spectrum covers an energy range which is small compared with @xmath6 or the bare bandwidth @xmath7 . in this case , the pairing interaction is retarded and in analogy to the traditional phonon mediated pairing , one says that the spin - fluctuations provide the  pairing glue . \" </S>",
    "<S> so the question of whether there is a  pairing glue \" offers a way of distinguishing different pairing mechanisms . here using numerical techniques we examine this question for the @xmath0-@xmath1 and hubbard models .    in the superconducting state </S>",
    "<S> the nambu self - energy @xmath8 can be parametrized as @xmath9 here , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the pauli spin matrices and @xmath13 and @xmath14 describe the so - called normal components of the self - energy and the gap function @xmath15 describes the anomalous part which contains information on the internal structure of the pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the complex gap function @xmath16 satisfies the cauchy relation @xmath17 and for @xmath18 , one has @xmath19 based upon this , a useful measure of the frequency dependence of the pairing interaction@xcite is @xmath20    it gives the fraction of the zero frequency gap function which arises from frequencies below @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htb ]   versus @xmath22 ( solid curve ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) the pairing interaction spectral weight @xmath28 versus @xmath21 for pb . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 increases as @xmath21 passes through @xmath29 and @xmath30 reflecting the transverse and longitudinal phonon contributions to the pairing . at larger values of @xmath21 , @xmath28 exceeds unity because @xmath31 is reduced from the value it would have just due to the phonons by the presence of the non - retarded screened coulomb pseudo - potential @xmath32.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    in order to obtain some insight into @xmath33 , we first consider the case of pb . here </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath34 dependence of the gap function is negligible and only the frequency dependence enters . </S>",

    "<S> we have evaluated @xmath28 . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) , @xmath28 increases as @xmath21 passes through the characteristic transverse and longitudinal pb phonon frequencies plus @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> it then exhibits a broad maximum and settles down to a value that exceeds 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum arises from the change in sign of @xmath23 which occurs at a frequency 2 to 3 times the characteristic frequencies of the retarded part of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the reason that the asymptotic value of @xmath28 exceeds unity is that the non - retarded screened coulomb pseudopotential leads to a negative , frequency independent , contribution @xmath36 to the real part of @xmath37 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the cauchy relation eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:3 ] becomes @xmath38 and at high frequencies @xmath28 exceeds 1 by the non - retarded contribution @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> the models that we will consider have a square two - dimensional lattice with a near neighbor one electron hopping @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the hubbard model has an onsite coulomb interaction @xmath6 and its hamiltonian is @xmath40 with @xmath41 a chemical potential which sets the site filling @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath43 creates an electron of spin @xmath44 on site @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the site occupation number operator for spin @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is the large @xmath6 limit of the hubbard model in which no double site occupancy is allowed and near neighbor spins are coupled by an exchange interaction @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 here @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a projected fermion operator defined as @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> exact diagonalization calculations were carried out for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model on a square cluster of @xmath51 sites . </S>",
    "<S> this particular cluster exhibits the full local symmetries of the underlying square lattice and has all of the most symmetric @xmath34 points in reciprocal space . here </S>",
    "<S> we will consider the 0- , 1- and 2-hole sectors . </S>",
    "<S> one hole doped on to a 32-site cluster corresponds to a doping @xmath52 .    </S>",

    "<S> we believe that finite size effects are responsible for @xmath68 starting out negatively and that the corresponding negative dip in @xmath33 is an artifact . for @xmath63 , the rapid increase in @xmath33 as @xmath65 exceeds @xmath69 </S>",
    "<S> reflects the dynamic contributions of the spin - fluctuations and the broad maximum arises from the negative swing in @xmath68 which occurs when @xmath22 exceeds several times their spectral range . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the behavior seen in pb when @xmath22 exceeds the spectral range of @xmath26 . at higher frequencies in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4]b , @xmath28 is seen to decrease below 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this high frequency behavior in which @xmath28 drops below 1 is more clearly seen for @xmath66 , as shown by the dashed curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4]b . the fact that at high frequency @xmath70 lays below 1 means that there is a non - retarded ( instantaneous ) contribution to the @xmath71-wave pairing interaction . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the case of the traditional low temperature superconductors , here the non - retarded contribution increases the pairing , corresponding to a positive value of @xmath72 </S>",
    "<S> . furthermore its relative contribution increases as @xmath73 increases .    for the hubbard model </S>",
    "<S> , one can explore the full dynamic range including the upper hubbard band so that the cauchy relation does not have an additional constant term @xmath36 . to calculate @xmath15 for the hubbard model we have used a dynamic cluster approximation@xcite ( dca ) . </S>",
    "<S> the general idea of the dca is to approximate the effects of correlations in the bulk lattice with those on a finite size cluster with @xmath74 sites and periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the dca maps the bulk ( @xmath75 with @xmath76 ) lattice problem onto an effective periodic cluster embedded in a self - consistent dynamic mean - field that is designed to represent the remaining degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the hybridization of the cluster to the host accounts for fluctuations arising from coupling between the cluster and the rest of the system . </S>",
    "<S> here we have used a non - crossing approximation@xcite ( nca ) to determine @xmath77 for a 4-site @xmath78 cluster at a wave vector @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this cluster allows for a gap with @xmath71-wave symmetry and is such that within the non - crossing approximation dynamic results can be obtained on the real frequency axis . </S>",
    "<S> similar calculations were performed for the t - j model in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in mean - field theories such as the dca </S>",
    "<S> , the mean - field generates a constant real term @xmath80 . in the infinite cluster size limit </S>",
    "<S> , the dca recovers the exact result and the mean - field contribution @xmath80 vanishes . for a finite cluster size </S>",
    "<S> , we therefore view this contribution as an artifact and subtract it off of @xmath81 before performing the analysis based on the cauchy relation . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath80 was determined from @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for @xmath28 becomes @xmath83    results showing @xmath84 versus @xmath21 for a filling @xmath85 and @xmath86 are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:5]a . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath71-wave projection of the dynamic spin susceptibility    [ htb ]   versus @xmath65 for the @xmath78 dca - nca hubbard calculation with @xmath86 , @xmath85 and @xmath87 . here </S>",

    "<S> these calculations are for a reduced temperature @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> once @xmath91 , the @xmath11 component of the nambu self - energy gives @xmath77 and one can calculate @xmath84 . </S>",

    "<S> then however , on a higher energy scale @xmath84 goes to 1 . </S>",
    "<S> similar results for @xmath84 for different values of @xmath94 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4]a . here </S>",
    "<S> one sees that as @xmath94 increases , the region over which @xmath84 remains below 1 extends to higher energies . for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model </S>",
    "<S> this energy was pushed to infinity , but for the hubbard model the high frequency contribution that takes @xmath84 to 1 is associated with the upper hubbard band as seen from the single - particle density of states shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4]b .    </S>",
    "<S> these numerical results show that the @xmath71-wave pairing interaction in the @xmath0-@xmath1 and hubbard models contain both retarded and non - retarded contributions.@xcite the retarded contribution occurs on an energy scale which is small compared to the bare bandwidth @xmath7 and the onsite coulomb interaction @xmath6 . for the hubbard model , </S>",

    "<S> this energy scale is pushed to infinity and the exchange contribution is instantaneous .    </S>",
    "<S> a simple phenomenological form for the @xmath71-wave pairing interaction , consistent with these observations is @xmath98 here @xmath99 is the dynamic spin susceptibility and @xmath100 and @xmath101 are effective coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> the retarded contribution to the pairing comes from the first term , and the non - retarded contribution from the second , exchange , term . unlike the traditional low @xmath3 case where the non - retarded screened coulomb interaction suppresses the gap , here the non - retarded exchange term enhances the @xmath71-wave gap .    </S>",
    "<S> the question regarding whether there is a  pairing glue \" is then a question of whether the dominant contribution to @xmath102 comes from the integral of @xmath103.@xcite from the results presented here we conclude that both the @xmath0-@xmath1 and hubbard models have spin - fluctuation  pairing glue \" . </S>",
    "<S> however , they also exhibit a smaller , non - retarded contribution . for the cuprate materials , </S>",
    "<S> the relative weight of the retarded and non - retarded contributions to the pairing interaction remains an open question . </S>",
