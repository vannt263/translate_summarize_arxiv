    "complex networks @xcite have been used to model the real complex systems with a large number of interacting individuals , such as internet @xcite , world trade web @xcite , metabolic networks @xcite , coauthor networks @xcite , and so on .",
    "the individuals in complex systems are denoted by nodes in complex networks , and the interactions between individuals are denoted by edges between nodes .",
    "for example , in a collaboration network , the scientists can be regarded as nodes and their joint papers can be treated as edges . from this collaboration network",
    ", we can find the collaborative relationship between any two scientists .",
    "however , many papers have more than two coauthors .",
    "therefore , the collaborative relationship among any three or more scientists can not be described in the above simple collaboration network .",
    "then , what kind of networks can solve this problem is an interesting issue , and the complex hyper - networks corresponding to hyper - graphs emerge in this context .    in complex networks ,",
    "an edge connects only two nodes , however , an hyper - edge of complex hyper - networks can contain more than two nodes , which can describe the multifaceted collaborative relationship appropriately .",
    "though a hyper - edge can connect an arbitrary number of nodes , it is often useful to study hyper - networks where each hyper - edge connects the same number of nodes : a @xmath0-uniform hyper - complex is a hyper - network in which each hyper - edge connects exactly @xmath0 nodes .",
    "there has been a growing interest in the research of hyper - networks [ 10 - 14 ] recently .",
    "for example , in virtual enterprises , to respond to market changes rapidly and exploit unexpected business opportunities efficiently , the virtual breeding environment ( vbe ) actors collaborate , and share competencies , skills as well as resources @xcite . in order to describe the relationship among vbe actors , a hyper - graph ( a hyper - network )",
    "is proposed as a meaningful logical structure , in which a hyper - path ( i.e. , a hyper - edge ) represents the structure underlying a minimal cluster of enterprises . by the hyper - graph model ,",
    "the formation process of a virtual enterprise can be presented and the pre - identified business opportunity may be caught .",
    "recently , an evolving hyper - network model is introduced to describe real - life systems with the hyper - network characteristics @xcite .",
    "two evolving mechanisms with respect to a hyper - degree , namely hyper - edge growth and preferential attachment , are proposed to construct the hyper - network mode .",
    "the hyper - degree is defined as the number of the hyper - edge attached to that node . in this paper ,",
    "a different evolving @xmath0-uniform hyper - network model is introduced , whose evolving mechanism involves the joint degree of @xmath1 nodes , which is defined as the number of the hyper - edges attached to the @xmath1 nodes .",
    "on the other hand , synchronization as a typical collective dynamical behavior of complex networks has drawn considerable attentions recently [ 15 - 27 ] . however",
    ", less attention has been paid to synchronization of complex hyper - networks .",
    "thus in this paper , synchronization of the 3-uniform hyper - network will be investigated for the first time .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "an evolving hyper - network model is introduced and several topological characteristics are studied . in section 3 ,",
    "synchronization of a 3-uniform hyper - network is investigated and several synchronization criteria are obtained . in section 4 ,",
    "several numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of derived results .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "an evolving mechanism with respect to joint degree to construct the @xmath0-uniform hyper - network model is proposed in this section . in the scale - free network model put forward by barabsi and albert @xcite , two simple evolving mechanisms , i.e. , growth and preferential attachment ,",
    "are proposed to construct the network model .",
    "inspired by @xcite , the following generation algorithm are proposed to construct the @xmath0-uniform hyper - network model :    \\(1 ) growth : the hyper - network starting with @xmath2 nodes , at every time step , we add one node and @xmath3 hyper - edges to the existing hyper - network , where @xmath4 .",
    "\\(2 ) preferential attachment : the probability @xmath5of a new hyper - edge contains the new node and selected @xmath1 nodes in the existing hyper - network depends on the joint degree of the @xmath1 nodes at time @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 denotes the joint degree of nodes @xmath8 , which is defined as the number of hyper - edges containing nodes @xmath8 , then @xmath9 where @xmath10 .    then , after @xmath6 time steps , this constructs a @xmath0-uniform hyper - network with @xmath11 nodes and @xmath12 hyper - edges .",
    "define the hyper - degree @xmath13 of node @xmath14 as the number of the hyper - edges containing node @xmath14 and node - node distance as the number of the hyper - edges in the shortest paths between two nodes . according to the generation algorithm and",
    "the relation between hyper - degree and joint degree , when a new node enter into the hyper - network , the probability of node @xmath14 with hyper - degree @xmath13 acquires a hyper - edge is    @xmath15    let @xmath14 be the new node added to the hyper - network at time @xmath16 , and @xmath17 be the probability that node @xmath14 has hyper - degree @xmath13 when it is being picked up at time @xmath18 .",
    "suppose that @xmath13 is a continuous variable , then probability @xmath19 can be viewed as a continuous rate of change of @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a constant and denotes the rate of change of @xmath13 .",
    "since the new node @xmath14 brings in @xmath3 new hyper - edges , which has hyper - degree @xmath3 at time @xmath16 , so the change of hyper - degree at @xmath16 is @xmath22 . solving equation ( [ eq5 ] ) with initial condition @xmath23 , one has @xmath24 and @xmath25 assuming that the time variables @xmath16 have a uniform distribution with @xmath26 , i.e.",

    "table i shows the average path length of the 3-uniform hyper - network models with @xmath31 and different pair of @xmath6 and @xmath3 , which exhibits small world property .     versus node hyper - degree @xmath34 on a logarithmic scale with the different parameters .",
