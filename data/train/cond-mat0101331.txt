    "two - dimensional hydrogen atoms in magnetic fields have been a subject of active research during the last years .",
    "a large body of articles has been published on this problem in the framework of non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "this problem is of practical interest because of the technological advances in nanofabrication technology that have made possible to create low dimensional structures like quantum wells , quantum wires and quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional hamiltonian describing the coulomb interaction @xmath1 , between a conduction electron and donor impurity center when a constant magnetic @xmath2 field is applied perpendicular to the plane of motion , can be written in atomic units , @xmath3 in the cgs system , as follows @xmath4 since we are dealing with a two - dimensional problem , we choose to work in polar coordinates @xmath5 the angular operator operator @xmath6 commutes with the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) , consequently we can introduce the following ansatz for the eigenfunction @xmath7 substituting ( [ 2 ] ) into ( [ 1 ] ) , we readily obtain that the radial function @xmath8 satisfies the second order differential equation    @xmath9 u(r)=0,\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the larmor frequency , @xmath11 is the energy , and @xmath12 the eigenvalue of the angular momentum .",
    "( [ ecua ] ) can not be solved in closed form in terms of special functions @xcite .",
    "there are analytic expressions for the energy for particular values of @xmath13 and @xmath12@xcite .",
    "the computation of the energy eigenvalues in ( [ ecua ] ) has been carried out using different techniques @xcite .",
    "a less studied problem is that of a relativistic 2d hydrogen atom in a magnetic field .",
    "perhaps relativistic effects are not very important in semi - conducting devices but nevertheless they can not be neglected when the interacting potentials are strong @xcite .",
    "recently , the importance of considering relativistic effects has been pointed out when one computes the energy levels of semiconductors in high magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "the effective mass method is still valid until @xmath14 oe . in the case of two band approximation , the dispersion law has the form of a klein - gordon energy spectrum@xcite .",
    "also , relativistic invariance imposes some supplementary restrictions on the allowed quantum energy levels .    in this article",
    "we investigate the relativistic corrections to the energy spectrum of a two - dimensional hydrogen atom in an homogeneous transverse magnetic field . using a mixed - basis variational approach @xcite . in sec 2 ,",
    "we compute the relativistic energy spectrum of a 2d relativistic klein - gordon hydrogen atom . in sec 3",
    ", we discuss the application of the @xmath15 expansion to our problem . in sec 4",
    ", we compare the energy spectrum of the relativistic 2d hydrogen atom with that obtained in the nonrelativistic limit",
    ". finally , we present the concluding remarks in sec . 5 .",
    "since we are interested in discussing the relativistic corrections to the energy levels of the 2d hydrogen atom , we proceed to solve the 2d klein - gordon equation .",
    "the results obtained after solving the klein - gordon equation apply to an electron without spin .",
    "the advantage of this approach @xcite can be easily understood if we recall that the schdinger equation does not take into account the spin of the electron ( [ 1 ] ) and then we can directly compare the relativistic and nonrelativistic energy spectra .",
    "the covariant generalization of the klein - gordon equation in the presence of electromagnetic interactions takes the form @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the contravariant metric tensor , and @xmath18 is the covariant derivative .",
    "the metric tensor @xmath19 written in polar coordinates @xmath20 takes the form : @xmath21 and the vector potential @xmath22 associated with a 2d coulomb potential and a constant magnetic field interaction is    @xmath23    from the above expression ( [ 5 ] ) for the vector potential @xmath22 it is straightforward to verify that the electric and magnetic fields satisfy the invariant relations @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ( 2 + 1 ) electromagnetic field strength tensor .",
    "expressions ( [ seis ] ) and ( [ siete ] ) tell us that in fact , @xmath27 is associated with a 2d coulomb atom in a constant magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the particle motion .",
    "the corresponding @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be written in polar coordinates as follows : @xmath30 since the vector potential components do not depend on time or the angular variable @xmath31 we have that the wave function @xmath32 , solution of the klein - gordon equation ( [ 3 ] ) , can be written as    @xmath33    where the function @xmath8 satisfies the second order differential equation    @xmath34    eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) has the same form as eq .",
    "( [ ecua ] ) , therefore no exact solutions of eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) can be obtained in terms of special functions .    in the present article",
    "we analyze the problem of computing the energy levels of the 2d relativistic coulomb atom using a mixed - basis variational approach . in order to apply the variational method to our problem @xcite",
    ", we look for a trial wave function . since eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) reduces to the relativistic hydrogen atom equation when @xmath35 we can consider as a basis , for @xmath36 , the hydrogen wave functions @xmath37 the solution of eq .",
    "( [ ecua ] ) when @xmath38 is    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is a normalization constant , @xmath41 are the laguerre polynomials @xcite , and @xmath11 from @xcite is @xmath42 ^{-1/2}.\\ ] ] it is worth mentioning that the relation ( [ 8 ] ) makes sense only when @xmath43 a condition that forbids the existence of the @xmath0 energy levels ( @xmath44 , this is in fact a peculiarity of the relativistic klein - gordon solution , which is not present in the standard schrdinger framework .",
    "conversely , for large values of @xmath45 a good trial basis is that of the spherical oscillator . in this case , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) has the form @xmath46 and , in the high - field limit , the energy spectrum of a relativistic spinless particle in a constant magnetic field satisfies the relation    @xmath47    among the advantages of considering a relativistic spinless electron is that we can easily compute the energy levels with the help of the mixed base variational approach .",
    "nevertheless , we can easily see when the klein gordon equation gives a reasonably good value for the energy spectrum as compared to that obtained via the dirac equation .",
    "the 2 + 1 dirac equation @xcite in the presence of an external electromagnetic field @xmath48 reads @xmath49 since we are working in a two dimensional space , we can work in the following representation of the gamma matrices @xmath50 then , the dirac spinor has only two components . since the dirac equation ( [ dirac ] ) expressed in the diagonal tetrad gauge commutes with the operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the spinor @xmath53 can be written as @xmath54    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 satisfy the system of equations @xmath58 @xmath59 substituting ( [ eq1 ] ) into ( [ eq2 ] ) , we obtain the following second order differential equation @xmath60 where @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 it is worth mentioning that angular parameter @xmath63 takes half integer values @xcite and therefore it can be related to @xmath12 as follows @xmath64    eq . ( [ seg ] ) reduces to the radial klein - gordon equation ( [ 7 ] ) when @xmath61 vanishes . looking at ( [ d ] ) and ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "we see that @xmath61 is very small for large values of @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the mean square radius of the dirac and klein - gordon electron is @xmath66 where @xmath67 labels the energy levels . taking into account that",
    "large values of the radial variable imply that @xmath68 , we find that @xmath61 is negligible for magnetic fields satisfying the inequality @xmath69 , which is the critical value for strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "( [ seg ] ) , and keeping only leading terms of @xmath61 , the motion of a relativistic electron for small values of @xmath70 and @xmath65 is described by the equation @xmath71 notice that eq ( [ weak ] ) gives a description of a relativistic electron in a weak magnetic field @xmath70 for small values of @xmath65 . from eq .",
    "( [ seg ] ) and ( [ ele ] , we see that , in oposition to the klein - gordon case , the 2 + 1 relativistic dirac electron has @xmath0 states .",
    "if we attempt to apply the variational method using the hydrogen atom basis , we will obtain good agreement with accurate results for small values of @xmath72 but this approach fails for large @xmath73 , even if we consider a many term basis .",
    "an analogous situation occurs when we use the oscillator basis , in which case we obtain a good agreement for large @xmath74 but the convergence is very slow for small values of @xmath75 .",
    "@xcite in order to solve this problem , we propose a trial function @xcite , for any quantum level @xmath67 , a linear combination of the form    @xmath76    where @xmath77 ; @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the corresponding hydrogen and oscillator wave functions associated with the quantum level @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 are constants to be calculated .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our basis is not orthogonal under the inner product @xmath83 substituting ( [ mixed ] ) into ( [ 7 ] ) , and performing variation on the basis coefficients @xmath84 , we readily obtain the following matrix equation : @xmath85 with @xmath86 where the indices i and j running from 1 to n correspond to the hydrogen and oscillator bases respectively . the algebraic equation ( [ matriz ] )",
    "@xmath87 gives nontrivial values of @xmath84 provided that the matrix @xmath88 be singular .",
    "the energy eigenvalue for a given quantum level @xmath67 is the lowest value of @xmath89 solution of the equation @xmath90 the mixed - basis variational method gives reasonably good values for the energy eigenvalues even for the simple selection of a two term basis as in eq .",
    "( [ mixed ] ) . in this particular case , we have that the trial function , for any quantum level , is a linear combination of the form    @xmath91    better results should be expected for a basis with more terms . for a three term basis , we have two possible trial functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 where the three terms in ( [ mix21 ] ) and ( [ mix12 ] ) have the same angular dependences of the eigenfunction to be approximated . in this scheme",
    "u@xmath94 corresponds to a wavefunction associated with a higher quantum number to that we are going to approximate .    for comparison ,",
    "the numerical computations of the relativistic energy spectra are carried out with the help of the schwartz method @xcite , which is a generalization of the mesh point technique for numerical approximation of functions .",
    "this method gives highly accurate results given a thoughtful choice of the reference function , and its efficiency has been shown computing the energy spectrum of the 2d hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "the shifted 1/n expansion is a perturbative technique that has permitted us to solve the n - dimensional stationary schrdinger equation with a wide class of radial potentials .",
    "the shifted 1/n method has also been developed to compute energy eigenvalues of relativistic spin 0 and spin @xmath95 particles in the presence of spherically symmetric vector and scalar potentials . here",
    "we proceed to compute the energy eigenvalues of our problem using the 1/n expansion for @xmath96 .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) contains a magnetic field contribution , some minor modifications should be made to the recipe of ref @xcite where the authors develop the shifted 1/n technique to deal with the @xmath97 klein - gordon equation in a spherically symmetric potential .",

    "in this section we proceed to compare the results obtained for the energy spectrum of the 2d relativistic hydrogen atom with those computed in the nonrelativistic limit , when the 2d schrdinger equation was considered . in order to establish a better comparison we use numerical results obtained with the schwartz interpolation method@xcite . in tables 1 and 2",
    "we exhibit different values of the energy for different magnetic field strengths .    [ cols= \" < , < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]     tables 1 and 2 show that the role played by the relativistic corrections is to shift down the energy levels .",

    "the advantage of the mixed variational method is that we obtain a simple form of the wave function and a reasonable good approximation without considering a large term variational basis .",
    "the role played by relativity consists in shifting down the energy levels as indicated in figure 5 .",
