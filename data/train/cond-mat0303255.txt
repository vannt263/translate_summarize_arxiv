    "khintchine @xcite revealed the deep relation between the gaussian central limit theorem and classical boltzmann gibbs statistics . from a simple stochastic point of view",
    ", we may see this relation by considering the velocity of a brownian particle . the most basic phenomenological dynamical description of brownian motion , is in terms of the langevin equation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a _",
    "gaussian _ white noise term .",
    "usually the assumption of gaussian noise is imposed on the langevin equation to obtain a maxwellian velocity distribution describing the equilibrium of the brownian particle .",
    "we may reverse our thinking of the problem , the gaussian noise is naturally expected based on central limit theorem arguments , and the latter leads to maxwell s equilibrium .",
    "similar arguments hold for a brownian particle in an external time independent binding force field , the maxwell  boltzmann equilibrium is obtained in the long time limit only if the noise term is gaussian .",
    "yet another case where the relation between gaussian statistics and statistical mechanics is seen is feynman s gaussian path integral formulation of statistical mechanics .    however , gaussian central limit theorem is non unique .",
    "lvy , and khintchine @xcite have generalized the gaussian central limit theorem , to the case of summation of independent , identically distributed random variables described by long tailed distributions . in this case",
    "lvy distributions replace the gaussian in generalized limit theorems .",
    "hence it is natural to ask @xcite if a lvy based statistical mechanics exist ? and if so what is its physical domain and its relation to thermodynamics .",
    "this type of questions are timely due to the interest in generalizations of statistical mechanics @xcite , mainly non - extensive statistical mechanics due to tsallis @xcite .",
    "while lvy statistics is used in many applications @xcite , its _",
    "possible _ relation to generalized equilibrium statistical mechanics is still unclear .",
    "as well known , boltzmann used a kinetic approach for a dilute gas of particles to derive maxwell s velocity distribution , his starting point being his non - linear equation ( see conditions in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the kinetic approach can be used as a tool to derive equilibrium , starting from non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "ernst @xcite , shows how the maxwell equilibrium is obtained from several stochastic collision models .",
    "more recently , chernov and lebowitz @xcite investigated numerically a gas @xmath8 heavy piston system , showing that the gas particle velocity distribution approaches a maxwellian distribution , starting from a non - maxwellian initial condition .",
    "thus , the maxwell equilibrium transcends details of individual kinetic models .",
    "it is important to note that in these works , important boundary and initial conditions are imposed on the dynamics @xcite .",
    "for example , the second moment of the velocity of the particles is supposed to be finite , eqs .",
    "1.7 and 2.10 in @xcite .",
    "a possible domain of power law generalizations of maxwell s equilibrium , are the cases where one does not impose ` finite variance ' initial and/or boundary conditions .    in this manuscript",
    "we will consider a simple kinetic approach to obtain a generalization of maxwell s velocity distribution .",
    "briefly we consider a one dimensional tracer particle of mass @xmath0 randomly colliding with gas particles of mass @xmath2 .",
    "two main assumptions are used : ( i ) molecular chaos holds , implying lack of correlations in the collision process ( stoszzahlansantz ) , and ( ii ) rate of collisions is independent of the energy of the colliding particles . let the probability density function ( pdf ) of velocity of the gas particles be @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath3 is maxwellian , the model describes brownian type of motion for the heavy particle , the equilibrium being the maxwell distribution @xcite .",
    "since our aim is to investigate generalized equilibrium , we do not impose the standard condition of maxwellian velocity distribution for the bath particles .",
    "our aim is to show , under general conditions , that the equilibrium pdf of the tracer particle @xmath9 is stable .",
    "stable means here that large classes of velocity distributions for bath particles @xmath10 will yield a unique type of equilibrium for the tracer particle @xmath4 .",
    "namely the equilibrium velocity distribution transcends the details of precise shape of @xmath11 .",
    "one of those stable velocity distributions will turn out to be maxwell s velocity distribution .    to obtain an equilibrium we use two approaches .",
    "the first we call the thermodynamic approach , since it is based on the following thermodynamic argument .",
    "we know that two extensive thermal systems , a and b , left at thermal contact will obtain a thermal equilibrium with respect to each other .",
    "while the interaction between the two systems is responsible for the equilibration , the precise nature of this interaction is not important for the equilibrium properties of the composite system . in particular statistical properties of system a are independent of the coupling parameters between the two systems .",
    "the idea is that interface interaction energy is much smaller than the total energy of the two systems , and hence may be neglected . for a brownian particle ( system a ) in a liquid ( system b ) , this implies that the equilibrium velocity distribution of the brownian particle is independent of the physical and chemical nature of the liquid ( besides its temperature ) . in our model",
    "the coupling between the tracer particle and bath particle is the mass ratio @xmath12 . in the thermodynamic approach we will impose on the dynamics , the condition that the equilibrium of the heavy tracer particle is independent of the coupling @xmath13",
    "this type of dynamics yields a generalized temperature concept @xmath14 .    in the second approach ,",
    "we use a scaling argument based on the assumption that an energy scale controls the velocity distribution of the bath particles .",
    "this means that we assume @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a non - negative normalized function . here",
    "@xmath17 has similar meaning as the usual temperature . from this general starting point stable equilibrium",
    "is derived for the tracer particle .",
    "it is shown that the two approaches yield stable lvy equilibrium . however , besides the maxwellian case the two approaches yield different types of equilibrium .",
    "thus , according to our model generalized equilibrium based on lvy statistics naturally emerges , however this type of equilibrium is different from the standard equilibrium .",
    "one can not generally treat the tracer particle equilibrium properties as separable from coupling to the bath , and at the same time use standard temperature concept @xmath17 .",

    "<S> to obtain further insight on possible power law generalizations of boltzmann equilibrium concepts , a stochastic collision model is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the dynamics of a tracer particle of mass @xmath0 , undergoing elastic collisions with ideal gas particles of mass @xmath1 , in the rayleigh limit @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability density function ( pdf ) of the gas particle velocity is @xmath3 . assuming a uniform collision rate and molecular chaos , we obtain the equilibrium distribution for the velocity of the tracer particle @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> depending on asymptotic properties of @xmath3 we find that @xmath4 is either the maxwell velocity distribution or a lvy distribution . </S>",
    "<S> in particular our results yield a generalized maxwell distribution based on lvy statistics using two approaches . in the first a thermodynamic argument </S>",
    "<S> is used , imposing on the dynamics the condition that equilibrium properties of the heavy tracer particle be independent of the coupling @xmath5 to the gas particles , similar to what is found for a brownian particle in a fluid . </S>",
    "<S> this approach leads to a generalized temperature concept . in the second approach </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that bath particles velocity pdf scales with an energy scale , i.e. the ( nearly ) ordinary temperature , as found in standard statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the two approaches yield different types of lvy equilibrium which merge into a unique solution only for the maxwell  boltzmann case . </S>",
    "<S> thus , relation between thermodynamics and statistical mechanics becomes non - trivial for the power law case . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the relation of the kinetic model to fractional fokker  planck equations is discussed . </S>"
