    "in recent times , the pion nucleon coupling constant @xmath5 has remained an illusive parameter .",
    "many groups have worked on the problem using a number of different approaches , yet there is still no consensus on its value to the 1% level .",
    "this coupling is a very important _ input _ parameter in low energy qcd and nuclear physics , hence one requires its value to be determined as precisely as possible . in one example",
    ", the goldberger - treiman relation @xcite connects the @xmath4 coupling constant to the well - known weak interaction and hadronic quantities .",

    "value @xmath5 = 14.3 , it has been argued that the large quark condensate assumption of standard chiral perturbation theory may not be valid so that a `` generalized '' form of the theory may be required @xcite . from only these two examples ,",
    "clearly it is of fundamental importance to pin down @xmath5 .",
    "our recent partial wave analyses of @xmath7 scattering data up to @xmath8 mev ( latest publication in @xcite ) have included constraints from a simultaneous fixed-@xmath2 dispersion relation analysis .",
    "our most recent ( preliminary ) solution ( sm99 @xcite ) adds the forward `` derivative '' @xmath9 dispersion relations and the fixed-@xmath2 @xmath10 dispersion relation to our suite of forward @xmath10 and fixed-@xmath2 @xmath11 ( `` hper '' ) dispersion relations . in these dispersion relations ,",
    "the coupling constant @xmath12 is an _ a priori _ unknown parameter .",
    "the nucleon pole ( born ) term is a well defined quantity , and extracting the coupling constant from the dispersion relation does not involve extrapolations or interpolations .",
    "the benefits of using fixed-@xmath2 dispersion relations to obtain @xmath7 scattering parameters like the coupling constant have been extensively discussed by hhler in @xcite .    in their influential analysis ,",
    "bugg , carter , and carter @xcite employed the fixed-@xmath2 @xmath13 dispersion relation ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn : hamdr ] ) and their own partial wave analysis over a narrow energy range ( 110 - 280 mev ) to extract the coupling , obtaining @xmath5 = 14.3@xmath60.2 .",
    "the analysis was not _ constrained _ to satisfy this dispersion relation , so that value is simply what came out of the data via the partial wave analysis .",
    "this value was subsequently used in the karlsruhe analyses , in particular in the fixed-@xmath2 dispersion relation analysis of pietarinen @xcite used to constrain the partial wave solution `` kh80 '' @xcite from which the same coupling constant ( 14.3 ) was `` extracted '' using the so - called `` hper '' dispersion relation . to our knowledge",
    ", no analyses were performed to test whether other values of @xmath5 gave better results i.e. better satisfied dispersion relations , or better fits to data .    in the following",
    ", we outline our approach to extracting the pion nucleon coupling constant from the @xmath7 scattering data , where unlike previous analyses involving dispersion relations , it is treated as a free parameter to be determined by @xmath14 minimization .",
    "we discuss briefly the method in section [ sec : disprel ] , followed by the results in section [ sec : results ] and some important systematic checks we ve made in section [ sec : systchecks ] .",
    "we close in section [ sec : summary ] with a summary and some conclusions .",
    "the multi - energy partial wave analysis part of our analysis procedure has been described in refs.@xcite .",
    "this part of the analysis has _ no _ explicit dependence on the coupling constant @xmath5 and so will not be discussed here .",
    "the interested reader is referred to those publications .",
    "the sensitivity to the coupling constant enters through the fixed-@xmath2 dispersion relations used as constraints to the partial wave analysis .",
    "we employ the forward ( @xmath2=0 ) subtracted @xmath15 , and derivative @xmath16 dispersion relations , as well as the unsubtracted fixed-@xmath2 hper ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 dispersion relations .",
    "all are implemented from @xmath19 mev , and the fixed-@xmath2 relations are also applied over @xmath20 gev@xmath21/c@xmath21 .",
    "the isovector constraints can be applied to even higher energies , but presently we are having difficulty satisfying the isoscalar @xmath22 and @xmath23 dispersion relations at the higher energies . since above 2100 mev we employ the imaginary parts from the kh80 analysis @xcite , and this solution also does not satisfy those isoscalar dispersion relations very well around 1 gev , the incompatability of our solution and kh80 may be at the root of this problem .",
    "this is still under investigation .",
    "the energy range over which the constraints limits the covered momentum transfer range to @xmath24 gev@xmath21/c@xmath21 , which is safely within the region where the partial wave expansion converges @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the kinematic range over which the constraints are applied is entirely sufficient for determinations of the ccoupling constant since it spans the @xmath25 resonance region which dominates the dispersion integrals , and where there are the most abundant and precise data sets .",
    "in general , a fixed-@xmath2 dispersion relation relates the real part of the amplitude at some energy to a principal value integral over the imaginary parts at _ all _ energies , plus a nucleon pole contribution ( born term ) , and in the case of subtracted relations , an additional _ subtraction constant _ which is in general energy _",
    "independent_. ( for the definitive discussion of dispersion relations , see ref . @xcite . )",
    "this form is demonstrated by the special case of the forward @xmath26 ( isovector ) dispersion relation in eqn.[eqn : fwdc - dr ] :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 are the charged pion and proton masses , @xmath29 is the total pion energy , @xmath30 is the ( unphysical ) pion energy at the nucleon pole , @xmath31 is the born term , and @xmath32 is the subtraction constant , with the isovector s - wave scattering length @xmath33 . refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : fwdc- ] for a graphical depiction of each term in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : fwdc - dr ] .",
    "the @xmath4 coupling constant ( appearing in the born term ) and the subtraction constants are _ a priori _ unknown parameters .",
    "our approach is to treat them as _ searched parameters _ to be determined by minimizing the @xmath14 goodness - of - fit to the data _ and _ the dispersion relations .",
    "for each dispersion relation the constraint and its @xmath14 is evaluated as follows .",
    "first , the coupling constant and all subtraction constants are fixed to some value . with this set fixed , for each iteration in the partial wave analysis ,",
    "the partial waves are used to determine the principal value integral + born term + subtraction constant at a number of equally spaced kinematical points ( @xmath34 for forward dispersion relations , ( @xmath35 for fixed-@xmath2 ) to yield a prediction for the real parts .",
    "the real part is then evaluated separately using the partial waves .",
    "the difference `` @xmath36(from pwa ) - @xmath36(from dr ) '' is then used to correct the real part of the partial waves for the next iteration , and to calculate a @xmath14 using a desired accuracy ( presently set such that @xmath37 ) as the `` uncertainty '' .",
    "this procedure is iterated until the solution converges and a minimum overall @xmath14 ( fit to data + dispersion relations ) is achieved .",
    "this yields the `` best '' solution corresponding a _",
    "particular set _ of dispersion relation parameters .",
    "the entire analysis is repeated varying these parameters over a multi - dimensional `` grid '' and the minimum @xmath14 for each of these solutions recorded .",
    "it is observed that e.g. the @xmath14 versus @xmath5 curve is a parabola , and so the parameters for the final solution are determined by fitting quadratics ( or bi - quadratics to 2-dimensional plots ) to these curves and selecting the parameters corresponding to the minimum .",
    "this elaborate procedure has a number of benefits . from it one",
    "is able to define a _ statistical _",
    "uncertainty for @xmath12 by the variation which changes the overall @xmath14 by 1 .",
    "systematic _ uncertainty can be estimated from the constancy of @xmath12 over the applied kinematic range ( `` extraction error '' ) , and from the variation is the @xmath14 minimum for the separate contributions of the dispersion relations and each of the three charge channels .      when discussing the coupling constant , two dispersion relations merit special consideration .",
    "one is the isoscalar @xmath40 dispersion relation :    @xmath41\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 is the `` crossing '' energy variable , @xmath43 is the energy at the nucleon pole , and @xmath44 is the threshold energy .",
    "written in this unsubtracted form , the coupling constant is the only unknown parameter .",
    "bugg , carter , and carter used this dispersion relation @xcite and obtained @xmath12 by inputing in their phase shifts and then `` averaging '' over a kinematical range ( @xmath45 ) spanning the @xmath25 resonance .",
    "( refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : hamuxxx ] for an example of this method in our own analysis ) .",
    "this technique should yield a reliable estimate of @xmath12 since it is well known @xcite that the dispersion integral is dominated by the first @xmath46 ( @xmath47 resonance , and evaluated there it is satisfactorily convergent up to a few gev ( below which there still are abundant data ) .",
    "the other dispersion relation most useful for determining @xmath12 is the so - called `` hper '' dispersion relation ( see refs . @xcite and @xcite ) :    @xmath48 = \\frac{g^{2}}{m}+\\widetilde{b}(0,t)(\\nu _ { b}\\pm \\nu ) \\ ] ]    where @xmath49 .",
    "it is a clever combination of the invariant @xmath50 amplitudes such that at fixed @xmath2 , the left hand side of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : hueperdr ] is linear in @xmath51 with the y intercept _ independent _ of @xmath2 and equal to @xmath52 .",
    "this dispersion relation was used by koch and pietarinen in their influential `` kh80 '' analysis paper @xcite .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : huepersm99 ] for an example from our analysis ) . up to a few hundred mev ,",
    "the dispersion integrals are dominated by the @xmath25 resonance and suitably convergent up to @xmath53 _ _ _ _ 4 gev when evaluated there .",
    "they also have the property that due to crossing symmetry , the `` left ( @xmath54 side '' is dominated by @xmath55 data , and the `` right @xmath56 side '' by the @xmath57 data .",
    "as will be shown in section [ sec : coulcorrcheck ] , one consequence is that extracting @xmath12 from this dispersion relation is relatively insensitive to the coulomb corrections used in the partial wave analysis .",
    "some @xmath12 mapping results from our most recent solution ( `` sm99 '' ) @xcite are shown in figures [ fig : g2vsethchi2map ] and [ fig : f2chi2breakdown ] .",
    "figure [ fig : g2vsethchi2map ] shows the two - dimensional constant @xmath14 contours of the coupling constant versus the subtraction constant in the forward derivative @xmath58 dispersion relation .",
    "this contour plot was generated using the results of 25 ( 5x5 ) solutions spanning the range shown where all other dispersion relation parameters were fixed to their optimal values .",
    "there is a distinct and deep minimum parabolic in shape with negligible correlation between the two parameters . fitting a bi - quadratic to the contours yields @xmath5",
    "= 13.730@xmath60.009 , where the uncertainty is statistical corresponding the change @xmath59 .",
    "very similar results are observed when plotting constant @xmath14 contours of @xmath5 versus the scattering lengths .",
    "the statistical uncertainty derived from the @xmath14 contour mappings is clearly much smaller than the overall uncertainty .",
    "one way to estimate the systematic uncertainty is to plot the one - dimensional curves of @xmath14 versus @xmath5 for each of the charge channels , their sum , and the dispersion relation contributions separately , keeping all other parameters fixed to their optimal values .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : f2chi2breakdown ] .",
    "one sees that all charge channels minimize near 13.73 ( 13.70 , 13.73 , 13.88 for @xmath60and cex respectively ) as well as the dispersion relation contribution ( 13.76 ) .",
    "this spread gives one indication of the systematic uncertainty .",
    "another indication of the systematic uncertainty comes from the values extracted from the @xmath40 and hper dispersion relations .",
    "the dispersion relations in the solution sm99 were constrained with the @xmath5 = 13.73 derived from the @xmath14 mappings , but fluctuations with respect to @xmath61 and @xmath2 can arise .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig : hamsm99 ] and [ fig : huepersm99 ] .",
    "one sees an almost negligible energy and t - dependence of only about @xmath62 ( 0.2% ) over the full constraint range up to 800 mev .",
    "we refer to this as the extraction uncertainty , and see again that it is small with respect to the variations seen in fig.[fig : f2chi2breakdown ] .",
    "a number of checks were made in order to gauge other sources of systematic uncertainty .",
    "one check was to generate a partial wave analysis solution with _ no dispersion relation constraints whatsoever _ and then use the resulting amplitudes in the dispersion relations to extract @xmath5 .",
    "this is in effect the approach used by many other prior works , including that of bugg , carter , and carter @xcite .",
    "this was done to see if the dispersion relation constraints were `` pulling '' @xmath12 away from a value preferred by the data alone .",
    "this turns out _ not _ to be the case . over the same ( @xmath35",
    "ranged used in the constrained analysis , the dispersion relation - free solution yields @xmath5 = 13.66@xmath63 ( 1.3% ) from the @xmath40 dispersion relation ( see fig.[fig : hamuxxx ] ) , and 13.66@xmath64 from the hper dispersion relation ( not shown ) , where only the extraction uncertainties are quoted . up to 450 mev , where their are ample modern , precise cross section and polarization data from the meson factories , these dispersion relations yield about 13.77@xmath64 .",
    "in fact up to @xmath53500 mev _ all _ the fixed-@xmath2 dispersion relations used in the constrained analysis are reasonably well satisfied .",
    "this is an important observation : to a decent approximation , the low and intermediate energy scattering data exhibit the analytic properties expected of them , and so applying dispersion relation constraints to a partial wave analysis solution has the effect of `` fine tuning '' the amplitudes and not drastically altering them from their unconstrained state .",
    "the dispersion relations must use amplitudes from which all coulomb contributions have been removed ( i.e. `` hadronic amplitudes '' ) , consequently a systematic contribution to @xmath12 can enter through the coulomb correction scheme employed .",
    "the direct coulomb and coulomb phase rotation prescription used in our analysis comes from the nordita analysis @xcite which was used in the karlsruhe - helsinki kh80 solution @xcite .",
    "our prescription for the coulomb barrier correction has been criticized as being too simple ( see e.g. @xcite ) . to test the effect of our coulomb barrier correction scheme on the coupling constant extraction",
    ", we made a solution taking the radical step of _ ignoring it altogether .",
    "_ the minimum in the overall @xmath14 was found to be 13.70 , varying from @xmath5313.45 for @xmath57 to 13.72 for @xmath55 and 13.67 for charge exchange . since",
    "surely our coulomb barrier correction is more accurate than ignoring it altogether , we conclude that the systematic uncertainty due to our coulomb barrier correction scheme is not significant with respect to the other systematic uncertainties .    it is interesting to note the effect of the coulomb barrier correction on the hper dispersion relation .",
    "we reintroduced the correction into the hadronic amplitudes and calculated the dispersion relation as before .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig : huepercoulcheck ] .",
    "the correction suppresses ( enhances ) the @xmath57 ( @xmath65 amplitudes . since the plot is dominated by @xmath57 ( @xmath65 data on the right ( left ) hand side , the effect is to `` rotate '' the line around the intercept , leaving it , hence the coupling constant , relatively unchanged .",
    "one sees in fig.[fig : huepercoulcheck ] that the result changes by only 1.3% ( 13.55 _ vs. _ 13.73 ) .",
    "clearly this insensitivity to the coulomb correction makes the hper dispersion relation valuable for determining the coupling constant .",
    "another source of systematic uncertainty comes from the elastic pion proton scattering database .",
    "as has been mentioned , it is well known that the @xmath25 resonance amplitude dominates most of the dispersion relations .",
    "it was shown in the context of the goldberger - miyazawa - oehme sum rule @xcite that the difference between the pedroni , et al .",
    "@xcite and carter , et al .",
    "@xcite , total @xmath66 cross sections results in a 1% change in @xmath12 , so it is important to study the database contribution uncertainties in the context of our full analysis .",
    "we constructed a solution where the total cross section data of pedroni , et al .",
    ", were removed , and one where the total cross section data of carter , et al .",
    ", the total cex reaction cross section data of bugg , et al .",
    "@xcite , and the differential @xmath66 differential cross section data of bussey , et al .",
    "@xcite were removed .",
    "we found only a small change of about @xmath67 with respect to our normal solution .",
    "as opposed to the result in @xcite , the effect of a number of fixed-@xmath2 dispersion relation constraints and many data sets ( differential , partial total , and polarization ) reduces the sensitivity to any single measurement    we constructed yet another solution where _ all _ charge exchange data were removed from the database .",
    "this cex - less solution results in a best fit coupling of 13.65 , which is only 0.6% lower than the nominal value 13.73 .",
    "this is expected , since one sees from fig.[fig : f2chi2breakdown ] that the @xmath14 minimum occurs at a larger @xmath5 for cex than for @xmath66 .",
    "it should be noted that in the process of analyzing the @xmath66 scattering data over the years , many new data have entered the database , and we have tried many solutions accepting some and deleting other data sets .",
    "none of these changes have ever caused a large change in @xmath5 , and the result has remained stable around 13.73 since at least 1993 .",
    "we conclude that the database incompatibilities that do exist in the current database do not contribute greatly to the coupling constant uncertainty .",
    "we have outlined our approach to extracting the pion nucleon coupling constant @xmath5 from the @xmath68 elastic scattering database using fixed-@xmath2 dispersion relations . obtaining the",
    "coupling constant from these dispersion relations is theoretically unambiguous and relies on the general principles of analyticity , unitarity , and crossing symmetry @xcite .",
    "the coupling constant was treated as a searched parameter to be determined by a least - squares fit to the data and the dispersion relations . from our most recent analysis ( solution sm99 )",
    ", our result is @xmath5 = 13.73@xmath69 , where the first uncertainty is statistical ( corresponding to a change @xmath59 ) and the second is systematic .",
    "the latter uncertainty was estimated from the differences in the @xmath14 minima for each of the charge channels and the dispersion relations ( fig.[fig : f2chi2breakdown ] ) , from changes to the @xmath68 scattering database , from modifications to the coulomb barrier corrections ( fig.[fig : huepercoulcheck ] ) , from a solution with _ no _ dispersion relation constraints ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hamuxxx ] ) , and from the variations over the kinematical range where the dispersion relations were applied ( figs .",
    "[ fig : hamsm99 ] and [ fig : huepersm99 ] ) .",
    "our result is in serious contradiction with the recent results from np backward scattering differential cross section measurements ( see e.g. @xcite and other contributions to these proceedings ) of @xmath7014.5@xmath71 , though more in line with the results of the a similar analysis by arndt , et al . @xcite .",
    "the difference is about 9 of our standard deviations .",
    "it is very difficult to see how our result could be in error by this amount .",
    "nevertheless we are continuing our efforts to update the analysis as data new data come in , and to refine our methods in order to extract the most precise value of @xmath5 possible .",
    "it should be noted that the coupling constant result 13.73 resolves the problem with the goldberger - treiman discrepancy ( @xcite,@xcite ) which is too large using the larger coupling .",
    "also it has recently been shown @xcite that the dashen - weinstein sum rule @xcite ( corrected for some higher order chiral effects ) is not consistent with the larger coupling , favouring instead a value near 13.7 .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite that recent measurements of threshold pion photoproduction are more consistently described in chiral perturbation theory with the smaller coupling than the larger .",
    "along with many other recent determinations which have arrived at a lower coupling constant ( refer to the review @xcite , the fact that these important aspects of low energy qcd are more consistently described with a coupling constant near 13.7 rather than 14.3 is in our opinion a good argument in favour of adopting the lower value as the current standard .",
