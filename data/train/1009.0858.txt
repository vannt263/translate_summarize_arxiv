    "a long standing open problem in the theory of dynamical systems is to describe which kind of dynamical phenomena can be expected in close to identity maps .",
    "it started with a much celebrated paper @xcite where it was shown that any @xmath0-dimensional dynamics can be implemented by a @xmath8-small perturbation of the identity map of an @xmath0-dimensional torus .",
    "the paper seized a lot of attention by physicists , because it proposed a new view on the onset of hydrodynamical turbulence ; at the same time it caused a lot of criticism .",
    "one of the reasons for the critique was that the @xmath8-small perturbations constructed in @xcite were not small in @xmath9 , which is quite unphysical .",
    "the controversy was resolved in @xcite where it was shown that for any @xmath10 , given any @xmath1-diffeomorphism @xmath11 of a closed @xmath0-dimensional ball , one can find a @xmath1-close to identity map @xmath2 of the @xmath12-dimensional closed unit ball @xmath13 such that the diffeomorphism @xmath11 coincides with some iteration of the map @xmath2 restricted to some @xmath0-dimensional invariant manifold .",
    "thus , the restriction on smoothness of perturbations was removed by sacrificing one dimension of the phase space ; anyway , other scenarios of the transitions to turbulence had already been known .    from the purely mathematical point of view",
    ", the question still remained unsolved : can an arbitrary @xmath0-dimensional dynamics be obtained by iterations of a @xmath1-close to identity map of @xmath5 , i.e. in the same dimension of the phase space ?",
    "the difficulty is that the straightforward construction proposed in @xcite does not work for high @xmath10 in principle .",
    "indeed , given an orientation - preserving diffeomorphism @xmath14 , one can imbed it into a continuous family @xmath15 of the diffeomorphisms such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 . then , given any @xmath18 , the map @xmath11 can be represented as a superposition of @xmath18 maps @xmath19 that are @xmath20-close to identity .",
    "one can then choose @xmath18 pairwise disjoint small balls @xmath21 of radius @xmath22 and define a map @xmath23 such that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the center of @xmath26 ; the positions of the centers are chosen in such a way ( fig.1 ) that the distances @xmath27 are uniformly close to zero for all @xmath28 , hence the map @xmath29 is @xmath30-close to identity . by construction , @xmath31 is linearly conjugate to @xmath11 , i.e. the dynamics of @xmath31 coincides with the dynamics of @xmath11 .",
    "however , the derivatives of @xmath29 of order @xmath32 behave as @xmath33 , i.e. at @xmath34 they do not , in general , tend to zero as @xmath35 . thus",
    ", an arbitrary @xmath0-dimensional dynamics can be implemented by iterations of @xmath36-close to identity maps of @xmath5 , but the construction gives no clue of whether the same can be said about the @xmath8-close to identity maps .",
    "one could try to position the regions @xmath26 differently , or make their radii vary , or change their shape .",
    "this , however , hardly can lead to an essential increase in the maximal order of the derivatives ( of @xmath29 ) which tend to zero as @xmath35 .",
    "the reason lies in a well - known fact from the averaging theory that the @xmath37-close to identity map @xmath38 approximates a time shift of a certain autonomous flow with the accuracy @xmath39 for an arbitrarily large @xmath40 ( if @xmath41 ) .",
    "hence , the number of iterations necessary in order to obtain a dynamics which is far from that of an autonomous flow , has to grow faster than @xmath42 , for every @xmath40 . as we see , in order to obtain such kind of dynamics , one has to control a very large number of iterations of close to identity maps , hence decompositions much longer than that given by ( [ ruta ] ) have to be considered .    in this paper",
    "we propose such a decomposition ( theorem [ thm3 ] ) , using which we show that + _ an arbitrary @xmath1-generic orientation - preserving @xmath0-dimensional dynamics can be obtained by iterations of @xmath1-close to identity maps of @xmath5 , @xmath6 . _    to make the formulations precise , we borrow some definitions from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be a @xmath1-diffeomorphism of a closed @xmath0-dimensional ball @xmath43 .",
    "take an integer @xmath44 and any @xmath1-diffeomorphism @xmath45 of @xmath46 such that @xmath47 .",
    "the map @xmath48 is a @xmath1-diffeomorphism that maps @xmath5 into @xmath46 .",
    "we will call the maps @xmath49 obtained by this procedure _",
    "renormalized iterations of @xmath2_.    @xmath50 [ thm1 ] in the space of @xmath1-smooth orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath5 into @xmath46 ( @xmath6 ) there is a residual set @xmath51 such that for every map @xmath52 , for every @xmath53 and for every @xmath0-dimensional ball @xmath43 there exists a map @xmath54 , equal to identity outside @xmath43 , such that @xmath55 and @xmath11 is a renormalized iteration of @xmath2 .    in other words ,",
    "a generic @xmath1-diffeomorphism @xmath7 is , up to a smooth coordinate transformation , an iteration of an arbitrarily close to identity map .",
    "this theorem is proven in section [ proof1 ] .",
    "actually , we prove there that + _ for any @xmath53 and @xmath56 , for every orientation - preserving @xmath1-diffeomorphism @xmath14 there exists a @xmath57-close to identity map @xmath2 , equal to identity outside a given ball @xmath43 , such that @xmath58 for some renormalized iteration @xmath48 _ ( it is enough to prove this for one particular ball @xmath43 that may depend on @xmath11 , but the choice of @xmath43 should be fixed in advance , not depending on @xmath57 nor on the accuracy @xmath59 of the approximation ; then for other balls the claim will remain true because there always exists an affine conjugacy that takes one ball to the other ) .",
    "moreover , we construct the map @xmath2 and the coordinate transformation @xmath45 in such a way that the balls @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) do not intersect each other  hence , by adding small , localized in @xmath62 , perturbations to @xmath2 , we may make @xmath49 run an open subset in the space of @xmath1-diffeomorphisms @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the set @xmath63 of all renormalized iterations of the maps @xmath64 such that @xmath55 contains a subset which is open and dense in the space of @xmath1-smooth orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath5 into @xmath46 , for every @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the intersection @xmath51 of these sets over all @xmath53 is residual ( and independent of the choice of @xmath43 ) , which gives us the theorem .",
    "the first step in our construction of the approximations of the given map @xmath11 by renormalized iterations is a representation of @xmath11 as a superposition of a pair of certain special maps and some volume - preserving diffeomorphisms ( lemma [ lm1 ] ) .",
    "each of the special maps can be realized as a flow map through a kind of saddle - node bifurcation ( see fig.2 ) , reminiscent of the so - called `` iljashenko lips '' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for the volume - preserving diffeomorphisms one may adjust the results obtained in @xcite for symplectic diffeomorphisms and prove ( lemma [ lm2 ] ) the existence of an arbitrarily good , in the @xmath1-norm on any compact , polynomial approximation by a superposition of volume - preserving hnon - like maps .",
    "it is known that hnon - like maps often appear as rescaled first - return maps near a homoclinic tangency ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we find a kind of homoclinic tangency which does incorporate all the hnon - like maps that appear in our volume - preserving polynomial approximations .",
    "thus , we show that the map @xmath11 can be approximated arbitrarily well by a superposition of maps related to certain homoclinic bifurcations .",
    "the last step is to build a close to identity map which displays these bifurcations simultaneously .",
    "this is achieved by an arbitrarily small perturbation of the time-@xmath57 map of a certain @xmath65 flow ( the time @xmath57 map of a flow is , obviously , @xmath37-close to identity ) .",
    "note that the approximation ( that we construct in lemma [ lm2 ] ) of any volume - preserving diffeomorphism of a unit ball into @xmath46 by a polynomial volume - preserving diffeomorphism is not straightforward , because the jacobian of the approximating diffeomorphism should be equal to @xmath3 everywhere , and this constrain is quite strong for polynomial maps .",
    "had the approximation result been true for all volume - preserving maps , i.e. not necessarily diffeomorphisms , it would produce a counterexample to the famous `` jacobian conjecture '' ; however , our approximation uses in an essential way the injectivity of the map that has to be approximated ( we represent the map as a shift by the orbits of some smooth non - autonomous flow ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that theorem [ thm1 ] does not hold true at @xmath66 .",
    "indeed , if a map @xmath11 on the interval @xmath67 has two fixed points ( with the multipliers different from @xmath3 ) , then every close map @xmath68 has a pair of fixed points @xmath69 as well .",
    "if such @xmath68 is a renormalized iteration of a diffeomorphism @xmath2 , i.e. if @xmath70 , then @xmath2 will also have a pair of fixed points , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( at @xmath73 this is not true ) .",
    "the interval between @xmath74 and @xmath75 will therefore be invariant with respect to @xmath76 , hence @xmath76 will be a root of degree @xmath77 of the map @xmath68 on this interval .",
    "now note that the maps of the interval that have a root are not dense in @xmath78 , according to @xcite .",
    "thus we obtain that renormalized iterations are not dense either .",
    "one can check through the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] that it holds true for finite - parameter families of orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms : + _ in the space of @xmath32-parameter families @xmath79 , @xmath80 , of @xmath1-smooth orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath5 into @xmath46 ( @xmath6 ) there is a residual set @xmath81 such that for every @xmath82 and for every @xmath53 there exists @xmath83 such that @xmath84 and @xmath85 for some @xmath44 and some family @xmath86 of @xmath1-diffeomorphisms of @xmath46 . _",
    "+ thus , any dynamical phenomenon which occurs generically in finite - parameter families of dynamical systems can be encountered in maps arbitrarily close to identity ( with the same dimension of the phase space ) .    to put the result into a general perspective",
    ", we recall that one of the main sources of difficulties in the theory of dynamical systems is that structurally stable systems are not dense in the space of all systems @xcite , moreover most natural examples of chaotic dynamics are indeed structurally unstable ( like e.g. the famous lorenz attractor @xcite ) .",
    "understanding the dynamics of systems from the open regions of structural instability ( i.e. the regions where arbitrarily close to every system there is a system which is not topologically conjugate to it ) has been the subject of active research for the past four decades .",
    "it often happens , and helps a lot , that structurally unstable systems may possess certain robust properties , i.e. dynamical properties which are not destroyed by small perturbations .",
    "for example , systems with lorenz attractor are pseudohyperbolic ( or volume - hyperbolic ) @xcite , and this is , in fact , the very property which allowed for a very detailed description of them @xcite .",
    "another robust property is uniform partial hyperbolicity , a rich theory of systems possessing it is actively developing @xcite . in fact , not so much of robust properties are known , it could even happen that beyond the mentioned partial hyperbolicity and volume - hyperbolicity no other robust dynamical properties exist .",
    "this claim can be demonstrated for various examples of homoclinic bifurcations ( see @xcite ) , and can be used as a guiding principle in the study of bifurcations of systems with a non - trivial dynamics : + _ given an @xmath0-dimensional system with a compact invariant set that is neither partially- nor volume - hyperbolic , every dynamics that is possible in @xmath5 should be expected to occur at the bifurcations of this particular system . _",
    "+ the last statement is not a theorem and it might be not true in some situations , still it gives a useful view on global bifurcations .",
    "in particular , it was explicitly applied in @xcite to galerkin approximations of damped nonlinear wave equations in order to obtain estimates from below on the dimension of attractors in the situation where classical methods @xcite do not work .",
    "theorem [ thm1 ] gives one more example to the above stated principle : the identity map has no kind of hyperbolic structure , neither it contracts nor expands volumes , so it should not be surprising that its bifurcations provide an ultimately rich dynamics .",
    "the same idea can be expressed in somewhat different terms .",
    "let us call the set of all renormalized iterations of a map @xmath64 its _ dynamical conjugacy class_. the map will be called _",
    "@xcite ) if its dynamical conjugacy class is @xmath1-dense among all orientation - preserving @xmath1-diffeomorphisms of the closed unit ball @xmath5 into @xmath46 . by the definition , the dynamics of any single universal map is ultimately complicated and rich , and the detailed understanding of it is not simpler than understanding of all diffeomorphisms @xmath7 altogether .    at the first glance ,",
    "the mere existence of @xmath1-univesal maps of a closed ball is not obvious for sufficiently large @xmath10 .",
    "however , theorem [ thm1 ] immediately implies the following    @xmath50 [ thm2 ] for every @xmath4 , @xmath1-universal diffeomorphisms of a given closed ball @xmath43 exist arbitrarily close , in the @xmath1-metric , to the identity map .    _",
    "proof_. take an arbitrary sequence of pairwise disjoint closed balls @xmath87 , a sequence of maps @xmath88 which is @xmath1-dense in space of orientation - preserving @xmath1-diffeomorphisms @xmath7 , and a sequence @xmath89 as @xmath90 . by theorem [ thm1 ] ,",
    "given any @xmath57 , there exist maps @xmath91 such that @xmath91 is identity outside @xmath92 , some renormalized iteration of @xmath91 is @xmath93-close to @xmath88 , and @xmath94 .",
    "by construction , the map @xmath95 at @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) and @xmath98 at @xmath99 is @xmath1-universal and @xmath57-close to identity .",
    "@xmath100    as an immediate consequence of theorem [ thm2 ] , we note that + _ arbitrarily close to identity map in the space of @xmath1-diffeomorphisms @xmath101 ( any @xmath102 , any @xmath6 ) there exist maps with infinitely many coexisting uniformly - hyperbolic attractors of all possible topological types .",
    "_ + this is true because a hyperbolic attractor is a structurally stable object : given a map with a uniformly - hyperbolic attractor , any @xmath103-close map has a hyperbolic attractor topologically conjugate to the original one . for every @xmath6 there exists a @xmath1-diffeomorphism @xmath7 with a hyperbolic attractor",
    "hence , infinitely many of the maps @xmath88 in the proof of theorem [ thm2 ] have a hyperbolic attractor as well .",
    "it follows that each universal map constructed in theorem [ thm2 ] has infinitely many hyperbolic attractors ( and repellers , for that matter ) .",
    "thus , we can further pursue the approach of @xcite and claim that hyperbolic attractors can be born at the third andronov - hopf bifurcation . recall that at the primary andronov - hopf bifurcation a limit cycle is born from an equilibrium state , and at the secondary andronov - hopf bifurcation a two - dimensional invariant torus is born from the limit cycle .",
    "the third andronov - hopf bifurcation occurs when a three - dimensional invariant torus is born from the two - dimensional one ( filled by quasiperiodic orbits ) .",
    "the so - called landau - hopf scenario of the onset of turbulence envisioned a chain of further andronov - hopf bifurcations which would lead to a creation of an invariant torus of a sufficiently high dimension , i.e. to a quasiperiodic regime with a high number of rationally independent frequencies ( see more discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "however , as ruelle and takens pointed out in @xcite , the dynamics on the invariant torus is not necessarily quasiperiodic : at the moment the torus is born , the system can be perturbed in such a way that every orbit on the torus will become periodic , hence the poincar map will be the identity , hence , as it follows from our results above , a further small perturbation may lead to a chaotic dynamics for a flow on the torus of dimension 3 or higher .",
    "in general , it follows from theorem [ thm2 ] that every time we have a periodic orbit for which the corresponding poincar map is , locally , identity : @xmath104 or coincides with identity up to flat ( i.e. sufficiently high order ) terms : @xmath105 a @xmath1-small perturbation of the system can make the poincar map universal , i.e. bifurcations of this orbit can produce dynamics as complicated as it only possible for the given dimension of the phase space .",
    "thus , arbitrarily complicated dynamical phenomena can be uncovered by the study of bifurcations of periodic orbits alone .    in order to show how powerful this observation can be ,",
    "let us apply it to the analysis of the dynamics of two - dimensional diffeomorphisms from the newhouse domain .",
    "in the space of @xmath1-smooth dynamical systems on any smooth manifold , newhouse domain is the interior of the closure of the set of systems that have a homoclinic tangency ( a tangency between the stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle periodic orbit ; for a saddle periodic orbit to exist , the dimension of the phase space should be at least @xmath106 in the case of continuous time and at least @xmath107 for discrete dynamical systems ) .",
    "a non - trivial fact @xcite is that the newhouse domain at @xmath108 is always non - empty and adjoins to every system with a homoclinic tangency .",
    "importantly , most of known global bifurcations which lead to the emergence of chaotic dynamics or happen within the class of systems with complex ( chaotic ) behavior are accompanied by a creation of homoclinic tangencies .",
    "therefore , newhouse regions in the space of parameters can be detected for virtually every dynamical model with chaos ( see more discussion in @xcite ) . in my opinion ,",
    "the ubiquitous presence of homoclinic tangencies in the dynamical models of a natural origin makes the study of maps from the newhouse domain the most important problem of chaotic dynamics .",
    "it should also be mentioned that a commonly shared believe ( with no hope to prove yet ) is that the space of two - dimensional @xmath1-diffeomorphisms with @xmath108 is the closure of the union of just three open sets : morse - smale systems ( i.e. systems with simple dynamics ) , axiom a systems , and the newhouse domain , i.e. unless a two - dimensional map with a chaotic dynamics is uniformly hyperbolic , it most probably lies in the newhouse domain .",
    "typically , a map from the newhouse domain possesses an invariant basic hyperbolic set which is wild  the term meaning that for the map itself , and for every @xmath1-close map ( @xmath108 ) , there exists a pair of orbits within the hyperbolic set such that the unstable manifold of one orbit has a quadratic tangency with the stable manifold of the other @xcite . for a fixed pair of orbits ,",
    "the corresponding tangency is a codimension-@xmath3 bifurcation phenomenon , so it can always be removed by a small smooth perturbation ; the wildness , nevertheless , means that once the original tangency is removed a new tangency always appears , corresponding to some other pair of orbits from the same hyperbolic set .",
    "a wild hyperbolic set of a @xmath1-diffeomorphism of a two - dimensional smooth manifold will be called _ ultimately wild _ if it contains a pair of periodic orbits such that the saddle value at one periodic orbit is less than @xmath3 and at the other periodic orbit it is greater than @xmath3 .",
    "the open subset of the newhouse domain which corresponds to maps with ultimately wild hyperbolic sets will be called the _ absolute newhouse domain_. the saddle value is , by definition , the absolute value of the product of multipliers of the periodic orbit .",
    "if @xmath109 is a period @xmath110 point of a map @xmath111 ( i.e. @xmath112 ) , its multipliers are the eigenvalues of the matrix of derivatives of @xmath113 at the point @xmath109 . therefore , if the saddle value is greater than @xmath3 in the absolute value , then the map @xmath111 expands area near @xmath109 , and it is area - contracting near @xmath109 if the saddle value is less than @xmath3 .",
    "so , no map from the absolute newhouse domain is area - contracting , nor area - expanding .",
    "moreover , the persistent tangencies between the stable and unstable manifolds of the wild hyperbolic set mean that none of these maps is uniformly hyperbolic , nor uniformly partially - hyperbolic . thus , there is no obvious restrictions on the dynamics of two - dimensional diffeomorphisms from the absolute newhouse domain , and the following theorem is , therefore , in agreement with the general `` guiding principle '' formulated in section [ rtu ] .",
    "@xmath50 [ thmn ] for every @xmath108 , a @xmath1-generic diffeomorphism from the absolute newhouse domain is @xmath1-universal .    _",
    "proof_. fix any @xmath108 and let a @xmath1-diffeomorphism of a smooth two - dimensional manifold possess an ultimately wild basic hyperbolic set @xmath114 .",
    "let @xmath115 and @xmath109 be two saddle periodic points in @xmath114 ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) with the saddle values @xmath118 and @xmath119 such that @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "as the periodic points @xmath115 and @xmath109 are hyperbolic , they are preserved at all sufficiently small perturbations .",
    "recall also that the unstable manifold of every point in the basic hyperbolic set has a transverse intersection with the stable manifold of every other orbit in this set .",
    "therefore , the invariant unstable manifold @xmath122 intersects the invariant stable manifold @xmath123 transversely at the points of some heteroclinic orbit @xmath124 . by the transversality",
    ", this orbit is preserved for all maps sufficiently close to @xmath111 . according to @xcite , given every @xmath125 , in any neighborhood of @xmath111 in the @xmath1-topology",

    "this is a non - trivial statement : while the possibility to obtain a quadratic tangency ( i.e. @xmath129 ) by an arbitrarily small perturbation follows immediately from the wildness of @xmath114 and from the fact that the stable and unstable manifold of any given periodic orbit in the basic hyperbolic set are dense within the union of stable and , respectively , unstable manifolds of all orbits in this set @xcite , the tangencies of higher orders are due to the existence of moduli of local @xmath130-conjugacy @xcite .",
    "let @xmath131 be a @xmath1-close to @xmath111 diffeomorphism for which the above described heteroclinic cycle exists .",
    "this cycle is a closed set that consists of @xmath132 orbits : two periodic orbits ( the orbits of @xmath115 and @xmath109 ) with @xmath120 and @xmath121 , a transverse heteroclinic @xmath124 and the orbit @xmath128 of heteroclinic tangency of a sufficiently high order @xmath40",

    ", as we mentioned in the beginning of this section , it follows from theorem [ thm2 ] that in any @xmath1-neighborhood of @xmath135 there exist @xmath1-universal maps .",
    "we have just shown ( modulo lemma [ thmn2 ] which is proved in section [ henhom ] ) that universal maps are dense in the absolute newhouse domain .",
    "this immediately implies the genericity of the universal maps . indeed , given an orientation - preserving @xmath1-diffeomorphism @xmath2 of the unit disk into @xmath138 , denote as @xmath139 the set of all @xmath1-diffeomorphisms from the absolute newhouse domain whose dynamical conjugacy class intersects the open @xmath57-neighborhood of @xmath2 ( i.e. whose certain renormalized iteration is at a @xmath1-distance smaller than @xmath57 from @xmath2 ) .",

    "the countable intersection @xmath142 is a residual subset of the absolute newhouse domain , and every map that belongs to this set is universal .",
    "@xmath100    in essence , this theorem gives an exhaustive characterization of the richness of dynamical behavior in the absolute newhouse domain : every two - dimensional dynamics can be approximated by iterations of any generic map from this domain . in a simpler case of the newhouse domain in the space of area - preserving maps , a similar statement is contained in @xcite : iterations of a generic area - preserving map from the newhouse domain approximate all symplectic dynamics in a two - dimensional disc .",
    "for _ area - contracting _ maps , it follows from @xcite that the closure of the dynamical conjugacy class of a generic map from the newhouse domain contains all _ one - dimensional _ maps ( we can not have truly two - dimensional dynamics here , as the areas are contracted ) . as we mentioned , any two - dimensional map which is not in the class of maps with a uniformly - hyperbolic structure , nor on the boundary of this class , falls , hypothetically , in one of the three types of the newhouse domain : the first is filled by area - contracting maps , the second by area - expanding maps ( i.e. the maps inverse to the maps of the first type ) , and the third is the absolute newhouse domain .",
    "we see that our theorem [ thmn ] somehow completes the description of two - dimensional dynamics .",
    "the three types of newhouse domains of two - dimensional maps were introduced in @xcite .",
    "it has been known since @xcite that a generic area - contracting map from the newhouse domain has an infinite set of stable periodic orbits , and the closure of this set contains a ( wild ) hyperbolic set .",
    "the latter fact is especially important : while chaotic dynamics is usually associated with hyperbolic sets , i.e. with saddle orbits , the newhouse result shows that stable periodic motions can imitate chaos arbitrarily well , and they indeed do it generically . in @xcite , for the newhouse domain of the third type , it was shown that a generic map has both an infinite set of stable periodic orbits and an infinite set of repelling periodic orbits , moreover the intersection of these sets is non - empty and contains an ultimately - wild hyperbolic set .",
    "thus , not only the newhouse phenomenon holds , we also have a new effect here : a generic inseparability of attractors from repellers .",
    "in fact , these attractors and repellers can be more complicated than just periodic orbits : in @xcite , the coexistence of infinitely many closed invariant curves was established for two - dimensional maps from the newhouse domains of the third type .",
    "our theorem [ thmn ] strengthens these observations : it implies the coexistence of infinitely many hyperbolic attractors and repellers for a generic map from the absolute newhouse domain ( see remarks to theorem [ thm2 ] ) .",
    "as we obtain the hyperbolic attractors and repellers by a perturbation of periodic spots , and the periodic spots are found in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of any heteroclinic cycle of the type we consider in theorem [ thmn ] , it follows that the closures of the set of hyperbolic attractors and of the set of hyperbolic repellers that we construct here contain any transverse heteroclinic orbit connecting the points @xmath115 and @xmath109 .",
    "such heteroclinic orbits are dense in the basic hyperbolic set @xmath114 .",
    "thus , it follows from the proof of the theorem that + _ a @xmath1-generic two - dimensional map from the absolute newhouse domain has an infinite set of uniformly - hyperbolic attractors and an infinite set of uniformly - hyperbolic repellers , and the intersection of the closures of these sets contains a non - trivial hyperbolic set . _",

    "we may take any @xmath864 as the coordinate @xmath865 of the fixed point of ( [ retmap ] ) ; then the second equation defines the corresponding value of @xmath866 . after shifting the origin to the fixed point",
    ", the map takes the form @xmath867 where the coefficients @xmath868 , @xmath869 , are related to @xmath870 by a diffeomorphism : @xmath871 @xmath872 and @xmath873 as we see , bounded values of @xmath874 give us bounded values of @xmath875 as well .",
    "we will further fix @xmath876 and will take @xmath877 , so the map will limit , as @xmath508 , to @xmath878 the fixed point of this map at @xmath879 has a double multiplier @xmath880 .",
    "let us recall the normal form theory for maps with such a fixed point .",
    "in general , we can always write such map in the form @xmath881 by denoting @xmath882 , the map takes the form @xmath883 here @xmath884 where @xmath885 stand for polynomial functions of the coefficients @xmath886 and @xmath887 with @xmath888 ; each monomial in @xmath885 has degree @xmath107 or higher .",
    "after the polynomial coordinate transformation @xmath889 , where @xmath890 the map will retain its form ( [ parnorf2 ] ) with the coefficients @xmath891 unchanged for @xmath892 , and @xmath893 at @xmath894 . as we see , by choosing @xmath895 appropriately , one can make @xmath891 with @xmath896 assume any given values .",
    "thus , by making such transformations consecutively , with @xmath0 running from @xmath107 to @xmath40 , one can make all the coefficients @xmath891 with @xmath897 vanish ; the new coefficients @xmath891 ( @xmath898 ) differ from the old ones by nonlinear ( i.e. quadratic and higher order ) expressions which depend only on the coefficients @xmath899 with @xmath888 , i.e. they are still given by ( [ norfgam ] ) with some new @xmath885 . obviously ,",
    "for any fixed @xmath40 , we arrive to a similar conclusion for any map ( with a fixed point at zero ) whose linear part is sufficiently close to that of ( [ parnorf ] ) .",
    "specifically , for any sufficiently small @xmath900 , a map of the form @xmath901 can be brought by a smooth coordinate transformation to the normal form @xmath902 where @xmath903 here @xmath885 is a polynomial of @xmath886 and @xmath887 with @xmath888 , all monomials of @xmath885 are of degree at least @xmath107 ; the function @xmath904 is a linear function of @xmath886 and @xmath887 with @xmath905 ; the coefficients of @xmath885 and @xmath904 depend on @xmath900 as well , and @xmath904 vanish at @xmath906 .    in fact , given any @xmath40 , for any sufficiently small @xmath900 , there exists a pair of functions @xmath907 such that after an appropriate choice of the coordinates @xmath760 , map ( [ parnf ] ) can be made @xmath908-close to the time-@xmath3 map by a flow of the form @xmath909 obviously , the flow has to have an equilibrium at zero and the eigenvalues of the corresponding linearization matrix have to be logarithms of the eigenvalues of @xmath910 , the linearization matrix of ( [ parnf ] ) .",
    "thus , we assume @xmath911 the time-@xmath205 map of ( [ flwuv ] ) can be found by expanding it in powers of the initial conditions @xmath912 .",

    "two maps of form ( [ parnf ] ) can be made @xmath908-close by means of a smooth coordinate transformation if their normal forms ( [ parnf2 ] ) coincide up to the order @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we find from formulas ( [ norfpam]),([psilin12]),([flalb ] ) that a map of form ( [ parnf ] ) can indeed , after an appropriate coordinate transformation , be made @xmath908-close to the time-@xmath3 map by a flow of form ( [ flwuv ] ) with the coefficients defined by @xmath920 where @xmath921 is a polynomial function of @xmath922 and @xmath923 with @xmath924 ; the monomials that include @xmath922 or @xmath923 with @xmath918 are of degree @xmath107 or higher , while the terms that include @xmath922 or @xmath923 with @xmath925 are linear and the corresponding coefficients are small of order @xmath913 .",
