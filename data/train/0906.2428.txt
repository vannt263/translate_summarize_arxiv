    "late - type companions have been proposed as a means of explaining the wide range of l@xmath25 values observed for some mid - to - late b stars in orion with weak winds ( stelzer et al .",
    "2005 )      if irs 1 has an ionized wind and a sufficiently strong magnetic field , then the b field can confine the wind into two oppositely directed streams in each hemisphere which collide near the magnetic equator , forming a magnetically - confined wind shock ( mcws )",
    ". such a shock can reach x - ray emitting temperatures .",
    "the mcws mechanism has been used to explain high - temperature x - ray emission in magnetic ap - bp stars ( babel & montmerle 1997a ) and young magnetic o stars such as @xmath82 ori c ( babel & montmerle 1997b ; gagn et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the radio properties of of irs 1 do suggest it has an ionized wind or jet ( carrasco - gonzalez et al .",
    "2007 ) , but there are so far no reports of a magnetic field .",
    "even so , an estimate of the field strength needed to confine the wind can be obtained by making reasonable approximations under the assumption that it is a mid - to - late b star .",
    "the maximum x - ray temperature for a mcws is given by the adiabatic shock equation ( sec .",
    "we thus assume a terminal wind speed v@xmath73 @xmath16 1300 km s@xmath27 for irs 1 to achieve a shock temperature comparable to the observed value ( kt@xmath68 @xmath16 2 kev ) .",
    "the degree to which the wind is confined by the magnetic field is expressed in terms of the confinement parameter @xmath83 = b@xmath84r@xmath85/@xmath86v@xmath73 where b is the equatorial magnetic field strength ( ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) . for values of @xmath83",
    "@xmath6 1 ( critical confinement ) , the b field is able to confine the wind . for a b5v star ( r@xmath77 @xmath6 3.8 r@xmath31 , allen 1985 ) , the above relation with @xmath83 = 1 becomes b@xmath71 @xmath6 47@xmath83@xmath87 , where b@xmath72 is in units of 100 g and @xmath87 is in units of 10@xmath88 m@xmath31 yr@xmath27 .",
    "the mass - loss rates of mid - to - late b stars are not well - determined empirically , but b @xmath16 2 g for @xmath86 = 10@xmath89 m@xmath31 yr@xmath27 ( cohen et al .",
    "1997 ) and b @xmath16 70 g for @xmath86 = 10@xmath90 m@xmath31 yr@xmath27 .",
    "the latter @xmath86 values are typical of intermediate mass herbig ae / be stars ( skinner et al . 1993 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the mcws mechanism is a potential means of explaining the high - temperature plasma in irs 1 .",
    "but , without a magnetic field detection and specific estimates of b - field strength and mass - loss parameters , any more definitive comparisons against mcws model predictions can not be made .",
    "based on the above discussion , we conclude that the high - temperature plasma at kt @xmath16 2 kev in irs 1 is most likely due to either a high - speed wind ( v@xmath73 @xmath58 1200 km s@xmath27 ) shocking onto a dense target ( e.g. a disk or dense surrounding envelope ) , or it originates in a low - mass magnetically - active yso companion .",
    "the wind - shock interpretation is plausible if irs 1 is an embedded b - type star whose wind has already turned on , and the extended bright radio continuum emission detected with the _ vla _ does point to an early - type star with a strong wind or jet .",
    "we can not rule out a magnetically - confined wind shock , but there are insufficient observational constraints on magnetic field strength and wind parameters to rigorously test mcws models .",
    "even if irs 1 is an embedded b - type star ( which seems likely ) , a lower mass yso companion at close separation could still be responsible for some ( or even all ) of the observed x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray luminosity determined from spectral models of irs 1 is at the high end of the range observed for low - mass ysos .",
    "if the x - ray emission is due entirely to a t tauri - like companion , then the known correlation between l@xmath25 and stellar mass suggests a companion mass in excess of 1 m@xmath31 .",
    "a fluorescent fe line at 6.4 kev can be produced by photoionization when `` cold '' material containing neutral or weakly - ionized iron is irradiated by a nearby hard x - ray continuum source .",
    "photons with energies above 7.11 kev are needed to eject a k - shell electron .",
    "the k - shell vacancy is filled by another electron such as an l - shell electron , resulting in fluorescent fe line emission at 6.4 kev .",
    "the line is in fact a doublet consisting of two closely - spaced lines at 6.391 kev and 6.404 kev , but these can not be distinguished at the energy resolution of the acis - i ccds .",
    "the above photoionization process is discussed in more detail by george & fabian ( 1991 ) and kallman et al .",
    "analysis of the fluorescent fe line can potentially provide information on the properties of the absorber and its location relative to the hard continuum source .",
    "the fluorescent fe line detected in irs 1 is faint ( fig .",
    "11 ) , consisting of 7 events distributed in the 6.298 - 6.536 kev energy range , with a median energy 6.395 kev and mean energy 6.419 kev .",
    "three of the seven photons arrived in the first half of the observation .",
    "a ks test applied to the arrival times of the 7 events shows no significant variability and gives a probability of constant count rate p@xmath91 = 0.35 .",
    "the line flux is 7.2 ( @xmath81.2 ) @xmath1 10@xmath62 ergs @xmath30 s@xmath27 .",
    "this is about a factor of five less than measured during the march 2005 _ xmm _ observation ( s07 ) .",
    "the line equivalent width in the acis - i spectrum is uncertain because the continuum flux near 6.4 kev is very faint .",
    "but , our flux estimates give values ew @xmath63 2.4 kev , consistent with the previous _ xmm _ estimate ( s07 ) .",
    "the detection of fluorescent fe line emission in irs 1 is a rare occurrence in ysos , but certainly not unique .",
    "tsujimoto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) examined 1616 x - ray sources detected in the deep _ chandra _ coup observation of the orion nebula cluster and identified seven sources with excess emission at 6.4 kev and line equivalent widths ew @xmath26 0.27 kev .",
    "all seven x - ray sources showed flare - like variability and high line - of - sight absorption n@xmath28 @xmath58 10@xmath29 @xmath30 , as also seen in irs 1 .",
    "the broad fluorescent fe line during a superhot flare in v1486 ori ( coup source 331 ) was analyzed by czesla & schmitt ( 2007 ) .",
    "the 6.4 kev line has also been detected in other ysos including the class i objects ylw 16a ( imanishi et al .",
    "2001 ) and elias 29 ( giardino et al .",
    "2007 ) in @xmath79 oph , and the class i source r cra x@xmath92 (= irs 7b ; hamaguchi et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the fluorescent fe line detection in irs 1 is interesting in three respects : ( i ) it was detected in the apparent absence of any large - amplitude flares ( but low - level variability may be present ) , ( ii ) there is no accompanying line at 6.7 kev from the highly - ionized fe xxv complex , and ( iii ) the line has a very large equivalent width that is difficult to account for by illuminated disk models .",
    "the absence of any detectable large flares in irs 1 is unusual because the fluorescent fe lines in almost all of the ysos mentioned above occurred during flares .",
    "analysis of the v1486 ori data showed that its broad fluorescent fe line appeared during the rise phase of a flare ( czesla & schmitt 2007 ) . an interesting exception is elias 29 , which showed a 6.4 kev line during a large flare .",
    "but the line persisted after the flare had decayed , remaining over a timescale much longer than the radiative lifetimes of fluorescent fe transitions .",
    "giardino et al .",
    "( 2007 ) thus concluded that the x - ray flare was not directly responsible the post - flare 6.4 kev line .",
    "instead , they proposed that the line was produced by collisional ionization from an unseen population of nonthermal electrons .",
    "the 6.4 kev line in irs 1 is similar to elias 29 in the sense that it does not appear to be directly associated with a large flare .",
    "the line was present in both the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum obtained in march 2005 and in the more recent _ chandra _ spectrum , but no large flare was detected in either observation .",
    "if a large flare was involved , then it must have occurred prior to the start of the observations , or it escaped detection ( as could occur if the flare occurred on the back side of irs 1 and was occulted ) .    unless large x - ray flares occurred and escaped detection , the existing data indicate that the 6.4 kev line in irs 1 is persistent and does not correlate with large flares . in that case , some mechanism needs to be operating nearly continuously to ionize the absorbing material . at present",
    ", the ionizing source and the ionization mechanism are not known .",
    "the obvious candidate for the ionizing source is irs 1 itself .",
    "but , in terms of hardness , its _ chandra _ spectrum is rather benign , showing no large flares , no fe xxv line and a weak continuum above @xmath167 kev .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility of substantial hard emission ( kt @xmath58 20 kev ) above the energy range accessible to _ chandra _ and _ xmm_. nevertheless , the intriguing possibility does remain that the hard ionizing source is not irs 1 and is not directly detected in our x - ray observations .",
    "however , before discounting irs 1 as the ionizing source , two factors should be noted .",
    "first , low - level variations appear to be present in the _ chandra _ light curve of irs 1 ( fig .",
    "these variations may be a signature of persistent low - level flaring .",
    "if that is the case , then quasi - continuous hard energy release by repeated small flares may play a role in photoionizing the absorber .",
    "second , irs 1 is thought to drive a powerful outflow and also shows evidence of a radio jet ( carrasco - gonzlez et al .",
    "if a population of nonthermal electrons is produced in the shocked jet ( which may be magnetically collimated ) they could play a role in collisional ionization of the absorber .",
    "collisional ionization has been invoked as a means of explaining the 6.4 kev line in elias 29 ( giardino et al .",
    "2007 ) and in the active binary system ii peg ( osten et al .",
    "if a population of nonthermal paricles is present , they _ may _ imprint a signature on the radio continuum emission .",
    "thus , further radio observations of irs 1 at lower frequencies where nonthermal emission can dominate over thermal ( free - free ) emission could be informative .",
    "the large equivalent width ew @xmath63 2.4 kev of the irs 1 fluorescent line is a noteworthy feature of its x - ray spectrum .",
    "this value is extreme for a yso , exceeding even the maximum value ew = 1.4 kev observed for v1486 ori during the rise phase of its superhot flare ( czesla & schmitt 2007 ) .",
    "these values conflict with theoretical models of centrally illuminated cold disks , which predict ew @xmath6 0.1 - 0.2 kev ( george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "the ew of the 6.4 kev line is proportional to the column density n@xmath93 in the fluorescing material ( tsujimoto et al .",
    "if taken literally , the large ew of irs 1 would imply a high absorber column density n@xmath93 @xmath58 10@xmath94 @xmath30 ( s07 ) .",
    "since this value is much larger than the line - of - sight photoelectric absorption inferred from the x - ray spectrum ( table 3 ) , one is led to the conclusion that the fluorescing material lies off the line - of - sight .",
    "but , the above conclusion rests on the assumption that the continuum measured in the x - ray spectrum has undergone negligible absorption .",
    "if the hard irradiating source is not irs 1 itself and is occulted or very heavily absorbed , then some or all of the intrinsic hard continuum will be missing from the observed x - ray spectrum . in that case , the ew measurement would be based on a depressed continuum and thus overestimated , along with n@xmath93 .    in summary ,",
    "our main conclusions with respect to the fluorescent fe line in irs 1 are : ( i ) the line is present even in the absence of the fe xxv line ( 6.67 kev ) and any large flare detections , and evidently does not directly depend on large - amplitude x - ray flares for its existence ,",
    "( ii ) the line flux is variable , showing a decrease between the _ xmm _ and _ chandra _ observations taken 2.6 years apart , but no significant variability during the 67 ksec _ chandra _ observation , ( iii ) the line ew is much larger than predicted by centrally - illuminated disk models , suggesting either that the photoionization models do not accurately reflect the line formation process and that other mechanisms ( e.g. collisional ionization ) could play a role , or that the observed continuum is not the same as the intrinsic continuum of the photoionizing source ( e.g. due to the effects of absorption or occultation ) , and ( iv ) the hard ionizing source may have so far escaped x - ray detection .",
    "the main conclusions of this study are the following :    1 .",
    "_ chandra _ s excellent spatial resolution has resolved the ngc 2071-ir core region into six x - ray sources .",
    "x - ray emission was detected at or near the infrared sources irs 1,2,3,4 and 6 and the radio source vla 1 .",
    "x - ray analysis shows that these sources are viewed through moderate - to - high absorption and have hard / high - temperature x - ray emission ( kt @xmath58 2 kev ) , consistent with their classification as embedded young stars . in some cases such as irs 3 ,",
    "the x - ray position is significantly offset from the near - ir position , supporting the conclusion that the near - ir peak traces nebulosity or scattered light and not the star itself .",
    "spitzer _ irac detections of irs 1,2,4,6 , and 7 provide the first reliable mid - ir colors for these objects .",
    "using irac colors along with near - ir colors based on published jhk@xmath45 photometry and the sharply - rising ir sed , we conclude that irs 1 is a class i protostar .",
    "irs 2 and irs 7 are also likely class i protostars , but could be heavily - reddened class ii objects .",
    "irs 4 and irs 6 have colors consistent with reddened class ii objects .",
    "no reliable irac photometry or mid - ir colors were obtained for irs 3 , 5 , 8 , or 8a , but near - ir colors determined from existing jhk@xmath45 photometry show that these objects are heavily - reddened .",
    "chandra _ provides the first x - ray detection of vla 1 , and its x - ray emission is likely variable .",
    "x - ray spectral models require a strong absorption component for vla 1 , equivalent to a@xmath56 = 39 [ 22 - 69 ] mag .",
    "thus , vla 1 appears to be more heavily - embedded than irs 1 and it could thus be an even younger , less - evolved object .",
    "there are as yet no ir data for vla 1 on which to base a yso classification .",
    "the existing data for irs 1 are consistent with a mid - to - late b ( proto)star classification .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of irs 1 is heavily - absorbed below 1 kev and clearly reveals high - temperature plasma at kt @xmath16 2 - 3 kev .",
    "such plasma could originate either in a shocked high - velocity wind / jet or in a magnetically - active low - mass yso companion .",
    "the most important finding of this study is that the fluorescent fe line in irs 1 is persistent and present even in the absence of large flares .",
    "thus , an as yet unidentified quasi - continuous process that operates independently of large flares is needed to explain the k - shell ionization of cold proximate material that leads to formation of fluorescent fe . both the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ light curves show signs of low - level variability , suggesting that short bursts of hard emission from persistent low - level flaring could play a role in ionizing the absorber .",
    "the large equivalent width ew @xmath63 2.4 kev of the 6.4 kev line is noteworthy because it is well in excess of values predicted by centrally illuminated disks models .",
    "large 6.4 kev line equivalent widths have also been noted in other ysos such as v1486 ori .",
    "if interpreted literally , the large ew values imply either a very high absorption column density in the cold absorber , or perhaps processes other than photoionization ( e.g. collisional ionization in shocks ) .",
    "however , some caution is needed in interpreting the large ew for irs 1 , since the absence of large flares raises the possibility that it is not the hard ionizing source .",
    "if the ionizing source is occulted by irs 1 or buried behind heavy absorption , then the hard continuum measured in the irs 1 spectrum may be less than the intrinsic continuum of the ionizing source ( `` missing continuum '' ) , leading to an overestimate of the equivalent width .",
