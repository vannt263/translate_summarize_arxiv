    "our framework is the minimal sme in weakly - curved spacetime with nonzero @xmath0 and @xmath1 coefficient fields , which is described by an action that is a combination of conventional , lorentz - symmetric terms and a set of terms @xmath2 that includes the effects of nonzero and spacetime - varying sme coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath3    to extract nonrelativistic effects , we apply the following procedure : ( 1 ) perform a field redefinition to ensure a hermitian hamiltonian , and therefore unitary time evolution .",
