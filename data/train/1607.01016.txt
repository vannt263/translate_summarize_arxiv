    "the preliminary evidence for a new resonance @xmath0 with mass around 750gev seen in the diphoton invariant - mass spectrum in the @xmath2tev lhc run by atlas and cms @xcite has raised the hopes for discovering a new sector of particle physics .",
    "if confirmed with higher statistics , this would allow for a direct exploration of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and could provide answers to the persistent questions about the stability of the electroweak scale and the origin of dark matter .",
    "the absence of signals for decay modes other than @xmath3 already provides important information about the properties of the new particle .",
    "in particular , the production and decay through sm particles can be excluded under reasonable assumptions , because the corresponding tree - level decay would completely dominate over the diphoton mode .",
    "most theoretical speculations assume that the new resonance is a singlet under the sm gauge group and carries spin 0 or 2 .",
    "the spin-2 option is interesting , as it might hint at a connection between gravity and the weak scale , which is provided e.g.  by models featuring a warped extra dimension @xcite .",
    "however , in the context of such models one would generically expect the existence of lighter states with lower spin , unless the curvature of the extra dimension is of trans - planckian size @xcite .",
    "let us suppose , then , that the new resonance @xmath0 is a gauge - singlet , spin-0 particle . since its mass is much larger than the electroweak scale , its interactions can be described in terms of local operators in the unbroken phase of the electroweak gauge symmetry . at the renormalizable level , the only interactions of @xmath0 with sm particles can arise from the higgs portals @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the higgs doublet .",
    "the coefficient @xmath6 is strongly constrained by the existing bounds on the two - particle decay modes @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which can proceed at tree level via the mass mixing of @xmath0 and @xmath10 induced by this operator , and by the bound on @xmath11 @xcite . the portal coupling @xmath12 , on the other hand , does not give rise to dangerous effects ; its phenomenology has been explored in @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a challenge to model building to find ways of suppressing the coupling @xmath6 , either by means of a symmetry or dynamically .",
    "in particular , a discrete @xmath13 symmetry under which @xmath0 changes sign would enforce @xmath14 .",
    "if the ultraviolet theory is ( at least approximately ) cp invariant , then neutral particles can be classified as cp eigenstates .",
    "if @xmath0 is a cp - odd pseudoscalar ( @xmath15 ) , then @xmath6 must be zero .",
    "a nice example of a dynamical suppression is provided by models in which @xmath0 is identified with the lowest mode of a @xmath13-odd bulk scalar field in a warped extra dimension @xcite .",
    "when the higgs sector is localized on the infrared brane , its coupling to @xmath0 is either suppressed by a small wave - function overlap or by a loop factor . here",
    "we entertain the first possibility of eliminating the portal coupling @xmath6 by supposing that @xmath0 is a cp - odd pseudoscalar , e.g.  an axion - like particle @xcite .",
    "probing the spin and the cp properties of the new resonance will be of high priority , if the diphoton excess is confirmed by further data .",
    "measurements of angular distributions in @xmath16 or @xmath17 decays have been considered @xcite , in complete analogy to the corresponding measurements in higgs decays @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the case of the higgs boson , the rates for these decays are likely to be much smaller than the diphoton decay rate , and hence it may require very large statistics to perform these analyses .    in this letter",
    "we propose the decay @xmath1 , which is strictly forbidden for a cp - even scalar , as a novel and independent way to test the spin and cp quantum numbers of the new particle .",
    "the very existence of this decay would constitute a smoking - gun signal for a pseudoscalar nature of @xmath0 ( or for significant pseudoscalar couplings , in case @xmath0 is a state with mixed cp quantum numbers ) , without the need to analyze angular distributions .",
    "the observation of this decay would also exclude a spin-2 explanation of the diphoton excess @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this signature has been overlooked in the literature so far .",
    "established experimental analyses searching for pseudoscalar particles decaying into @xmath18 in the context of two - higgs - doublet models can be adapted for the proposed search .",
    "at the level of dimension-5 operators , the most general couplings of a cp - odd scalar to gauge bosons read @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the new - physics scale , and the dots represent analogous couplings to the @xmath21 and @xmath22 gauge bosons . via this operator",
    "the resonance @xmath0 can be produced in gluon fusion at the lhc .",
    "the most general dimension-5 couplings of @xmath0 to fermions have the same form as the sm yukawa interactions times @xmath23 , and with the yukawa matrices replaced by some new matrices . in any realistic model these couplings must have a hierarchical structure in the mass basis in order to be consistent with the strong constraints from flavor physics @xcite .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that the dominant couplings are those to the third - generation quarks , which for a pseudoscalar @xmath0 and in unitary gauge can be parameterized in the form @xmath24 \\,.\\ ] ] via the second term the resonance @xmath0 can be produced in bottom - quark fusion at the lhc @xcite .",
    "when using an effective lagrangian to describe the production and decays of the resonance @xmath0 one should keep in mind that , in many new - physics scenarios addressing the diphoton anomaly , the masses of the heavy particles which are integrated out are in the tev range .",
    "otherwise it is difficult to account for the relatively large diphoton signal @xmath25fb @xcite . when there is no significant mass gap between @xmath0 and the new sector containing these particles , then contributions from operators with dimension @xmath26 are not expected to be strongly suppressed compared with those shown above .",
    "some of these operators induce new structures not present at dimension-5 level .",
    "tree - level diagrams representing the contribution of the operator in ( [ o5cand ] ) to @xmath1 decay .",
    "the internal dashed line in the third graph represents the goldstone boson @xmath27.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    the decay @xmath1 has been studied in the context of two - higgs - doublet models , where it arises at renormalizable level via the kinetic terms @xcite . however",
    ", this requires the pseudoscalar @xmath0 to be light ( since the effect vanishes in the decoupling limit ) and carry electroweak quantum numbers . for the case of a gauge - singlet scalar considered here , the effective lagrangian up to dimension  5 does not contain any polynomial operator which could mediate the decay @xmath1 at tree level . the obvious candidate @xmath28 where @xmath29 and the last expression holds in unitary gauge , can be reduced to operators containing fermionic currents using the equations of motion",
    "this is a consequence of the partial conservation of the higgs current , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the third component of weak isospin .",
    "the resulting operators are of the same form as those in ( [ cttdef ] ) and do not give rise to a tree - level @xmath1 matrix element . indeed , adding up the diagrams shown in figure  [ fig : eomgraphs ] one finds that the tree - level @xmath1 matrix element of the operator in ( [ o5cand ] ) vanishes identically , and the same is true for the @xmath32 matrix element . )",
    "was used to illustrate new - physics effects which could induce the higgs decay @xmath33 into a hypothetical , light scalar particle @xmath5 .",
    "however , we find that its contribution vanishes when all graphs shown in figure  [ fig : eomgraphs ] are included . ]",
    "importantly , however , in extensions of the sm containing heavy particles whose masses arise ( or receive their dominant contributions ) from electroweak symmetry breaking , the non - polynomial operator @xmath34 can be induced @xcite . using an integration by parts and the equations of motion , and neglecting fermionic terms which do not contribute to @xmath1 decay at tree level",
    ", this operator can be reduced to @xmath35 this gives rise to non - vanishing @xmath1 and @xmath32 matrix elements .",
    "at one - loop order , the @xmath1 decay amplitude also receives a contribution from an operator containing quark fields , and since the higgs boson couples proportional to the quark mass it suffices to consider the term involving the top quark .",
    "the complete dimension-5 lagrangian is therefore @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the third - generation left - handed quark doublet and @xmath38 .",
    "comparison with ( [ cttdef ] ) shows that the coefficient @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 .",
    "the operator @xmath41 is absent in models where the new heavy particles have masses not related to the electroweak scale .",
    "also , as we will show below , the one - loop matrix element of the operator multiplying the wilson coefficient @xmath39 is suppressed by a factor @xmath42 .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to include operators of higher dimension in the effective lagrangian . at dimension  7",
    "there is a single operator giving rise to a tree - level contribution to the @xmath1 amplitude .",
    "it reads @xmath43 which differs from the operator in ( [ beauty ] ) by a factor @xmath44 . in the second line",
    "we have again neglected operators containing fermions . at one - loop order there",
    "exist several operators contributing to the decay @xmath1 .",
    "those relevant to our analysis are @xmath45 \\\\     & \\quad\\mbox{}+ \\frac{c_{7b}^t}{m^3}\\,(\\partial^\\mu s)\\ ,      \\bar t_r\\,\\tilde\\phi^\\dagger\\gamma^\\mu\\tilde\\phi\\,t_r + \\dots \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] plus analogous operators containing the right - handed bottom quark .",
    "the dimension-6 operator proportional to @xmath46 contributes in conjunction with the operator multiplying @xmath39 in ( [ leff5 ] ) to give a contribution of order @xmath47 . below we will consider a concrete new - physics model containing heavy vector - like fermions , in which the operators shown above arise in the low - energy effective lagrangian",
    "however , we find it instructive to focus first on the contributions from the tree - level matrix elements of the operators @xmath41 and @xmath48 , and on the dimension-5 contribution induced by top - quark loops .",
    "the tree - level matrix elements of the operators @xmath41 and @xmath48 give rise to the decay amplitude @xmath49 the @xmath50 boson is longitudinally polarized , and hence the structure @xmath51 is proportional to the mass squared of the heavy singlet .",
    "the decay rate is given by @xmath52 where we have defined @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "with an @xmath55 value of the coefficient @xmath56 and a new - physics scale @xmath57tev , this partial width is of order 7gev .",
    "if @xmath56 vanishes and @xmath58 , the width is of order 7mev .",
    "the current experimental upper bound on the @xmath59 cross section times branching ratio at @xmath2tev is 73fb @xcite , which is more than an order of magnitude larger than the observed @xmath3 rate .",
    "if we assume for simplicity that the resonance is produced in gluon fusion , and that its dominant decay is into dijets ( @xmath60 ) , this upper bound translates to @xcite @xmath61 this is a rather strong bound , which suggests that the @xmath56 coefficient ( if present ) should be loop suppressed in realistic models .",
    "if @xmath56 vanishes , then the bound translates to @xmath62 . even in this latter case",
    "it is conceivable that the @xmath1 decay mode has a significantly larger rate than the diphoton mode , in which case it should be possible to observe it in the near future .",
    "top - loop contributions to @xmath1 decay .",
    "we omit a mirror copy of the first graph with a different orientation of the fermion loop and diagrams involving goldstone bosons.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    the leading dimension-5 contribution induced by top - quark loops in the low - energy effective theory arises from the second operator in ( [ leff5 ] ) , with coefficient @xmath40 .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams are shown in figure  [ fig : toploops ] .",
    "we have evaluated these diagrams in a general @xmath64 gauge .",
    "the resulting decay amplitude is @xmath65 where @xmath66 , and @xmath67 denotes the parameter integral @xmath68\\,\\frac{2m_t^2-x m_h^2-z m_z^2}{m_t^2-xz m_s^2-xy m_h^2-yz m_z^2-i0 } \\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath69\\equiv dx\\,dy\\,dz\\,\\delta(1-x - y - z)$ ] .",
    "the factor @xmath70 in ( [ ourresult ] ) ensures that analogous contributions from light fermions in the loop are negligible .",
    "evaluating the integral for @xmath71gev and with the physical higgs and @xmath50-boson masses gives @xmath72 .",
    "it is instructive to study the behavior of the function @xmath67 in more detail , neglecting for simplicity the small effects due to @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in the limit @xmath75 , we obtain @xmath76 this function is formally suppressed by a factor @xmath42 , and its real part is accidentally small .",
    "the imaginary part , on the other hand , is enlarged by a factor @xmath77 , and as a result @xmath78 is numerically of @xmath55 .",
    "if the dominant contribution to the @xmath1 decay amplitude is indeed related to the top - quark contribution proportional to @xmath39 , then we can derive a relation between the @xmath1 and @xmath9 rates .",
    "it reads @xmath79 which evaluates to @xmath80 .",
    "the present experimental upper bound on the @xmath9 rate of about 0.7pb at @xmath81tev @xcite yields @xmath82pb at 13tev under the assumption of gluon - initiated production .",
    "relation ( [ eq17 ] ) then implies @xmath83fb .",
    "it is interesting to consider the hypothetical limit where one takes the fermion mass @xmath84 in ( [ fres ] ) much larger than the mass of the resonance @xmath0 , i.e.  @xmath85 . in this case",
    "the parameter integral yields @xmath86 . the fermion is a very heavy particle , which should be integrated out from the low - energy theory .",
    "the contribution ( [ ourresult ] ) then corresponds to a matching contribution to the wilson coefficient of a local dimension-5 operator , suppressed by only a single power of @xmath20 .",
    "close inspection shows that the leading term corresponds to a matching contribution to the operator @xmath41 in ( [ obeauty ] ) .",
    "the non - polynomial structure arises because the particle integrated out ( the hypothetical heavy fermion ) receives its mass from electroweak symmetry breaking , so it is heavy only in the broken phase of the theory .",
    "the equivalent form of the operator shown in ( [ beauty ] ) can readily be mapped onto the structure of the parameter integral in ( [ fres ] ) .",
    "consider , as an illustration , a sequential fourth generation of heavy leptons , and assume that the heavy charged state @xmath87 has mass @xmath88 and a coupling @xmath89 to the pseudoscalar resonance defined in analogy to ( [ cttdef ] ) . integrating out this heavy lepton generates the contribution @xmath90 to the wilson coefficient of the operator @xmath41 .",
    "comparison with ( [ c5bound ] ) indicates that , for @xmath91 of natural size , it would be possible in this case to obtain a @xmath1 decay rate close to the present experimental upper bound .",
    "there is an interesting subtlety related to the calculation of @xmath67 worth pointing out .",
    "we have obtained the result ( [ ourresult ] ) using the naive definition of @xmath92 , such that @xmath93 .",
    "it is well know that this scheme is not consistent beyond tree level .",
    "we have thus repeated the calculation using the  thooft - veltman ( hv ) scheme @xcite , in which @xmath92 anticommutes with @xmath94 for @xmath95 , while it commutes with the remaining @xmath96 @xmath94 matrices .",
    "we then find an additional , gauge - dependent contribution to @xmath67 given by @xmath97 note the peculiar feature that in unitary gauge ( @xmath98 ) this contribution would have the effect of subtracting the leading asymptotic contribution to @xmath67 in the limit @xmath85 , leaving a result which formally corresponds to the matrix element of a dimension-7 operator .",
    "this seems to contradict the conclusion drawn above .",
    "however , it is well known that the hv scheme ( like any other consistent scheme for implementing @xmath92 in dimensional regularization ) violates the chiral ward identities of the electroweak theory @xcite . in our case , the relevant ward identity takes the form @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the proper vertex function of an on - shell @xmath0 decaying to an on - shell higgs boson and a @xmath50-boson current with momentum @xmath101 , while @xmath102 is the corresponding proper vertex function with the current replaced by the goldstone boson @xmath27 .",
    "the ward identity must be restored by means of appropriate counterterms .",
    "we find that , when this is done consistently , the counterterm contribution to the @xmath1 decay amplitude precisely cancels the extra term in ( [ delfhv ] ) , so that we recover the result obtained using the naive definition of @xmath92 .",
    "this finding should not come as a surprise . in @xcite a consistent scheme for implementing @xmath92 in dimensional regularization",
    "was proposed , which for traces involving an even number of @xmath92 matrices yields results identical to those obtained in the naive scheme with anticommuting @xmath92 .",
    "it is instructive to illustrate our findings with a concrete new - physics model , which generates the effective interactions of the scalar resonance with sm particles via loop diagrams involving heavy vector - like fermions that are mixed with the sm fermions .",
    "such a scenario is realized , e.g. , in models of partial compositeness or warped extra dimension @xcite .",

    "the terms in the last line contain the couplings to the pseudoscalar resonance @xmath0 .",
    "the mass mixing induced by the couplings @xmath107 leads to modifications of the masses and yukawa couplings of the sm top and bottom quarks by small amounts of order @xmath108 .",
    "likewise , the masses of the heavy @xmath109 and @xmath110 quarks are split by a small amount @xmath111 .    integrating out the heavy fermion doublet at tree level by solving its equations of motion",
    ", we generate the operators in the effective lagrangians ( [ leff5 ] ) and ( [ leff7 ] ) with coefficients @xmath112 and @xmath113 for @xmath114 . the coefficient @xmath115 is constrained from precision measurements of the @xmath50-boson couplings to fermions performed at lep and sld .",
    "a recent global analysis of electroweak precision tests finds @xcite @xmath116 where the pull away from zero is largely driven by the @xmath117-quark forward - backward asymmetry @xmath118 , whose experimental value is about 2.8@xmath119 smaller than the sm prediction @xcite .",

    "<S> scalar particles @xmath0 which are gauge singlets under the standard model are generic features of many models of fundamental physics , in particular as possible mediators to a hidden or dark sector . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the decay @xmath1 provides a powerful probe of the cp nature of the scalar , because it is allowed only if @xmath0 has cp - odd interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a model - independent analysis of this decay in the context of an effective lagrangian and compute the relevant wilson coefficients arising from integrating out heavy fermions to one - loop order . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our findings with the example of the 750gev diphoton resonance seen by atlas and cms and show that the @xmath1 decay rate could naturally be of similar magnitude or larger than the diphoton rate . </S>"
