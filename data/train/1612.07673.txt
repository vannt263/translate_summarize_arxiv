    "the stability of a self - gravitating gaseous disk is typically characterized by the toomre parameter , @xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath4 is the sound speed , @xmath5 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath6 is the gravitational constant and @xmath7 is the disk surface density .",
    "the disk becomes unstable to gravitational instability ( gi ) when @xmath1 is sufficiently small .",
    "this dynamical instability manifests itself as multi - armed spiral waves .",
    "the disk torques and shocks produced by these spiral structures redistribute mass and angular momentum , and ultimately help to stabilize the disk . with efficient radiative cooling or mass accretion onto the disk , gi can be maintained and leads to the collapse of regions on the spiral arms into gravitationally bound clumps .",
    "the exact condition for the development of disk gi into disk fragmentation is still an active area of research .",
    "nevertheless , it is generally agreed that a necessary condition for gi against non - axisymmetric perturbations is @xmath8 @xcite . for non - isothermal disks ,",
    "the @xmath1 criterion is not sufficient for fragmentation because fragmentation depends also on the details of the disk thermodynamics @xcite .",

    "however this mechanism does not work close to the star where the disk can not cool efficiently @xcite and the possibility of forming planets preferentially in the outer parts of the disk via disk gi has difficulty in explaining the majority of the known exoplanet population @xcite .",
    "there has been a plethora of numerical investigations ( either with smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes or grid - based finite - difference / finite - volume code ) devoted to studying various aspects of forming giant planets via disk gi , such as radiative transfer , effects of disk metallicity and chemistry , effects of numerical resolution and clump evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "most of these works assume that circumstellar disks form and exist in isolation .",
    "however , @xmath9 to @xmath10 of observed exoplanets are estimated to be in binary star systems @xcite .",
    "most models for gi involve a circular disk that surround a single star .",
    "however , perturbations to the disk , such as those due to a binary companion , can potentially aid in producing fragmentation .",
    "some studies have investigated the possibility of forming giant planets by disk gi in binary systems , but they give conflicting conclusions regarding the role played by the binary companion in the disk gi development @xcite .",
    "these papers modeled disks that are co  planar with the binary orbital plane . while disk co ",
    "planarity might be a good assumption under some circumstances , observational evidence suggests that it is not true for all binary systems .",
    "large mutual inclinations ( greater than @xmath11 ) have been observed between the circumstellar disks around young binary system components ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the binary orbital planes in these systems are unknown but at least one of the disks in each system is possibly significantly inclined ( @xmath12 ) with respect to the binary orbit .",
    "thus , it is important to understand disk gi and possible giant planet formation in inclined circumstellar disks .",
    "when the inclination of a tilted disk is greater than the critical kl angle ( of about @xmath0 ) , the disk can undergo global kozai ",
    "lidov ( kl ) oscillations @xcite .",
    "the oscillations periodically exchange the disk eccentricity and inclination , as occurs in the ballistic particle case @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we took a step further to include the effects of disk self - gravity .",
    "we found that the disk kl mechanism may be suppressed by disk self - gravity .",
    "however , the suppression `` window '' in terms of the disk mass and the disk inclination is quite narrow .",
    "the disk kl mechanism may still operate even when the disk in nearly gravitational unstable , if the inclination is large .    for disk tilts greater than about @xmath13 , the kl effect attempts to induce a large disk eccentricity that can not be fully accommodated by a smooth continuous disk .",
    "instead , the disk undergoes strong shocks during its kl oscillations .",
    "such shocks could have important consequences for disk fragmentation .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we report on finding of fragmentation triggered by the kl mechanism in the outer disk regions . in the current analysis",
    ", we assume that the disk is locally isothermal , as is more likely the case in outer disk regions , and ignore the complexities of nonisothermal effects .",

    "this binary system is initially on a circular orbit with separation @xmath28 .",
    "the total mass of the binary is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the mass of the central star and @xmath31 is the mass of the perturber star .",
    "the initial disk mass is @xmath32 , or @xmath33 of the central stellar mass , @xmath30 . in our simulations , both the central star and the perturber star can feel the gravitational force from the disk and this affects the binary orbit .",
    "however , this effect is fairly small and the binary orbit remains almost circular throughout the whole simulation .",
    "initially the orbital plane of the disk is inclined to the binary orbital plane by @xmath34 ( @xmath35 would be a co  planar disk ) .",
    "we use a locally isothermal equation of state and an explicit accretion disk viscosity . the sound speed of the disk is @xmath36 and the initial surface density distribution is @xmath37 .",
    "these are chosen such that both @xmath22 @xcite and the smoothing length @xmath38 are constant over the disk radius , @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath40 in this study , and the disk initially extends from radius @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "the initial circular velocity is corrected for the effects of disk self - gravity .",
    "the vertical gas density distribution is taken to be that for hydrostatic balance of a nonself - gravitating disk .",
    "although this initial state is somewhat out of vertical force balance due to self - gravity , this imbalance is unlikely to be responsible for the strong effects we find associated with large - scale shocks ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we treat the stars as sink particles with a boundary condition such that whenever particles move into the accretion radius they are removed from the simulation while their mass and momentum are deposited onto the sink .",
    "there are @xmath43 sph particles at the beginning of the simulation .",

    "the simulation parameters are summarized in table [ tab : params ] .",

    "for instance , if @xmath53au and @xmath54 , then both stars have mass of @xmath55 and the disk extends from @xmath56au to @xmath57au with a mass of @xmath58 .",
    "our simulation lasts for about @xmath59 binary orbits , which is about @xmath60 years . for a wider binary ,",
    "the timescale for the simulation would be longer .",
    "our simulation tool is the phantom code @xcite .",
    "we use a cubic spline kernel as the smoothing kernel .",
    "the number of neighbors is roughly constant at @xmath61 .",
    "the viscosity follows the standard sph prescription described in @xcite .",
    "a viscosity switch is implemented to reduce the artificial viscosity away from shocks @xcite . as is standard in sph codes ,",
    "we include a nonlinear term with a coefficient @xmath62 ( av stands for artificial viscosity ) in order to suppress interparticle penetration .",
    "the algorithm for the sph implementation of self - gravity in phantom is described in @xcite , where the gravitational softening length is the same as the sph kernel smoothing length @xcite .",
    "the gravitation softening length is adaptive and is approximately equal to the sph variable pressure smoothing length . to model disk fragmentation and clump formation",
    ", we use the sink particle creation feature of the code .",
    "this converts the gas particles near a local density maximum into a new sink particle",
    ". the new sink particle does not include any gravitational softening .",
    "we follow @xcite in choosing the conditions for new sink particle creation .",
    "these include checking whether the total mass within the kernel radius of the particle is at least one jeans mass , whether the velocity divergence at the particle location is negative , and whether the material which will form the new sink has both thermal energy and rotational energy less than half of its gravitational energy .",
    "to avoid checking these criteria for every local density maximum which would greatly slowdown the computation , we set a critical density above which we implement these checks .",
    "this critical density is chosen to be @xmath63 ( note that the average disk density initially is about @xmath64 ) and an accretion radius of @xmath65 is imposed around a newly - formed sink particle . if @xmath53au and @xmath54 , then the critical density is @xmath66 @xmath67 and the accretion radius is @xmath68au .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the evolution of the disk column density up to a time of about @xmath69 binary orbits .",
    "the disk orientation changes due to both orbital precession and the kl oscillations but we always show the face - on view of the disk . because of the spacial scale of the figure , the perturber star is out of the view , while the primary component is at the center of each panel .",
    "the top left panel shows that the disk is initially circular .",
    "after about @xmath70 binary orbits , the disk remains circular but the perturber star has driven spiral waves in the disk . in the top right panel which is at @xmath71 ,",
    "the disk starts to show some eccentricity and a relatively strong one - arm spiral shock . at @xmath72 ( bottom left panel )",
    ", the disk has clearly become more eccentric and the spiral shock has evolved into an arc - like shocked region with material being even more concentrated along that arc . shortly after , at a time of @xmath73 ( bottom middle panel ) , the first clump forms ( denoted by the black dot ) . a second clump forms shortly after this as shown in the last panel at time @xmath74 . both clumps have mass of around @xmath75 .",
    "this makes them about @xmath76 objects if we take the binary mass to be @xmath77 .",
    "they form at a radius of @xmath78 , where the local disk @xmath1 value is now about @xmath79 . by comparison ,",
    "the local disk @xmath1 value on the other side of the disk ( also @xmath80 ) is almost ten times higher ( @xmath81 ) .    in figure [ fig : fig2 ] we show the time evolution of the eccentricity and inclination of the disk at three different radii from the central star .",
    "the left column shows the run presented in figure [ fig : fig1 ] where disk self - gravity is included .",
    "the right column , in contrast , shows a simulation without disk self - gravity ( and thus no disk fragmentation ) while all the other simulation parameters are the same .",
    "the left column demonstrates that disk fragmentation occurs when the disk eccentricity has grown up to almost @xmath82 . at this stage ,",
    "the disk is still fairly early in its kl cycle so that the disk inclination has only declined slightly .",
    "if there is no fragmentation ( see right column ) , then we see an interrupted disk kl oscillation during which disk eccentricity can grow up to about @xmath83 while the disk inclination falls to about @xmath84 .",
    "notice that in both simulations the disk remains quite flat throughout the simulation ( see the similarity of disk inclination at the three different radii plotted ) .",
    "the kl cycle in the run including self  gravity starts at an earlier time than the one without self  gravity .",
    "this is because the initial driving of disk kl oscillation is very sensitive to initial model setup .",
    "even slightly different initially conditions could lead to significantly different lengths of the pre - kl stage ( as discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "notice also that the disk eccentricity in the beginning is slightly higher than zero even though we set the disk up to be circular .",
    "this is due to the fact that we assume the sph particles are on keplerian orbits when computing their orbital eccentricities whereas they are actually on slightly sub - keplerian orbits because of the disk pressure @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we presented a simulation that is the same as the one in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , except that the disk initial tilt was @xmath85 , as opposed to @xmath86 here .",
    "a disk with initial tilt of @xmath85 still undergoes kl oscillations , but the oscillation amplitudes are smaller ( the peak disk eccentricity is about @xmath87 ) .",
    "there are two reasons for the weakened kl cycle in this case .",
    "first , the disk self - gravity acts to suppress the disk kl mechanism @xcite .",
    "secondly , even without self - gravity , the disk kl oscillation amplitude is in general smaller for lower initial disk tilt ( see for example figure 10 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the @xmath88 inclination case ,",
    "the disk still becomes eccentric and looks similar to the first four panels of figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "however , the eccentricity growth is not strong enough for the shock front to be sufficiently dense to trigger disk fragmentation .",
    "we have also investigated two other cases that are not shown .",
    "we find that a coplanar disk does not show disk fragmentation because the kl mechanism does not operate .",
    "furthermore , for a lower disk mass , @xmath89 , the disk @xmath1 value is too high for fragmentation to occur .",
    "all of these results confirm that the disk fragmentation we see in figure [ fig : fig1 ] is caused by disk gi that is triggered by strong eccentricity growth from disk kl cycle .",
    "it does not happen if the disk tilt is low which means either weak or completely no kl oscillation , at least for the disk mass ( @xmath33 of the mass of the hosting star ) we focus on in this study .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we have shown that global kl oscillations in an inclined massive disk around one component of a binary system can facilitate the disk gi and fragmentation .",
    "for example , a disk of mass @xmath58 around a @xmath55 star can form multiple dense clumps of mass @xmath90 on a timescale of about 6 binary orbits .",
    "this kind of disk fragmentation can occur even when the disk does not typically have a very small @xmath1 value ( e.g. @xmath91 ) .",
    "thus , the same disk in isolation is fairly stable .",
    "it does require , however , that the disk initially has a high enough tilt so that a strong kl  driven disk eccentricity growth can be achieved .",
    "there are three previous papers that have simulated disk instability and fragmentation in binary star systems @xcite .",
    "they reach different conclusions regarding whether or not a binary companion helps disk fragmentation in the co  planar disk case .",
    "the discrepancy of their results is probably due to differences in the simulation techniques ( sph code or grid - based code ) , numerical resolution , equation of state or binary orbit parameters @xcite .",
    "compared to these previous works , our disk is less massive ( the minimum @xmath92 ) and quite stable against gi without the binary companion .",
    "the disks in these three papers are just marginally stable ( the minimum @xmath93 ) . in these papers",
    ", it generally takes a few hundred years to see disk fragmentation , if there is indeed binary companion induced disk instability . in our simulation , the disk fragments after it has gained enough eccentricity . in these papers ,",
    "the disk is still quite circular at the time of fragmentation .",
    "we have taken the disk to behave isothermally .",
    "this condition makes fragmentation occur more easily than it would in a disk that responds adiabatically due to increased resistance to compression @xcite .",
    "self - gravitating disks in binaries can be stabilized against fragmentation as a result of the extra heating associated with the perturbation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , possible nonisothermal effects are important to include in the analysis .    we have adopted a binary separation of 100au .",
    "a wider binary of a few hundred au or more would permit the disk to be truncated at larger radii @xcite , greater than about 40 au , where a disk is more amenable fragmentation because the optical depth is closer to unity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". the kl oscillation timescale would be longer in a wider binary , but could still shorter than the disk lifetime .",
    "because our code simply treats newly formed clumps as sink particles , we are not able to study the internal evolution of these dense objects and interactions between sink particles ( e.g. merging of two clumps ) . in our study , we intentionally stop the simulation shortly after the formation of the first one or two clumps , even though the code can still proceed with formation of even more clumps .",
    "it is not our goal to follow the full path of the formation , evolution of any disk clump .",
    "that requires a much more sophisticated numerical investigation which is beyond the scope of this study . whether these disk fragments can remain as gravitationally bound objects and what their final distributions are deserve to be the subject of future investigations",
    "we have concentrated on kl fragmentation of protostellar disks .",
    "other disk environments that are subject to fragmentation around a single object may experience enhanced fragmentation conditions in a noncoplanar binary environment through the kl effect . for example",
    ", fragmentation may occur in a disk around a massive black hole @xcite .",
    "kl - induced shocks may expedite such fragmentation involving binary black hole systems with small separations where the binary mass dominates .",
