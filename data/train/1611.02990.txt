    "we have determined all entropy - producing cycles . to make progress",

    "the best result is obtained for 3 communities followed by a slightly lower value for 5 communities . ]",
    "we can turn these insights into a more quantitative statement by partitioning the cycle space into @xmath9 communities . to this end",
    "we employ an implementation of the fuzzy @xmath66-means algorithm ( an implementation is available in ref .  ) , which assigns to each cycle a probability for belonging to a specific community .",
    "first , we normalize all three features ( cycle diameters , cycle centers , and affinities ) by their variance to make them comparable .",
    "these features are then used as an input for the fuzzy c - means clustering algorithm returning membership degrees @xmath67 which express the probability that observation @xmath32 belongs to community @xmath68 . to obtain an indicator of",
    "how good the clustering results are we compute the fuzzy partition coefficient ( fpc ) that is defined as the frobenius norm of the membership matrix @xmath69 here @xmath9 is the number of chosen communities and @xmath70 the number of observations ( cycles in our case ) .",
    "the closer the fpc gets to one the better the cycle space can be partitioned into the chosen number of clusters .",
    "the advantage of fuzzy partitioning is that some cycles might not belong to any cycle community while others match well in multiple ones .",
    "the minimal number of cycle communities to account for the collective folding and unfolding dynamics is @xmath71 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cyc]e ) , but to capture the full dynamics we found @xmath72 cycle communities to be more appropriate .",
    "we identify three local communities colored in blue , green , and red , as well as two global communities colored in magenta and cyan , see fig .  [",
    "fig : cyc]a , b .",
    "the blue community represents cycles that correspond to globular configurations while the green and red communities represent similar dynamics for intermediate and fully stretched configurations , respectively .",
    "the global cycle communities connect two ( cyan ) or all three ( magenta ) local communities .",
    "next , we replace each cycle community by one cycle that we will refer to as _ representative _  @xcite .",
    "we find appropriate representatives by mapping mean first - passage times between states that belong to different local cycle communities . after selecting representatives",
    ", we delete all states not belonging to any of the representatives and rescale the remaining transition rates with restrictions that : the total entropy production rate @xmath73 , all remaining cycle affinities @xmath74 and all remaining edge affinities @xmath75 are preserved .",
    "for details see ref .   and appendix  [ sec : repr ] .",
    "at this stage the coarse - grained msm still contains many states since a single cycle can traverse hundreds of states .",
    "the important point is , however , that the coarse - grained model lost much of its original complexity as it now contains only a few cycles .",
    "we can thus further reduce the number of states . to this end",
    "we identify two dominant motifs , which we refer to as bridge and triangle states .",
    "both motifs build on states that have exactly two neighbors . for bridge states",
    "the neighbors are not connected to each other  @xcite .",
    "triangle states complete cycles that do not exhibit positive entropy productions and thus are not part of the decomposition eq .  .",
    "we iteratively search and remove these states ( for details see appendix  [ sec : bridge ] ) until no more are found , which completes our coarse - graining scheme .",
    "( a )  transition network of the polymer dynamics with 15 centroids ( filled circles ) and 5 cycles .",
    "the colored states green , blue , and red correspond to the colors of the local cycle communities shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cyc ] . states with a black border are structurally very similar and constitute the transition ensemble . the arrows point in the direction of probability currents ( net flux ) , while the arrow widths represent the magnitude of currents . on average ,",
    "the polymer dynamics follows the direction of the arrows .",
    "arrow colors cyan and magenta correspond to the global cycles .",

    "symbols are the configurations while lines indicate the cycles with the arrows pointing in the direction of the net flux . ]",

    "[ fig : tnetwork]a . after removing the bridge and triangle",
    "states the transition network contains 15 states ( centroids ) .",
    "the collective rates for folding and unfolding of this coarse - grained model agree with those obtained from the bd simulations by construction .",
    "moreover , the remaining five cycles now allow for detailed insights into the relevant pathways in non - equilibrium .",
    "the three local cycles are composed of three states , the minimal number for a non - trivial , entropy - producing cycle .",
    "the red and blue cycle connect stable globular and stretched configurations , respectively .",
    "the green cycle represents a metastable intermediate of half - stretched configurations that do not unfold correctly but quickly fold back to the intermediate .",
    "the global cyan cycle also contains half - stretched configurations ( structurally similar to the green cycle ) but here the unfolding reaches the final stretched states before returning to their half - stretched origin .",
    "finally , the magenta cycle represents the full transition from globule to stretched configurations and back .",
    "the five states @xmath76 describing intermediate , half - stretched configurations are very close in configuration space ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tnetwork]b ) .",
    "they constitute the analog of the transition ensemble through which the folding / unfolding has to proceed . in non - equilibrium , however , the folding and unfolding processes follow different paths through this narrow region of configuration space .",
    "the globule to half - stretched transition proceeds along @xmath77 ( with state 4 belonging to the green cycle ) whereas the reverse half - stretched to globule transition proceeds along @xmath78 , with states 13 and 14 belonging to the cyan cycle .",
    "the cycle topology thus reveals the dynamical trapping of the polymer in an intermediate , which can not be captured by structural information alone .",
    "employing order parameters like distances in configuration space or lifetimes to identify mesostates will clearly miss this important feature of cyclic non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "another question that we can address is dissipation , the role of which for bio - processes has been investigated recently , _",
    "e.g. _ , for self - replication  @xcite and in the activation of signaling proteins  @xcite .",
    "the rate of dissipated heat @xmath79 created in each cycle community is proportional to their respective entropy production rate @xmath80 .",
    "our analysis reveals that both the blue and red cycles are equally responsible for about 30% of the total dissipated heat , while the green , cyan , and magenta communities produce 5% , 15% , and 50% , respectively .",
    "the latter is caused by the large conformational changes ( folding and unfolding process ) of the polymer .",
    "the blue and red cycles , on the other hand , do not exhibit large conformational changes , therefore , the conformational changes must be on very short timescales , which is confirmed by the large probability currents shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : tnetwork]a .",
    "we finally comment on using a pca , which is not necessarily the best method to reduce the dimensionality of configuration space , and more advanced methods such as the time - lagged independent correlation analysis exist  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is common practice to first apply a dimensionality reduction to the continuous molecular dynamics ( or bd ) data and subsequently discretize the reduced configuration space into finite sets .",
    "we did not follow this approach because ne - msms built from reduced configuration space exhibit a significantly lower entropy production rate than ne - msms built from full configuration space ( assuming the same number of centroids is used ) .",
    "recent results  @xcite suggest that the fluctuations of general currents are bounded by the entropy production , which directly links dynamic with thermodynamic consistency .",
    "to conclude , we have presented a general method to systematically construct coarse - grained models composed of a few discrete states from molecular data of steadily driven systems .",
    "specifically , we have studied the globule - stretch transition of a simple model polymer , but the method can in principle be applied to more realistic and complex molecules ( such as f@xmath81-atpase  @xcite ) , delivering minimal and thermodynamically consistent markov state models .",
    "while these models can be employed to bridge time scales , they also allow insights into the relevant transition pathways . here",
    "we have shown that different directions can pass through the same region of configuration space , which we believe might be a general property of transitions in driven systems .",
    "we thank f. schmid for helpful comments .",
    "we acknowledge financial support by the dfg through the collaborative research center trr 146 ( project a7 ) .",
    "the configuration space is discretized by employing the popular @xmath9-means clustering algorithm which divides the continuous configuration space into @xmath9 volumes and returns their centroids ( center of each volume ) .",
    "next the bd trajectories are projected onto the centroids , storing its dynamical information as simple sequences of centroid indices .",
    "we extract the dynamical information by counting the number of transitions @xmath82 for a given lag time @xmath83 ( time in between transitions ) .",
    "the count matrix @xmath84 is used to approximate the transition matrix @xmath85 by @xmath86 which is also the maximum probability estimator for the true transition operator  @xcite .",
    "we additionally require @xmath87 to have two important properties : first , @xmath87 must be ergodic , i.e. each state can be reached from every other state in finite time or the transition network spanned by @xmath87 is connected .",
    "second , all occurring transitions are reversible , i.e. if @xmath88 then @xmath89 .    . ]",
    "if the process described by @xmath87 is time - homogeneous its entries @xmath90 are ought to be time - independent . to test this",
    "we perform a lag time analysis  @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ lagtime_analysis ] . for equilibrium systems",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath91 of the transition matrix @xmath87 can be converted into relaxation timescales of the system @xmath92 with slowest modes corresponding to the largest @xmath91 .",
    "if the largest eigenvalues are time - independent , also the slowest modes are time - independent yielding a good estimation of the minimal lag time that can be used . in ne - msm",
    "the eigenvalues can become complex , which leaves their physical interpretation still open for discussion .",
    "however , for the polymer dynamics the largest eigenvalues sorted by either their real part or absolute value exhibit no imaginary part .    for a continuous - time markov process with rate matrix @xmath93 , the transition probability can be expressed as @xmath94 .",
    "while conventional markov state models have discrete - time dynamics , for our purposes we require a rate matrix , which we approximate from the computed transition matrix through @xmath95 all off - diagonal elements of @xmath93 are non - negative @xmath96 while the diagonal elements are @xmath97 . following the perron - frobenius theorem , @xmath87 and thus @xmath93",

    "the sum adds the cycle weights of all cycles containing the edge @xmath39 . for the cycle decomposition",
    "we start by dividing @xmath101 into a symmetric detailed - balance part @xmath104 and a non - negative current part @xmath105 so that @xmath106 here @xmath105 is obtained by @xmath107 with all negative elements set to zero .",

    "general considerations  @xcite show that the maximum number of needed non - trivial cycles is bounded by @xmath118 with @xmath119 being the number of non - zero elements of @xmath105 and @xmath120 its rank .",

    "any appropriate set of representatives needs to preserve mfpt@xmath125 and mfpt@xmath126 .",
    "especially , the conservation of mfpts is of particular importance as it ensures the coarse - grained msm to express the correct timescales .",
    "so far no determinstic algorithm exists that returns a reliable set of representatives . for this reason we formulate a stochastic algorithm that picks candidates for cycle representatives randomly and checks for ergodicity and mfpts .",
    "the algorithm is outlined as follows :    1 .",
    "choose one representative per cycle community by drawing a random number .",
    "2 .   check if set of representatives span ergodic transition network . if yes , compute coarse - grained msm , else go back to step ( 1 ) .",
