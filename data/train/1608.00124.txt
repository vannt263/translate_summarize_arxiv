    "<S> conclusions. _ we have illustrated an ancilla - assisted protocol for work extraction that takes advantage of the sharing of quantum correlations between a system and an ancilla that is subjected to suitably chosen projective measurements . </S>",
    "<S> our approach allowed us the introduce of a new form of information - enhanced ergotropy , which we have dubbed daemonic , that acts aptly as a witness for quantum correlations in general , and serves as a necessary and sufficient criterion for separability of bipartite pure states . </S>",
    "<S> we have characterised fully the distribution of quantum correlated two - qubit states with respect to the figure of merit set by the daemonic ergotropy , finding that quantum correlations embody a proper resource for the work - extraction performances of the states that minimize @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our work opens up interesting avenues for the thermodynamic interpretation of quantum correlations , clarifies their resource - role in ancilla - assisted information thermodynamics and opens up possibilites to understand the role of correlations in the charging power of quantum batteries @xcite .    _ </S>",
