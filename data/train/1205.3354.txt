    "the existence of virtual electron - positron pair fluctuations in quantum electrodynamical ( qed ) vacuum allows its description as a material medium with dielectric properties .",
    "the virtual electron - positron pair fluctuations give rise to polarization and magnetization currents which depend on the intensity of the external field similar to nonlinear optics .",
    "hence , the qed vacuum is nonlinear in applied external electromagnetic fields , however , the nonlinearity is weak even in super - strong fields available in labs .",
    "an important property of this conception is the photon - photon interaction which is predicted to happen in qed vacuum in external super - strong electromagnetic fields in analogy with a kerr - like optical medium @xcite .",
    "direct observation of photon - photon scattering is of great scientific importance and several suggestions for the measurement of this phenomenon have been put forward up to now .",
    "the attempts to observe photon - photon scattering with strong laser fields @xcite were only able to determine the upper limit of the cross section . to enhance the cross section , a third laser beam can be applied to stimulate the photon emission at photon - photon scattering @xcite .",
    "the possibility of photon - photon scattering with modern strong laser beams is analyzed in @xcite including four - wave mixing process @xcite in analogy with nonlinear optics .",
    "however , in spite of a long - standing experimental challenge no efforts have led to actual detection of photon - photon scattering among real photons . recently",
    ", strong field laser technique is advancing rapidly , in particular , aimed at the laser fusion program @xcite . the extreme light infrastructure ( eli )",
    "@xcite is under development which will provide unprecedented strong laser fields with intensities reaching up to @xmath0 w/@xmath1 .",
    "these techniques are opening a door for new theoretical and experimental investigations of vacuum polarization effects @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the next generation high - power laser systems will enable intensity regimes where the photon - photon interaction may be directly observable .",
    "usually strong fields are produced with a tight focusing of a laser beam . in this respect , the strong field amplitudes",
    "are essentially nonuniform .",
    "several recent works analyze the consequences of the vacuum nonuniform polarization . among these",
    "we note the investigation of diffraction and interference effects due to the vacuum nonuniform polarization in strong focused laser beams @xcite . in analogy with nonlinear optics",
    ", it is expected that coherent spatial effects in qed vacuum could be also realized . in this regard , a new phenomenon ",
    "bragg scattering of light in vacuum structured by strong periodic fields ( magnetic or laser ) have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that bragg scattering setup provides an enhancement of the number of scattered photons with respect to the stimulated photon - photon scattering by a factor proportional to the square of the number of grating periods within the interaction region .    in this paper",
    ", we continue investigation of coherent spatial vacuum effects in photon - photon interaction in a setup of multiple crossed superstrong laser beams .",
    "the previous consideration @xcite was devoted to investigation of elastic photon - photon bragg scattering .",
    "generally , it is difficult to distinguish qed scattered photons with wavelengths close to that of the incoming laser beams in standard schemes .",
    "however , in our scheme of elastic photon - photon scattering the bragg effect facilitates the observation because the bragg interference arising at a specific impinging direction of the probe wave concentrates the scattered light in the specular direction . here",
    "we propose an alternative approach employing general properties of four - wave mixing processes in structured qed vacuum .",
    "in addition to elastic process , we analyze possibilities for observation of vacuum polarization effects using inelastic photon - photon scattering processes .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the nonlinear equations accounting for the cubic - order qed vacuum polarization effects . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the intensity of output light in four - wave mixing processes if the incoming wave vectors satisfy the phase - matching conditions . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the phase - matching condition and coherent effects in inelastic photon - photon scattering .",
    "we consider scattering of probe light beam by a periodic spatial bragg structure that is formed by a set of n focused laser beams propagating parallel to each other , see , fig . 1 ( b ) .",
    "the photon - photon interaction is described in qed by the box feynman diagram , see fig .",
    "1 ( a ) , according to which the interaction of two incoming photons produces two new outgoing photons , with photon energies and momenta fulfilling the conservation laws .",
    "one of the incoming photons belongs to a probe laser beam and the second one to the modulated structure of strong parallel laser beams .",
    "the scattered photon comprises the one of outgoing waves and the strong laser wave contributing to the second outgoing wave .",
    "thus , this process can be also considered as a four wave - mixing in which interaction of three beams leads to generation of output mode satisfying resonance conditions between the frequencies and wave - vectors . in the presence of the amplitude modulation of the strong laser field",
    ", the probe beam can be reflected by the periodic structure due to bragg scattering which corresponds to the elastic scattering of the photons of the probe beam @xcite . in the following , we consider the general case of the bragg scattering of probe photons which can be as elastic ( one laser photon is absorbed and one laser photon emitted ) as well as inelastic ( two laser photons are absorbed or emitted ) .",
    "the photon - photon interaction is a perturbation and we assume that it does not modify significantly the dispersion relation for laser and probe waves .",
    "we start from the maxwell wave equations for the electric field in the presence of the vacuum polarization @xmath2 and magnetization @xmath3 @xmath4 where the current density @xmath5 is determined by the vacuum polarization @xmath2 and magnetization @xmath3 : @xmath6 the vacuum polarization and magnetization in the third order nonlinear corrections are derived from the heisenberg euler effective lagrangian @xcite : @xmath7,\\ ] ] @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 units are used throughout the paper .",
    "bellow , we derive the nonlinear wave equation for the output field ( scattered light in fig .",
    "1 ) , considering the current in the first - order of the probe plane wave @xmath10 and in the second - order of the composite field @xmath11 which describes the set of parallel laser beams . the coupling constants in the current density may be interpreted in terms of the nonlinear susceptibility of the vacuum . choosing the total electric and magnetic fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 in eqs .",

    "the incoming wave is chosen to be a plane wave with an amplitude having a weak space - time dependence due to interaction @xmath16 in accordance to the discussion above , the square of the driving composite laser fields can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 describes the spatial modulation of the intensity and @xmath19 the phase modulation ( @xmath20 ) . using eqs.(2)-(8 ) , the current is calculated @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 with @xmath24 , the electron charge and mass @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , and @xmath27\\bigg[\\textbf{e}_{0}+\\bigg(\\bigg(\\hat{k}_{1}-i\\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla } f}{k_{1}f}\\bigg)\\times\\textbf{b}_{0}\\bigg)\\bigg]+\\nonumber\\\\ 7[{(\\textbf{e}_{1}\\textbf{b}_{0}})+((\\hat{k}_{1}\\times\\textbf{e}_{1})\\textbf{e}_{0})]\\bigg[\\textbf{b}_{0}-\\bigg(\\bigg(\\hat{k}_{1}-i\\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla } f}{k_{1}f}\\bigg)\\times\\textbf{e}_{0}\\bigg)\\bigg].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] only the resonant terms including the factors @xmath28 and @xmath29 are kept in the current .",
    "all other terms will be cancelled when averaging over a short space - time interval due to rapid oscillations .",
    "in this section we calculate the intensity of light generated by the resonant four - wave interaction . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the wave equation ( 1 ) for the output field @xmath30 with a cubic nonlinear current of eq .",
    "the solution to the wave equation in the radiation zone takes the form of a spherical outgoing wave multiplied by a phase - matching function as well as by the photon polarization matrix element .",
    "the phase - matching function is peaked at the resonant values of the wave vector @xmath31 .",
    "we present the final result for elastic photon scattering when frequencies of the probe and the output fields are the same @xmath32 , as well as the result for inelastic scattering @xmath33 which takes place with absorption or emission of additional photons @xmath34 from the set of parallel lasers .",
    "we also average the current over the fast oscillations of nonresonant terms which do not fulfill the phase - matching condition . for the elastic scattering this procedure leads to the replacement @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) , yielding for the electric field @xmath36 where the integration is carried out over the interaction region , and the current is evaluated at the retarded time @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath31 and @xmath39 is the radius - vector of the observation point .",
    "thus , in the case of elastic scattering , we obtain @xmath40 in the case of inelastic scattering , the factor of @xmath41 modifies the resonant terms and the radiated field is calculated as follows @xmath42 it corresponds to two configurations with absorption or emission of laser photons which fulfill the energy conservation : @xmath43    we calculate the intensity of the scattered field within a solid angle @xmath44 : @xmath45 , summing over polarization of the scattered photons @xmath46 .",
    "the intensity of generated mode during elastic photon scattering reads @xmath47 while for the inelastic case reads as @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the phase - mismatch function in the case of elastic scattering and @xmath51 in the case of inelastic scattering . in eqs .",
    "( [ iel ] ) and ( [ iinel ] ) , @xmath52 depends from polarization states of the probe and of the driving fields .",
    "we see that the efficiency of the scattering is determined by the fourier transformation of the intensity distribution of the driving strong laser field which forms bragg grating .",
    "the distribution function @xmath18 for @xmath53 parallel laser beams reads @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the period of the bragg structure and @xmath56 is the distribution function of the single laser beam .",
    "the latter is chosen in a form of an elliptical gaussian beam @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the beam waist sizes .",
    "after the integration over the interaction region , we have for the phase - mismatch function @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the interaction length in the @xmath61-direction and @xmath62 is the dirac delta - function .",
    "taking into account that @xmath63 the phase - mismatch function reads @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the unit vector along the @xmath67-axis and @xmath68 is an integer number .",
    "the phase - mismatch function @xmath69 generates the phase - matching bragg condition @xmath70 the exponential damping factor in eq .",
    "( [ pp ] ) determines the maximal value for @xmath71 .",
    "taking into account the bragg condition eq .",
    "( [ bragg ] ) , the damping factor restricts the harmonic number @xmath72 .",
    "the total intensity of the scattered radiation , integrated over the solid angle , equals : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the interaction time .",
    "the total intensity is proportional to the interaction 4-volume @xmath75 as well as to the number of periods in the bragg structure @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the lattice structure of a medium can significantly ( @xmath76 ) enhance the intensity of the scattered light due to interference of the scattered light generated from different layers of the structure ( bragg scattering ) [ 16 ] .",
    "note that the bragg concept is quite general and is applied not only in optics [ 17 ] but also in quantum optics [ 18 ] , atom optics [ 19 ] and for matter waves [ 20 ] .",
    "in this section , we analyze the phase - matching condition of eq .",
    "( [ bragg ] ) in the case of inelastic four - wave mixing , with the energy conservation given by eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) .",
    "let us express both of the above equations via 4-vectors : @xmath77 with @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , and find the phase - matching condition for the impinging angle of the probe wave , see fig .",
    "2 . taking into account that @xmath81 , we find from the squaring of eq .",
    "( [ 4-vector ] ) : @xmath82 the latter yields to a quadratic equation for @xmath83 : @xmath84 this equation will have a solution when @xmath85 and it reads @xmath86 usually , the distance between the laser beams in the bragg structure should be larger than the waist size of the beam : @xmath87 , from which it follows that @xmath88 .",
    "for example , considering @xmath89 and @xmath90 [ in which case @xmath91 , the condition of eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) is fulfilled , i.e. the phase - matching is possible to fullfill , and eq .",
    "( [ tg ] ) yields for the probe impinging angle @xmath92 , see fig .",
    "2 . in the chosen geometry",
    ", the scattered wave has larger frequency and emission direction significantly varying from the probe direction .",
    "we have studied scattering of probe laser beam on the set of parallel focused laser that constitutes a bragg grating .",
    "both processes of elastic and inelastic four wave - mixing in structured qed vacuum accompanied with bragg interference are investigated . in the case of elastic scattering of photons ,",
    "when the frequencies of the probe wave @xmath93 and the scattered wave @xmath94 are the same , the phase - matching condition is met at @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the vector of the lattice . while , for inelastic light scattering with absorption or emission of additional laser photons i.e. for the processes @xmath97 , or @xmath98 , the phase - matching condition is accordingly modified @xmath99 .",
    "when the phase - matching condition is fulfilled , the scattering probability is enhanced due to bragg interference over the incoherent one by a factor @xmath53 of the number of periods in the grating . while in the elastic scattering process",
