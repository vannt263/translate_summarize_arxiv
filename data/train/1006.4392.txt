    "dengue is a mosquito - borne infection , transmitted by the _ aedes aegytpi _ mosquito , that causes a severe flu - like illness , and sometimes a potentially lethal complication called dengue haemorrhagic fever .",
    "dengue is found in tropical and sub - tropical climates worldwide , mostly in urban and semi - urban areas . according to the world health organization @xcite ,",
    "the incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades .",
    "about 40% of world s population are now at risk .",
    "the aim of the paper is to present a mathematical model to study the dynamic of the dengue epidemics , in order to minimize the investments in disease s control , since the financial resources are always scarce .",
    "quantitative methods are applied to the optimization of investments in the control of the epidemiologic disease , in order to obtain a maximum of benefits from a fixed amount of financial resources .",
    "the used model depends on the dynamic of the growing of the mosquito , but also on the efforts of the public management to motivate the population to break the reproduction cycle of the mosquitoes by avoiding the accumulation of still water in open - air recipients and spraying potential zones of reproduction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec:2 ] presents the dynamic model for dengue epidemics , where the variables , parameters , and ordinary differential equations describing the control system , are defined . in section  [ sec:3 ] the numerical implementation and the strategies used to solve the problem",
    "are shown .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] reports the obtained numerical results .",
    "the main conclusions are then given in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the dengue epidemic model described in this paper is based on the one proposed in @xcite .",
    "it consists in minimizing @xmath0 = \\int_{0}^{t_f}\\{\\gamma_d x_{3}^{2}(t ) + \\gamma_f u_{1}^{2}(t)+\\gamma_e u_{2}^{2}(t)\\}dt\\ ] ] subject to the following four nonlinear time - varying state equations @xcite : @xmath1x_1(t)-u_1(t ) , \\label{x1}\\ ] ] @xmath2x_2(t)+\\beta \\left [ x_1(t)-x_2(t)\\right]x_3(t)-u_1(t ) , \\label{x2}\\ ] ] @xmath3 , \\label{x3}\\ ] ] @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",

    "the dynamics of the infectious transmission is presented in equation ( [ x3 ] ) .",

    "the factor @xmath40 $ ] is the number of individuals in the area , that are not infected .",
    "equation ( [ x4 ] ) is a model for the level of popular motivation ( or goodwill ) to combat the reproductive cycle of mosquitoes . along the time , the level of people s motivation changes . as a consequence ,",
    "it is necessary to invest in educational campaigns designed to increase consciousness of the population under risk .",
    "the expression @xmath41 represents the decay of the people s motivation with time , due to forgetting . the expression @xmath42 represents the natural sensibilities of the public due to increase in the prevalence of the disease .",
    "the goal is to minimize the cost functional ( [ cost ] ) .",
    "this functional includes the social costs related to the existence of ill individuals , @xmath43 , the recourses needed for spraying of insecticides operations , @xmath44 , and for educational campaigns , @xmath45 .",
    "the model for the social cost is based on the concept of goodwill explored by nerlove and arrow @xcite .    due to computational issues ,",
    "the optimal control problem ( [ cost])-([x4 ] ) , that is written in the lagrange form , was converted into an equivalent mayer problem .",
    "hence , using a standard procedure ( , , @xcite ) to rewrite the cost functional , the state vector was augmented by an extra component @xmath46 , @xmath47 leading to the following equivalent terminal cost problem : to minimize @xmath48=x_5(t_f),\\ ] ] with given @xmath49 , subject to the control system ( [ x1])-([x4 ] ) and ( [ newx5 ] ) .",
    "the simulations were carried out using the following normalized numerical values : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "these values are available in the paper @xcite and were adopted here in order to be able to compare the obtained results with those of @xcite .",
    "it was considered as final time @xmath68 weeks .",
    "two different implementations were considered . in the first one ,",
    "a direct approach was followed through the use of the optimal control solver . in the second case , with the employment of a nonlinear solver in mind , it was necessary to discretize the optimal control problem into a standard nonlinear programming problem .",
    "the @xcite , _ optimal control of ordinary - differential equations _ , is a collection of routines for optimal control problems subject to ordinary differential equations .",
    "it uses an automatic direct discretization method and includes procedures for numerical adjoint estimation and sensitivity analysis . in our case",
    "the formulation used is optimal control problem ( [ x1])-([x4 ] ) and ( [ newx5])-([x5tf ] ) .",
    "the @xcite , _ interior point optimizer _ , is a software package for large - scale nonlinear optimization .",
    "it is written in and .",
    "implements a primal - dual interior point method and uses a line search strategy based on filter method . can be used from various modeling environments . in this work ,",
    "the problem was coded in @xcite and interfaced to .",
    "for the nonlinear strategy , we had to discretize the problem ourselves .",
    "it was selected a first order method : the euler s scheme @xcite .",
    "higher order discretization schemes can also be considered , but bringing no advantage @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the time @xmath69 moves ahead in uniform steps of length @xmath70 .",
    "so , if a differential equation is written like @xmath71 , it is possible to make a convenient approximation of this :    l @xmath71 +   + @xmath72 +   + @xmath73 .",
    "this approximation @xmath74 of @xmath75 at the point @xmath76 has an error of order @xmath77 .",
    "so it is important to use small enough steps , in order to obtain an accurate solution , in spite of allowing a computational efficient scheme .",
    "the value @xmath78 was found to be a good compromise between precision and efficiency , and was adopted here .",
    "thus , the optimal control problem was discretized into the following nonlinear programming problem :    lll minimize & + s.t . &",

    "the server @xcite platform was used as interface with the solver .",
    "( _ network enabled optimization system _ ) is an optimization service that is available through the internet .",
    "there is a large set of software packages , considered as the state of the art in optimization .",
    "the discretized problem , after a presolve done by the software , is transformed into 1455 variables , 1243 of which are nonlinear ; and 1039 constraints , 828 of which are nonlinear .",
    "next section presents the main obtained results .",
    "the results for the state and control variables are shown in figures [ plotx1 ] to [ plotu2 ] .",
    "each figure has three graphics : and , which correspond to the solutions obtained by the solvers used , respectively ; and msm , corresponding to the multiple shooting method @xcite that was used by the authors of the paper @xcite .",
    "it is important to salient that , at the time of the initial paper @xcite , the authors had nt the same computational resources that exist nowadays .",
    "the results we obtain using described methods ( and ) are better since the cost to combat the dengue disease and the number of infected individuals are smaller .",
    "figures  [ plotx1 ] and [ plotx2 ] show the density of dengue mosquitoes .",
    "it is possible to see that in this new solution , with the same number of mosquitoes than in the previous solution @xcite , the number of infected mosquitoes falls dramatically .",
    "infected mosquitoes ]     infected mosquitoes ]    [ plot ]    figures  [ plotx3 ] and [ plotx4 ] report to the population in the risk area .",
    "our solution shows that the number of ill people decrease quickly .",
    "that is also an explanation for the level of motivation to combat the mosquitos to be also lower than the previous solution proposed in @xcite .",
    "level of popular motivation ]     level of popular motivation ]    [ pplot ]    figure  [ plotx5 ] shows the accumulated cost .",
    "it is clear that almost all year the cost is lower when compared with msm @xcite .",
    "this lower cost level is a consequence of infected mosquitos and infected individuals both falling down under our approach .    ]",
    "figures  [ plotu1 ] and [ plotu2 ] are related to the controls applied : educational campaigns and application of insecticides .",
    "it is possible to see that the new functions for the control variables are more economic .",
    "educational campaigns ]    [ ppplot ]     educational campaigns ]",
    "at this moment the world , as a result of major demographic changes , rapid urbanization on a massive scale , global travel and environmental change , faces enormous future challenges from emerging infectious diseases .",
    "dengue illustrates well these challenges @xcite .    in this work we investigated an optimal control model to dengue epidemics proposed in @xcite , that includes the dynamics of the dengue mosquitoes , the effect of educational campaigns , and where the cost functional reflects a compromise between financial spending in insecticides and educational campaigns and the population health .",
    "for comparison reasons , the same choice of data / parameters as done in @xcite was considered . however , the methods used in the paper work also for other choices of the data and other problems @xcite .    until some years ago , due to computational limitations , most of the models were run using codes made by the authors themselves .",
    "this was the case with @xcite .",
    "nowadays , one can choose between several proper softwares `` out of the box '' , that already take into account specific features of stiff problems , scaling problems , etc . with this work it is possible to perceive that `` old '' problems can again be taken into account and be better analyzed with new technology and approaches , with the goal of finding global optimal solutions , instead of local ones .",
    "the optimal control problem @xcite was solved here numerically using @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the is a specific optimal control software , while is a standard nonlinear optimization solver .",
    "it is possible to verify that , despite the different philosophies of the and solvers , the reached is exactly the same .",
    "this fact enforces the robustness of the obtained results .",
    "the first software uses the optimal control theory in order to reach the solution .",
    "the second one , uses nonlinear programming as its main tool .",
    "it is important to mention that the problem under study is a difficult one .",
    "other nonlinear packages were tested , and they could not reach to a solution  some crashes at the middle or some bad scaling issues were observed .",
    "the results obtained from and coincide and improve the ones previously reported in @xcite ( section  [ sec:4 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the control policy we obtain makes big progress with respect to the previous best policy : the percentage of infected mosquitoes vanishes just after four weeks , while mosquitoes are completely irradicated after 30 weeks ( figures  [ plotx1 ] and [ plotx2 ] ) ; the number of infected individuals begin to decrease after four weeks while with the previous policy this happens after 23 weeks only ( figure  [ plotx3 ] ) .",
    "despite the fact that our results are better , they are accomplished with a much smaller cost with insecticides and educational campaigns ( figure  [ plotx5 ] ) .",
    "the general improvement done , which explain why the results are so successful , rely on an effective control policy of insecticides .",
    "the proposed use of insecticides seems to explain the big discrepancies between the results here obtained and the best policy of @xcite .",
    "our results show that applying insecticides in the first four weeks yields a substantial reduction in the cost of combating dengue , in terms of the functional proposed in @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion is that health authorities should pay attention to the epidemiology from the very beginning : effective control decisions in the first four weeks have a decisive role in the combat of dengue , and population and governments will both profit from it .    as future work",
    "we intend to analyze the model with different parameters in the objective function and understand how the heights associated to the variables can , or not , influence the decrease of the disease",
    ". it will be also interesting to analyze other problems , not only those related with the dengue , such as @xcite , but also with different biological illnesses , such as @xcite .",
