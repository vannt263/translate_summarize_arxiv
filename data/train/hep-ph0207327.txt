    "measurements of @xmath2 in semileptonic decays , @xmath8 in @xmath0@xmath5 mixing , and @xmath9 from cp violation in @xmath6@xmath7 and @xmath0@xmath5 mixing have firmly established the existence of a cp - violating phase in the ckm matrix .",
    "the present situation , often referred to as the `` standard analysis '' of the unitarity triangle , is summarized in figure  [ fig : utfit ] .",
    "three comments are in order concerning this analysis :    1 .",
    "the measurements of cp asymmetries in kaon physics ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and @xmath0@xmath5 mixing ( @xmath12 ) probe the imaginary part of @xmath13 and so establish cp violation in the top sector of the ckm matrix.\\ne 0 $ ] and @xmath14\\ne 0 $ ] . ]",
    "the ckm model predicts that the imaginary part of @xmath13 is related , by three - generation unitarity , to the imaginary part of @xmath15 , and that those two elements are ( to an excellent approximation ) the only sources of cp violation in flavor - changing processes . in order to test this prediction ,",
    "the next step must be to explore the cp - violating phase @xmath16 in the bottom sector of the ckm matrix . in this talk",
    "i argue that the analysis of charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays has by now established unambiguously that @xmath17 .",
    "2 .   with the exception of the @xmath12 measurement , the standard analysis",
    "is limited by large theoretical uncertainties , which dominate the widths of the various bands in the figure .",
    "these uncertainties enter via the calculation of hadronic matrix elements .",
    "i will discuss some novel methods to constrain the unitarity triangle using charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays , which are afflicted by smaller hadronic uncertainties and hence provide powerful new tests of the standard model , which can complement the standard analysis .",
    "3 .   with the exception of the measurement of @xmath2 in semileptonic @xmath0 decays ,",
    "the standard constraints are sensitive to meson  antimeson mixing . mixing amplitudes",
    "are of second order in weak interactions and hence might be most susceptible to effects from physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the new constraints on @xmath18 discussed below allow a construction of the unitarity triangle that is over - constrained and independent of @xmath0@xmath5 and @xmath6@xmath7 mixing .",
    "it is in this sense orthogonal to the standard analysis .",
    "the phase @xmath3 can be probed via tree ",
    "penguin interference in decays such as @xmath1 , for which the underlying flavor topologies are illustrated in figure  [ fig : topol ] .",
    "experiment teaches us that amplitude interference is sizable in these decays .",
    "information about @xmath3 can be obtained not only from the measurement of direct cp asymmetries ( @xmath19 ) , but also from the study of cp - averaged branching fractions ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the challenge is , of course , to gain theoretical control over the hadronic physics entering the tree - to - penguin ratios in the various decays .",
    "hadronic weak decays simplify greatly in the heavy - quark limit @xmath21 .",
    "the underlying physics is that a fast - moving light meson produced by a point - like source ( the effective weak hamiltonian ) decouples from soft qcd interactions @xcite .",
    "a systematic implementation of this color transparency argument is provided by the qcd factorization approach @xcite .",
    "this scheme makes rigorous predictions in the heavy - quark limit , some of which have been proven to all orders of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "one can hardly overemphasize the importance of controlling nonleptonic decay amplitudes in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "while a few years ago reliable calculations of such amplitudes appeared to be out of reach , we are now in a situation where hadronic uncertainties enter only at the level of power corrections suppressed by the heavy @xmath22-quark mass .",
    "= 6.6cm=8.7 cm    the workings of qcd factorization are illustrated in figure  [ fig : fact ] .",
    "the graph on the left shows how in the familiar construction of the effective weak hamiltonian hard gluon effects with virtualities @xmath23 can be calculated and factorized into wilson coefficients @xmath24 .",
    "the graphs on the right illustrate how , in a similar way , hard gluon effects with @xmath25 can be calculated and factorized into perturbative hard - scattering kernels @xmath26 . what remains after this step are factorized decay amplitudes , in which all gluon exchange between the emission meson at the `` upper vertex '' and the remaining hadronic system are integrated out . in the heavy - quark limit , such `` nonfactorizable gluons '' are hard because of color transparency .",
    "note that this does not imply that nonleptonic amplitudes in the heavy - quark limit are perturbative .",
    "( in this respect , our approach is more general that the pqcd scheme @xcite . ) important nonperturbative effects remain , which can be parameterized in terms of meson decay constants , @xmath27 transition form factors , and meson light - cone distribution amplitudes .",
    "these quantities are an input to the factorization formula , ideally taken from experiment .",
    "theoretical expressions for decay amplitudes obtained using the qcd factorization approach are complicated and depend on many input parameters .",
    "when discussing the theoretical uncertainties and limitations of this scheme it is important to distinguish between different classes of parameters . in order of phenomenological importance , these are standard model parameters ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , the renormalization scale ( @xmath33 ) , hadronic quantities that can ( at least in principle ) be determined from data ( decay constants , transition form factors ) , and hadronic quantities that can only indirectly be constrained by data ( light - cone distribution amplitudes ) .",
    "the most important question with regard to phenomenological applications of qcd factorization is that about the numerical size of power corrections .",
    "while the importance of the heavy - quark limit to the workings of factorization is evident from a comparison of nonfactorizable effects seen in kaon , charm and beauty decays @xcite , and while there is a lot of evidence ( from spectroscopy , exclusive semileptonic decays , and various inclusive decays ) that power corrections are small at the @xmath22-quark scale , it is nevertheless important to address the issue of power corrections in a systematic way .",
    "much effort has been devoted in the past few years to the study of power - suppressed effects , which in general violate factorization .",
    "the most important power corrections are proportional to the ratios @xmath34 or @xmath35 with @xmath36 , which are inversely proportional to light - quark masses .",
    "such twist-3 corrections make up for a significant portion of the penguin amplitudes in @xmath0 decays into light pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "it is important that these penguin contributions are calculable despite their power suppression and hence can be included reliably @xcite . at the same order",
    ", there appear logarithmically divergent twist-3 corrections to the leading - twist hard spectator interactions .",
    "these corrections are universal , and their effect can be absorbed into a redefinition of a single hadronic parameter @xmath37 .",
    "perhaps the largest uncertainty from power corrections is due to weak annihilation contributions , for which both of the valence quarks of the initial @xmath0 meson participate in the weak interactions @xcite .",
    "annihilation amplitudes violate factorization and thus can not be reliably computed using the qcd factorization approach .",
    "although we find that with default parameter values the annihilation amplitudes are typically small , their effects can become sizable when the large model uncertainties in their estimate are taken into account @xcite .",
    "other types of power corrections , such as soft nonfactorizable gluon exchange , have been investigated using qcd sum rules @xcite and the renormalon calculus @xcite .",
    "no large corrections of this type have been identified .",
    "while it is a conceptual challenge to gain a better control over the leading power corrections to qcd factorization , perhaps using the framework of the soft - collinear effective theory @xcite , it is important that this approach makes many testable predictions .",
    "their comparison with experimental data can teach us a lot about the importance of power - suppressed effects .",
    "deriving constraints on the unitarity triangle from charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays requires controlling the interference of tree and penguin topologies .",
    "this means that one must be able to predict not only the magnitudes of these contributions , but also their relative strong - interaction phase .",
    "fortunately , the crucial aspects of such calculations can be tested using experimental data .",
    "the magnitude of the leading @xmath38 tree amplitude can be probed in the decays @xmath39 , which to an excellent approximation do not receive any penguin contributions .",
    "the qcd factorization approach makes an absolute prediction for the corresponding branching ratio @xcite , @xmath40 \\cdot 10^{-6}\\times      \\left [ \\frac{|v_{ub}|}{0.0035}\\,\\frac{f_0^{b\\to\\pi}(0)}{0.28 }     \\right]^2 , \\ ] ] which compares well with the experimental result @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties quoted are due to input parameter variations and to the modeling of power corrections .",
    "an additional uncertainty comes from the present error on @xmath2 and the @xmath42 form factor .",
    "the magnitude of the leading @xmath43 penguin amplitude can be probed in the decays @xmath44 , which to an excellent approximation do not receive any tree contributions . combining it with the measurement of the tree amplitude just described , a tree - to - penguin ratio can be determined via the relation @xmath45^{1/2}\\ !     = 0.205\\pm 0.025 \\,.\\ ] ] the experimental value of this ratio is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction @xmath46 @xcite , which is independent of form factors but proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "this is a highly nontrivial test of the qcd factorization approach .",
    "recall that when the first measurements of charmless hadronic decays appeared several authors remarked that the penguin amplitudes were much larger than expected based on naive factorization models .",
    "we now see that qcd factorization naturally reproduces the correct magnitude of the tree - to - penguin ratio .",
    "this observation also shows that there is no need to supplement the qcd factorization predictions in an ad hoc way by adding enhanced phenomenological penguin amplitudes , such as the `` nonperturbative charming penguins '' introduced in @xcite .",
    "qcd factorization predicts that most strong - interaction phases in charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays are parametrically suppressed in the heavy - quark limit , because @xmath48 \\,.\\ ] ] this implies small direct cp asymmetries since , e.g. , @xmath49 .",
    "the suppression results as a consequence of systematic cancellations of soft contributions , which are missed in phenomenological models of final - state interactions . in other schemes the strong - interaction phases",
    "are predicted to be larger , and therefore larger cp asymmetries are expected .",
    "present data show no evidence for large direct cp asymmetries in charmless decays @xcite , but the errors are still too large to distinguish between different theoretical predictions .",
    "an important exception is the direct cp asymmetry for the decays @xmath50 , which is already measured with high precision . the current world average , @xmath51 @xcite , implies a rather small value of the corresponding strong - interaction phase , which is consistent with the expectation that this phase be suppressed in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "specifically , for @xmath3 in the range between @xmath52 and @xmath4 , i obtain @xmath53 .",
    "simple physical arguments suggest that the relevant strong - interaction phases in the decays @xmath50 and @xmath54 should be very similar @xcite .",
    "this observation will become important below .",
    "various ratios of cp - averaged @xmath1 branching fractions exhibit a strong dependence on @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is thus possible to derive constraints on @xmath28 and @xmath29 from a global analysis of the data in the context of the qcd factorization approach , provided conservative error estimates for power corrections are included .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of such an analysis was presented in @xcite , to which i refer the reader for details . the original result obtained in that paper",
    "is reproduced in the left plot in figure  [ fig : rhoeta ] .",
    "it reflects the status of the data as of spring 2001 .",
    "the right plot shows an update of this analysis using the latest experimental data @xcite .",
    "i have also updated two input parameters in order to take into account recent theoretical developments .",
    "the new analysis uses @xmath55mev at @xmath56gev , and @xmath57mev .",
    "the values adopted in @xcite were @xmath58mev and @xmath59mev .",
    "= 7.5cm=7.5 cm    the fit is excellent , which @xmath60 for three degrees of freedom .",
    "there is no problem in accounting for all of the experimental data simultaneously .",
    "the inclusion of model estimates of weak annihilation effects enlarges the allowed regions in the @xmath18 plane but is not required to fit the data . leaving out all annihilation contributions , one still obtains a good fit ( @xmath61 ) and similar best - fit values for the wolfenstein parameters .",
    "the comparison of the two plots shown in the figure indicates the effect of the increase in experimental precision between spring 2001 and summer 2002 .",
    "the most important conclusion from this analysis is that , with the new data , the combination of results from rare hadronic @xmath0 decays with the @xmath2 measurement in semileptonic decays ( dashed circles ) excludes @xmath62 and so establishes the existence of a cp - violating phase in the bottom sector of the ckm matrix .",
    "the allowed regions obtained from the fit to charmless hadronic decays are compatible with the standard fit ( shown by the yellow region ) , but tend to favor larger @xmath3 values .",
    "this tendency has been reinforced with the new data .",
    "the same trend is seen in an analysis that does not rely on qcd factorization but instead employs general amplitude parameterizations and flavor symmetries @xcite .",
    "it is tantalizing to speculate about the possible origin of a ( still hypothetical ) disagreement between the allowed @xmath18 regions obtained from the standard analysis and from charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays .",
    "a conventional explanation of such a discrepancy might be that the errors in lattice calculations of the relevant matrix elements for @xmath63@xmath64 and @xmath65@xmath66 mixing have been underestimated .",
    "in fact , in a recent paper the value @xmath67 was obtained @xcite , which is significantly larger than the result @xmath68 used in previous analyses of the unitarity triangle . with such large @xmath69 , values of @xmath3 in the vicinity of @xmath4",
    "are no longer excluded by the @xmath70 bound .",
    "a more exciting possibility is , of course , to invoke new physics to explain the discrepancy .",
    "assume first that in charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays one probes the true value of the ckm phase @xmath3 .",
    "in this case a discrepancy with the standard analysis would most likely be due to a new physics contribution to @xmath0@xmath5 mixing .",
    "for instance , there could be new physics affecting @xmath65@xmath66 mixing . eliminating the corresponding constraint from the standard analysis one finds that larger values of @xmath3 are allowed .",
    "this possibility will hopefully soon be checked , when @xmath65@xmath66 mixing will be explored at the tevatron .",
    "alternatively , there could be new physics affecting @xmath63@xmath64 mixing . in this case one",
    "should eliminate the constraints arising from the measurements of @xmath71 , @xmath70 , and @xmath12 from the standard analysis .",
    "then only the constraints from @xmath6@xmath7 mixing and semileptonic @xmath0 decays remain , which allow for large values of @xmath3 .",
    "a different possibility would be that the mixing amplitudes are unaffected by new physics , but that there exist non - standard contributions to @xmath72 or @xmath73 fcnc transitions , e.g.  from penguin and box diagrams involving the exchange of new heavy particles .",
    "( a more exotic model with light susy particles has also been considered @xcite . ) in this case , @xmath3 measured in @xmath1 decays would be a combination of the ckm angle and some new cp - violating phase .",
    "many examples of new physics models that could yield a significant additional phase have been explored in @xcite .",
    "a clean test of this possibility would be the measurement of the time - dependent cp asymmetry in @xmath74 decays , which in the standard model is due to the interference of a ( real ) @xmath75 penguin amplitude with the @xmath63@xmath64 mixing amplitude . if there was a new physics phase @xmath76 of the penguin amplitude , then the cp asymmetry in @xmath74 would measure @xmath77 , which when compared with the value of @xmath12 measured in @xmath78 decays would reveal the existence of the phase @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "note that this strategy would not be invalidated even if there was a new physics contribution to @xmath63@xmath64 mixing . in this case",
    "@xmath79 would no longer be given by the ckm phase , but this effect would cancel out in the comparison of the two decay modes .",
    "if the trend toward larger @xmath3 values revealed by the analysis of charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays persists , one will want to check the compatibility with the standard analysis using measurements whose theoretical interpretation is `` clean '' in the sense that it only relies on assumptions that can be tested using experimental data . here",
    "i propose a novel construction of the unitarity triangle ( which i call the cp-@xmath22 triangle , because it establishes a cp - violating phase in the @xmath22 sector of the ckm matrix ) which has this property , is over - determined , and can be performed using already existing data .",
    "most importantly , this construction is insensitive to potential new physics effects in @xmath0@xmath5 or @xmath6@xmath7 mixing .",
    "i will argue that the theoretical uncertainties limiting this construction are considerably smaller than for the standard analysis .",
    "the first ingredient is the ratio @xmath47 extracted from semileptonic @xmath0 decays , whose current value is @xmath80 .",
    "several strategies have been proposed to determine @xmath2 with a theoretical accuracy of about 10% @xcite , which would be a significant improvement .",
    "the first plot in figure  [ fig : cpt ] shows the corresponding constraint in the @xmath18 plane . here and below the narrow , dark - colored band shows the theoretical uncertainty , while the lighter band gives the current value .",
    "the second ingredient is a constraint derived from the ratio of the cp - averaged branching fractions for the decays @xmath81 and @xmath82 , using a generalization of the method suggested in @xcite .",
    "the experimental inputs to this analysis are the tree - to - penguin ratio @xmath83 mentioned earlier , and the ratio @xmath84 }     = 0.78\\pm 0.11\\ ] ] of two cp - averaged @xmath43 branching fractions @xcite . without any recourse to qcd factorization",
    "this method provides a bound on @xmath85 , which can be turned into a determination of @xmath85 ( for fixed value of @xmath86 ) when information on the relevant strong - interaction phase @xmath87 is available .",
    "i have argued at the end of section  [ sec : tests ] that the phase @xmath87 is bound by experimental data ( and very general theoretical arguments ) to be small , of order @xmath88 .",
    "( in the future , this phase can be determined directly from the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath82 decays . )",
    "it is thus conservative to assume that @xmath89 , corresponding to @xmath90 . with this assumption ,",
    "the corresponding allowed region in the @xmath18 plane was analysed in @xcite , to which",
    "i refer the reader for details .",
    "the resulting constraint is shown in the second plot in figure  [ fig : cpt ] .",
    "the third constraint comes from a measurement of the time - dependent cp asymmetry @xmath91 in @xmath92 decays .",
    "the present experimental situation is unfortunately unclear , since the measurements by babar ( @xmath93 ) and belle ( @xmath94 ) are inconsistent with each other @xcite .",
    "the naive average of these results gives @xmath95 ( with an inflated error ) .",
    "the theoretical expression for the asymmetry is @xmath96 here @xmath97 is the cp - violating phase of the @xmath63@xmath64 mixing amplitude , which in the standard model equals @xmath98 .",
    "usually , it is argued that for small @xmath99 ratio the quantity @xmath100 is approximately given by @xmath101 , and so apart from a `` penguin pollution '' the asymmetry @xmath102 . here",
    "i adopt a different strategy @xcite . in order to become insensitive to possible new physics contributions to the mixing amplitude ,",
    "i use the experimental value @xmath103 @xcite and write @xmath104 , with a sign ambiguity in the real part .",
    "( the plus sign is suggested by the standard fit of the unitarity triangle . ) a measurement of @xmath105 can then be translated into a constraint on @xmath3 ( or @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , which remains valid even if the @xmath106 measurement is affected by new physics .",
    "the result obtained with the current experimental values and assuming @xmath107 is shown in the third plot in figure  [ fig : cpt ] .",
    "the resulting bands for @xmath108 are obtained by a reflection about the @xmath28 axis .",
    "this follows because the expression for @xmath105 is invariant under the simultaneous replacements @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "each of the three constraints in figure  [ fig : cpt ] are , at present , limited by rather large experimental errors , while comparison with figure  [ fig : utfit ] shows that the theoretical limitations are smaller than for the standard analysis . yet , even at the present level of accuracy it is interesting to combine the three constraints and construct the resulting allowed regions for the apex of the unitarity triangle . the result is shown in figure  [ fig : summary ] .",
    "note that the lines corresponding to the new constraints intersect the circles representing the @xmath2 constraint at large angles , indicating that the three measurements used in the construction of the cp-@xmath22 triangle give highly complementary information on @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "there are four allowed regions , two corresponding to @xmath107 ( dark shading ) and two to @xmath108 ( light shading ) .",
    "if we use the information that the measured value of @xmath10 requires a positive value of @xmath29 , then only the two solutions in the upper half - plane remain .",
    "one of these regions ( corresponding to @xmath107 ) is close to the standard fit , though once again somewhat larger @xmath3 values are preferred .",
    "( if only the babar result is used for @xmath105 , then this region is shifted toward yet larger values of @xmath3 . )",
    "i stress that this agreement is highly nontrivial , since with the exception of @xmath2 none of the standard constraints are used in this construction .",
    "interestingly , there is a second allowed region ( corresponding to @xmath108 ) which would be consistent with the constraint from @xmath10 ( see figure  [ fig : utfit ] ) and the global analysis of charmless hadronic decays ( see figure  [ fig : rhoeta ] ) , but inconsistent with the constraints derived from @xmath12 and @xmath70 .",
    "such a solution would require a significant new physics contribution to @xmath0@xmath5 mixing .",
    "after the by now precise measurement of @xmath12 , the study of charmless two - body modes of @xmath0 mesons is presently the next hottest topic in @xmath0 physics .",
    "qcd factorization provides the theoretical framework for a systematic analysis of hadronic @xmath0 decay amplitudes based on the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "this theory has already passed successfully several nontrivial tests , and will be tested more thoroughly with more precise data .    a global fit to @xmath1",
    "decays establishes the existence of a cp - violating phase in the bottom sector of the ckm matrix and tends to favor values of @xmath3 near @xmath4 , somewhat larger than the value suggested by the standard analysis of the unitarity triangle .",
    "if this trend were real , it would suggest several possibilities for new flavor physics beyond the standard model , ranging from new contributions to @xmath0@xmath5 mixing to non - standard fcnc transitions of the type @xmath111 or @xmath112 . in the future",
    ", the construction of the cp-@xmath22 triangle will provide stringent tests of the standard model with small theoretical uncertainties .",
