    "a central problem in quantum information theory @xcite is the formulation of appropriate measures that quantify the degree of entanglement in composite systems .",
    "particularly important entanglement measures are the concurrence @xcite and the entanglement of formation @xcite .",
    "these quantities have been widely used in many applications .",
    "examples include studies on the role of entanglement in quantum phase transitions @xcite , on the emergence of long - distance entanglement in spin systems @xcite , and on additivity properties of the holevo capacity of quantum channels @xcite .",
    "the explicit determination of most of the proposed entanglement measures for a generic state @xmath1 is an extremely demanding task that requires the solution of a high - dimensional optimization problem .",
    "the development of analytical lower bounds for the various entanglement measures is therefore of great interest .",
    "recently , chen , albeverio , and fei @xcite have derived such bounds for the concurrence @xmath2 and for the entanglement of formation @xmath3 .",
    "they achieved this by relating @xmath2 and @xmath3 to two important and strong separability criteria , namely to the peres criterion of positive partial transposition ( ppt ) @xcite and to the realignment criterion @xcite . according to these criteria",
    "a given state @xmath1 is entangled ( inseparable ) if the trace norms @xmath4 or @xmath5 are strictly larger than 1 , where @xmath6 denotes the partial transposition and @xmath7 the realignment transformation . in refs .",
    "@xcite tight lower bounds for @xmath2 and @xmath3 have been formulated in terms of these trace norms .    here ,",
    "we extend the connection between separability criteria and entanglement measures to a new criterion which has been developed recently @xcite .",
    "this criterion is based on a universal nondecomposable positive map which leads to a class of optimal entanglement witnesses . employing these witnesses we derive analytical lower bounds for the concurrence and for the entanglement of formation that can be expressed in terms of a simple linear functional of the given state @xmath1 .",
    "the entanglement witnesses constructed here have the special feature of being nondecomposable optimal .",
    "this notion has been introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite to characterize optimality properties of entanglement witnesses .",
    "it means that the witnesses are able to identify entangled ppt states and that no other witnesses exist which can detect more such states .",
    "it follows that the bounds developed here can be sharper than those obtained from the ppt criterion and that they are particularly efficient near the border that separates the ppt entangled states from the separable states .",
    "in addition , we will demonstrate that they can also be stronger than the bounds given by the realignment criterion .",
    "hence , the new bounds complement and considerably improve the existing bounds .",

    "we will develop a necessary condition for the separability of mixed quantum states which employs the symmetry transformation of the time reversal @xcite .",
