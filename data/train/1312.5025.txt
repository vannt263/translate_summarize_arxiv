    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , allowing a secret key between two legitimate parties ( alice and bob ) to be established @xcite , has been applied to quantum information networks based on the trusted node or relay @xcite . however , in order to construct high - security and -performance networks , measurement - device - independent ( mdi ) qkd would be a very promising alternative since it not only removes all detector side - channel attacks , the most important security loophole of qkd implementations , by leaving the detection procedure to the untrusted relay but also supplies excellent performance with current technology @xcite .",
    "measurement - device - independent qkd , which is a time - reversed einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr)-based qkd scheme @xcite , consists of alice and bob respectively sending single - photon states to the third partner , charlie , who makes a bell - state measurement ( bsm ) and broadcasts his measurement results , and it has been a big step forward to bridge the gap between the theory and the real - world implementation of qkd @xcite . based on the idea of discrete - variable entanglement swapping and two - photon interference , the bsm can postselect the entanglement states between alice and bob and does not disclose the information about encodings , so this protocol allows the legitimate parties to establish the secure keys , which are independent of the measurement device , and all detection side - channel attacks are removed by leaving the detection procedure to the third partner .    as a counterpart , motivated by continuous - variable entanglement swapping @xcite , here , we propose a scheme to implement the mdi - qkd with continuous variables instead of discrete ones , i.e. , with the source of gaussian - modulated coherent states ; thus we can confirm the security of this protocol by the optimality of gaussian attacks @xcite .",
    "we show that with respect to this protocol two different reconciliation strategies , direct reconciliation ( dr ) and reverse reconciliation ( rr ) , can be used to extract the secure keys even though this protocol seems symmetric for alice and bob compared to charlie , and both are high performance .",
    "the detection side - channel attacks against continuous - variable qkd , such as the wavelength attack @xcite , the calibration attack @xcite , the local oscillator ( lo ) intensity attack @xcite , and the saturation attack @xcite , also have been excluded , and the expensive and low - detection - efficiency single - photon detectors used by discrete - variable mdi - qkd are also replaced by the lower - cost and higher - detection - efficiency balanced homodyne detectors ( bhds ) .",
    "hence this protocol for continuous - variable mdi - qkd not only can be implemented with current technology but also has high key rates , like the conventional one - way continuous - variable ( cv ) qkd protocol [ e.g. , the grosshans - grangier protocol ( gg02 protocol ) @xcite ; see details in ref .",

    "_ preparation_. alice and bob each prepare coherent states in the phase space and send them to the third partner , charlie , simultaneously , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . here",
    "the input modes can be described as @xmath0 for alice and bob , respectively , where @xmath1 are classical encoding variables with centered gaussian distribution of zero mean and variance @xmath2 and @xmath3 are vacuum modes .",
    "for all quadratures @xmath4 and @xmath5 of coherent states , they are defined as @xmath6 .",
    "the overall variance @xmath7 of alice s initial mode is given by @xmath8 in shot - noise units , where @xmath2 is the modulation variance mentioned before , and here we assume that bob s variance of his mode is the same as alice s , which they can agree on before key distribution without loss of generality @xcite .",
    "_ measurement_. charlie combines these two input modes with a balanced beam splitter ( bs ) and makes a continuous - variable bsm @xcite on the two modes with two bhds shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , i.e. , one port detecting @xmath4 quadrature and the other @xmath5 quadrature .",
    "thus he will get the measurements , for example , @xmath9 and @xmath10 over the lossless and noiseless channels , up to a multiplier of @xmath11 introduced by the bs @xcite .",
    "then , he broadcasts these measurement results to alice and bob .",
    "note that the lo used by charlie is sent by either alice or bob , and before that , both alice and bob have defined the same signal - modulation reference frame by manipulating their respective lo beams ( see details in appendix [ sec : define ] ) .",
    "_ parameter estimation and security extraction_. alice and bob reveal part of their encodings , and based on charlie s measurement results , they estimate the channel transmissions and excess noises . to establish the correlated data and secure keys , either alice or bob subtracts her or his encodings from charlie s measurement results . for convenience , we assume that bob implements this subtraction procedure since the protocol is symmetric ; that is , bob will take the data ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 , denoted as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , as estimations of alice s encodings to establish the secure keys , where @xmath16 is the estimated channel transmission between bob and charlie . since eve does not know bob s encodings , she does not know alice s encodings accurately either from just the publication of quadratures @xmath4 and @xmath5 . of course , she can learn part of the information from @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "_ data postprocessing_. alice and bob extract the secret keys from their raw data using the current error correction and privacy amplification techniques @xcite after they calculate the secret key rate between them .",
    "to estimate the security bounds of our protocol , we consider the entangling cloner shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] to bound eve s information . in the security analysis of conventional one - way cvqkd protocols , the collective gaussian attacks",
    "up to an appropriate symmetrization of the protocols are considered to be the optimal general attacks @xcite .",
    "the entangling cloner is the most powerful and practical example of a collective gaussian attack @xcite and is shown to be optimal for a single or one - mode channel @xcite .",
    "but in two - way protocols , the optimal attack is not clear with respect to two interaction channels , and the entangling cloner attack has only been demonstrated to be optimal in the hybrid two - way protocol @xcite . in this work , we restrict our analysis to two markovian memoryless gaussian channels , which do not interact with each other and thus can be reduced to a one - mode channel @xcite .",
    "hence , in this sense , the two independent entangling cloner attacks , one in each of the untrusted channels of our protocol , are reduced to one - mode attacks and thus can be taken as the optimal one - mode collective gaussian attack ( the most powerful attack corresponding to two memory gaussian channels that interact with each other is analyzed in another work and is not analyzed in this paper ; see the note ) .",
    "this attack consists of eve interacting on alice s and bob s modes with her half of each epr pair , respectively , and the quantum channels are replaced by two beam splitters with transmissions @xmath17 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "then , she collects all the modes to store them in her quantum memory and makes collective measurements on these modes to acquire information at any time during the classical data - postprocessing procedure implemented by alice and bob .",

    "as mentioned before , bob s recast data are obtained by subtracting his own encodings from charlie s publications . before describing them ,",
    "we first give the expressions for the bsm results @xmath4 and @xmath5 under the entangling cloner attack shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "they can be written as @xmath22 up to the multiplier of @xmath11 mentioned before , which can be incorporated with the left - hand sides of the above equations . here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are eve s epr modes , whose variances are @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "are used to simulate the variances of the practical channel excess noises @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ; that is , @xmath27 for the channel between alice and charlie , @xmath28 for the channel between bob and charlie , and both are referred to their respective channel inputs . @xmath17 and @xmath16 are the respective channel transmissions of the channel between alice or bob and charlie , and both can be estimated in the parameter - estimation procedure .",
    "then , we can recast bob s data as @xmath29    since the set of data in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qb ] ) is a noisy version of alice s encodings , restricted to one - mode attack , this protocol is equivalent to the conventional one - way cvqkd protocol with heterodyne detection @xcite . in this sense , we can use the conventional standard methods to analyze its security bounds .",
    "like for one - way cvqkd , two different strategies of reconciliation , dr and rr , can be used to extract secure keys . in dr , alice s encodings",
    "are taken as the referential raw keys ; thus bob tries to guess them and reconcile his data to be identical to them by virtue of the additional classical side information sent by alice . in rr",
    "bob s recast data are taken as the raw keys ; therefore alice tries to make her encodings identical to them , requiring bob to send side information .",
    "note that eve s entangling cloner attacks for these two reconciliation procedures are different . in dr ,",
    "eve just guesses alice s encodings , and bob s encodings have no contributions for her , so restricted to a one - mode attack , the entangling cloner attack on bob s mode is no use to her except for reducing the mutual information between alice and bob .",
    "however , in rr , eve tries to guess bob s recast data , including not only alice s encoding component but also the noise component , so she can acquire information with the help of entangling cloner attacks on both channels , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .    before calculating the secret key rates of this protocol in dr and rr ,",
    "we first compute the shannon information between alice and bob , and then in the following sections we bound eve s information using the standard method ( see @xcite ) since this protocol is equivalent to the conventional one - way cvqkd protocol with heterodyne detection @xcite .    assuming the symmetry of both quadratures , the mutual information between alice and bob can be given by @xmath30 note that they are identical in dr and rr and there is no multiplier of @xmath31 out the front since two quadratures",

    "next , we calculate the secret key rates between alice and bob in dr and rr , respectively , by bounding eve s information .      in dr , charlie s publication results will disclose some information , which is equal to giving eve the virtual mode @xmath40 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "hence , eve s information about alice s encodings consists of the shannon information @xmath41 since @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is a classical variable and the holevo information @xmath44 .",
    "the two kinds of information may partly contain each other , but we take the superposition as zero for simplicity .",

    "in addition , we can easily check that the maximum transmission distance in the asymptotic case is extended by only about 2 km compared to the one in the case with @xmath149 and @xmath148 .",
    "this means that the asymptotic calculation of the eigenvalues and holevo information @xmath85 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eigen ] ) and ( [ eq : xbe ] ) , respectively , is also applicable to the case of experimental realization with an appropriately large modulation variance . finally , we point out that the asymptotic key rates for other cases in dr and rr with symmetric or asymmetric channels can also be easily obtained using the above method , i.e. , by setting @xmath147 and @xmath148 in the calculation for the key rates . for the purpose of experimental realization ,",
    "i.e. , using the experimentally realistic parameters , we do not give their results here .",

    "<S> measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution ( mdi - qkd ) , leaving the detection procedure to the third partner and thus being immune to all detector side - channel attacks , is very promising for the construction of high - security quantum information networks . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a scheme to implement mdi - qkd , but with continuous variables instead of discrete ones , i.e. , with the source of gaussian - modulated coherent states , based on the principle of continuous - variable entanglement swapping . </S>",
    "<S> this protocol not only can be implemented with current telecom components but also has high key rates compared to its discrete counterpart ; thus it will be highly compatible with quantum networks . </S>"
