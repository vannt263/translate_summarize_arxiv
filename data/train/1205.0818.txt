    "the formation and evolution of objects at the low - mass end of the initial mass function is one of the most fundamental and yet not fully understood issues in our current picture of how stars form and evolve .",
    "the existence of brown dwarfs ( bds ; @xmath12m@xmath13 ) down to @xmath14m@xmath15 can be explained within the standard framework of star formation @xcite . by including additional physics such as turbulence , dynamical interactions @xcite , disk fragmentation @xcite , and/or photo - erosion from nearby bright stars @xcite",
    ", one can create objects with even lower masses ( down to @xmath16m@xmath15 ) .",
    "the relative importance of these mechanisms in producing the galactic substellar population is unclear .",
    "the key here is to confront predictions from the various scenarios with observational results .",
    "one means of testing these theories is through the empirical characterization of very - low - mass ( vlm ) multiple systems . as summarized in @xcite , these systems",
    "are observed to be less frequent , more tightly bound , and of higher mass ratios than their more massive counterparts .",
    "wide binaries are of interest because their large separations ( greater than 100 au ) and low binding energies provide direct constraints for formation models .",
    "for example , wide binaries are expected to be disrupted during the ejection process .",
    "this directly challenges the ejection model for the formation of vlm stars and bds .",
    "several other models have been been successful in creating wide vlm binaries , e.g. by fragmentation during the cluster formation @xcite , in fragmenting disks @xcite , or by dynamical capture during star cluster dissolution phase @xcite .",
    "the models by @xcite and @xcite predict the frequency of binaries with separations @xmath17au to be a few percent , compared with a fraction of @xmath18 found observationally for nearby @xcite and young @xcite stars . in star forming regions",
    ", the fraction of wide binaries appears to decrease with decreasing stellar mass @xcite .",
    "while the number of known wide binaries containing ultracool components is constantly growing as more searches are performed , they are mostly reported in an individual fashion , rather than in complete samples that would allow us to asses their true frequency . despite the effort that has been devoted to modeling over the past decade ,",
    "evolutionary tracks and atmosphere models for ultracool objects still suffer from uncertainties .",
    "widely separated l and t dwarf companions to nearby stars are also valuable for studying the evolution and atmospheres of brown dwarfs .",
    "the possibility for independent determination of age , mass , and metallicity makes these brown dwarfs benchmark objects for calibration of evolutionary models and atmospheric studies @xcite .",
    "the transition between the spectral types l and t occurs over a small temperature range of 200 - 300 k @xcite , and is believed to be caused by the depletion of condensate clouds , where the driving mechanism for the depletion is inadequately explained by current cloud models @xcite .",
    "the complex dynamic behavior of condensate clouds of low temperature atmospheres at the l / t transition is one of the leading problems in brown dwarf astrophysics today @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report the discovery of a brown dwarf at the l / t transition , and two nearby wide binaries consisting of m - dwarf primaries with early l - type and late t - type companions .",
    "we performed a cross - match between the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalog and the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) preliminary data release catalog , in order to search for common proper motion pairs containing at least one very - low - mass component . following",
    "the successful approach of @xcite , the correlation of catalogs , calculation of proper motions , and identification of co - moving stars was done in overlapping sections of 4 deg@xmath19 of the sky at a time . for every wise source , we found the closest 2mass match and computed proper motion vectors with uncertainties .",
    "we then selected stars that had moved at @xmath20 level compared to all others within the search area .",
    "stars within @xmath21 of one another with proper motion amplitudes agreeing within @xmath22 and proper motion components agreeing within @xmath23 in either right ascension or declination were flagged as potential binaries . towards the end of writing",
    "this paper , the new all - sky release of the wise catalog became available .",
    "we have repeated the proper motion measurements for the 4 deg@xmath19 fields around the three objects reported here .",
    "the main reason for repeating these measurements is the improved astrometry for the faint sources in the new catalog .",
    "the uncertainties in declination in the wise preliminary catalog were computed by adding @xmath24 in quadrature to the extraction measurement uncertainty to reflect the impact of the declination bias error known to affect a large fraction of sources fainter than @xmath2513@xmath26mag .",
    "this has been corrected in the new release .",
    "thus , while the main search for binaries has been performed using the preliminary version , listed proper motions and photometry are based on the all - sky release of the wise catalog .",
    "@xcite recently published a compilation of 2mass and wise photometry for @xmath27 early m- to late t - dwarfs .",
    "mid - infrared wise photometry is particularly suitable for l / t dwarf selection , because of their red @xmath28 colors , which are almost unique among astrophysical sources .",
    "additionally , @xmath29 color can be used to distinguish between bds on the one side , and agb stars and dust - obscured galaxies on the other @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we describe the procedure for selection of the candidate binary systems suitable for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "first , we required a , b or c photometric quality flags for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 photometry for all the components of the potential binary systems .",
    "after this initial flagging , we were left with @xmath36 objects .",
    "we then rejected all candidates for which at least one of the components does not satisfy the following conditions : located to the left of the solid line in the @xmath29 vs. @xmath28 diagram ( figure  [ ccds ] left ) , @xmath37 between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the latter condition was applied to discard a large group of contaminants that occupy the color space with @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the right panel of figure  [ ccds ] . relaxing this condition to @xmath45 results in @xmath46 candidates . by applying the cut at @xmath47 , we were left with only 19 candidates .",
    "clearly , this restriction makes our search insensitive to essentially all m - m pairs , and a large portion of l - type companions earlier than l6 will be discarded as well . after applying the color cuts on either of the components of a candidate binary system , we inspected the remaining 19 candidates visually , in order to remove false positives .",
    "in most cases these contain blends of unresolved source pairs in wise , due to significantly lower resolution when compared with 2mass .",
    "two color - color diagrams used for the selection are shown in figure  [ ccds ] .",
    "color - coded dots show the colors of m , l and t dwarfs taken from @xcite , while the black symbols show the objects reported in this paper . in the following subsections we describe the three discoveries reported in this paper , along with the known parameters obtained from the literature .",
    "2mass and wise photometry for the objects reported in this paper are listed in table  [ t_phot ] .",
    "table  [ t_prop ] contains the proper motions and other physical properties of the objects discussed in the next sections .",
    "2m06143818 + 3950357 ( hereafter 2m0614 + 3950 ) was at first identified as a companion to 2m06143791 + 3951202 . with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , the latter object is marginally consistent with being an early m - dwarf . however , an m0 dwarf as faint as @xmath51 would have to be at a distance larger than 1kpc . by checking the optical catalogs of the region",
    ", we found that the optical source matching 2m06143791 + 3951202 has essentially the same position as the 2mass source ( offset of @xmath52 from gsc2.2 and usno - b1 catalog positions ) , whereas at the measured proper motion we would expect an offset of @xmath53 between the gsc2.2 and 2mass , and @xmath54 between usno - b1 and 2mass .",
    "furthermore , in the optical images the position reported by wise appears to be located between the source matching the 2mass position and another faint ( r@xmath55 ) source not detected by 2mass .",
    "we thus conclude that the wise source identified here as a potential primary of a binary system is most probably a blend.the suspected secondary , however , has colors that are consistent with a late - l or an early - t ultracool dwarf , and was therefore included in our spectroscopic follow - up .",

    "the authors conclude that this does not result from observational biases , i.e. the survey is sensitive to pairs with much lower mass ratios .",
    "a similar result is obtained by @xcite in the volume - complete 8-pc sample , constituted mostly ( 80% ) of m - dwarfs .",
    "however , the sensitivity to mass ratios in both works is reported for the entire samples , rather than for m dwarfs alone , and the sensitivity to low mass ratio systems will fall off with lower - mass primaries . in a study of multiplicity among m - dwarfs , @xcite found that the distribution of mass ratios is flat and perhaps declines at low mass ratios .",
    "a number of low-@xmath202 binary systems containing ultracool components are known to date , some with the mass - ratios as low as 0.05 ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a complete sample sensitive to ultracool dwarfs of the very lowest masses is needed to assess the distribution of mass ratios in this regime .",
    "it has been found that binaries wider than @xmath93100  au have a high rate of tertiaries , both in the stellar and substellar regimes , and that the binary fraction of ultracool companions found in multiple systems appears to be significantly larger than that of field dwarfs @xcite .",
    "this behavior has also been predicted by some dynamical models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dwarfs with spectral types of late l or early t show a higher multiplicity fraction compared to other types ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "this has been attributed to the rapid evolution through the l / t transition phase , implying fewer sources per spectral subtype for a given field sample @xcite .",
    "unresolved binaries can be identified by an apparent over - luminosity for a given spectral subtype , where an independent distance estimate is available ( e.g. @xcite ) , or by spectral deviations from template spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite identified several common trends that stand out when comparing the combined near - infrared spectra of resolved l / t binaries with the template spectra of single objects .",
    "the spex spectrum of the l / t transition dwarf 2m0614 + 3950 ( figure [ 2m0614 ] ) is closely matched by the l9 spectral template , and does not show any of the deviations pointed out in @xcite .",
    "for the two wide binaries , 2m0525 - 7425ab and 2m1348 - 1344ab , the distance estimates of the primaries are in excellent agreement with the independent distance estimates of the secondaries .",
    "for example , by placing the t5.5 dwarf 2m1348 - 1344b at the distance of the primary augmented by its 1@xmath203 uncertainty + 0.25 in its absolute j - magnitude , and -0.15 in its @xmath37 color , still consistent with the derived spectral type .",
    "also , all of the component spectra presented here do not appear to deviate significantly from the spectral templates .",
    "we note that the classification of 2m0525 - 7425b originates from @xcite , who do not show a spectrum in the paper , but neither report any peculiarities .",
    "we conclude that , while we have no reason to suspect any unresolved binarity in the objects discussed here , high resolution imaging and/or radial velocity study is necessary to prove this claim .      among the multiple systems produced in hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation by @xcite , about @xmath204",
    "are stars ( @xmath205m@xmath13 ) with vlm ( @xmath206m@xmath13 ) companions .",
    "about 30% of these star / vlm binary systems have semi - major axes larger than 1000  au , and several objects with primary masses similar to those of the two systems reported here are created .",
    "although there appears to be no statistically significant dependence of the frequency of star / vlm binaries on primary mass , the typical separation of such binaries seems to increase strongly with the primary mass . as for the mass ratios for the systems with 0.1  0.5 m@xmath13 primaries",
    ", @xcite predicts a slight preference towards near - equal mass systems .",
    "however , a significant number of systems with low - mass ratios is produced in the simulations , with about 15% of the binaries having @xmath207 .",
    "another prediction of this model is a corrrelation between mass ratio and separation for the binaries , with closer systems having a preference for equal masses . the median mass ratio for binary separations in range 1000 ",
    "10@xmath208 au is 0.17 , comparable to the mass ratios observed in our two binary systems .",
    "simulations by @xcite show that very wide ( up to 10  000 au ) , low - mass ( secondary mass @xmath195 80 m@xmath15 ) companions can be formed in fragmenting stellar disks . in the simulation of a 0.7@xmath26m@xmath13 star with a disk of an equal mass and a radius of 400  au , wide ( 400 - 10  000  au ) binary companions to the central star",
    "are predominantly brown dwarfs .",
    "an alternative mechanism to form wide binaries was proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their n - body simulations of star clusters in dissolution show that binaries with separations larger than 1000  au can be formed by dynamical capture of initially unbound objects .",
    "while the wide binary fraction from @xcite varies significantly with the initial conditions , by integrating over the initial cluster mass distribution they predict a wide binary fraction of a few percent in the galactic field . for wide systems with separations",
    "@xmath209au and primary masses below @xmath210m@xmath13",
    ", @xcite models predict the increase in the number of the systems with decreasing the mass ratio .",
    "the mass - ratio distributions peaks around @xmath211 .    the existence of binaries with total system masses , mass ratios and separations similar to the two systems reported here is clearly supported by predictions of different theoretical models .",
    "a proper statistical analysis of complete wide binary samples is needed to asses their overall frequency and distribution of properties such as mass ratio , and to be able to compare these observational results with the predictions of the models .",
    "we have presented the results of our search for common proper motion pairs containing ultracool components , based on 2mass and preliminary wise data catalogs , followed by optical or nir spectroscopy of individual candidate components .",
    "we report the discovery of two wide binaries containing ultracool components , and one ultracool dwarf at the l / t transition .",
    "2m1348 - 1344ab consists of a m4.5 primary with a t5.5 companion , at a distance @xmath212pc from the sun , and at separation of @xmath213au .",
    "an m3 primary and its l2 companion comprise the system 2m0525 - 7425ab , found lying at a distance @xmath214pc , and separated by @xmath215au .",
    "based on the matching proper motions and excellent agreement in distance estimates of the components , as well as on the fulfilled stability criteria , we conclude that both systems are genuine low - mass binaries . both primaries are found to have metallicities close to that of our sun , and lack h@xmath136 emission , allowing us to place the lower limits on the ages of the two systems at 1.5 gyr ( 2m0525 - 7425 ) and 4 gyr ( 2m1348 - 1344 ) .",
    "we also report the discovery of 2m0614 + 3950 , an ultracool dwarf with spectral type l9 , lying at a distance @xmath216pc .",
    "the three objects reported here add to the compendium of ultracool objects discovered by wise , which is certain to grow with the recent survey s all sky release .",
    "further characterization of the l / t transition dwarf and the components of the two new binary systems will provide stringent tests for understanding of ultracool atmospheres , as well as for the formation models of bds and bd binaries .",
