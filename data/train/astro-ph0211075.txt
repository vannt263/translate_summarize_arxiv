    "the selection of optically - bright sources inherent in a spectroscopically - identified sample means we are likely missing the high redshift tail of the distribution function .",
    "this tail could be skewing to higher redshifts as we move to fainter radio fluxes while the main body of the redshift distribution remains invariant .",

    "[ fig3 ] , the small increase in absolute magnitude at higher redshifts largely may be due to the apparent magnitude selection effects .    to verify that this result is not an effect of our flux limited radio sample , we construct a toy model whereby a schechter luminosity function with @xmath70 is evolved in luminosity , increasing with redshift as ( 1+@xmath28)@xmath71 from @xmath72 , and normalized by the volume element , @xmath73v .",
    "if we were to assume that radio luminosity is proportional to optical ( @xmath39-band ) luminosity , our observed range in @xmath62 would result in only sub-@xmath1 radio sources lying in our sample .",
    "however , if we apply our radio flux limit ( @xmath7440@xmath18jy ) to the model , we notice that we can detect only those radio sources with luminosities greater than @xmath1 at all redshifts @xmath75 , with 70% of the detectable sources in the observed volume lying outside of the equivalent @xmath62 range .",
    "we conclude that our observed result ( microjansky radio sources being hosted by similarly luminous optical galaxies ) is not a selection effect of our flux limited radio sample .",
    "it is not clear why the radio sources should all lie in high optical luminosity galaxies . at the higher redshifts the restricted absolute magnitude range can be understood from the selection effects :",
    "the lower cut - off is due to low optical luminosity galaxies being faint and not spectroscopically identified , and the upper cut - off reflects the small number of galaxies with optical magnitudes above the optical @xmath1 .",
    "however , at the lower redshifts there is no selection against low optical luminosity galaxies , and the absence of these galaxies is striking .",
    "many of the low optical luminosity galaxies at low redshifts have blue colors and substantial ongoing star formation that might be expected to produce substantial synchrotron emission ; thus , we might expect this population to correspond to a large part of the radio population .",
    "the absence of these objects argues that they are weak in the radio relative to their optical ( and ultraviolet ) luminosities .",
    "this presumably is the same effect that is seen in the local far - infrared ( fir)-radio correlation , which is not precisely linear ; low optical luminosity galaxies have lower radio luminosities than expected ( fitt et al .",
    "1988 ; cox et al .  1988 ; devereux & eales 1989 ) .",
    "one likely explanation is that small galaxies are not very effective radio sources because cosmic rays are more likely to escape by diffusion or convection ( chi & wolfendale 1990 ; condon et al .",
    "1991 . ) as our sources are selected from a flux - limited radio survey , low optical luminosity galaxies will be eliminated preferentially from our sample .",
    "this is a serious problem for radio estimates of the local star formation rate density ( e.g. , mobasher et al .",
    "1999 ; haarsma et al .",
    "2000 ) , as a substantial fraction of the ultraviolet luminosity density is generated by faint sub-@xmath1 galaxies at low redshifts ( e.g. , cowie , songaila , & barger 1999 ; wilson et al .",
    "the radio - based star formation rate density estimates already tend to lie at the high end of the values measured in the @xmath761 range , but despite this , the lowest redshift values must be substantially underestimated .",

    "[ fig5 ] we plot @xmath10  versus @xmath60 .",
    "the data are divided both according to observation technique ( triangles for jiggle map or raster mode , circles for photometry mode ) and according to submillimeter detection significance ( large solid symbols for @xmath6 , small open symbols for @xmath77 ) .",
    "analyses of submillimeter source reliability from scuba maps suggest a threshold of @xmath78 ( eales et al .",
    "2000 ; scott et al .  2002 ; borys et al .",
    "2002 ; cowie , barger , & kneib 2002 ) ; thus , we have enclose our @xmath12 sources in a second larger symbol . however , confidence in a targeted submillimeter  detection of a known optically - faint radio source is much higher than in a randomly detected submillimeter  source .",
    "for the 278 radio sources with submillimeter measurements , we expect only 0.5 spurious @xmath79 sources .      in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the error - weighted mean submillimeter fluxes ( open squares with @xmath80 uncertainties ) for five bins of 53 sources at successively fainter @xmath39-band magnitudes .",
    "the sample as a whole has an error - weighted mean @xmath10@xmath81mjy . since the distribution of the noise is not gaussian ( see cowie , barger , & kneib 2002 ) , the computed error may underestimate the true value .",
    "however , when monte carlo simulations of an equal number of randomly distributed sources are analyzed in the same way , the high significance of the result is confirmed .",
    "the optically - faint ( @xmath4 ) subsample is highly significant at @xmath82mjy , while the optically - bright ( @xmath5 ) subsample is also significant at @xmath83mjy .",
    "thus , the optically - faint radio sources are about two times more submillimeter luminous , on average , than the optically - bright radio sources .",
    "while we have somewhat oversampled the optically - faint radio sources with our targeted submillimeter photometry observations , the result is consistent when we consider only our contiguous submillimeter jiggle map regions .",
    "both the optically - faint and optically - bright radio - selected samples have higher submillimeter fluxes than x - ray - selected samples : for the 1  ms _ chandra _ deep field - north x - ray sample the error - weighted mean @xmath10@xmath84mjy ( barger et al .",

    "in fact , barger et al .",
    "( 2001b ) found that the submillimeter signal of their x - ray sample was largely driven by the subset of sources that overlapped with optically - faint radio sources .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the error - weighted mean submillimeter fluxes ( open squares with @xmath80 uncertainties ) at successively fainter 1.4ghz fluxes .",
    "the mean rises ( from @xmath10@xmath86mjy to 3mjy ) with increasing radio flux out to about 100@xmath18jy before dropping to @xmath10=1.2mjy for the brightest radio sources . for radio fluxes approaching the millijansky regime ,",
    "we expect an increasing contribution from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "this appears to be reflected in the trend of the means : the brightest radio sources in our sample are , on average , not the strongest submillimeter  emitters ( luminous agn typically have low @xmath26  ratios ) . since the ssa13 radio image is deeper than the hdf - n and ssa22 images , the number of radio sources probed in the submillimeter is not simply proportional to the radio source counts .",
    "however , the statistics should not be affected by this , unless significant large - scale structure dominates the small field covered to this depth .",
    "note that within the area probed by our submillimeter  observations , only two radio sources have radio fluxes higher than 1mjy .",
    "fifty of the radio sources in our sample are significantly ( @xmath6 ) detected individually in the submillimeter .",

    "[ fig8 ] we plot the logarithm of the error - weighted mean @xmath26  for the radio sources with spectroscopic redshifts and submillimeter measurements ( large open squares ) .",
    "the four @xmath6 submillimeter - detected sources with redshifts ( see   [ hizids ] ) are shown as dots .",
    "we include on the figure the tracks with redshift for three spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with different dust properties : arp  220 ( short dashed ) , a typical _ iue _ starburst ( solid ) , and a milky way type galaxy ( dotted ) .",
    "we have calculated these tracks using the dale et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and dale & helou ( 2002 ) empirical sed library .",
    "we also include three tracks from the literature ( dce00 ; cy00 ; yun & carilli 2002 ) that were derived using different galaxy samples and assumptions ; these tracks are the most widely used in millimetric redshift estimation .",
    "as would be expected from the luminosity selection , the error - weighted means follow the track of a quiescent to moderately star - forming galaxy at lower redshifts , while at higher redshifts the observations migrate to values @xmath80 below the arp  220 and cy00 tracks .",
    "( we note that yun , reddy , & condon ( 2001 ) found that sources like mrk  231 , whose agn has a radio luminosity comparable to its starburst luminosity , likely constitute a few to 10% of the submillimeter  population .",
    "such sources may lie preferentially in our radio - selected sample and hence have lowered our high - redshift ulig points by about 0.3 in dex . )    the radio power and the fir luminosity correlate locally with dust temperature , and there is no evidence that this relation varies significantly with redshift ( chapman et al .  2003 ,",
    "blain , barnard & chapman 2003 ) . given this ,",
    "the evolution in radio power and in @xmath26  with redshift show that for the microjansky radio population , millimetric redshift estimates at low redshifts are best made with a template intermediate between a milky way type template and a starburst template , and those at high redshifts ( @xmath111 ) with an arp  220 template .",
    "thus , we can apply the millimetric redshift technique to other radio - submillimeter  populations _ provided _ we have knowledge of the characteristic fir luminosity or redshift of the population before we choose a template sed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we showed that nearly all radio sources with redshifts have similar @xmath62 .",
    "this suggests that the optically - faint radio sources , rather than being low optical luminosity galaxies at moderate redshifts are instead luminous galaxies at @xmath111 , where the negative @xmath46-correction in the submillimeterprovides a nearly one - to - one mapping of submillimeter  flux to submillimeterluminosity . for the sources that are individually detected in the submillimeter , the @xmath10  fluxes ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) give fir luminosities that are at least as large as arp  220 ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "we therefore can use the arp  220 template in making millimetric redshift estimates for the optically - faint microjansky sources .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9]a we show @xmath26  versus 1.4ghz flux . the right - hand vertical axis shows the redshift that would be inferred from the arp  220 template . in fig .",
    "[ fig9]b we divide the sample into optically - bright and optically - faint subsamples .",
    "we can see from this figure that the optically - faint subsample does indeed move to higher redshift as we probe to fainter radio fluxes .",
    "there are four significant ( @xmath6 ) submillimeter sources in our sample with spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 ) ; all have @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath113 source has lyman @xmath117 and civ in emission , and the @xmath114 source is a broad - line quasar that was detected in the 100  ks _ chandra _ exposure of the ssa13 field ( barger et al .",
    "the redshifts of both sources are very close to their millimetric redshift estimates .",
    "the @xmath115 source shows strong balmer absorption features and [ ne iii ] in emission and was detected in the 1  ms _ chandra _ deep field - north exposure ( barger et al .",
    "the spectroscopic redshifts of this and the @xmath116 source are lower than their millimetric redshift estimates ( assuming an arp  220 sed , we find @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively ) . sources with dust temperatures cooler than the arp  220 @xmath120  k template will have true redshifts and fir luminosities lower than predicted ( see also yun & carilli 2002 ) .",
    "the @xmath115 galaxy exhibits a cool dust temperature ( @xmath7430k ) , similar to recently identified cold uligs from the firback 170@xmath18 m isophot survey ( chapman et al .",
    "2002c ) . in the case of the @xmath116 galaxy ,",
    "however , the dust would have to be prohibitively cold ( @xmath121  k ) for the millimetric redshift to match the spectroscopic identification .",
    "this source may therefore be a misidentification , with the true source being lensed by the bright foreground galaxy ( chapman et al .",
    "2002b ) .      in fig .  [ fig10 ]",
    "we plot @xmath10  versus spectroscopic ( solid triangles ) or millimetric ( solid circles ) redshift for the sources with submillimeter measurements .",
    "we also show a rough error bar based on the range in properties for local uligs relative to the arp  220 template .",
    "we have very little information on the spectroscopically - unidentified radio sources that are not individually detected in the submillimeter .",
    "we can put conservative limits on their redshifts by estimating millimetric redshifts from the cy00 relation and the @xmath122 submillimeter uncertainty .",
    "we denote these sources by the left - pointing arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "we can go one step further by determining a single average point for this marginally detected population from the ratio of the error - weighted mean submillimeter   flux and the error - weighted mean radio flux .",
    "we denote this point by a large open circle at @xmath123 on fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . as we have already removed all the @xmath10@xmath6 sources , submillimeter sources without radio counterparts",
    "are not present . since the steep submillimeter  source counts imply a large eddington bias , it is important not to overinterpret this result , but we note that it falls naturally within the distribution of the more robustly identified sources .    comparing the data with the track followed by a ulig with twice the luminosity of arp 220 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) , we can see the rapid rise in luminous fir sources with increasing redshift .",
    "below @xmath124 there are essentially no such objects , while above @xmath124 they are common .",
    "we presented optical and submillimeter ( jiggle and raster maps and photometry ) imaging and optical spectroscopy for a sample of microjansky radio sources detected in ultradeep 1.4ghz maps of the hdf - n , ssa13 , and ssa22 fields .",
    "our spectroscopic identifications for 169 of the sources in the hdf - n and ssa13 fields revealed a flat median redshift distribution across the entire microjansky regime probed .",
    "the identified sources show a remarkably narrow range in rest - frame absolute @xmath39-band magnitude that suggests they are chosen from approximately @xmath0 optical galaxies , regardless of redshift . at the higher redshifts",
    "the narrow range can be understood from selection effects , but at the lower redshifts there is no selection against low optical luminosity galaxies .",
    "thus , the absence of low optical luminosity galaxies in the sample argues that they are weak in the radio relative to their optical and ultraviolet luminosities , possibly due to small galaxies not being efficient at retaining the cosmic rays necessary to host microjansky radio sources .",
    "the fact that these galaxies are eliminated preferentially from a flux - limited radio survey poses a serious problem for radio estimates of the local star formation rate density since a substantial fraction of the ultraviolet luminosity density is generated by sub-@xmath0 galaxies at low redshifts .    from a statistical analysis of our submillimeter measurements for 278 of the microjansky radio sources in the hdf - n , ssa13 , and ssa22 fields",
    ", we found that optically - faint radio sources are about three times more submillimeter luminous , on average , than optically - bright radio sources , but both populations are , on average , very significantly detected in the submillimeter .",
    "fifty of the radio sources in our sample are significantly ( @xmath6 ) detected individually in the submillimeter ; 38 of these are optically faint ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we have spectroscopic redshifts for four of the @xmath5 submillimeter - detected sources , three of which are in the range @xmath1083.4 ; the fourth source is at @xmath116 and may be a misidentification .    to quantify the percentage of optically - bright and optically - faint radio sources that are significantly detected in the submillimeter , we considered only the regions of our survey that were mapped with scuba ( as opposed to the regions that were targeted with photometry ) .",
    "we found that @xmath88% of the radio - submillimeter population has @xmath4 .",
    "we also found that @xmath93% of the @xmath10@xmath11mjy ( @xmath12 ) sources in our fields are radio - identified .",
    "we used our spectroscopically - identified microjansky radio sample to determine the evolution with redshift in the radio power and hence the fir luminosity ( through the fir - radio correlation ) .",
    "we found that uligs or near - uligs are extremely rare at low redshifts but are relatively common by @xmath108 . in combination with the lower - bound selection effects",
    ", this means that we have a population which is rapidly changing with redshift but that is fairly tightly selected at each redshift . at low redshifts ( @xmath110 )",
    "we are selecting milky way type galaxies , at intermediate redshifts we are selecting ligs , and at high redshifts ( @xmath111 ) we are selecting only uligs or near - uligs . from the error - weighted mean @xmath26  flux ratio we see the same evolution with redshift , such that at lower redshifts the error - weighted means follow the track of a quiescent to moderately star - forming galaxy , while at higher redshifts the observations migrate to values consistent with arp  220 .",
    "thus , millimetric redshift estimates at low redshifts are best made with a template intermediate between a milky way type template and a starburst template , while at high redshifts ( @xmath111 ) an arp  220 template is appropriate . with this knowledge , we estimated millimetric redshifts or limits for all of the optically - faint microjansky radio sources in our sample with submillimeter measurements .",
