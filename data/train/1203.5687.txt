    "the possible existence of extra dimensions is an exciting prospect .",
    "ever since the first unification attempt by kaluza @xcite and klein @xcite , and then the advent of string theory , the role of these extra dimensions in shaping four dimensional physics has been emphasized @xcite .",
    "it could range from the presence of towers of excitations in the particle spectrum to the appearance of scalar fields in the form of compactification moduli . in the last fifteen years and in particular after the discovery of fundamental branes and the building of phenomenological brane - world models @xcite such as the one constructed by randall and sundrum @xcite , the emerging possibility of extra dimensional cosmology has been considered thoroughly . in brane",
    "cosmology , a brane configuration comprising one or several branes are embedded in a fixed extra dimensional background .",
    "this extra dimensional background is commonly assumed to be either a minkowski space - time or an anti de sitter universe ( for another type of background see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "these two cases receive strong motivation from either supergravity or string theory in more than four dimensions .",
    "when the brane is not taken as a probe brane , the extra dimensional geometry can be influenced by the matter fields on the brane and a back - reaction must be taken into account . in five dimensions ,",
    "these effects are taken into account by imposing the appropriate israel boundary condition @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for branes with a low enough tension , and/or no matter on their world surface , the branes whose dynamics are governed by their dirac - born - infeld action evolve in the extra dimensional background leading to a mirage cosmology on the brane @xcite .",
    "in particular , the cosmology on the brane defined by the induced metric can be non - trivial , e.g. inflation can result for instance .",
    "recently , the discovery of the acceleration of the universe @xcite has led to a reappraisal of the underlying assumptions of cosmology",
    ". in particular , the cosmological principle , which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales , has been under scrutiny @xcite . as a result",
    ", tolman - bondi models of the universe where the earth would lie close to the centre of an inhomogeneous universe have been considered @xcite . along these lines",
    ", it seems to be timely to question the usual hypothesis that extra dimensions should be a symmetric space . in 5d ,",
    "homogeneous and anisotropic brane models have been extensively studied @xcite , in particular with the aim of extending wald s theorem which states that a space - time with a positive cosmological constant and a matter density satisfying the strong energy condition always isotropises @xcite .",
    "other approaches such as in @xcite tackle the issue of isotropisation of three large dimensions in the brane gas cosmology framework by allowing an arbitrary amount of initial anisotropy .",
    "there it was found that the anisotropy reaches a maximum early in the evolution and then approaches zero at later times .    here and in the following",
    ", we will consider that the universe is a 3-brane embedded in an extra dimensional space with no homogeneity at all .",
    "we study the dynamics of the brane as it responds to the extra - dimensional cosmology . to simplify matters , we assume that the @xmath0 dimensional space - time is a matter dominated , inhomogeneous and isotropic tolman bondi universe with a special role played by the origin of space . on the brane ,",
    "the induced metric is both inhomogeneous and anisotropic . in principle",
    ", we should also introduce matter fields on the brane and study the back reaction problem . as a first step",
    ", we will assume that the brane is a probe and as a result we only investigate the mirage cosmology on the brane .",
    "it turns out that the dynamics are governed by non - linear partial differential equations whose long time behaviour can be analysed in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "we find that the asymptotic behaviour of the induced metric around the origin becomes isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "this isotropisation on the brane is in fact an attractor behaviour .",
    "of course our model does not directly apply to our 4d universe .",
    "strong constraints on isotropy during big bang nucleosynthesis should be taken into account @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the dynamics would be certainly changed by the presence of matter on the brane .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that an isotropic and homogeneous space - time emerging from an initially inhomogeneous and anisotropic universe around the origin of space is certainly appealing .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in a first part",
    ", we describe branes in a tolman bondi space - time .",
    "in section iii , we study the mirage cosmology of a neutral brane in a tolman bondi universe . in section iv",
    ", we simplify the dynamics and focus on the vicinity of the origin of space . in this case , the resulting inhomogeneous and anisotropic cosmology converges to a 4d friedmann - lemaitre universe .",
    "our results are confirmed numerically .",
    "we consider the dynamics of a single uncharged 3-brane described by its world - volume action @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the brane tension and @xmath3 is the induced metric on the brane related to the extra dimensional metric @xmath4 by [ inducedmetric ] g_= g_ab where @xmath5 are the brane coordinates and @xmath6 the brane embedding .",
    "previous studies have mainly concentrated on the embedding of 3-branes in minkowski or anti de sitter space - times . here",
    "we concentrate on the possibility that matter may exist in the extra - dimensions and may lead to a dynamical time evolution of the extra - dimensional geometry . in the extra - dimensions ( the bulk ) ,",
    "the action is simply @xmath7 notice the dimension of @xmath8 is @xmath9 .",
    "the matter action may comprise ordinary matter like a pressure - less fluid .",
    "we will also assume that the distribution of matter in the bulk could be inhomogeneous , i.e. the cosmological principle could be violated in the bulk . if this is the case , then the brane geometry will be both anisotropic and inhomogeneous .",
    "even if the cosmological principle is satisfied in the bulk , we will find that the brane geometry is generically anisotropic .    in order to retrieve gravity in the 4d sense at least in the low energy - long distance regime in a way akin to the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) model @xcite",
    ", one may include an einstein - hilbert term on the brane and couple 4d gravity to matter on the brane @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ricci scalar of the induced metric on the brane and @xmath12 the 4d gravitational constant .",
    "here @xmath13 is the contribution from the matter species living on the brane .    in the following",
    "we will treat the simpler case where the effects of brane gravity and matter are neglected . in this mirage cosmology setting where the dynamics on the 3-brane are simply due to its probe nature and its motion in the bulk , we will be able to analyse interesting phenomena such as the isotropisation of the 4-d geometry .",
    "of course , the fact that we do not take into account @xmath14 means that our model can not describe the physics of the universe since big bang nucleosynthesis . to do so , a full analysis of the model involving the total action @xmath15 must be tackled .",
    "this interesting possibility is left for future work . in the following ,",
    "we only consider the dynamics driven by the brane action @xmath16 .",
    "tolman - bondi space - times in extra - dimensions have been extensively studied @xcite . here",
    "we review some of their salient properties .",
    "we consider a @xmath0-dimensional universe filled with a pressureless fluid and a spatially dependent energy density @xmath17 whose metric is given by the extension of the tolman - bondi solution to @xmath0-dimensions @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the metric on the @xmath20-sphere , i.e there are @xmath21 angular coordinates .",
    "the einstein equations yield @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the time - dependence of the metric is specified by the friedmann equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 and where @xmath26 is an arbitrary dimensionless function of the radius @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath28 , the tolman - bondi universe reduces to a friedmann - lemaitre model with no inhomogeneity if we assume a cosmically simultaneous big - bang time , i.e. @xmath29constant independently of @xmath27 .",
    "the big - bang time appears as an integration function @xmath30 so that each shell has its own big - bang time , a feature which differs from what happens in the friedmann - lemaitre limit unless @xmath31 is explicitly chosen to be @xmath27-independent . in this case",
    "we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the scale factor of the friedmann - lemaitre universe .",
    "the mass function @xmath34 is defined by @xmath35 or equivalently @xmath36 where @xmath17 has dimension @xmath0 . in the flat friedmann - lemaitre case , we have @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ". we can integrate the friedmann equation to obtain @xmath39 such that at @xmath40 , @xmath41 . choosing the time origin to be @xmath42",
    ", we can write @xmath43 we then obtain @xmath44 which specifies the homogeneous friedmann - lemaitre models .    when @xmath45 , we can follow the approach of debnath and chakraborty @xcite where the inverse of the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann ] ) is used to obtain @xmath46 @xmath47 \\nonumber \\\\ - \\frac{2}{n+1 }   m^{-1/2 } r^{(n+1)/2 } ~_2f_1\\left[\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1+n}{2(n-1)},\\frac{3n-1}{2(n-1 ) } , - \\frac{r^{n-1}f}{m}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where at @xmath40 , @xmath41 . we can now simply use @xmath48 to obtain the spatial derivative of @xmath49 @xmath50 \\times   \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\frac{r^n}{m}\\left(f+\\frac{m}{r^n-1}\\right ) \\left[(1+n)\\frac{f'}{f}-2 \\frac{m'}{m}\\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which we can obtain @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath52 and therefore @xmath53 , ( [ solt2 ] ) simplifies considerably and we obtain @xmath54 which gives an explicit description of the five - dimensional geometry .",
    "when @xmath55 , we find that @xmath56 corresponding to a scale factor growing in @xmath57 .    in the following , we will consider models where @xmath58 vanishes at the origin of space @xmath59 in such a way that @xmath60 close to the origin . as @xmath61 there , this implies that @xmath58 must go to zero faster than @xmath62 locally .",
    "this guarantees that the curvature vanishes locally in a neighbourhood of the origin and the extra - dimensional geometry is locally the one of a flat friedmann - lemaitre model .",
    "in particular , this choice specifies that the origin , on top of being the centre of the distribution of matter , is a special point of space where the geometry is nearly homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the geometry at large far away from the origin remains isotropic but deviates from homogeneity as soon as @xmath58 becomes relevant in the friedmann equation .",
    "in this section we will construct the mirage cosmology set up , first describing the higher dimensional embedding of our 3-brane and second , by deriving the dynamical equations that rule the induced 4 dimensional metric .",
    "we consider a d3 brane embedded in the tolman - bondi background in @xmath0 dimensions that we have presented in the last section .",
    "the extra dimensional matter distribution is comoving with the energy - momentum tensor t^ab=(r , t ) u^a u^b , where matter particles are comoving in the bulk and spherically distributed with @xmath63 . in order to preserve spherical symmetry of the induced matter distribution on the brane with the induced energy momentum tensor t_= t_ab , where @xmath6 is the embedding of the brane with coordinates @xmath5 in the tolman - bondi universe with coordinates @xmath64",
    ", we choose to embed the brane as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the brane coordinates .",
    "matter is then spherically symmetric on the brane with t_= ( x^0,x^1 ) u_u _ , where u_= u_a , is explicitly @xmath68 as @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this choice of embedding implies that the 3-brane corresponds to a two dimensional cross - section of the @xmath20-sphere . using the @xmath20-rotational invariance",
    ", we can always rotate the cross - section to align it with a planar section of the @xmath20 sphere parameterised by the angles @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",

    "the induced metric is neither homogeneous nor isotropic there .",
    "an observer analysing the geometry of its local patch would see the universe as both inhomogeneous and anisotropic .",
    "this is the case despite the fact that matter as seen on the brane is spherically symmetrically distributed according to @xmath17 .",
    "we will study the long term dynamics of the geometry around the origin and see when the local geometry isotropises and becomes homogeneous up to points where the curvature effects in the bulk measured by @xmath58 can not be neglected anymore .",
    "the dynamics of the brane , solely governed by its world volume action and depending on the tension @xmath2 , depends on the induced metric . with the chosen embedding",

    "this isotropisation process is extremely interesting in view of the possible existence of extra dimension and the strongly motivated possibility that matter , even cosmological matter , could exist non - only in 4d but also in the extra dimensions . in this case , the dynamical interplay between the brane degrees of freedom and the extra dimensions becomes more complex than in the usual case of an extra dimensional symmetric space , e.g. anti de sitter or minkowski .",
    "indeed , one may envisage situations where both matter would exist on the brane and in the extra dimensions , with possible exchanges between them . in this paper",
