    "the central 200  pc of our galaxy is a unique region that harbours many remarkable objects  including several potential sites of effective particle acceleration .",
    "non - thermal emission ( particularly in the radio , x - ray and @xmath0-ray bands ) can be used to trace the energetic particle populations of this region .",
    "x - ray and radio observations of synchrotron emission provide information on the product of the local magnetic field energy density and the density of relativistic electrons .",
    "the flux of inverse compton @xmath0-rays , on the other hand , is proportional to the radiation field density ( and the electron density ) .",
    "the combination of @xmath0-ray and x - ray measurements therefore provides a powerful tool for probing both magnetic field strength and energetic particle content .",
    "moreover , @xmath0-rays provide an effective tracer for hadronic particles : proton - proton interactions in the interstellar medium lead to the production and decay of pions and hence @xmath0-ray production",
    ". the combination of @xmath0-ray measurements with tracers of atomic and molecular material may be the _ only _ way to effectively trace energetic hadrons in our galaxy .",
    "the usefulness of @xmath0-ray observations has traditionally been limited by poor angular resolution and modest sensitivity .",

    "during 2004 , detection of a compact source of vhe @xmath0-rays close to the gc was claimed almost simultaneously by groups using three imaging air - cherenkov telescope ( iact ) systems : cangaroo  @xcite , whipple  @xcite and the partially complete h.e.s.s .",

    "several radiation mechanisms have been discussed for these three objects .",
    "plausible mechanisms include inverse compton scattering of energetic electrons , the decay of pions produced in the interactions of energetic hadrons with the interstellar medium or dense radiation fields and finally curvature radiation of ultra - high energy protons close to sgr a@xmath7 . for some production scenarios ,",

    "[ fig2 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , maps of cs ( j=1 - 0 ) emission from @xcite have been used to estimate the column density of the gc clouds .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0-ray emission to column density provides a measure of the density of tev cosmic rays ( crs ) in the galactic centre region . assuming that the locally measured cr spectrum is valid in the gc",
    ", we can predict the expected @xmath20-decay @xmath0-ray spectrum in the central molecular zone . fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows this expectation as a grey shaded box .",
    "the measured data show a significantly harder energy spectrum than this expectation , indicating an excess of high energy hadrons in the gc , relative to the solar neighbourhood .",

    "the grey shaded box illustrates the expected flux for the gc region from the interactions of crs with a spectrum identical to that measured at the earth .",
    "the width of the box indicates the uncertainty on the total molecular mass of the cmz ( figure reproduced from @xcite ) . ]    from the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it appears that the ratio of @xmath0-ray emission to molecular density varies with galactic longitude , with a pronounced dip at @xmath21 .",
    "the implied non - uniform cr density can be explained if crs injected close to sgr a have not yet had time to diffuse out to @xmath21 . assuming a diffusion coefficient of @xmath22 , the approximate value in the galactic disk at tev energies , an angular displacement of @xmath23 at the distance of the gc corresponds to a diffusion time of @xmath2410@xmath25 years , close to the age of the snr sgr  a  east  @xcite .",
    "the energy required to fill the central 200 parsecs with crs with the observed density ( extrapolating the measured h.e.s.s .",
    "spectrum down to 1  gev ) is @xmath26 ergs , remarkably close to the cr energy input required from a typical galactic snr in the paradigm of cr acceleration in these objects . a historical burst of activity in sgr  a@xmath7 also provides a natural explanation for the observed cr excess .",
    "g0.9 + 0.1 is a composite radio snr with a clear ` core plus shell ' morphology ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "observations with chandra  @xcite and xmm  @xcite revealed hard x - ray emission from the core and weak ( likely thermal ) emission from the snr shell .",
    "the characteristic softening of the x - ray spectrum with distance from the core indicates the likely plerionic nature of this source , although no radio pulsar has been identified ( likely due to the large dispersion associated with the gc region ) .",
    "vhe @xmath0-ray emission coincident with g0.9 + 0.1 was discovered by the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration in 2005  @xcite .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the position of the h.e.s.s .",
    "source in comparison to radio measurements .",
    "the vhe emission is unresolved by h.e.s.s . and",
    "an upper limit of @xmath27 on the rms size of the emission region has been derived .",
    "this limit allows us to exclude a @xmath0-ray origin in the shell of the snr and strongly suggests a common plerionic origin of the @xmath0-ray and x - ray emission , arising respectively from inverse compton scattering and synchrotron radiation of energetic electrons within the nebula .",
    "pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) are prominent members of the vhe @xmath0-ray source catalogue .",
    "recent @xmath0-ray observations with h.e.s.s . of known x - ray pwn such as vela - x  @xcite and msh15 - 5_2 _  @xcite show close correlations between x - ray and vhe @xmath0-ray emission .",

    "the h.e.s.s . survey of the inner galaxy  @xcite , combined with deep exposures on targets such as the gc and rxj1713.7 - 3946  @xcite has resulted in the detection of many extended ( @xmath29 ) @xmath0-ray sources without clear counterparts at other wavelengths .",
