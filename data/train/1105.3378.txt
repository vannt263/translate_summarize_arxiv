    "since its discovery @xcite the shapley supercluster has been the object of considerable interest because it potentially contributes significantly to the velocity field in the local universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and because the existence of extremely massive objects such as shapley constrains the amplitude of the initial fluctuation field , and possibly the hypothesis that this field was gaussian .",
    "recent studies suggest that the shapley supercluster contains a few times @xmath9 , is overdense by a factor of order 2 , and is receding from us at about 15,000 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "these conclusions are based on studies of the motions of galaxies @xcite and estimates of the masses of x - ray clusters in this region @xcite .",
    "in addition , the fact that this region is over - abundant in rich clusters also allows an estimate of its mass @xcite , not all of which may actually be bound to the system @xcite . whereas the other methods are observationally grounded , the mass estimate from this last method ( i.e. from the over - abundance of rich clusters ) follows from the assumption that the initial fluctuation field was gaussian . here , we refine this estimate of the total mass of shapley and compare it with the answer to the question : what is the probability distribution of the mass of the most massive object , having the volume of shapley , if it formed from gaussian initial conditions ?",
    "we use extreme value statistics to address this question .",

    "we run a percolation algorithm on this catalog to identify the largest supercluster in this region .",
    "to do so , we neglect the peculiar velocity of the clusters : i.e. , each cluster is assigned coordinates @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are its celestial coordinates and @xmath17 . figure  [ fig : ragone ] shows the pie diagram of these systems .",

    ", we have also applied our percolation analysis to an x - ray survey of this region , which shows 41 extended sources @xcite . a link length of @xmath35  mpc links 8 clusters , and returns a total mass in x - ray clusters of @xmath36  m@xmath20 , where we estimated the mass of each cluster as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite .. ] with this recipe , only 5 out of the 8 members have masses larger than @xmath19  m@xmath20 .",
    "it is reassuring that these numbers are smaller than those of ragone et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , because this sample of x - ray clusters with known redshifts is clearly incomplete @xcite .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we use the cluster catalogue from ragone et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , rather than from the x - ray data .",
    "the previous section suggests that the total mass of the shapley supercluster is at least @xmath40 . in this section",
    ", we make a rather different estimate of the total mass . according to ragone et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the inner @xmath41mpc of shapley centered on a3558 contains 58 galaxy systems : 19 of these have mass greater than @xmath42 . for such high masses , it is reasonable to equate each cluster with a single halo . integrating the halo mass function @xcite from this lower limit to infinity",
    "shows that the expected number in randomly placed spheres of this radius is only @xmath43 .",
    "this number depends on @xmath2 : reducing @xmath2 to 0.7 changes the expected count to 1.77 ; increasing to 0.9 makes the count 3.5 .",
    "neither of these numbers is close to that observed .",
    "however , if shapley is an overdense region , then the relevant comparison is not with the expected counts in a region of average density , but one which is overdense @xcite . in theories of structure formation from gaussian initial conditions ,",
    "massive halos are expected to be more abundant in dense regions , and the mix of halos is expected to also be different . in dense regions , the halo mass function is expected to be top - heavy @xcite , so this is an immediate signal that shapley must be overdense in dark matter @xcite .",
    "measurements in the sdss indicate that the halo mass function in regions which are overdense in galaxies is indeed top - heavy @xcite , so it is interesting to ask if this effect is sufficient to explain the existence of a region like shapley .     as a function of the total mass of the supercluster .",
    "the expected number increases as @xmath2 increases . ]    to make this estimate , we will make the crude assumption that shapley is spherical , despite the fact that it is not , as we have shown in the previous section .",
    "however , by considering the most massive 19 clusters within a distance of @xmath41mpc from a3558 , rather than the system identified with the percolation analysis , we expect to make this assumption more reasonable .",
    "we will return to the issue of triaxiality in the final discussion section .",
    "let @xmath44 denote the mean number of halos with mass above threshold in a region which has volume @xmath45 and contains mass @xmath46 ( so the mass overdensity is @xmath47 ) : @xmath48 this number increases as @xmath46 increases ; the precise dependence can be computed following arguments in sheth & tormen ( 2002 ) , which build on the work of mo & white ( 1996 ) , and are within the framework of the excursion set approach @xcite . will yield large - scale halo bias factors which are the same as those of mo & white ( 1996 ) ; these are known to be inaccurate @xcite .",
    "our procedure produces bias factors which are in substantially better agreement with simulations .",
    "] this approach requires an estimate of the relation between the overdensity in linear theory , @xmath49 and the actual nonlinear overdensity @xmath50 .",

    "now , @xmath53 can be estimated using the same excursion set framework as is used in the calculation of @xmath44 @xcite . alternatively , on large scales",
    ", it could also be estimated using perturbation theory @xcite . on these large scales ,",
    "these two approaches are in good agreement : the shape of @xmath53 which results is reasonably well approximated by a lognormal @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the variance in linear theory on scale @xmath45 . for @xmath61 and @xmath62mpc@xmath1",
    "our linear power spectrum yields @xmath63 .",
    "figure  [ fig : meann ] shows how @xmath44 , computed following sheth & tormen ( 2002 ) , increases with total mass @xmath46 for our three choices of @xmath2 .",
    "this , in equation  ( [ pmnv ] ) , allows us to constrain the expected values of @xmath46 .",

    "figure  [ fig : shapley7 - 9 ] shows @xmath64 for @xmath66 ( top ) and @xmath67 ( bottom ) . in effect , these are estimates of the total mass , and hence overdensity , of shapley .",
    "notice that these distributions shift slightly with @xmath2 .",
    "the sense of the trend is easily understood : when @xmath2 is small then massive halos are rare , so the environment must be that much more extreme to produce the observed number of clusters . at the peak values",
    "@xmath68 the associated overdensities are @xmath69 so the linear theory overdensities are @xmath70 , making @xmath71 . these indicate that shapley is not particularly unusual .",
    ", our estimate of @xmath72 is close to that of muoz & loeb ( 2008 ) ; our estimates of the total mass differ because they used a substantially larger volume estimate than do we . ]",
    "we argue in section  [ sec : extremeic ] that to estimate the initial ` peak height ' , it may be more appropriate to use @xmath73 rather than @xmath74 .",
    "this yields higher values : @xmath75 .",
    "all these results are summarized in table [ tab : ssc ] .",
    "it is remarkable that our analytic estimate of the total mass is so similar to that derived by ragone et al .",
    "( 2006 ) using mock catalogs : for @xmath67 ( the value in their mocks ) , our estimate is only 10% larger than theirs .",
    "upon evaluating an integral that is very similar to the one which defines @xmath44 , the excursion set approach also yields estimates of the typical mass fractions in such clusters . if we use @xmath76 to denote this fraction , then @xmath77 at the peak values shown in the figures , @xmath78 ( 0.14 , 0.18 , 0.22 ) for @xmath61 . since",
    "the total observed mass in these 19 clusters is @xmath79 , these mass fractions suggest total shapley masses of @xmath80 .",
    "these values are larger than the peak values from the excursion set approach , because the expression above assumes that the observed number of clusters is equal to @xmath44 , whereas it is actually larger by a factor of @xmath81 .",
    "increasing @xmath82 by these factors reduces the estimated total shapley mass to @xmath83 .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with our estimate above , which was based on the fact that 19 massive clusters were observed , but no other information about their masses was used , though the agreement is best for @xmath65 .",
    "and the sixth densest of @xmath84 randomly placed cells having the same volume as shapley ( dashed and dotted ) , when @xmath65 . ]",
    "randomly placed shapley - sized cells ( dashed ) on @xmath2.,title=\"fig : \" ]   randomly placed shapley - sized cells ( dashed ) on @xmath2.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "it is interesting to compare the mass estimates derived above with the mass associated with the densest of @xmath54 randomly placed cells , where @xmath54 is the ratio of shapley s volume to that in which it was found .",
    "if the masses agree , then this would suggest that although shapley is extreme , it is not unusually so .",
    "note that , despite the similarity , this is a different question from the one which is more often asked : is the region containing shapley the densest of its size in the entire sphere centered on our galaxy which contains shapley ?    given a total survey volume , the mass of the densest of @xmath54 cells placed randomly in this volume ( i.e. , large compared to the cells )  which we will estimate below  is certainly smaller than the mass associated with the question that is more usually asked .",
    "this is because one might think of this densest region as a particularly carefully placed cell . in particular",
    ", one would have to throw a large number of cells ( compared to @xmath54 ) before one lands in just the right position to find this densest region .",
    "we discuss the difference between these two extreme value estimates in section  [ peaks ] .",
    "of course , both require an assumption about the volume within which shapley was found .",
    "we will assume that this is a sphere with radius @xmath4mpc , and will discuss how our results depend on this choice shortly ( e.g. following equation  [ eq : extremevalue ] ) .",
    "if @xmath85 denotes the probability that the most massive of the @xmath86 regions of volume @xmath87 that are within @xmath4mpc is less massive than @xmath46 , then @xmath85 must equal the probability that each of the @xmath88 cells is less massive than @xmath46 .",
    "thus @xmath89 and , by taking the derivative , @xmath90 appendix  [ independence ] discusses this approximation further .",
    "before we use this expression , notice that if @xmath91 denotes the median value of the expected mass , i.e. , that at which @xmath92 , then @xmath93 \\approx -p(>m_{1/2}|v ) , \\label{eq : extremevalue}\\ ] ] where we have assumed that @xmath94 in the tail of the distribution .",
    "this shows that the mass returned by our approach is approximately the same as that given by setting @xmath95 ( because @xmath96 is of order unity ) , which makes intuitive sense .",
    "it also illustrates that the mass estimate depends on @xmath54 : if the large @xmath46 tail falls exponentially , then @xmath97 .",
    "i.e. , the expected mass increases approximately as @xmath98 , so the dependence on @xmath54 , and hence on our assumption that @xmath45 is the comoving volume within @xmath4mpc , is weak .",
    "this means that one can devise a test which asks if the survey volume which is required to make a certain mass object the densest of its type does indeed contain only one such object .",
    "alternatively , if the survey volume is known but the mass is not , then the assumption that the object is the most massive actually yields an estimate of its mass . we will show shortly that shapley passes either of these tests for currently acceptable values of @xmath2 .    finally , we note that the mass estimate can be rather precise . if we use @xmath99 to denote the value of the mass below which @xmath100 of the probability lies , namely the value at @xmath101 , then , for an exponentially falling distribution in @xmath46 , @xmath102 , so @xmath103 for @xmath104 the fractional error on @xmath91 is 0.19 , and it decreases as @xmath98 increases .      to illustrate the approach , suppose that the pdf associated with scale @xmath45 is a gaussian with variance @xmath105 .",
    "then the extreme - value mass and survey volume are related , through equation  ( [ eq : extremevalue ] ) , by @xmath106 where @xmath49 is related to @xmath107 by equation  ( [ scapprox ] ) .",
    "the previous section argued that , if @xmath65 , then , for an object like shapley , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "these values in equation  ( [ erfcl ] ) imply @xmath110 .",
    "since this is substantially smaller than 270 , there should be at least 6 other shapley - like objects within @xmath4mpc of us .",
    "this is unlikely . alternatively , requiring @xmath111 means @xmath112 . for @xmath108 ,",
    "the associated nonlinear overdensity is @xmath113 making the estimated mass @xmath114 .",
    "this is about 0.18  dex larger than that from the excursion set approach , indicating that although shapley is a rich concentration , it is not more extreme than one would expect on the basis of random statistics .",
    "therefore , it would not be unexpected to find an even more extreme object of its volume in the local universe .",
    "one can improve on these estimates by noting that if one is using the linear pdf , then the appropriate smoothing scale is not @xmath45 but the associated initial scale @xmath115 , and @xmath105 should also be computed on the scale @xmath115 rather than @xmath45 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since @xmath105 is smaller than before , @xmath72 will be larger , and we now require @xmath116 the result is that @xmath117 .",
    "thus , shapley is consistent with being the densest of @xmath118 cells , so we should not be surprised if we find another comparable or even more massive object in a survey that is only slightly deeper . alternatively ,",
    "if we set @xmath111 , then equation  ( [ betterl ] ) requires shapley s mass to be @xmath119 , which is in good agreement with the excursion set analysis .    .estimated initial fluctuation height and mass of the shapley supercluster .",
    "the values listed in columns  2 and  3 show that this large concentration of galaxies is not unlikely . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we discussed a number of methods for estimating the masses of extreme objects in the universe , and applied them to two of the most dramatic objects in the local universe : the shapley supercluster and the sloan great wall .",
    "we used a percolation analysis to define these systems , and illustrated how our results depended on the link - length ( @xmath120 or @xmath121mpc ) used to define it .    in the case of shapley ,",
    "our estimate of the mass comes from combining estimates of the masses of its constituents with an excursion set analysis of the depedence of the halo mass function on the density of the local environment .",
    "unfortunately , this was not possible in the case of the wall , since mass estimates of its constituents are not available . in this case",
    ", we combined the excursion set analysis with a halo - model interpretation of its constituent groups , themselves identified from ( optical ) sdss redshift survey data .",
    "unfortunately , this method can not currently be applied to shapley , since it lies outside the sdss footprint .",
    "this is also why we have not included results from the recent analyses of the wall by einasto et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011 )  but we hope to do so soon .    we compared these mass estimates with that expected for the densest object in an appropriately defined ` local ' universe , and argued that the existence of shapley is easily explained by currently popular models of structure formation ( figures  [ fig : shapley8 ] and  [ fig : shapley7 - 9 ] ) ; its mass ( @xmath122 ) is consistent with it being the most massive object of its volume ( @xmath123mpc@xmath1 ) within @xmath4mpc . on the other hand ,",
    "the sloan great wall ( figure  [ fig : gw ] ) is difficult to explain , especially if the amplitude of the initial fluctuation field was at the low end of currently accepted values ( figures  [ fig : sdsswall8 ] and  [ fig : sdsswall9 ] ) .",
    "its mass @xmath124 is larger than expected for the most massive object of its volume @xmath125mpc@xmath1 within @xmath8 ( where the two numbers are for defining the wall using link - lengths of @xmath120 or @xmath121mpc respectively ) .",
    "if @xmath65 , then insertion of the excursion set estimate of its mass in our extreme value statistics calculation suggests that it must be the densest object of its volume within the hubble volume . an analysis which combines the excursion set estimate of the initial overdensity associated with the wall , @xmath126 , with the assumption that this fluctuation was the largest peak in the initial conditions , leads to a similar conclusion ( figure  [ fig : expk ] ) .",
    "we are hesitant to make strong statements about whether this makes the great wall inconsistent with gaussian initial conditions with acceptable values of @xmath2 , primarily because our current numbers are based on assuming the wall is spherically symmetric when it clearly is not .",
    "for this reason , we are in the process of extending both our methods  the excursion set and extreme value statistics analyses  to account for this . here",
    "we are aided by the fact that the wall itself is not virialized .",
    "hence , we can use the simple parametrization of triaxial collapse from lam & sheth ( 2008 ) to generalize equation  ( [ scapprox ] ) for the mapping between nonlinear and linear overdensity .",
    "this can then be used in our excursion set analysis . with this estimate of initial overdensity and shape in hand",
    ", we can modify our extreme value statistics calculation by replacing the number density of initial density of peaks of specified scale and height by adding the constraint that comes from specifying the shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is the subject of work in progress .",
    "our results suggest that the sloan great wall is about 5 times the volume and about the same factor times the mass of the shapley supercluster ( we have used the larger mass and volume estimates of the wall ) .",
    "so one might wonder if shapley is about the sixth most extreme object of its volume within @xmath8 .",
    "it is straightforward to extend our application of extreme value statistics to address this question .",
    "in particular , the same logic which leads to equation  ( [ p1mv ] ) implies that the expected distribution of the mass of the @xmath127th densest region is @xmath128^{n-1 }              \\nonumber\\\\            & & \\qquad\\qquad \\times \\quad p(<m|v)^{n - n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the dotted curve in figure  [ fig : shapley8 ] shows this expression , evaluated with @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 .",
    "this shows that shapley could easily be the sixth most massive object within @xmath8 if @xmath132 . of course",
    ", it is trivial to extend this to our extreme value treatment of peaks : one simply replaces @xmath133 .",
    "the appendix discusses how to modify this approach to account for the clustering of peaks .",
    "similarly , one can write down expressions for the joint probability distribution of the masses of e.g. , shapley and the great wall , if we require one to be the @xmath134th and the other the @xmath135th most extreme object of its type ( recall they may have different values of @xmath105 ) in the same survey volume ",
    "although we have not reproduced them here .",
    "one of the surprises of these analyses is , perhaps , the precision of the mass estimates it returns : typically , these are of order 15% , both for the excursion set and the extreme value statistics approaches .",
    "although we provided some analysis for why this is so ( equation  [ precision ] ) , it would have been nice to test our mass estimates by combining the motions of the clusters in these systems with an infall model .",
    "however , because the shapley supercluster and the sloan great wall are both far from round ( e.g. section  [ shapley ] ) , estimates based on the spherical collapse model are inappropriate .",
    "therefore , we are currently in the process of developing an infall model based on the assumption of a triaxial collapse .",
    "the precision of the mass estimates derives from the fact that the extreme fluctuations we are considering are from gaussian random fields , in which extreme fluctuations are rare , so the distribution of events on the tail will be similar to one another .",
    "however , it is almost certain that , at least for the extreme value statistics calculation , this is more generic .",
    "this is because a large class of initial distributions have , as their limiting extreme value statistic , a double - exponential form @xcite . in the astrophysical context , this fisher - tippet or gumbel distribution , and the study of extreme value statistics in general , has a long history in the study of the brightest galaxies in clusters @xcite .",
    "our work suggests that extreme value statistics may continue to provide insight into the study of the largest structures in the universe",
    ".    in particular , it would be interesting to use this approach to see if the sizes of the largest voids , or the masses of the most massive clusters or superclusters ( e.g. luparello et al .",
    "2011 ; schirmer et al . 2011 ; yaryura et al .",
    "2011 ) , are consistent with the hypothesis that the initial fluctuation field was gaussian .",
    "to use our approach for more generic initial conditions , one must know how the halo mass function depends on the large scale environment and one must have a model for the nonlinear probability distribution function . for non - gaussian initial conditions of the local type , such models have recently become available @xcite .",

    "the calculation of extreme value statistics reduces to one of writing the probability that , of @xmath127 draws from a distribution , none are above a certain value .",
    "this raises the question of whether or not the draws can be assumed to be independent picks . for the spatial statistics we are considering here , in which each cell represents a pick , and",
    "the total volume is the sum of the cells , the answer is clearly ` no ' because there are correlations between the cells . on the other hand , since the correlations decrease with cell separation , most cells will only be strongly correlated with a few nearby cells . moreover , since we will generally be interested in large cells , even nearby cells are likely to be only weakly correlated .",
    "so the assumption of independence , may in fact be quite good .",
    "the question is : are extreme value statistics likely to be distorted by even these weak correlations ?",
    "after all , the whole point of such stastistics is that they are sensitive to the tails of the distribution , and these are where ( fractional ) changes to the distribution will be largest . in what follows , we quantify this effect .",
    "to proceed , we need an expression for the joint distribution of @xmath127-draws .",
    "we will first use a multivariate gaussian to illustrate the argument , and then discuss possible generalizations . if @xmath136 denotes the value of the field at position @xmath134 , then the multivariate gaussian distribution is specified by the covariance matrix @xmath137 , the elements of which are @xmath138 ( we are assuming @xmath139 for all @xmath134 ) . in our case",
    ", @xmath140 will be a function of the separation @xmath141 between cells @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "namely , @xmath142 and we have allowed for the fact that the cells of interest at position @xmath134 may have a different size than those at position @xmath135 . in the main text we were primarily interested in the case @xmath143 . if the @xmath144 are large , and/or the separation between cells is large , then @xmath137 will be close to diagonal , so the @xmath127-point distribution will be well - approximated by the product of @xmath127 1-point distribution functions . as a result ,",
    "@xmath145 this is the approximation used in equation  ( [ p1cum ] ) of the main text .",
    "the leading order correction to this can be obtained by writing this in terms of integrals above @xmath146 , and then using previous results for high peaks or dense patches @xcite to evaluate the result , which shows that the expression gets a correction factor which , to lowest order , depends on the two - point correlation function of regions above @xmath146 .    in practice , the present day 1-point distribution function is no longer gaussian . however , on large scales , it may be a good approximation to assume that there is a monotonic mapping between the nonlinear overdensity and the linear one .",
    "e.g. , the main text assumes that this mapping is well approximated by a lognormal .",
    "if one assumes that this is also true of the @xmath127-point distribution function , then we have a fully specified model of the nonlinear @xmath127-point function , expressed in terms of the initial gaussian covariance matrix .",
    "now , the extreme value statistics care about the cumulative distribution : the monotonicity of the mapping means that the net effect of nonlinear evolution is simply to shift the threshold of the corresponding multivariate ( linear theory ) gaussian .",
    "once this shift has been applied , then the previous analysis of the gaussian case goes through in its entirety .",
    "this justifies our use of equation  ( [ p1cum ] ) , and also shows how it might be improved .",
    "equation  ( [ p1pk ] ) in the main text follows from the assumption that peaks are uncorrelated , so the probability that there are no peaks in @xmath147 is given by the poisson expression @xmath148 .",
    "this can be derived from equation  ( [ joint2indep ] ) , by taking the limit of infinite sampling ( in which @xmath149 , so the typical spacing between the cells is no longer of order their size ) .",
    "going beyond the poisson model requires a calculation of the higher order correlation functions ( white 1979 ) .",
    "these are only known approximately ( appendix  f in bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) . on large scales where these are small , the required replacement in equation  ( [ p1pk ] ) is @xmath150 ^ 2 \\frac{\\bar\\xi_{\\rm pk}}{2},\\ ] ] where , for high peaks on large scales , @xmath151 ^ 2 \\bar\\xi_{\\rm pk } \\approx    [ n_{\\rm",

    "<S> we estimate its total mass to be within 20 percent of @xmath7 and we find that even if it is the densest such object of its volume within @xmath8 , its existence is difficult to reconcile with the assumption of gaussian initial conditions if @xmath2 was less than 0.9 . </S>",
