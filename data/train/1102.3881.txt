    "there are very few quantum interacting systems whose ground state properties ( thermodynamic functions , reduced density matrices , etc . ) can be computed without approximations . among these ,",
    "the luttinger and the thirring model @xcite ( one - dimensional spinless relativistic fermions ) , the one - dimensional hubbard model @xcite ( non - relativistic lattice fermions with spin ) , the lieb - liniger model @xcite ( one - dimensional bosons with repulsive delta interactions ) and the bcs model @xcite ( @xmath0-dimensional spinning fermions with mean field interactions , @xmath1 ) ; the construction of the ground states of these systems is based on some remarkable exact solutions , which make use of bosonization techniques and bethe ansatz .",
    "unfortunately , in most cases these exact solutions do not allow to compute the long - distance decay of the @xmath2-particles correlation functions in a closed form ( with some notable exceptions , namely the luttinger and thirring models , see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , even the computation of the thermodynamic functions crucially relies on a very special choice of the particle - particle interaction ; as soon as the interparticle potential is slightly modified the exact solvability of these models is destroyed and no conclusion on the new `` perturbed '' system can be drawn from their solution .",
    "this is , of course , very annoying and unsatisfactory from a physical point of view .",
    "there is another rigorous powerful method that allows in a few cases to fully construct the ground state of a system of interacting particles , known as renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "this method , whenever it works , has the advantage that it provides full information on the zero or low temperatures state of the system , including correlations and that , typically , it is robust under small modifications of the interparticle potential ; even better , it usually gives a very precise meaning to what `` small modifications '' means : it allows one to classify perturbations into `` relevant '' and `` irrelevant '' and to show that the addition of a small irrelevant perturbation does not change the asymptotic behavior of correlations .",
    "unfortunately , it only works in the weak coupling regime and it has only been successfully applied to a limited number of interacting quantum systems .",
    "most of the available results on the ground ( or thermal ) states of interacting quantum systems obtained via rg concern one - dimensional ( 1d ) weakly interacting fermions , e.g. , ultraviolet @xmath3 models with @xmath4 @xcite , ultraviolet qed - like models @xcite and non - relativistic lattice systems @xcite . in more than one dimension ,",
    "most of the result derived by rigorous rg techniques concern the finite temperature properties of two - dimensional ( 2d ) fermionic systems above the bcs critical temperature @xcite .",
    "two remarkable exceptions are the fermi liquid construction by feldman , knrrer and trubowitz @xcite , which concerns zero temperature properties of a system of 2d interacting fermions with highly asymmetric fermi surface , and the ground state construction of the short range half - filled 2d hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice by giuliani and mastropietro @xcite , which will be reviewed here .",
    "the 2d hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice is a basic model for describing _ graphene _ , a newly discovered material consisting of a one - atom thick layer of graphite @xcite , see @xcite for a comprehensive and up - to - date review of its low temperature properties .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of graphene is that at half - filling the fermi surface is highly degenerate and it consists of just two isolated points .",
    "this makes the infrared properties of the system very peculiar : in the absence of interactions , it behaves in the same way as a system of non - interacting @xmath5-dimensional dirac particles @xcite .",
    "therefore , the interacting system is a sort of @xmath5-dimensional qed , with some peculiar differences that make its study new and non - trivial @xcite .    the goal of these lectures is to give a self - contained proof of the analyticity of the ground state energy of the hubbard model on the 2d honeycomb lattice at half filling and weak coupling via constructive rg methods .",
    "a simple extension of the proof of convergence of the series for the specific ground state energy presented below allows one to construct the whole set of reduced density matrices at weak coupling ( see @xcite ) : it turns out that the off - diagonal elements of these matrices decay to zero at infinity , with the same decay exponents as the non - interacting system ; in this sense , the construction presented below rigorously exclude the presence of long range order in the ground state , and the absence of anomalous critical exponents ( in other words , the interacting system is in the same universality class as the non - interacting one ) .",
    "let me also mention that more sophisticated extensions of the methods exposed here also allowed us to : ( i ) give an order by order construction of the ground state correlations of the same model in the presence of electromagnetic interactions @xcite ; ( ii ) predict a possible mechanism for the spontaneous generation of the peierls - kekul instability @xcite ; ( iii ) prove the universality of the optical conductivity @xcite .",

    "the long distance decay of correlations is expected to be described in terms of anomalous critical exponents and the effective fermi velocity is expected to grow up to the maximal possible value , i.e. , the speed of light .",

    "of course , there is some arbitrariness in the definition of @xmath838 : we could change the two sets of operators by multiplying them by two @xmath57-dependent phase factors , @xmath839 , with @xmath840 two arbitrary constant vectors , and get a completely equivalent theory in momentum space .",
    "the freedom in the choice of these phase factors corresponds to the freedom in the choice of the origins of the two sublattices @xmath841 ; this symmetry is sometimes referred to as berry - gauge invariance and it can be thought as a local gauge symmetry in momentum space . note that , by changing the berry phase , the boundary conditions on @xmath838 at the boundaries of the first brillouin zone change ; our explicit choice of the berry phase has the  advantage \" of making @xmath838 periodic over @xmath51 rather than quasi - periodic ."
