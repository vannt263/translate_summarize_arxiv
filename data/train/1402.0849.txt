    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are among the most luminous transient events at optical wavelengths and extremely valuable tools to measure cosmological distances , see @xcite for a recent review . yet",
    ", sne  ia close enough to allow for detailed scrutiny of their physical properties are very rare , especially in a galaxy like m  82 , the host of several recent core - collapse supernovae @xcite . at an estimated distance to m  82 of 3.5 mpc @xcite ,",
    "sn  2014j is the closest identified type ia sn in several decades , possibly rivaled by sn  1972e in ngc  5253 and sn  1986 g in ngc  5128 @xcite .",
    "thus , sn  2014j is exceptionally well - suited for follow - up observations in a wide range of wavelengths , from radio to gamma - rays .",
    "these have the potential to yield transformational new clues into the progenitor systems of sne  ia , as well as the detailed properties of dust along the line of sight , key astrophysical unknowns for the study of the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "there is strong evidence that sne  ia arise from thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( wd ) in binary systems @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the second star remains unclear .",
    "for a long time , the preferred scenario was the single degenerate ( sd ) model @xcite , where a wd accrets mass from a hydrogen or helium rich donor star , thus becoming unstable while approaching the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "the double - degenerate ( dd ) model involving the merger of two wds @xcite has gained considerable observational support in recent years , see e.g. , @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we search for potential signatures of a sd progenitor system , such as variable na  d lines , precursor nova eruptions , features in the early lightcurve , radio emission , or a coincident source in pre - explosion in hst images .",
    "sn  2014j was discovered by @xcite in @xmath1-band images of m  82 obtained on 2014 january 21.81 ut at ucl s university of london observatory .",
    "we have performed image subtractions using pre - explosion data from the palomar p60 telescope as reference , calibrated with nearby stars listed in the apass catalog yielding a discovery magnitude of @xmath2mag . the discovery image ( s.  fossey , private communication ) and the p60 reference image , as well as the difference between the two",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hstnir ] , along with the pre - explosion hst images ( go:11360 , pi : r.  oconell ; go:10776 , pi : m.  mountain ) .",
    "the relative position of sn  2014j with respect to neighboring stars ( middle panel ) was established using multiple short exposures in @xmath3-band with adaptive optics and the nirc2 wide camera at keck @xcite . in section  [ progenitor ]",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the pre - explosion data .",
    "a classification spectrum was obtained by the iptf team on january 22.30 with the dual imaging spectrograph on the arc 3.5 m telescope @xcite , and in the near - ir using the mosfire instrument at keck .",
    "the combined spectra are shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hstnir ] , while the photometry collected so far is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] .",
    "the object shows characteristic spectral features associated with sne  ia , e.g. , similar to sn  2011fe .",
    "however , the steep attenuation of the spectrum at short wavelengths is indicative of unusually large extinction by dust in the line of sight .",
    "a good match to the overall sed is found invoking a pronounced color excess , @xmath4 mag , in addition to galactic reddening , @xmath5 mag @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowres ] . for the comparison",
    ", the spectra of sn  2011fe were artificially reddened assuming a milky - way type extinction law @xcite , where both the color excess and @xmath6 were allowed to vary freely .",
    "the spectrum favors a low value of the total - to - selective extinction , @xmath0 , as also suggested by spectropolarimetry observations by @xcite .",
    "low values of r@xmath7 are not unusual in sne  ia , especially in the cases of high extinction , see e.g.  .",
    "as a part of its continuous survey of the sky in the search for transients , iptf has monitored m  82 since october 2009 , with nearly daily cadence over the several months each year when m  82 is visible from palomar . the most recent campaign started on 2013 , november 28 .",
    "for the periods around full moon ( e.g. , around the time sn  2014j exploded ) , not well suited for transient searches , @xmath8 narrow - band imaging was conducted .",
    "the current best fit of the time of explosion , @xmath9 , was reported by kait @xcite to be january 14.72 ut ( @xmath10 0.2 days ) . upon later scrutiny of the pre - discovery p48 data ,",
    "the supernova was found in several observations from the iptf @xmath8 narrow - band survey , starting just hours after the fitted @xmath9 .",
    "we find a relative flux increase from january 15.18 to january 16.18 of 1.6 mag , consistent with the `` method 2 fit '' in @xcite .",
    "the sn is also prominent on @xmath11-band photometry from the p48 prior to january 21 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] , but remained undetected by our automated software due to pixel saturation .    through an iptf - led effort , involving also the las cumbres observatory global telescope ( lcogt ) network @xcite , the nordic optical telescope and the mount abu observatory @xcite , we have secured optical , near - ir and mid - ir lightcurves carefully monitoring the rise of the supernova , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] .",
    "the @xmath12 m observations were taken under the _ spitzer infrared intensive transients survey _ ( spirits ; pi : kasliwal ) .    the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowres ] are consistent with those from a normal type ia explosion , similar to e.g. , sn 2011fe , but reddened following a ccm - law @xcite with @xmath13 mag and @xmath14 , in addition to galactic reddening .",
    "[ fig : lc ] also shows lightcurve fits using the snoopy fitter @xcite of the photometric data prior to maximum brightness .",
    "best fits are found for @xmath15 mag and @xmath16 .",
    "we expect the accuracy of the fitted parameters to improve , as the lightcurve shape estimate will profit from the decreasing part of the sn lightcurve .",
    "however , the available data clearly puts @xmath6 well below the galactic average value , @xmath17 .",
    "we also obtained two 1800 s high - resolution ( r = 40000 ) spectra with sophie at observatorie haute - provence on january 26.0 and january 28.0 .",
    "further , two 1800 s spectra ( r = 67000 ) were obtained with the fibre - fed echelle spectrograph ( fies ) on january 27.3 and another on february 1.0 with the nordic optical telescope .    all spectra reveal deep multiple component na  i  d absorption and diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) , including @xmath18 5780,5797,6284 , and 6614 , also reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the sophie spectra further contain well resolved ca  ii  h & k with features matching those of the na  i  d lines , shown in the co - added spectrum in fig  [ fig : highres ] .",
    "we have not detected any significant time evolution for any of the resolved components of the na  i  d doublet over the four epochs ( at the @xmath1910% level for @xmath20 ) , thus motivating the combination of the spectra .",
    "following the procedure outlined by @xcite , we measure the equivalent width ( ew ) of the @xmath215780 dib to derive an independent estimate of host galaxy extinction for sn  2014j .",
    "we find ew(5780 ) = 0.48 @xmath22   corresponding to @xmath23 mag . given the low recession velocity of m  82 , it is difficult to separate the contribution from the milky - way and the sn host galaxy absorption .",
    "however , the availability of h  i data from the lab survey in the direction of m  82 ( see inset panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : highres ] ; ) clearly indicates which features are galactic .",
    "hence , all the absorption features redshifted with respect to the milky way are due to intervening material in m  82 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : lowres ] we present a time - series spectral comparison between sn  2011fe and sn  2014j starting roughly 12 days before peak brightness .",
    "the sne are remarkably similar in their spectral evolution .",
    "the main differences seen are that the overall velocities are higher in sn  2014j ( see the inset velocity plot ) and there is a strong signature of high - velocity and in this supernova .    to further investigate these differences we carried out a set of synapps @xcite fits to these two supernovae as well as to sn  2005cf , which was distinct in its pervasive high - velocity features @xcite .",
    "we present the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : synapps ] . in our fits to the red - side of the optical spectra we have employed the ions : c  ii , o  i , mg  ii , si  ii and ca  ii with the latter two having both photospheric and high - velocity components .",
    "we see that sn  2014j more closely resembles sn  2005cf with respect to the high - velocity and features which extend easily over the range of 20,000 - 30,000 kms@xmath24 . unlike either sn",
    "2005cf or sn  2011fe , c  ii and o  i are absent at this phase in sn  2014j .",
    "we searched for the presence of c  i  @xmath21  1.0693  @xmath25 line in our nir spectrum , but the signal - to - noise is too low to do a meaningful fit comparable to that done for sn  2011fe @xcite . we do note that due to the stronger than average mg  ii features seen in the optical for sn  2014j , this analysis may be more challenging , even with higher quality spectra , as the presence of mg  ii  @xmath21  1.0927  @xmath25 should be quite strong as well .",
    "several explanations for the origin of the high - velocity features have been presented , from density enhancements via swept up csm @xcite to mixing or more complete burning in the outer layers of the supernova @xcite to ionization effects in the outer layers @xcite .",
    "what is clear is that the features do offer a unique diagnostic for understanding properties of the progenitor system and/or the explosion mechanism and correlations between the strength of these features and the underlying colors and lightcurves of the sne  ia @xcite .",
    "sn  2014j is among a class of sne ia where high - velocity features are present yet little to no evidence for c  ii exists even in very early spectra ( see the broad line or high - velocity gradient examples in @xcite ) . since extensive uv data from hst exists for both sne 2005cf and 2011fe",
    ", it will be interesting to see which of these supernovae sn  2014j most closely matches with respect to both the color and luminosity evolution .",
    "m  82 has been extensively imaged by hst , thus it is possible to study the environment of the sn prior to the explosion . because of the large attenuation due to dust in the line of sight , we concentrate on the nir bands .",
    "we perform aperture photometry on the nearest sources to sn  2014j , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hstnir ] . the closest object ( yellow circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : hstnir ] ) falls 0.2@xmath26 from the current best estimate of the sn location ( ra = @xmath27 , dec = @xmath28 in j2000 coordinates with respect to the hst image , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , corresponding to a @xmath29 spatial offset . for this source , we measure ab magnitudes of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the error is dominated by the uncertain background subtraction as a result of source confusion .",
    "the @xmath34 color is typical of other sources near this position . at a distance of 3.5 mpc ,",
    "the corresponding absolute magnitude of the nearest resolved object is @xmath35 mag ( @xmath36 mag ) .",
    "this source could represent a stellar cluster , a grouping of unrelated objects or a region of relatively low dust attenuation .",
    "next , we consider the possibility that the source is a donor star in the sd scenario .",
    "the derived luminosity would then suggest a very luminous red supergiant .",
    "however , in the case where a sn originates from a system with csm created by a mass - loss from a donor star , the interaction between the sn ejecta and the csm is expected to give rise to radio emission @xcite .",
    "the radio null - detections on january 23 and 24 @xcite can therefore be used to derive an upper limit on the mass - loss rate . adopting a sn shock - wave velocity of @xmath37 ( about twice the si ii velocity ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : lowres ] ) , and similar parameters as assumed by @xcite for sn2011fe , the upper limit on the mass - loss rate is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the mass - loss wind velocity . the upper limit is comparable to the ones obtained for sn2011fe @xcite . given these tight limits and the spatial displacement , we conclude that the closest resolved source in the pre - explosion hst images is unlikely to be a donor star .",
    "finally , we note that the @xmath40 color map shown in the middle right panel of fig  [ fig : hstnir ] suggests that sn  2014j is at the edge of a dust patch , about 4 pc in projected size .",
    "light echoes may thus be expected for this supernova .",
    "we have searched for possible nova outbursts in the historic p48 @xmath11-band data covering a period of about 1500 days prior to the detection of sn  2014j . by binning the data in bins of 15 days",
    ", we do not find any excess larger than @xmath29 ( calculated using the bootstrap technique , see @xcite ) .",
    "our limiting magnitude is @xmath41mag for a total time span of 1000days , and @xmath42mag for more than 765days in this 1500days time window .",
    "assuming @xmath43 mag , compatible with the extinction we estimate based on the supernova colors , this corresponds to absolute magnitudes @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively at the distance of m  82 .",
    "however , given the uncertainties on the properties of recurrent novae , see e.g.  @xcite , we refrain from drawing firm conclusions against the possibility of recurrent novae preceding sn  2014j based on these non - detections .",
    "the discovery of sn  2014j presents us with a unique opportunity to explore the physics of type ia sne and the line - of - sight effects due to intervening matter .",
    "further understanding in these areas is of utmost importance for the use of sne  ia in cosmology .",
    "the early data from p48 , starting as early as only hours from the explosion , and the multi - wavelength follow - up by the iptf team covers an important range of the available windows in the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "just as the lightcurve reaches its maximum , we have learned that the sn has suffered non - standard extinction .",
    "we have searched for , but not detected , any time variation in our high - resolution spectra of the na  i  d doublet .",
    "similarly , we do not detect any pre - explosion activity in the @xmath191500 days of p48 monitoring . in a study of pre - explosion hst images in the near - ir",
    ", the nearest resolved source is found @xmath46 away from the sn location .",
    "the source brightness and offset from the sn makes it unlikely as a donor star in a single - degenerate scenario .",
    "further , we make a first study of the spectral features of sn  2014j and find that it exhibits high - velocity features from intermediate mass material but lacks c and o often seen in very early spectra . otherwise , it is a very similar to several well - studied normal sne ia .",
