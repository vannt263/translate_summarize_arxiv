    "the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ; @xcite ) showed that our census of cooling , nearby neutron stars was incomplete : it contained not just the known cooling pulsars such as and , but also seven `` isolated neutron stars '' ( inss ) .",
    "these are nearby ( @xmath6 ) , young ( @xmath7 ) , cooling neutron stars with thermal x - ray spectra , long periods ( @xmath8 ) , faint optical counterparts , and no detected radio emission ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "the inss are interesting both because of their abundance and because of the promise of inferring neutron - star parameters from their thermal emission . unfortunately , despite large investments of time with _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _",
    ", the nature of the emission remains puzzling , and we still understand neither the composition nor state ( gaseous , condensed ) of the surface .    a clearer picture has emerged for the origin and abundance of the inss : most likely , they were born with very strong magnetic fields , of @xmath9 , which decayed .",
    "empirical evidence for this comes from our x - ray timing efforts @xcite , which showed that the current field strengths of the inss are remarkably similar , in the range 1.0 to @xmath10 g , and that their characteristic ages of several myr are substantially in excess of true ages of @xmath11myr inferred from cooling and kinematics ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the long periods and characteristic ages",
    "follow naturally if the inss initially had much stronger fields and thus faster spindown , and the similar current field strengths can be understood if fields stop decaying at a common value .",
    "indeed , this was predicted theoretically by @xcite : for initially weak magnetic fields , field decay leads to only a factor @xmath12 change that is essentially unnoticeable @xcite , while for fields above @xmath13 g field decay becomes increasingly important , with predicted final fields that are always a @xmath14 g , independent of the initial values .",
    "the field - decay induced heating may also help explain the observed preponderance of inss compared to `` normal '' middle - aged pulsars @xcite .",
    "if the above is correct , the progenitors of the inss would have been neutron stars with fields ranging from @xmath15 to @xmath16 g .",
    "the most magnetized would correspond to magnetars , but many would not be so energetic . still , as their fields decay on @xmath17kyr timescales , they should be brighter than expected from simple cooling , and there should be a population of relatively long - period , strong - field sources that are anomalously hot . verifying this might not only confirm the hypothesis for the ins population , but also yield clues to their emission : with the higher temperatures and stronger magnetic fields , one might expect the surface to have a different state and the spectra to show different spectral features that could be contrasted to the inss .",
    "checking the @xmath18 diagram for possible ins progenitors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ppdot ] ) , one finds four radio pulsars , one rotating radio transient ( rrat ) , and one relatively low - field anomalous x - ray pulsar ( axp ) ; all have periods longer than 3s and fields in excess of @xmath19 g .",
    "of course , the axp ( ) , like other magnetars , is thought to be powered by magnetic field decay ; it certainly is anomalously hot , with @xmath20kev @xcite . of the others , the rrat and one of the pulsars",
    "have x - ray counterparts as well , with thermal spectra and inferred temperatures of @xmath21ev ( , @xcite ; , @xcite ) .",
    "these temperatures are , as the authors mention , well above expectations from simple cooling ( and also well above the limit of @xmath22ev inferred for @xcite , a young pulsar with a somewhat weaker inferred field ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : ppdot ] ) . the best - studied source , , also has a clear absorption feature at 1kev , well above the energies at which absorption is seen in the inss . among the three remaining sources , and have unpublished , reasonably long _ xmm _ observations .",
    "we checked these and found no counterparts , but as both pulsars are distant and extincted , this is not unexpected . indeed",
    "all of these objects are considerably further than the inss , and while part of this can be explained by their small ages leading to lower space densities , part comes from the narrowly - beamed / intermittent radio emission that is used to detect them ( compared to omni - directional soft x - rays ) .",
    "the last source ,  ( hereafter ) is the subject of this paper .",
    "this 3.44s pulsar was discovered in the course of the parkes high - latitude survey @xcite but surprisingly has not seen any x - ray follow - up , despite its inferred magnetic field of @xmath23 g and characteristic age of only @xmath24kyr . yet",
    ", it is arguably the most interesting , since it should be the least extincted  both because it has the lowest dispersion measure ( dm ) of all ( 70 vs.  200 to @xmath25 for the other four pulsars ) and because it is at what is , for a young pulsar , high galactic latitude ( @xmath26 vs.@xmath27 for the others ) .",
    "furthermore , it may well be the closest . from its dispersion measure , combined with a model of the galactic electron distribution @xcite , one infers a rough distance of  3kpc .",
    "but at that distance , its height above the galactic plane is 250pc , which is somewhat improbable .",
    "a more likely alternative is that it is at @xmath28kpc , situated ( and born ) in the @xcite , which this line of sight passes through ( and which may influence the dispersion measure ) .",
    "below , we will scale our distances to @xmath29 .",
    "overall ,  seems a prime candidate for comparison with the inss , being relatively close and unabsorbed , and apparently intermediate between the stronger - field pulsars that look most like ins progenitors and the weak - field normal pulsars that form the bulk of the population .",
    "intriguingly , we found a possible counterpart to  in the rass : , with @xmath30 .",
    "the nominal separation of @xmath31 from the pulsar is relatively large , but in the rass image , the source seemed somewhat extended , encompassing the pulsar .",
    "here , we present a _ chandra x - ray observatory _ of that confirms the identification with , and allows a first comparison between  and the inss , opening the way for detailed followup .",
    "we observed  with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; @xcite ) aboard the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( _ cxo _ ; @xcite ) on 2011",
    "june 15 for 17.9ks ( ) . for best sensitivity at low energies , we used the back - illuminated s3 ccd , selecting the 1/8-subarray read - out mode ( with 0.4s sampling ) to resolve the 3-s pulse period .",
    "we processed the level-1 event lists following standard procedures ( using ` chandra_repro ` from ciao v4.3 and caldb v4.4.5 ) .",
    "the data show one clear source , with a j2000 position ( from ` celldetect ` ) @xmath32 , @xmath33 with an uncertainty dominated by the boresight error of @xmath34 ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "this is consistent with the radio position of  in the atnf pulsar catalog @xcite ) : @xmath35 , @xmath36 .    for our further analysis",
    ", we selected 1179 source events from a circular region with a radius of 5 pixels ( @xmath37 ) , encompassing @xmath38 of the source photons , and 326 background events from the rest of the detector area ( a factor of 1200 larger in area ) , with energies between 220ev ( the recommended lower - bound for data from the acis ; any lower and the calibration becomes unreliable and soft flares become increasingly dominant ) and 1.1kev ( where the effects of higher - energy flares are minimized ; the source is barely detected above 1.1kev ) .",
    "we corrected the event times to the solar system barycenter using ` axbary ` , assuming the radio position .",
    "to look for x - ray pulsations , we first determined the frequency that maximized the power in a @xmath39 periodogram ( rayleigh statistic ; @xcite ) at different multiples of the radio frequency .",
    "we found no obvious peak at the expected frequency of the pulsar ( @xmath40 ) , but a strong one ( @xmath41 ) at roughly double the frequency , @xmath42hz ( where the uncertainty was calculated following @xcite ) .",
    "we found no evidence for significant power in higher harmonics ( @xmath43 and 0.70 at the third and fourth harmonic , respectively ) .",
    "we folded our data on half our best - fit frequency to construct a binned light - curve ( with 16 phase bins ; figure  [ fig : pulse ] ) .",
    "as expected from the lack of other harmonics , a sinusoid provided a good fit ( @xmath44 for 13 degrees of freedom [ dof ] ) , with a pulsed fraction ( semi - amplitude ) of @xmath45 .",
    "the implied toa , defined as the maximum of the sinusoid closest to the middle of the observation , is mjd @xmath46 .",
    "the ephemeris in the atnf catalog ( based on data from 20052006 ) predicts a frequency of @xmath47hz at the epoch of our observation , which differs by @xmath48 from our measurement .",
    "further radio observations would help determine whether this is due to chance or due to something intrinsic ( a glitch or timing noise ) .    in order to compare the phase of the radio and x - ray pulses",
    ", we retrieved an archived parkes observation of  from 2005  march  26 . the pulse profile , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] , was substantially noisier than that shown in @xcite , but still sufficed to determine a toa . from the highest point in the profile ,",
    "we find mjd @xmath49 , with the uncertainty being @xmath50 phase bins . with this toa and the atnf ephemeris",
    ", we infer a phase difference of @xmath51cycles , where the uncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the ephemeris ( see figure  [ fig : pulse ] ) .",
    "spectral fitting was done in ` sherpa ` @xcite . for the fits",
    ", we only included events between 0.321.1kev , as the response below 320ev is not well understood .",
    "this leaves 1003 source and 267 background counts .",
    "we follow recommendations in modeling the low - energy background with a power - law instead of subtracting it ( although given that the expected background in the source area is less than 1 count , it does not influence the results ) .",
    "we binned the source counts such that each bin contained at least 25 counts and was at least 29ev wide , so that @xmath52 statistics are a good approximation , and we do not oversample the instrumental resolution of @xmath53ev .",
    "we tried three main source models : a thermal blackbody , a non - thermal power law , and a simple neutron - star atmosphere model ( nsa ; @xcite ) , all modified by interstellar absorption ( using ` xsphabs ` ; the parameters changed only minutely with other choices , such as ` xstbabs ` and ` xswabs ` ) .",
    "we tried nsa models with and without a strong magnetic field ; for both , we fixed the mass and radius of the neutron star at @xmath54 and 10 km , respectively .",
    "our results are summarized in table  [ tab : specfit ] ( there and below , temperatures and radii refer to those measured by a distant observer ) .",
    "the nsa models gave reasonable fits , but implied implausibly small distances : @xmath55 and @xmath56pc for the @xmath57 and @xmath58 g models , respectively .",
    "a power - law model gave a significantly worse fit than the thermal models ( @xmath59 vs.45.1 for 67 dof ) .",
    "we found that , similar to the inss , a simple blackbody gave a good fit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) and the most reasonable parameters . , the expected count rate for rosat pspc is @xmath60 ( estimated using the portable , interactive multi - mission simulator [ pimms ] ; http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/tools/w3pimms.html ) .",
    "thus , most likely  is responsible for all of the flux of . ] in what follows , we use that as our baseline model .",
    "we find there is significant covariance between the fitted parameters , which , within @xmath61 , leads to changes in absorption of @xmath62 and in temperature of @xmath15ev . to explore the influence of the absorption column",
    ", we also tried fits where we held @xmath63 fixed at 1 or 10 times the dispersion measure ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "these fits were somewhat worse than those with @xmath63 free , but still had reduced @xmath52 less than 1 .    to constrain any additional non - thermal emission , we tried adding a power law to the blackbody .",
    "we found it had negligible effect on the parameters , and , assuming @xmath65 , we infer a @xmath61 upper limit of the photon rate of @xmath66 at 1kev , corresponding to @xmath67 of the flux in the 0.321.1kev band .",
    "we also tried fitting the spectrum of  with a model that included an additive gaussian line , in order to constrain the presence of absorption features similar to those seen for the inss , which have equivalent widths of up to several 100ev @xcite .",
    "we fixed the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the line to 0.1kev , comparable to the energy resolution of the back - illuminated acis - s3 ccd , and varied the line energy between 0.3kev and 1.1kev , fitting only for its amplitude ( allowing both positive and negative amplitudes ) . as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] , we did not find evidence for any absorption line .",
    "the largest improvement in the fit occurs near 0.6kev , for an emission line with a height of @xmath68% , but even this reduces @xmath52 by only 4 , which is not significant given our number of trials ( based on simulations , we estimate a false - alarm probability of @xmath69 ) .",
    "we infer a 68%-confidence upper limit of 50ev to the equivalent width of any feature .",
    "finally , we looked for phase - resolved trends in two ways .",
    "first , we determined the median energy as a function of pulse phase ( upper panel in figure  [ fig : pulse ] ) , finding little change except perhaps a hint of hardening at the maximum that is coincident with the radio peak , although given the current statistics this is not significant ( the @xmath52 for the median energy is 9 for 15 degrees - of - freedom ) .",
    "second , we separated the data into two bins : one containing the two maxima and one the two minima , each with 50% of the exposure time . from our fit ( table  [ tab : specfit ] and figure  [ fig : spec ] ) , we find negligible difference in temperature between the maxima and minima , consistent with the lack of change seen in median energy .",
    "thus , the pulsations appear to reflect mostly changes in emitting area .      to check for possible extended emission , e.g. , from a pulsar wind nebula , we compared our observations with a simulated point - spread function ( psf ) , created using ` chart ` ( the _ chandra _ ray tracer ) and ` marx ` ( version 4.5.0 ) , for a spectrum consistent with our best - fit blackbody .",
    "we find good agreement for radii @xmath70pixels ( @xmath71 ) , although with only @xmath72 counts at these radii , the constraints are not strong .",
    "oddly , the two bins at the smallest radii , 00.5pixels and 0.51.0pixels , had some deviations , with the model psf underpredicting the counts in the first bin by about 6@xmath73 ( 30% ) , and overpredicting the second by about 4@xmath73 ( 26% ) .",
    "since it is unlikely that the pulsar is more centrally concentrated than a point - source , we probably are simply reaching the limits in the model ( we experimented with the _ chandra _  processing , turning off pixel position randomization , but found that this made little difference ) .",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence for extended emission on scales of @xmath74 .",
    "regardless of the path by which  and the inss got to their present states , we can examine how closely their current properties resemble each other and whether the unique information from either helps understand the thermal emission from this class of neutron stars as a whole .",
    "furthermore , we can see how  might help us understand the evolution of high-@xmath75 pulsars and the origin of the inss .",
    "we consider these in turn .",
    "was selected to be similar to the inss in having a long spin - period , @xmath76s , and strong magnetic field , @xmath77 g . with a thermal spectrum with @xmath78 , and @xmath79 ( at the nominal distance of @xmath28kpc in the ) ,",
    "its x - ray properties are similar as well ( indeed , it would be classified as an ins based on these ) .",
    "its spectrum has no evidence for absorption , unlike , which has strong absorption @xcite while having a very similar magnetic field and a slightly higher temperature ( @xmath80 g , @xcite ; @xmath81ev , @xcite ) .",
    "however , , another ins with a similar if slightly lower field ( @xmath82 g , @xcite ) , had weak absorption , with an equivalent width of @xmath83 , which we would not be able to detect , when its temperature was most similar to  ( @xmath84 , @xcite ) .",
    "intriguingly , this source changed , developing much stronger absorption while becoming hotter ( @xmath85 , @xcite ) .",
    "taking our inferred temperature at face value , it is thus possible that emits identically to an ins of the same temperature and dipole magnetic field strength .",
    "if so , at higher sensitivity it may show weak absorption at @xmath86 .",
    "( we caution , however , that the dependencies of absorption energy and strength on temperature and magnetic field strength remain puzzling for the inss as a class ; @xcite . )",

    "this is on the low side of what is seen for the inss ( @xmath138 ) , possibly just a consequence of  having a shorter period for the same @xmath75 ( for dipole spin - down , @xmath139 ) .",
    "it is much larger than the non - thermal emission typically observed for rotation - powered pulsars ( @xmath140 , @xcite ) , although we can not exclude that  has a similar non - thermal component : our 1@xmath73 upper limit of 3% of the 0.321.1kev flux for the contribution of a power - law with @xmath65 ( a value typical for pulsars ) implies @xmath141 .",
    "the pulse properties of  also echo those of the inss , which show smooth profiles dominated by the fundamental or the first harmonic .",
    "the pulse fraction of @xmath142% is a little larger than the @xmath143 to 18% seen for the inss @xcite , but it is not dramatically different .",
    "we note that without the radio period , we might have actually identified the pulse period of  as half of the true value .",
    "the lack of temperature variation is somewhat strange ( cf .",
    "up to 10% changes in @xmath144 over the pulse of , for example ; @xcite ) , as , naively , it implies that we are seeing changes in projected area of large regions of similar temperature with anything in between so much colder that it does not contribute",
    ". it may be that instead the whole surface emits at more or less a uniform temperature , and that the pulsations reflect anisotropies in the emission , perhaps associated with the strong magnetic field .",
    "the same may hold for the inss , which typically also show only modest changes in temperature with pulse phase .",
    "a possible difference with the inss is that  has an order - of - magnitude smaller characteristic age .",
    "this may again be a consequence of its shorter period for the same @xmath75 ( for dipole spin - down , @xmath145 ) , but might also point to an evolutionary difference ( see below ) .",
    "another characteristic of inss is that they have faint optical counterparts , but with optical / uv fluxes a factor of 650 above the extrapolation of the x - rays .",
    "this is in contrast to middle - aged pulsars such as and , which have ultraviolet fluxes that are more consistent with the x - ray extrapolations @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether  has an excess or not .    of course , the most glaring difference between  and the inss is the radio emission .",
    "numerous searches have yet to find confirmed radio emission ( coherent or bursty ) from the inss ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this may be a result of their location near the pulsar `` death line , '' or more simply a consequence of their narrow radio beams : the 50% width of the radio pulse from  is @xmath146 of the pulse period ( consistent with general trends for long - period pulsars ) so the chance of missing the radio pulse is large .",
    "overall , we conclude that with the exceptions of its radio emission and characteristic age , the properties of  agree with those of the inss . based on the compilations of @xcite , @xcite , and references therein",
    ", it is the best pulsar analog to the inss to date .      in order to look for evolutionary trends , we can compare  to sources with similar properties in the @xmath147-@xmath148 diagram , as well as with the evolution expected from the work of @xcite , which seems to explain the origins of the inss ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ppdot ] ) .",
    "a first comparison is with inss of similar field and temperature , and .",
    "as mentioned , the main difference is that the characteristic age of  is @xmath149kyr , while those of the inss are @xmath150myr .",
    "this could imply that the true age of  is closer to its characteristic age than is the case for the inss , and maybe that it has undergone less @xmath75 decay .",
    "this is consistent with the models of @xcite : @xmath1 g is near the dividing line where field - decay becomes important , and the true age is expected to be no more than a factor  2 shorter than the characteristic age ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ppdot ] ) . taking the models at face value ,",
    "one infers that  was born with a dipole field of just below @xmath151 g , while most inss would have had a field about a factor  2 stronger .    as a second comparison",
    ", we can compare  with two x - ray - detected objects that have almost the same period : the modest-@xmath75 ins ( @xmath152 g , @xcite ) , and the high-@xmath75 pulsar  ( @xmath153 g , @xcite ) .",
    "the former is very similar to , with the main difference being that it is cooler ( @xmath154ev ) . from the evolutionary tracks",
    ", it seems most likely  initially simply had even lower magnetic field strength , which decayed by a factor @xmath12 or so , and that , like , its true age is at most a factor 2 shorter than its characteristic age of 2myr .    from the evolutionary tracks ,  would be a good candidate progenitor for inss like , and indeed it has a largely thermal spectrum consistent with a blackbody with a significantly hotter temperature ( @xmath155ev ) , suggestive of on - going field decay .",
    "however , the emitting radius of @xmath156 km and pulsed fraction of @xmath157% differ from those found for the inss ( and ) , and are more reminiscent of even younger high-@xmath75 pulsars like @xcite , which also have high pulsed fractions and smaller radii ( although distance and fitting uncertainties make the radii for all these objects poorly constrained )",
    ". it may be that this reflects some combination of ongoing @xmath75 decay and non - thermal heating ; all these younger , strong - field objects have substantially larger spin - down energy losses .",
    "alternatively , the stronger field may lead to more anisotropic emission .",
    "overall , it seems that the inss and high-@xmath75 pulsars form a single family ( also see @xcite for further discussion ) , with initial fields that were stronger than their current ones , and that caused rapid initial spin - down .",
    "the long periods for the slower spinning objects also imply low rotational energy losses and thus weak non - thermal emission . combined with some additional heating due to field decay ,",
    "this makes the thermal emission stand out more than it would in normal pulsars .",
    "a continuing puzzle , however , is the difference with the magnetars @xcite , which occupy similar parts of the @xmath147-@xmath148 diagram , but are clearly much more strongly affected by magnetic field decay . it may be that those were born with much stronger toroidal components to the field ( which affect the spin - down only indirectly , via the more rapid field decay ) .",
    "in any case , there may be a smooth continuum , given objects like ( @xmath158 g ) which exhibited a sudden , magnetar - like x - ray outburst @xcite , the ins  that exhibited a possible magnetic reconfiguration @xcite , the transient magnetar that was detected in outburst @xcite but in quiescence appears more like an ins @xcite , or the putative low-@xmath75 magnetar ( @xmath159 g ; @xcite ) .",
    "our _ chandra _  observations show that the relatively nearby high-@xmath75 pulsar  has properties similar to those of the inss , showing analogous thermal emission and similar smooth pulsations . because of its radio emission ,  may help us clarify the nature of the emission and the pulsations .",
    "first , for many radio pulsars the observed polarization position angle curve is well described by the rotating vector model @xcite , in which the position angle is assumed to be aligned with a dipolar magnetic field . using this model",
    ", one can infer the ( mis)alignment between the spin and magnetic axes , as well as the angle between the spin axis and line - of - sight .",
    "using such a model for  and combining it with fits to the x - ray light - curve will help resolve the ambiguities that limited lightcurve analyses for inss @xcite .",
    "second , unlike for the inss where only x - ray and optical astrometry ( both of limited precision ) are possible , for  traditional radio techniques are available ( proper motions with the very large array , and potentially parallaxes with the very long baseline array ) .",
    "this means that even though the likely distance is @xmath28kpc , which would be well outside of reach for an optical parallax , we can hope for a geometric distance measurement for that would constrain its emitting radius .",
