    "although both observations and theoretical simulations support the hypothesis that the fragmentation of collapsing protostellar cores is the main mechanism for the formation of binary / multiple stellar systems , many key questions concerning this fragmentation process , e.g. , the exact _ when _ , _ where _ , _ why _ , and _ how _ , are still under debate ( see reviews by bodenheimer et al . 2000 , tohline 2002 , and goodwin et al .",

    "nevertheless , we want to note that source a resembles a class0 protostar in at least two aspects : ( 1 ) it is associated with a cm radio source ( vla4 ; rodrguez et al . 1999 ) and embedded in a large - scale dusty envelope , and ( 2 ) it is driving an extremely high velocity co outflow ( b2000 ) , which is believed to be one of the characteristics of class0 protostars ( see bachiller 1996 ) . we speculate that source a could be a class0/i transition object , which is visible at infrared wavelengths due to the high inclination angle ( see b2000 ) .",
    "assuming that the kinetic gas temperature is equal to the dust temperature ( @xmath420k ; see table  5 ) , the thermal line widths of n@xmath0h@xmath1 and an  average \" particle of mass 2.33m@xmath35 ( assuming gas with 90% h@xmath19 and 10% he ) are @xmath40.18kms@xmath5 and @xmath40.62kms@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the latter line width represents the local sound speed . the non - thermal contribution to the n@xmath0h@xmath1 line width ( @xmath36 )",
    "is then estimated to be @xmath40.44kms@xmath5 , which is about two times larger than the thermal line width , but smaller than the local sound speed ( i.e. , subsonic ) .",
    "it is widely accepted that turbulence is the main contribution to the non - thermal line width ( goodman et al .",
    "1998 ) , while infall , outflow , and rotation could also broaden the line width in protostellar cores .",
    "the spatial distribution of the line widths in svs13 ( see fig.5 ) shows that large line widths ( @xmath310.45kms@xmath5 ) only occur in the gap between sources b and vla3 and the jet - like extension at the edge of the core . at or around the two sources , line widths",
    "are relatively small ( 0.3@xmath20.4kms@xmath5 ) . excluding the gap and extension",
    ", the re - estimated non - thermal line width would be @xmath40.35kms@xmath5 .",
    "although this is still larger than the thermal line width , it is fair to say that the turbulence in the svs13 core is at a low level .",
    "the velocity field map ( fig.4 ) shows a clear velocity gradient across the core of @xmath4 28kms@xmath5pc@xmath5 increasing from southwest to northeast , i.e. , roughly along the connection line between sources b and vla3 .",
    "as discussed in paperi , systematic velocity gradients are usually dominated by either rotation or outflow .",
    "as seen in fig.4 , the large angle ( @xmath1470@xmath37 ) between the gradient and the outflow axis suggests that the observed velocity gradient in n@xmath0h@xmath1 is due to core rotation rather than outflow .",
    "the velocity gradient derived in svs13 is much larger than the results found in papersi&ii ( @xmath47kms@xmath5pc@xmath5 ) and other class0 objects , e.g. , iram04191 ( @xmath417kms@xmath5pc@xmath5 ; belloche & andr 2004 ) , suggesting fast rotation of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 core .",
    "with this gradient and the fwhm core size ( @xmath41520au ) , the specific angular momentum @xmath38 is calculated to be @xmath40.47@xmath1010@xmath39kms@xmath5pc ( @xmath41.45@xmath1010@xmath40m@xmath30s@xmath5 ) , using the same method as described in paperii .",
    "the ratio of the rotational energy to the gravitational potential energy is also calculated with the same method as described in paperii , and the estimated @xmath41 value is @xmath40.025 ( uncorrected for inclination angle ) .",
    "our observations show a weak 3 mm dust continuum source at the position of the radio source vla3 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this dust continuum source is embedded in the elongated n@xmath0h@xmath1 core together with source b ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the angular separation and flux ratio between sources b and vla3 are measured to be 107@xmath1202 and @xmath413 from the 3 mm dust continuum image , respectively .",
    "the velocity field map shows a clear velocity gradient across the two sources , with sources vla3 and b being located in the red- and blue - shifted regions , respectively . as discussed above , we assume that this systematic velocity gradient is due to the core rotation . the two sources are thus probably forming a protobinary system that has originated from rotational fragmentation of the core that we now observe in the n@xmath0h@xmath1 line .",
    "fig.9 shows a position - velocity diagram , along the connecting - line between sources b and vla3 .",
    "the radial velocity difference between the two sources is @xmath40.5kms@xmath5 . assuming that the two sources are in keplerian rotation and that the orbit is circular and perpendicular to the plane to the sky , the velocity difference yields a combined binary mass of @xmath41.1@xmath3 . assuming a mass ratio of @xmath413 ( @xmath42/@xmath43 ) , the derived masses of sources b and vla3 are 1.0 and 0.08@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the estimated dynamical mass of source b is consistent with the total gas mass derived from the 1.4 mm dust continuum image ( 1.05@xmath3 ) .",
    "this in turn supports our assumption above that both sources b and vla3 are forming a bound binary system .",
    "hereafter we refer to this binary protostar as the svs13b / vla3 protobinary system .",
    "we also note that source a , which is much closer to vla3 in the 3 mm dust continuum image , is probably further away in foreground or background .",
    "this shows that 2-d images can be very misleading unless additional kinematic information like that derived from our n@xmath19h@xmath20 observations is also considered .",
    "the 3 mm dust continuum image shows three distinct cores ( a , b , and c ) in svs13 , which are roughly aligned along a line in the northeast - southwest direction ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the morphology of the n@xmath19h@xmath20 emission approximately follows this alignment .",
    "nevertheless , there is an emission gap ( hole ) between the n@xmath19h@xmath20 main core and the small clumps towards northeast of source a ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "this gap is possibly caused by an effect of the outflow , which releases great amounts of co molecules and thus destroys n@xmath19h@xmath20 around source a ( see aikawa et al .",
    "2001 and also discussion in paper ii ) .",
    "the projected separations between sources a - b and b - c are @xmath45000au and @xmath47000au , respectively .",
    "previous single - dish submm and mm maps show a large - scale common envelope with a radius of @xmath420000au ( 0.1pc ) , surrounding these three cores and elongated in the same direction ( chini et al . 1997 ; chandler & richer 2000 ) . based on these associated morphologies ,",
    "we speculate that the three cores ( a , b , and c ) were formed by initial fragmentation of a large - scale filamentary prestellar core .    on the other hand , in the svs13b sub - core , a binary protostar with a projected separation of 3800au is forming .",
    "the velocity field associated with this binary protostar is dominated by rotation and the ratio of rotational energy to gravitational energy is estimated to be @xmath41 @xmath40.025 .",
    "the @xmath41 value is believed to play an important role in the fragmentation process ( see reviews by bodenheimer et al . 2000 and tohline 2002 ) .",
    "considering that magnetic fields support fragmentation , boss ( 1999 ) has shown that rotating cloud cores fragment when @xmath41 @xmath14 0.01 initially ( but see also machida et al .",
    "based on this velocity structure , we suggest that the binary protostar in svs13 b is formed through rotational fragmentation of a single collapsing protostellar core .    altogether we suggest a hierarchical fragmentation picture for svs13 .",
    "( 1 ) a large - scale filamentary prestellar core was initially fragmented into three sub - cores ( sources a , b , and c ) due to turbulence ( see the review by goodwin et al .",
    "( 2 ) these sub - cores are continually contracting toward higher degrees of central condensation , and the rotation of the sub - cores is getting faster and dominates the gas motion instead of turbulence .",
    "( 3 ) at a certain point , the condensations inside these sub - cores become gravitationally unstable and start to collapse separately to form either a binary protostar ( e.g. , svs13a and b ) if the rotational energy is larger than a certain level ( e.g. , @xmath41 @xmath14 0.01 ) or a single protostar ( e.g. , svs13c ? ) if the rotational energy is not high enough to trigger the fragmentation .",
    "accretion onto a protobinary is one of the most important contributions to the final parameters of the system .",
    "numerical simulations of accretion have found that the main dependencies are on the binary mass ratio and the relative specific angular momentum , @xmath44 , of the infalling material ( see bate & bonnell 1997 and bate 2000 ) .",
    "for unequal mass components , low @xmath44 material is accreted by the primary or its disk ; for higher @xmath44 , the infalling material can also be accreted by the secondary or its disk ; when @xmath44 approaches the specific angular momentum of the binary system @xmath45 , circumbinary disk formation begins ; when @xmath44 @xmath46 @xmath45 , the infalling material is accreted by neither component but only forms a circumbinary disk .    in our observations conducted at ovro , atca and pdbi",
    ", we find in several protobinary systems that only one component is associated with a great amounts of circumstellar dust while the other is somewhat naked , e.g. , svs13b / vla3 ( this work ) , cb230 ( launhardt 2001 ; launhardt et al . in prep . ) , and bhr71 ( paperii ) .",
    "a similar situation was also found in the svs13a protobinary system ( anglada et al .",
    "in fact , there is a trend derived from observations of only a very small number of sources ( i.e. , not a statistically significant sample ) that unequal circumstellar masses ( mass ratios below 0.5 ) protobinary systems are much more common than those equal masses systems ( launhardt 2004 ; chen et al . in prep . ) .",
    "since the detection bias goes towards equal - mass protobinary systems ( e.g. , sources vla1623 , lmw2000 and l723 vla2 , launhardt 2004 ) , we consider this trend is not negligible .",
    "the large contrast between the two components implies that the accretion and hence development of a circumstellar disk occurs preferentially in only one component , with the disk absent or much less significant in the other one .",
    "according to the definition in bate & bonnell ( 1997 , hereafter bb97 ) , we can calculate the specific orbital angular momenta of binary system as @xmath45 = @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 , @xmath42 , and @xmath49 are the gravitational constant , total binary mass , and separation , respectively ) , and consider it as an unity . taking svs13 b as an example , we assume @xmath42 = 1.0@xmath3 ( see @xmath224.3 ) and @xmath49 = 3800au , and adopt the specifical angular momentum derived from the n@xmath0h@xmath1 velocity field as @xmath44 ( @xmath4 1.5@xmath1010@xmath40m@xmath30s@xmath5 ) .",
    "we then derive @xmath44/@xmath45 @xmath40.1 .",
    "this ratio is exactly corresponding to the simulated case that only circumprimary disk could be formed in an accreting protobinary system ( see bb97 ) .",
    "therefore , the fact that only one component in a protobinary system is associated with a large amount of circumstellar material ( or a circumstellar disk ) could be explained by the relatively low specific angular momentum in the infalling envelope .    for a comparison , we list in table  6 the corresponding parameters of l1551 irs5 , a well - studied protobinary system which we already knew the information of infalling gas and binary parameters ( e.g. , dynamical mass and separation ) .",
    "in contrast to svs13b , l1551 irs5 apparently corresponds to a case of accretion of material with relatively higher angular momentum ( @xmath44/@xmath45@xmath41.0 ) , and both components in the system are observed with a circumstellar disk ( see rodrguez et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is also consistent with the theoretical simulation in bb97 .",
    "nevertheless , so far the data which would reveal the link between specific angular momenta and formation of circumstellar disks are very rare , and no statistically significant correlations can be derived yet .",
    "we present iram - pdbi observations in the n@xmath0h@xmath1(1@xmath20 ) line and the 1.4 and 3 mm dust continuum toward the low - mass protostellar core svs13 .",
    "complementary infrared data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ are also used in this work .",
    "the main results are summarized below :    \\(1 ) the 3 mm dust continuum image resolves four sources in svs13 , named a , b , c , and vla3 , respectively .",
    "source c lies outside of the view at 1.4 mm , while source vla3 is not seen in the 1.4 mm continuum image .",
    "the separations between sources a - b and b - c are measured to be @xmath45000au and @xmath47000au , respectively .",
    "assuming optically thin dust emission , we derive total gas masses of @xmath40.2@xmath21.1@xmath3 for the sources .",
    "\\(2 ) n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) emission is detected in svs13 .",
    "the emission is spatially associated with the dust continuum sources b and vla3 .",
    "the excitation temperature of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 line is @xmath411k .",
    "the fwhm radius of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 core is @xmath41520au .",
    "the line widths are roughly constant within the interiors of the core and large line widths only occur in the gap between the two dust continuum sources and a jet - like extension at the edge of the core .",
    "the observed mean line width is @xmath40.48kms@xmath5 and the derived virial mass of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 core is @xmath40.7@xmath3 .",
    "\\(3 ) we derive the n@xmath0h@xmath1 radial velocity field for svs13 .",
    "the velocity field shows a systematic velocity gradient of @xmath428kms@xmath5pc@xmath5 across the dust continuum sources b and vla3 , which could be explained by rotation .",
    "we estimate the specific angular momentum of @xmath40.47@xmath1010@xmath39kms@xmath5pc ( @xmath41.45@xmath1010@xmath40m@xmath50s@xmath5 ) for this n@xmath0h@xmath1 core .",
    "the ratio of rotational energy to gravitational energy is @xmath40.025 .",
    "\\(4 ) infrared emission from sources a and c is detected at @xmath6 irac bands and mips bands .",
    "source a is driving a chain of hh objects , as seen in the irac 4.5@xmath28 m infrared image .",
    "no infrared emission is detected from source b in any @xmath6 bands , suggesting the source is deeply embedded .",
    "\\(5 ) by fitting the spectral energy distributions , we derive the dust temperature , bolometric temperature , and bolometric luminosity for the sources a , b , and c. we find that sources b and c are class0 protostars , while source a could be a class0/i transition object .",
    "\\(6 ) the velocity field associated with sources b and vla3 suggests that the two sources are forming a physically bound protobinary system embedded in a common n@xmath0h@xmath1 core .",
    "the estimated dynamical mass of source b ( @xmath41.0@xmath3 ) is consistent with its gas mass derived from the mm dust continuum images .",
    "\\(7 ) based on the morphologies and velocity structures , we suggest a hierarchical fragmentation picture for svs13 : the three sources ( a , b , and c ) in svs13 were formed by initial fragmentation of a filamentary prestellar core , while the protobinary systems svs13b / vla3 and svs13a were formed by rotational fragmentation of the collapsing sub - cores .",
    "\\(8 ) our observations conducted at ovro , atca , and pdbi find in several protobinary systems that only one component is associated with a large amount of circumstellar material while the other is somewhat naked , implying that the accretion and hence development of a circumstellar disk occurs preferentially in only one component , with the disk absent or much less significant in the other one .",
    "we find that this situation could be explained by the relatively low specific angular momentum in the infalling envelope , which is supported by both simulations and observations .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for many insightful comments and suggestions .",
    "we want to thank the iram staff for help provided during the observations and data reduction .",
    "x. chen thanks the research funding from the european community s sixth framework programme for data reduction travel at the iram / grenoble .",
