    "the recovered entropy is only about 80% the ground - state doublet ( r@xmath93 ) .",
    "we note , however , that there is a broad feature centered around 8  k , which is consistent with a schottky anomaly generated by the cef splitting of 19  k. this result indicates that the first excited cef state is already partially occupied at t@xmath92 , giving an additional entropy to the expected r@xmath93 .",
    "therefore , the reduction of entropy is larger than 20% , although a precise calculation can not be evaluated .",
    "it is unlikely that a reduction of entropy of more than 20% can be fully accounted for by classical magnetic fluctuations .",
    "for example , numerical calculations of the ising model on a simple cubic lattice find an entropy reduction of just under 20% at t@xmath92 , with other three dimensional geometries showing an even smaller reduction.@xcite we thus attribute this reduction to both magnetic frustration and hybridization between ce @xmath94-electrons and conduction electrons .",
    "this conclusion is motivated by the enhanced effect masses found in dhva experiments@xcite and the magnetic frustration that often arises from competing exchange interactions .    due to the similar energy scales of the first excited cef state ( @xmath95  k ) and the peak in resistance ( @xmath96  k ) , we performed high - temperature resistance measurements in several different fields .",
    "the results are presented in inset of fig .",
    "if the peak near 24  k were due to crystal field depopulation , then increasing the field should lead to an increase of the energy difference between the lowest zeeman split state of the ground state and the upper zeeman split state of the first excited cef state .",
    "this in turn would lead to an increase of the temperature of the resistance peak as the field is increased , which is in fact observed experimentally .",
    "we note that , in heavy fermion compounds where the energy difference between kondo coherence and @xmath97 is small , the onset of kondo coherence ( @xmath98 ) usually occurs at temperatures of the order of @xmath99 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath100  k in ceagbi@xmath15 .",
    "however , the experimental lack of two distinct resistance maxima as is typically observed when the energy difference is large@xcite leads to an ambiguity as to whether the resistance peak is due to cef splitting of kondo coherence .",

    "the magnetization saturates just below @xmath106 @xmath107/ce , which is slightly lower than the saturation value of @xmath108 @xmath107/ce previously reported , and may be due to a non - linearity between the deflection of the cantilever and the corresponding change in capacitance .",

    "is observed and the transition eventually becomes step - like .",
    "field sweeps performed around this transition show signs of irreversibility , namely a @xmath114  koe wide hysteresis loop , providing further evidence of first - order behavior .",
    "this in contrast with other ce - based bismuthides .",
    "for instance , other members of the isovalent series such as cecubi@xmath1 ( @xmath115  k ) and ceaubi@xmath1 ( @xmath116  k ) show only a single clear spin - flop transition .",
    "we note , however , that multiple steps have been observed in previous reports on more deficient cecubi@xmath1 ( @xmath117  k ) and even cecubi@xmath1 ( @xmath115  k ) shows hints to a second transition just before the main one .",
    "it is also noteworthy that hysteresis loops show a significant difference ( @xmath118 koe ) at the transition centered near @xmath119  koe as well .",
    "the change in magnetization , however , is not nearly as abrupt as found in the 78  koe transition .",
    "it is well - known that transport measurements in real materials are complicated by disorder .",
    "thus , as this transition is clearly not strongly first - order , the slight amount of irreversibility is likely attributed to pinning due to crystallographic defects ( e.g. , inherent silver deficiency ) .",
    "in fact , a small amount of hysteresis ( on the order of a hundred gauss ) was also observed in magnetization and transport at the remaining three transitions .",
    "the rich phase structure in ceagbi@xmath1 is likely due to the weak anisotropy combined with anisotropic exchange parameters with opposite signs , which lead to magnetic frustration .",
    "further , the close energy scales of the cef splitting ( @xmath120  k ) , kondo coherence ( @xmath121  k ) and the afm ( @xmath122  k ) generates a complex response of the physical properties to the application of magnetic field .",
    "the mr also reflects the multi - step phase structure , tracking each metamagnetic transition with a sharp step , indicating the presence kondo coupling between the ce magnetic moments and itinerant @xmath123-electrons from bi .",
    "the overall trend of mr is linear , a feature shared with the ( non - magnetic ) compounds laagbi@xmath1 and laagsb@xmath1 , where it is attributed to an underlying dirac dispersion for bi / sb itinerant electrons  @xcite .",
    "a preliminary ab initio calculation  @xcite for ceagbi@xmath15 indicates that the bi @xmath123-electrons also have a dirac dispersion , suggesting a similar origin for the underlying linear mr . however , we note an alternative explanation for the increase in mr is an enhancement in spin - disorder scattering in afm materials in an applied field  @xcite .",
    "note that the mr exhibits a sharp drop and hysteretic behavior near the @xmath124  koe transition , lending further support that it is first - order .",
    "motivated by this evidence for coupling of itinerant electrons and local moments , we performed measurements of the hall resistivity @xmath125 to further elucidate the nature of the different phases . like the mr ,",
    "the hall effect tracks each metamagnetic transition ( fig .  [ fig : halldata ] ) .    ) versus field .",

    "( b ) in a second sample , comparison at different @xmath4 while sweeping the field downward . ]",
    "the decrease in @xmath125 roughly parallels the increase in magnetization over the first two transitions , but then sharply deviates from this trend as the field is increased across the trio of transitions at 57 , 78 , and 84  koe , even changing its sign between @xmath127  koe .",
    "further insight is afforded by fitting the hall resistivity to the standard form @xmath128 that includes hall effect contributions from both the applied field and the induced magnetization . using the data up to @xmath129  koe to obtain the fit parameters , we find that this model fits the data extremely well for low fields @xmath130  koe , whereupon the measured @xmath125 strongly deviates from the expectation based on the model .",
    "while there is still some discrepancy between the fit and the data after the last transition ( @xmath131  koe ) , this is relatively small compared to the much larger deviation between fit and data in the regime @xmath119  koe  @xmath132  koe .",
    "as the temperature is raised , the magnitude of the anomaly in @xmath125 near 54  koe is decreased , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : halldata]b . at present",
    ", we do not have a complete understanding of the origin of this hall effect anomaly , but we comment on some possible scenarios below .",
    "we note that while there is an additional deviation from linear behavior of @xmath125 above @xmath133  koe , a previous study on lower - quality samples using pulsed fields up to @xmath134  koe  @xcite appears to rule out an additional transition .",
    "our results can be summarized in the form of a phase diagram of ceagbi@xmath1 with temperature and applied field , as shown in fig .  [",

    "note the strong agreement between the probes of specific heat , transport , and magnetic structure when the corresponding measurements overlap .",
    "of the sequence of transitions between the different low - temperature phases , the penultimate transition near 79  koe appears to be strongly first - order , whereas the remaining transitions appear continuous .",
    "as noted , the hall effect is well - described by a simple model including effects of both the applied field and induced magnetization very well below @xmath119  koe and reasonably well above @xmath104  koe , but exhibits a strong deviation from this simple behavior in the intermediate field regime .",
    "heavy fermion compounds ceausb@xmath1 and ybagge both have some commonalities in the low - temperature phase diagram .",
    "for instance , ceausb@xmath1 orders af and has at least one magnetic transition before the suppression of af order to 0  k at 54  koe.@xcite recent work suggests that the first transition might bifurcate into two at lower temperatures , similar to ceagbi@xmath1.@xcite ybagge also has a similarly complicated phase diagram as a function of field which contains a region partially bordered by a first order transition @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in this region ybagge exhibits anomalous behavior attributed to the influence of a quantum bicritical point @xcite . unlike in ybagge ,",
    "however , the set of transitions is only observed in ceagbi@xmath1 for @xmath138 .",
    "further , the large anomalies in the hall resistivity appear to be a feature unique to ceagbi@xmath1 .",
    "we now comment on potential explanations for the physics at hand .",
    "first , we attribute the sequence of metamagnetic transitions to the frustration from competing anisotropic exchange interactions , as evinced by the susceptibility data . as in many hfs ,",
    "the hall data is more challenging to describe @xcite .",
    "its evident sensitivity to the magnetization suggests a significant contribution from the induced magnetization at low fields , yet a simple phenomenological model incorporating this contribution seems unable to describe the behavior at intermediate fields .",
    "here we note that quantum oscillation measurements reveal electron effective masses in the range of 5 to 7 m@xmath139 , suggesting heavy fermion physics plays a role in transport  @xcite ; this could perhaps explain the anomaly , e.g. via a fermi surface reconstruction . to explore this scenario",
    ", one would have to investigate , for instance , band - structure calculations in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we anticipate that future theoretical analysis , incorporating details of the conduction electron band structure , as well as a careful treatment of their coupling to local moments , will shed more light on these issues  @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario involves the ` geometrical hall effect ' from a non - collinear spin texture ; while more exotic , such physics is now quite well - established as a consequence of dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions in ferromagnets and has been also proposed to occur in anisotropic exchange afms , and recently also in heavy - fermion metals  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "an anomalous hall effect could be observed as a result of a non - vanishing berry - phase curvature @xcite . to this end",
    ", neutron diffraction / scattering experiments would be valuable to unveil , for instance , the field regions where non - collinear spin structures are realized .",
    "as mentioned above , our previous model was unable to capture all field - induced magnetic transitions .",
    "finally , in the present section we introduce a spin model for the ce local moments to discuss their field - induced response .",
    "although more experimental investigation is clearly essential in order to clarify what type of afm order is stabilized in ceagbi@xmath1 in each field region , here we sketch one possible scenario built on existing experimental data on the closely - related compound cecubi@xmath1 , where the zero - field magnetic structure has already been well - established experimentally @xcite .",

    "however , a smaller single ion anisotropy @xmath153 admits a spin - flop transition at finite @xmath11-axis field , resulting in af spin canting .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental data . given that the minimal picture of competing spin exchanges and single ion anisotropy provide a reasonable explanation of magnetic ordering and field effect of cecubi@xmath1 material , we now turn to a similar analysis of ceagbi@xmath1 .     :",

    "moreover , the slight difference in lattice parameters and bond angles may also lead to changes in the rkky interactions induced by coupling to the itinerant electrons of bi .",

    "notably , even this simple model exhibits a plethora of magnetic orders separated by a sequence of metamagnetic transitions .    a convenient approach to understand the magnetic order is to separately consider every two layers of ce sites , corresponding to a single unit cell lattice spacing along the @xmath11 axis .",

    "<S> heavy fermion ( hf ) materials exhibit a rich array of phenomena due to the strong kondo coupling between their localized moments and itinerant electrons . </S>",
    "<S> a central question in their study is to understand the interplay between magnetic order and charge transport , and its role in stabilizing new quantum phases of matter . particularly promising in this regard </S>",
    "<S> is a family of tetragonal intermetallic compounds ce@xmath0@xmath1 ( @xmath2 transition metal , @xmath3 pnictogen ) , that includes a variety of hf compounds showing @xmath4-linear electronic specific heat @xmath5 , with @xmath6 20 - 500 mj@xmath7mol@xmath8  k@xmath9 , reflecting an effective mass enhancement ranging from small to modest . here , we study the low - temperature field - tuned phase diagram of high - quality ceagbi@xmath1 using magnetometry and transport measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we find an antiferromagnetic transition at @xmath10  k with weak magnetic anisotropy and the easy axis along the @xmath11-axis , similar to previous reports ( @xmath12  k ) . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario , along with the presence of two anisotropic ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interactions , leads to a rich field - tuned magnetic phase diagram , consisting of five metamagnetic transitions of both first and second order . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we unveil an anomalous hall contribution for fields @xmath13 koe which is drastically altered when @xmath14 is tuned through a trio of transitions at 57 , 78 , and 84  koe , suggesting that the fermi surface is reconstructed in a subset of the metamagnetic transitions .            in heavy fermion ( hf ) materials , </S>",
    "<S> the kondo coupling between local moments and itinerant electrons plays a central role in determining magnetic and transport properties , particularly at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> classic examples of the unusual behavior include quantum criticality in ybrh@xmath15si@xmath15  @xcite , unconventional superconductivity in cecoin@xmath16  @xcite , and metamagnetism in ceru@xmath15si@xmath15  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ce - based hf materials which host such exciting properties often crystallize in tetragonal structures and their ground state is on the border of antiferromagnetism ( afm ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our focus in this paper is the hf family ce__tx__@xmath1 ( @xmath17 transition metal , @xmath18 pnictogen ) , a class of intermetallic compounds that crystallize in the tetragonal zrcusi@xmath1-type structure ( space group @xmath19 ) with a stacking arrangement of ce@xmath20-@xmath4-ce@xmath20-@xmath20 layers . </S>",
    "<S> great attention has been given to the antimonide ( @xmath18 sb ) members due to the presence of anomalous ferromagnetism in ceagsb@xmath15 and , more recently , due to the report of field - induced quantum criticality in ceausb@xmath15 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the investigation of the antimonides is abundant , fewer reports can be found on the bismuthide ( @xmath18 bi ) members . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies of high - quality cecubi@xmath15 and ceaubi@xmath1 revealed afm ordering temperatures of @xmath2116  k and 12  k , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> both materials show a moderate mass enhancement from @xmath4-linear electronic specific heat ( @xmath22 on the order of 100 mj@xmath7mol@xmath8  k@xmath9 ) and exhibit a single spin - flop transition with field applied along the @xmath11-axis @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> ceagbi@xmath1 , a third member of the isovalent series , has been reported previously to order antiferromagnetically ( @xmath31  k ) at zero magnetic field and to undergo three field - induced magnetic transitions at 2  k ( @xmath32  koe ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a detailed analysis of the underlying interactions and a deep understanding of the phase diagram at low temperatures is still missing .    single crystals of ceagbi@xmath1 were grown from bi - flux with starting composition ce : ag : bi=1:@xmath33:8 ( @xmath34 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mixture was placed in an alumina crucible and sealed in a quartz tube under vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the sealed tube was heated up to @xmath35 for 8 h and then cooled down at @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the excess of bi flux was removed by centrifugation after 24 h of annealing at @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> single crystals with dimensions @xmath38 mm@xmath39 were ground and their crystal structure was checked by x - ray powder diffraction experiments using cu @xmath40 radiation at room temperature . </S>",

    "<S> we have extracted the actual @xmath41 concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the precision of the analysis was calculated by @xmath42/@xmath43 , where @xmath42 is the standard deviation of the measurements , and @xmath44 is the number of points analyzed .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetization measurements were performed using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) down to 1.8 k. below 1.8 k , cantilever - based torque magnetometry was used to measure the magnetization in a dilution refrigerator . </S>",

    "<S> hall data was obtained by measuring in both positive and negative applied fields and taking the difference ( @xmath45/2 $ ] ) . due to hysteresis in the transitions data </S>",
    "<S> was paired for subtraction based on whether the magnitude of the field was increasing or decreasing . </S>",
    "<S> all measurements reported here , except for some of the magnetic susceptibility measurements , were made with the applied field parallel to the c - axis . for resistivity measurements , </S>",
