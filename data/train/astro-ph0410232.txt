    "have been compared to stellar sizes based on diameters found in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these diameters are often widely spaced in time and stellar phase from the measurements of the sio maser shell .",
    "sometimes the stellar diameters have not been measured at all and comparisons are made with even less precise diameter estimates based on the luminosity of the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these examples demonstrate that it is desirable to compare sio maser ring diameters with stellar diameter estimates , and highlight the need for contemporaneous multi - wavelength observations .",
    "using the vlba and vlti / vinci , we have undertaken a coordinated multi - wavelength study of the mira variable s ori .",
    "the vlba observations resulted in the first interferometric images of the @xmath56 , 43.1-ghz and the @xmath1 , 42.8-ghz sio transitions .",
    "these images show that the masers lie in a clumpy ring - like distribution .",
    "analysis of the vlba images provided mean distances from center of 9.4  mas ( 4.0  au ) and 8.8  mas ( 3.7  au ) and standard deviations of 1.4  mas ( 0.6  au ) and 1.7  mas ( 0.7  au ) for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 sio masers respectively at a stellar phase of 0.73 . from near - infrared @xmath2-band visibility measurements made with vlti / vinci , we derived ud diameters that decreased over time from @xmath510.5mas at stellar phase 0.80 to @xmath510.2mas at phase 0.95 .",
    "after extrapolating the ud diameter to the phase of our vlba observations and considering a correction from ud diameter to continuum photospheric size , we determine a photospheric diameter of @xmath57mas , corresponding to a linear radius of @xmath58au .    because these observations of s ori were closely spaced in time in a coordinated effort between the two instruments , we are able to relate the stellar diameter with the size of the sio maser shell without the uncertainty caused by the inherent variability of the star .",
    "thus we can conclusively say that the sio masers lie relatively close to the stellar photosphere at a distance of @xmath52r@xmath55 at the time of our observations .",
    "the observations presented here represent the first in a series of coordinated vlba / vlti experiments to study long - period variable stars .",
    "the present vlti observations were obtained during the commissioning period of the vlti with the commissioning instrument vinci and the small ( 40 cm ) test siderostats .",
    "future observations will utilize the scientific vlti instruments in the mid - infrared ( midi ) and near - infrared ( amber ) with the 8  m unit telescopes and 1.8  m auxiliary telescopes .",
    "the upcoming near - infrared vlti instrument amber will allow interferometric measurements in the near - infrared @xmath12 , @xmath59 , and @xmath2 bands with a spectral resolution of up to 10000 , and will provide closure phases .",
    "this will enable us to directly measure the the continuum stellar diameter and to study the conditions on the stellar surface , including possible asymmetries and surface inhomogeneities .",
    "the near - infrared results are based on public data collected at the eso vlti , paranal , chile , in the framework of our p70 shared risk program .",
