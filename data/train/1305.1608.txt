    "the engineering of layered hybrid heterostructures for spintronics applications , which are apt to simultaneously generate , manipulate and detect electron spin - polarized currents , sends a formidable challenge to modern material science and technology.@xcite the information obtained from combining traditional semiconductors with magnetic materials indicates the key influence of the interface between the constituents on magnetic properties of the heterostructure.@xcite the electronic rearrangement at the interface , often accompanied by appearance of spin - polarized bound states on both sides of the boundary , is the central feature inherent in the hybrid heterostructures .",
    "this feature underlies the magnetic proximity effect when spin ordering penetrates inside semiconductor over the interface.@xcite naturally one asks what are the peculiarities of the magnetic proximity effect provided that a trivial band semiconductor in the hybrid heterostructure is replaced by a time - reversal - invariant semiconductor with inverted band gap driven by strong intrinsic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , which is now known as a three dimensional topological insulator ( 3d ti).@xcite a characteristic feature of the heterostructures containing the 3d ti layers is the topologically protected electron helical states with the linear dirac - cone - like energy - momentum dispersion living at a boundary between topologically nonequivalent regions ( such as between ti and a conventional , i.e. topologically trivial , insulator).@xcite when ti is in contact with a magnetic material , the interface states can be influenced by a presence of magnetic ordering via time reversal symmetry breaking . because of the dirac spectrum and spin - momentum locking in such the systems , an interplay between the interface states and magnetism is naturally expected to display novel behavior that is absent in the case of the heterostructure composed of a conventional semiconductor and a magnetic material . in integrating of tis with magnetic materials ,",
    "fundamental issue is characterization of electron properties of the interface to understand the mechanisms of an exchange coupling .",
    "the design of the heterostructures made of ti and magnetic layers has the potential to achieve a strong and uniform exchange coupling between the layers without significant spin dependent random scattering of helical carriers on magnetic atoms .",
    "the main challenge is to find suitable magnetic material , which can form a high - quality contact with ti and , at the same time , provides a strong exchange coupling at the interface .",
    "unfortunately magnetic metals are out of the range of the search since they naturally short circuit the ti layer , restricting fundamentally the device design .",
    "the film of a ferromagnetic insulator or semiconductor ( below we will use the abbreviation fmi ) adjacent to ti is a most promising candidate to manipulate the helical states of 3d ti by means of a magnetic proximity effect.@xcite such a way may diminish the surface scattering via continuum states of the magnetic film , contrary to the metallic film case .",

    "the magnetic and magnetotransport measurements on the bi@xmath5se@xmath6/eus bilayers indicated eloquently that eus induces ferromagnetic order with a significant magnetic moment in the interfacial region of the bi@xmath5se@xmath6 layer due to a transmission of the exchange field across the interface.@xcite    of magnetic insulators that show relatively good lattice matching with binary tis bi@xmath5te@xmath6 , bi@xmath5se@xmath6 and sb@xmath5te@xmath6 , one can note the wide - gap antiferromagnetic insulator ( afmi ) mnse.@xcite the authors of ref .",

    "the same one can refer to an attempt to go beyond the scope of the 2d model.@xcite    in the present paper , within the framework of the continual approach , we study the physics of magnetic proximity effect at the ti / fmi heterocontact .",
    "this model generalizes an approach recently proposed to describe the electron states formed by the interface between ti and normal insulator ( ni).@xcite as was shown in ref .",
    "the boundary between ti and a trivial insulator hosts a pair of the bound electron states inside the bulk energy gap of ti on the topological side of the interface ( referred as the topological and ordinary states ) , which differ from each other in physical meaning , spatial distribution and energy spectrum .",

    "iv the behavior of the topological interface state under the influence of the exchange field associated with the ordinary state is described .",
    "we show how the proximity of the fmi modifies the energy spectrum of the topological state and obtain the expression for the energy gap . in sec .",
    "v , we analyze the obtained results and compare them with the recent _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations for the bi@xmath5se@xmath6/mnse superlattice.@xcite",
    "we consider a conceptual analytic model for the magnetic proximity effect in the ti / fmi structure .",
    "the low energy and long wavelength bulk electron states of the prototypical ti , narrow - gap semiconductor of bi@xmath5se@xmath6-type , are described near the @xmath19 point of the brillouin zone by the four bands @xmath0 hamiltonian with strong soc proposed in ref .  .",
    "without a loss of generality , we make use the simplified version of this hamiltonian in the form : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the wave vector , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) denote the pauli matrices in the spin and orbital space , respectively .",

    "we introduce the fmi as a wide - gap semiconductor in which the exchange potential of local magnetic moments induces uniform spin splitting of both the conduction and valence bands in the bulk .",

    "such the assumption is not evident , since the effective scale of @xmath63 defined by the debye screening length , @xmath80 , may significantly exceed a characteristic metal screening length due to a relatively low carrier concentration in ti .",

    "the scale of @xmath67 is at least one order of magnitude lower as compared to @xmath80 , hence in this case the `` local '' approximation is correct .",
    "third , we average the redistributions @xmath60 and @xmath64 over the @xmath81 plane remaining one - dimensional profiles @xmath82 and @xmath83 . as a result of the aforesaid approximations we arrive at the following relations @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "the hybridization potential @xmath88 spreads over a small region @xmath89 ( of the order a lattice parameter ) around the geometrical boundary @xmath46 , where the @xmath0 scheme is not valid .",

    "in the context of the magnetic proximity effect , we are interested to know how the induced exchange field @xmath232 , applied along the @xmath43 axis , affects the electron spectrum of the topological state . therefore we treat the potential energy @xmath235 as a perturbation and remain only the exchange part @xmath236 , where @xmath237 , the function @xmath177 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ spin - dens-01 ] ) and ( [ f ] ) .",
    "to estimate the modification of the topological state near the dirac point under the exchange field , we utilize the method similar to the perturbation theory treatment for electron terms with close eigenenergies.@xcite indeed , near the dirac point @xmath238 , there are energies in the spectrum of the unperturbed topological state , @xmath239 , the difference between which does not exceed the perturbation value @xmath240 .",
    "for the perturbed envelope function @xmath241 we employ the ansatz having the same spatial dependence of eq .",
    "( [ topo - func-0 ] ) , but the variable spinor structure @xmath242 that is driven by the perturbation . to seek for the factors",

    "the perturbation violates a parity between the minority and majority spin orientations of the electron states along the @xmath43 axis in accordance with @xmath248    ergo , the induced exchange field associated with the ordinary state penetrates into the ti host over distance on the order of @xmath226 to break the time reversal symmetry . as a consequence , the energy gap opens in the dirac spectrum of the interface topological state @xmath249 ( [ spectrum - topo ] ) .",
    "the gap size is directly proportional to the fmi magnetization and determined by the overlap of the ordinary state spin polarization and the topological state electron density , eq .",
    "( [ overlap ] ) . as follows from eqs .",
    "( [ p - and - q ] ) , ( [ spin - dens-01 ] ) and ( [ overlap ] ) , the induced gap size @xmath250 is limited by a number of factors : the intermixing intensity of the ti and fmi states at the interface , @xmath251 ; the ti bulk band structure , @xmath252 ; the fermi level position , @xmath182 , defining the ti states filling ; and the exchange interaction strength in the ti bulk , @xmath253 .",
    "the fact used in the present work is that the topological and ordinary states respond highly distinctly to the perturbation created by the ti / fmi interface .",
    "we show that the gap opens at the dirac point of the topological state due to the exchange field originated from the spin polarized ordinary state .",
    "we conclude that the exchange coupling transfer through the mediation of the ordinary state is a key aspect of the mechanism of achieving interplay between fmi and the helical state in ti .",
    "in this study , we have succeeded in understanding of the physical mechanism for magnetic proximity effect in the ti / fmi heterostructures , by using a rather simple model for both insulators and phenomenologically regarding the interface mixing between their states but ignoring the fine details of the interface on atomic scale .",
    "we have applied the envelope function method to study the in - gap bound states at the ti / fmi interface , wherein the narrow - gap semiconductor with inverted band structure is in the contact with the wide - gap magnetic semiconductor with normal band structure . within the continual approach , to analytically describe the ordinary and topological interface states and interplay between them we have used the perturbation theory in the terms of the interface potential and the local approximation for an electron - electron interaction .",
    "it is no reason to think that there will be a qualitative difference with the obtained results when the self - consistent electrostatic and exchange fields are taken into account in the presence of an arbitrarily strong interface potential .",
    "nevertheless the question about the electron density rearrangement within the interface region on the ti side is highly important to discuss it .",
    "it is particularly specific of the prototypical 3d tis belonging to the bi@xmath4se@xmath3 family , which are narrow - gap semiconductors , that the screening scale is typically on the order of a quintuple thickness , i.e. @xmath2541 nm . it means that the fields @xmath61 and @xmath65 figuring in eq .",
    "( [ h - t - til ] ) , in strict sense , are neither long - range nor short - range fields .",
    "therefore each of the limit treatments , the renormalization of the interface potential ( that would be under the condition @xmath255 ) or the semiclassical treatment ( that would be suited under the condition @xmath256 ) , is the approximation for the fields @xmath61 and @xmath65 that can yield only qualitative estimation for the spatial variation of electron density near the interface . to improve the description of the ti / fmi contact on the specific scale @xmath257",
    ", it should be reasonable one to utilize a fitting procedure with the sectionally continuous functions @xmath86 and @xmath144 , for example , in the form of a rectangular or triangular potential well attached to the interface , where the value @xmath258 may , in principle , exceed the bulk energy gap and thus may significantly shift the energy spectrum @xmath259 of the ordinary states relative to the bulk energy spectrum of ti .",
    "it is evident that such the modification of the model can not change the principle conclusion about the mechanism of the magnetic proximity effect in the system under investigation .",
    "an exchange field inside ti may also be induced by placing ti in contact with afmi due to the presence of uncompensated magnetization in the outermost afmi layer .",
    "the recent density functional theory ( dft ) first - principles calculations for the bi@xmath5se@xmath6/mnse superlattice expounded in ref .   has examined in detail the magnetic proximity effect near the 3d ti / afmi ( mnse ) interface .",
    "it was shown that the charge redistribution and mixing of the bi@xmath5se@xmath6 and mnse orbitals at the interface brings on drastic modification of the electron structure with respect to the pristine bi@xmath5se@xmath6 surface .",
    "the calculation results reveal the presence of the ordinary state with probability maximum near the interface plane .",
    "this state penetrates into the first interfacial quintuple layer of ti . at the @xmath19 point",
    ", it appears in the local bulk valence band gap owing to the near - interface band bending of @xmath260 ev .",
    "this state is gapped ( 56 mev ) and spin polarized due to the hybridization of the ti and afmi states . on the other hand",
    ", the probability maximum of the dirac topological state relocates from the first quintuple layer to the second one , leaving directly unattainable for a magnetic perturbation from mnse .",
    "the interface ordinary state mediates an exchange coupling between afmi and the topological state due to an overlap of the topological and trivial interface states within the first interfacial quintuple layer .",
    "the topological state acquires the energy gap of @xmath2548.5 mev proportional to the overlap .",
    "the magnetic proximity effect in the ti / magnetic insulator ( fmi or afmi ) hybrid structures is rather intricate phenomenon . the analytical continual model developed here and the dft results of ref .",
    "are in good qualitative agreement with each other .",
    "they unveil the unique route for the penetration of the exchange field into ti including three stages : the magnetic insulator magnetization @xmath261 the interface ordinary state @xmath261 the interface topological state .",
    "it is likely that our results would be highly helpful for the analysis of the feasibility of recently proposed unusual physical effects in tis and the  tailor - made \" structures on their base , such as anomalous quantum hall effect,@xcite magnetic monopole imaging,@xcite topological contribution to the faraday and kerr effects,@xcite inverse spin - galvanic effect.@xcite our findings could provide guidelines to engineer spintronic device applications , for instance , the ti - based _",
    "p - n _ junctions@xcite and memory device based on the ti surface coated with a magnetic insulator film.@xcite    in summary , our analysis provides insight into the microscopic mechanism of the proximity effect in the ti / fmi hybrid structure .",
    "the nature of the proximity effect is tangled enough .",
    "the delicate moment is the presence of the ordinary state as a mediator for the spin polarization transmission over the interface from fmi to the topological state .",
    "we have distinguished way for modifying the spectrum of the topological state through the interface - induced exchange field that breaks time reversal symmetry , giving rise to the gap opening at the dirac point in the topological state spectrum .",
