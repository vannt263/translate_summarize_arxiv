    "mesons and baryons are the relevant degrees of freedom in strong interaction physics in the few gev energy regime .",
    "the study of the interaction of mesons with nuclei has provided important information on the strong force in this energy range .",
    "while the interaction of long lived charged mesons like @xmath7 or k@xmath8 with nuclei can be studied with secondary meson beams , the majority of short - lived mesons can only be investigated by producing them on a nucleus and using the same nucleus as a laboratory for studying their interaction with the medium .",
    "a question of particular interest is whether this interaction is attractive and strong enough to form bound states of mesons and nuclei .",
    "the existence of deeply bound @xmath9-nucleus states has been established in a series of measurements at the fragment separator frs at gsi @xcite by studying recoil - free production of @xmath9-mesons in the ( d,@xmath10 reaction on various pb and sn isotopes .",
    "the widths of these states were found to be about 1/10 of the binding energy which is essential for their experimental identification .",
    "the origin of these states is due to a superposition of the attractive coulomb force and the repulsive s - wave @xmath9-nucleus interaction which gives rise to a potential pocket , leading to a halo - like @xmath9 distribution around the nucleus @xcite .",
    "it is of utmost importance for our understanding of the strong interaction whether neutral mesons which are only subject to the strong interaction can also form meson - nucleus bound states .",
    "theoretical predictions for @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath0 @xcite , and @xmath12 @xcite mesic states have been made . in case of the @xmath11-meson",
    "the predicted widths are comparable to or even larger than the binding energies .",
    "this implies the strength of these states partially extends into the continuum , allowing for free meson emission .",
    "experimental indications for surprisingly large @xmath11 yields in coherent @xmath11 photo production near threshold have been reported @xcite .",
    "similar observations have been made by the cosy - anke collaboration by studying the @xmath13 reaction @xcite . in both cases , the very strong rise of the cross section near threshold",
    "is taken to be indicative of a quasi - bound state close to threshold .",
    "a direct observation of an @xmath11 bound state has been claimed by the cosy - gem collaboration in the @xmath14 reaction @xcite . for the d+d@xmath15 reaction , only an upper limit for the population of an @xmath11 bound state",
    "was reported by the wasa@cosy collaboration @xcite .",
    "the case for @xmath16 mesic states appears to be promising experimentally because of the relatively narrow in - medium width of the @xmath16-meson of about 20 mev at normal nuclear matter density as determined in a transparency ratio measurement @xcite .",

    "we report on a search for @xmath0 mesic states in a photo nuclear reaction exploiting near recoil - free @xmath0 production . in a ( @xmath17 ) reaction on a nuclear target ,",
    "the forward going proton takes over most of the momentum of the incoming photon beam , leaving the @xmath0-meson almost at rest so it can be captured by the nucleus in case of an attractive @xmath0-nucleus interaction . for a nucleon at rest",
    ", recoilless production occurs at an incident photon energy of 2.7 gev , but - as discussed in @xcite -momentum transfers to the @xmath0-meson are less than about 400 mev/@xmath18 within the whole energy range between 1250 - 3100 mev as long as the outgoing proton is confined to laboratory polar angles of @xmath19 .",
    "it is important to exploit the full incident photon energy range as the cross section for slow @xmath0-mesons , going backwards in the center - of - mass system , is about 10 times larger at @xmath20 = 1.2 gev than at 2.7 gev @xcite . in the search for @xmath0 mesic states",
    "one has to be aware of the large in - medium width of the @xmath0-meson , determined to be @xmath21 = 140 mev at normal nuclear matter density for recoil momenta of 1.1 gev/@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this may make it difficult to observe distinct structures in the cross section , indicating the formation of an @xmath0 mesic state , even though the @xmath0 momenta and thus the @xmath0 width in the present experiment are expected to be much smaller than in @xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed at the electron stretcher accelerator elsa in bonn , using the combined crystal barrel ( cb ) ( 1320 csi modules ) @xcite and minitaps detectors ( 216 baf@xmath22 modules ) @xcite subtending polar angles of 11@xmath23 and @xmath19 , respectively , and the full azimuthal angular range , thereby covering 96@xmath24 of the full solid angle .",
    "tagged photons with energies of 0.65 - 3.1 gev , produced via bremsstrahlung at a rate of 6 - 10 mhz , impinged on a 15 mm thick @xmath25 target , corresponding to 6@xmath24 of a radiation length @xmath26 . as a reference measurement , a lh@xmath22 target of 5.1 cm length ( 0.6@xmath24  of  @xmath27 ) was irradiated under the same experimental conditions .",
    "the photon flux through the target was determined by counting the photons reaching the @xmath28 intensity detector at the end of the setup in coincidence with electrons registered in the tagging system .",
    "the data were collected during two running periods of 830  h and 450  h for the c and lh@xmath22 target , respectively .",
    "events with @xmath29 candidates were selected with suitable multiplicity trigger conditions , requiring at least one hit in minitaps and more than two hits in the cb , derived from a fast cluster recognition encoder . a more detailed description of the detector setup and the running conditions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-mesons were identified via the @xmath30 decay channel , which has a branching ratio of 8.3% @xcite . for the reconstruction of the @xmath0-proton    pairs , only events with exactly 3 neutral hits and 1 charged",

    "protons were identified in the baf@xmath22 modules of minitaps by exploiting the characteristic correlation between deposited energy and time - of - flight ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : p_band ] ) .",
    "in addition , an aerogel cherenkov detector with an index of refraction of n=1.05 was used to veto electrons and charged pions in the angular range covered by minitaps .",
    "events of interest were selected and the background suppressed by several kinematical cuts .",
    "only events with incident photon energies larger than 1250 mev were processed .",
    "a @xmath31 cut on the missing mass , calculated for the @xmath2 pair and the entrance channel , was applied .",
    "photons were required to have energies larger than 50 mev ( to suppress shower splittings ) and to be in the polar angular range of 14@xmath32 to 156@xmath32 while protons had to be in the polar angular range 1@xmath32 - 11@xmath32 . with the 3 photons per event the invariant mass of all photon pairs was calculated and the one combination closest to the @xmath33 mass of 135 mev/@xmath34 was taken to be the @xmath33 .",
    "the energy of the bachelor photon was then requested to be larger than 200 mev to suppress background from @xmath35 and @xmath36 events .",
    "events with rescattered @xmath33-mesons from @xmath37 decays within the nucleus were suppressed by requesting the kinetic energy of the @xmath33 to be larger than 120 mev @xcite .",

    "projections onto the respective axes exhibit clear signals above a background arising from @xmath35 , @xmath38 events where one of the 4 photons in the final state escaped undetected . for determining the background contributions from the @xmath35 and @xmath36 channels , events with 1 charged hit in minitaps and 4 neutral hits elsewhere were analyzed .",
    "applying the method developed in @xcite , this background was directly determined from the data in an analysis of the 4 photon events by arbitrarily omitting one of the 4 photons , irrespective of photon angle and energy , and otherwise applying the same cuts .",
    "the background shape is nicely reproduced by this analysis of 4 photon events .",
    "the background spectra were normalized to the background in the signal spectra outside of the signal region ( 400 mev/@xmath39 mev/@xmath34 and 864 mev/@xmath40 mev/@xmath34 ) , separately for the different momentum bins indicated in fig .",

    "@xmath2 pairs with invariant masses between 400 to 1200 mev/@xmath34 were produced in coincidence with protons going into the angular range of @xmath42 covered by the minitaps array for the incident photon energy range of 1250 - 3100 mev .",

    "after a two dimensional subtraction of the background from the data ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : plane ] ) the remaining signal counts are corrected for acceptance bin by bin .",
    "systematic uncertainties in the cross section determinations arise from the background subtraction in the determination of the @xmath0 yield , mainly from the normalization of the 4 neutral hit events ( 10 - 15@xmath24 ) , from the acceptance simulation ( 5@xmath24 ) , the photon flux determination ( 5 - 10@xmath24 , see @xcite ) , and uncertainties in the photon initial state interaction ( photon shadowing @xcite ) .",

    "the experimental data are compared to monte carlo simulations requesting the detection of a proton in minitaps ( @xmath19 ) . for the carbon target the simulation takes the fermi motion of nucleons into account which leads to the observed broadening of the energy distribution .",
    "it is remarkable that the distributions measured on the lh@xmath22 and c targets peak at almost the same kinetic energy ( c : 60.5@xmath67 mev ; lh@xmath22 : 60.3@xmath63.1 mev ) , corresponding to @xmath0 momenta of about 300 mev/@xmath18 , about a factor two larger than the average momentum of nucleons bound in carbon .",
    "this is due to the fact that the forward going proton takes over most of the momentum of the incoming photon beam .",
    "being so low in energy , the @xmath0-mesons are sensitive to the @xmath0 nucleus potential . in case of a strong repulsive ( attractive ) interaction one would expect the peak in the kinetic energy distribution to be shifted to higher ( lower ) energies for the c target . in the comparison of the kinetic energy distributions for the lh@xmath22 and carbon targets one has to consider that for the latter the photo production of the @xmath0-meson occurs off a bound nucleon which sees a nuclear potential as well .",
    "the participant nucleon emerging from the nucleus is subject to this potential which is known to be momentum dependent @xcite .",
    "studies taking these effects into account are under way @xcite .    both distributions fall off rather steeply towards negative energies",

    "the effective branching ratio for in medium @xmath48 decays of about 1.5 @xmath24 ( see below ) a population cross section of @xmath49 nb / mev / sr was deduced which is of the order of magnitude expected for the formation of @xmath0 mesic states @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution exhibits some tailing towards lower @xmath0 masses for the carbon target which is not observed for the lh@xmath22 target .",

    "the calculations have been performed for an imaginary potential of @xmath50= - 70 mev , as determined by transparency ratio measurements @xcite , assuming different depths of the real potential .",
    "the cross sections for the formation of @xmath51b bound states have been calculated including the optical potential for the @xmath0 and the forward going proton . by averaging over the incident photon energy range of 1250 - 3100 mev and the proton angle ( @xmath19 ) , the cross sections shown in fig .",

    "being a semi - classical non - equilibrium description of hadronic processes , the gibuu transport model can not describe the population of quantum - mechanical bound states but it can calculate the absorption and decay of @xmath0-mesons which can not leave the nucleus and are thus bound to it since their total energy is @xmath53 - 782 mev@xmath54 0 . the resulting branching ratio is shown in fig .

    ", the branching ratio does , however , not reach the value for the free @xmath37 decay of 8.3@xmath24 since a fraction of @xmath0 decays still occurs in the nuclear medium in competition to @xmath0 absorption .",

    "another source of systematic errors is the uncertainty in extracting the energy dependent branching ratio from the gibuu code which has been estimated from the variation of the branching ratio for different in - medium modification scenarios .",
