    "one possibility is to postulate that the local lorentz transformation has to be modified to include the local quantum modification of the speed of light , while the formalism of classical general relativity is unaltered by the quantum modification .",
    "let us also assume that the `` local lorentz transformation '' , under the presence of the quantum correction  , is formulated to be the transformation which preserves the light element @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a space - time interval , and @xmath36 is the speed of light in the local coordinate system .",
    "the correction @xmath31 given in eq .",
    "is compatible with the einstein equivalence principle of a locally flat space - time and therefore does not change the dirac equation ( with parameter @xmath37 ) in the usual dirac equation for fermion wave packets , but the quantum correction @xmath32 , given in eq .  , leads to the replacement @xmath38 .",
    "according to eq .  , high - energy fermions are faster than light rays at high energy , by an offset @xmath39 , making them effectively superluminal , thus leading to an explanation for the early neutrino burst from the supernova 1978a ( see refs .",
    "the preferred way to describe highly energetic fermions ( neutrinos ) which travel faster than light is via the tachyonic dirac equation  @xcite , which in the local reference frame reads as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fermion wave function .",
    "the projector sums for the tachyonic spinor solutions have recently been investigated in refs .",

    ", linear with the energy scale , of the functional form @xmath47 it thus becomes clear that the mere existence of a `` local '' gravitational quantum correction of the functional form   would induce severe problems in the description of high - energy fermions in local reference frames in strong gravitational fields ( `` deep potentials '' ) .",

    "@xcite , high - energy neutrinos would be traveling faster than light , but not faster than electrons . hence , the analogue of cerenkov radiation emitted by neutrinos , namely , the reaction @xmath48 can not occur ; according to ref .",

    "@xcite is quite subtle ; however , the functional form   allows for a direct model - independent comparison with bounds on the @xmath2 parameter introduced in eq .",
    ", as discussed in sec .  [ sec2a ] .      the schiff conjecture ( see sec",
    "2.2.1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is connected with two different forms of the equivalence principle , namely , the weak equivalence principle and the einstein equivalence principle .",
    "originally , newton stated that the property of a body called `` mass '' ( `` inertial mass '' ) is proportional to the `` weight '' ( which enters the gravitational force law ) , a principle otherwise known as the `` weak equivalence principle '' ( wep ) . the einstein equivalence principle ( eep )",
    "states that _ ( i ) _ wep is valid , _",
    "( ii ) _ the outcome of any local non - gravitational experiment is independent of the velocity of the freely - falling reference frame in which it is performed ( local lorentz invariance , lli ) , _ ( iii ) _ the outcome of any local non - gravitational experiment is independent of where and when in the universe it is performed ( local position invariance , lpi ) .    it is obvious to realize that the existence of a local modification of the speed of light in deep gravitational potentials according to   would lead to a ( very slight , but noticeable ) violation of point _",
    "( iii ) _ of the eep .",
    "namely , because the shift @xmath32 affects only photons , not neutrinos or electrons ( according to ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one could measure the local propagation velocity of high - energy fermion versus photon wave packets .",
    "the former propagate at velocity @xmath5 in a local reference frame , whereas the latter are affected by the correction  @xmath52 .",
    "the potential @xmath15 depends on the position in the universe where the experiment is performed ( for reference values of @xmath15 in different regions , see table  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    according to sec .",
    "2.2.1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the schiff conjecture states that for self - consistent theories of gravity , wep necessarily embodies eep ; the validity of wep alone guarantees the validity of local lorentz and position invariance , and thereby of eep .",
    "the question of whether the correction @xmath53 violates the wep is a matter of interpretation because @xmath53 affects only massless objects , namely , photons ; it is , as already emphasized , a _ quantum _ effect which goes beyond the scope of classical mechanics in which the weak equivalence principle was first formulated ( in its original form by newton ) .",
    "one could perform a thought experiment and enter a region of deep gravitational potential with three freely falling , propagating wave packets , one describing a photon , the others describing a very highly energetic neutrino and a very highly energetic electron , respectively .",
    "the latter two propagate at a velocity ( infinitesimally close to ) @xmath5 .",
    "if a correction of the form @xmath32 exists , then photons will have been decelerated to a velocity @xmath54 within the deep gravitational potential , whereas _ both _ fermions will have retained a velocity ( infinitesimally close to ) @xmath5 .",
    "if we regard the photons as particles ( the photon being a concept introduced into physics after the wep was first introduced by newton ) , then we could argue that a `` force '' must have acted onto the photon , causing deceleration , even though the particles were in free fall .",
    "this might indicate a violation of the wep but only if the photon were regarded as a normal `` particle '' in the sense of newton s idea ( which is not fully applicable because of the vanishing rest mass of the photon ) .",
    "alternatively , we could interpret any change in velocities relative to the local speed of light as an `` acceleration '' and thus interpret the faster propagation of the electrons and neutrinos in comparison to the photon within the region of deep gravitational potential as the result of a force which must have acted on the fermions .",
    "_ both _ neutrinos and electrons retain a velocity very close to @xmath5 and have thus been accelerated by the same velocity @xmath39 ; because of their different rest mass , the force acting on them must have been different , thus violating the wep .",
    "today , one canonically understands the wep as not being tied to `` massive '' objects , stating that free - fall at a given point in space - time is the same for all physical systems , and that photons , electrons , and neutrinos in a gravitational potential all act as if they are in the same accelerated coordinate frame . in that sense , if a theory predicts that gravitational potentials make the local photon velocity different from the local limiting velocity of high - energy massive particles , then that theory violates the wep .",
    "thus , depending on the interpretation , one might conclude that schiff s conjecture holds true , in the sense that the correction   violates _ both _ the wep as well as the eep .",
    "the caveat must be stated because strictly speaking , photons do not have a rest mass , and thus , the wep in the original formulation is not fully applicable .",
    "one should also bear in mind that slight violations of fundamental laws and symmetries of nature are being discussed and all we can do is establish bounds for violating parameters  @xcite . for the scenario studied by vachaspati ( see appendix  [ appb ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the violations of the eep and the wep would be of order unity ; the `` light speed measured in absolute time '' can be different from the `` light speed measured in electromagnetic time '' , depending on the relative velocity of the moving frames @xmath55 .",
    "the far - reaching consequences of any correction of the form   to the speed of light in deep gravitational potentials together with the bound formulated in eq .   for the @xmath18 coefficient stimulate a recalculation of the leading gravitational correction to vacuum polarization , supplementing the analysis of ref .  @xcite .",
