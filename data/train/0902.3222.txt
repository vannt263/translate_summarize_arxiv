    "supersonic turbulence plays an important role in shaping hierarchical internal substructure of molecular clouds ( mcs ) .",
    "since the process of star formation begins with the formation of dense cores , turbulence can be responsible for creating initial conditions for star formation .",
    "it is hard to access the supersonic regimes typical for mc turbulence in the laboratory and the information available from observations is also limited .",
    "thus numerical simulations currently represent the only way to explore the statistics of supersonic turbulence , the key ingredient of any successful statistical theory of star formation @xcite . for a long time , the nature of _ highly compressible _ and _ magnetized _ interstellar turbulence remained poorly understood .",
    "we use large - scale numerical simulations to shed light on the energy transfer between scales and on the key spatial correlations of relevant fields in these flows .",
    "in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter k07 ) we showed that homogeneous isotropic turbulence in a strongly compressible regime typical for the interstellar gas can be approximated by modified kolmogorov s laws since nonlinear advection still remains the major physical process at work in the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "the essence of the required modification boils down to the use of proper density weighting for the gas velocity , which we call the `` 1/3-rule '' of supersonic turbulence . replacing the velocity @xmath2 by @xmath3",
    ", one can show that for this quantity the 4/5-law of @xcite approximately holds at sonic mach number as large as @xmath4 , when the plain velocity power spectrum already scales as in burgers turbulence , i.e. @xmath5 .    [ figone ]    the first von  krmn  howarth ( 1938 ) relation between the second - order transverse and longitudinal velocity structure functions also still holds approximately at @xmath4 .",
    "although there is no rigorous proof for any of these two fundamental exact incompressible laws in supersonic regimes , the evidence provided by numerical experiments helps extend kolmogorov s phenomenology to a wider class of problems of interest in turbulence research and astrophysics . in k07",
    "we showed that the low - order statistics of @xmath3 are invariant with respect to changes in the mach number .",
    "for instance , the slope of the power spectrum is  @xmath6 , and the exponent of the third - order structure function @xmath7 is unity , @xmath8 .",
    "here we report on our more recent simulation with a grid resolution of @xmath0 carried out with the enzo code on _ bigben _ ( psc ) and on _ ranger _ ( tacc ) using 4096 cores ( fig .",
    "[ figone ] ) .",
    "the simulation details can be found in k07 , except that this new run employs a purely solenoidal large - scale driving force .",
    "turbulence statistics derived from these new data with unprecedented dynamic range confirm the convergence of our earlier results obtained with lower resolution .",
    "figure  [ figtwo ] provides a brief summary of the new statistics .",
    "the power spectrum of projected gas density has a slope of @xmath9 in the inertial range , consistent with the 3d density power index of @xmath10 reported in k07 ( fig .",
    "[ figtwo]*a * ) .",
    "the slopes of the power spectra of density and log density ( not shown ) are very close to @xmath11 and to @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "however , it is a mere coincidence that at mach 6 the slopes are represented by these `` good '' numbers , since already at @xmath13 they become shallower .",
    "our new estimate for the `` fractal '' dimension of the density distribution for the inertial range of mach 6 turbulence , @xmath14 , agrees well with the previously obtained value of 2.4 ( fig .",

    "both cases agree nicely with lognormal distributions at high densities and show some divergence at low densities that can be at least partly attributed to poor statistical representation of violently evolving rarefactions due to a limited number of flow snapshots used to derive the pdfs ( 100 for the @xmath0 data and 170 for k07 data ) , cf .",
    "@xcite . finally , fig .",
    "[ figtwo]*d * shows a sample power spectrum of @xmath3 that also confirms the scaling obtained in k07 based on a lower resolution simulations .",
    "we carried out a set of pilot simulations of driven isothermal supersonic turbulence at the sonic mach number of 10 on @xmath1 meshes to demonstrate the performance of our new ppml solver for ideal mhd @xcite .",
    "the models are initiated with a uniform magnetic field aligned with the @xmath16-coordinate direction and cover the transition to turbulence and its evolution for up to 10 dynamical times .",
    "a large - scale ( @xmath17 ) nonhelical solenoidal force is used to stir the gas in the periodic domain which keeps @xmath18 close to 10 during the simulation , see fig .",
    "[ figthree]*a*. the magnetic field is not forced and can receive energy only through interaction with the velocity field . this random",
    "forcing does not generate a mean field , but still leads to amplification of the small - scale magnetic energy via a process known as small - scale dynamo ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is implicitly assumed that the magnetic prandtl number @xmath19 in our numerical models . each simulation reaches a steady state with saturated magnetic energy and a macroscopically statistically isotropic magnetic field , see fig .",
    "[ figthree]*b*. the properties of this saturated state representing fully developed isotropic compressible mhd turbulence is the main focus of this section . while some level of physical understanding of small - scale dynamo and its saturation exists , the structure of the saturated state is poorly known , even in the incompressible case @xcite .",
    "our models are parameterized by the ratios of thermal - to - magnetic pressure @xmath20 .",
    "the initial values @xmath21 and 2 translate into saturated levels of the magnetic energy at about 10% and 30% of the kinetic energy , respectively ( fig .",

    "we computed time - average statistics over at least four dynamical times for the saturated regimes .",
    "the results are discussed below .",

    ", the high - density wing of the pdf preserves its lognormal shape and appears insensitive to the intensity level of magnetic fluctuations within the studied range of @xmath31 .",
    "the density power spectra also show some trends with the magnetic field strength , although they are less pronounced than in the velocity spectra ( see below ) .",
    "for example , the power spectrum of the logarithm of projected gas density scales as @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 at @xmath21 , 2 , and 0.2 , respectively ( see also sec .  2 above ) . the density spectrum for @xmath21 ( nearly nonmagnetized medium ) at @xmath13 scales as @xmath39 ,",
    "i.e. it is shallower than in our nonmagnetized simulations at @xmath4 , where the @xmath40 scaling was recovered .",
    "this result confirms k07 prediction that in the limit @xmath41 the density spectrum is flat , @xmath42 , similar to the white noise spectrum . at a fixed sonic mach number ( @xmath13 ) , as the flow magnetization increases ( @xmath43 drops from 10 to 1 ) , the density spectra tend to flatten , see  fig .",
    "[ figthree]*d*. the same tendency is clear in the power spectra of the logarithm of the density , with the slopes around @xmath44 at @xmath13 .",
    "this is consistent with a slope of @xmath45 we measured at @xmath4 and @xmath46 .",
    "we also observe a significant reduction in the extent of the scaling interval in the @xmath47 spectra as @xmath31 decreases from 20 to 0.2 .",
    "we measured a broad range of the velocity power indices from @xmath48 through @xmath49 depending on the degree of magnetization ( fig .",
    "[ figthree]*e * ) .",
    "as expected , the highly super - alfvnic case @xmath21 is very similar to k07 results for nonmagnetized flows , with a burgers - like scaling of the velocity power spectrum , @xmath50 , and a kolmogorov - like spectrum for the density - weighted velocity , @xmath51 ( fig .",

    "this result suggests that slopes of the velocity power spectra around @xmath57 inferred from the observations of molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may indicate a super - alfvnic nature of the turbulence there , see however a related discussion in @xcite .",
    "there is a set of exact scaling laws for homogeneous and isotropic incompressible mhd turbulence analogous to the 4/5-law of kolmogorov for ordinary turbulence in neutral fluids @xcite .",

    "* k07 ) and the difference of scaling exponents for longitudinal and transverse structure functions can serve as a robust measure of statistical uncertainty of the computed exponents @xcite . in mhd simulations ,",
    "the third - order structure functions of the elssser fields @xmath73 were shown to have an approximately linear scaling too @xcite , but again there is no reason for this result to universally hold in all situations since the correlations between the @xmath74 fields play an important role in nonlinear transfer processes .",
    "can the 4/3-law for incompressible mhd turbulence be extended to highly compressible supersonic regimes in molecular clouds ?",
    "as we discussed above , a proper density weighting of the velocity , @xmath3 , preserves the approximately linear scaling of the third - order structure functions at high mach numbers in the nonmagnetized case ( for a more involved approach to density weighting see * ? ? ?",
    "it is straightforward to redefine the elsasser fields for compressible flows using the 1/3-rule , @xmath75 , so that they match the original @xmath74 fields in the incompressible limit and reduce to @xmath3 in the limit of vanishing @xmath64 .",
    "the new @xmath76 fields can have universal scaling properties in homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows with a broad range of sonic and alfvnic mach numbers .",

    "although the scaling range is rather short in @xmath1 numerical data , each of the three cases clearly demonstrates a linear behavior @xmath83 , in contrast to the corresponding scaling of the velocity or the magnetic energy which strongly depend on @xmath31 , see fig .",
