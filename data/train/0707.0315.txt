    "research on random graphs and hypergraphs has a long history with thousands of papers and two monographs by bollobs @xcite and by janson et al .",
    "@xcite devoted to the subject and its diverse applications . in the classical erds - rnyi model @xcite , a random graph is generated by starting from an empty graph and then adding certain number of random edges .",
    "more recently , bohman , frieze and martin @xcite considered a generalized model where one starts with a fixed graph @xmath5 and then inserts a collection @xmath6 of additional random edges . we denote the resulting random graph by @xmath7 .",
    "the initial graph @xmath8 can be regarded as given by an adversary , while the random perturbation @xmath6 represents noise or uncertainty , independent of the initial choice .",
    "this scenario is analogous to the _ smoothed analysis _ of algorithms proposed by spielman and teng @xcite , where an algorithm is assumed to run on the worst - case input , modified by a small random perturbation .",
    "usually , one investigates _",
    "monotone properties _ of random graphs or hypergraphs ; i.e. , properties which can not be destroyed by adding more edges , like the property of containing a certain fixed subgraph . given a monotone property @xmath9 of graphs on @xmath10 vertices",
    ", we can ask what are the parameters for which a random graph has property @xmath9 almost surely , i.e. with probability tending to @xmath11 as the number of vertices @xmath10 tends to infinity . in our setting , we start with a fixed hypergraph @xmath12 and inquire how many random edges @xmath6 we have to add so that @xmath13 has property @xmath9 almost surely .",
    "this question is too general to get concrete and meaningful results , valid for all hypergraphs @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , rather than considering a completely arbitrary @xmath12 , we start with a hypergraph from a certain natural class .",
    "one such class of graphs was considered in @xcite , where the authors analyze the question of how many random edges need to be added to a graph @xmath8 of minimal degree at least @xmath14 , so that the resulting graph @xmath7 is almost surely hamiltonian .",
    "further properties of random graphs in this model are explored in @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "krivelevich et al . considered a slightly more general setting , in which one performs a small random perturbation of a graph @xmath8 with at least @xmath15 edges .",
    "observe that since @xmath8 has at least @xmath15 edges , removing a small set of random edges would leave the total number of edges in @xmath8 essentially unchanged .",
    "therefore one only has to focus on the case of adding random edges . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors obtained tight results for the appearance of a fixed subgraph and for certain ramsey properties in this model . in the same paper , they also considered random formulas obtained by adding random @xmath1-clauses ( disjunctions of @xmath1 literals ) to a fixed @xmath1-sat formula .",
    "krivelevich et al .",
    "proved that for any formula with at least @xmath16 @xmath1-clauses , adding @xmath17 random clauses of size @xmath1 makes the formula almost surely unsatisfiable .",
    "this is tight , since there is a @xmath1-sat formula with @xmath18 clauses which almost surely remains satisfiable after adding @xmath19 random clauses .",
    "a related question , which was raised in @xcite , is to find a threshold for non-@xmath0-colorability of a random hypergraph obtained by adding random edges to a large hypergraph of a given density .    for an integer @xmath20 , a _",
    "@xmath1-uniform hypergraph _ is an ordered pair @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a finite non - empty set , called set of _ vertices _ and @xmath23 is a family of distinct @xmath1-subsets of @xmath22 , called the _ edges _ of @xmath12 . a _ @xmath0-coloring _ of a hypergraph @xmath12 is a partition of its vertex set @xmath22 into two color classes so that no edge in @xmath23 is monochromatic .",
    "a hypergraph which admits a @xmath0-coloring is called _",
    "@xmath0-colorable_.    @xmath0-colorability is one of the fundamental properties of hypergraphs , which was first introduced and studied by bernstein @xcite in 1908 for infinite hypergraphs .",
    "@xmath0-colorability in the finite setting , also known as  property b \" ( a term coined by erds in reference to bernstein ) , has been studied extensively in the last forty years ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . while @xmath0-colorability of graphs is well understood being equivalent to non - existence of odd cycles , for @xmath1-uniform hypergraphs with @xmath24 it is already @xmath25-complete to decide whether a @xmath0-coloring exists @xcite .",
    "consequently , there is no efficient characterization of @xmath0-colorable hypergraphs .",
    "the problem of @xmath0-colorability of random @xmath1-uniform hypergraphs for @xmath24 was first studied by alon and spencer @xcite .",
    "they proved that such hypergraphs with @xmath26 edges are almost surely @xmath0-colorable .",
    "this bound was improved later by achlioptas et al .",
    "recently , the threshold for @xmath0-colorability has been determined very precisely . in @xcite",
    "it was proved that the number of edges for which a random @xmath1-uniform hypergraph becomes almost surely non-@xmath0-colorable is @xmath27 .",
    "interestingly , the threshold for non-@xmath0-colorability is roughly one half of the threshold for @xmath1-sat .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that a formula with @xmath28 random @xmath1-clauses becomes almost surely unsatisfiable for @xmath29 .",
    "the two problems seem to be intimately related and it is natural to ask what is their relationship in the case of a random perturbation of a fixed instance .",
    "recall that from @xcite we know that for any @xmath1-sat formula with @xmath18 clauses , adding @xmath17 random clauses makes it almost surely unsatisfiable .",
    "in fact , the same proof yields that for any @xmath1-uniform hypergraph @xmath12 with @xmath18 edges , adding @xmath17 random edges destroys @xmath0-colorability almost surely .",
    "nonetheless , it turns out that this is not the right answer .",
    "it is enough to use substantially fewer random edges to destroy @xmath0-colorability : roughly a square root of the number of random clauses necessary to destroy satisfiability .",
    "the following is our main result .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath30 , @xmath31 be fixed and let @xmath12 be a @xmath0-colorable @xmath1-uniform hypergraph with @xmath2 edges .",
    "then the hypergraph @xmath32 obtained by adding to @xmath12 a collection @xmath6 of @xmath33 random @xmath34-tuples is almost surely non-@xmath0-colorable .",
    "observe that for @xmath35 , the result is easy .",
    "regardless of the hypergraph @xmath12 , it is well known that a collection of @xmath36 random @xmath34-tuples on @xmath10 vertices is almost surely non-@xmath0-colorable .",
    "so we will be only interested in the case when @xmath37 .",
    "for such @xmath38 we obtain the following result , which shows that the assertion of theorem [ main ] is essentially best possible .",
    "[ main - construction ] for fixed @xmath30 and @xmath39 , there exists a @xmath0-colorable @xmath1-uniform hypergraph @xmath12 with @xmath2 edges such that its union with a collection @xmath6 of @xmath40 random @xmath34-tuples is almost surely @xmath0-colorable .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present an example of the hypergraph which shows that our main result is essentially best possible . in section 3",
    "we discuss some natural difficulties in proving theorem [ main ] and describe how to deal with them in the case of bipartite graphs .",
    "this result also serves as a basis for induction which we use in section 4 to prove the general case of @xmath0-colorable @xmath1-uniform hypergraphs .",
    "[ equiv - model ] we have two alternative ways of adding random edges .",
    "either we can sample a random @xmath34-tuple @xmath41 times , each time uniformly and independently from the set of all @xmath42 @xmath34-tuples .",
    "or we can pick each @xmath34-tuple randomly and independently with probability @xmath43 . since @xmath0-colorability is a monotone property , it follows , as in bollobs @xcite , theorem 2.2 and a similar remark in @xcite , that if the resulting hypergraph is almost surely non-@xmath0-colorable ( @xmath0-colorable ) in one model then this is true in the other model as well .",

    "we can assume that @xmath6 was obtained by choosing every @xmath34-tuple in @xmath71 $ ] randomly and independently with probability @xmath83 .",

    "finally the probability that there exists a path between two vertices with any prescribed color is also bounded by @xmath110    therefore almost surely no vertex gets prescribed conflicting colors , every connected component of @xmath8 is a tree and contains at most one vertex with prescribed color .",
    "this immediately implies the assertion of the lemma , since every tree can be @xmath0-colored , starting from the vertex with prescribed color ( if any ) . @xmath111",
    "now let s turn to theorem  [ main ] . first , consider the case of @xmath112 . here , we claim that for any bipartite graph @xmath8 with @xmath113 edges , adding @xmath114 random edges makes the graph almost surely non - bipartite .",
    "this will follow quite easily , since it turns out that almost surely we will insert an edge inside one part of a bipartite connected component of @xmath8 , creating an odd cycle ( see the proof of proposition [ bipartite ] ) .    however , with the more general hypergraph case in mind , we are also interested in a scenario where random @xmath34-tuples are added to a bipartite graph , and @xmath115",
    ". then we ask what is the probability that the resulting hypergraph is @xmath0-colorable ( i.e. , no @xmath0-edge and no @xmath34-edge should be monochromatic ) .",

    "this suggests a difficulty with the attempt to place a random @xmath34-tuple in a set which is forced to be monochromatic by the original graph .",
