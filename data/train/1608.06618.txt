    "it is well known that group theoretical properties and number of nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons are determined by a given coset space @xmath1 . if we extend it to a supersymmetric ( susy ) theory , the ng bosons are always accompanied by fermions .",
    "it is extremely interesting to identify the fermions ( called as quasi ng fermions ) with observed quarks and leptons @xcite , since it may provide us not only an origin of families of quarks and leptons but also an answer to the fundamental question why we have three families in nature .    the susy @xmath2 non - linear sigma ( nls ) model based on the coset space @xmath0  @xcite is fascinating , since it can accommodate three families of quarks and sleptons as its ng chiral multiplets .",
    "this suggests that we may predict the maximal number of families in the approach of nls based on exceptional groups , since the exceptional group is limited up to @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , it is shown that number of the families is limited to be three even if we take the biggest exceptional group @xmath3  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the @xmath0 model , where the unbroken @xmath4 is identified with the gauge group of the grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "the masses of the squarks and sleptons are highly suppressed at the tree level , since the global @xmath2 is assumed to be exact in the limit where gauge couplings and yukawa couplings vanish .",
    "their masses are dominantly generated via radiative corrections , leading to a natural solution to the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) problem .",
    "on the other hand , higgs multiplets , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are considered to be non - ng multiplets , and hence , their masses are not suppressed .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine if the above ng boson hypothesis of all the squarks and sleptons is consistent with observations . for this purpose , we choose one of the attractive and consistent mediation scenarios of susy breaking , that is called as pure gravity mediation ( pgm )  @xcite or minimal split susy  @xcite . in the pgm , gaugino masses are generated radiatively at the one - loop level via anomaly mediation  @xcite . since the gravitino mass is larger than @xmath7tev , the cosmological gravitino problem is avoided easily .",
    "the gaugino masses are generated without a gauge singlet susy breaking ( polonyi ) field ; therefore , the cosmological polonyi problem does not exist . even without the gauge singlet susy breaking field , the higgsino mass term of the order of the gravitino mass arises via an @xmath8-symmetry breaking term , i.e. the constant term in the superpotential  @xcite . in the pgm ,",
    "the lightest neutralino is the pure wino of a mass range of @xmath9-@xmath10 gev , providing us with a good dark matter candidate .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that the susy fcnc problem is significantly relaxed .    in this paper , we point out that the @xmath0 nls model is consistent with pure gravity mediation . model . in this case , the higgsino - like neutralino rather than the stau can be the lightest susy particle , reducing the fine - tuning of the electroweak symmetry breaking . ]",
    "the present model can be regarded as an ultraviolet completion of higgs - anomaly mediation proposed in ref .",
    "furthermore , we also show the predicted squark masses of the first and second generations are likely to be smaller than a few tev when the thermal leptogenesis  @xcite ( see also @xcite for reviews ) successfully explains the observed baryon asymmetry",
    ". those squarks can be discovered at the lhc run-2 or at the high luminosity lhc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.2 , we explain our setup , the @xmath2 nls model combined with pgm . it is shown that the ng multiplets of the three chiral generations have vanishing masses at the tree level . in sec.3 , we investigate low - energy phenomenology of the model , paying attention to the the lightest squark and slepton masses .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "the @xmath0 model is obtained via @xmath11 model , which contains @xmath12 ng modes .",
    "the ng multiplets are  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "note that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are identified with chiral multiplets of three family leptons and quarks , whose scalar components are massless at the tree level . here , we assume @xmath18 has a large dirac mass term with another @xmath19 , with one of higgs multiplets , @xmath5 , in this paper . ] which is required to cancel the non - linear sigma model and gauge anomalies  @xcite . the higgs chiral multiplets , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ,",
    "are introduced as non - ng matter multiplets .",
    "then , their boson components are expected to have susy breaking soft masses of the order of the gravitino mass , @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath0 model is obtained through the further breaking @xmath21 down to @xmath22 , leading to six more ng bosons .",
    "these ng bosons are identified with scalar partners of three right - handed neutrinos .",
    "after all , the three new ng chiral multiplets of @xmath23 are identified with three chiral multiplets of the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the k \" ahler potential for the ng multiplets is constructed from a real function transforming under @xmath2 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a holomorphic function of @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is invariant under transformations of the unbroken symmetry , @xmath28 .",
    "the real function @xmath27 itself can not be @xmath2 invariant , since the shift of @xmath27 with the holomorphic function does not leave the lagrangian invariant in supergravity theories : we need an chiral superfield , @xmath29 , to cancel the shift  @xcite .",

    "the soft susy breaking mass of @xmath26 arises from @xmath35 \\frac{|w|^2}{m_p^4 } \\nonumber \\\\   & = & e^{k / m_p^2 }   \\left(\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 k}{\\partial x^2}\\right)^{-1 } \\frac{|w|^2}{m_p^4 } = g(x ) , \\label{eq : gs_mass}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 ; @xmath37 is the superpotential with @xmath38 . here , @xmath39gev is the reduced planck mass .",
    "then , @xmath40 which vanishes at the minimum .",
    "we see all ng bosons are massless at the tree level .",
    "the above argument does not depend on whether there is a direct coupling between a ( pseudo ) ng multiplet and a susy breaking field @xmath41 , since the potential is just replaced as @xmath42 ( see appendix for an explicit calculation ) .    on the other hand , we assume that the soft susy breaking masses for the higgs doublets , which are non - ng multiplets , are given by : @xmath43 at the tree level , where @xmath44 is a constant free parameter .",
    "the negativeness of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is important to solve the tachyonic slepton problem  @xcite and give large masses for stops  @xcite , enhancing the higgs boson mass  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the soft susy breaking masses for ng bosons arise radiatively via anomaly mediation and renormalization group ( rg ) running effects from @xmath45 and @xmath46 . at the high energy scale ,",

    "since there is no polonyi field in our setup , the gaugino masses are purely generated from anomaly mediation : @xmath55 above a susy particle mass scale .",
    "here , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are bino , wino and gluino mass , respectively ; @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are gauge coupling constants of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath61 . below the susy particle mass scale ,",
    "the threshold corrections  @xcite need to be included .",
    "trilinear couplings are also generated from anomaly mediation and given by @xmath62 with @xmath63",
    "we assume , in this subsection , that the gauge and yukawa interactions are only sources of the explicit breaking of the global @xmath2 , and hence all squarks and sleptons are massless at the tree level .",
    "the masses of squark and sleptons arise only through anomaly mediation at the high energy ( gut ) scale .",
    "thus , sleptons are tachyonic at @xmath47 as discussed in the previous section . however , radiative corrections from the higgs loops lift up the slepton mass for @xmath64 , solving the tachyonic slepton problem .",
    "we estimate the positive contributions to sfermion masses from higgs loops by taking into account rg running effects .",
    "the resultant mass spectrum is hierarchical among generations since yukawa couplings of higgs doublets are hierarchical  @xcite , and hence we obtain relatively large masses for stops which explains easily the observed higgs boson mass of @xmath65gev .",
    "since the sleptons and squarks are massless at the tree level , this model has four parameters : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "note that from the conditions of the correct electroweak symmetry breaking , the viable range of @xmath67 is fixed to be @xmath68 ( 60 ) for @xmath69 .",
    "this is because one needs large yukawa couplings of the tau and bottom , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the necessity of the large @xmath67 is explained as follows . from the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) conditions , we have @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a mass of the cp - odd higgs . here , we have used @xmath74 . in order to avoid a tachyonic cp - odd higgs , @xmath75",

    "this is achieved via the rg running of @xmath46 , @xmath77 for large @xmath71 and @xmath70 ( remember that @xmath46 is negative ) . for large @xmath68 ( or 60 for @xmath78 ) , the above contribution is larger than that for @xmath45 , @xmath79 then , @xmath76 ( @xmath80 ) is realized at the low - energy scale , which is required for the correct ewsb .     and @xmath81gev .",

    "the susy spectrum is computed using suspect2.4.3  @xcite .",

    "although we have concentrated on the case that the @xmath8-parity is conserved , one can also consider the small @xmath8-parity violation . in this case , it is easy to imagine that the viable parameter region becomes wider , since the squarks and sleptons can be lighter than the lightest neutralino .",
    "note that the testability of the model is also enhanced : the stable squark can be checked by searching an @xmath8-hadron for heavy gravitino of @xmath143700 tev ; the stable slepton can be as light as @xmath144(100 ) gev even for @xmath20 = 1000 tev .",

    ", the constraints from the electron and neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) are severe . for instance , in the base that the @xmath146-term and gravitino mass are real , the argument of the higgs @xmath147-term needs to be as small as @xmath148-@xmath149 to avoid the constraint from the electron edm  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , remarkable that we need cp violation only in the @xmath2-breaking yukawa couplings , so far .",
    "thus , it is very interesting to consider that violations of two independent symmetries , cp and @xmath2 , arise from an underlying common physics .",
