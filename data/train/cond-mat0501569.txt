    "recently we proposed @xcite to use a lateral interface between two regions of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas with different strengths of the bychkov - rashba @xcite spin - orbit ( so ) interaction as a spin - polarizing element for the purposes of spintronics . dattadas1990,wolf2001",
    "the lateral interface introduces the space - varying so interaction which leads to spin - dependent refraction of spin carriers passing through the interface.@xcite consequently , an electron beam with a nonzero angle of incidence after passing through the interface splits into beams with different spin polarizations propagating in different directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : refraction ] for the scattering at the lateral interface between the regions with and without so interaction ) . using an interface with an inhomogeneous so interaction as a principal element of spin - based devices we outlined the schemes for a spin filter , spin guide , and a spin current switch ( spin transistor ) .",
    "this program promises to build spintronics devices avoiding magnetic materials that are not conventional for the semiconductor industry .",
    "it can be realized in the gated heterostructures with a sufficiently strong bychkov - rashba so interaction @xcite by manipulating the gates . @xcite",
    "the effect of the separation of the trajectories of electrons with different spin polarizations ( chiralities ) influenced by the space - varying so interaction has the same grounds as the double refraction ( birefringence ) of light in uniaxial crystals exploited in optical devices for the polarization of light .",
    "the separation of the trajectories of carriers of different spin has been observed recently@xcite in the case of a homogeneous so interaction as a result of action of a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the separation of the trajectories after reflection at a lateral potential barrier in the presence of the so interaction has been observed in ref .  .",
    "two facts that can be useful for the purposes of the spintronics have been found in ref .   in the analysis of the spin - dependent scattering of electrons incident on a lateral interface with a so interaction varying in the direction normal to the interface .",
    "first , there exists an interval of outgoing angles @xmath0 where only electrons with a definite spin chirality can penetrate ( see fig .",
    "fig : refraction ) .",
    "if it is possible to collect electrons from this interval , one will have an ideal spin filter .",
    "second , electrons of this chirality exhibit a total internal reflection for an angle of incidence in an interval @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a critical angle of the total internal reflection .",
    "it is clear from these observations that the electrons propagating at small angles to the lateral interface are most sensitive to the variation of the magnitude of the spin - orbit interaction , and therefore such electrons are most appropriate for spin control and manipulation .",
    "hence one has to find a way to create ( and collect ) flows of electrons of high intensity that are almost tangential to the interface . in this paper",
    "we suggest using the diffuse emission@xcite as a possible solution of this task .",
    "we show that making one of the two regions connected by the lateral interface to be diffusive is an effective way to achieve a flat angular distribution of particles emitted from the diffusive region into the clean one .",
    "the effect of flattening of the angular distribution of the emitted electrons is the robust property of the diffuse emission which holds despite the presence of a spin - dependent reflection at the interface . due to the flatness of the angular distribution a substantial portion of electrons",
    "propagates at small angles to the interface and these electrons are suitable for the spin filtration and subsequent spin manipulation . in fig .",
    "fig : diffuse - filter a scheme of a device is presented which operates as a spin filter with a high level of spin - polarization of a filtered current .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : spinorbit ] we present the results@xcite of the analysis of scattering of electrons at the lateral interface between the two regions with different magnitudes of the bychkov - rashba term . in section [ sec : kinetics ] we analyze the transport of the 2d electrons in the presence of the coulomb interaction near the interface between the diffusive and ballistic regions . in section sec : milne we reconsider the problem of the diffuse emission ( milne problem@xcite ) for an arbitrary dimension . in section [ sec : spindependentemission ]",
    "we generalize the technique developed for the problem of the diffuse emission to the case of the spin - dependent scattering at the lateral interface .",
    "we use a semiclassical approach with electrons moving along the classically allowed trajectories when the spin of electrons is the only element treated quantum - mechanically . for this purpose",
    ", we analyze the transport near the interface in terms of the spin density matrix . in the summary a scheme of a spin filter device that creates two beams of electrons of a very high level of spin polarization is presented .",
    "consider a two - dimensional electron gas confined in the @xmath3 plane by a potential well in the semiconductor heterostructure .",
    "generally , the potential well has the shape of an asymmetric triangle , and , consequently , there is a direction of asymmetry , @xmath4 , perpendicular to the electron gas plane .",
    "this leads to the appearance of the specific spin - orbit interaction term@xcite in the hamiltonian , @xmath5 . we will consider the case when the parameter @xmath6 varies along the @xmath7 direction .",
    "the direction of @xmath4 is chosen as @xmath8 generally , the hamiltonian has the form : @xmath9 .",
    "\\label{eq : hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 describes the varying bottom of the conduction band which may be controlled by gates .",
    "the current operator corresponding to this hamiltonian contains a spin term : @xmath11 the presence of spin in the current operator implies that in the process of scattering at the lateral interface with varying @xmath6 the continuity conditions for the wave function involves the spin degrees of freedom of the electrons .",
    "this makes the electron scattering at the interface to be spin - dependent .    to diagonalize the hamiltonian with the bychkov - rashba term in the regions of constant @xmath6 one has to choose the axis of the spin quantization along the direction @xmath12 .",
    "then for the two chiralities ( referred to below as @xmath13 and @xmath14 modes ) the dispersion relations are given by @xmath15correspondingly , the momenta of the waves of a given energy @xmath16 involved in the scattering at the interface between the two regions with different @xmath17 are determined as follows : @xmath18here @xmath19 and we introduce a small dimensionless parameter @xmath20 which we will use throughout the paper .",
    "notice that at a given energy the velocity of electrons of both chiralities is the same : @xmath21 .",
    "let us discuss the kinematical aspects of the electron scattering at the lateral interface .",
    "an incident ( nonpolarized ) beam comes at angle @xmath22 from the region without a spin - orbit term ( or with a suppressed spin - orbit term ) , denoted as the n region , and when transmitted into the so region splits into two beams of different chirality that propagate at different angles @xmath23 .",

    "splits after the refraction into two beams with @xmath13 and @xmath29 chiralities that propagate at angles @xmath30 ( denoted by red and blue colors , respectively ) .",
    "( a ) @xmath31 determines the limited aperture for @xmath14 chirality ; in the angle interval @xmath32 only electrons of @xmath33 chirality can penetrate .",
    "( b ) @xmath34 is an angle for total internal reflection for electrons of the @xmath33 chirality.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ppm ] ) and ( [ eq : snell ] ) it follows that the so region is more `` optically '' dense for the @xmath33 mode ( i.e. , it has a smaller wave vector ) and less dense for the @xmath35 mode .",
    "correspondingly , the @xmath33 mode is refracted to larger angles than the @xmath35 one , and therefore the @xmath33 mode exhibits a total internal reflection with a critical angle @xmath36 . as to the @xmath35 mode it has a limited aperture in the so region for outgoing angles : @xmath37    remarkably , the angle interval where only the @xmath33 mode can penetrate is not narrow as its width has a square root dependence on @xmath38 .",
    "it follows from snell s law that @xmath39 .",
    "actually , one can reduce @xmath40 even further . with the gates acting selectively on the different regions of the electron gas , @xmath41",
    ", one can alter the position of the bands relative to the fermi level in the n and so regions .",
    "a simple analysis shows that with an increase of @xmath42 ( i.e. , lowering @xmath43 in the normal region ) the angle interval @xmath44 grows and reaches @xmath45 .",
    "starting from this moment the angle interval suitable for spin filtration narrows and eventually becomes @xmath46 , instead of @xmath47    the problem of scattering of electrons at a lateral interface between the two regions with different magnitudes of the bychkov - rashba term has been considered in ref .   for the two limiting cases of a sharp , @xmath48 and smooth , @xmath49 interface , where @xmath50 is an electron wavelength and @xmath51 is an effective width of the interface . here",
    "a qualitative description of the analysis of the spin - dependent scattering at the interface will be presented only .",
    "a scattering state of an electron coming from the n region in the state @xmath52 is given by    @xmath53    where @xmath54 are spinors corresponding to the @xmath55 chiral modes in the @xmath27 and @xmath56 regions , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the amplitudes of the reflected and the transmitted waves . in eq .",
    "( eq : scattering_state ) the interface is at @xmath59 and for simplicity we limit ourselves to the case of the interface between the n and so regions .",
    "a similar expression holds also for @xmath60 which evolves from the incident state @xmath61    the flux of particles impinging on the interface at a given angle @xmath62 can be defined as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the cross - sectional area ( width ) of a beam .",
    "the intensity @xmath65of the transmitted flux of a given chirality can be found from the relation @xmath66 here the cosine factors take into consideration the change of the cross - sectional width of the beam as a result of the scattering , while @xmath67 ( we use the fact that for the two chiralities the velocities are the same ) . finally , the intensity of the refracted flux relative to the incident one is equal to    @xmath68    for a sharp interface the amplitudes @xmath69 can be found from the continuity conditions , while for a smooth interface one can conduct the analysis of the refraction using a small parameter @xmath70 . in the latter case the electron spin adjusts itself adiabatically to the momentum keeping its polarization in the direction perpendicular to the momentum .     and @xmath71 per unit angle as a function of an angle of incidence for sharp ( solid line ) and smooth ( dashed line ) interfaces ( ref . )",
    ".,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    it has been shown in ref .   that in the course of refraction at the interface with @xmath72 transitions between states of different chirality are strongly suppressed .",
    "for that reason , the drop of the intensities of the transmitted electrons without change of their chirality @xmath73 and @xmath74 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity ] , occurs practically only due to the reflection which becomes decisive only for @xmath75 . in particular",
    ", for a smooth interface the probability of the reflection outside the region of the total internal reflection is almost entirely suppressed because the matrix elements describing reflection are integrals of the rapidly oscillating functions .",
    "consequently , the transmission amplitudes presented in fig .",
    "fig : intensity have almost rectangular shape for a smooth interface .    summarizing the results obtained in ref .   for",
    "the cases of the sharp and smooth interface one can state that for both the discussed cases an electron in a state of a definite chirality propagates along the classically allowed trajectory for this chirality , while a change of the chirality is very ineffective .",
    "the case of the n - so interface described so far was taken mostly for illustration .",
    "actually , any interface with a change of @xmath6 results in splitting of the trajectories that can be used for the purposes of spin polarization and filtration . in the analysis above , one should replace @xmath76 by the difference of the strength of the spin - orbit interaction @xmath77 across the interface .",
    "in this section we discuss the kinetics of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas near the boundary between the diffusive and ballistic regions .",
    "we show that within the linear response approximation the equation determining the current distribution function and the equation determining the density and potential profiles are decoupled , except for boundary conditions .",
    "this analysis justifies the concept introduced by landauer:@xcite to determine the transport properties it is enough to consider noninteracting quasiparticles that propagate without interaction , i.e. , ignoring any effects related to the redistribution of the potential due to the coulomb interaction of electrons .",
    "the problem requires , however , fixing up the boundary conditions , which we perform below for a particular geometry .",
    "the kinetic equation describing a stationary flow of electrons by a distribution function @xmath78 is @xmath79 the electron flow is forced by the electric field , @xmath80 .",
    "correspondingly , eq .  ( [ eq : kinetic:1 ] ) should be supplied by the poisson equation which when limited to the 2d plane is @xmath81 here the laplacian acts in 3d space , while @xmath82 is the deviation of density of the 2d electron gas from the equilibrium value .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson ] ) should be supplemented with the 3d conditions on @xmath83 that will take care of the 3d environment of the 2d electron gas .",
    "this introduces an element of nonuniversality into this problem .",
    "fortunately , in the linear response approximation the situation is much more tractable and the problem of the current flow of the 2d gas becomes self - contained ( see , e.g. ,  ref .  ) .    in the linear response approximation one keeps terms linear in @xmath84 and @xmath85 only : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the fermi - dirac equilibrium distribution .",
    "( we assume throughout the paper that the spatial variation of the fermi - energy level as well as other parameters of the electron liquid such as the density of states and the screening length occurs on distances greatly exceeding the wavelength and the mean free path .",
    "for that reason , the spatial variation of the parameters characterizing the electron liquid is ignored below . ) in the presence of the electron - electron interaction there is an additional force that originates from the interaction of the quasiparticles .",
    "this effect has been accounted for by a substitution of the local equilibrium distribution @xmath89 in place of @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : linearized ] ) , see ref .  .",
