    "projective reed  muller ( prm ) codes have been investigated extensively since they were first introduced by lachaud @xcite in 1988 .",
    "srensen @xcite determined the minimum distances of prm codes and proved that the dual code of a prm code is also a prm code or is spanned by a prm code and a vector of ones .",
    "in addition , berger and maximy @xcite presented conditions under which prm codes are cyclic or quasi - cyclic .",
    "recently , ballet and rolland @xcite examined low - weight codewords of prm codes and obtained an estimation of the second weight .",
    "the prm codes of one - dimensional projective spaces are also considered to be doubly extended reed  solomon codes .",
    "decoding examples for prm codes related to low dimensional projective spaces are presented in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    to realize practical communication channels , many researchers constructed decoding procedures whose computational complexities are polynomial time .",
    "in addition , they investigated the numbers of errors correctable and the codeword error rates . although the minimum distance decoding ( mdd ) @xcite , @xcite achieves a good codeword error rate , the computational complexity of the mdd based on generating all codewords is known to be exponential .",
    "pellikaan @xcite developed a decoding algorithm for linear codes , which corrects @xmath1-errors if there exist @xmath1-error correcting pairs .",
    "the computational complexity of this algorithm is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the code length .",
    "the feng  rao decoding algorithm @xcite , @xcite is also shown as a decoding method of @xmath2 for linear codes . the number of errors correctable by the feng  rao algorithm is determined by feng ",
    "rao bounds @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is possible that these two algorithms can be applied to prm codes .",
    "however , we can not find any observations of @xmath1-error correcting pairs and feng  rao bounds for prm codes , and it is difficult to determine the numbers of errors correctable .",
    "the objective of the present study is to investigate a decoding algorithm for all prm codes such that its computational complexity is less than @xmath2 and the number of errors correctable is determined .",
    "we construct a new decoding algorithm by dividing a projective space into a union of affine spaces that a decoding algorithm proposed the second author @xcite is applied for each affine component . in our algorithm , we adopt the berlekamp  massey",
    " sakata ( bms ) algorithm @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to obtain a grbner basis whose zeros are the error positions , and we use the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) to determine the error values .",
    "after that , we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is strictly less than @xmath2 . in particular , the complexity of the error position determination is @xmath4 and that of the error value determination is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the maximum of the cardinalities of grbner bases obtained by bms algorithm for all components and @xmath7 is the finite field cardinality .",
    "we have @xmath8 .",
    "next , we determine the number of errors correctable by our algorithm component - wise .",
    "this implies the number of errors correctable at arbitrary positions .",
    "finally , we compare the codeword error rate of our algorithm with that of the mdd and find them to be similar for some high - order prm codes .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - preliminaries ] , we present some preliminary notation and recall the results of a previous study @xcite .",

    "we define @xmath11 where @xmath12 is called an @xmath10-dimensional affine space over @xmath9 .",

    "let @xmath35 denote the @xmath9-linear space indexed by @xmath34 .",
    "for a subset @xmath36 of @xmath37 , we denote the dual @xmath38 of @xmath36 by @xmath39 the following is widely known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "a projective space is identified by a union of affine spaces , i.e. , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a subset of @xmath62 for all @xmath63 by which an @xmath64-dimensional affine space is identified .",

    "* remark 3 ) ) .",
    "therefore , in the rest of this paper , we assume that @xmath70 .",
    "it is shown ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that @xmath71 is an @xmath72-code with @xmath73 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are determined by @xmath74 , @xmath32 , and @xmath75 .",

    "in this paper , we have constructed a decoding algorithm for all prm codes by dividing a projective space into a union of affine spaces .",
    "we have determined the number of errors correctable for @xmath71 . although it is the same as the number of errors correctable for @xmath26 , advantages of algorithm [ decodingprm ] are that the codeword is longer and the code parameters are more flexible .",
    "we have also proved that the computational complexities of algorithm [ decodingprm ] is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is less than @xmath85 .",
    "finally , we compared the codeword error rate of three types of decoding procedures . when the order of a prm code is sufficiently high , the codeword error rate of algorithm [ decodingprm ] is close to that of the mdd .",
    "further improvement of our algorithm is required to decrease the difference between its codeword error rate and that of the mdd .",
