    "the study of phase diagrams of ionic systems in which the phase separation is mainly driven by electrostatic forces is of great fundamental interest and practical importance .",
    "electrolyte solutions , molten salts , ionic liquids and charge - colloidal suspensions are examples of systems with dominant coulomb interactions .",
    "the strong correlations between ions and counter - ions are also known to play an important role in determining structure and phase behavior of micelles , polyelectrolytes and proteins . over the last few decades ,",
    "the phase behavior of ionic fluids has been the subject of many experimental , theoretical and simulation studies and the reviews of the state of the art in this field are available in refs .",
    ". a great deal of the research has been focused on the fluid - fluid phase separation , whereas the fluid - solid phase transition has received less attention so far .    on the other hand , recent experimental , simulation and theoretical studies of room temperature ionic liquids ( rtils ) @xcite , charged globular proteins  @xcite or colloidal particles @xcite reveal structural inhomogeneities of different type and spatial extent , and it becomes evident that the ordering in systems dominated by coulomb interactions has a very rich and complex nature , and is far from being understood .",
    "consequently , ordering of ions or charged particles on different length scales attracts increasing attention .    the much studied simple salts or electrolytes are quite well understood .",
    "in these systems , the sizes of ions are similar . therefore , theoretical studies focused mainly on the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) where ions of the same valence are modeled by charged hard spheres of the same diameter immersed in a structureless dielectric continuum . at large enough volume fractions ,",
    "transition to an ionic crystal occurs in molten salts when temperature decreases  @xcite . in the ionic",
    "crystal the charge is periodically ordered and this ordering is subjected to the charge neutrality . on the other hand ,",
    "charge - ordered , neutral living clusters of various sizes and life times were found in simulation studies of the fluid phase @xcite .",
    "a direct inspection of the structure in ionic systems is complicated due to a small size of the ions . however , in compliance with the law of corresponding states one my expect a similar behavior in oppositely charged colloidal particles of similar sizes under appropriate rescaling of the length and energy units .",
    "the natural length scale is the sum of radii of the anion and the cation , @xmath1 , while the energy unit is the coulomb potential between the oppositely charged ions at contact , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the charge of the @xmath4-type ion ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 is the dielectric constant of the solvent .",
    "if the non - coulomb interactions are negligible , the phase diagrams of systems consisting of spherical ions of various sizes should have the same form in terms of the volume fraction and a reduced temperature @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , simulations show that the phase diagram of charged particles with similar sizes in deionized solvent ( large debye screening length ) resembles the phase diagram of the rpm  @xcite . in",
    "the above reduced units , the room temperature is very low for simple salts , whereas for colloidal particles it is high .",
    "ordering of colloids at room temperature is directly accessible to observations and vacancies in the crystal can be seen  @xcite .",
    "formation of neutral aggregates in the rpm agrees with recent experimental studies of oppositely charged proteins of similar sizes @xcite .",
    "the aggregation was entirely suppressed when the electrostatic interactions had been screened by addition of a sufficient amount of salt .",
    "thus , the electrostatic interaction is essential at least for the first step of the self - assembly of oppositely charged globular proteins into aggregates .",
    "large spherical aggregates presumably indicate nucleation of a crystal .",
    "rtils differ from simple salts mainly because the sum of radii of the ions is much larger .",
    "this reduces the strength of the coulomb interactions at ion contact and , in turn , increases the room temperature in the reduced units .",
    "in addition , in many rtils the size and shape of the anion can be quite different from the size and shape of the cation . moreover , non",
    "- coulomb interactions may play an important role here .",
    "in such a case the rpm is an oversimplification , and the above discussion does not apply to the rtils .",
    "recent experimental and simulation studies on a series of imidazolium - based rtils indicate spatial inhomogeneities on the length scale @xmath8  nm @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneous structure of liquid resembles the structure of the crystal  @xcite .",
    "the origin of such nanoheterogeneity has not been convincingly explained yet , and new studies are required .    in a mixture of positively and negatively charged globular proteins ,",
    "the size difference between the positively and negatively charged molecules can be similar to the size difference between the anion and the cation in the rtils .",
    "recent experimental studies show that the size difference plays an important role for the assembly of proteins into aggregates . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , formation of spherical aggregates of oppositely charged proteins with overall charge near zero requires charge- and size compensation .",
    "the size difference between charged globular proteins and counterions in a solution is much larger than in the previously described cases .",
    "for example , the diameter of a lysozyme molecule is of order of @xmath9  nm , i.e. , it is 10 times larger than the counterions in an aqueous solution .",
    "the charge of small globular proteins is of order of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the elementary charge . scattering experiments  @xcite",
    "suggest clustering of protein molecules in water .",
    "effective interactions between the lysozyme molecules were shown to have a form of short - range attraction and long - range repulsion  the latter resulting from the charges on the molecules @xcite .",
    "the effective attraction between two molecules is caused by the interactions between them and the counterions attracted to both molecules , as well as by the non - coulomb forces .",
    "simulations carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite for the potential derived in ref .",
    "@xcite show that the fraction of clustered molecules and the shape of clusters strongly depend on the lysozyme volume fraction .",
    "charged nanoparticles or colloidal particles with a diameter @xmath12  nm are several orders of magnitude larger than the microscopic counterions in a solution , and their charge can be orders of magnitude larger than the charge of the counterion . in these systems",
    ", the experiments indicate the formation of colloidal crystals with large interparticle distance for small volume fractions , and a re - entrant melting for larger volume fractions  @xcite .    from the above description of different experimental systems it follows that spatial inhomogeneities are common , but their extent and nature still need to be comprehended and classified for different sizes and charges of the anion and the cation . in the first step , it is essential to predict the structure formation and phase diagram for various size and charge ratios for a generic model where non - coulomb interactions , deviations from a spherical shape and flexibility of molecules are neglected .",
    "the role of the above factors can be determined after comparing the results obtained within a generic model with the experiments .    the generic model that allows one to predict the phase separation driven exclusively by coulomb forces is a primitive model ( pm ) .",
    "in this model , the ionic fluid is described as an electroneutral mixture of charged hard spheres immersed in a structureless dielectric continuum .",
    "the pm pair potential for two ions @xmath4 and @xmath13 at distance @xmath14 apart is @xmath15 where an ion of species @xmath4 has a diameter @xmath16 , and charge @xmath3 , @xmath17 and @xmath6 is the dielectric constant .",
    "the pm is the simplest model for all the above discussed systems .",
    "the two - component pm can be characterized by the parameters of size and charge asymmetry : @xmath18 for @xmath19 one arrives at the rpm .    in the pm with large difference in the ion radii",
    ", the spatial distribution of the ions is expected to be quite different from the rpm , because the tendency for minimizing the electrostatic energy competes with the geometrical restriction on packing of spheres with different sizes @xcite .",
    "packing of large and small spheres that maximizes the entropy could lead to the formation of mesoscopic charged regions , and , on the other hand , when the electrostatic energy is minimized , periodic pattern involving voids could be formed . as a result of the competition between maximizing entropy and minimizing energy , both the charge and the number - density of ions",
    "can oscillate in space .",
    "the systematic studies of the effects of size and charge asymmetry on the periodic ordering in pms were initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite within the framework of the field theoretical description . based on a mean - field stability analysis , the authors found the boundaries of stability of the disordered phase for the whole range of @xmath0 and @xmath20 .",
    "it was shown that , besides a gas - liquid separation , in a certain portion of the phase diagram , the uniform fluid became unstable with respect to the order parameter oscillations of wavelengths @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "the line in the phase diagram corresponding to the instability of the disordered phase with respect to periodic ordering is called the @xmath0-line  @xcite to distinguish it from the spinodal line for which @xmath23 .",
    "the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite show that ( i ) the periodic ordering mainly depends on the size asymmetry ; ( ii ) the qualitative dependence on the charge asymmetry is found only for a sufficiently large size asymmetry .    in this paper",
    "we continue the systematic study of the periodic ordering in asymmetric pms .",
    "we extend the previous study in several ways .",
    "the first modification concerns an approximate description of the reference hard - sphere mixture . in ref .",
    "@xcite a local - density approximation is employed for a hard - sphere free energy functional . here",
    ", we consider a non - local approximation for the reference hard - sphere fluid which is shown to lead to the percus - yevick ( py ) theory for the uniform case @xcite . in our calculations",
    "we use the lebowitz s solution of the generalized py equation @xcite .",
    "another modification concerns the regularization of the coulomb potential inside the hard core .",
    "it is worth noting that in the treatments of models with hard cores , the perturbation potential is not defined uniquely inside the hard core .",
    "here we use the weeks - chandler - andersen ( wca ) regularization scheme for the coulomb potentials @xmath24 @xcite @xmath25 instead of @xmath26 adopted in @xcite . as was shown in ref .",

    "( [ wca ] ) produces rapid convergence of the series of the perturbation theory for the free energy . on the other hand , the best theoretical estimates for the gas - liquid critical point of the rpm",
    "was obtained using the wca regularization scheme @xcite .",
    "finally , we extend the study of the relevant order parameter ( op ) undertaken in @xcite . following the ideas of refs .",
    "@xcite , we determine the op connected with the phase transition to an ordered phase and analyze the character of the dominant fluctuations along the @xmath0-lines associated with the periodic ordering .    a theoretical background for this study is the statistical field theory that exploits the method of collective variables ( cvs ) @xcite .",
    "the theory enables us to derive an exact expression for the functional of grand partition function ( gpf ) of the model and on this basis to develop the perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "as was shown in ref.@xcite , the well - known approximations for the free energy , in particular debye - hckel limiting law and the mean spherical approximation , can be reproduced within the framework of this theory .",
    "links between this approach and the field theoretical approach @xcite were established in @xcite for the case of the rpm .",

    "remarkably , the qualitative dependence on the charge asymmetry appears already in the first regime : for a small charge asymmetry , the @xmath0-lines @xmath67 versus @xmath151 demonstrate the departure from the monotonously increasing behaviour which becomes more evident with an increase of @xmath0 .",
    "this change in the phase diagram is directly related to the non - local approximation used for the reference hard - sphere system . unlike ref .",

    "thus , we can state that the modifications introduced in this paper have led to quantitative and partly qualitative changes in the phase diagram obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite    we conclude that both the size and charge asymmetry affect the periodic ordering in the systems with dominant coulomb interactions , namely : ( 1 ) for @xmath278 , the charge density oscillations dominate in the op  the phase transition to an ionic crystal with a compact unit cell is expected ; ( 2 ) for @xmath298 , both the charge density and the total number density oscillate along the structural line and their contributions to the op depend on @xmath0 and @xmath20 ; ( 3 ) for a moderate and large @xmath0 , a crystalline phase can be stable for intermediate volume fractions and re - entrant melting occurs at high volume fractions , the large nearly neutral clusters may be formed at small volume fractions ; ( 4 ) for a large @xmath0 and small @xmath20 , the fluid - crystal phase transition can be preempted by the gas - liquid - like phase separations ; ( 5 ) for a very large @xmath0 and @xmath20 , the colloidal crystal with periodic distribution of particles surrounded by a cloud of counterions is expected for very small volume fractions and a re - entrant melting for the higher volume fractions .",
