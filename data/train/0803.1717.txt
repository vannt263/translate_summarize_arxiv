    "tensor models ( or generalized matrix models ) @xcite-@xcite were originally considered as the generalization of the matrix models , which describe the two - dimensional simplicial quantum gravity , to higher - dimensional cases . as in the matrix models ,",
    "partition functions are given by a certain summation over simplicial manifolds , which are dual to the feynman diagrams .",
    "although the matrix models have successfully been analyzed extensively by powerful analytical methods , no analytical methods for tensor models are presently known .",
    "moreover , partition functions of tensor models lack physical interpretations such as the topological sum over surfaces realized by the @xmath0-expansion in the matrix models .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a new interpretation of rank - three tensor models was proposed .",
    "this proposal is based on the facts that a fuzzy space is defined by an algebra of functions , and that an algebra can be characterized by a rank - three tensor that defines multiplication , @xmath1 . in this new interpretation that a rank - three tensor may be regarded as the structure constant of an algebra defining a fuzzy space , rank - three tensor models can be regarded as dynamical theories of fuzzy spaces .",
    "this reinterpretation of the models is not just a formal difference , but provides a new practical way of extracting physics from tensor models .",
    "namely , this new interpretation makes it meaningful to treat the models semiclassically , in which classical solutions of the models can be regarded as background fuzzy spaces , and small fluctuations around solutions as field fluctuations in fuzzy spaces .",
    "another important difference from the original proposal @xcite-@xcite is that three is enough as the rank of the tensor for describing a fuzzy space of any dimensions .",
    "this property simplifies the structures of tensor models , since various dimensional cases can be considered in one form .",
    "the rank - three tensor models have mainly been analyzed by numerical means by the present author , and several interesting results have been obtained @xcite . in particular , in the models that have a certain gaussian type of classical solutions corresponding to fuzzy flat spaces of arbitrary dimensions , it has numerically been shown that the properties of low - lying low - momentum small fluctuation modes around the gaussian solutions are in good agreement with the general relativity in the one- , two- , three- and four - dimensional cases @xcite .",
    "in other words , general relativity was found to emerge in these models as an effective low - momentum description .",
    "however , in the three- and four - dimensional cases , owing to the heavy computational requirement , the agreement has been shown only for the numbers of the modes .",
    "to conclude the agreement , the main purpose of this paper is to carry out more detailed numerical analysis of the fluctuation modes in these dimensional cases by applying an approximate method similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite to the analysis of the tensor model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is much simpler than that analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", the simpler model is reviewed . in ",
    "[ sec : prediction ] , by generalizing the discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite to other dimensions , the metric fluctuation modes in general relativity are studied . in ",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , the results of numerical analysis for the two- , three- and four - dimensional fuzzy tori are shown and compared with general relativity . the final section is devoted to the conclusion and future problems .",
    "the tensor model that will be studied in this paper was introduced in my previous paper @xcite .",
    "i summarize the main points below .",
    "the dynamical variable is a totally symmetric rank - three real tensor : @xmath2 there is also a _ nondynamical _ symmetric rank - two real tensor : @xmath3 which is basically taken to be @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 for continuous indices ) .",
    "an action is assumed to have invariance under the orthogonal transformation @xmath6 as @xmath7 this invariance can be achieved by contracting the upper and lower indices in pair , e.g. , @xmath8 . in some places ,",
    "i will use @xmath9 to raise ( lower ) the indices of tensors .",
    "the index of the tensors is the label of functions in a fuzzy space .",
    "it may take values in an infinite set or it may even become a continuous variable in describing fuzzy spaces with an infinite number of functions such as a fuzzy infinite flat plane , or may take values in a finite set for a compact fuzzy space",
    ". the former case will appear below in defining a tensor model which possesses strictly gaussian solutions .",
    "the latter case will appear in ",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , where approximate gaussian solutions corresponding to fuzzy flat tori are considered .",
    "the former case may be considered as an infinite limit of the latter case .    at present",
    ", there are no principles for specifying an action . as an interesting case",
    ", i consider an action that has the gaussian - type solutions @xmath10,\\\\ g^{x_1x_2}&=\\delta^d(x_1-x_2 ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are positive numerical constants , @xmath13 are @xmath14-dimensional continuous coordinates , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the summation in the contraction of pairwise indices is defined as @xmath17 .",
    "the algebra of functions @xmath18 defines a commutative nonassociative fuzzy flat space considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the momentum basis , which is obtained by applying fourier transforms to the indices , the solutions have the form @xmath19 , \\\\",
    "g^{p_1p_2}&=\\delta^d(p_1+p_2),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are positive numerical constants .",
    "the summation in the contraction of pairwise indices is defined as @xmath22 .",
    "the main reason for considering such solutions is the ( partial ) computability due to the gaussian forms .",
    "another reason is that the fuzzy spaces are physically well - behaved in the senses that their fuzziness is well localized and that they have the poincare symmetry .",
    "moreover , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and as will be reviewed in the next section , one can consider a natural correspondence between metric fluctuations in general relativity and fluctuations in tensor models around the gaussian solutions",
    ".    there exist infinitely many actions that have the gaussian solutions .",
    "an example was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the counting of low - lying low - momentum modes showed agreement with general relativity in the one- , two- , three- and four - dimensional cases .",
    "a much simpler action was considered in ref .",
    "this action contains a fractional power and can not be considered to be well defined for arbitrary values of the tensors .",
    "however , at least for the small fluctuations around the gaussian solutions , the action is well - defined and the properties of low - lying low - momentum modes showed clear agreement with general relativity in the two - dimensional case . in this paper ,",
    "the analysis will be carried out for the much simpler action , @xmath23 where @xmath24 when @xmath20 satisfies @xmath25 the gaussian solutions satisfy @xmath26 and become the classical solutions to the equation of motion from the action .",
    "the strategy for comparing the tensor models with general relativity basically follows the procedure carried out for the two - dimensional case in my previous paper @xcite . generalizing the gaussian solutions in an invariant manner ,",
    "the fluctuations of metric tensor in general relativity and those of the tensor in tensor models are assumed to be related by of tensor models should not be confused with the metric tensor @xmath27 . ]",
    "@xmath28,\\\\ g^{x_1x_2}&=\\delta^d(x_1-x_2 ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 denotes the distance between two points , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "although it is possible to directly compare by the correspondence , which should give the same final results , the actual comparison will be carried out in terms of the tensor @xmath33 defined in for technical simplicity , as in ref .",
    "@xcite . in tensor models , a small fluctuation ,",
    "@xmath34 , around a classical solution , @xmath35 , induces a fluctuation of @xmath33 expressed as @xmath36 on the other hand , the correspondence induces @xcite @xmath37 where the momentum basis is used , and @xmath38 is the fourier transform of @xmath39 , which is the metric fluctuation around a flat background .",
    "equations and make it possible to compare the two distinct types of fluctuation , @xmath34 in tensor models and @xmath39 in general relativity",
    ".    in general relativity , not all of the components of @xmath27 are real geometric degrees of freedom on account of the gauge symmetry of local translations .",
    "as will be explained in the following section , the gauge symmetries in the tensor models appear as modes with vanishing spectra , and the modes to be compared are orthogonal to these gauge modes in the sense of the metric @xmath40 which is invariant under the orthogonal transformation .",
    "as reported in my previous paper @xcite , by putting the correspondence into , one obtains the dewitt supermetric @xcite , @xmath41.\\ ] ] consequently , the metric fluctuation modes to be compared must be orthogonal to the local translational symmetry in the sense of the supermetric .    in the following numerical analysis , @xmath14-dimensional fuzzy flat tori will be considered .",
    "therefore , i will discuss below the orthogonal fluctuation modes in general relativity in the backgrounds of @xmath14-dimensional flat tori with metric @xmath42 .",
    "with such a background , the supermetric is explicitly given by @xmath43.\\ ] ] the infinitesimal gauge transformation in the flat background is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the local translation vector , or @xmath46 in the momentum basis .",
    "as can be seen in , at the vanishing momentum sector @xmath47 , the gauge symmetry is null , and all the components of the metric tensor are real geometric degrees of freedom . diagonalizing the supermetric ,",
    "the modes are classified into three orthogonal classes : @xmath48    at the nonvanishing momentum sector , one may take the momentum to be in the direction @xmath49 with evident generalization to the other directions .",
    "then the explicit form of the infinitesimal gauge transformation is given by @xmath50 in the same manner , the modes orthogonal to the gauge modes in the sense of the supermetric are classified into three orthogonal classes : @xmath51",
    "i will first review the general strategy for obtaining the quadratic potential for small fluctuations in tensor models , which was carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the components of @xmath52 in the tensor models are subject to the symmetry constraint .",
    "the independent normalized fluctuation components are obtained from the metric as @xmath53\\ ,   \\delta c_{abc}\\delta c^{abc}=\\sum_{(a , b , c ) } \\delta \\tilde c_{(a , b , c ) } \\delta \\tilde c^{(a , b , c)},\\ ] ] where @xmath54 denotes an order - independent set of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ; @xmath57 are the normalized independent components defined by @xmath58}\\,c_{abc}$ ] ; and @xmath59 $ ] is the multiplicity defined by @xmath60=\\left\\ { \\begin{array}{cl } 1 & a = b = c , \\\\",

    "these are the simplest fuzzy spaces with a finite number of functions on it and are suited for numerical and analytical analyses . because of the translational invariance of the backgrounds , it is convenient to take momentum bases , where an index is assumed to take discrete values in a finite range as @xmath62    the gaussian solutions with evident replacement of the @xmath63-function with a kronecker delta will be the solutions to the action in the limit @xmath64 with @xmath65 , since the effects caused by the finiteness and discreteness of momenta will vanish in this limit . ]",
    "in fact , in my previous paper @xcite , correct numerical solutions similar to the gaussian solutions were explicitly found for the action with such discrete and finite momentum indices in the two - dimensional case .",
    "therefore , it can be expected that the coefficient matrix with will give a good approximation for @xmath14-dimensional fuzzy flat tori , when @xmath66 is large enough and @xmath67 is in the above range .",

    "in general , the coefficient matrix contains a number of vanishing eigenvalues for a nontrivial classical background solution .",
    "these zero modes come from the broken generators of the orthogonal symmetry in such a background , and have been analyzed completely for @xmath14-dimensional fuzzy flat tori in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since these modes should physically correspond to local gauge symmetry nonlinearly realized in a symmetry - breaking background @xcite , they are not of interest in comparison with the orthogonal metric fluctuation modes discussed in the previous section . in the present approximate treatment",
    ", these modes generally have very small but nonvanishing eigenvalues and can not be distinguished from the modes of interest particularly in the low - momentum regions , as was problematic in ref .",
    "@xcite . to overcome the problem , in the present numerical analysis",
    ", the coefficient matrix will be projected to the subspace orthogonal to the approximate broken symmetry modes that are obtained by infinitesimally applying the orthogonal transformations to the gaussian solutions .",
    "the eigenvalue / mode analysis will be carried out for the projected coefficient matrix .    because of the translational symmetry of the torus backgrounds , the coefficient matrix is a direct sum of the submatrices of each momentum sector labeled by the momentum @xmath70 of the fluctuations @xmath71 . therefore the eigenvalue / mode analysis will be carried out for each momentum sector of the fluctuations .",
