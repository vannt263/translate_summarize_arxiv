    "the fundamental group of a pair of pants ( that is , a sphere from which three disjoint open discs have been removed ) is free on two generators . fix a pair of generators , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , of this group , each of them represented by a simple closed curve parallel to one of the boundary components",
    ". then every free homotopy class of closed curves on the pair of pants can be represented uniquely as a reduced cyclic word in the symbols @xmath2 .",
    "( a _ cyclic word _ @xmath3 is an equivalence class of words up to a cyclic permutation of their letters ; _ reduced _ means that the cyclic word contains no juxtapositions of @xmath0 with @xmath4 , or @xmath1 with @xmath5 . )",

    "consider a hyperbolic metric ( that is , a metric with constant negative one curvature ) on the pair of pants such that each of the boundary components is a geodesic .",
    "it is well known ( see , for instance , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1.7 ) ) that such hyperbolic metric on the pair of pants is determined by the lengths , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , of the three geodesics at each of the boundary components . after fixing @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 every free homotopy class of curves",
    "@xmath3 can be a associated with a _ geometric length @xmath11 _ , the length of the unique geodesic in that class .",
    "the goal of this note is to study how the geometric length @xmath12 varies over the population @xmath13 of all reduced cyclic words @xmath3 of word length @xmath14 for each positive integer @xmath14 .",
    "( the set @xmath13 is endowed with the uniform measure )    we choose a few representative metrics ( mainly , the ratio between boundary components is about the same or very different ) . using the parametrization described in section [ section : param ] , we computed the length of a sample of @xmath15 words of @xmath16 letters and studied the distribution .",

    "the `` peaks '' in the graph are due to the following : the length of @xmath10 of one of the boundary components is very large compared to @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the length of a cyclic reduced word @xmath3 will be roughly , @xmath29 times the number of occurrences of @xmath30 and @xmath31 in @xmath3 .",
    "since it is not computationally feasible to study very long words with the metric @xmath28 , we study instead the metric @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath14 is small compared with @xmath10 ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) , we still see `` peaks '' in the histogram , approximately at multiples of @xmath35 .",
    "the peaks start to disappear when @xmath14 is @xmath36 and do not appear at all when @xmath14 is @xmath37 this suggests that the `` peaks '' will gradually disappear when the word length goes to infinity .",
    "on the other hand , difference between the histograms of the metrics @xmath27 and @xmath38 comes from the fact that our choice of basis for the fundamental group of the pair of pants , although natural , is not symmetrical , in the sense that we arbitrarily chose two of the three boundary components .    .",
