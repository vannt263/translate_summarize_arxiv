    "the estimation of the uncertainty of a theoretical model is of great importance to evaluate the predicted ability of the model  @xcite .",
    "the standard statistical methods , such as the least square and @xmath1 fitting , are widely used in the parametrization of various models .",
    "specially in nuclear physics , the methods are used to control the validity of the data fitting procedure in the liquid drop model ( ld )  @xcite , finite - range droplet model  @xcite , lublin - strasbourg drop model  @xcite , woods - saxon model  @xcite , and skyrme ( like ) force  @xcite .",
    "various of observed data can be considered in the fitting procedure , such as the nuclear mass , radius , single particle energies , deformations , and so on .",
    "taking nuclear mass models for example , the total uncertainties are obtained to be around @xmath2 mev from the fitting procedure in the finite - range droplet model  @xcite , the lublin - strasbourg drop model  @xcite , the hartree - fock - bogoliubov model  @xcite , and the weizscker - skyrme mass model  @xcite .",
    "the recent version of weizscker - skyrme mass model considers the effect of the surface diffuseness , which is important for nuclei with extreme isospin  @xcite .",
    "such effect is especially evident for the extremely neutron - rich nuclei , because the valence neutron may extend very far due to the lack of the coulomb barrier .",
    "recent investigation on the heaviest known neutron - halo nuclei , @xmath3c , show that the upper limit of the radius is a key characteristic of the two - neutron halo  @xcite .",
    "it is of great interesting to investigate the details of the total uncertainty obtained from fitting procedures .",
    "the total uncertainty normally comes from three parts , the model , the experiment , and the numerical method  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty from the model consists two parts , the statistical uncertainty from the not exactly determined parameters and the systematic uncertainty from the deficiency of the model .",
    "the systematic uncertainty is hard to be estimated because its origin is the deficiency of the theoretical model  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the systematic uncertainty are obtained by comparing a variety of models .",
    "two illustrative examples are given to estimate the systematic uncertainty by analysing the residues  @xcite .",
    "here we suggest a practical method to decompose the statistical and systematic uncertainties from the total uncertainty and its distribution in one model in the case of large sample . in the case of large sample",
    ", both distributions of statistical and systematic uncertainties are considered as normal distributions .",
    "the moments of the residues are used to constrain the normal function . in the parametrization of the model , the uncertainty of each model parameters is obtained through the standard fitting procedure .",
    "the standard deviation of the statistical uncertainty is estimated through the randomly generated parameters following the normal distribution defined by their uncertainties .    to decompose the total uncertainty , as an example",
    ", a possible choice is applying to the ld because of its simplicity .",
    "the uncertainty of the model parameters can be easily obtained through the linear fitting procedure .",
    "one of the well known deficiencies of the ld is the lack of the shell effect .",
    "it is helpful for further discussion when the present decomposition method applying to the ld with and without the shell effect .",
    "an observed data @xmath4 is described by a model with a few parameters @xmath5 . after fitting procedure ,",
    "the values and uncertainties of all parameters are obtained , @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the @xmath8th parameters .",
    "its total uncertainty , defined by the residue @xmath9 , includes three parts , the uncertainties from the model , the experiment , and the numerical method  @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "only uncertainties from the model are considered for simplicity , including statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "it is reasonable for the ld because the experimental uncertainty of the binding energy is generally very small  @xcite and the numerical uncertainty of a linear and analytical model is negligible .",
    "the distribution of the total uncertainty is the sum of the distributions of the statistical and systematic uncertainties . in the case of a large sample ,",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that the statistical and systematic uncertainties follow the normal distribution , although not exactly .",
    "a normal distribution is labeled as @xmath10 , with the mean value @xmath11 and the standard deviation @xmath12 .",
    "the distribution of total uncertainty is : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the normalized factor .",
    "the mean values @xmath15 and @xmath16 are generally separated , which is rarely discussed in the previous works .",
    "the moments are important quantities in the description of a distribution , such as the mean value ( first moment ) , variance ( second moment ) , skewness ( third moment ) , kurtosis ( fourth moment ) . applying the calculations of moments to eq .",
    "( [ residue ] ) : @xmath17 the moments in the left hand side are calculated through the distribution of @xmath18 . the right hand side is obtained through the properties of the normal distribution . in principal the mean values and variances of the statistical and systematic uncertainties can be obtained through eq .",
    "( [ residue3 ] ) . however it sometimes has no physical solution because the normal distribution assumption is not exactly",
    ".    the variance of the statistical uncertainty can be simulated through @xmath6 and @xmath7 : @xmath19^{2}}{m}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath20 is randomly generated through a normal distribution @xmath21 .",
    "the statistical uncertainty comes from the uncertainty of the parameters of the model . for the @xmath22th term",
    ", we randomly select one @xmath23 and one parameter @xmath6 from all possible candidates , while other parameters the same as the best fitted values . the number @xmath24 is chosen to be sufficient large comparing with the number of the observed data .",
    "such procedure simulates the deviation comes from the uncertainty of the parameters of the model .",
    "it is the estimation of the variance of the statistical uncertainty .    together with the first two equations in eq .",
    "( [ residue3 ] ) , one can express @xmath16 and @xmath25 by @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath0 , and @xmath15 .",
    "only one unknown remains in the latter two equations in eq .",
    "( [ residue3 ] ) .",
    "one can calculate the @xmath28 and @xmath29 as the function of @xmath15 and minimize , @xmath30 to estimate the value of @xmath15 , which is the criteria for the present study .",
    "the method discussed is labeled as the uncertainty decomposition method ( udm ) .    in the present work ,",
    "the udm is applied to the ld .",
    "the ld is an empirical model describing the binding energies and other bulk properties of nuclei .",
    "microscopic approaches describe the binding energies of most nuclei with good accuracy , such as the energy density functional theory  @xcite and the hartree - fock - bogoliubov method  @xcite . some other microscopic approaches , such as the nuclear shell model ,",
    "concentrate on the light and medium mass nuclei .",
    "our previous works show that the shell model can give a precise description on the light nuclei from stability line to both the neutron and proton drip line  @xcite .",
    "the ld can give well description on the binding energies of nuclei  @xcite with the standard shell correction procedure  @xcite .",
    "the original ld mass formula includes the volume energy , the surface energy , the coulomb energy , the volume term of proton - neutron asymmetry energy , and the paring energy  @xcite .",
    "many additional terms are introduced to include more physical effect . such as",
    ", the surface energy of proton - neutron asymmetry is introduced to the ld mass formula  @xcite .",
    "the ld mass formula is given as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 for even - even , odd - even , and odd - odd nuclei , respectively . from and after we label eq .",
    "( [ ld6 ] ) as ld6 because of its six parameters .",
    "it should be noted that there are several forms of the surface asymmetry term when introducing to the ld  @xcite .",
    "these six parameters are considered to be the most important terms for nuclear binding in a macroscopic view and reproduce experimental binding energies , generally speaking , within the precision of @xmath34 .",
    "the largest deviation comes from the lack of the shell effect .",
    "strutinsky procedure is the standard method to introduce the shell effect to the ld  @xcite .",
    "a shell correction term is presented as the function of the number of the valence nucleons respected to the closed shell  @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 with @xmath37 is the number of the valence neutron ( proton ) respected to the nearest closed shell .",
    "it is obvious that in an illustrative view the shell correction is related to the number of the valence nucleons . here",
    ", we use an illustrative function for shell correction to ignore the numerical uncertainty and for further discussion : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the spin - orbit magic numbers , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 for both proton and neutron , and @xmath44 for neutron , and @xmath45 with @xmath46 the strength of the shell correction .",
    "the function considers the shell effect in an illustrative way that the nuclei around doubly magic nuclei get extra binding energy .",
    "the shell correction decreases when nuclei go far away from the doubly magic nuclei , with @xmath47 the scale of the distance .",
    "the exclusion of the magic numbers @xmath48 and @xmath49 is because the ld6 do not show the systematic necessity of the extra binding energy for the nuclei around these two magic numbers .",
    "the possible reason is that the ld works insufficiently in the light region .    with the shell correction term eq .",
    "( [ shell2 ] ) , the ld mass formula can be written as : @xmath50 which is labeled as ld8 in the later discussion . in the following section ,",

    "@xmath51 nuclei are selected from ame2012 , which are around the stability line @xmath52  @xcite and with the small observed uncertainties of the binding energies ( in general , @xmath53 kev at @xmath54 , @xmath55 kev at @xmath56 , and @xmath57 kev at @xmath58 ) .",
    "table  [ parastable ] presents the parameters obtained from these data for ld8 , ld6 , ld7 , and ld5 .",
    "the fittings of the ld8 and ld6 give large uncertainty on the surface asymmetry term .",
    "the ld7 and ld5 are then fitted without this term , defined as follow , respectively : @xmath59 @xmath60    it is obvious that the nuclei around stability line are less representative than all measured nuclei with larger uncertainties in each parameters of the ld , partially because of the less number of the data and partially because of the different function of each parameter .",
    "for example , both the paring and shell terms are less correlated to the isospin and other terms .",
    "the uncertainty of these two parameters changes not much for the data from the stability line to all measured nuclei because the most important change is on the isospin degree of freedom .",
    "the uncertainty of the volume and surface asymmetry term changes a lot as the isospin changes .",
    "the uncertainty of the surface asymmetry term is much larger than that of the volume asymmetry term because @xmath61 is generally much smaller than @xmath62 .",
    "thus the uncertainty of the surface asymmetry term is very large ( around @xmath63 ) if only nuclei near stability line is considered .",
    "it is stated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the form of the surface symmetry term is obtained not from any evidence of the nuclear mass but from the form of the volume asymmetry term .",
    "the udm results of these sets of parameters of the ld are presented in the table  [ udmstable ] . because of the large uncertainties of the parameters , the estimated @xmath64 is larger than @xmath65 in most cases , which is the limitation of the udm .",
    "although the systematic uncertainties can not be determined among the large statistical uncertainties , many interesting discussions can be addressed .",
    "the standard deviations @xmath12 of the nuclei around stability line decrease a little from the ld5 to ld6 and from the ld7 to ld8 because of the added surface asymmetry term while the statistical uncertainty increases .",
    "it indicates that this term is not very necessary for the nuclei around stability line , which agrees with the original form of the ld . in the ld6 and ld8 ,",
    "@xmath12 of the residues from stability line are similar compared with to that from all measured nuclei .",
    "although the surface asymmetry term can be excluded when the data is around stability line and its uncertainty is rather large if included , its value is acceptable obtained ( the best fitted values in table  [ para ] are inside @xmath66 in table  [ parastable ] ) and very useful for the prediction .",
    "it is reasonable because the surface asymmetry term has its physical meaning on the isospin degree of freedom .",
    "the real uncertainty is less than the estimation .",
    "the situation of the heavy nuclei is similar .",
    "although the estimated uncertainty is large , the real uncertainty is much smaller for both the binding energies and the neutron separation energies because the liquid drop assumption is suitable for the heavy nuclei .    in the ld5 and ld7 , @xmath12 of the residues from all measured nuclei",
    "are dramatically larger compared with that from stability line .",
    "it is expected because the nuclei near stability line , @xmath52 , is nearly one dimension on the chart of nuclei , which misses many terms on isospin degree of freedom correlated to other degrees of freedom .",
    "such as , for certain @xmath67 , @xmath68 is limited around @xmath69 .",
    "the correlation between @xmath67 and other @xmath68 are missing .",
    "figure  [ ld7sd ] presents the comparison of the results of the ld7 for both the nuclei around stability line and all measured nuclei .",
    "it is clearly seen that the parameters obtained from the stability line fail when approaching to neutron- and proton - rich nuclei .",
    "it is nice to see that the standard deviations of the statistical uncertainties @xmath0 keep almost the same from the stability line to all measured nuclei in both the ld5 and ld7 .",
    "such estimated @xmath0 can be used in the udm and give nice description on the residues , seen from fig .",
    "[ ld7counts ] taking the ld7 for example .",
    "although estimated @xmath0 seem to be large when only data around stability line is concentrated , their values are indeed useful for predictions in the global chart of nuclide even if some important terms are missing , such as the surface asymmetry term .",
    "but of course the systematic uncertainty may be very large .",
    "it is expected that the estimated @xmath0 obtained from the present observed data in sec .",
    "[ sec : level3 ] is useful to scale the statistical uncertainty for unmeasured nuclei .",
    "but as discussed before , such estimations are more suitable for a global investigation , may not for local cases .    in fig .",
    "[ ld7counts ] , the normalized factor of @xmath70 is set to be one , which shows that the statistical uncertainty is very large that the systematic uncertainty can not be clarified for the nuclei around the stability line .",
    "it is seen that the systematic uncertainty less contributes to the residues of these nuclei with the same set of parameters when the data changes to all measured nuclei .",
    "in conclusion , a method is suggested to decompose the statistical and systematic uncertainties of a theoretical model after fitting procedure .",
    "the two uncertainties are obtained through the total uncertainty and the model parameters obtained from the fitting . such uncertainty decomposition method ( udm )",
    "are applied to the liquid drop model ( ld ) as an example .",
    "the estimated distribution can well reproduce the distribution of the residues of the binding energies .",
    "the specific nuclei locate where the physical considerations expect in the estimated distribution obtained without these considerations . such as the light nuclei and nuclei close to shell locate mostly inside the distribution of the systematic uncertainty , while the heavy nuclei and nuclei far from shell inside the distribution of the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the results are obtained purely from the mathematic forms of the ld and the observed data .",
    "thus the udm may be useful for the discovery of hinted physics in certain cases .",
    "the validity of the udm is tested through various approaches .",
    "it is acceptable that the distribution of the statistical and systematic uncertainties are assumed to be normal .",
    "the present work is constrained in the simple model under the simple statistical assumptions to see what can be obtain from the residues .",
    "it should be noted that the realistic distributions of the statistical uncertainty from the model parameters and the parameters themselves are still not clearly known for the present simple model and some modern nuclear mass model , such as the hartree - fock - bogoliubov model  @xcite and the weizsecker - skyrme mass model  @xcite . some advanced method to deal with the systematic uncertainty of the mass model are of great interesting , such as the image reconstruction techniques  @xcite , the radial basis function approach  @xcite , and the method for the evaluation of ame2012  @xcite .",
    "the former two reconstruct the uncertainty through the systematic trends of the residues , while the latter evaluates huge amount of the observed values and their uncertainties .",
    "the present work also shows the effectiveness and limitation of the udm in the investigation of the unmeasured nuclei . in a global view , the statistical uncertainty are well estimated even when certain important terms in the model are missing .",
    "the statistical uncertainty may be overestimated or underestimated in the specific regions of nuclei , such as the heavy and light nuclei .",
    "more statistical methods combined with the physical considerations should be considered to simulate the uncertainties of the parameters and the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the present work shows that the residues indeed includes more information beyond the most used two , the mean value and the standard deviation , which are rarely discussed before .",
    "it is expected that the udm can be used in other theoretical works , such as fitting effective nuclear force to nuclear data , which is helpful for the study of the statistical and systematic uncertainties of the levels through the nuclear shell model .",
