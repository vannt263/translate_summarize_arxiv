    "thus , it is the purpose of this paper to analyze the normal - current @xmath5 supercurrent conversion processes in a superconducting layer of finite length @xmath6 between two normal current leads .",

    "conventional scattering processes are disregarded because we are only interested in as in the @xmath2 interfaces . in principle , impurity scattering could be treated with the help of the scattering matrix formulation @xcite .",
    "this is especially convenient for devices that , unlike the ones considered by us , involve only a small number of incoming and outgoing channels .",

    "this `` instantaneous '' coupling may seem to be surprising , but only at a first look . giving it a second thought",
    "one sees that our result confirms by explicit wavepacket calculation , and for the first time , as far as we know , what one has concluded before intuitively and from steady state calculations : hole @xmath4 electron scattering destroys and electron @xmath4 hole scattering creates supercurrents , whenever currents flow through @xmath126 and @xmath2 interfaces , e.g. in vortex lines @xcite . both scattering processes must occur simultaneously even at far - apart interfaces because of charge conservation in closed circuits _ and _ as a direct consequence of the very essence of bcs superconductivity : cooper pairs are * not * bosons , despite of what one can read frequently , because within the volume of one cooper pair of a conventional superconductor there are about one million of mass centers of other cooper pairs , their creation and destruction operators do not satisfy bosonic commutation relations , and their condensate wavefunction is antisymmetric @xcite .",
    "therefore , the cooper pair formed by total andreev reflection in one interface can not exist outside but only within the condensate to which the momentum 2@xmath127 and the charge of the two electrons of opposite spin , that have entered the superconductor , must be transferred .",
    "because of the `` phase rigidity of the electron pair fluid '' @xcite , so typical for off - diagonal long range order , this charge and momentum transfer , and the related phase shift , manifest themselves immediately in a current flow out of the other interface .",
    "thus , no charges can accumulate in the superconductor according to its capacitance ( as charges from quasiparticles with energies @xmath128 may do ) , and the reservoir has to emit holes into and receive electrons from the right normal lead at the same rate at which it emits electrons into and receives holes from the left current lead .",
    "this is illustrated by the snapshots from a computer film in figure 1 .",
    "the andreev - reflected wavepackets may be considered as supercurrent - transmitted wavepackets as well .",
    "together with the incident wavepackets they represent any of the low lying single - particle excitations with energies @xmath62 in the current - carrying , resistive parts of the circuit .    considering the supercurrent contribution from our representative quasiparticle - wavepacket configuration",
    "we note that its spatial maximum is at @xmath129 , and its maximum in time occurs at @xmath130 . from the equations for @xmath37 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 one sees that the quasiparticle current density @xmath133(1-f_l)\\ ] ] changes into the supercurrent density @xmath37 and vice versa within a distance @xmath134 from the interfaces .    in conclusion , the combinations of single - particle excitations ( wavepackets ) and collective modes ( supercurrents ) , connected by as as shown in fig .  1 , are the consequence of the phase rigidity of the cooper - pair condensate and the adjustment of the current configuration to charge conservation in the @xmath2 and @xmath126 interfaces .",

    "if , on the other hand , the single @xmath0 layer is replaced by a mesoscopic @xmath137 junction , the many - body configuration in the central @xmath1 layer is a phase - coherent one and thus different from the uncorrelated configurations in the normal current leads . in an @xmath138 circuit the @xmath137 junction acts as a gapless superconductor @xcite .",
