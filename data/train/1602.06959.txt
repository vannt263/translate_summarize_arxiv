    "diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) are ubiquitous absorption detected in the spectra of reddened stars .",
    "recent surveys have discovered more than 500 dibs in the near - uv to near - infrared ( nir ) wavelength range @xcite .",
    "although no dib carriers have been successfully identified , the absorption features might mainly be contributed by organic compounds @xcite .",
    "recently , some reseachers have attempted to directly identify the dib carriers by measuring the absorption spectra of gas - phase organic molecules in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "@xcite , in the first study regarding the successful identification of dib carriers , confirmed that ionized buckminsterfullerene ( c@xmath6 ) is responsible for two dibs at @xmath79577 and 9633 .",
    "these bands were originally proposed to coincide with the spectral features of c@xmath6 .",
    "elucidating the behavior of dibs in various environments would help us to identify the properties of the carriers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and possibly enable new diagnostics of the physical parameters of gas clouds . the dib equivalent width ( ew ) ratio @xmath8 is known to depend on the uv radiation field @xcite .",
    "because these dibs are easily observed by optical spectroscopy , this ratio can indicate the uv radiation field of the gas clouds toward , for example , the extragalactic lines of sight @xcite . in dense clouds ,",
    "some strong dibs ( e.g. , @xmath9 and 6614 ) are relatively weaker than what is expected from the @xmath10 correlations .",
    "this is considered to be because the molecules are shielded from uv photons @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some weak dibs are suggested to be well correlated with c@xmath2 column densities @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated dibs originating from the interstellar clouds in the magellanic clouds , reporting that the three strong dibs @xmath9 , and 6284 become weaker by factors of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , toward the large and small magellanic clouds than in the galactic interstellar environment ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they suggested that the dibs are weakened by the lower metallicity and higher uv radiation in the magellanic clouds .",
    "nir observations are advantageous for exploring dibs toward stars with high extinctions .",
    "therefore , they should also prove useful for investigating the environment - dependent properties of dibs @xcite .",
    "nir dib observations have been limited because the performance of nir high - resolution spectrographs ( e.g. , spectral resolution and sensitivity ) is lower than that of optical spectrographs .",
    "however , nir spectrography has progressed sufficiently to enable high - sensitivity searching for nir dibs @xcite .",
    "we are advancing the first comprehensive dib survey in the nir wavelength range using a newly developed high - resolution nir spectrograph winered @xcite . in our first paper (",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we successfully identified 15 new dibs in the range @xmath13 m .",
    "seven of these dibs were reported as dib candidates by @xcite .",
    "we suggested two dib families ( one consisting of @xmath1410780 , 10792 , and 11797 , and the other consisting of @xmath1410504 , 12623 , and 13175 ) , whose ews are highly correlated ( are @xmath15 ; see paper i ) .    in this paper , we investigate the environmental dependence of nir dibs from the high - resolution spectra of seven early - type stars in cyg ob2 newly obtained the winered spectrograph .",
    "cyg ob2 , located at the distance of @xmath111.5 kpc from the sun @xcite , is one of the most massive clusters or ob associations in our galaxy",
    ". statistical analysis of 2mass survey data suggests as many as @xmath11 2600 ob stars in this association @xcite . despite its proximity , cyg ob2",
    "is known to be veiled with heavy interstellar extinction .",
    "this large extinction is partly ascribed to the dust lane called the great cygnus rift , located at an estimated distance of 850 @xmath16 25 pc from the sun ( based on color - magnitude diagrams of the cyg ob2 region ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to @xcite , who calculated the individual extinctions of 164 ob stars ( including our targets ) , the extinctions of cyg ob2 members generally have a range of 47 mags , with a median @xmath10 of 5.4 mag , although the extinction of no.12 is anomalously large ( @xmath17 mag ) .",
    "the large spread of the extinctions might be caused by foreground extinction and/or intra - cluster extinctions @xcite .",
    "cyg ob2 is known as one of the best lines of because of its large extinction @xcite .",
    "the gas clouds along lines of sight have been extensively investigated from the absorption lines of various small molecules , such as c@xmath2 , cn , co , and h@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the mm - wave emission lines of co and cs have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "because of its strong association with h@xmath18 molecules , cyg ob2 no.12 has attracted particular attention @xcite .",
    "@xcite developed a model that reproduced the abundances of h@xmath18 , c@xmath2 and co toward no.12 .",
    "according to this model , the h@xmath18 absorption originates from the diffuse component , whereas c@xmath2 and co are formed in the embedded denser component . from the c@xmath2 phillips bands of no.12 , @xcite derived the density as @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "dense gas clouds are also supported by the observed co emission lines @xcite .",
    "the abundances of co , c@xmath2 , cn and ch can be explained by the chemistry induced under high x - ray fluxes from early - type stars in the association @xcite . as such",
    ", the clouds toward cyg ob2 have complex density structures and are probably exposed to the strong fluxes of high - energy photons from ob stars , which would affect the ews of the dibs .",

    "this slit width corresponds to a or @xmath27 km s@xmath24 . immediately prior to observation in august 2014",
    ", we installed an @xmath28-band blocking filter to decrease the thermal leak in the 1.71.8 @xmath21 m range .",
    "the new filter successfully decreased the background noise , yielding spectra with high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "however , the new filter was slightly bent by the tight mechanical mounting , causing a slight off - focus of the light on the infrared array . consequently ,",
    "the spectral resolution became @xmath29 , which is lower than the nominal value .",
    "because we here focus on the ews of the dibs , the lower spectral resolution does not significantly affect our results and following discussion .",
    "we observed the seven brightest stars in the @xmath30-band in cyg ob2 ( no.3 , 5 , 8a , 9 , 10 , 11 , and 12 ) .",
    "the observations , which were made during september and october of 2014 , are summarized in table [ cygtargets ] .",
    "we also observed the telluric standard a0v - type stars at similar airmasses to the target airmasses .",
    "although target no.12 was previously observed by us ( paper i ) , the engineering array in that observation introduced large systematic noise . in the present study",
    "we re - investigate no.12 for more accurate dib ew estimates .",
    "only the newly obtained data are analyzed in the present paper .",
    "all data were reduced with iraf using standard procedures , including sky subtraction , flat fielding , extraction of spectra , and wavelength calibration with argon lamp spectra . to remove the telluric absorption lines ,",
    "the target spectra were divided by those of the corresponding standard stars .",
    "note that we did not remove the hydrogen and metal absorption lines in the standard stars , because these features are often contaminated by atmospheric absorption lines , which complicates their profile fitting and removal .",

    "by analogy to the @xmath45780.5 carrier , which appears to be a cation from the dependence of its ew on the ambient uv radiation field @xcite , we suggest that the family of nir dibs also arise from cations .",
    "this idea is compatible with the dib - pah hypothesis , which proposes that the ionized pahs are the carriers have their transitions in nir wavelength range @xcite .",
    "recently , in the first conclusive identification of dib carriers , two dibs at @xmath60 were assigned to the absorption features of interstellar ionized buckminsterfullerene ( c@xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "ionized fullerenes and their derivatives are also expected as the carrier sources of nir dibs .",
    "we investigated the environmental dependence of dibs toward cyg ob2 using winered spectrograph data .",
    "we observed the seven brightest ob stars in the @xmath30 band in cyg ob2 , and detected all known nir dibs with large ews toward all observed stars in the wavelength coverage of winered .",
    "our findings are summarized below :    1 .",
    "five of the dibs ( @xmath1410780 , 10792 , 11797 , 12623 , and 13175 ) are well correlated , suggesting similar physical and/or chemical properties of their carriers .",
    "the ews of dib @xmath410504 , which were suggested to be well correlated with the family of nir dibs in paper i , are almost constant toward cyg ob2 . in contrast , the ews of the family of nir dibs vary by a factor of two .",
    "we attribute the different behaviors of the dib @xmath410504 and the family to the environmental sensitivity of the dib @xmath410504 carrier .",
    "none of the nir dibs are correlated with the c@xmath2 column densities , suggesting that the nir dib carriers are distributed mainly in the diffuse component rather than the dense component , in which the c@xmath2 molecules are distributed .",
    "plotting the ews of dib @xmath410504 as a function of @xmath31 , we found that @xmath410504 toward cyg ob2 derivates from the linear correlation derived from the data in paper i , becoming weaker than expected .",
    "this suggests that @xmath410504 differs from the family nir dibs in cyg ob2 because its carrier is removed .",
    "according to the regression line in the plot , the average ew of @xmath410504 ( 78.4@xmath165.4 m ) corresponds to @xmath61mag , similar to the lower limit of the extinction distribution of ob stars in cyg ob2 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath410504 carrier seems to be completely destroyed in cyg ob2 .",
    "considering the high uv radiation field in cyg ob2 , we surmise that the carrier is removed by processes such as dissociation and ionization .",
