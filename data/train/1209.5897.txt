    "the idea @xcite that our four - dimensional world is one of the boundaries of a slice of strongly curved five - dimensional ( 5d ) anti - de - sitter space provides an attractive approach to the gauge - gravity and flavour hierarchy problems of the standard model ( sm ) . in conformal coordinates the metric of the 5d bulk is @xmath7 where @xmath8gev is of order of the planck scale @xmath9 , while the metric on the four - dimensional boundaries located at @xmath10 and @xmath11 is flat .",
    "this set - up provides a solution to the gauge - gravity hierarchy problem , since , if the proper distance between the two branes , @xmath12 , is only a few times the planck length , then @xmath13 can still be of order of the tev scale . the original proposal @xcite considered only gravity propagating in the bulk ,",
    "but it was soon realized that the sm fields may be 5d , too  @xcite .",
    "an exception is the higgs field , which in the simplest set - up is required to be localized on the tev brane @xmath11 to solve the hierarchy problem . allowing the sm fermions to propagate into",
    "the fifth dimension opens up the possibility to explain the quark and lepton mass , and the quark mixing - angle hierarchies @xcite without postulating large hierarchies or small coupling constants in the 5d theory .",
    "the model predicts kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of the sm particles with typical kk mass @xmath14 for the first excitation . the collider physics and flavour phenomenology of these kk excitations has been extensively studied .",
    "direct searches at the large hadron collider lead to lower limits on @xmath15 similar to those for drell - yan like single production of heavy resonances , which are now in the 1 to 2 tev region .",
    "indirect constraints from electroweak precision observables and flavour require higher kk masses , but may be avoided by adding custodial protection or flavour structure .",
    "the overwhelming number of studies is based on investigating the implications of tree - level production or tree - level exchange of the kk excitations .    comparatively little",
    "is known about the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model at the loop level due to the intricacies of quantum field theory in curved space - times .",
    "it appears that contrary to 5d theories with a flat compact extra dimension , the running of gauge couplings is only logarithmic @xcite .",
    "divergences associated with the fifth dimension show up in divergent kk sums .",
    "the interpretation of these divergences is not as straightforward as in minkowski space .",
    "a precise regularization scheme , required to be able to calculate finite renormalizations , has not yet been developed . at the same time",
    ", there are a number of processes of much interest for searching for deviations of the sm , which arise only at the loop level ; among them are the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , and electromagnetic dipole transitions in the lepton ( @xmath16 ) and the quark sectors ( @xmath17 ) , which have been considered in the rs model in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "higgs production through gluon - gluon fusion has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the systematics of renormalization and the calculation of loop processes is probably easier to approach from the 5d perspective @xcite instead of the kk decomposition of the dependence on the fifth coordinate . in this paper we set up the propagator and vertex feynman rules for the 5d quantum field theory in a slice of anti - de - sitter ( ads ) space (",

    "there is only one previous calculation of @xmath18 in the rs model @xcite , which is based on summing over towers of kk excitations .",

    "we assume that the scale @xmath13 is much larger than the masses of the sm electroweak gauge bosons and the higgs boson . in this case",
    "we may integrate out the fifth dimension , that is , the towers of kk states to obtain an effective four - dimensional theory . since the states with masses below @xmath13 are precisely represented by the sm fields , the four - dimensional theory is the sm plus su(3)@xmath19su(2)@xmath19u(1 ) invariant higher - dimension operators .",
    "an issue that arises here is that the 5d theory is non - renormalizable and must itself be defined as an effective theory below a scale @xmath42 that should be at least a few times the planck scale .",
    "it is generally believed that in the mixed representation the four - dimensional loop momenta should be cut - off at a value @xmath43 that depends on the position @xmath37 in the fifth dimension . if @xmath44 is a few times the planck scale , then the cut - off @xmath45 relevant to processes dominated by physics near the tev brane should be near the tev scale .",
    "this would render the naive application of the 5d formalism problematic , since it encodes the sum over all kk states rather than including only the few below the cut - off @xmath45 .",
    "however , for a finite quantity such as the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , the kk sum must converge , and the effect of including the entire tower relative to the truncation is of order @xmath46 , which is the generic size of corrections expected from the uv completion of the rs model .",

    "it is understood that the fields in the 4d effective lagrangian correspond to the zero modes in the kk decomposition of the 5d fields .",

    "in this section we provide explicit expressions for the diagrams relevant to the matching of the dipole operator . to simplify the expressions , we consider the diagrams with an external photon , that is the linear combination @xmath697 of diagrams with an external hypercharge and su(2 ) gauge boson .",
    "we furthermore assume that the external higgs field ( represented by a grey square ) has a vanishing upper isospin component , that is we pick up the lower component only , since this is relevant when @xmath33 is replaced by its vacuum expectation value .",
    "these simplifications allow us to drop diagrams , which are proportional to @xmath698 . using @xmath699",
    "it is always possible to extract the 5d electromagnetic coupling .",
    "the electric charge of a fermion @xmath552 in units of positron charge is denoted by @xmath700 . in our convention",

    "we use the short - hand @xmath704 and @xmath705 for momenta in the loops .",
    "the labels of the diagrams correspond to those given in figure [ fig : diagsall ] . the first expression for each diagram does not make use of any simplification .",
    "vertex factors and propagators are written in the form as given in appendix  [ ap:5drules ] and no terms have been omitted .",
    "the second expression already includes some simplifications . in particular , the terms that vanish due to the presence of chiral projectors after multiplying out the chiral components of the fermion propagators have been dropped .",
    "this second representation is exact only if the diagram does not contain an insertion of the higgs field into an external line , since we applied the replacement ( [ extfirstterm ] ) .",
    "the ( small , see discussion in the main text ) `` off - shell '' terms present in these diagrams is not shown explicitly and must be added .",
    "these contributions can be readily obtained from the unsimplified expressions by replacing the external fermion propagator by the zero - mode propagator only , e.g. , in b2a one would replace @xmath706 one then applies standard dirac algebra and simplifications as for the other term shown explicitly , including an expansion in the external momenta @xmath207 , @xmath208 to the appropriate order .",

    "<S> we calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in the minimal randall - sundrum model with standard model fields in five - dimensional ( 5d ) warped space and a brane - localized higgs . </S>",
    "<S> we use a fully 5d framework to compute the one - loop matching coefficients of the effective theory at the electroweak scale . the extra contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment from the model - independent gauge - boson exchange contributions </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the location of the tev brane in conformal coordinates , and is related to the mass of the lowest gauge boson kk excitation by @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the result constitutes the first complete determination of the gauge - boson contribution to @xmath3 and is robust against the variation of the bulk fermion masses and 5d yukawa coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we also determine the strongly model - parameter dependent effect of higgs - exchange diagrams .    </S>",
