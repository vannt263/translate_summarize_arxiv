    "the blandford - znajek ( bz ) mechanism @xcite is believed to be one of most efficient way to extract rotation energy from a spinning black hole ( bh ) , which operates in bh systems on all mass scales , from the stellar - mass bhs of gamma ray bursts to the supermassive bhs of active galactic nuclei . in the past decade , we have gained more and more understanding of the bz mechanism from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) simulations @xcite , analytic studies @xcite and numerical solutions @xcite .",
    "various studies converge to a common picture of how the bz mechanism works : poloidal magnetic field @xmath4 , threads non - rotating bhs , while spinning bhs distorts those field lines and induces poloidal electric fields @xmath5 and toroidal magnetic fields @xmath6 , thus an outward poynting flux @xmath7 is generated along the magnetic field lines threading the spinning bh , and the rotation energy of the spinning bhs is extracted in the form of poynting flux .    while there were some clues that bh rotation tends to expel magnetic field lines out of the event horizon , which is known as the bh meissner effect .",
    "@xcite gave the vacuum solution for the electromagnetic field when a kerr bh is placed in an originally uniform magnetic field aligned along the bh rotation axis .",
    "for this solution , @xcite found all magnetic field expelled out of the horizon of an extremal kerr bh .",
    "@xcite generalized this result and showed that for all steady axisymmetric vacuum solutions , no non - monopole component of magnetic flux penetrates the event horizon if the bh is extremal . consequently , there were some concerns that the bz mechanism would be quenched if the bh meissner effect works in real astrophysical environment . but such effect was never seen in previous grmhd simulations .",
    "different field line types in bh magnetosphere found in simulations were discussed in @xcite .    to explain the absence of the meissner effect in time - dependent simulations ,",
    "quite a few possibilities have been discussed .",
    "non - axisymmetry was proposed @xcite to evade the effect , but it does not explain the absence of the meissner effect in axisymmetic simulations .",
    "@xcite argued that it is conductivity that breaks the bh meissner effect .",
    "as they pointed out , the wald solution and all vacuum solutions constructed by @xcite are electric current fixed .",
    "introducing conductivity completely changes the current distribution and the magnetic field configurations .",
    "recently , @xcite put forward that the bh meissner effect is a geometry effect , which allows purely ( split ) monopole magnetic fields at the horizon of an extremal kerr bh and all other field components would be expelled .",
    "but the conclusion seems controversial : taking the most well studied asymptotically split - monopole solution as an example @xcite , the magnetic field is purely monopole only in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "bh rotation distorts the field configuration and the distortion becomes larger for faster spinning bhs .",
    "so the magnetic fields are no longer purely monopole in the kerr spacetime , especially for extremal kerr bhs .",
    "@xcite also argued that higher multipole components may be superposed on the monopole component on the event horizon even for extremal kerr bhs , if an electric current exists",
    ".    in this paper , we reinvestigated the structure of a steady axisymmetic force - free magnetosphere in the ker spacetime and the bh meissner effect .",
    "it is known that the magnetosphere structure is governed by the general relativistic grad - shafranov ( gs ) equation .",
    "a perturbation approach was proprosed to self - consistently solve @xmath0 and determine @xmath2 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "based on the perturbation approach , we find that all known solutions to the gs equation satisfy simple boundary / constraint conditions . with these conditions , we prove that all magnetic field lines crossing the infinite redshift surface also penetrate the event horizon . hence , if the bh meissner effect operates in a force - free magnetosphere , all field lines would be expelled out of the event horizon and out of the infinite - redshift surface .",
    "we argue that this will not happen .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "basic equations governing a steady axisymmetric force - free magnetosphere in the kerr spacetime are summarized in section [ sec : basic ] . in section [ sec : boundary ] , we first introduce the analytic approach to solve the gs equation and specify boundary conditions governing @xmath2 and @xmath1 , then interpret these boundary conditions mathematically and physically . based on the boundary conditions , we study the structure of magnetic field lines near the central bh in section [ sec : field lines ] . in section [ sec : meissner ] , we argue that the bh meissner effect does not work in a force - free magnetosphere .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we sketch the basic equations governing steady axisymmetric force - free electromagnetic field around kerr black holes ( see @xcite and references therein for more details ) . we adopt the kerr - schild ( ks ) coordinate @xcite with the line element ds^2 & & = - ( 1- ) dt^2 + ( ) dr dt + ( 1 + ) dr^2 + & & + d^2 - ddt - 2 a ( 1 + ) ^2ddr + & & + d^2  , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the square root of determinant @xmath11 .",

    "based on the boundary conditions we have well understood , in this section , we will prove the following claim :    [ claim ] in the steady axisymmetric force - free magnetosphere around a kerr bh , all magnetic field lines that cross the infinite - redshift surface must intersect the event horizon .    before proceeding to the proof , it necessary to emphasize that  force - free \" implies a perfectly conductive magnetosphere , which is completely different from a non - conductive magnetosphere , e.g. , the magnetosphere of the vacuum solution constructed by @xcite .    without loss of generality , we take the asymptotically uniform vertical magnetic fields as an example . in the _ first panel _ of figure [ fig : x ] ,",
    "we plot the poloidal field lines of uniform vertical fields in the magnetosphere of a non - rotating bh , and in the _ second / third / fourth panel _ we plot the possible configurations of field lines distorted by the bh rotation .",
    "as shown in the plot , all field lines fall into three categories : type @xmath76 ( threading both the infinite - redshift surface and the event horizon ) , type @xmath77 ( threading the infinite - redshift surface only ) and type @xmath78 ( threading none of them ) .    for a non - rotating bh , the event horizon and the infinite - redshift surface coincide , so the proof is trivial . to prove claim [ claim ] for rotating bhs , we only need to prove that magnetic field lines of type @xmath77 are forbidden by physical laws , which can be done by contradiction in two steps .",
    "_ step 1 _ : if there was a field line of type @xmath77 , the field line must cross the equator . _",
    "step 2 _ : the field line of type @xmath77 can not be force - free and cross equator at the same time .",
    "_ proof of step 1 _ : it is known that a magnetic field line must close itself or ends at infinity .",
    "_ if the @xmath77 type field line does not cross the equator _",
    ", there is no way for the field line to close itself , so it must terminate at infinity .",
    "one side of the field line ends at the outer infinity , and obviously the other side must end at the event horizon ( the inner infinity ) .",
    "thus it turns out be a type @xmath76 field line ( see _ second panel _ of figure [ fig : x ] ) .",
    "_ proof of step 2 _ : if the @xmath77 type field line crosses the equator ( see _ third panel _ of figure [ fig : x ] ) , according to the symmetry across the equator , the electric current either flows towards the equator from both @xmath79 side and @xmath80 side of the field line , or flows away from the equator to infinity in both @xmath79 direction and @xmath80 direction . for each case",
    ", the electric charge conservation is violated . therefore the only viable solution is vanishing poloidal electric current along the field line , i.e , @xmath81 .",
    "according to the constraint condition [ eq.(@xmath82 ) ] , @xmath83 , the angular velocity would also vanish , @xmath84 .",
    "now we need to consider plasmas attached to the field line . due to the condition of perfect conductivity , plasmas attached to the field line corotate with it ( @xmath85 ) . while all non - rotating trajectories ( @xmath86 ) within the ergosphere are spacelike @xmath87 ( easy to see from eq.([eq : boyer ] ) , also known as the frame - dragging effect ) , so the field line of type @xmath77 is forbidden .",
    "to summarize , for a type @xmath77 field line , the symmetry requires vanishing poloidal electric current @xmath81 , the frame - dragging effect requires @xmath88 , and the convergence constraint ( or equivalent the radiation condition ) requires @xmath50 .",
    "these three requirements can not hold in the same time , therefore no type @xmath77 line is allowed in a steady axisymmetric force - free bh magnetosphere .",
    "the proof above is applicable to any steady axisymmetric force - free magnetosphere of other field configurations .",
    "more generally , simulations of both perfectly conductive , mildly conductive and non - conductive bh magnetosphere were performed @xcite .",
    "it was found that in both force - free magnetosphere and highly conductive mhd magnetosphere , all magnetic field lines threading the infinite - redshift surface also thread the event horizon ( _ second panel _ of figure [ fig : x ] ) .",
    "for mildly conductive magnetosphere , some of the magnetic field lines escape from the event horizon into the ergosphere and some are trapped by the event horizon ( _ third panel _ of figure [ fig : x ] ) .",
    "while in non - conductive magnetosphere , rotating bhs tends to expel magnetic field lines out of the horizon ( _ fourth panel _ of figure [ fig : x ] ) .",
    "such magnetic field expelling phenomena is similar to the meissner effect in superconductors , so is called as the bh meissner effect .",
    "in this section , we first give a brief introduction to the wald solution @xcite as an example of the bh meissner effect .",
    "then we show that the geometry effect proposed by @xcite does not explain the bh meissner effect .",
    "finally , we argue that the meissner effect is evaded by conductivity in a force - free bh magnetosphere .      the electromagnetic field of the wald solution measured by zamos is given by @xcite [ eq : wald ] = ( x _ , , - x_,r , 0 ) ,    = -\\ { ,   ^2_,+x ( ) _ , ,   0 } , where @xmath89 , and we have chosen the magnetic field strength at infinity to be unity . on the constant @xmath90 hypersurface , total magnetic flux threading upper semi - sphere of the event horizon is expressed as _ h & = & _ c b_r ^^ = _ c b_r dd + & = & 4(1- ) , where we have used eq.([eq:1form ] , [ eq : wald ] ) and @xmath91 .",
    "so @xmath92 , i.e. , all magnetic flux are expelled out of horizon for an extremal spinning bh ( see the _ fourth panel _ of figure [ fig : x ] , also previous works , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argued that the bh meissner effect was a geometric effect that fields are unable to reach the horizon because the the length of the bh throat blows up in the extremal limit .",
    "consider the magnetic flux threading the annulus right outside the event horizon at polar angle @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , _ = b _",
    "^r^ = 2_r_+^r_++ b_dr , where @xmath96 is an arbitrary displacement . at the extremal limit ,",
    "the right - hand side is finite only if @xmath97 goes to zero at the horizon faster than or equal to @xmath98 .",
    "hence @xcite concluded that the geometry effect `` rules out the possibility of steady axisymmetric fields threading the horizon in the extremal limit unless the field becomes entirely radial at the horizon '' .",
    "the above conclusion is correct but irrelevant , because for any field configurations , the @xmath93 component of the magnetic field approaches to zero in the way @xmath99 [ eq.([eq : eb ] , [ eq : wald ] ) ] in the vicinity of the event horizon , and consequently poloidal field lines lie in the direction of @xmath100 on the horizon .",
    "therefore no magnetic field configuration is ruled out by the finite @xmath101 requirement or equivalently the requirement of vanishing @xmath97 at the horizon .",
    "more specifically , for force - free solutions [ eq.([eq : eb ] ) ] , the magnetic flux threading the upper semi - sphere of the event horizon is _",
    "h = 2a_|_=0^=/2 , and the flux threading the annulus is _",
    "= 2a_|_r_++^r_+ .",
    "it is straightforward that @xmath101 is finite for any finite @xmath0 .",
    "therefore the finite @xmath101 requirement imposes no constraint on @xmath0 or the magnetic flux threading the horizon @xmath102 , hence is irrelevant to the bh meissner effect .",
    "+      the bh meissner effect emerges in the wald vacuum solution and other steady axisymmetric vacuum solutions .",
    "it is especially important to examine whether it operates in real astrophysical environment where bh magnetosphere are highly conductive and force - free .    assuming the bh meissener effect also works in the force - free magnetosphere : all magnetic field lines are expelled out of the horizon of an extremal kerr bh . combining claim [ claim ] we proved in section [ sec : field lines ] ,",
    "it is known that field lines penetrating the infinite redshift surface must also penetrate the event horizon , so all field lines would be expelled out of the ergosphere , i.e. , only field lines of type @xmath78 exist ( see figure [ fig : x ] ) .",
    "but such field configuration is neither natural nor stable .",
    "there is no any mechanism that would forbid electromagnetic fields within the ergosphere , so the configuration is not natural .",
    "even a magnetic field line initially located outside the ergosphere , it would be attracted into the ergosphere ( see the simulations of a single magnetic flux tube in the kerr spacetime done by @xcite ) . as long as a field line enters the ergosphere",
    ", it must terminate at the event horizon .",
    "therefore magnetic field lines in a force - free magnetosphere will not be expelled by bh rotation .",
    "people may wonder the difference between the force - free solution ( see the _ second panel _ of figure [ fig : x ] ) and the wald vacuum solution ( see the _ fourth panel _ of figure [ fig : x ] ) .",
    "for the force - free solution , the poloidal electric current @xmath2 is generated by the frame - dragging effect and the perfect conductivity , which splits all field lines of type @xmath77 at the equator ; the split field lines must terminate at the event horizon .",

    "the structure of a steady axisymmetric force - free bh magnetosphere is governed by the gs equation ( [ eq : gs ] ) , which is a second - order differential equation of @xmath103 and depends on two free functions @xmath13 and @xmath12 . to determine a solution @xmath103",
