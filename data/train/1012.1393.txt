    "cosmic ray propagation is one of the most important and interesting subjects in astrophysics and high energy particle physics .",
    "it is believed that the observed cosmic ray data such as the cosmic ray energy spectrum includes information about the space through which the cosmic rays pass .",
    "in fact , it is possible to evaluate the thickness of matter , and it is also thought that details about the galactic magnetic field can be extracted from the observed data because the cosmic rays experience frequent collision and scattering with both the interstellar gas and the galactic magnetic field during their propagation in the galaxy .",
    "thus , a reliable cosmic ray propagation model may enable us to obtain further knowledge about the galactic structure .",
    "thus far , several cosmic ray propagation models have been proposed and discussed ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "further , some researchers have successfully derived analytical solutions using the diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of cosmic rays shows one of the most distinctive features , known as `` knee '' , around energy @xmath1 ev at which the exponent of the energy spectrum , @xmath0 , changes from 2.6  2.7 for @xmath2 ev to 3  3.1 for @xmath3 ev .",
    "currently , it is not clear why the exponent changes around @xmath1 ev . thus far , several models have been proposed to explain this spectral property : a shock wave acceleration model based on the acceleration of cosmic ray particles by the shock wave front @xcite , a diffusive propagation model based on the leakage and diffusive propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy @xcite . an interaction model based on the interaction of cosmic rays with the background particles in the galaxy @xcite , a reaction model based on the reaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere of earth @xcite , etc . among these models",
    ", the shock wave acceleration model seems to be widely accepted as the explanation for the knee .",
    "however , the diffusive propagation model can provide the exposition for the first knee and the second knee and for the observed compositions and anisotropies @xcite .",
    "the diffusive propagation model is characterized by introducing the particle hall drift effect ; thus , it is a theoretically simple model .    in this study , we derived solutions for the diffusive propagation model of cosmic rays and confirmed the validity of this model .",
    "we adopted the semi - empirical diffusion equation introduced in @xcite and the diffusion tensor described in @xcite .",
    "then , we extended the propagation model in @xcite to a two - dimensional two - layer ( comprising the galactic disk and the halo ) model in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ solution ] , we derive the analytical solutions for the diffusion equation of cosmic rays . in section [ psols ] , we qualitatively show that our model can explain the spectral feature of the observed cosmic rays , namely , the exponential variation around the knee . in section",
    "[ conclusion ] , we present the conclusions of our study .",
    "fig . [ gstructure ] shows a schematic diagram of our galactic model .",
    "we assume that our galaxy has a cylindrical structure and it is divided into two parts ; the galactic disk ( @xmath4 ) and the halo ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the signs @xmath6 and @xmath7 indicate the direction along the @xmath8-axis . in fig .",
    "[ gstructure ] , @xmath9 is the radius of the galaxy and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the height of the disk region and the galaxy , respectively .    ]    we suppose that the source of cosmic rays is distributed uniformly within the galactic disk area only .",
    "the source region of the @xmath12-th particle is given by radius @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) in the shaded area in fig .",
    "[ gstructure ] .",
    "we consider the following transport equation @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number density of the @xmath12-th cosmic ray component per unit time , unit volume , and unit energy ; @xmath17 is the diffusion tensor ( indexes @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the coordinates ) ; @xmath20 is the velocity of the cosmic ray ; @xmath21 is the inelastic scattering cross - section between the @xmath12-th cosmic ray particle and the interstellar gas ; @xmath22 is the density of the interstellar gas ; and @xmath23 represents the distribution of the source .",
    "we adopt the diffusion tensor given in @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the unit vector of the magnetic field , @xmath26 denotes the diffusion along the magnetic field line , @xmath27 denotes the diffusion perpendicular to the magnetic field line , @xmath28 is diffusion due to the antisymmetric drift of the particle , @xmath29 is the kronecker s delta symbol , and @xmath30 is the complete antisymmetric levi - civita tensor .",
    "the observed data show that the magnetic field in the galaxy has a spiral structure , and it is regarded as an approximate toroidal structure @xcite .",
    "thus , we assume the unit vector of the magnetic field as @xmath31 it should be noted that the magnetic field line in the galactic disk changes the sign almost every 3 kpc along the radial direction @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the global magnetic field points in the same direction anywhere in the galactic disk .",
    "on the other hand , the structure of the magnetic field in the galactic halo is not well known ; so we suppose that the magnetic field in the halo also has a toroidal structure given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the disk and the halo , respectively . from eq .",
    "( [ uvector2 ] ) , the diffusion terms in ( [ diff - eq2 ] ) becomes @xmath35 these coefficients are determined in @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xmath36 is related to the kolmogolov turbulence spectrum ; @xmath37 , turbulence spectrum of kraichinan hydromagnetic one @xcite ; and @xmath38 , bykov - toptygin spectrum @xcite . in the case of the halo",
    ", we do not have sufficient knowledge about the magnetic turbulence ; therefore , we assume that the same power law holds ] as @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the mean free path that is characterized by the turbulent exponent @xmath41 , @xmath42 denotes the relative value of a random magnetic field within the characteristic scale @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is a not well - determined parameter ( see @xcite ) . from the gyro - radius @xmath45",
    "we obtain the drift velocity of the particles @xmath46 then , we substitute the coefficients of the diffusion tensor given in @xcite @xmath47 then the diffusion term reduces to @xmath48 from eq .",
    "( [ coeff ] ) , the drift velocity @xmath49 is written as @xmath50 thus , the drift effect appears only along the @xmath8-direction in this case .",
    "let us summarize the boundary and continuity conditions .",
    "first , at the edge of the galaxy , we assume that the cosmic rays leak from the galaxy @xmath51 this condition seems to be appropriate in terms of the cosmic ray @xmath52 ratio .",
    "second , at the boundaries of the disk and the halo , @xmath53 , both @xmath54 and @xmath55 must be continuously connected .",
    "then , @xmath56 and @xmath57      because eq .",
    "( [ diff - eq2 ] ) has the same form as eqs .",
    "( 3.10 ) or ( 3.11 ) in @xcite , we follow the same approach . to obtain the solution for eq .",
    "( [ diff - eq2 ] ) , we first obtain the green s function @xmath58 , which satisfies @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents the position of the cosmic ray source and @xmath61 is the step function .",
    "@xmath58 is related to @xmath62 in @xcite : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the constant characterizing the @xmath12-th particle , @xmath65 represents the radial distribution of the source of cosmic rays , and we presume the energy spectrum at the source obeys the power law @xmath66 for the @xmath12-th particle . we also suppose the radial component of @xmath58 is expanded by using the zeroth - order bessel function @xmath67 in this expression , @xmath68 is the @xmath69-th root of the equation @xmath70 .",
    "hence , eq .
