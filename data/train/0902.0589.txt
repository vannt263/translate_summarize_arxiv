    "multi - wavelength observations show that most solar eruptive events ( flares and coronal mass ejections : cmes ) are associated with magnetic fields with complex topologies ( twist , shear , writhe , and linking ; see * ? ? ?",
    "hence , numerous recent studies were dedicated to characterize the formation of solar filaments and their eruptive evolution into cmes .",
    "resolving the magnetic structure of these phenomena is therefore important to constrain models ( see * ? ? ?",

    "[ hinode_sotfg ] displays a los - photospheric magnetogram from sot - fg of the active region .",
    "the magnetic structure extends between the triangle symbols that mark approximately the locations of its footpoints .",
    "the loop - system ends are rooted into pores and plage areas with opposite dominant polarities , where relatively important changes of the flux were occurring ( see right panel of fig .  [ hinode_sotfg ] ) .",
    "the goes non - eruptive , c - class flare took place near the northeast footpoint ( see fig .",
    "[ hinodexrt]a ) .",
    "the full extend of the magnetic thread system is revealed by emissions of high temperature spectral lines observed by eis ( fe   255.1   : @xmath2 ; ca   192.82   : @xmath3 ) at about 2:46 ut . the loop topology in eis data is similar to the x - ray one recorded about 15 - 20 minutes after the flare ( fig .  [ hinodexrt ] ) with , however , a better contrast .",
    "it is noteworthy that emissions in low temperature lines did not show similar features .",
    "x - ray data also show that the structure had an apparent simpler topology prior to the flare .",

    "the arrangement of the threads is better seen around 3:30 ut and show similarities with eis and xrt observations .",
    "the sequential appearances of the suggested flux rope in hot emission lines ( e.g. , fe   225.1   , @xmath2 ) , then in x - ray images ( a few mk ) , and finally in euv 171   and 195   images ( @xmath4  mk ) show different cooling stages of the magnetic structure and display details of its fine structure .",

    "we believe this is a segment of the larger , inverse s - shaped filament structure .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that the topology of the different threads indicates a high degree of linking suggesting the presence of a twisted flux rope ( see fig .",
    "[ secchi_euvia]b - c ) .",
    "the presence of dark fibrils indicates that magnetic structure may have been present prior to the goes c - class flare .",
    "these were , however , of filamentary nature and evolving rapidly with time .",
    "it is likely that the flux tube emerged twisted from the convection zone .",
    "photospheric shear motions and helicity transfer during the flare may also contribute to the twist of the flux tube .",
    "since the flare is non - eruptive , the helicity of the flaring system is likely to be evacuated to neighboring flux tube by increasing their topological complexity .",
    "the presence of helical structures during filament eruptions is well established by observations .",
    "however , their role in the formation of solar filaments and also their occurrence prior to the eruptive phase of cmes are still highly debated .",
    "two classes of models are proposed to address these questions .",
    "the first class is flux rope based models , which consider highly twisted flux tubes to be at the origin of solar filaments @xcite .",
    "the second class considers highly sheared arcades along magnetic inversion lines to be the base of the filament , where the helical structure occurs only during the eruptive phase of the filament and that is the result of the ongoing magnetic reconnection @xcite . although the present observations are not meant to discriminate between the two types of models , they indicate the presence of a flux rope prior to the filament formation that lasted for several days .",
    "we believe that it favors the flux - rope based models . for more details see @xcite ."
