    "the problem is that the partition of energy amongst the loops that comprise the arcade that forms along the flare ribbon has not been determined to date .",
    "flare energy release undoubtedly occurs across many magnetic threads , as has been known for a long time ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite presented an analysis of a large flare occurring across more than 100 loops , to infer cooling times across a well - observed arcade .",
    "_ yohkoh _",
    "observations pointed to a temperature gradient in the arcade , where the outermost loops are the hottest @xcite . tracing the motion of hard x - ray ( hxr ) sources , @xcite showed that as a disturbance propagates along the arcade , it triggers reconnection and particle acceleration in successive loops as it proceeds , thus heating the loops sequentially .",
    "multi - threaded models have been employed by a number of authors to study solar flares .",
    "@xcite adopted a multi - stranded model to explain the observation of stationary ca19 emission during the impulsive phase of many flares , when single loop models consistently predicted strong blue - shifts .",
    "similarly , @xcite developed a multi - threaded model to show that _ trace _  and _ yohkoh _  light - curves were more readily explained by an arcade rather than a single loop .",
    "@xcite derived an algorithm to compute energy inputs for successive threads comprising a flare , by calculating the discrepancy between the observed and calculated goes flux .",
    "they showed that the absence of strongly blue - shifted ca19 emission in _ yohkoh _",
    "observations is because that emission is masked by previously heated threads .",
    "@xcite studied the duration of heating on successive threads , concluding that short heating time scales lead to significantly higher temperatures , inconsistent with _",

    "@xcite compared one and two - dimensional models of a flare to find that the observed dynamics were better reproduced by their 2d model , which approximated a multi - stranded model . on the other hand , @xcite found that while a single loop model can reproduce high temperature evaporation flows , there were numerous discrepancies between the observed and modeled cooler , red - shifted lines .",
    "recently , @xcite , using the 0d model ebtel @xcite , studied the cooling phase of flares with a multi - threaded model , and only found consistency with euv emission if there is prolonged gradual phase heating occurring on many threads .    in the first paper ( @xcite , hereafter paper slowromancap1@ )",

    "the combination of instruments allows coverage across a wide temperature range , from the chromosphere through the transition region ( tr ) and upper corona , to temperatures exceeding 10 mk .",
    "the unique perspective allowed us to measure temperatures , emission measures ( ems ) , non - thermal electron beam parameters , energy input , and individual tr brightenings at high cadence and spatial resolution .    in paper slowromancap1@ , we presented observations of si4 and c2 as seen by _ iris _ , both of which brightened during the rise phase along with the hxr emission measured with _ rhessi_. the two lines were red - shifted during that time period , and remained red - shifted even after the impulsive phase , gradually decreasing in magnitude over time - scales exceeding 20 minutes at some positions .",

    "we seek to explain the persistent red - shifts by developing a model which requires a partition of energy amongst the magnetic strands comprising the flare . in section [ sec : modeling ] , we describe the hydrodynamic code used to model this flare .",
    "we then split up the results in section [ sec : results ] into two parts : a simple model ( both single loop and multi - threaded loop ) and a multi - threaded monte carlo simulation . we finally discuss the implications and conclusions of this work in section [ sec : implications ] .",
    "we have run hydrodynamic simulations with the hydrodynamics and radiation code ( hydrad ; @xcite ) in order to study potential heating mechanisms .",
    "the code solves the one - dimensional hydrodynamic equations , conservation of mass , momentum , and energy , applicable to a two - fluid plasma confined to a magnetic flux tube rooted beneath the surface and extending into the corona .",
    "the energy equations include terms for thermal conduction , enthalpy flux , small - scale electric fields , viscosity , gravity , inter - species collisions , and radiation .",
    "a key strength of the hydrad code is its speed and portability . in this paper , we present a total of 45 simulations , each for 1,000 seconds of simulation time with highly resolved grids and a wide parameter space .",
    "all of the simulations were performed on a desktop computer , with up to 8 running simultaneously .    because the corona is a low @xmath1 plasma @xcite , cross - field conduction is negligible @xcite , and the fields are frozen - in @xcite , each coronal loop may be treated as an isolated structure , with no interaction between adjacent loops .",
    "we assume each thread is semi - circular in shape , oriented vertically from the solar surface , with constant cross - section from foot - point to apex .",
    "we treat radiative losses in the corona and tr with a full calculation of losses with chianti v.8 @xcite , via the equation ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number density , @xmath4 the abundance of element @xmath5 relative to hydrogen , @xmath6 the emissivity of all lines from ion @xmath7 of element @xmath5 , and @xmath8 the population fraction of ion @xmath7 .",
    "we solve a continuity equation for non - equilibrium ionization states of hydrogen , carbon , oxygen , silicon , and iron in the work here @xcite , as non - equilibrium ionization is expected to be significant during impulsive bursts of heating .",
    "further , because hydrogen may not be ionized in the chromosphere , collisions and thermal conduction due to neutrals are included in the code @xcite .",
    "we treat optically thick radiation in the chromosphere with the recipes of @xcite .",
    "we adopt the photospheric abundances of @xcite as some recent evidence indicates that flares are photospheric in composition @xcite , although there is also evidence to the contrary @xcite .",
    "we have assumed that the loop is heated by an electron beam under the collisional thick - target model @xcite , where accelerated electrons stream through the corona , depositing their energy through collisions with chromospheric plasma .",
    "we have treated heating by an electron beam using the model of @xcite , with the details of the implementation described in @xcite .",
    "we assume an electron beam distribution of the form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the beam energy flux ( ergsec@xmath11@xmath12 ) , @xmath13 is the low energy cut - off ( kev ) , @xmath14 is the spectral index , and @xmath15 is the initial kinetic energy of a given electron ( kev ) .",
    "this distribution , referred to as a sharp cut - off , is commonly assumed and allows for easy comparison to measured _ rhessi _  data .",
    "we use the actual _ rhessi _  parameters in the model when available , although in section [ subsec : montecarlo ] we treat the energy input for a given loop as randomly selected on a power - law distribution , as described in that section .    with _ rhessi",

    "the power carried by the electron beam gradually increases , though it stays around @xmath16ergs@xmath11 .",
    "a cross - sectional area @xmath17 must be measured ( or assumed ) to determine the energy flux @xmath18 .",
    "the spectral index @xmath14 gradually increases , but is approximately @xmath19 at most times ( slightly lower than the median value for a microflare , @xcite ) .",
    "the cut - off energy @xmath13 is approximately @xmath20kev for the entire duration ( compared to a median of @xmath21kev in microflares , @xcite ) .        from these simulations , we forward model spectral lines as might be seen by _ iris _ , following the methodology of @xcite , using the _ iris _  response functions calculated with solarsoft . in this work",
    "we focus on the si4 1402.770   and c2 1334.535   lines , which are useful diagnostics of heat transport to the lower atmosphere ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , and strongly correlated with energy input @xcite .",
    "in paper slowromancap1@ , we presented detailed observations of sol2014 - 11 - 19t14:25ut , a small flare which was observed simultaneously by _ iris _ , _ rhessi _ , and _ hinode_. the si4 emission along the slit shows distinct brightenings ( typically lasting less than 60s ) between 14:15 and 14:25 , at which times the line profile is red - shifted to @xmath22kms@xmath11 .",
    "after these brightenings , however , the red - shifts persist , remaining greater than @xmath23 km s@xmath11 for more than 30 minutes , gradually declining .",
    "emission from c2 is similar ( see paper slowromancap1@ ) . in this section ,",
    "we focus on reproducing long - lasted red - shifts , while simultaneously remaining within the constraints given by the other instruments ( temperature , density , em , power ) .",
    "we first attempted to model this event with a single loop , on which seven heating bursts occurred ( based on the number of observed si4 brightenings during the peak intensity ) .",
    "we also attempted to model this event using a multi - threaded loop composed of seven strands , on each of which one heating burst occurred . in both cases",
    ", we use the observationally measured cut - off energy @xmath24kev and spectral index @xmath25 , with a maximum beam flux of @xmath26ergs@xmath11@xmath12 ( above the explosive threshold for this cut - off , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : simulated_si4 ] shows synthesized si4 emission for the two cases . on the left hand side , the plots show a single loop modeled with seven distinct bursts of heating , while the right hand shows a simulation with seven threads each with one heating burst .",
    "the top plots show the si4 intensity as a function of time for 15 minutes while the bottom plots show the doppler shifts of the line ( fit with a single gaussian ) .",
    "there is an obvious discrepancy between these simulations and the observations .",
    "first , the intensity in the single thread case is more or less constant after the initial heating event , and there are distinct intensity bursts at each heating burst in the multi - threaded case . in the observations",
    ", however , the si4 intensity sharply brightens during the rise phase , with a few local maxima , and then very gradually decays .",
    "second , in the monolithic loop simulation , the doppler velocity shows only a single strong red - shift at the time of the first heating burst , while the multi - threaded simulation shows seven strong red - shifts , corresponding to a heating event on each thread ( which may be more akin to the red - shifts seen by @xcite ) .",
    "the observations , however , show a nearly constant red - shift of @xmath27kms@xmath11 , with weak spikes in the velocity when the intensity spikes , which neither simulation reproduces .",
    "the quick decay of red - shifts in the simulations is straight - forward to explain .",
    "the heating burst quickly heats the chromosphere to coronal temperatures , which then drives energy down through the transition region , forcing a flow of material downward . as the material proceeds to greater depths , the local density increases , causing a loss of momentum and a quick dissipation of the bulk flows .",
    "further , in the monolithic simulation , once evaporation brings material into the corona , later heating bursts can not cause a strong velocity flow due to the increased inertia . in the multi - threaded simulation , each loop shows a strong red - shift at the time of a heating burst , as material is pushed downward . in both cases ,",
    "the down - flows quickly dissipate in the span of @xmath282030s .",
    "@xcite analytically derived this quick decay of condensation flows , showing that , at most , they last for 4560s , which is independent of the heating duration ( although that does not imply that emission in the same spectral line lasts that long , so it is effectively an upper limit ) .",
    "the observed values are irreconcilable with these simulations .",
    "a persistent down - flow of @xmath27kms@xmath11 can not be explained by constant heating , or with any number of heating bursts on a single loop .",
    "a multi - threaded model could be consistent if the number of threads were significantly higher ( @xmath29 ) than what we have assumed , as we will show in the next section .",
    "the inadequacy of a simple model highlights the complexity of the event . neither a single loop model nor a simple multi - threaded model with a small number of threads produces emission consistent with the observed values .",
    "thanks to the wealth of observations available during this event , we can constrain the parameters of the model more thoroughly and produce a more realistic model . the first major consideration",
    "is that there must have been a very large number of strands comprising the emission _ within a single _ iris _",
    "pixel_.    the _ rhessi _",
    "observations indicate the presence of an electron beam with mean values of low energy cut - off @xmath24kev , spectral index @xmath30 , and power input @xmath31ergs@xmath11 , which we take as inputs to the model .",
    "it is clear both observationally and from the modeling that a single loop model is insufficient , however , and in a multi - threaded model the power must be divided among many threads comprising an arcade .",
    "_ rhessi _  does not have the spatial resolution nor the cadence necessary to determine that distribution .",
    "since the hxr emission is cospatial to and strongly correlated with the intensity of tr lines ( e.g. paper slowromancap1@ , @xcite ) , we use the intensity distribution of si4 emission measured with _ iris _  to estimate this distribution of energy carried by the electron beam to various threads .    in paper slowromancap1@",
    ", we presented a histogram of _ iris _  1400   intensities at various times , that were fit to a power law .",
    "the slope @xmath32 was determined to be @xmath0 at most times , ranging from about @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "we therefore assume that the intensity distribution is correlated with the energy flux carried by the electron beam on each thread , thus composing a power - law of beam fluxes .",
    "although the correlation between tr lines and hxr emission is well established at the large scale , both spatially and temporally , future hxr instrumentation ( _ e.g. _ _ foxsi _ , @xcite ) should verify that this remains true at smaller scales .",
    "we have run 37 simulations with hydrad , adopting electron beam heating with @xmath35kev , @xmath36 ( the average values measured with _ rhessi _ ) , and beam flux ranging from @xmath37ergs@xmath11@xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the heating lasts for 10 seconds on each thread , with a flat temporal envelope .",
    "we then calculate the si4 and c2 emission from each simulation along the loop at all times , using the _ iris _  response function .    from this set of simulations , on a power - law distribution with slope @xmath38 , varying in time as measured with _ iris _ , we then randomly sample @xmath39 total threads to comprise the emission ( threads can be used more than once ) .",
    "we allow these threads to occur randomly at an average rate of 1 per @xmath40 unit time ( _ i.e. _ on a poisson distribution with average waiting time @xmath40 ) , and assume @xmath41s in order to last through the period under consideration ( approximately 14:14 - 14:24 ut ) .",
    "we then sum the emission from all @xmath39 threads to calculate a light - curve and line profile at all times as if they were all contained in the same _ iris _  pixel , and then fit the profiles to calculate the doppler velocity as a function of time .",
    "we present the intensities and velocities at both 1 and 8 second integration times in order to compare directly with the observations ( 8 second integration ) and with what might be seen by a faster instrument .",
    "since the cross - sectional area of an individual strand is unknown and necessary to calculate line intensities , we assume the pixel area is divided evenly among the @xmath39 strands , and additionally assume a filling factor of 1 .",
    "there are many variables at play that can not be directly measured , despite the abundance of instruments that observed the event : the number of threads comprising the emission @xmath39 , the rate of heating bursts onto these threads @xmath40 , the minimum and maximum sizes of energy release , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( if any ) .",
    "we discuss ways to constrain these variables in this section .",
    "first , consider the maximum size of the heating rate . if that maximum is too small , the lines are generally blue - shifted , as in figure [ fig : low_energy ] .",
    "we have limited the power - law to the range of energy flux @xmath44ergs@xmath11@xmath12 .",
    "we show the emission calculated with @xmath45 total threads and @xmath46 seconds average waiting time . the top plot shows the intensity of si4 as a function of time , where the black dotted line shows a 1-second integration time and the red 8-second .",
    "the bottom plot shows the calculated doppler shifts , based on fitting a single gaussian to the profiles , where we have defined red - shifted flows to be positive .",
    "the line is , on average , weakly blue - shifted during the heating period ( _ cf . _",
    "@xcite ) , which was not observed during the event ( see paper slowromancap1@ ) .",
    "it is clear that there must have been events with energy flux such that @xmath47ergs@xmath11@xmath12 .",
    "the top plot shows the calculated intensity , and the bottom the doppler shift .",
    "red - shifts are defined as positive velocities .",
    "the line was calculated with integration times of one ( black dotted ) and eight seconds ( red dashed ) , compared to the eight second integration time used with _ iris _  in paper slowromancap1@.",
    "note the absence of significant red - shifts.,width=316 ]    figure [ fig : all_energies ] shows the calculated light - curves in the case where the power - law extends from @xmath37ergs@xmath11@xmath12 for @xmath45 threads and @xmath46s per thread . at energy fluxes less than @xmath48ergs@xmath11@xmath12 ,",
    "there is little to no heating so that only minimal emission would result , while energy fluxes greater than @xmath49ergs@xmath11@xmath12 are so rare that we can discount them in general . in this case",
    ", the stronger events quickly produce a red - shift in both lines as the chromosphere quickly heats to tr temperatures .",
    "the stronger events also produce considerably higher intensities in both spectral lines , so that the emission is weighted heavily by them , despite being less common overall .",
    "the net result is that the intensities are markedly more bursty in nature due to large events rising above the background of weak events , and that the calculated doppler shift is weakly red - shifted in both lines when the intensity is high .",
    "however , the velocities are not persistent over the period of heating , as in the observations .",
    "there are two possible explanations : that the assumed minimum energy release is too low ( @xmath50ergs@xmath11@xmath12 ) or that the assumed spacing between events is too large ( @xmath51s per thread ) .",
    "we examine both of these possibilities .",
    "ergs@xmath11@xmath12 , otherwise as before .",
    "the red - shifts are bursty and short - lived , in stark contrast to the observations.,width=316 ]    we now consider the minimum energy flux . in figure",
    "[ fig : minimum ] , we show synthesized si4 emission and doppler shifts for the cases where the minimum energy flux is taken to be @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath26ergs@xmath11@xmath12 , with @xmath45 and @xmath46s , which also can be compared with the previous figure . for @xmath54ergs@xmath11@xmath12 , there are sharp drops in the red - shift , which were not observed , while above that value , the red - shifts remain at around 30kms@xmath11 for the duration of the heating events .",
    "this minimum beam flux corresponds roughly to the transition between gentle and explosive evaporation flows for the cut - off used here ( see section 5 of @xcite ) , suggesting that the majority of the threads were heated explosively",
    ".                one might ask whether the persistent red - shifts might also be explained by simply increasing the rapidity with which new threads are energized .",
    "in figure [ fig : r ] , we show three plots , two where @xmath55ergs@xmath11@xmath12 , but now @xmath40 has been decreased to 1 and 3s per thread , and one where @xmath56ergs@xmath11@xmath12 , with @xmath57s per thread . in all three of these cases ,",
    "we see that the red - shifts have sharp drops toward 0 , either due to the weighting of the weaker heating events or the quick decay of red - shifts on the individual threads",
    ". however , we can deduce that : 1 .",
    "@xmath58s per thread , that is , new threads are energized at a rate faster than one per 10 seconds on average , 2 .",
    "@xmath59s , so @xmath60 threads must have been energized during the hxr burst , and 3",
    ". the rate of energization @xmath40 alone can not explain persistent red - shifts , there must also be a minimum energy flux in general .",
    "there is one caveat to mention , though , in that a constant low - energy cut - off was assumed on each thread , which can not be verified with _ rhessi _ , although the parameter strongly affects flow speeds @xcite .",
    "the synthesized emission appears consistent with the observed values , given the constraints discussed above .",
    "however , an important check on the model is to synthesize other observables to find if it is well bounded by them .",
    "can the model simultaneously reproduce the _ iris _  velocities , the em distribution found with _ eis _ , _ xrt _ , and _ aia _ , and the density constraint found with",
    "how do the line profiles compare to those found in paper slowromancap1@ ?",

    "figure [ fig : other_params ] shows the line profiles and light - curves for si4 and c2 , the emission measure per area ( defined as @xmath62 , where we have integrated over 1 arcsec near the apices of the loops ) , and finally the density sensitive line ratio fe14 @xmath63  as might be seen by _ eis _  near the foot - point ( the red data point denotes the observed ratio ) .",
    "the observed line profiles in paper slowromancap1@ can be compared with those calculated here .",
    "importantly , at most times , both lines show a bright red - shifted component , with a much weaker stationary component ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "this compares favorably with the observed si4 profiles , although the stationary component of c2 is smaller than that observed ( figure 9 of paper slowromancap1@ ) .",
    "the c2 line likely requires a full radiative transfer calculation to reproduce accurately ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , as it forms in the upper chromosphere or base of the tr , whereas the contribution function in chianti cuts off below @xmath65k .",
    "the forward model only considers thermal broadening in determining line widths , and in general both spectral lines are thinner than the observed ones , suggesting that another broadening mechanism contributes to the observed values .",
    "the density measured from the fe14 ratio is slightly lower than that observed , but within the error bars .",
    "no significant trend was found between the number of threads @xmath39 and the calculated ratio , although higher minimum flux values increase the ratio , in general .",
    "the line ratio oscillates more for smaller number of threads , although the cadence of the _ eis _  raster is too slow to draw any conclusions from this .",
    "the emission measure distribution ( emd , e.g. @xcite ) reveals a good deal about the dynamics .",
    "the maximum temperature in the loops tends to decrease with time - peaking at about 15 , 10 , 8 , 6 , and 5 mk at the times shown .",
    "a line was fit to the cool - ward side of the em from its peak value down to log @xmath66 , as done in paper slowromancap1@ , with temperature bins of 0.1 d @xmath67 .",
    "the slopes of those lines steepen during the heating period gradually , since the hottest material dominates the emission during this time , and then become shallower as the loops cool after the heating ceases , as might be expected . at 500 seconds , the calculated slope is about @xmath68 which is intermediate to the observed values measured with _ aia _  and _ xrt _ @xmath69 at ut14:22:49 , and that found with _ eis _ , @xmath70 ( see figure 13 of paper slowromancap1@ ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : em ] , we show the emd calculated for @xmath71s per thread , which can be compared with the previous emd plot .",
    "there is no clear trend in the slopes for varying values of @xmath40 , despite what may be expected , which is likely due to the randomized energy and timing of individual threads .",
    "however , for smaller values of @xmath40 , where the number of threads @xmath39 is much larger , there is more emission at lower temperatures than in the case of _",

    "in paper slowromancap1@ , we presented observations of the flare sol2014 - 11 - 19t14:25ut , which was observed with many different instruments , covering a wide range of energies and temperatures . observed red - shifts in the si4 1402.770   and c2 1334.535   lines persisted for longer than 30 minutes , which is difficult to reconcile with simple theoretical models .",
    "specifically , @xcite showed that condensation flows persist for about @xmath75 seconds , regardless of the strength or duration of heating .",

    "the two oxygen lines gradually transitioned into down - flows that lasted for half an hour , while the mg10 line was found to be composed of a strong stationary component and a weaker red wing , and fe19 remained stationary thereafter . those red - wing components , termed `` warm rain '' , were interpreted as signatures of the cooling and draining of a loop , and lasted for half an hour or so after the flare s onset",
    ".    however , the event studied here differs in a few important respects .",
    "first , there were no signatures of blue - shifts in the tr lines during the impulsive phase .",
    "si4 was fully red - shifted for the duration of the event ( figure 9 of paper slowromancap1@ ) , in contrast to the behavior of the oxygen lines reported in @xcite .",
    "second , there is insufficient time for the loops to drain .",
    "the red - shifts begin simultaneously with the hxr burst , suggesting that they are signatures of chromospheric condensation as the energy is deposited by electron beams . after heating ceases on a given coronal loop",
    ", there is a long time period during which the coronal density does not drain significantly , and energy losses are first dominated by thermal conduction , then by radiation , and only then by an enthalpy flux ( see the thorough treatment by @xcite ) .",
    "the time scales for coronal loops to cool and drain were derived analytically and checked numerically by @xcite , and typically are on the order of 45 minutes to an hour . finally , the cooling between successive _ aia",
    "_  channels often seen in flares ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) was seen in the coronal section of the loops , with a cooling time - scale of about 40 minutes , suggesting they did not drain significantly for nearly as long .    in this paper , by adopting a multi - threaded model , we have shown that these observations are consistent with a power - law distribution of heating occurring on a very large number of threads .",
    "the following important conclusions can be drawn from the work here .    1 .",

    "the single loop model is woefully inadequate to explain the intensities or doppler shifts observed in this event , regardless of the number of heating events on the loop or duration of heating .",
    "a simple multi - stranded model of 7 loops similarly fails , as the observed doppler shifts are essentially continuous , not single discrete events .",
    "however , a multi - stranded loop model as presented in section [ subsec : montecarlo ] captures many of the observed properties of the _ iris _  emission , while being within the bounds of the observed density , temperature , and emission measure .",
    "compare the conclusions of many prior multi - threaded studies , _",
    "@xcite , etc .",
    "* energy partition among strands . *",
    "we measured the distribution of _ iris _  sji intensities to be well described by a power - law , with slope @xmath76 at most times ( see paper slowromancap1@ for details ) .",
    "since the intensities of many tr lines are proportional , both spatially and temporally , to the hxr intensities ( paper slowromancap1@ , @xcite ) , and since the energy flux of the electrons is proportional to the non - thermal hxr intensity @xcite , we take this distribution as a proxy for the partition of energy among the threads . this distribution over a large number of threads produces _ iris _",
    "si4 and c2 intensities and doppler shifts that are consistent with values measured in paper slowromancap1@. in future work , we will examine this distribution for more events of varying _ goes _  class to determine statistical trends and properties .",
    "3 .   * resolving loop structures .",
    "* it does not seem possible to explain the observed red - shifts with a single loop model , or with a small number of strands .",
    "further , the background level of emission does not strongly show doppler shifts ( blue or red ) , and the shifts correspond to brightenings above background emission so that the red - shifts must be a signature of the flare itself . as the red - shifts were measured in single pixels , then",
    ", we conclude that there is loop structure not being resolved at the sub - pixel level of _",
    "iris_. in order to maintain a red - shift in these lines without sharp drops in the speed , threads must be energized at a rate @xmath58s per thread , giving a lower limit on the number of threads @xmath60 _ rooted within a single _ iris _  pixel _ for the duration of the hxr burst . for the duration of the entire event",
    ", this number must be appropriately increased . in comparison",
    ", @xcite estimated a rate of @xmath77s per thread ( total of 120 threads during the impulsive phase ) over the entire reconnection region of a small c2.6 flare .",
    "their analysis was based on the released non - thermal energy , and constitutes a lower bound . +",
    "what is the size , then , of an individual strand ?",
    "if the iris pixel were divided evenly between strands , then the diameter is on the order of @xmath78arcsec or less , significantly smaller than previous suggestions .",
    "this may provide evidence for the fractal model of reconnection in flares @xcite , where the current sheet becomes exceedingly thin due to the secondary tearing instability @xcite .",
    "4 .   * beam energy flux constraints . *",
    "_ rhessi _  measures the power contained in the electron beam integrated over the entire foot - point , which can then be divided by an area to give an estimate of the beam energy flux . however , since it is integrated over the entire foot - point , that does not specify what the flux was on the many threads comprising that area .",
    "combined with the power - law distribution , we have constrained the maximum and minimum values of the flux .",
    "the cut - off energy during this event was measured at 11 - 13 kev for the duration of the hxr burst ( figure [ fig : rhessi_params ] ) . at that cut - off",
    ", the threshold between gentle and explosive evaporation is @xmath79ergs@xmath11@xmath12 @xcite . for lower beam fluxes ,",
    "the si4 line is in fact blue - shifted ( compare @xcite ) , which was never observed during this event .",
    "we therefore can reasonably conclude that the maximum beam flux must be greater than this value . what s more , since small events are far more likely on a power - law distribution of energies , they strongly weight the emission and often cause sharp drops in the measured doppler shift , so that it seems likely that the majority of the threads were heated explosively .",
    "this work has given a great deal of insight into the dynamics of this small flare .",
    "we have reasonably found a lower limit to the number of magnetic field threads , and have found the partition of energy among them , which allows us to build a realistic multi - threaded model .",
    "this model is well constrained by the abundance of observations from many different instruments , and can be applied to flares which do not have coverage as good as this one .",
    "there are still many areas of this work that can be improved to remove assumptions and generalize the model , however , such as determining how the electron beam parameters vary from thread to thread or finding an upper limit to the number of threads .",
    "it is also often true that si4 has a stronger stationary component in other flares than was seen in this one ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , so that further work may be required to determine whence the difference arises .",
    "we speculate that spectral lines seen in larger flares such as fe21 1354.08  may further improve our understanding of energy deposition between threads .",
    "the results of @xcite make it clear that the duration of condensation flows are insensitive to the heating strength and duration . however , evaporation flows are not limited in the same manner , and in fact there are indications that the flows last as long as the heating does ( _ e.g. _ the flows in figures 4 and 5 of @xcite or the fe21 shifts in @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , for this event , fe21 was not observed , and so no hard conclusions can yet be drawn regarding the heating durations .",
