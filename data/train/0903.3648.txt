    "factory experiments belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite , measurements of semileptonic decays to @xmath5 or @xmath6 mesons ( `` exclusive measurements '' ) and determinations of @xmath0 using all semileptonic final states in a given region of phase space ( `` inclusive measurements '' ) have been performed . in this article , we will review the latter approach . as experimental and theoretical systematics are different",
    ", consistency between exclusive and inclusive determinations of @xmath0 is crucial for our understanding .    after reviewing the theory of the determination of @xmath0 from inclusive @xmath2  decays",
    ", we will discuss the measurements ( mainly at the b  factories ) of the semileptonic branching fraction and other inclusive observables in @xmath7  decays that allow to determine the non - perturbative parameters that appear in the calculation of the semileptonic width .",
    "finally , we perform fits to different data sets to determine @xmath0 and the @xmath3-quark mass  @xmath4 .",
    "the semileptonic decay width @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath9 . measurements of the semileptonic @xmath2  branching fraction thus allow to determine @xmath0 , provided that the width can be calculated reliably .",
    "challenges are non - perturbative qcd contributions and experimental selections applied to the data . _",
    "e.g. _ , semileptonic decays can typically only be measured above a certain minimum lepton energy threshold .",
    "these calculations are performed in the frameworks of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and the operator production expansion ( ope )  @xcite .",
    "the result is an expansion in inverse powers of the @xmath3-quark mass , the leading order corresponding to the result obtained assuming unconfined quarks .",
    "a problem for the practical use of these formulae is that new , so - called heavy quark ( hq ) parameter appear at each order in @xmath10 .",
    "these non - perturbative quantities encode the soft qcd physics and can not be calculated from perturbation theory .    at present",
    ", there are two independent calculations of the semileptonic width performed up to the third order in @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "refering to the @xmath3-quark mass definition used , the two schemes are called 1s and kinetic . _",
    "e.g. _ , the result in the kinetic scheme reads  @xcite , @xmath11~ , \\label{eq:1}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the fermi constant , @xmath13 is the renormalization scale , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are phase space factors  @xcite .",
    "both the electroweak and the perturbative corrections , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are well known  @xcite .",
    "the remaining quantities are the above - mentioned hq parameters shown in table  [ tab:1 ] together with their counterparts in the 1s scheme .",
    ".heavy quark parameters in the expressions derived in the kinetic and 1s schemes . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ) . the @xmath19  contours are shown for the fit with and without @xmath20  data.,title=\"fig : \" ] + ) .",

    "we have reviewed the theory and surveyed the experimental data for the determination of the ckm matrix element @xmath0 from inclusive decays @xmath7 .",
    "the results for @xmath0 using the data of the belle experiment alone are given in table  [ tab:3 ] .",
    "also , an attempt is made to combine all available experimental data : the preliminary results in terms of @xmath0 and the @xmath3-quark mass @xmath4 are shown in table  [ tab:5 ] .",
