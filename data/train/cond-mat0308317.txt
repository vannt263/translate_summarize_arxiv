    "spin dynamics in semiconductor nanostructures have been studied intensively in recent years , motivated by the emerging field of semiconductor spintronics and quantum information processing.@xcite the most important time scale when implementing the quantum computer is the decoherence time of the quantum degree of freedom which is intended to be used as the qubit .",
    "typically the spin decoherence time in the bulk semiconductor material is extremely short .",
    "however , it is expected that the spin decoherence time should increase substantially in nanostructures due to the three - dimensional quantum confinement .",
    "this expectation is supported by the optical orientation experiments of gupta _ et al . _",
    "@xcite where a nano - second spin lifetime was measured for neutral cdse nanostructures .",
    "this indicates that there will be plenty of time to perform quantum operations on the spin degree of freedom in semiconductor nano structure before the coherence is lost .",
    "consequently spins in nanostructures are excellent candidates for qubits . on the other hand ,",
    "both spin based quantum computation and spintronics require precise control of the spin . since the control of the spin dynamics in nanostructures is strongly dependent on the g - factors of electrons , holes , and excitons in the nanostructure , it is imperative to understand the behavior and magnitude of g - factors .",
    "experimentally the g - factors of cdse nanocrystals with wurtzite lattice structure have been measured via time resolved faraday rotation ( trfr ) @xcite and magnetic circular dichroism ( mcd ) .",
    "@xcite the trfr experiment measurement reveals multiple g - factors .",
    "two or four distinct g - factor values are extracted , depending on the size of the nanostructure which ranges from 22 to 80   in diameter .",
    "the size distribution of the sample is about 5 - 15%.@xcite the sample from 22   to 57 has a size - dependent mean aspect ratio ranging from 1.0 to 1.3 , with a @xmath2 variation @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that when there are four distinct g - factors , these g - factors should be assigned to anisotropic electron and exciton g - factors .",
    "@xcite it has been speculated that there exists a quasispherical regime in which the g - factors become isotropic , hence reducing the number of distinct g - factors from four to two . on the other hand ,",
    "mcd measurements reveal only a single exciton g - factor for nanocrystals with 19   and 25   in diameter.@xcite it should be noted that the hole spin is also initially aligned by the optical pumping in a trfr experiment .",
    "it has been argued that the fast decoherence of the hole spin makes it impossible to detect the hole g - factor in trfr.@xcite although it is well established experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite that the hole spin decoherence time in the bulk semiconductor is extremely small , the three - dimensional quantum confinements might also alter significantly the hole spin decoherence time in the nanostructure . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there is neither experimental measurement nor theoretical estimation about the hole decoherence time in those nanostructures .",
    "recent time - resolved photoluminescence on inas / gaas quantum dots @xcite suggests that neither the electron nor the hole spin relax on the lifetime scale of the exciton in the system but no estimation of the hole relaxation time could be made .",
    "this suggests that a hole decoherence time becomes much longer in nanostructures .",
    "it is thus not yet clear whether the hole g - factor signature should appear in a trfr experiment .",
    "theoretically , the size dependence of the electron g - factor in cdse nanostructures has been calculated within the eight band kane model @xcite , and in the tight - binding model . @xcite in general ,",
    "the effective mass approximation ( ema ) type calculation is inadequate for nanostructures at small sizes ( @xmath3 30  ) because the atomic nature and surface effects become more prominent as the size of the nanostructure decreases .",
    "because of its atomic nature , the tight - binding model is ideal to study the electronic and optical properties of nanostructures in this size range .",
    "the time - independent tight - binding approach to calculation of g - factors in ref 14 is based on stone s formula @xcite which is derived form the double second order perturbation in terms of the spin - orbit interaction and the external magnetic field .",
    "the results obtained from this perturbative analysis show strong shape dependence . it was observed that a transition from anisotropic to isotropic g - factor tensor occurs at aspect ratio @xmath4 , resulting in a quasispherical regime , as originally suggested by rodina and coworkers .",
    "@xcite since the spin - orbit interaction is strong in cdse , ( @xmath5ev and @xmath6ev ) , it is desirable to include this non - perturbatively in order to get quantitative values .",
    "this not only provides a more accurate estimation of the electron g - factors for nanostructures with strong spin - orbit interaction , but will also enable us to treat the hole and exciton g - factors systematically , in addition to the electron g - factors . it is also intriguing to investigate the possibility of a quasispherical regime in more a quantitative calculations for the electron g - factor .",
    "in this paper we present such non - perturbative theoretical calculations of the electron and hole g - factors for cdse nanostructures employing the time - dependent empirical tight - binding theory . both the spin - orbit interaction and the external magnetic field",
    "are taken into account non - perturbatively .",
    "the g - factors are extracted from the magnetic field induced energy shifts of the electron and hole eigenvalues . the size and aspect ratio dependence of the resulting g - factors",
    "is investigated .",
    "we observe that the electron g - factors decrease monotonically as a function of size and are strongly anisotropic .",
    "the calculated values agree well with the experimental data from trfr .",
    "it will be shown that the electron g - factors can explain the trfr experimental data without invoking a exciton g - factor .",
    "the result also shows partial cancellation between the anisotropy deriving from the wurtzite structure and from the aspect ratio .",
    "the hole g - factors show very different behavior .",
    "they show marked oscillations as a function of the size .",
    "this is due to the size sensitive mixing between the heavy hole and light hole components .",
    "the exciton g - factor is not included in the current calculation . however the same calculation scheme can be easily extended to calculate the exciton g - factor with coulomb interactions included non - perturbatively . @xcite    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ theory ]",
    "we summarize the empirical tight - binding hamiltonian for cdse nanostructures and describe how to solve the model using a time - dependent approach . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our numerical results , including total density of states , band gap , and electron and hole g - factors . in section [ sum ]",
    "we draw several conclusions and discuss possible future directions .",
    "we start from the empirical tight - binding model for the bulk cdse semiconductor with an @xmath7 basis .",
    "the parameters we use for cdse are derived from the empirical parameters obtained by lippens and lannoo @xcite for the bulk cdse in the zinc - blende structure , assuming nearest - neighbor interactions only .",
    "we construct the cdse nanocrystals with wurtzite structure corresponding to the typical cdse nanostructures seen in tem images .",
    "@xcite the constructed structures have approximate but not exact @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "the same structures have been used in previous time - independent tight - binding studies . @xcite",
    "we remove the dangling bonds on the surface by shifting the energies of the corresponding hybrid orbitals well above the conduction band edge . the spin - orbit interaction is included in the hamiltonian .",
    "spin - orbit coupling constants are assigned to both types of atoms , with @xmath5ev and @xmath6ev respectively .",
    "@xcite in order to reproduce the a - b splitting within the @xmath7 basis , a crystal field of @xmath9 mev is added to the @xmath10 local orbitals .",
    "@xcite      instead of diagonalizing the tight - binding hamiltonian directly we employ the time - dependent approach which has been used previously to calculate electronic and excitonic properties of cdse nanocrystals with zinc - blende structure . @xcite in the following we will briefly describe the time - dependent tight - binding technique , indicate the differences compared with previous calculations , and show its advantage for calculation of g - factors .",
    "the time - dependent method depends primarily on the spectral decomposition for an arbitrary initial state .",
    "let @xmath11 be the complete set of eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian .",
    "any initial state @xmath12 can be expressed as the linear combination of the eigenfunctions @xmath13 the wavefunction at a later time @xmath14 is @xmath15 projecting the wavefunction at time @xmath14 onto the initial wavefunction and perform the fourier transform one finds @xmath16 thus the resulting fourier spectrum can give us the spectral weight of the initial state in the eigenfunction basis and the eigenenergies of the eigenstates , provided that the eigenstates have non - zero overlap with the initial state . to get the total density of states one can sum over the spectral decompositions obtained using each wavefunction in a complete set as the initial state in term .",
    "the natural and convenient complete set to choose in the tight - binding framework is the direct product set of all local site orbitals , atomic - orbitals , and spin states",
    ". then @xmath17 where @xmath18 . to achieve @xmath19-function resolution one would need to have the infinite length record of the correlation function @xmath20 . in practice",
    "only a finite length t of record is available , which gives rise to artificial sidebands around a broadened @xmath19-function approximation .",
    "the finite record length is taken into account by multiplying the right hand size of eq .",
    "( [ tdos_eq ] ) with the normalized hamming window function @xmath21,@xcite where    @xmath22    the window function will reduce the sidelobes of the broadened @xmath19-functions and generate a normalized peak height .",
    "the resulting spectrum is of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 represents the absolute spectral weight in eigenstate @xmath11 and the lineshape function @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 if the total wavefunction propagation time is @xmath27 , the energy resolution is @xmath28 .",
    "if the energy difference between the desired eigenenergy @xmath29 , and adjacent eigenenergies is larger than @xmath30 , the spectrum near energy @xmath29 can be approximately represented by @xmath31 with very high accuracy . assuming this form , the value of the eigenvalue can be determined with accuracy much higher than @xmath30 . to get the most accurate value possible",
    "it is desirable to perform the time integration of eq .",
    "( [ windowfunction ] ) by direct integration instead of using a discrete fourier transform .    in",
    "order to use the spectral method one must be able to calculate the time propagator @xmath32 efficiently . in order to accomplish this",
    "we first break the time propagator into a series of short time propagators @xmath33 with @xmath34 . for the short time",
    "propagator we make use of the baker - hausdorff formula@xcite expansion to obtain the expansion @xmath35 to implement this decomposition we first break the tight - binding hamiltonian into the on - site self - energy terms , the local spin - orbit terms , the local zeeman terms , and the hopping terms .",
    "the on - site spin - orbit interaction is diagonalized and exponentiated analytically in the basis of the tight - binding orbitals , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath36 matrix of the p - orbitals with spin . for the hopping terms we further use the checkerboard decomposition @xcite to divide these to different independent directions . note that in the zinc - blende structure there are only four fundamental directions while in the wurtzite structure there are seven fundamental directions . as a result of this decomposition each term contributing to the short time propagator",
    "can consequently be evaluated analytically @xcite and the time evolution of the state can be calculated very efficiently .",
    "the eigenfunction @xmath11 with eigenenergy @xmath29 can be calculated from @xmath37 .",
    "typically when there is no magnetic field @xmath38 , the initial state is taken as a uniform superposition of local orbitals with specific angular momentum index .",
    "the resultant eigenfunctions are then used as the starting point to calculate the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies when the magnetic field is turned on .    if there are degenerate eigenstates , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eigenstate ] ) will in general be some unknown linear combination of these eigenstates .",
    "however , if a set of exact or approximate quantum numbers which can be used to label the degenerate eigenstates are known in advance eigenfunctions corresponding to definite quantum numbers can be derived by judiciously choosing an initial state having the same quantum numbers .",
    "typically the angular momentum index is used in this work for this purpose .",
    "this property will be used to generate kramers doublets in our calculations .",
    "there are three important energy scales in this problem .",
    "the first energy scale is the energy difference between lowest conduction electron and higher energy conduction electrons and the difference between highest valence hole and lower energy hole states .",
    "this energy scale is typically at the order of 100 mev or larger .",
    "the second energy scale is the energy difference between nearly degenerate hole states that correspond approximately to the heavy hole and light hole states in the bulk limit .",
    "this energy scale is size dependent and is sensitive to the shape of the nanocrystals . in our calculation",
    "we find this energy scale to be 1 - 100 mev .",
    "the last important energy scale is the magnetic field induced splitting for a kramers doublet from which the g - factors are extracted .",
    "typically this energy scale ranges from couple of hundred @xmath39ev to several @xmath39ev .",
    "the maximal total propagation time is about 1280000 1/ev , resulting in an energy resolution of 2.5 @xmath39ev . in our calculation",
    "this energy resolution is enough to single out the spectrum of band edge electron and hole states from other higher energy states .",
    "it is also sufficient to resolve the two nearly degenerate hole states .",
    "once a high resolution eigenfunction is generated , by using window function eq .",
    "( [ hanning]-[windowfunction ] ) to suppress the contribution from adjacent eigenstates , the eigenenergies of band edge states can be determined with accuracy up to 1 @xmath39ev .",
    "it is important to clarify the definition and the sign convention for the g - factors , especially when these g - factors are anisotropic .",
    "when there is no external magnetic field kramers theorem guarantees that each eigenstate is at least two fold degenerate . in bulk cdse the heavy hole and light hole are degenerate at the @xmath40 point . in a cdse nanostructure",
    "it is expected that the quantum confinement will lift this degeneracy . in this work",
    "the g - factors will be defined with respect to the kramers doublet . for a kramers doublet",
    "the effective magnetic hamiltonian has the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the effective spin operator , which is defined with respect to the two kramer s states @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the @xmath45 g - factor tensor . in the kramers state basis",
    ", the effective spin operator @xmath42 has the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an integer chosen so that the real and effective spin are approximately equal .",
    "the @xmath44 tensor can be diagonalized in the principal axes .",
    "let @xmath48 , @xmath49 be the principal axes",
    ". then an external magnetic field @xmath50 will give rise to a zeeman splitting @xmath51 we will denote the values @xmath52 as principal g - factors .",
    "individual @xmath52 can be identified via varying external magnetic field along each of the principal directions and calculating the field dependent zeeman splitting .    in our calculation for cdse nanocrystal",
    "we find that the conduction electron is primarily s - like .",
    "in this case one can identify the effective spin operator with the real spin operator and give the g - factors a definite sign . by choosing the initial wavefunction to have a well defined real spin index ,",
    "the resultant eigenfunction will approximately have the corresponding effective spin index .    on the other hand , we find the hole to be primarily p - like .",
    "furthermore , there is a strong mixing between heavy hole and light hole component which is sensitive to the size and the shape of the nanostructures .",
    "it is thus difficulty to link the effective spin to the real spin , resulting in an ambiguity of the sign of the hole g - factors .",
    "in this situation it is more appropriate to express the zeeman splitting by the quadratic form @xmath53 in which the sign of principal g - factor is not well defined .",
    "typically the sign convention of the g - factor in the atomic and bulk limit can then be used as a convention to assign an definite sign to the g - factors in the nanostructure . in both cases there",
    "usually exists a simple relation between the effective spin operator and real spin operator , which enables us to determine the corresponding sign of the g - factor in the nanostructure .",
    "however there is a dearth for experimental results of electron , hole , and exciton g - factor in bulk cdse .",
    "hence it is difficult in this case to use bulk experimental results as a guide to determine the sign of the g - factors .    in order to assign the sign to the hole g - factors for cdse",
    "we therefore adopt the following scheme .",
    "the hole wavefunction will be calculated by propagating an initial state which has definite angular momentum index @xmath54 . the sign is then determined by whether the magnetic field induced energy shift is positive or negative .",
    "in the bulk limit this scheme will reproduce the heavy hole and light hole value correctly . in our calculation",
    "we find that the electron g - factor decreases as the size increases .",
    "this represents qualitatively the same trend as seen in effective mass type calculations@xcite for various semiconductor nanostructures . on the other hand the calculated hole g - factor for cdse shows oscillations , making correlation with the atomic and bulk limits more difficult .",
    "since in this work the g - factors will be determined via the energy splitting of the electron and hole states under the external magnetic field , it is critical to cast the tight - binding model into a gauge invariant form .",
    "we use the peierls - coupling tight - binding scheme to ensure the gauge invariance in our tight - binding model .",
    "@xcite in this scheme an electromagnetic field specified by the scalar potential @xmath55 and the vector potential @xmath56 will modify the on - site @xmath57 and off - site @xmath58 tight - binding parameters via    @xmath59    and @xmath60 where a straight line should be taken for the vector potential integral . in this calculation , the on - site intra - atomic dipole matrix elements @xmath61",
    "are set to zero .",
    "as pointed out by foreman @xcite , this choice ensures gauge invariance but can not correctly describe intra - atomic transitions in the atomic limit .",
    "however , predictive calculation of atomic transitions is not contained within empirical tight - binding treatment .",
    "previously , optical absorption spectra have been dealt with in tight - binding analysis by incorporating dipole matrix elements as extra fitting parameters . for cdse nanocrystals ,",
    "calculation of the bulk absorption spectrum has been found to be insensitive to the magnitude of the on - site dipole matrix elements,@xcite this provides some empirical justification for setting these matrix elements to zero in order to achieve gauge invariance .    for gauge - invariant correction",
    "we thus only need to modify the the hopping constant between nearest neighbors .",
    "since there are only seven independent hopping directions in a wurtzite structure the gauge phase can be calculated and stored before performing the time propagation .",
    "a brief summary of the gauge phase in the wurtzite structure is given in the appendix [ appendix-1 ] .    to estimate the contribution to the zeeman splitting from the gauge phase",
    ", we have calculated the zeeman splitting without gauge phase for some of the nanocrystals .",
    "we find that the gauge phase contributes 10 - 40% of the zeeman energy . without the gauge phase the zeeman splitting increases and",
    "becomes more isotropic .",
    "we investigate cdse nanostructures having 66 - 1501 atoms .",
    "this roughly corresponds to the size range of 15 - 43   in effective diameter . in our calculation",
    "we define the aspect ratio to be the ratio between effective in - plane diameter ( @xmath62 ) and out - of - plane diameter ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the aspect ratio of these nanostructures ranges from 0.68 to 1.64 .",
    "these can be divided into three different aspect ratio groups .",
    "the first group has aspect ratio well below one , ranging from 0.68 to 0.85 .",
    "the second group has aspect ratio approximately equal to one , ranging from 0.99 to 1.09 .",
    "the third group has aspect ratio well above one , ranging from 1.37 to 1.64 .",
    "a nanostructure with aspect ratio 2.44 is also studied , in order to probe the trends of g - factors in the quantum rod limit . in table",
    "[ size ] we summarize the in - plane diameter and out - of - plane diameter values of the nanostructures .",
    "if the aspect ratio of the nanostructures deviate from 1.0 by less than 10% then it is appropriate to use a single effective diameter ( @xmath64 ) to characterize the nanostructure .",
    "note that the nanostructures used in the trfr experiment have reported aspect ratios in the range of 1.17 - 1.34 .",
    "@xcite however a single effective diameter was nevertheless used to characterize the nanostructures .",
    "furthermore , the trfr sample has 5 - 15% size distribution and @xmath2 aspect ratio variation .",
    "hence , one must be cautious when making a quantitative comparison between the calculated and the experimental results .",

    "the data has been regrouped into heavy - hole like and light - hole light states . for each size of the nanostructure we look at the spectral weight of @xmath65 and @xmath66 states and",
    "determine which is more heavy - hole - like .",
    "similarly to the electron g - factors , the data for hole g - factors are also grouped by the nanocrystal aspect ratio .",
    "we observe that the two hole states have very different g - factors .",
    "both holes show strong oscillations as a function of the size .",
    "it is important to clarify how these g - factors should approach the relevant bulk values when the size of the nanocrystal increases . in the bulk cdse semiconductor ,",
    "the valence band near the @xmath40 point can be described by the luttinger hamiltonian.@xcite the states @xmath67 and @xmath68 are associated with the heavy - hole and light - hole respectively . if the heavy - hole and light - hole are really degenerate , then eq .",
    "( [ h_eff ] ) is actually not appropriate , since the nature of the @xmath69 angular momentum has to be taken into account .",
    "if the heavy - hole and light - hole are not degenerate and the mixing between @xmath68 and @xmath67 components are small , then one can use eq .",

    "we observe that the @xmath65 state becomes more and more heavy - hole like for nanocrystal with more than 450 atoms , provided that the aspect ratio is close to one .",
    "it is expected that as the size of the nanocrystal increases , the two hole states will eventually converge to the heavy - hole and light - hole respectively .",

    "we observe that the electron g - factors are strongly anisotropic , with @xmath72 for all nanocrystal sizes .",
    "the size dependence of the anisotropic electron g - factors agree quantitatively with the values extracted from trfr experimental data .",

    "this is very different from the original experimental suggestion that one of the g - factors is an isotropic electron g - factor while the other one is an exciton g - factor.@xcite we have investigated the aspect ratio dependence of the electron g - factors .",
    "we find that in general the g - factors initially increase as a function of the aspect ratio , and that @xmath1 increases more than @xmath0 . the increase of g - factors saturates around aspect ratio 1.62 - 2.44 .",
    "it is expected that @xmath1 will then begin to decrease again until it reaches the bulk value while @xmath0 will stay roughly the same , if the aspect ratio continue to increase .",
    "the aspect ratio dependence allows us to identify a regime where the anisotropy derived from the wurtzite structure and that derived from the shape of the nanocrystal cancel each other partially , resulting a more isotropic regime .",
    "however a full cancellation is never reached in our calculation , unlike the previous observation from a perturbative analysis .",
    "@xcite it also appears unlikely that in larger nanocrystals the cancellation will become complete , since the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath0 for an unit aspect ratio nanocrystal increases as a function of the size .",
