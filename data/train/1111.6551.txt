    "_ fermi _ has detected blazar variability as short as a few hours ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "during these flares , the gev luminosity has been known to increase by a factor of up to several compared to its pre - flare luminosity . because blazars can not be resolved at these energies ( or at any other energy , with the possible exception of vlba observations )",
    ", it is impossible to determine the location of these flares by direct detection .    to address this issue",
    ", we propose a diagnostic test that utilizes _ fermi _ variability data of short flares to determine the location of the gev emission in blazars .",
    "relativistic effects determine which photon field is dominant at varying distances from the central black hole , and as a result the location of the gev flaring site determines the dominant source of seed photons .",
    "the co - moving ( jet frame ) energy density of a radiation field @xmath0 scales as differing factors of @xmath1 depending on the direction from which the photons enter the emitting region @xcite . if the photon field is isotropic @xmath2 . for photons entering the emitting region from behind the relativistically moving blob @xmath3 .",
    "if we assume a nominal fsrq accretion disk luminosity of @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 and that a fraction @xmath6 of this radiation is reprocessed by both the blr and the mt , a typical luminosity of the external radiation field is @xmath7 erg s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "if the emission site is located within the blr ( at @xmath8 ) , the photon field can be considered isotropic in the galaxy frame and its co - moving energy density is @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , the mt photon field is isotropic inside the blr and its co - moving seed photon energy density is @xmath10 .",
    "clearly , inside the @xmath11 the co - moving blr photon field energy density dominates over that of the mt by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "if the emission site is located at @xmath13 ( within the mt ) then the blr uv photons enter the emitting region practically from behind , so that @xmath14 .",
    "the ir photons from the mt retain the same co - moving energy density previously given by @xmath10 . in this case , therefore , it is the mt that dominates the co - moving photon energy density .    these external photon field",
    "co - moving luminosities need to be compared to the synchrotron photon field energy density .",
    "if @xmath15 is the size of the emitting blob , the co - moving synchrotron photon energy density is @xmath16 .",
    "the most plausible assumption for the size of the emitting region , however , is to set an upper limit to it by its variability timescale : @xmath17 .",
    "we then obtain a lower limit for the synchrotron energy density @xmath18 , where we used a 6 hour variability scale , as seen in variability timescales observed by fermi @xcite .    although the synchrotron photon energy density is substantially lower than the blr photon energy density when the blazar emission site is within the blr , it is comparable or even higher than the mt photon energy density when the blazar emission site is within the mt but outside the blr .",
    "we briefly note here if we want to have a blob of a given size @xmath15 at a distance larger than @xmath19 , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the blob can not occupy the entire cross section of the jet .",
    "our diagnostic hinges on the fact that if the blazar emission site is located outside the blr , electron cooling occurs in the thomson regime .",
    "this is always true for the case of the mt photons being dominant and it can be shown that if ssc photons dominate , cooling still takes place within the thomson regime for powerful fsrqs .",
    "_ the critical difference between the blr and the mt is the energy of the seed photons : photons originating from the blr are uv photons ( @xmath20 ) while photons originating from the mt are ir photons ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "this difference by a factor of @xmath22 in typical photon energy is critical in that it affects the energy regime in which electron cooling takes place , and thus the energy dependence of the electron cooling time .",
    "_    in powerful fsrqs the ic emission in high states can dominate over the synchrotron emission by a factor of up to @xmath23 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in cases of high compton dominance ,",
    "the primary electron cooling mechanism is ic scattering . for electrons cooling in the thomson regime ( @xmath24 , where both the electron lorentz factor @xmath25 and the seed photon energy @xmath26 are measured in the same frame ) the cooling rate @xmath27 . for electrons with @xmath28",
    "cooling takes place in the klein - nishina ( kn ) regime with @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "given that the blr photons are @xmath22 more energetic than the mt photons , we expect that if cooling takes place in the blr , effects of the transition from the thomson to the kn regime will be manifested in electrons of energy @xmath30 times lower than if the cooling takes place within the mt .    .",

    "* ) . in short , because @xmath27 in the thomson regime and @xmath38 in the kn regime , the cooling time @xmath39 scales as @xmath40 in the thomson regime and as @xmath41 in the kn regime .",
    "because the cooling time is approximately energy independent around @xmath42 , this energy - independent cooling time will be manifested at energies lower by a factor of @xmath12 for cooling taking place in the blr compared to cooling taking place in the mt , since the blr seed photons have an energy higher than that of the mt by a factor of @xmath12 .",

    "this corresponds to a factor of @xmath12 compton dominance ( ratio of inverse compton to synchrotron luminosity ) , similar to what is observed in the most compton dominated sources .",
    "the transition from thomson cooling to kn cooling , and from kn cooling to synchrotron cooling can also be seen in fig .",

    "the energy dependence of the cooling time results in an energy dependence ( or lack thereof ) of variations : if the blazar emission site is located within the blr , variations should be achromatic .",
    "the energy dependence of the variations can be used as a diagnostic test to determine if the gev emission site is located within the blr . by comparing _",
    "fermi _ light curves of flares at different energies , we propose that the energy dependence of the light curve can be used as a diagnostic test to rule out whether the gev flare originates in the blr or mt .      to demonstrate the effect of the energy independence or dependence of the electron cooling time on the variability of a flare , we utilized a one - zone numerical model to simulate a flare .",
    "we initialized the code with values appropriate for a high power blazar with a compton dominance of @xmath12 .",
    "for this particular simulation we assumed a source size @xmath45 , bulk lorentz factor @xmath46 , co - moving injected electron luminosity @xmath47 erg s @xmath5 , maximum electron lorentz factor @xmath48 , and electron index @xmath49 .",
    "for the case of a flaring region located within the blr we assumed an initial photon energy @xmath50 and an energy density ( in the galaxy frame ) @xmath51 erg @xmath34 .",

    "being located outside the blr , we modeled the flux of a source with light - crossing time @xmath57 that is decreasing in flux .",
    "we assumed the flux of the source is decaying exponentially , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the cooling time at a specific energy .",

    "we assumed that the flaring site is located outside the blr ( i.e. cooling occurs in the thomson regime ) because this is case where different decay times need to be resolved .",
    "we created simulated data points at 6-hour time intervals , applied the energy - dependent maximum error from the _ fermi _ observations of the flare , and then fit a curve to the simulated data to obtain a cooling time . from this test , we found that even within maximum observational error , the decay times at different energies are still distinguishable .",
