    "strong evidences from the current cosmological observations converge upon the fact that the universe is spatially flat and there exists exotic component , dubbed dark energy , which drives the speed - up expansion of the universe .",
    "many scenarios have been proposed to explain the acceleration in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the preferred and simplest candidate for dark energy is the einstein s cosmological constant which can fit the observations well .",
    "however , it suffers from the so - called fine - tuning problem and coincidence problem .",
    "meanwhile , the observations are not yet able to confirm that dark energy is indeed a constant .",
    "actually , many dynamical models of dark energy have been studied extensively during the past over ten years , for a comprehensive review , see for example @xcite .    as is pointed out",
    ", the dark energy problem may be essentially an issue of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "although a complete theory of quantum gravity has not been established , some valuable ideas are thought to be the features of the theory of quantum gravity , such as non - locality .",
    "non - locality can naturally arise in string theory and the non - local corrections to the effective action of gravity can be generated from quantum loop effects .",
    "it is also believed that the black hole information paradox may be resolved by the effect of non - locality @xcite .",
    "recently , a new non - local corrected theory of gravity was suggested in the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the inverse dalembertian acting on the scalar curvature@xcite . in the limit of @xmath5 , it goes back to general relativity .",
    "it was found that this kind of non - local gravity may lead to a unified description of the early - time universe and the present accelerating universe@xcite and there is no apparent conflicts with observations in the solar system tests@xcite .",
    "non - local gravity has been extensively investigated in the literature @xcite .    in this work , we shall suggest a modified non - local term to the effective action of gravity and investigate its implications in cosmology and the solar system tests .",
    "although , just as that in action ( [ action0 ] ) , this form of non - local corrections to gravity has also no direct support from fundamental theories , we wish it appears to provide a small window through which one can look into phenomenological aspects of fundamental theories .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we first present the model in general form and a triple - scalar tensor representation is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cosmology ] , we investigate the cosmological dynamics of the theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec-1 ] the scalar mode of cosmological perturbation to the first order and its newtionian limit are considered .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our results and give some discussions .",
    "we here consider the following simple modified action of the non - locally corrected gravity @xmath6+\\mathcal{l}_{m}\\right\\ } ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the determinant of metric tensor @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a generic function which has the same dimension with ricci scalar @xmath11 . here , @xmath12 is the inverse dalmbertian operator , which is in fact an integral operator , therefore , the above action is non - local .",
    "the equations of motion derived directly from this action will be rather difficult to handle because of the non - locality . however , by introducing two lagrange multipliers @xmath13 and @xmath14 and replacing the inverse dalembertian and ricci scalar as two auxiliary scalar fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , the above action can be rewritten in the following form , @xmath17 .",

    "partially and neglecting the boundary terms , then the double derivative is eliminated as usual , we obtain a kind of triple - scalar - tensor theory @xmath21 + \\mathcal{l}_{m}\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is noted that this kinetic coupling can not eliminated by a field redefinition . to be convenient ,",
    "defining @xmath22 and taking @xmath16 as a function of @xmath23 , then introducing a new function @xmath24 , we can rewritten action ( [ eq : action3 ] ) as @xmath25 + \\mathcal{l}_{m}\\right\\}.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] contrary to the case for the action ( [ action0 ] ) , in which the local equations of motion can be derived by varying with respect to the metric and two auxiliary fields , there are three auxiliary local fields in our model ( [ eq : action4 ] ) .    by varying action([eq :",
    "action4 ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath8 , we obtain the following modified einstein equations @xmath26 where we have defined @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the einstein tensor defined as usual and @xmath29 denotes the stress tensor of matter . furthermore , the variation with respect to @xmath15 , @xmath14 and @xmath23 gives the following equations of motion @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath14 is not zero , we have @xmath33 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath23 . because matter is minimally coupled with other fields , the matter energy - momentum tensor is conserved , @xmath34 .",
    "note that this conservation law is not an independent condition .",
    "in this section , we shall investigate the cosmological dynamics of the non - locally corrected theory presented in the above section . in a flat 4-dimensional friedmann - robertson - walker(frw ) space - time , @xmath35,\\ ] ] we obtain the friedmann equations @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the hubble parameter , the overdots denote the derivatives with respect to cosmic time @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are energy density and pressure of matter , respectively .",
    "the two scalar field equations become @xmath42 @xmath43 besides , the usual matter conservation law reads @xmath44 where we have assumed an equation of state for the matter @xmath45 .",
    "it is worth noting that , due to the bianchi identity , only four equations among eqs.([eq : friedman]-[eq:22 ] ) are independent .    to rewrite the equation of motions as a dynamical system",
    ", we may define new dimensionless variables @xmath46 @xmath47 as the functions of @xmath48 .",
    "then , the cosmological dynamics can be represented by the following equations @xmath49[eq : dx2 ] @xmath50\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( \\frac{1}{6}x_7x_8 - 1)x_2-x_7-(3w-1)\\omega_m,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57,\\ ] ] where the primes denote the derivative with respect to @xmath58 and the parameter @xmath59 is defined to be @xmath60 .",
    "the friedman equation is now a constraint equation @xmath61 for an exponential potential @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "then , from eq.([eq : x8 ] ) , we know @xmath64 is a constant .",
    "one the other hand , it is clear that @xmath65 is a solution of eq.([eq : x7 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can easily obtain the following solution @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are constants .",
    "the friedman equation requires that @xmath75 . from @xmath76 , we know in this solution the scalar curvature @xmath77 , hence , @xmath78 , where we have set @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "clearly , when the equation of state @xmath81 , the solution is stable and the fixed point @xmath82 is an atrractor . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the evolution of effect equation of state @xmath83 in the exponential model for different initial conditions . it is found that there exist a stable attractor where @xmath84 .",
    "we note that in this model , the acceleration of the universe depend heavily on the ininital conditions .",
    "this solution may be a good representation of the early universe when a radiation dominated phase follows naturally from an inflationary expansion .",
    "also , it is interesting to find that there is a case with realizing a crossing of the phantom divide from the non - phantom ( quintessence ) phase to the phantom one for some time and then going back to the non - phantom phase at late time .     with respect to @xmath85 in the exponential model @xmath86 for different initial conditions , where the parameter @xmath87 is set to be @xmath88 .",
    "]    let us now consider whether there is a de sitter solution of the theory in which the hubble parameter is a constant , @xmath89 and the scale factor @xmath90 .",
    "we assume that @xmath14 is not zero , so @xmath91 in the equations is just the scalar curvature @xmath11 , which is also a constant in this case , @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , from eq.([eq : ddxi ] ) , the solution for @xmath14 can be straightforward obtained , @xmath93 for simplicity , we let the intergal constants @xmath94 and @xmath95 vanish .",
    "this means @xmath96 .",
    "we also assume the potential function @xmath0 is given by a linear function @xmath97 , where the constant @xmath98 should be equal to @xmath99 due to the relation ( [ eq : rvprime ] ) .",
    "therefore , from the definition of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , we have @xmath102 . applying this relation and assuming @xmath103",
    ", we obtain that @xmath104 is a constant , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , where @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath74 are three constants .",
    "thus , using cosmic time @xmath39 , we can represent the solution as @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 . note that if the potential @xmath116 is a linear function of @xmath23 , from its definition , @xmath1 should be also a linear function ,",
    "that is , the non - locally corrected term in the action reads @xmath117 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the trajectories of the evolution of @xmath118 under different initial conditions . it is shown that @xmath118 trends to the limit @xmath88 in the future regardless of what the initial value takes , which may means that the de sitter solution above is a stable attractor solution .",
    "meanwhile , in the past , there may exists an repeller solution representing an effective radiation dominated universe in which @xmath84 .",
    "with respect to @xmath85 in the linear model @xmath97 for different initial conditions . ]",
    "in this section , we show cosmological perturbation equations in our theory . clearly , the evolution of scalar perturbations are much more complicated than those of the vector and tensor perturbations because they are heavily coupled to scalar fields and matter . here",
    "we only consider scalar perturbations . as usual ,",
    "once the scalar modes of perturbations are introduced , the perturbed metric can be written in the newtonian gauge to the first order as @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are two scalar potentials . when both of the two potentials vanish , the frw metric of the background universe is recovered . meanwhile , the three scalar fields are perturbed to be @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively . similarly , as for matter , the energy density and pressure are perturbed to be @xmath125 and @xmath126 . inserting these expressions into einstein equation ( [ eq : einstein1 ] ) , up to the first order",
    ", we obtain the following equations for the perturbations @xmath127 - 3h^{2}\\delta f\\nonumber\\\\   & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\xi r\\delta\\phi+v(\\phi)\\delta\\xi-3(\\dot{\\psi}\\dot{\\delta\\xi}+\\dot{\\xi}\\dot{\\delta\\psi}+2\\psi\\dot{\\xi}\\dot{\\psi})\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 3h(2\\psi \\dot{f}-\\dot{\\delta f})-3\\dot{\\phi}\\dot{f}+a^{-2}\\nabla^{2}\\delta f=-\\kappa\\delta\\rho_{m},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath128\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( \\delta f)_{,0i}-\\dot{f}\\psi_{,i}-h(\\delta f)_{,i}=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath129 - 2f\\ddot{\\phi } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & ( \\dot{\\psi}-3\\dot{\\phi})(2hf+\\dot{f})+2\\psi(\\ddot{f}+2h\\dot{f})-(\\ddot{\\delta    f}+2h\\dot{\\delta f})\\nonumber\\\\ & + & a^{-2}\\left[f(\\nabla^{2}\\phi+\\nabla^{2}\\psi)+\\nabla^{2}\\delta      f\\right]\\left.\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & -&f(\\psi_{,ij}+\\phi_{,ij})-a^{-2}\\delta f_{,ij}=\\kappa\\delta^{i}_{\\ j}\\delta p_{m},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 .",
    "similarly , from equations of motion for the scalar fields , we have @xmath131\\nonumber \\\\   & + & 2\\psi\\left[(\\ddot{\\xi}+3h\\dot{\\xi})+6(\\dot{h}+2h^{2})\\right]\\nonumber \\\\    & + & a^{-2}\\left[\\nabla^{2}\\delta\\xi+2(\\nabla^{2}\\psi+2\\nabla^{2}\\phi)\\right]=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath132\\nonumber \\\\ & + & 2\\psi\\left[(\\ddot{\\psi}+3h\\dot{\\psi})+6\\phi(\\dot{h}+2h^{2})\\right]\\nonumber \\\\ & + & a^{-2}\\left[\\nabla^{2}\\delta\\psi+2\\phi(\\nabla^{2}\\psi+2\\nabla^{2}\\phi)\\right]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the newtonian limit of the cosmological perturbations , we may omit the cosmological expansion and set scale factor @xmath133 .",
    "moreover , the derivatives with respect to time , relative to those with respect to space , are also negligibly small .",
    "therefore , in the vacuum outside a mass where the source term can be neglected , the shear constraint ( [ eq:70 ] ) gives @xmath134 = \\left[f(\\psi_{,ij}+\\phi_{,ij})+\\delta f_{,ij}\\right],\\ ] ] which shows that the gravitational potentials are not equal , @xmath135 meanwhile , from the perturbation equations ( [ eq:80 ] ) and ( [ eq:90 ] ) , we have @xmath136 solving the above two equations and using the condition that the usual schwarzschild solution is recovered in the limit of general relativity , we obtain that @xmath137 the perturbation @xmath138 may be neglected because field @xmath23 is not dynamical .",
    "therefore , applying the relation @xmath139 to eliminating @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , we get the post - newtonian parameter @xmath143 which is stringently constrained to its value in general relativity @xmath144 from the solar system tests such as the cassini spacecraft @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath2 is not directly affected by the potential function @xmath0 ( or equivalently , @xmath1 ) , the constraints is still imposed because the value of @xmath145 and @xmath23 are heavily dependent on @xmath0 .",
    "in this work , we investigated a new form of non - locally modified theory of gravity with action ( [ eq : orginaction ] ) . just as action ( [ action0 ] )",
    "can be recast as a local biscalar - tensor theory , this non - local theory can be locally represented by a triple - scalar - tensor theory . in the context of cosmology , we show that there exists a stable de sitter solution for the cosmological dynamics if a suitable form of potential function @xmath0 ( or equivalently , @xmath1 ) is selected .",
    "but , no matter what a potential function is selected , there is always an early time repeller solution corresponding to a radiation dominated universe .",
    "however , it should be stressed that a long enough period of matter domination , in which structure is supposed to be formed , is crucial for a successful cosmology and a lack of a matter dominated era could make an accelerating model impracticable .",
    "therefore , it may be an alternative to dark energy for the late - time acceleration , only if a matter dominated era can appear naturally between the radiation dominated era and the late - time accelerating phase .",
    "on the other hand , we presented a set of equations for scalar linear perturbations and considered the newtonian limit for static spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "it is found that the form of potential function @xmath0 is stringently constrained by the solar system test , although the post - newtonian parameter @xmath2 is not directly affected by this function .    just as in the framework of most higher derivative gravity theories @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that ghosts will appear in most of the non - local gravity models . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it is also found that the introduction of a @xmath1 term into the non - local action ( [ action0 ] ) will not contribute to the solution of this problem .",
    "unfortunately , in the non - local theory investigated here , this problem is still unsolved .",
    "one of the three introduced scalar degree of freedom is phantom - like ( or a ghost ) and the other two are quintessence - like .",
    "see appendix a for the detail discussions .",
    "introducing a new non - minimally coupled scalar field into the action of gravity may alleviate this problem @xcite . although the theory considered here may have some problems in some aspects and",
    "there is no direct support from fundamental theories , it is hard to deny that it appears to provide a small window through which one can look into phenomenological aspects of fundamental theories .    as is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , replacing the operator @xmath12 in action ( [ action0 ] ) will introduce spurious degrees of freedom , because even when @xmath146 is constant , there exist nontrivial homogeneous and isotropic vacuum solutions of the einstein solution in the scalar - tensor representation of the theory .",
    "however , we find that the two cosmological solutions considered in the work are not artifacts of the scalar - tensor theory ( [ eq : action4 ] ) , but should be two real solutions of the original theory ( [ eq : orginaction ] ) , although we are now not sure that whether the field content of the original theory and the triple - scalar - tensor representation are the same",
    ". this may deserve thorough investigation in the future .",
    "let us perform a conformal transformation to the einstein frame @xmath147 hence @xmath148,\\ ] ] with @xmath149 .",
    "therefore , for the vacuum case , action ( [ eq : action4 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath150 defining @xmath151 as the coefficient matrix of the kinetic terms @xmath152 and @xmath153 as its eigenvalue .",
    "since @xmath151 is real @xmath154 symmetric matrix , there must exist three real eigenvalues for the kinetic terms , which are determined by the condition @xmath155 . in order to avoid the ghost degree of freedom , all the three values of @xmath153",
    "must be positive .",
    "however , the product of the three values is determined by @xmath156 , which is always negative and the sum of them is @xmath157 which is positive .",
    "this means that one of the three eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix @xmath151 is negative and the other two are positive .",
