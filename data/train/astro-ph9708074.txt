    "ccd photometry was obtained in a field of 0.5 square degree in the bar of the lmc between 1991 - 1993 for eros .",
    "about 2500 images spanning @xmath1130 days were taken in two broad bandpass filters @xmath15 and @xmath16 centered respectively on 490 and 670 nm in the 9192 campaign , and 5500 images were taken of the same field with a pair of very similar filters ( @xmath17 ) for the 1992 - 1993 campaign .",
    "we have systematically searched the eros database for variable stars using the modified periodogram technique@xcite@xcite and the aov method@xcite .    among the hundredth detected variable stars , we have discovered a bright lmc variable star ( @xmath18m@xmath19 , equinox 2000.0 ) with a period of @xmath0 days and a particular behaviour , a clear alternance between cycles with larger and smaller amplitudes ( fig 1 ) .",
    "a fourier fit with 8 independent frequencies leads to a spectrum with two dominant frequencies at @xmath2=825.69 phz and at 1.5003@xmath3 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "this suggests that the pulsation of this star is phase locked between two modes of frequencies @xmath2 and 1.5@xmath3 .    from the photometry ,",
    "assuming different values of reddening ( e(b - v ) = 0.10 - 0.30 ) and applying the temperature scale from kurucz s atmospheric models , we estimate the effective temperature of the star to be in the range @xmath20 .",
    "low resolution spectroscopy in the wavelength range @xmath25 has been obtained at eso la silla in december 1995 with the eso 1.5 m equiped with a boller and chivens spectrograph .",
    "the resolution was @xmath26 , and we get a signal to noise ratio of 50 at @xmath27",
    ". this star belongs to the lmc .",
    "its spectrum shows strong @xmath28 and @xmath5 emission lines , and neutral lines of helium indicating a spectral type between late o and early b ( fig 3 ) .",
    "further observational information are : + ( 1 ) this star is located in the same area in the bar of the lmc , where 7 pre main sequence star candidates ( pmsc ) have been found@xcite . +",
    "( 2 ) it presents strong balmer emission lines ( equivalent width of @xmath29 for @xmath30 ) .",
    "+ ( 3 ) its colour and spectrum suggest a spectral type between late o and early b. + ( 4 ) we have no evidence for the presence of an extended @xmath31 region around this object .",
    "+ ( 5 ) it is brighter than the pmsc which we discovered in the lmc .",
    "+ ( 6 ) it presents an irregular photometric variability with a time scale of @xmath32 days",
    ". however , the photometric variability seems to be due to a two mode phase - locked pulsation .",
    "the observed large amplitude leads to favour a radial pulsation rather a non - radial one .",
    "+ based on these arguments , we suggest that this star can be a pre main sequence object or a post - agb star . a companion poster @xcite examine the possible nature of this object by means of a linear stability analysis of hydrostatic envelopes , and computations of hydrodynamical models .",
