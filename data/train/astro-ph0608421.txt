    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation contains a wealth of information about our universe .",
    "not only does the angular power spectrum of the cmb temperature fluctuations allow us to determine cosmological parameters that shape our understanding of the universe , but the issue of primordial gaussianity and statistical isotropy of the cmb also taps the most fundamental principle in cosmology , and any robust detection of a deviation would have far - reaching and indeed revolutionary implications .    interpreting the term `` gaussianity '' in the most relevant way for cosmology , i.e. as meaning that the fluctuations form a statistically homogeneous and isotropic gaussian random field @xcite , the issue of non - gaussianity in the cmb data was first raised by @xcite in the cobe data @xcite .",
    "after the release of the 1-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( ) data @xcite , departures from gaussianity have been detected with various methods @xcite .",
    "although gaussianity ( as we define it ) requires statistical isotropy , a special focus and results on the breaking of large - scale statistical isotropy have been reported in @xcite . among them ,",
    "the most notable anomaly involves the alignment of the quadrupole and octupole alignment in the general direction of virgo . in the 3-year data",
    "@xcite the previously detected departures from gaussianity and statistical isotropy still persist @xcite .",
    "the question is whether they are attributed to foreground residuals @xcite , systematic errors @xcite , local structures @xcite or even new physics @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to eliminate the least exciting possibilities before getting carried away by the most exotic ones . in particular",
    ", one has to be cautious about foreground residuals as they are surely present in the derived cmb map .",
    "the elimination of foregrounds and the extraction of cmb signal is based on the concept of minimum variance optimization with the _ a priori _ assumption that cmb and the foregrounds are statistically independent : linearly combining all available maps and minimizing the variance of the combined map to reduce the foreground residuals as much as possible .",
    "the 3-year de - biased internal linear combination ( dilc ) map is based on such a concept by the science team .",
    "this approach can certainly help to achieve the optimal estimate of the angular power spectrum for the cmb .",
    "it can not , however , guarantee the optimal morphology ( spatial distribution ) .",
    "since most of the anomalies , with the exception of the reported low quadrupole power @xcite , are related to the pattern of fluctuations rather than simply their amplitude , one needs to check the derived cmb map very carefully before any scientific conclusion is reached . in this light ,",
    "several authors have investigated possible foreground contaminations @xcite and the effect of different subtraction methods @xcite .",
    "the _ a priori _ assumption that the cmb and the foregrounds are statistically independent and thus have no significant cross - correlation is not only the backbone of the minimum variance optimization method , it is also the most basic principle ( preceding gaussianity of the cmb ) , furnishing the most fundamental statistical test for foreground cleaning . note that statistical independence involves an ensemble of universes , there will , therefore , inevitably be accidental cross - correlations caused by chance alignments , particularly on large angular scales due to the cosmic variance effect @xcite .",
    "efforts on the investigation on large - scale foreground contamination by direct cross - correlation were made in the harmonic domain .",
    "based on the close connection between the phases of the spherical harmonic modes , and morphology @xcite , @xcite examine foreground residuals by cross - correlation of phases between the internal linear combination maps and the derived foreground maps .    in this paper , we use a new representation of the spherical harmonic modes to analyze the cross correlation between the dilc and foreground maps . instead of using the the two - dimensional spheres",
    ", we use an inverse fourier transform on the spherical harmonic modes for each @xmath0 producing one - dimensional curves for each harmonic scale .",
    "we therefore call such representation one - dimensional fourier representation ( 1dfr ) . chiang and naselsky @xcite first devised the 1dfr to illustrate connection between phase coupling and morphology , particularly relating to local extrema higher than 3@xmath4 . chiang , naselsky and coles @xcite use the same representation to demonstrate the anomalies in the distribution of global extrema of the 1dfr curves of the dilc map for the @xmath5 modes .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the gaussian random hypothesis of the cmb . in section 3",
    "we introduce the 1dfr and its properties and advantages .",
    "we then use simple cross - correlation and extremum correlation to examine foreground contamination in the dilc map in section 4 .",
    "we discuss the minimum variance optimization method and use cross - correlation coefficients to estimate the level of foreground contamination in section 5 .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "the statistical characterization of cmb temperature fluctuations ( against the cmb isotropic temperature @xmath6 k ) on a sphere can be expressed as a sum over spherical harmonics : @xmath7 where the @xmath8 are spherical harmonic functions , defined in terms of the legendre polynomials @xmath9 using @xmath10 and the @xmath11 are complex coefficients which can be expressed with @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the phases .",
    "we use the condon - shortly definition for the spherical harmonic decomposition .",
    "isotropic gaussian random cmb temperature fluctuations on a sphere , of the type that result from the simplest versions of the inflation paradigm , possess spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath11 whose real and imaginary parts are mutually independent and both gaussian , or equivalently , the amplitudes @xmath14 are rayleigh distributed with random phases @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties are then completely specified by the second - order statistics , the angular power spectrum @xmath15 , @xmath16 since @xmath17 is always real , the complex vectors of the @xmath11 on the argand plane for @xmath18 are mirror images of @xmath19 with respect to @xmath20 axis for even @xmath21 , and with respect to @xmath22 axis for odd @xmath21 .",
    "the statistics for real signal on a sphere are therefore registered only in the spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath11 for @xmath23 .",
    "recent studies of the large angular scale properties for the cmb temperature anisotropy @xcite are based on the composite map constructed for each @xmath0 by summing all the @xmath21 modes pertaining to that @xmath0 : @xmath24 alternatively , one can represent @xmath11 in each @xmath0 by an inverse fourier transform , as the @xmath11 is now a function of a single variable @xmath21 .",
    "such a 1dfr for @xmath11 from the spherical harmonic decomposition of the sky is written as @xmath25 where for the negative @xmath21 we use the complex conjugate ( @xmath26 ) to make @xmath27 real . as we have mentioned for real @xmath17 on a sphere the statistics are registered only in @xmath28 modes , the @xmath27 curves assembled in this way contain the same amount of information as the spherical @xmath29 . the variance for each curve is then @xmath30 ^ 2 d\\varphi=2\\sum_{m=1}^\\l |\\alm|^2.\\ ] ] for a gaussian random field ( grf ) , the @xmath14 have a rayleigh distribution , so @xmath31 has a chi - square distribution .      since the 1dfr results in @xmath33 as a single function of @xmath34 , such representation is therefore similar to the integration on @xmath32 used in the composite maps : @xmath35 there are , however , some subtleties",
    "can be written as follows @xmath36\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath37 for odd @xmath38 , the curves from the integration over @xmath32 from the composite maps have contributions from only the odd @xmath21 part for odd @xmath0 and the even @xmath21 part for even @xmath0 .",
    "therefore for odd @xmath0 , the @xmath39 term inverts the resulting temperature @xmath17 as seen from the 1dfr .",
    "( as we use the condon - shortley definition for the spherical harmonic functions , @xmath40 is always positive for @xmath19 and 0 for @xmath41 ) .",
    "accordingly , in , for the odd @xmath0 curves the amplitudes are multiplied by @xmath42 to facilitate direct comparison .",
    "the @xmath34 coordinate of the 1dfr is also plotted backwards in order to match the galactic longitude coordinate @xmath43 ( not to be confused with the spherical harmonic mode @xmath0 ; see ( top panel ) .",
    "moreover , the integration over @xmath32 results in more symmetric curves than the simple 1dfr , where equal footing is given to each @xmath11 in the summation . as shown in , the curves ( red ) obtained by integration of @xmath32 from the composite maps show repetitions for @xmath44 at @xmath45 $ ] and @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "the 1dfr assembles spherical harmonic coefficients into one - dimensional curves , so the information on @xmath32 direction is lost , compared with standard two - dimensional spherical maps . nevertheless , the morphology and statistics registered in the complex @xmath11 sequence should still manifest themselves in this representation . for a gaussian random field on a sphere , the real and imaginary parts of the spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath11 in each @xmath0 are mutually independent and both gaussian distributed with zero mean and variance @xmath47 , where @xmath15 is its angular power spectrum .",
    "thus if the @xmath11 are a result of gaussian process , the 1dfr @xmath27 curves shall possess all the usual gaussian random properties such as two - point correlation , peak statistics , and minkowski functionals  etc ..    one of the 1dfr characteristics is that the @xmath48 modes contribute to the 1d curves only a constant shift without altering the morphology , whereas in spherical harmonic composition it produces modulation in @xmath32 direction , @xmath49 .",
    "this is useful when one is to compare two sets of @xmath11 with standard cross - correlation , particularly when one of them is from a foreground map .",
    "standard analysis on large angular scale ( low multipole ) anomalies is performed on a composite map by : a full - sky map synthesized from the @xmath11 from @xmath50 to @xmath21 for each @xmath0 ( see top panel as an example ) . for foreground maps defined in galactic coordinate system",
    ", the emission near the galactic plane dominates the signal , which is then spherical - harmonic transformed into high amplitudes of @xmath51 for even @xmath0 ( bottom ) , which produce a prominent belt in the composite maps , making them rather difficult to analyze under such situation .",
    "in this section we investigate foreground contamination in the 3-year dilc map .",
    "it is based on the _ a priori _ assumption that the cmb ( at the background ) should have no `` knowledge '' about what the foregrounds look like .",
    "so if the derived dilc map more or less reflects the morphology of true cmb , the dilc and foregrounds should have little or no resemblance to it ; we can also see how clean is the derived dilc by directly comparing the morphology .",
    "firstly , in the top mosaic of we plot the 1dfr curves for the dilc ( blue curves ) and those of the derived foreground maps at q ( orange ) , v ( green ) and w ( red ) channels .",
    "the foreground maps are the sum of the synchrotron , free - free and dust templates obtained via maximum entropy method @xcite .",
    "as one can see , the most striking feature is the significant anti - correlation between the dilc and foregrounds for the quadrupole ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "+    in the bottom mosaic of we plot , on a unit circle for each 1dfr curve , the positions of local extrema : all @xmath34 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the angle between each sign and the positive @xmath20 axis is @xmath34 for each local extremum position .",
    "the blue filled signs are from the dilc and the open signs the foreground map at q ( orange ) , v ( green ) and w ( red ) channels .",
    "we use circles and diamonds to denote peaks ( @xmath54 ) and troughs ( @xmath55 ) , respectively .",
    "the size of the signs is @xmath56 so that one can see there are 12 out of totally 16 local extrema for @xmath57 dilc 1dfr curves with w channel foreground map 1dfr local extrema located within @xmath58 .    in what follows ,",
    "we employ cross correlation and correlation of extrema of the 1dfr curves to illustrate the foreground contamination in the dilc map .",
    "the cross correlation is a measure of `` trend '' : two curves will yield strong cross correlation if both go up or down in tandem at the same interval of @xmath34 .",
    "however , any correlation will be cancelled out if they match on one half of @xmath34 , but on the other they are opposite .",
    "although cross and extremum correlation are not totally independent , it is therefore intuitively helpful to examine both properties .",
    "we use cross - correlation to quantify the foreground contamination in the dilc map : @xmath59 \\left [ t_\\l^j(\\varphi)- \\overline{t_\\l^j}\\right]d\\varphi}{\\sigma^i_\\l \\sigma^j_\\l } , \\label{xcorr}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 indicates the 1dfr curve of multipole number @xmath0 at @xmath34 of @xmath61 map , @xmath62 is the standard deviation of the curve .",
    "the @xmath63 coefficients range from @xmath42 to 1 . in",
    "we show the @xmath63 coefficients between 1dfr curves of the dilc and those of the foregrounds .",
    "first of all , if the dilc map is uncorrelated with the foregrounds , the probabilities for positive and negative @xmath63 should be equally @xmath64 .",
    "one can see that eight out of the nine modes ( except @xmath57 ) @xmath65 , an outcome for which the probability is @xmath66 .",
    "+    secondly , the cross correlation in quadrupole is below @xmath67 ( at around 90% cl ) . in our previous publication @xcite",
    ", we use cross correlation of phases between the dilc and foreground maps to examine foreground contamination .",
    "the most prominent correlation appears in octupole , which renders the significance level as low as @xmath68 .",
    "although we do not claim that the quadrupole - octupole alignment is directly caused by the foregrounds , we can at least claim that since there is significant foreground contamination , such alignment is not cosmological . in the lower 4 panels of we also show the cross correlation between the foregrounds , which are all above 0.96 .      in our previous publication @xcite",
    ", we used a 1dfr on the 9 modes @xmath69 of the dilc map and examined the positions of the global extrema of the 9 curves .",
    "if the signal were gaussian , the global extrema should distribute randomly on the @xmath34 axis .",
    "we found that the extrema are concentrated around @xmath70 and avoid the @xmath71 ( galactic centre ) with significance level below 0.5% , which is a strong indication that the global extrema of the dilc map are non - randomly distributed due to some influence related to a galactic - coordinate frame .",
    "here we further examine the local extrema of the 1dfr curves of the dilc map and their correlation with those of the foregrounds .    in order to extract information about correlation of extrema between dilc and the foregrounds",
    ", we use the following method : for each foreground extremum , we search for its nearest dilc extremum and denote their distance by @xmath72 , where @xmath61 denotes the @xmath61th extremum of the foreground curve .",
    "the collection of the separation angles for each @xmath0 is to be compared with the distribution of @xmath73 monte carlo simulation on the grf extrema against the foreground ones . in the top mosaic of we",
    "show the cumulative probability distribution of the separation angles between the dilc and w channel foreground extrema ( red curves ) and that of separation angles of @xmath73 realizations of simulated grf and w channel foreground extrema ( black ) .",
    "the bottom panel is the significance level from kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test for the distribution of extrema of dilc with foreground maps at k channel ( green @xmath74 signs ) , ka channel ( red @xmath75 signs ) , q ( blue @xmath76 signs ) , v ( black @xmath77 signs ) , w ( black line ) .",
    "one can see that for @xmath3 and 6 , the significance levels are all below 0.1 for all channels , and specifically , the significance levels are below 0.03 for the v channel , which is also the channel with the highest weight assigned by in the internal linear combination of multi - frequency cleaning to extract the cmb signal .      to further certify foreground contamination in the dilc map , we also test various other full - sky foreground templates that are measured , collected or derived independently from the data .",
    "the existing foreground templates are the 408 mhz radio continuum survey @xcite tracing the synchrotron pattern , the h@xmath78 template for thermal bremsstrahlung ( free - free emission ) @xcite , and the dust template extrapolated from cobe / dirbe data to microwave frequencies @xcite .",
    "we repeat the cross correlation of the 1dfr curves in section 4.1 and show the cross correlation coefficient @xmath63 in fig.[x.indep ] . for both the synchrotron and dust templates , 8 of the 9 modes",
    "are negatively correlated with the dilc , the probability of this happening in the absence of real correlation only being @xmath79 .",
    "we find no significant evidence of cross - correlation with the h@xmath78 template , but this is not unexpected since this makes only a small contribution to the expected foreground at relevant frequencies .",
    "one should note that , although the 408 mhz map and the dust template are templates relating to single foreground components , they can be considered as total foreground templates as they represent the dominant component at the corresponding frequencies .",
    "their correlation with the dilc strengthens the claims we made in the previous section .",
    "in the last section , we have shown through strong cross correlation and peak correlation that the dilc signal is probably contaminated with foregrounds .",
    "we now examine the concept of multi - frequency cleaning method and how foreground residuals propagate into the final map .",
    "multi - frequency cleaning has been the workhorse for retrieving the cmb signal from polluted data .",
    "it is based on the concept that the cmb signal exists , among different frequency maps , as a frequency independent component @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 represents the total measured signal at frequency band @xmath61 , @xmath82 the frequency independent ( i.e. the cmb ) signal , and @xmath83 the foreground at frequency band @xmath61 ( here we assume noise is not important ) .",
    "this frequency - independent component can be flushed out with an internal linear combination on @xmath84 frequency bands of maps with weighting coefficients @xmath85 : @xmath86 where @xmath87 represents the ilc map .",
    "the _ a priori _ assumption that the frequency independent component should be statistically independent with others ensures the variance of the ilc map is the sum of the variances of the two parts : @xmath88={\\rm var}[t^\\cmb]+{\\rm var}[\\sum_{i=1}^m w_i f^i ] .",
    "\\label{ilc}\\ ] ] therefore if one is to minimize the variance of the ilc map by @xmath89/\\partial w_i = 0 $ ] , it is equivalent to minimizing the variance of linear combination of the foregrounds , @xmath90}{\\partial w_i } \\equiv \\frac{\\partial { \\rm var}[\\sum_{i=1}^m w_i f^i]}{\\partial w_i},\\ ] ] thus reducing most the residuals to produce a map closest to the cmb .",
    "the dilc map is thus produced by employing the minimum variance optimization in the pixel domain in 12 separate regions , where region 0 marks the largest region for @xmath91 , and region @xmath92 for those around the galactic plane . in each region",
    "the 5 frequency maps are linearly combined and a set of weighting coefficients @xmath93 are obtained in such a way that the resultant variance is minimum .",
    "it is worth noting that requires statistical independence that is defined between the foregrounds and an ensemble of universes , but the fact that we have only one universe shall introduce some error in the minimization process .",
    "furthermore , since the minimum variance optimization takes on the _ overall _ variance of the map , instead of the individual multipoles as the method by @xcite , there is no guarantee that the contamination from the foregrounds in each multipole @xmath0 will be minimum ( let alone zero ) . a spherical harmonic decomposition of gives @xmath94 where @xmath95 represents the spherical harmonic coefficients for the foreground map @xmath83 . for higher multipoles ,",
    "the power spectrum @xmath15 of the dilc should be close to that of cmb as there are more @xmath21 modes participating in the summation @xmath96 is more or less non - correlated between each @xmath21 of the same @xmath0 ( like white noise ) .",
    "on the other hand , for lower multipoles , the discrepancy between cmb and the dilc can be prominent when the foreground residuals are correlated .    from the significant cross and extremum correlation as shown in and ,",
    "it is indeed likely that the foreground residual is still a non - negligible part for low multipoles in the dilc map , unless the true cmb signal happens to resemble the foregrounds , an eventuality which has a small probability .      to make an estimate of the foreground contamination present in the dilc map",
    ", we can first of all write @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the r.m.s . of the fluctuation of @xmath95 and @xmath99",
    "is the _ unitary _ foreground signal ( related to morphology ) with its r.m.s . of fluctuation @xmath100 .",
    "such a degeneracy can be seen in that most cross - correlations between foregrounds are above 0.99 ( except with the w channel @xmath101 ) .",
    "we now calculate the cross correlation coefficient of the 1dfr curves between the true cmb and the unitary foreground signal : @xmath102 although the cmb and the foregrounds should be statistically independent , i.e. @xmath103 , the fact that we only have one realization of the cmb fluctuation makes this parameter crucial , especially for low multipoles .    to relate the @xmath104 to the measured @xmath105 ,",
    "we first show , in the top panel of , the cross - correlation of the foreground residuals with the foregrounds .",
    "the dilc map is processed with 12 sets of weighting coefficients @xmath93 , where @xmath106 represent k , ka , q , v and w bands , respectively and @xmath107 indicates regions @xmath108 , so for the foreground residual we use a linear combination of the foregrounds on 12 separated regions to obtain the whole sky map : @xmath109 from which we produce the 1dfr curves @xmath110 .",
    "one can see that for @xmath3 , 3 and 4 , the foreground residual has significant anti - correlation with the foregrounds .",
    "we caution that the foregrounds are retrieved via the maximum entropy method , not by direct subtraction of the dilc signal off the frequency maps , so the dilc is not a simple sum of the true cmb and the foreground residual as . for the modes in which the residual has significant correlation",
    ", we express the residuals in terms of the unitary foreground signals @xmath111 : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the contamination parameter at multipole number @xmath0 . for other multipoles",
    ", this approach means we are estimating the most possible contamination .    the cross correlation between the 1dfr curves of the dilc and the foreground maps can be written as @xmath114 we can now denote @xmath115 as it is independent of the individual foreground channels .",
    "the measured @xmath116 , as shown in the top panel of , are indeed degenerate due to the resemblance in morphology between the foregrounds . with we can solve for @xmath113 : @xmath117 describes the contamination parameter in relation to @xmath104 and @xmath118 . in the middle panel of we",
    "plot the foreground contamination parameter @xmath113 in unit of @xmath119 against the cross correlation coefficients @xmath118 .",
    "the thick line is for zero correlation between cmb and the foregrounds : @xmath120 , which is the case for high @xmath0 with more @xmath21 modes in the summation of . for low @xmath0",
    ", however , the @xmath104 plays a major role . in the bottom panel of we use the mean value of the @xmath121 from dilc and foreground maps in as input , and run @xmath122 monte carlo simulations for the @xmath104 .",
    "the foreground contamination is illustrated by the ratio @xmath123 at the values of 1 , 2 and 3 @xmath4 thresholds ( yellow , light blue and dark blue areas , respectively ) .",
    "note that the foreground contamination shown in this way is independent of the underlying cmb power spectrum , and we assume the foreground residuals in the dilc map has the same morphology as the foregrounds themselves , so we are estimating an upper limit on the contamination ratio .     +   +",
    "in this paper we have proceeded from the basic assumption that the cmb should have no or little correlation ( within cosmic variance limit ) with the foregrounds , to examine foreground contamination in the dilc map .",
    "we use the newly - developed representation 1dfr of the spherical harmonic coefficients for cross and peak correlation .",
    "the 1dfr has an advantage in that the @xmath41 modes do not alter the morphology , and when using the standard definition of cross correlation of the 1d curves , they are intrinsically excluded in the calculation .",
    "we have tested the dilc map for @xmath1 , although any diagnostics of correlation can be applied to all @xmath0 modes for both the and the upcoming data .",
    "we find that eight out of nine modes are negatively - correlated , for which the probability is only 0.0176 if they are really independent .",
    "we also find the local extrema of the 1dfr curves are correlated , particularly for @xmath3 and 6 modes , with significance level less than @xmath124 .",
    "both analyses have indicated that the dilc quadrupole is contaminated with foregrounds ( with cross correlation coefficient @xmath125 and extremum statistics at significance level @xmath126 ) .",
    "we then used the cross correlation coefficients to explore the level of the foreground contamination .",
    "the axiom that the cmb has no correlation with the foregrounds provides the most fundamental criterion that should be applied as a foreground cleaning check before any gaussianity tests are performed and cosmologists get carried away by suggestions of new physics .",
    "we suggest that for the upcoming mission , one should not ignore the kind of information we have presented here , before any scientific conclusion is reached .",
    "one final remark for our results is that the dilc map is derived from the concept of minimum variance optimization under the _ a priori _ assumption that cmb and the foregrounds are statistically independent .",
    "that we have only one universe , hence there is inevitably accidental correlation shall introduce some error in the estimation of the weighting coefficients , and consequently introduce residuals in the resultant map . even if the correlation between the cmb and the foregrounds happens to be zero ,",
    "the variance of the foreground residuals is minimum , but not necessarily zero .",
    "although we can extract the angular power spectrum as close as possible to that of the cmb using such methods , the signal obtained in general still contains residuals .",
