    "the reaction pathways involving polymerase(pol)-@xmath2 in eukaryotic cells , which have high fidelity and specificity are presently one of the most subtle scientific information needed to elucidate what constitute the origin of pol-@xmath2 specificity and fidelity  @xcite .",
    "we chose the eukaryotic enzyme pol-@xmath2 here for two obvious reasons it is one of the simplest and smallest ( 39 kda ) known dna polymerase enzyme , and it has been well - studied both experimentally and _ via _ simulations since the 1970s  @xcite .",
    "radhakrishnan and schlick  @xcite , and alberts , wang and schlick  @xcite have carried out the constrained quantum / molecular mechanical calculations to obtain the relevant pol-@xmath2 dna replication pathways with the lowest energies . here ,",
    "`` constrained '' means certain variables are computationally made not - to - float , following the crystal structure data reported by batra _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , and from their earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "the constrained variables include the position and the numbers of water molecules and ions ( mg@xmath3 , na@xmath4 and cl@xmath5 ) , the charge states and the conformational changes of the pol-@xmath2 residues ( d190 ( aspartate 190 ) and others ) and the incoming dctp ( deoxyribocytosine 5@xmath0-triphosphate ) , and so on  @xcite .",
    "the crucial result  @xcite is that the initial deprotonation of the terminal dna primer @xmath6o3@xmath0h group to a water molecule occur concurrently with the nucleophilic attack of @xmath6o3@xmath0 on p@xmath7 catalyzed by mg@xmath3 ions .",
    "note that we have used @xmath8 and @xmath9 instead of 5 + and 2@xmath10 for the phosphorous and oxygen ions , respectively , in order to accommodate the changes of these charges as a result of their changing polarizabilities in the presence of changing interaction strengths .",
    "in fact , we will implement this notation throughout the paper for any element in any molecule without caution .",
    "the readers need not worry about this , because when the time comes , we will identify their magnitudes with a set of properly defined inequalities .",
    "any number that carries a prime ( 3@xmath0 or 5@xmath0 ) refers to a specific carbon atom in a given molecule .",
    "all the computational analyses thus far focused on the `` pre- and post - chemistry avenues '' , which also correspond to the close- and open - conformations of pol-@xmath2 and dna complex  @xcite . in these reports",
    "@xcite , several responsible reaction - pathways were proposed entirely based on these avenues , disregarding the biochemical reaction route ( with the highest specificity and fidelity ) in the chemical process itself , sandwiched between those two avenues ( for more information , please refer the section , additional notes , given prior to conclusion ) . tracking this route ( within the chemical process )",
    "is far more efficient as there can only be a limited number of reaction routes to initiate the nucleophilic attack that could insert a single base to the growing dna strand .",
    "therefore , it is technically easier , accurate and reliable if we could exploit the information obtained from this chemical process to narrow down the processes in the pre- and post - chemistry avenues . here",
    "we make use of the ionization energy theory  @xcite and the energy - level spacing renormalization group method  @xcite to evaluate the van der waals ( vdw ) interaction of a stronger type , down to the electronic level .",
    "we will show that such an evaluation will lead us to find the exclusive biochemical reaction ( assisted by ( i ) the hermansson blue - shifting hydrogen bond  @xcite and ( ii ) the arunan composite hydrogen - vdw bond  @xcite effects ) with the highest specificity and fidelity , in the presence of the correct watson - crick hydrogen bonds  @xcite .",
    "here , we first introduce the ionization energy theory ( iet ) and its approximation , which are needed to renormalize the vdw interaction , and to determine the average atomic energy - level spacing .",
    "this is followed by the introduction to the renormalized vdw interaction , which will be shown to be responsible for the ( bio)chemical reactions if this vdw is of a stronger type , much stronger than the standard vdw interaction that has a @xmath11 dependence , where @xmath12 is the separation between two nuclei .",
    "our analyses here use the ionization energy approximation , which can be understood in a straightforward manner if we start from the iet - schr@xmath13dinger equation  @xcite , @xmath14\\psi(\\textbf{r},t ) = h_{\\rm iet}\\psi(\\textbf{r},t ) \\nonumber \\\\&= & ( e_0 \\pm \\xi)\\psi(\\textbf{r},t ) , \\label{eq : in14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the time - dependent many - body wave function , @xmath16 , @xmath17 denotes the planck constant and @xmath18 is the mass of electron .",
    "the most important parameter here is the eigenvalue , @xmath19 , which is the real ( true and unique ) energy levels for a given quantum system ( an atom or a molecule or a solid or anything in between ) . equation  ( [ eq : in14 ] ) reduces to the standard schr@xmath13dinger equation by noting that @xmath20 , which is exact by definition , and it is not trivial  @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath21 is the energy levels at zero temperature and in the absence of any external disturbances .",
    "this means that @xmath21 is a constant , while @xmath22 is known as the ionization energy ( or the energy - level spacing ) where @xmath23 refers to electrons and holes , respectively . in this work",
    ", @xmath24 does not play any role for an obvious reason , but holes ( positive charge carriers ) can play a vital role in biomolecules as proven experimentally by fujitsuka and majima  @xcite with respect to charge transfer in dna .",
    "there are two formal proofs for the ionization energy approximation .",
    "the first one is indirect and reads , @xmath25 , available in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the second formal proof is direct ( and is based on logic ) and it is associated to the excitation probability of electrons and holes within the ionization energy based fermi - dirac statistics  @xcite .",
    "the ionization energy approximation reads @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the real energy level spacings of a particular quantum system . in the most general sense , @xmath28 is defined to be the real energy spacings between energy levels such that an electron from one energy level needs to overcome an energy cost when that electron tries to occupy another energy level . in molecules , @xmath28 refers to the energy level spacing between an occupied level ( in the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) ) and an empty level ( in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) ) , which is the molecular energy level spacing . due to",
    "the above definition for @xmath28 , the quantum matter discussed in this work refers to molecules .",
    "now , we can readily predict the changes to @xmath27 if we know @xmath29 , where the values for @xmath29 can be obtained from the experimental atomic spectra available in refs .",
    "for example , @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the ionization energy approximation becomes exact if the quantum matter are atoms or ions because @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , we can also prove why an atomic hydrogen takes up the role of a cation in a water molecule , while an oxygen atom ends up as an anion . to prove this",
    ", we need to verify @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 , which can be confirmed from refs .",
    "@xcite where @xmath32 ( 1312 kjmol@xmath35 ) @xmath33 @xmath34 ( 2351 kjmol@xmath35 ) . here , the averaging follows eq .",
    "( [ eq:24b ] ) ( given below ) .",
    "this inequality also proves that the formation of o@xmath36h is never possible .",
    "therefore , an atomic hydrogen gives up ( donates ) its electron to an oxygen atom , and this process is never the other way round ( having oxygen as a donor ) because there is always a stronger coulomb attraction between the electron from h and the oxygen nucleus . in other words , if @xmath28 is larger for atomic a compared to atomic b , then the nucleus of atomic a will always attract the valence electrons from atomic b with a stronger coulomb force , and not _ vice versa _",
    "this reinforces the idea that an atomic hydrogen acts as a cation , whereas , an oxygen atom takes up the role of an anion , in a system consists of h and o. consequently , one can use this ( ionization energy ) approximation to evaluate the changing interaction strengths between two atoms or ions from different molecules .",
    "however , the bonds between atoms do not necessarily involve a single valence electron from each atom , and thus , we need to average the ionization energies for atoms that donate ( or share ) more than one electron . in this case",
    ", the ionization energy averaging follows @xmath37 where each subscript @xmath38 represents one chemical element ( @xmath39 ) in a particular molecule , while @xmath40 , where @xmath41 counts the number of valence electrons coming from each chemical element .",
    "for example , if @xmath42 = p such that p forms five bonds with its nearest neighbors , then p @xmath43 p@xmath44 , and therefore , @xmath45 the first , second , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ionization energies ( prior to averaging ) were obtained from refs .",
    "@xcite . for a water molecule ,",
    "@xmath42 = h and @xmath48 = o. it is to be noted here that the ionization energy theory was first formally proven to be a renormalized theory within the energy - level spacing renormalization group method  @xcite .",
    "this energy - level spacing renormalization procedure can be related exactly to the shankar renormalization technique within the screened coulomb potential derivation , and his renormalization method is documented here  @xcite . further experimental supports for iet and its applications can be found here  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the importance of ionic valence states on the electronic transport properties of oxides and magnetic semiconductors was first experimentally proven by mahendiran _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , the computational ( using the density functional theory ) proof was given by mahadevan and zunger  @xcite , while the theoretical proofs ( using iet ) have been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in these reports",
    "@xcite , the valence state of any cation is shown to vary depending on its surrounding .",
    "therefore , our averaging procedure explained earlier , properly takes the valence - state effect into account .",
    "the `` surrounding '' here refers to the nearest , and the next nearest neighbors only , such that these neighbors are directly bonded to this cation . for a given biochemical process",
    "however , the `` surrounding '' also needs to consider the neighbors that are not directly bonded to a cation or an anion .",
    "this additional interaction originating from the non - bonding neighbors can be taken into account by means of changing interaction strength between two atoms or ions ( see below for details ) .",
    "earlier , we have justified why the ionization energy approximation allows us to track the interaction strength between atoms from different molecules . here",
    ", we need to capture that an increasing attractive strength between two atoms can lead to a ( bio)chemical reaction . to do that",
    ", we need to develop a new vdw formalism that allow a stronger coulomb attraction between two atoms ( or ions ) for all @xmath49 where @xmath12 is the separation between two nuclei , @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the radii of two interacting atoms or ions  @xcite .",
    "this stronger coulomb attraction has been captured using the renormalized vdw formalism , and the relevant formula is  @xcite @xmath52 } , \\label{eq:1.2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath53 denotes the ground state energy ( of a given molecule ) in the absence of external disturbances , and for @xmath54k , and @xmath55 is the stronger version of the attractive vdw interaction , after renormalization  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath55 is negative guaranteed by the inequality @xmath56 and the attractive coulomb interaction between an electron and a nucleus is also negative by definition . here , @xmath57 is the planck constant divided by 2@xmath58 , @xmath59 , in which , @xmath60 is the bohr radius of atomic hydrogen , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the electron charge and the permittivity of free space , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note here that arunan _",
    "et al_. were the first to point out the existence of a composite bond that consists of hydrogen bond and the vdw attraction  @xcite , which has been captured by eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.2 ] ) by means of the generalized vdw interaction .",
    "the detailed derivation for @xmath55 , its physical insights and why it is suitable for both long and short distances are given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) has been proven to be stronger than the standard vdw prediction due to the existence of an asymmetric polarization between two atoms .",
    "the relevant equation that associates @xmath28 to the atomic displacement polarization is given by  @xcite @xmath63}{(\\omega_{\\rm{ph}}^2 - \\omega^2)}\\bigg ] , \\label{eq:1.2polar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the electric - field dependent frequency due to valence - electron displacement , @xmath65 denotes the phonon frequency of undeformable ions ( mass , @xmath66 ) and @xmath67 is the fermi energy at zero kelvin . a stronger polarization exists",
    "if the two atoms have very different ionization energy values such that @xmath68 where atomic a will become a cation , while atomic b assumes the role of an anion based on iet .",
    "presently  @xcite , and usually , this asymmetric polarization are assumed to be static ( by assigning fixed charges to atoms or ions ) and therefore , the interaction between any two ions are electrostatic .",
    "for example , the red- and blue - shifted hydrogen bonds were determined entirely from the step - by - step changes to the distance between the supposedly hydrogen - bonded atoms  @xcite .",
    "it is physically alright to assume the charges assigned to the atoms of a particular molecule to be static where this assumption can be used to determine the electrostatic dipole - dipole , dipole - induced dipole and/or the london dispersion forces .",
    "for example , the above stated interactions can become stronger or weaker entirely from the step - by - step changes to the separation between two strongly interacting atoms ( @xmath12 ) , however , this assumption ( by definition ) ignores the systematic changes to the atomic polarization when @xmath12 changes .",
    "the above mentioned atomic polarization and the vdw forces are often treated as adjustable parameters in the _ ab - initio _ quantum mechanical calculations , and also in molecular dynamical simulations  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in any _ ab - initio _ quantum mechanical calculations , polarization functions are introduced by hand to allow some variations to the atomic orbitals in order to evaluate the molecular integrals .",
    "for example , within the gaussian basis set formalism , each basis function ( indicated with a subscript `` @xmath69 '' ) represents a normalized linear combination of a few gaussians , namely , the contracted gaussian  @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the contraction coefficient , the primitive gaussian based on the cartesian coordinate ( centered on atom b ) , @xmath72 and the cartesian - gaussian normalization constant , @xmath73^{1/2}. \\label{eq : ira3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ira1 ] ) ,  ( [ eq : ira2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : ira3 ] ) are designed ( not through an _ ab - initio _ method ) to allow polarizations where @xmath41 , @xmath38 and @xmath74 are nonnegative integers , @xmath75 is an orbital exponent , and @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 are cartesian coordinates such that the nucleus b is the origin . when @xmath79 , one has the @xmath80-type gaussian , while the polarizable @xmath81- and @xmath82-type gaussians can be obtained for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ira1 ] ) represents the guessed linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) , which allow distortions such that an atomic orbital s ( ao ) shape and its center of charge can be shifted upon the formation of a molecule , by requiring @xmath85 .",
    "the point is , the above ao with @xmath85 are introduced at the outset by hand , and these ao - functions ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ira1 ] ) ) are not determined from any _ ab - initio _ quantum mechanical calculation or derivation  @xcite , and therefore , we can now understand why the parameters associated to polarizations were treated as variationally adjustable parameters  @xcite .    as a consequence ,",
    "we need to find an alternative way to understand how and why the change in the polarization strength can influence the blue- or red shifting hydrogen bond ( or the generalized vdw interaction ) , in the presence of another ion .",
    "these information can be extracted from the _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations by imposing some guessed ao - functions ( eq .  ( [ eq : ira1 ] ) ) at the outset , and then treat the parameters related to polarizations as variationally adjustable . in our approach ,",
    "the polarizations are determined directly without any inbuilt guessed functions or adjustable parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "if one considers an electrostatic interaction , then an induced polarization can change the charge magnitude that was originally assigned to an ion , making such an assumption inadequate to study chemical reactions . here",
    ", we will use the ionization energy approximation and the renormalized vdw theory to tackle the polarization effect that is responsible to initiate a chemical reaction between two strongly interacting atoms ( or ions ) from different molecules . in the following analyses",
    ", we will show that the changes in the polarization caused by different surrounding molecules give rise to the corresponding changes to the partial charges of the reactant atoms .",
    "these changes in the partial charges assigned to reactant atoms or ions ( from different molecules ) can lead to a lock - in configuration , which can proceed to a chemical reaction , if the configuration has the strongest coulomb attraction .      here",
    ", we apply iet and the new vdw formula to evaluate the formation of a peptide bond between two @xmath86-amino acids , @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes an organic substituent , which is irrelevant here .",
    "the analyses presented here involve inequalities , but they are sufficient to achieve our objective to unambiguously determine the correct biochemical reaction pathway , without the need to compute any numbers ( apart from the ionization energy averaging ) .    the condensation reaction ( given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.2b ] ) ) is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] where the dashed arrows indicate the correct reaction pathways .",
    "the alternative reaction pathways can involve c@xmath89 , o@xmath90 , h@xmath90 and h@xmath91 ( not shown ) .",
    "you are kindly advised to refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a much simpler system , in which the system consists of only one water molecule and a surface oxygen atom .",
    "our strategy here is to track this condensation reaction pathway that has the strongest interaction ( such that @xmath92 from eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.2 ] ) is maximum ) .",
    "this means that , a chemical reaction occurs continuously until completion or equilibrium ( provided the external conditions to initiate this reaction are met ) , guided entirely by the changing instantaneous interaction strengths ( mostly due to electron - electron and electron - ion types ) , not because the reactants are `` consciously aware '' that their final destination or products ( after the chemical reaction ) will have a smaller free - energy , or maximum entropy , or energetically more stable .",
    "there are five possibilities for two @xmath86-amino acids to react ( ignoring @xmath88 ) , but only one of the reaction pathways is responsible for the formation of a peptide bond .",
    "we have evaluated all the reaction pathways , but we only highlight the correct reaction pathway ( indicated with dashed arrows in fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) as a benchmark analysis .",
    "both the correct and the incorrect reaction pathways for dipeptide bond formation are similar to the reaction pathways discussed for pol-@xmath2 dna replication ( given in the following section ) .    the polarized charges ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) for the relevant atoms in an isolated amino acid can be determined using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : in14b ] ) and  ( [ eq:24b ] ) , while table  [ table : i ] lists all the ionization - energy values required for our analyses . from these two inequalities , @xmath93(2129 kjmol@xmath35 ) @xmath94 @xmath95(1312 kjmol@xmath35 ) and @xmath96(4078 kjmol@xmath35 ) @xmath94 @xmath97(3571 kjmol@xmath35 ) , we can conclude that n is negatively charged , n@xmath6 , h@xmath89 is positively charged , h@xmath98 , while c@xmath89 is slightly negatively charged , c@xmath99 because even though h@xmath90 contributes an electron to c@xmath89 , the negative charge due to this electron ( from h@xmath90 ) is compensated by the electron ( from c@xmath89 ) that is polarized toward n to create a covalent bond with n. this electron from c@xmath89 is actually asymmetrically polarized toward n due to @xmath96(4078 kjmol@xmath35 ) @xmath94 @xmath97(3571 kjmol@xmath35 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath100 @xmath94 @xmath101 and @xmath102 @xmath94 @xmath103 .",
    "in addition , a c  c bond gives rise to an isotropic polarization ( because @xmath104 ) , and thus , c does not gain any charge ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) by making bonds with another c. however , c@xmath105 is positively charged because @xmath97(3571 kjmol@xmath35 ) @xmath33",
    "@xmath106(4368 kjmol@xmath107 , and no charge contribution from c@xmath89 to c@xmath90 due to isotropic polarization .",

    "h@xmath112 first interacts with o@xmath113 , which further polarizes the o@xmath113 electrons ( contributed by c@xmath114 and h@xmath115 ) much closer to o@xmath113 .",
    "moreover , the electron contributed by h@xmath98 to n@xmath6 is now more polarized closer to n@xmath6 because h@xmath98 now attracts an electron from o@xmath113 originally contributed by c@xmath114 .",
    "these induced polarizations imply that @xmath116 @xmath94 @xmath117 and @xmath118 @xmath94 @xmath119 , where h@xmath120o@xmath89 denotes the vdw attraction within the generalized vdw formalism . within the hydrogen - bond formalism",

    "next we show that the above charge inequalities ( due to induced polarizations ) will lead us to a lock - in configuration , which sets the stage for chemical reactions .    the lock - in configuration",
    "is obtained when h@xmath98 interacts with o@xmath113 and when n@xmath122 interacts with c@xmath123 where the strength of these interactions follow eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.2 ] ) .",
    "we can now use the ionization energy approximation to calculate the relevant values , namely , @xmath124 = 317 kjmol@xmath35 and @xmath125 = 2 kjmol@xmath35 , and therefore , the @xmath126 is 317 + 2 = 319 kjmol@xmath35 , which is the highest compared to any other alternative combinations of atoms shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "this highest value also gives the highest interaction strength when it is substituted into eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.2 ] ) .",
    "but this is only one - half of the requirement for the condensation reaction to proceed .",
    "the other half comes from the stronger bonds between c@xmath123 and o@xmath99 and between n@xmath127 and h@xmath98 .",
    "the bond between c@xmath123 and o@xmath99 is stronger because the electron from c@xmath123 is polarized closer to o@xmath113 in the presence of h@xmath98 .",
    "meanwhile , the n@xmath127h@xmath98 bond has also become stronger because the electron from h@xmath112 is now polarized much closer to n@xmath127 in the presence of o@xmath113 .",
    "in other words , these two bonds have become stronger because they are in certain polarized modes , which are actually best suited to initiate selective chemical reactions compared to unpolarized bonds .",
    "for example , it is relatively easy to break a polarized bond via an electron and/or a proton transfer . on the contrary ,",
    "unpolarized bonding electrons are more homogeneously distributed in a given molecule , and therefore , the charges for atoms within the molecule ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) are either too small or negligible to initiate a proper and strong lock - in configuration . in the polarized modes",
    "however , atoms ( in a molecule ) have large polarized charges ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) , which can strongly interact with other atoms or ions from another molecule .",
    "note here that thermal energy is not useful to set up a lock - in configuration because thermal energy causes non - selective electron polarizations where it will excite all the bonding electrons homogeneously in a given molecule .",
    "hence , thermal energy can be a useful source of energy required for continuous reactions and/or to keep the activation energy lower so that a given reaction ( in certain polarized modes ) can proceed .",
    "we have identified these two bonds , c@xmath123o@xmath99 and n@xmath127h@xmath98 are stronger as a result of selective atomic polarizations . in other words , these bonds are more difficult to be broken by applying thermal energy , but they are more easily broken if we could lure these charged atoms with opposite charges ( with an electron or a proton ) .",
    "in particular , the above stronger bonds will lead c@xmath123 to strongly interact with n@xmath127 , while o@xmath113 is strongly interacting with h@xmath98 .",
    "all we need now are some external energy supply ( thermal energy for example ) to initiate the simultaneous electron and proton transfers , namely an electron - transfer from n@xmath127 to c@xmath123 and a proton - transfer , h@xmath98 to o@xmath113 .",
    "these transfers are likely to proceed compared to other combinations of atoms , which have been predicted from the ionization energy approximation presented earlier .",
    "this lock - in configuration has the strongest attraction , which requires the minimal external energy supply ( due to the lowest activation energy ) .",
    "the simultaneous electron and proton transfers will complete the condensation reaction , giving rise to a dipeptide and a water molecule as reaction products .    in summary ,",
    "the charge ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) redistribution ( due to polarization ) in atoms have given rise to a lock - in configuration , and subsequently have led to simultaneous electron and proton transfers in such a way that a new peptide bond is formed between n@xmath127 and c@xmath123 , while the n@xmath127h@xmath98 covalent bond is broken . on the other hand ,",
    "a new o@xmath99h@xmath112 bond is formed , while the c@xmath123o@xmath99 bond is broken .",
    "we can now move on and use the acquired knowledge to tackle the pol-@xmath2 dna replication .",
    "schlick _ et al_.  @xcite found the nucleophilic attack , a1 runs simultaneously with a2 to b3 proton transfers .",
    "in contrast , we show here with unequivocal theoretical analyses that a direct deprotonation of h@xmath4 from o3@xmath0h to o3@xmath1 ( a3@xmath1 pathway ) and the a1 pathway are activated simultaneously . this concurrent process ( with steps a1 and a3@xmath1 )",
    "is chemically driven ( initiated by a stronger vdw interaction ) with the highest specificity and fidelity ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "this direct deprotonation is also somewhat similar to abashkin , erickson and burt  @xcite , in which , the difference being their  @xcite direct proton transfer is from o3@xmath0h to o2@xmath1 , and then to o3@xmath1 ( after bond - rotation ) .",
    "we use the blue - shifting vdw interaction between electrons from different molecules  @xcite , or from different sections of a bigger molecule , as a determining factor for biochemical reactions , which completes one base - pair ( cg ) to the growing dna strand .",

    "interestingly , the band structure and energy levels of proteins have also been suggested to be useful to understand proteins electronic interaction  @xcite .",
    "here , we will track the above interaction strengths so as to understand why and how the nucleophilic attack proceeds with a unique path .",
    "in fact , there is only one approach that is well - defined and allows one to expose the chain of events leading to this exclusive path occurring at the critical point , which was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to capture the origin of a single water - molecule splitting on a mgo surface .",
    "the formal proofs that justify this approach are given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "add to that , these interaction strengths that we will be tracking are directly related to the ionization energy theory ( iet ) and the renormalization group method , which are also mathematically well - defined  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our analyses can be made quantitative by invoking the ionization energy approximation , which gives us the license to claim that the molecular energy level spacings are directly proportional to the atomic energy level spacings of all the atom exist in a given molecule  @xcite .",
    "the atomic ionization energies of all the atoms in a molecule is of course different from the molecular ionization energies of that particular molecule .",
    "they are different because the atomic energy levels will have to transform ( due to wave function transformation ) during a chemical reaction to form the molecular energy levels  @xcite .",
    "however , the energy level spacings of a molecule containing certain atoms has been proven to be proportional ( not equal ) to the averaged atomic energy level spacings of all the isolated atoms present in that particular molecule  @xcite .",
    "what we need to do now is to first understand the chain of events giving rise to the validity of the steps , a1 and a2 within iet . when the negatively charged @xmath6o3@xmath0 comes closer to p@xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , the @xmath6o3@xmath0h@xmath128 bond is further reinforced , which is the effect we discovered in ref .",
    "the reason is that the electrons contributed by h and carbon to create the o3@xmath0h and o3@xmath0carbon covalent bonds are now being strongly bound to o3@xmath0 in the presence of p@xmath7 , which pulls these electrons further away from carbon and h ( from now on , we denote this specific hydrogen as h@xmath0 ) .",
    "the @xmath6o3@xmath0@xmath128h@xmath0 covalent bond is necessarily stronger due to induced electrostatic interaction between @xmath6o3@xmath0 and p@xmath1 .",
    "the reason is that the bonding electron ( contributed by h@xmath0 ) is now more polarized toward @xmath6o3@xmath0 due to p@xmath1 , and this will necessarily result in a stronger @xmath6o3@xmath0@xmath128h@xmath0 covalent bond .",
    "logical proof : the above covalent bond has to get stronger , or weaker , and definitely , its strength can not remain the same in the presence of p@xmath7 . here , all other conditions from the pre - chemistry avenue are relatively weak .",
    "they are weak because in the chemical stage , these external effects coming from the pre - chemistry avenue do not directly involve in the chemical reaction . of course , the molecules , ions and the residues from the pre - chemistry avenue do set the stage for the chemical reaction to proceed , but they do not directly involve in the nucleophilic attack as reactants .",
    "now , let us assume the said bond ( @xmath6o3@xmath0@xmath128h@xmath0 ) gets weaker in the presence of p@xmath7 , and this is only possible if the bonding electron from h@xmath0 is weakly polarized toward o3@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , one can immediately deduce that this leads to a contradiction because the bonding electron contributed by h@xmath0 , has to be more polarized toward o3@xmath0 due to the attractive induced interaction between p@xmath7 and @xmath6o3@xmath0 .",
    "consequently , it is energetically inconvenient to break this stronger o3@xmath0h@xmath0 covalent bond by brute force ( by thermal energy ) , such as the electronic excitation of the ( o3@xmath0h ) bonding electron , which is now strongly polarized toward p@xmath7 .",
    "therefore , it would be easier by allowing the oxygen ( o@xmath129 ) from a nearby water molecule to form the required hydrogen bond ( between o@xmath130 and h@xmath0 ) that can easily blue shift ( _ via _ the hermansson blue - shifting hydrogen bond effect ) due to an attractive interaction between o3@xmath0 and p@xmath1 .",
    "let us rephrase the last sentence due to its extreme importance and also because of its far - reaching effect in biological systems .",
    "the stronger covalent bond between o3@xmath0 and h@xmath0 is due to the attractive interaction between o3@xmath0 and p@xmath1 , and is actually more easily breakable , not by brute force , but when it is subjected to an induced electrostatic interaction provided by the o@xmath129 from a water molecule .",
    "this means that , the original covalent bond between o3@xmath0 and h@xmath0 is not easily breakable by a water molecule in the absence of the attractive interaction between o3@xmath0 and p@xmath1 . the readers are kindly advised to remember this point , or recall the theoretical method section as we will not stress it again when used later .",
    "now , back to hermansson , we know that her blue - shifting interaction can initiate the radhakrishnan - schlick deprotonation ( step a2 ) .",
    "unfortunately , due to this deprotonation ( losing h@xmath0 to a water molecule ) , one now requires some external energy from an unknown source ( this could be some additional heat or interaction ) to overcome the activation energy and initiate the nucleophilic attack ( a1 ) .",
    "in other words , by having h@xmath0 bonded to o3@xmath0 , one has the strongest interaction between the bonding electron ( coming from o3@xmath0h@xmath0 ) and the nucleus of p@xmath7 leading to smaller activation energy . to see why and how this activation energy is smaller",
    ", we just need to wait a bit longer because we need to introduce and build the arguments properly .",
    "anyway , the other subsequent proton transfers will not be captured with iet because these latter paths , b1 to b3 are similar to the hydrogen - bonding mechanism stated above , and they are not unique .",
    "they are not unique because even though these steps , a1 , a2 and b1 to b3 require minimal total energy compared to other pathways ( that involve different residues and so on ) , one can always manipulate any number of pathways to further reduce the minimal total energy .",
    "for example , we can have a direct deprotonation from the h@xmath36o- - -h@xmath0 to one of the oxygen in the outgoing pyrophosphate without involving d190 , by manipulating the `` constrained '' parameters . here , the dashed lines , `` - - - '' means a hydrogen bond , ``  '' denotes a covalent bond , and `` = '' is a double covalent bond used in text .",
    "in contrast , we prove here the existence of a unique reaction pathway that consists of two simultaneous steps , ( a1 ) @xmath6o3@xmath0 attacks p@xmath7 while ( a3@xmath1 ) @xmath6o3@xmath1 counterattacks @xmath128h@xmath0 ( from o3@xmath0 ) that has the highest specificity and fidelity",
    ". we will also explain why and how these steps are strategically interdependent that make them exclusive .",
    "but before we dig deep , let us first properly introduce the ionization energy approximation relevant to this work .",
    "the origin of these charges , @xmath9 and @xmath8 are due to their respective polarization , which can be understood from the average atomic ionization energy ( @xmath28 ) values  @xcite . here",
    ", large ionization energy value implies large energy needed to polarize or to excite the electron from its initial or ground state .",
    "for example , one can obtain the average ionization energy values from table  [ table : i ]  @xcite and write @xmath131  kjmol@xmath35 ) @xmath132",
    "kjmol@xmath35 ) , and therefore , h and o are indeed positively and negatively charged , as they should be .",
    "this inequality proves that oxygen can never be a cation in water molecules .",
    "using the same arguments , we can obtain the inequality , @xmath133 @xmath134 , which is also true for all individual ( 1@xmath135 , @xmath136 , 5@xmath137 ) ionization energies ( see table  [ table : i ] ) to justify the type of charges ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) carried by these elements , p@xmath7 and o@xmath6 in the 5@xmath0-triphosphate group .",
    "up to this point , it is true that we have no constrained parameters to handle because we deliberately ignored them , not because ignorance is bliss , but to keep all the analyses exact and unambiguous within the chemical process , sandwiched between the pre- and post - chemistry avenues .",
    "the complex processes and their numerous possibilities involved in these avenues necessitate the introduction of constrained parameters .",
    "to avoid such parameters , the chemical process is isolated , which is theoretically valid because the interactions during this closing and opening stages , do not directly involve in the biochemical reactions that insert a base to the growing dna strand .",
    "thus , in the following paragraphs , our strategy is to first implement this isolation correctly , and then discuss the possibility of carrying out the pre- and post - chemistry investigations subject to the exclusive biochemical reaction pathway .",
    "apart from the well - known nucleophilic attack ( a1 pathway ) , there are four other possible chemical reactions that correspond to four oxygen atoms bonded to p@xmath1 , namely , p@xmath1o3@xmath1p , p@xmath1@xmath138o2@xmath1 , p@xmath1o  carbon , and p@xmath1o@xmath139 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig:3]a to d ) , in which only one of them should occur simultaneously ( with a1 ) .",
    "apparently , we need to eliminate any three of them by considering each in turn , and then prove a3@xmath1 has the highest specificity and fidelity .",
    "we have to warn the readers that the following analyses are entirely analytic and are inevitably subtle , plagued by different magnitudes of polarization for the element , p@xmath1 , and the four oxygen atoms bonded to p@xmath1 in the presence of o3@xmath0 , h@xmath0 , p ( valid only for the oxygen in p@xmath1o3@xmath1p ) and carbon ( valid only for the oxygen in p@xmath1o  carbon ) .    from the ionization energy approximation ( given earlier )",
    ", we can understand the validity of the assigned charges in p@xmath7o@xmath6carbon@xmath128 , and consequently the steps , a1 and a3@xmath1 are also correct from the induced coulomb interaction between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "of course , this induced interaction has a deep microscopic origin , which will activate the required chemical reactions to extend the dna strand .",
    "but it is sufficient to consider only the partial charges now ( without going into the details ) , to rule out the three out of the four steps listed above , and to find the crucial oxygen atom ( bonded to p@xmath1 ) that interact with the strongest induced interaction with h@xmath0 .",
    "once the correct oxygen is identified , we can then go on and exploit the existence of the renormalized vdw interaction of a stronger type ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.2 ] ) ) that is responsible for the simultaneous nucleophilic attack a1 , and the counterattack a3@xmath1 .",
    "the nucleophilic- and the counter - attack depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a to d are due to an induced attractive electrostatic interaction between @xmath6o3@xmath0 and p@xmath7 .",
    "this induced interaction is a prerequisite to form a new covalent bond ( @xmath6o3@xmath0p@xmath7 ) , which can be obtained from the stronger vdw interaction ( see eq .",

    "( [ eq:1.2 ] ) , we can go on to untangle each chemical step ( sandwiched between the pre- and post - chemistry avenues ) involved during the base , c insertion ( from dctp ) , and find the crucial oxygen ( bonded to p@xmath1 ) that strongly interact with h@xmath0 during the nucleophilic attack .",
    "the moment @xmath6o3@xmath0 unleashes its polarizable electron on p@xmath7 , @xmath6o3@xmath1 strikes back instantaneously , attacking @xmath128h@xmath0 . as a matter of fact , these nucleophilic- and counter - attacks are simultaneous to the extent that one can also view it in the reverse attacking order . but",

    "all bonds are predominantly covalent - type , unless stated otherwise .    the chemical steps depicted in fig .",

    "this interdependence is actually initiated by a stronger vdw attraction between o3@xmath0 and p@xmath1 , and between o3@xmath1 and h@xmath0 with further assistance from the hermansson blue - shifting hydrogen bond effect . the formation of these bonds , p@xmath1o3@xmath0 and h@xmath0o3@xmath1 are assisted by the hermansson blue - shifting hydrogen bond effect , at least for the bond , h@xmath0o3@xmath1 . whereas , the formation of p@xmath1o3@xmath0 bond is due to the hermansson - like blue - shifting hydrogen bond effect .",

    "there is no difference in the partial charge between @xmath6o2@xmath1 and @xmath6o3@xmath1 ( @xmath147 = @xmath148 ) because both electrons in each case are contributed by p. however , o2@xmath1=p@xmath1 is a double bond , hence the single p@xmath1o3@xmath1 bond is in fact twice more easily breakable than the stated double bond . unlike the breaking of p@xmath1o3@xmath1 bond in the a3@xmath1 step , the interaction energy from the polarized o3@xmath0 ( during the nucleophilic attack given in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b ) is distributed equally to both bonds , until one of the double bond is broken .",
    "in contrast , for the a3@xmath1 step , the same interaction energy is fully available to break the p@xmath1o3@xmath1 bond alone , reinforced by the counterattack between o3@xmath1 and h@xmath0 .",

    "they do contribute directly in the pre- and post - chemistry avenues , but they do not act as reactants in the chemical stage . hence , in the chemical stage , we can indeed ignore the contribution made by these molecules and ions .",
    "in fact , we can logically rule out the effects coming from the pre - chemistry avenue  any ions or charged atoms ( attached to nearby molecules or residues ) , which are not reactants , will affect all the nearby reactant atoms ( the correct as well as the incorrect ones ) equally _ via _ the electrostatic interaction .",
    "this means that , non - reactant molecules do not discriminate ( not selective ) when they interact _ via _ the coulomb interaction ( be it repulsive or attractive ) with the reactant atoms ( directly or indirectly ) .",
    "interestingly , the effects coming from the pre - chemistry avenue have also been ruled out in ref .",
    "@xcite using some molecular dynamical simulations .",
    "the results reported in refs .",
    "@xcite emphasizes the importance of pre - chemistry effects , but ignore the contribution of different oxygen atoms bonded to p@xmath1 in the chemical stage because there is no counter - attack in their calculations .",
    "this means that , their calculations in the chemical stage do not consider the interactions between h@xmath0 and other oxygen atoms bonded to p@xmath1 because h@xmath0 is lost to a water molecule .",
    "there are two ways to include the effect from the environment(i ) the ions and molecules from the environment affect the relevant polarization of the atoms from the reactant molecules ( such that there is no chemical reaction between them ) before and/or during and/or after the dna replication , or ( ii ) the ions or molecules from the environment chemically react with the reactant molecules before and/or during and/or after the dna replication .",
    "obviously , our work ignores point ( ii ) , but satisfies point ( i ) .",
    "for example , point ( i ) can be shown to reinforce the reaction pathway ( that consists of two steps , a1 and a3@xmath1 ) proposed herein .",

    "this also means that , we did not constrain the position of mg@xmath3 ions in such a way to obtain stronger interaction strength .",
    "point ( ii ) has been considered in refs .",
    "of course , our reaction pathway becomes invalid if there is any chemical reaction between a reactant molecule and a molecule from the environment .",
    "activation energy is the minimum energy needed to initiate a chemical reaction , in which the activation energy exists due to small interaction strength between two reactant species .",
    "this means that , we need to supply external energy to overcome the activation energy or microscopically , we need to increase the interaction strength between two reactant species to initiate the reaction . here",
    ", the reaction energy is the energy needed to complete a reaction ( after overcoming the activation energy ) .",
    "the reaction pathway ( see the steps , a1 and a3@xmath1 in fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) responsible for the dna replication requires breaking and forming of covalent bonds . to initiate the breaking and forming of these bonds",

    "now , the reaction energy is the total energy needed to complete the reaction , in which the reaction will last for as long as the interaction between the reactant species are strong enough to initiate the chemical reaction .",
    "this is why the reaction energy and the activation energy do not correlate , and any correlation between them ( activation and reaction energies ) is just a `` lucky coincidence '' .    in any case",
    ", we have given unambiguous analyses as to why and how the a1 and a3@xmath1 chemical steps have the highest specificity and fidelity , and are precisely interdependent ( with lock - in steps ) , which can be made compatible with contributions from mg@xmath3 ions , pol-@xmath2 residues ( d190 and probably others ) , and water molecules in the pre- and post - chemistry avenues .",
    "our approach guarantees that the lock - in steps are only possible if h@xmath0 stays bonded to o3@xmath0 during the nucleophilic attack .",
    "in conclusion , we have actually attempted to tell an unambiguous and a self - consistent tale of how the electronic structure ( with distinct energy - level spacings ) may influence aging in humans using abstract analyses .",
    "these influences are found to be indirect where the unique ionization energy values determine why and how a selected set of complex biochemical reactions are initiated and executed with negligible errors to maintain healthy eukaryotes . here ,",
    "we have considered only one type of enzyme known as the polymerase-@xmath2 , and a specific biochemical process involving the insertion of a single c base ( from dctp ) into the growing dna strand .",
    "nonetheless , the above influence ( due to ionization energy ) is proven to be significant and far - reaching , such that the stronger renormalized vdw interaction and the hermansson blue - shifting hydrogen bond effect are applicable to all biochemical processes .",
    "for example , these two interactions are responsible to set up the lock - in configuration that has the strongest coulomb attraction .",
    "we have proven that there is only one unique biochemical process , consisting of two steps with the highest specificity and fidelity .",
    "these steps are strongly interdependent to the extent that they can be regarded as lock - in steps , occurring simultaneously . in particular , the nucleophilic attack starts when the o3@xmath0 uses its polarizable electron to attract the positively charged p@xmath1 by means of a stronger vdw interaction .",
    "this step leads to a stronger o3@xmath0h@xmath0 bond , which becomes easily susceptible in the presence of o3@xmath1 . at the same time",
    ", the counterattack between h@xmath0 and o3@xmath1 fortifies the p@xmath1o3@xmath1 bond , which can be easily weakened by subjecting p@xmath1 to o3@xmath0 , and this is nothing but the nucleophilic attack that is being unleashed as we speak . obviously , these ( nucleophilic- and counter- ) attacks complement each other rather nicely in such a way that they lead to the formation of new o3@xmath0p@xmath1 and h@xmath0o3@xmath1 bonds , and the breaking of p@xmath1o3@xmath1 and o3@xmath0h@xmath0 bonds . in addition to this almost perfect",
