    "these systems have the remarkable property of possessing a mapping to a classical multi - component plasma system with highly unusual intra- and inter - component interactions .",
    "the statistical properties of these unconventional plasmas  especially their phase diagrams  have important ramifications for the physics of their corresponding fractional quantum hall systems  @xcite .",
    "the statistical physics of such systems has only recently begun to be explored . in a previous paper , we investigated the metal - insulator transition in a particular version of such a plasma  @xcite . in this paper , we will extend these investigations to a study of the freezing of such a plasma from a liquid to a wigner crystal .    the canonical partition function of the unconventional two - component plasma that we investigate is given by  @xcite @xmath6 where the potential energy @xmath7 describes two species ( components ) of particles interacting via two different types of two - dimensional ( 2d ) coulomb interactions , which are logarithmic . here",

    "the @xmath13 are coordinate vectors for the @xmath9 particles of component @xmath14 , which carry no charge of type 1 and charge @xmath15 of type 2 .",
    "the term @xmath16 describes the interaction of the @xmath10-particles with a uniform density neutralizing background charge .",
    "note that the form given in eq .",
    "implies that the temperature @xmath17 .",
    "this plasma is related  @xcite to inner products of quantum - mechanical trial wave functions of ising - type quantum hall states , such as the moore - read pfaffian  @xcite , anti - pfaffian  @xcite , and bonderson - slingerland hierarchy states  @xcite . for the charge values relevant to these states ,",
    "the plasma was shown to be in its metallic liquid phase  @xcite , which allows for the calculation of the braiding statistics of quasiparticle excitations of these states  @xcite , confirming their conjectured non - abelian statistics .",
    "this plasma is also related to rotating two - component bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in two dimensions  @xcite .    while ref .",
    "focused on the cases @xmath18 , which are particularly relevant for ising - type quantum hall states , here we will investigate the plasma for large values of @xmath11 . in the limit in which @xmath19 , the @xmath14-particles do not interact , and the plasma thus reduces to the standard 2d one - component coulomb plasma ( ocp ) .",
    "it is generally believed that , at high values of @xmath11 , the ocp will be in a 2d solid state in which the charges form a triangular lattice with quasi - long - range translational and long - range orientational order @xcite , as found in the simulations in refs .  .",
    "however , some studies have claimed that there is no low - temperature ( high-@xmath11 ) crystalline state in the ocp , due to the proliferation of screened disclinations  @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the generally - held view is correct ( and we present evidence supporting this view ) , so that there is a low - temperature crystalline state , then the melting of this crystal can occur according to either of two possible scenarios .",
    "one possibility is the kosterlitz - thouless - halperin - nelson - young theory ( kthny )  @xcite , according to which dislocation pairs unbind via a vector - defects version of the bkt transition at a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) like transition .",
    "the system then enters a hexatic liquid phase in which there is no translational order , but there is quasi - long - range hexatic order .",
    "then , there is a second bkt transition at which disclination pairs unbind , hexatic order is lost , and the system enters an isotropic liquid phase .",
    "the other possibility is a direct first - order melting transition at a lower temperature than the kthny - theory predicts  @xcite .",
    "there have been considerable efforts to investigate 2d melting , both experimentally and by numerical simulations .",
    "some studies have found kthny transitions while others have found a weakly first - order melting transition  @xcite .",
    "it appears that the nature of 2d melting depends on details of the interatomic potential . in the case of logarithmic interactions ,",
    "most numerical simulations find a first - order transition  @xcite .    before proceeding to a description of our simulations ,",
    "we mention that , in principle , there is one other possibility : a lifshitz transition from the liquid to a striped or `` microemulsion '' phase and then later to a wigner crystal , as discussed by kivelson and spivak  @xcite .",
    "such a scenario must be considered when there is a linear coupling between the order parameter and the uniform density ( i.e. , between the order parameter at wavevector @xmath20 and the density at wavevector @xmath21 ) or , equivalently , when the first derivative of the energy with respect to the density is discontinuous at the transition . however , in our case , the order parameter is the density at non - zero wavevector , so no such linear coupling can occur .",
    "furthermore , the order parameter vanishes on both sides of the transition since the crystalline phase is only quasi - long - range ordered , so there would be no discontinuity even if there were a linear coupling . however , even in systems to which the kivelson - spivak  @xcite argument applies , there are two possible scenarios , similar to the ones that we consider : a direct first - order phase transition ( which is permitted for the case of logarithmic interactions ) and a continuous transition via one or more intermediate phases .",

    "the distance between two points @xmath23 and @xmath24 is taken to be the chord length @xmath25 and the term @xmath16 is simply a uniform constant that can be disregarded .",

    "moreover , to improve sampling at high values of @xmath11 , we used the parallel tempering algorithm  @xcite , where the set of couplings was found by measuring first - passage - times as described in ref .  .",
    "in addition to the logarithmic interactions , we regularize the attractive interactions by adding a short - range hard - core repulsion such that particles are not permitted to be closer than the particle diameter @xmath29 .",
    "hence , there is a nonzero dimensionless density @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the area of the system .",
    "first , we consider the case in which @xmath19 . this is motivated by the fact that previous studies of the ocp on the surface of a sphere are not consistent . in ref .  , a freezing transition at @xmath2 was found by comparing the free energy of the solid and liquid state .",

    "<S> we study an unconventional two - dimensional , two - component classical plasma on a sphere , with emphasis on detecting signatures of melting transitions . </S>",
    "<S> this system is relevant to ising - type quantum hall states , and is unconventional in the sense that it features particles interacting via two different two - dimensional coulomb interactions . </S>",
    "<S> one species of particles in the plasma carries charge of both types @xmath0 , while the other species carries only charge of the second type @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find signatures of a freezing transition at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the species with charge of both types will form a wigner crystal , whereas the species with charge of the second type also shows signatures of being a wigner crystal , due to the attractive inter - component interaction of the second type . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there is also a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless phase transition at @xmath3 , at which the two species of particles bind to form molecules that are neutral with respect to the second coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> these two transitions appear to be independent of each other , giving a rectangular phase diagram . as a special case , @xmath4 describes the ( conventional ) two - dimensional one - component plasma . </S>",
    "<S> our study is consistent with previous studies of this plasma , and sheds new light on the freezing transition of this system . </S>"
