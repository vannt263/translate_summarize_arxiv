    "there is a long list of papers on one - dimensional interface growth models ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) . in most of them",

    "two typical gapless phases are encountered : the edwards - wilkinson phase @xcite where the dynamical critical exponent @xmath1 and the kardar - parisi - zhang phase @xcite where @xmath2 .",
    "if in a model one has an edwards - wilkinson phase by introducing an asymmetry one can get a kardar - parisi - zhang phase . by introducing `` friction '' ( some processes oppose growth ) one gets a gapped phase ( see the flip - flop model described below ) .",
    "the interplay of asymmetry and `` friction '' is nicely displayed in @xcite .",
    "as far as we know the first example of a nonlocal growth model is the derrida and vannimenus study of the interface in weakly disordered systems @xcite .",
    "much later another model with nonlocal rates appeared in the literature , the raise and peel model ( rpm ) @xcite .",
    "this is a one - parameter ( denoted by @xmath3 ) dependent model which also displays three situations , analogously to local models . for small values of @xmath3 one",
    "has a gapped phase , for @xmath4 one has a gapless phase with @xmath5 ( not @xmath1 ) and for @xmath6 one has a gapless phase with varying values of @xmath0 ( this corresponds to the kpz phase in local models ) .",
    "dyck ( special rsos ) paths describe the interface .",
    "adsorption is local but desorption is nonlocal .",
    "the desorption processes look a bit artificial , they come from the algebraic background of the model at @xmath4 .",
    "what is special in this model is that for @xmath4 one can do analytic calculations and show that the model is conformal invariant .",
    "moreover , the stationary state of the model has fascination combinatorial properties @xcite .",
    "recently , another model ( the peak adjusted raise and peel model ( parpm ) ) was introduced @xcite .",
    "the adsorption and desorption process are like in the rpm but the rates depend on the number of peaks in the dyck paths .",
    "this makes the rates dependent on the size of the system .",
    "a new parameter @xmath7 was introduced such that if @xmath8 , one recovers the rpm at @xmath4 .",
    "it was shown that conformal invariance is maintained in whole domain of @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we present a new model , the raise and strip model ( rsm ) which is again a one - parameter dependent model , with local adsorption and nonlocal desorption processes , the rules for the latter being much simpler .",
    "the configuration space is the same as in the rpm .",
    "our aim was to see if the main ingredient to get conformal invariance is the existence of nonlocal processes of a special kind .",
    "we were aware that the price to pay is loosing integrability and that one had to use monte carlo simulations on large lattices to get results .",
    "we have indeed observed that the rsm has a phase diagram similar to the one seen in the rpm . at the conformal invariant point ,",
    "the critical exponents are different . since other models having the same structure as the rsm can easily be defined , it is plausible to assume that there is a whole class of models with conformal invariance which should be studied .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we defined the observables for models defined on dyck paths .",
    "these observables are used in the description of the properties of the models .",
    "the flip - flop , the raise and peel and raise and strip models are defined in section 3 .",
    "the flip - flop model is the local version of the rsm , it was studied in order to see the effect of nonlocality introduced in the rsm .",
    "the flip - flop model is presented in section 4 .",
    "one shows , using known results from combinatorics and monte carlo simulations that one has a critical point with a dynamic critical exponent @xmath1 which separates two gapped phases .",
    "the raise and peel model is shortly reviewed in section 5 .",
    "the main results of our research are given in section 6 in which we present not only the properties of the stationary states of the rsm but also the time dependent phenomena .",
    "an interesting new phenomenon occurs if the parameter @xmath3 is larger the @xmath9 .",
    "the system stays gapless with varying values of @xmath0 ( like in the rpm ) but unlike the rpm where in the stationary state , the average height increases logarithmically with the size of the system , in the rsm , the average height profile is a triangle with a height of the order of the system size .    for completeness , a variant of the flip - flop model in which the configuration space is changed , is presented in the appendix .",
