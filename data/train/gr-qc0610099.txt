    "as remnants of supernova explosions , neutron stars comprised of matters with subnuclear and supranuclear densities have long been a major subject of intense interest for researchers in astrophysics , nuclear physics and particle physics since the pioneering studies of oppenheimer and volkoff @xcite and tolman @xcite .",
    "their internal structure is likely to provide a direct test for theories of nuclear matter , quark matter and high energy physics ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . for example , through measurement of the eddington flux and the redshift in the x - ray burst , the mass and the radius of the neutron star exo 0748 - 676 were simultaneous determined , and relevant data were used to rule out soft equations of state ( eos ) for nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "likewise , a few astronomical observations revealing evidences for the existence of the strange quark star ( sqs ) , a variant of the neutron star ( see e.g. @xcite ) , to some extent resuscitate the theory of quark matter @xcite .    on the other hand , the huge gravitational field accompanying a dense neutron star also attracts the attention of relativists . in particular",
    ", undulating neutron stars are expected to be promising sources of gravitational waves .",
    "for instance , when gravitational - wave detectors of various designs are in full swing in one or two decades ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , the frequency of detection of gravitational waves emitted in the mergers of binary neutron stars could be as high as several hundreds per year @xcite . besides , gravitational waves emitted during asymmetric stellar core collapses leading to the formation of neutron stars could also be detectable @xcite .",
    "it is then likely that neutron stars could be surveyed in the gravitational wave channel .",
    "more importantly , gravitational waves can easily penetrate the core of a neutron star without being absorbed , and might carry useful information about the deep interior of the star . as the behavior of nuclear matter at high densities is not yet clearly known , the internal structure of neutron stars is masked and often gives rise to many debatable issues .",
    "hence , a lot of in - depth studies have been sparked off by the possibility of unveiling the internal structure of neutron stars from their gravitational - wave signals .",
    "detailed examination of such signals , which has been coined  gravitational - wave asteroseismology \" , were carried out by various groups of researchers ( see e.g. @xcite ) to study effects of different physical processes , including superfluidity , occurrence of quark matter , and phase transitions .",
    "gravitational waves emitted from a neutron star are commonly analyzed in terms of quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) characterized by complex eigenfrequencies @xmath1 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 measuring respectively the rates of pulsation and damping @xcite . to infer the physical parameters of a neutron star from its qnm frequencies , andersson and kokkotas made use of the universal behavior in the qnms of the fundamental fluid @xmath4-mode and the first polar @xmath0-mode to estimate the radius and the mass of the star @xcite .",
    "besides , the most probable eos among all the known models of stellar matters could also be identified from the frequency of the leading @xmath5-mode ( or axial @xmath0-mode ) oscillation @xcite .    in a series of recent papers @xcite ,",
    "we have studied the physical origin of the universality in the pulsation frequencies of the @xmath4-mode and @xmath0-mode stellar pulsations discovered in refs . @xcite and @xcite , and developed a scaled - coordinate logarithmic perturbative theory ( sclpt ) for neutron stars to locate axial @xmath0-mode oscillations .",
    "the main objective of the current paper is then to work out a feasible scheme to infer the internal structure of a neutron star from its gravitational wave spectrum . assuming that the frequencies and the damping rates of a few @xmath0-mode oscillations of a neutron star can be identified from gravitational - wave observation , we iteratively invert the sclpt scheme to determine the mass @xmath6 , the radius @xmath7 , the mass density @xmath8 at radius @xmath9 , and the mass distribution function @xmath10 ( i.e. the total mass inside radius @xmath9 ) of the star . in turn , accurate equation of state of nuclear matter",
    "can also be obtained numerically from the mass distribution function .",
    "while the idea underlying the inversion scheme reported here is completely generic , we will consider and use the spectrum of axial @xmath0-mode oscillations to illustrate our method . as a remark ,",
    "we note here that lindblom has proposed a scheme to determine , up to certain accuracy , eos of the nuclear matter of a neutron star from its mass and radius @xcite .",
    "however , the eos considered in lindblom s scheme is limited to barotropic type .",
    "in contrast , our method directly exploit the frequencies of several qnms to determine the radius , the mass and other useful parameters of the star .",
    "moreover , the eos obtained from our inversion scheme is free from constraints .",
    "we will show in the following discussion that even the exotic eos of quark matter can be inferred from the gravitational wave signals of a sqs .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , we review the universality existing in the qnm frequencies ( including the real and the imaginary parts ) of neutron stars described by different eos and discuss how such behavior can be explained by the tolman vii model ( tviim ) of stars @xcite . in sect .",
    "iii we approximate the mass distribution of a realistic neutron star by that of tviim plus some small correction terms to be determined from the inversion scheme .",
    "section iv outlines the spirit of the inversion scheme while explicit formulas for the scheme are derived in sect .",
    "v. in sect .",
    "vi we apply our method to invert the eoss of several realistic stars and numerical results are shown there .",
    "section  vii studies the feasibility of our method and then we conclude our paper in sect .",
    "the present paper is the expanded version of a recent letter @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise stated , geometric units are used in this paper .",
    "first of all , we review the universality in qnms of gravitational waves and state its physical origin , thus introducing the starting point of our inversion scheme  the tviim .",
    "it has recently been observed that the qnm frequencies of the leading @xmath0-mode and @xmath4-mode oscillations of non - rotating neutron stars approximately satisfy the following scaling law @xcite : @xmath11 here @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are complex constants determined from curve fitting . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , we plot @xmath15 and @xmath16 against the compactness @xmath17 for the leading axial @xmath0-mode of non - rotating neutron stars characterized by different eoss , including models a and c proposed by pandharipande @xcite , models au and ut proposed by wiringa , fiks and fabrocini @xcite , models apr1 and apr2 proposed by akmal , pandharipande and ravenhall @xcite .",
    "one can easily see that both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , in agreement with ( [ tl ] ) , well approximated by quadratic function of @xmath18 .",
    "the universality observed in the spectra of realistic neutron stars comes as a surprise because , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , the pressure @xmath19 at a given density @xmath20 varies greatly for the eoss considered there . to understand the physical origin underlying the universality",
    ", we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the scaled complex eigenfrequencies @xmath21 of axial @xmath0-mode , polar @xmath0-mode and @xmath4-mode oscillations , to a good approximation , depend only on the compactness @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , we also discovered that the tviim , which was first proposed by tolman in 1939 @xcite and has a mass distribution function given by : @xmath23,\\ ] ] can mimic the mass distribution of most neutron stars .",
    "as clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , where the normalized mass function @xmath24 is plotted against the scaled radius @xmath25 for stars with a compactness @xmath26 and described by different eos as mentioned above , the mass distribution function @xmath27 is able to approximate the mass distribution inside neutron stars with different eoss .",
    "moreover , the scaled frequency @xmath21 of qnms of tviim is close to those of realistic neutron stars ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) and display similar scaling behavior mentioned above .",
    "it is obvious that tviim does provide a good approximation to stars with varying eoss , and the universality shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] can be captured by the best quadratic fit to the qnms of tviim , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "a distinct feature of tviim is that the scaled complex eigenfrequencies @xmath21 of its qnms depend only on the compactness of the star @xcite .",
    "hence , the observed universality in the qnms ( @xmath0-mode and @xmath4-mode ) is expected to be closely related to tviim and was indeed verified using sclpt @xcite .",
    "the density distribution of tviim , given by @xmath31,\\ ] ] with the central density @xmath32 , is so simple that the metric coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 , defined by the line element @xmath35 : @xmath36 can be obtained analytically : @xmath37 here @xmath38 , and @xmath39,\\\\ \\phi_1&=&\\phi(\\xi^2=1)=\\arctan\\sqrt{\\frac{\\cal{c}}{3(1 - 2\\cal{c})}}\\,,\\\\ w_1&=&w(\\xi^2=1)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] besides , the pressure can also be found exactly from the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations @xcite : @xmath40,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by virtue of ( [ realisticdrho ] ) , we have : @xmath41 the eos of tviim is consequently given by : @xmath42,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 + \\arctan\\sqrt{\\frac{\\cal{c}}{3(1 - 2\\cal{c } ) } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\frac{1}{2}\\log\\left[\\frac{1}{6}-\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_0}+\\sqrt { \\frac{1}{3\\cc}-\\frac{1}{3 } \\left(1-\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_0}\\right)\\left(2+\\frac{3\\rho}{\\rho_0}\\right ) } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is obvious that both @xmath27 and the eos for tviim depend on @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( or any two independent parameters derivable from them ) .",
    "thus , once these two parameters are known , the mass distribution inside the star and the eos of the stellar matter are determined automatically . in the following discussion",
    ", we will make use of this salient feature of tviim as the foundation of the inversion scheme .",
    "based on the the universality and the tviim discussed above , a feasible scheme is proposed here to infer the internal structure of a neutron star from its gravitational wave spectra . as the first step of the scheme",
    ", we consider the frequency of the leading ( i.e. the least - damped ) axial @xmath0-mode for tviim , @xmath44 , and plot the ratio @xmath45 against with the compactness in fig .",
    "we see that @xmath46 is in fact a monotonically function of @xmath22 .",
    "hence , once @xmath47 is known , @xmath22 can be obtained from fig .",
    "[ f4 ] and in turn @xmath48 can be read from fig .",
    "it is then straightforward to find @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "likewise , @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be inferred from @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the frequencies of the second and the third leading modes , as @xmath51 and @xmath52 are also monotonic functions of the compactness @xmath18 ( see fig .  [ f4 ] ) .",
    "however , the frequency @xmath47 is preferred in the subsequent discussion because it has the most sensitive dependence on @xmath18 .",
    "as tviim provides a benchmark for other realistic stars , we expect that the eigenfrequency of the leading axial @xmath0-mode emitted from a realistic neuron star , @xmath53 , is close to that of a tviim star with the same mass @xmath6 and the same radius @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we could go through the procedure outlined in the last paragraph with @xmath47 replaced by @xmath54 to obtain an estimate of the mass and the radius of the star in consideration .",
    "this first step in our scheme is analogous to the method proposed by andersson and kokkotas @xcite .",
    "however , we will consider the frequencies of the non - leading modes and show that they can lead to much improved estimates of the mass , the radius and the eos as well .",
    "the mass distribution of a realistic neutron star is of course different from that of a tviim star .",
    "however , the difference is small . considering the asymptotic behavior of the density around @xmath55 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , we expand @xmath10 as : @xmath56",
    "where @xmath57 @xmath58 , and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) are @xmath61 adjustable parameters to provide the best fit to @xmath62 . as the mass @xmath6 and the radius @xmath7 of the neutron star are not yet exactly known , they are also considered as free parameters .",
    "there are consequently @xmath5 free parameters to be determined from the qnm frequencies .",
    "besides , as the zeroth order approximation to @xmath10 , @xmath63 is well approximated by @xmath27 , which will be chosen to be the initial guess for @xmath63 .",
    "generally speaking , we can approximate the configuration of a neutron star by choosing a set of @xmath59 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 which  best fit \" the exact one . before working out the optimization process that determines these @xmath5 parameters",
    ", we briefly mention the physical significance of @xmath64 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath65 for all @xmath66 .",
    "hence , @xmath67 does not affect the total mass of the neutron star while modifying the internal mass distribution .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that each @xmath67 has only one maximum value and the position of such maximum gets closer to the stellar surface as @xmath66 increases .",
    "this implies that @xmath67 with small @xmath66 has significant contribution to the core of the neutron star , while @xmath67 with large @xmath66 mainly affects the the mass distribution near the stellar surface .",
    "in addition , the central density of the neutron star depends only on @xmath63 and @xmath68 . as a consequence , as far as the high density regime of the eos is concerned , @xmath67 with smaller @xmath66 is likely to be more important .",
    "lastly , the density distribution can be easily derived from the mass distribution , @xmath69 where @xmath70,\\ ] ] @xmath71.\\ ] ]",
    "suppose that the mass and the radius of a star are known with certain accuracy from the the frequency of its leading mode , which are equal to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "the exact values of these quantities , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and the mass distribution inside the star can be determined from the frequencies of qnms of higher orders .",
    "( @xmath77 ) qnm frequencies of a neutron star are known and we are going to search for the optimal stellar model that yields the minimal deviation from the measured qnm frequencies . as discussed above ,",
    "there are @xmath5 independent small parameters in the model , namely @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 . if all of these free parameters equal zero , the frequencies are denoted by @xmath80 .    based on the first order result of sclpt @xcite , the corresponding first order change in the @xmath81-th ( @xmath82 ) qnm frequencies",
    "@xmath83 is @xmath84 which is close to the exact change : @xmath85 explicit expressions for @xmath86 will be derived in the following section of this paper using sclpt . by minimizing the square - deviation    @xmath87    where the overbar indicates the complex conjugate of a variable , one can obtain a set of @xmath88 and hence an optimal approximate model for the observed neutron star . the necessary condition for @xmath89 to achieve a minimum is obviously : @xmath90 for all @xmath91 , leading to @xmath76 linear equations : @xmath92 this system of equations can be rewritten in the following matrix representation : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a @xmath95 square matrix , @xmath96 is the column vector of @xmath97 , and @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "consequently , we can compute the best @xmath59 by solving the above matrix equation .      with the @xmath5 parameters @xmath100 obtained through the scheme sketched above",
    ", we can construct a new model star by incorporating these mass corrections into @xmath101 and compute a new set of qnm frequencies for such a mass distribution .",
    "again we can compare these qnm frequencies with the observed qnm frequencies @xmath83 , and minimize the error @xmath89 by solving ( [ matrix_a ] ) to yield a new set of @xmath100 . through this iterative scheme , one can generate convergent sequences for the mass , the radius and the mass distribution .",
    "the equilibrium configuration of a neutron star is given by the tov equations @xcite : @xmath102 here @xmath20 and @xmath19 are evaluated at a point @xmath103 .",
    "once @xmath10 is known , the density @xmath8 can be found from ( [ tov1 ] ) . combining ( [ tov2 ] ) and ( [ tov3 ] ) to yield a first - order differential equation for @xmath104 :",
    "@xmath105 one can obtain @xmath104 by solving ( [ tov2 + 3 ] ) with the boundary condition @xmath106 .",
    "hence , the eos can be straightforwardly inferred by comparing the two functions @xmath8 and @xmath104 .",
    "the starting point of the present inversion scheme is ( [ cqj ] ) , which expresses the first - order shift in qnm frequencies as a linear sum over various perturbations @xmath97 . to evaluate the coefficients @xmath107 in ( [ cqj ] )",
    ", we have to invoke the theory of first - order sclpt to find how various perturbations @xmath97 affect the qnm frequency @xcite .",
    "first of all , we introduce the following scaled variables : @xmath108 here the tortoise coordinate @xmath109 is related to the circumferential radius @xmath9 by @xmath110 and outside the star , the tortoise radial coordinate reduces to @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a constant that can be obtained by matching ( [ r*_in ] ) with ( [ r*_out ] ) at @xmath113 .",
    "besides , we also let @xmath114 and @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the tortoise radius of the star . in terms of these scaled variables , the neutron star regge - wheeler ( nsrw ) equation @xcite governing the evolution of axial @xmath0-mode pulsation",
    "can be rewritten as @xcite : @xmath117 \\tilde{\\psi}(\\tilde{r}_*)=0,\\ ] ] where for @xmath118 the scaled regge - wheeler potential takes the form : @xmath119,\\ ] ] and for @xmath120 , @xmath121.\\ ] ]    the scaled nsrw equation ( [ kg_sc ] ) is obviously more amenable to perturbative expansion since outside the star @xmath122 depends only on @xmath123 .",
    "hence , changes in the stellar mass do not directly affect the potential outside the star .",
    "therefore , perturbation arising from the change in the stellar mass , which also leads to variations in mass density , pressure , and stellar radius , becomes localized inside the star . in the subsequent discussion , we will show that shifts in qnm frequencies can be expressed in terms of integrals with finite domains of integration .",
    "consider an unperturbed neutron star which has a scaled circumferential ( tortoise ) radius @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) , a scaled potential @xmath126 , and a scaled known mass distribution function @xmath127 .",
    "note that all physical quantities are scaled with its own mass @xmath72 . the unperturbed star ( e.g. tviim )",
    "will be used to provide the zeroth - order approximation of a realistic star whose physical parameters are not exactly known and to be determined from the inversion scheme .",
    "analogous to other conventional perturbation theories , we will assume that the qnm wave function of the unperturbed star is known .",
    "if now the star is perturbed to a new configuration which is identical to that of the realistic star in consideration , the new potential function is given by : @xmath128 as a consequence , the circumferential ( tortoise ) radius of the perturbed star is also modified such that , @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "however , outside the star , @xmath131 , as a function of @xmath132 , remains unchanged .    consider the @xmath81-th qnm of the unperturbed star , which has a scaled frequency @xmath133 .",

    "( [ u_1 ] ) and ( [ freq3 ] ) it is then obvious that one has to evaluate the changes in the scaled potential , the scaled circumferential and tortoise radii of the star in order to find @xmath143 .",
    "the perturbed star is in fact the realistic star considered in the inversion scheme , whose scaled mass distribution @xmath144 and density distribution @xmath145 are expressed in terms of @xmath123 and its own exact compactness @xmath17 as follows : @xmath146 here    @xmath147.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to compare the perturbed and unperturbed stars , we rewrite @xmath144 and @xmath145 as : @xmath148 with @xmath149 @xmath150 and @xmath151 as mentioned previously . @xmath152 and @xmath153 are considered as the first order changes in the mass and density distributions . besides , it is straightforward to show that @xmath154 @xmath155 + \\int_0^{\\tr^{(0 ) } } \\left[\\frac{\\tlam^{(1)}(\\tr)-\\tnu^{(1)}(\\tr)}{2}\\right ] \\exp\\left[\\frac{\\tlam^{(0)}(\\tr)-\\tnu^{(0)}(\\tr)}{2}\\right ] d\\tr.\\ ] ]    these first - order quantities , including @xmath156 , are the inputs to sclpt .",

    "in figs .  [ f5 ] - [ f10 ] , we show numerical results obtained from the inversion scheme developed in the present paper for six different realistic neutron stars with a common compactness of @xmath188 . to gauge the accuracy of the scheme , we have used four different combinations of qnm frequencies : ( i ) @xmath54 ; ( ii ) @xmath54 and @xmath189 ; ( iii ) @xmath54 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 ; and ( iv ) @xmath54 and @xmath191 .",

    "that the computed radius might deviate from the exact one by a few percent in some cases , the result is in fact very accurate taking into account of the fact that the mass density near the surface of realistic neutron stars is usually very low .",

    "the radius of the star in consideration , which was also an unknown to be determined from the process , was divided into a fixed number of equal partitions .",
    "the values of the radius , density , and pressure at each of these small partitions were in turn obtained from the inversion scheme .",

    "[ f12 ] shows the result for an apr1 star with two approximately known qnm frequencies , @xmath54 and @xmath189 , and four parameters were used in the inversion .",
    "the random noise introduced was within @xmath199 of the exact value .",
    "the grey circles ( with error bars ) denote the average values of 12 simulations , which are fairly accurate .",
    "this strongly suggests that the inversion scheme proposed here is still feasible even if gravitational signals are blurred by experimental noises .",

    "the eos of quark matter is given by the mit bag model @xcite : @xmath201 where the value of the bag constant @xmath202 is @xmath203 .",
    "the crust of the sqs star , a thin layer of normal matter obeying the baym - pethick - sutherland eos @xcite , is supported by coulomb forces above the quark matter core @xcite .",
    "the eos for quark matter is rather exotic and the density profile of such a star is even discontinuous across the inner boundary of the crust .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f13 ] , the inversion scheme still works nicely as long as four qnms are used .",
    "it is then obvious that the current inversion scheme outperform the one proposed by lindblom , which is limited to barotropic type eos @xcite .",
    "in the above discussion we show how the internal structure of a neutron star can be systematically determined from several of its qnm frequencies .",
    "like all other studies in the area of gravitational - wave asteroseismology ( see e.g. @xcite ) , our method depends crucially on reliable data of gravitational wave signals , which have not yet been available .",
    "therefore , the realization of the present scheme hinges on the successful operation of various existing gravitational - wave detectors ( such as ligo , virgo , geo600 ) , and also the development in the design and construction of new gravitational - wave detectors in the future . in the following discussion",
    ", we consider the possibility of detecting qnms of neutron stars based on analysis outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the detection of a qnm signal , an exponentially decaying sinusoidal wave with frequency @xmath204 and decay time @xmath205 , depends on the distance @xmath9 between the emitter ( the neutron star ) and the observer ( the earth ) , the energy @xmath206 channelled in such a qnm , and of course the sensitivity of the gravitational - wave detector , which is measured in terms of its noise power spectral density @xmath207 ( see fig .  [ f14 ] ) .",
    "a strong signal is associated with a large signal - to - noise ratio given by @xcite : @xmath208 where the quality factor @xmath209 , and the amplitude of such a gravitational wave signal @xcite : @xmath210 the fractional statistical errors in the determination of the frequency and the decay time , respectively denoted by @xmath211 and @xmath212 , are estimated to be @xcite : @xmath213 @xmath214 with @xmath215    both ligo and virgo have a broad - band sensitivity in the hundred - hertz range where @xmath216 ( see fig .  [ f14 ] ) .",
    "it is then obvious that these first generation detectors could not accurately locate @xmath0-mode qnms of neutron stars in our galaxy , which are characterized by the following typical values : @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is generally believed that the sensitivities of the first generation detectors are not sufficient to carry out quantitative measurements .",
    "ligo - ii , a second generation gravitational - wave detector , is aimed at operation in the hundred - hertz range near the standard quantum limit ( sql ) and has a lower noise level given approximately by @xcite : @xmath221,\\ ] ] with @xmath222 . in spite of the improved sensitivity , as shown in table  [ t2 ] , where @xmath223 and @xmath224 are assumed , ligo - ii is not yet sensitive enough to locate @xmath0-mode qnms of neutron stars in our own galaxy . on the other hand ,",
    "it is worthwhile to note that sql can in fact be overcome by utilizing quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) devices @xcite .",
    "the design of ligo - iii , a third generation gravitational - wave detector , is currently under intense discussion .",
    "various strategies that can beat the gravitational - wave sql by an arbitrarily large amount , over an arbitrarily wide range of frequencies have been proposed and analyzed @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider specifically another third generation gravitational - wave detector , euro ( european gravitational wave observatory ) , proposed by a group of european scientists in 2000 , aims to make quantitative surveys of gravitational - wave signals over 4 decades of frequency , namely from 1 hz to tens of khz @xcite . as stated in the proposal @xcite , _",
    " euro can do asteroseismology on neutron stars by resolving the frequencies of the dominant normal modes of vibration\"_. in the proposal two possible configurations of euro were discussed . in the first configuration ,",
    "euro , the sensitivity in the high frequency range is still limited by the photon shot noises , with a noise level given by @xcite : @xmath225,\\ ] ] where the knee - frequency @xmath226 .",

    "[ f14 ] , the noise level of this configuration in the khz range is two orders less than that of ligo - ii . with this detector",
    "@xmath0-mode gravitational wave signals emitted from neutron stars within our galaxy can be detected with error bound of a few percent .",
    "therefore , the inversion scheme outlined above will become viable once euro operates as proposed",
    ".    in the second configuration , referred to as euro ( xylophone ) in the present paper , the shot noise limit in the high - frequency regime is beaten by parallel operation of several narrow - banded cryogenic interferometers comprising a  gravitational - wave xylophone \" @xcite .",
    "the noise level of such a device is approximately given by @xcite : @xmath227,\\ ] ] which can be obtained by removing the last term ( i.e. the shot - noise term ) in ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ f14 ] , table  [ t2 ] , and also the following scaling relations @xcite : @xmath228 the advent of the detector euro ( xylophone ) will enable observation of gravitational waves from extra - galactic neutron stars and black holes . we therefore expect that the inversion scheme developed in the present paper can reveal fruitful information about the internal structure of neutron stars from the data gathered by these third generation gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "despite the mass of some neutron star binaries can be inferred from their orbital periods , as yet there is no generic method to determine their radii except for a few cases where data of gravitational red - shift are available @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we have proposed a robust inversion scheme to determine the mass , the radius , the mass distribution and the eos of a neutron star from its gravitational wave spectra , which could be obtained by the matched filtering method ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we expect that our scheme could operate in conjunction with gravitational - wave detectors available in one or two decades , e.g. ligo - iii , euro and euro ( xylophone ) , to probe the interior of neutron stars . as clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , an inversion scheme using two leading qnm frequencies can readily discriminate between any two smooth eoss considered there .",
    "the method developed in the present paper in fact makes the construction of such gravitational - wave detectors more rewarding .    in reality ,",
    "gravitational signals are inevitably contaminated by noises of various kinds , including thermal , quantum and gravity - gradient noises ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "analogous to other fields of astronomy , observational errors introduced by noises are deemed the major hurdle to the implementation of the inversion scheme proposed here . in order to infer the fine internal structure of neutron stars ,",
    "theoretical and experimental efforts must be done to minimize the noise level , and sophisticated data acquisition skills have to be developed to distinguish signals from noises @xcite . on the other hand , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f12 ] , our method remains accurate and stable against contamination of data created by noises .",
    "the construction and operation of advanced gravitational - wave detectors that can provide higher detection sensitivities and resolution power will strongly boost the progress in gravitational - wave asteroseismology @xcite .",
