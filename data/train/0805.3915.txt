    "of the almost @xmath11 extrasolar planets discovered to date , the @xmath12 transiting planets are the only ones allowing a measurement of their mass and radius and the study of their atmospheres ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . of those ,",
    "gj  436b serves as a unique opportunity to study a planet with mass and radius as small as neptune .",
    "although several planets have already been detected with minimum masses similar to the mass of gj  436b , for example gj  581b , c @xmath13 d , @xcite , hd  4308b @xcite and cnc  55e @xcite , gj  436b is the only _ transiting _ neptune - mass planet discovered so far .",
    "moreover , it is the only known transiting planet orbiting an m - type star , presenting an opportunity to help constrain stellar models in this mass range .",
    "gj  436b was initially discovered by @xcite through a radial velocity ( rv ) modulation of its host star . @xcite",
    "have refined its orbital elements , specifically the eccentricity , @xmath14 , and identified a linear velocity trend of @xmath15  m  s@xmath10  yr@xmath10 .",
    "those authors suggested that the velocity trend might result from the presence of a long - period second planet in the system , a planet that could induce a periodic modulation of the orbital eccentricity of gj  436b .",
    "this type of effect was suggested already for triple stellar systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , and for a planet in a binary system for 16  cygni  b @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that this interpretation of the eccentricity looks especially attractive if the circularization timescale of gj  436b is shorter than the age of the system , because then we need to explain why the orbit of the planet has not been circularized .",
    "@xcite obtained photometric observations of gj  436 at the expected time of possible transits and concluded that a transit was unlikely .",
    "nevertheless , the transiting nature of gj  436b was recently discovered by @xcite who measured a planetary radius of @xmath16 and mass of @xmath17 .",
    "soon after the discovery , a transit and secondary eclipse events were observed by _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ at 8  @xmath18 m @xcite , further constraining the system parameters and reducing the uncertainties by a factor of about @xmath19 for the planet to star radius ratio and mid - transit timing .",
    "those observations resulted in a somewhat increased planetary radius , of @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite was able to refine further the planet parameters by deriving more accurate constraints on the host star and obtained a slightly larger planetary mass , @xmath21 , and a more precise planetary radius , of @xmath22 .",
    "recently , @xcite restudied the system and suggested that the observed radial velocities of the system are consistent with an additional small , super - earth planet in a close orbit around gj  436 in a 1:2 mean - motion resonance with the known planet . similarly to @xcite , they suggested that this planet could pump eccentricity into the orbit .",
    "@xcite further suggested that such an additional planet can induce a precession of the orbital plane of gj  436b , if the orbital planes of motion of the two planets are inclined relative to each other .",
    "such a precession should change the inclination relative to our line of sight and therefore might explain why @xcite failed to observe a transit in 2004 .    immediately after the detection of the transits of gj  436b by @xcite we launched a ground - based ( gb ) observational campaign to obtain high - quality transit light curves in different filters .",
    "our motivation was to obtain the first group of light curves which will be used by future studies to look for a possible variation of the impact parameter and to search for transit timing variations ( ttv ; @xcite ) .",
    "our observations are described in   [ observations ] . in our analysis ,",
    "  [ analysis ] , we simultaneously analyze six complete gb transit light curves : five light curves obtained in our campaign and the light curve from @xcite . in   [ discussion ] we discuss our results .",
    "in addition to the transit of ut  2007  may  2 , which was reported by @xcite and was the first complete transit observation of gj  436b , we obtained five complete transit light curves of four different transit events .",
    "the following paragraphs briefly describe these observations .",
    "we observed the transits of ut  2007  may  4 and may  25 with the wise observatory 1  m telescope , located in israel .",
    "we used a princeton instruments ( pi ) versarray camera and a @xmath23 pixels back - illuminated ccd , with a pixel scale of @xmath24 per pixel , giving a field of view of @xmath25 . on may 4 we used a johnson @xmath26 filter and on may 25 a bessel @xmath27 filter",
    "the flexible scheduling of the wise 1  m telescope was an important factor in obtaining the transit light curve of may  4 , less than three days after the first observation of a complete transit .",
    "the transit of ut  2007  may  4 was simultaneously observed with the wise observatory 0.46  m telescope , operated remotely .",
    "the camera was a @xmath28 pixels santa barbara instrument group ( sbig ) st-10 xme ccd detector with a field of view of @xmath29 and a scale of @xmath30 per pixel .",
    "this camera has no filters . for a detailed description of this telescope and instrument",
    "see @xcite .    on ut  2007",
    "may  23 and may  31 we used the 1.2  m telescope at the fred l. whipple observatory ( flwo ) on mount hopkins , arizona .",
    "the camera was the keplercam , which is a @xmath31 fairchild 486 ccd with a square field of view @xmath32 on a side @xcite . on both nights the filter was sloan @xmath33 and a @xmath34 binning was used , giving a pixel scale of @xmath35 per binned pixel .",
    "basic data reduction procedures , including bias and flat - field correction , were applied to all images using standard iraf routines .",
    "we then performed aperture photometry of gj 436 and several comparison stars of similar brightness showing no significant variability .",
    "the light curve of gj 436 was calibrated by dividing it by the summed flux of the comparison stars .",
    "next , we fitted a polynomial of degree one or two to the out - of - transit ( oot ) points vs.  time , and divided all points by this polynomial .",
    "the amplitude of these polynomial corrections in mmag per transit duration was in the range of 0.11.0 mmag .",
    "as a final step , we divided the entire light curve by the oot median intensity and normalized the measurement uncertainties so the median uncertainty oot will equal the oot rms . table  [ lclist ] lists all photometric measurements of the @xmath0 light curves obtained in this campaign .",
    "table  [ lctable ] lists for each light curve the ut start date and time , observatory and telescope , the filter used , limb darkening coefficients used in its analysis , average exposure time , average cadence ( in min@xmath10 ) , duration of the entire observation , start and end airmass , the @xmath36 factor ( see below ) , rms residuals , and the photometric noise rate ( pnr ) .",
    "the pnr is a quantity which takes into account the rms and the cadence , defined as rms@xmath37 , in units of mmag per minute ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we decided not to include the publicly available _",
    "spitzer  _ 8  @xmath18 m light curve in our simultaneous fitting since the shape of that light curve is dependent on how the _ spitzer  _ `` ramp '' was modeled @xcite .",
    "as the _ spitzer  _ measurements are much more precise than the gb measurements , this ramp could have systematically influenced our results .",
    "for comparison , the _ spitzer  _ light curve pnr is a factor of @xmath38 smaller than that of our ground - based light curves .",
    "accounting for correlated noise @xcite was done similarly to the `` time - averaging '' method of @xcite . after a preliminary analysis we binned the residual light curves using bin sizes close to the duration of ingress and egress .",
    "the presence of correlated noise in the data was quantified as the ratio between the binned residual light curves standard deviation and the expected standard deviation in the absence of correlated noise . for each light curve",
    "we estimated @xmath36 as the largest ratio among the bin sizes we used .",
    "we then multiplied the relative flux errors by @xmath36 .",
    "values of @xmath36 are in the range of @xmath39@xmath40 and are listed in table  [ lctable ] .      we fitted the system parameters to all six gb light curves simultaneously .",
    "our transit light curve model consisted of nine parameters : the orbital period , @xmath41 ; a particular mid - transit time , @xmath4 ; planet to star radius ratio , @xmath42 ; semimajor axis scaled by the stellar radius , @xmath43 ; impact parameter , @xmath44 ( see eq .",
    "@xmath45 of @xcite for the formula of the impact parameter in an eccentric orbit ) ; two limb - darkening coefficients @xmath46 and @xmath47 , for a quadratic limb - darkening law ; orbital eccentricity , @xmath48 ; and longitude of periastron , @xmath49 .",
    "the latter four parameters were held fixed in the fitting process , hence our model had @xmath0 free parameters .    for transiting planets on eccentric orbits the mid point , in time , between transit start and end is different than the time of sky - projected star - planet closest approach . for gj  436b",
    "this difference is comparable to the typical uncertainty on the mid - transit times obtained here . in our model",
    "the mid - transit time is defined as the time of closest approach , which is also the time of minimum light .    for @xmath48 and @xmath49 we used the values given by @xcite .",
    "although other authors ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) report more precise values for @xmath48 , their uncertainty on @xmath49 is either much higher than that of @xcite or not reported .",
    "as the errors in two orbital parameters are correlated , we chose to adopt the reference giving the smallest uncertainty on both . to determine @xmath46 and @xmath47 we adopted a model of @xmath50  k @xcite , @xmath51 @xcite and [ fe / h]=-0.03 @xcite and interpolated on the @xcite grids . for the light curve obtained with the wise observatory 0.46  m telescope , which has no filter , we used limb - darkening coefficients corresponding to the @xmath27 filter , as its ccd response resembles a `` wide-@xmath27 '' filter @xcite .",
    "the coefficients used for each light curve are listed in table  [ lctable ] .",
    "we used the formulas of @xcite to determine the relative flux as a function of the planet - star sky - projected separation and the monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) algorithm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to determine the parameters that best fit the data , along with their uncertainties .",
    "mcmc algorithms have already been used extensively in the literature for fitting transit light curves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming a uniform prior for the five fitted parameters , the algorithm can be viewed as a random walk in the five - dimensional parameter space of the model .",
    "starting from an initial guess , at each step the algorithm examines a new point in the parameter space which is reached by adding a gaussian random value to each of the parameters .",
    "the algorithm decides whether to accept the new point in the parameter space and move there , or repeat the current point in the chain depending on the resulting posterior probability . if the new point has a higher relative posterior probability the algorithm will move there , and if not , it will move to the new point with a relative probability of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the @xmath54 difference between the two points in parameter space .",
    "the distribution of parameter values in all points is used to derive the best fit value and its uncertainties .",
    "here we took the distribution median to be the best fit value and the values at the 84.13 and 15.87 percentiles to be the @xmath55 and @xmath56 confidence uncertainties , respectively .",
    "the widths of the gaussian distributions used to find a new point are a crucial part of the mcmc algorithm and they affect the fraction of accepted points , @xmath57 . in order to have @xmath57 close to @xmath58 @xcite we divided each long chain , of @xmath59 steps , into smaller chains ( mini - chains ) , of @xmath60 steps , and re - evaluated the distribution widths after the execution of each mini - chain .",
    "this re - evaluation was done by scaling them according to the relative difference between @xmath57 of the previous mini - chain , and the target value of @xmath58 .",
    "the same scaling was applied to all parameters .    to estimate the _ relative",
    "_ size of the distribution widths for each one of the model parameters we initially performed a sequence of @xmath19 mini - chains , where only that parameter was allowed to vary and the target @xmath57 was @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "thus , a single mcmc run was comprised of several sequences of @xmath19 mini - chains and a long chain , of @xmath62 mini - chains .",
    "for determining the final result we considered only the long chain while ignoring the first @xmath63 of its steps .",
    "we performed @xmath19 mcmc runs as described above while changing each time the initial guess and initial distribution widths .",
    "results of those runs were highly consistent with each other and our final result is based on all runs .    before describing our results we briefly",
    "describe how we tested our analysis :    * to test the adaptive form of our mcmc algorithm we re - ran it while fixing the distribution widths during the long chain part .",
    "the differences in the results for the fitted parameters did not exceed @xmath64 , and the differences in the estimated uncertainties were no more than @xmath65 .",
    "* we repeated our analysis while skipping the polynomial corrections mentioned in section  [ observations ] .",
    "the results for the fitted parameters were less than @xmath66 from the original ones , and the estimated uncertainties were similar at the @xmath63 level .",
    "* we applied our analysis on the _",
    "spitzer  _ 8  @xmath18 m light curve alone , and derived results similar to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , at the @xmath67 level . * to further test the validity of our results we re - ran mcmc while adopting a gaussian prior probability for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the central values and standard deviations were those given by @xcite .",
    "the results were not modified significantly .",
    "[ lc ] presents the six gb light curves , with our fitted model overplotted in solid lines .",
    "the three light curves obtained in the beginning of 2007  may are of better quality , especially the euler 1.2  m @xmath26 and wise 1  m @xmath26 light curves , with rms residuals of @xmath68 and @xmath69 mmag , respectively .",
    "the increased scatter in the three light curves obtained at the end of 2007  may is the result of the high airmass of these observations , done close to the end of the observational season .    our estimates for the fitted parameters , while fitting all six light curves simultaneously , are listed in table  [ fitparams ] . for comparison ,",
    "this table includes results from previous studies whenever these parameters were fitted directly . in case",
    "they were not , but can be calculated from other fitted parameters , they are given without an error .",
    "@xcite based their parameter determinations on an analysis of the euler 1.2  m @xmath26 light curve from ut  2007  may  2 , which is included in this work .",
    "the other three studies referred to in table  [ fitparams ] @xcite are based on the _ spitzer  _ 8  @xmath18 m light curve .",
    "results obtained by @xcite are not presented since for the light curve parameters of gj  436b these authors gave the weighted average of previous works .",
    "table  [ physparams ] lists our results for the physical parameters of the system , along with the corresponding values obtained previously .",
    "assuming the mass of the star to be @xmath70 @xcite and adopting the orbital parameters of @xcite ( specifically : @xmath71 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) we derived the planet mass and semi - major axis . using newton s version for kepler s third law we derive the star and planet radius .",
    "as mentioned in   [ introduction ] , @xcite suggested the presence of a second planet orbiting gj  436 , in an outer orbit close to a 2:1 mean - motion resonance with the transiting planet .",
    "the gravitational interaction between the two planets may cause a detected ttv signal @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the second planet is responsible for changing the inclination angle , @xmath72 , of the transiting planet orbit .",
    "the presence of such a planet may be detected through measuring transit timing and the impact parameter of many transit light curves .",
    "as the light curves obtained here are the first group of such light curves we performed two additional mcmc analyses , described below .",
    "first , we fitted @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 to all light curves and an independent @xmath4 to each transit light curve , in order to estimate the mid - transit time of each event . in this analysis",
    "the period does _ not _ determine the time intervals between transit events .",
    "it is used only for determining the true anomaly of each measurement within each light curve so it is only weakly constrained .",
    "hence , in this analysis @xmath41 was fixed at the value derived in our original analysis .",
    "the resulting six @xmath4 values were later used to derive the transit ephemeris by a linear fit .",
    "the new period is @xmath73 from the period fitted in our original mcmc run . repeating the process described in this paragraph with the new period results in a variation of only @xmath74 ,",
    "so no further iterations were done .",
    "table  [ tcb ] contains the mid - transit timings fitted independently to each light curve .",
    "note that light curves with the smallest rms residuals do not necessarily have the smallest mid - transit time uncertainty .",
    "for example , the flwo 1.2 m light curve , at @xmath75 , has relatively high rms residuals although a small mid - transit time uncertainty .",
    "this is simply the effect of the short keplercam cadence , as the increased number of points act to better constrain the mid - transit time .",
    "this effect is quantified by the pnr ( see table  [ lctable ] ) .    by fitting a linear function , @xmath76 to the transit epoch ,",
    "@xmath77 , we derived @xmath3 days and @xmath78 [ hjd ] . the transit event with @xmath79",
    "was chosen to be right in the middle of our observed events , although we did not observe that particular event .",
    "we take this ephemeris as our final result , listed in table  [ fitparams ] , and note that it is consistent with @xmath41 and @xmath4 derived from our original mcmc fitting .    the residuals from the linear fit",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ oc ] , known as the o - c diagram .",
    "the figure shows some indication for a variability of the period , reflected by the high @xmath54 value of the fit , of @xmath80 for @xmath81 degrees of freedom .",
    "however , the small number of points does not allow to assign any significance to the detection of this variability , especially because some systematic effects could shift some of the points .",
    "second , we performed a mcmc analysis where we looked for a transit impact parameter variation .",
    "the four parameters @xmath41 , @xmath4 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 were fitted to the entire data while the impact parameter , @xmath44 , was fitted independently to each light curve .",
    "the derived impact parameters are listed in table  [ tcb ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ b ] . as a reference ,",
    "we over - plotted in fig .",
    "[ b ] the value of our original run , in a solid line , and the upper and lower @xmath82 confidence limits in dashed lines .",
    "no significant variation can be seen in the data , although a long - term trend of the order of 0.2 year@xmath10 can not be ruled out .",
    "the two separate analyses described in this section were repeated without applying the polynomial corrections mentioned in section  [ observations ] .",
    "the results were consistent with the original ones .",
    "in addition , for both the o - c transit timing residuals and the impact parameters derived here we looked for a possible correlation with several external parameters , including mid - transit airmass , filter central wavelength and the light curves polynomial correction amplitude .",
    "all correlations were below the 1.5@xmath83 confidence level .",
    "this paper presents an analysis of @xmath1 complete transit light curves of gj  436b , spanning @xmath2 days , or @xmath84 orbital periods .",
    "our period is consistent with the period given by @xcite , of @xmath85 days , and is more precise .",
    "our value for @xmath42 ( see table  [ fitparams ] ) , is larger , by 1 - 2 @xmath83 , than the radii ratio derived for the _",
    "spitzer  _ 8  @xmath18 m light curve by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if this difference is real it may be induced by stellar spots , or wavelength dependent opacities in the planetary atmosphere ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , a similar effect , i.e. , an increased radius ratio in the optical relative to the ir , was already observed for hd  189733b @xcite .",
    "we examined the individual transit timing of each light curve ( ttv , see fig .  [ oc ] ) and derived the impact parameter of each light curve independently ( see fig .",
    "the transit timing residuals show a possible hint for variability , supported by the high @xmath54 of the fit . however , many more light curves are needed to establish the variability and to explore its nature .",
    "the impact parameter plot shows a possible trend , although a linear fit to the six data points gives a slope consistent with zero .",
    "comparing our derived transit ephemeris to transit times published recently ( @xcite , @xcite ) shows that the predicted transit times are somewhat earlier than the measured times .",
    "the difference is at the 12@xmath83 level , so it is not highly significant .",
    "however , if real , it supports the claim made by @xcite for a long - term drift in the transit times . together with the long - term slope in gj  436 rvs @xcite it suggests the existence of another object in the system , with a long period .",
    "future photometric and spectroscopic data will be able to better study this possibility .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the impact parameter of gj  436b can be changed by a precession of the line of nodes , induced by a second planet whose orbital plane is inclined relative to the orbit of gj  436b ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such an effect was already suggested by @xcite and @xcite for stellar triple systems .",
    "the precession period is @xmath86 @xcite , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the mass and period of the second planet , respectively . for the planet suggested by @xcite ,",
    "this precession is of the order of @xmath19 years .    for eccentric orbits the impact parameter",
    "can also be modified by the precession of the periastron , because the impact parameter depends on the orientation of the line of apsides ( see eq .",
    "@xmath45 of @xcite ) .",
    "the apsidal motion can be driven by the stellar quadrupole moment , or by a second planet .",
    "the precession driven by the stellar quadrupole moment could be quite slow , and therefore probably does not contribute to the variation of the impact parameter .",
    "the rate of the apsidal precession induced by another planet is of the same order of magnitude as the rate of the nodal precession , estimated in eq .",
    "[ unode ] , and therefore can be of the order of years , depending on the parameters of the unseen additional planet in the system .    in order to estimate the possible implication of the apsidal precession on the impact parameter we plot in fig .",
    "[ bw ] the impact parameter of gj  436b as a function of the argument of the periastron @xmath49 , at fixed orbital eccentricity and inclination .",
    "we can see that @xmath44 is modulated between @xmath89 and @xmath90 over the apsidal precession period .",
    "the upper dashed line of the figure indicates that at some phase of the precession period the transit of gj  436b will even lose its flat - bottom shape .",
    "the figure suggests that if the apsidal motion is of the order of ten years , we should be able to observe soon a change of the impact parameter . in case",
    "this modulation is due to apsidal motion , we will then be able to confirm the change of the line of apsides direction by timing the secondary eclipse or by precise rv measurements .",
