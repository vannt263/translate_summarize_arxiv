    "( [ ende ] ) is based on the assumption that the field effects can be accounted for by a quasi - chemical potential in the electronic part of the density matrix . for @xmath129 , it is known that this supposition leads to the einstein relation between the mobility and the diffusion coefficient .",
    "recently , this hypothesis has also been accepted for systems with spin - orbit interaction @xcite , although its application becomes more subtle due to the spin splitting of the energy bands .",
    "an analogous use of quasi - chemical potentials for the treatment of field effects on the spin density requires further justification .",
    "the appearance of the logarithmic dependence of the ac spin - hall conductivity in the disordered two - dimensional rashba model remind us very much of the logarithmic quantum corrections in the theory of weak localization @xcite .",

    "( [ log ] ) is comparable to this dependence observed in the completely other field of weak localization .",
    "based on the kinetic equations for the spin - density matrix of the two - dimensional rashba model , we treated the electric - field - induced spin accumulation and spin transport in the linear response regime . at zero temperature , the frequency dependence of both the spin accumulation and the longitudinal charge - carrier transport exhibit a sharp resonance at @xmath113 ( @xmath131 , with @xmath0 being the spin - orbit coupling constant ) , which is due to eigenmodes of spin excitations .",

    "similar resonances are expected to appear also in the @xmath132-cubed rashba model for 2d holes and the luttinger model for 3d holes .    for the charge - carrier transport , there are two completely equivalent procedures to calculate the conductance .",
    "the same results are obtained by starting either from the symmetrized product of the density and velocity operators or the time derivative of the dipole moment .",
    "unfortunately , this equivalence no longer holds for the spin transport .",
    "the spin is not a conserved quantity .",
    "therefore , it is a serious problem to chose a proper definition for the spin current that does not lose its physical foundation .",
    "most researchers preferred a definition of the spin - hall conductivity , which revealed rather unconventional properties so that serious doubts arose on its experimental relevance .",
    "recently , a physically motivated definition of the spin current has been suggested @xcite that resolved a number of difficulties of former approaches .",
    "it has been argued that the proper effective spin current is inevitably defined as the time derivative of the spin displacement . applying this definition , results for the spin - hall conductivity",

    "its physical origin is due to the initial time evolution of the spin polarization .",
    "furthermore , for a clean two - dimensional rashba model , we obtain a spin - hall conductivity that exhibits a logarithmic dependence at low - frequencies and not an universal constant value .",
