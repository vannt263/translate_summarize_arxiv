    "back in 1974 s. w. hawking  @xcite showed that black holes are not completely `` black '' objects , but rather emit thermal radiation at a temperature inversely proportional to their mass .",
    "this amazing prediction , crucial to establish the connection between black holes and thermodynamics  @xcite , represents a genuine quantum effect in a gravitational context and is widely considered as a milestone of modern theoretical physics . despite its conceptual importance , the weak intensity of hawking radiation has so far prevented any direct experimental observation .",

    ", many systems have been proposed as candidates for actual experimental detection of this class of effects  @xcite , e.g. superfluid liquid helium  @xcite , atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite , degenerate fermi gases  @xcite , slow light in moving media  @xcite , travelling refractive index interfaces in nonlinear optical media  @xcite , surface waves in water tanks  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we shall focus our attention on the specific case of bogoliubov phonons propagating on top of a moving atomic bose - einstein condensate .",
    "atomic becs are among the cleanest system where quantum physics can be investigated  @xcite : the temperature can in fact be made so low that the behavior of matter is dominated by the dual particle - wave nature of its constituents and the quantum dynamics is not masked by spurious thermal effects .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to other quantum coherent condensed - matter systems such as superfluid liquid helium , quantitative theories able to describe the collective dynamics from a microscopic standpoint are available .",
    "the possibility of creating in these systems black hole - like configurations that allow the study of the analog of hawking radiation has been discussed in the last years by several authors  @xcite . in a recent work  @xcite based on the gravitational analogy , we predicted that in this case a very characteristic pattern appears in the correlation function for the density fluctuations of a condensate as a consequence of the hawking effect .",
    "as demonstrated by a number of recent experiments  @xcite , the measurement of density correlations appears as a powerful tool to extract information on the microscopic physics of atomic gases .",
    "since the hawking effect consists of pairs of correlated phonons being emitted in opposite directions from the horizon , the quantum correlations within a pair propagate across the condensate and result into long - range density correlations between distant points on opposite sides of the horizon .",
    "the present paper reports numerical simulations that nicely confirm our predictions of ref.@xcite and further support the promise of experimental detection of the hawking radiation from the density correlations rather than from the phonon flux .",
    "we also point out qualitative features that can be used to univocally distinguish the hawking signal from fluctuations of different nature . differently from most previous works on analog models ,",
    "the present calculations are based on the application of microscopic many - body techniques to an experimentally realistic system .",

    "its attribution to partial reflection of thermal phonons is confirmed by the value of its slope , which is in very good agreement with the analytical prediction @xmath121 indicated as a dashed black line in fig.[fig : finitet](a , b ) .",
    "as the slope of the thermal tongue is completely different from the one @xmath97 of the hawking tongue , the hawking signal can be easily isolated in a correlation image from spurious thermal and atom loss  @xcite effects also at temperatures higher than @xmath122 .",
    "this is even more remarkable as in this regime it appears difficult to separate the hawking phonons from the thermal ones by looking just at the total phonon flux .    as a final check",
    "we have performed a numerical calculation for the case of a flow which remains everywhere sub - sonic .",

    "we conclude with a brief discussion of the main issues that may arise in an actual experiment that aims to observe the hawking radiation from the density correlations",
    ".    as the magnitude of the hawking signal is quite low , of the order of @xmath123 , a critical point in an actual experiment will be the signal to noise ratio in extracting the correlation signal due to the hawking effect from experimental noise .",
    "while many sources of noise can be avoided by carefully engineering the experimental set - up , shot noise is an intrinsic consequence of the discrete ( i.e. quantum ) nature of atoms and therefore can not be eliminated .",
    "a precise measurement then requires a large statistics to be collected , either by repeating the experiment many times or by creating a large number of ( almost ) identical bec samples on which to simultaneously perform the measurement .",
    "most probably , both these strategies will face the difficulty of keeping the parameters of the experimental set - up constant in space and/or time .",
    "another possibility is to use a continuous - wave atom laser beam propagating along an atomic fiber  @xcite and then perform a time average of the correlation signal over long times .",
    "several different outcoupling mechanism have been demonstrated , which allows for a wide tuning of both the density and the flow speed of the atom laser beam .",
    "furthermore , active stabilization techniques  @xcite can be used to keep the parameters of the output beam stable in time during the experiment .    in this perspective",
    ", the key experimental problem that remains so far unsolved is the one of continuously reloading the mother bec while emitting the atom laser beam .",
    "existing devices  @xcite are in fact limited by the finite number of atoms present in the mother bec , presently of the order of @xmath124 , but attempts to continuously reload the condensate during the atom laser operation have been recently reported  @xcite .",
    "as the hawking signal is inversely proportional to the diluteness parameter @xmath111 , a relatively strongly interacting system may be favourable to maximize the signal to noise ratio . as our predictions are basically a consequence of quantum hydrodynamics",
    ", we expect that their validity extends well beyond the case of weakly interacting becs that has been considered by our microscopic model .",
    "although no complete theory is available for a strongly interacting gas , the theory of luttinger liquids  @xcite appears to indicate that larger correlation signals can be observed in stronger interacting systems where the diluteness parameter is smaller .",
    "another crucial issue is to use an atomic detection scheme able to efficiently measure the density correlations from which to extract the hawking signal : several techniques have been developed during the last years to experimentally characterize local density fluctuations in ultracold atomic gases based on noise in absorption images  @xcite , on microchannel plate detectors  @xcite , or even on high - finesse optical cavities  @xcite .",
    "thanks to its non - destructive nature , this last technique to detect single atoms in an atom laser beam appears as a very promising one for the detection of hawking radiation from density correlations .",
    "in conclusion , we have provided clear numerical evidence of the presence of hawking radiation in a flowing atomic bose - einstein condensate in an acoustic black hole configuration .",
    "the signature of this effect was identified in the density - density correlation function for distant points located on opposite sides of the horizon .",
    "the intensity of the observed signal is in quantitative agreement with the predictions of the gravitational analogy in the hydrodynamic regime .",
    "a crucial novelty of this work consists in the fact that all numerical results have been obtained starting from a microscopic description of the system dynamics using standard methods of many - body theory , and the gravitational analogy has provided a physical insight to interpret the numerical observations . in this way",
    ", our numerical observations can be considered as an independent proof of the existence of hawking radiation and rule out some frequent concerns  @xcite on the role of short wavelength , `` trans - planckian '' physics on the hawking emission .",
    "we have shown that the stationary emission of phonons from the acoustic horizon persists even outside the hydrodynamical regime when the gravitational analogy can no longer be applied , and shares many of the typical properties of the hawking radiation .",
    "the characteristic pattern of the hawking signal in the density correlation function allows an easy identification from spurious effects of , e.g. , thermal origin even at temperatures significantly higher than the hawking temperature .",
