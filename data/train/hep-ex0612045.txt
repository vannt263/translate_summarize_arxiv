    "hadronic interactions of two photons lead to the production of hadrons whose properties in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) depend on the underlying partonic processes , as well as on the way in which the partons are transformed into observable hadrons .",
    "the study of inclusive hadron production is therefore an appropriate tool to investigate the validity of qcd in hadronic photon - photon interactions .",
    "furthermore a drastic discrepancy between data and nlo qcd has recently been observed in this process  @xcite which would indicate the breakdown of this otherwise so successful theory and hence requires further study .",
    "our measurements complement similar studies of jet production  @xcite .",
    "the same partonic processes are at work in qcd in both cases , but hadronisation is usually treated differently .",
    "to predict the production of single hadrons , universal fragmentation functions obtained from fits to independent data are utilised to describe the transition from partons to hadrons .",
    "jet observables on the other hand are designed to keep the influence of hadronisation processes small . the remaining distortion with respect to partonic jet observables",
    "is estimated using hadronisation models .",
    "the reliable calculation of an observable in perturbative qcd requires a sufficiently high energy scale which in our case is provided by the transverse momenta of the charged particles .",
    "first results have been published by opal at @xmath1 centre - of - mass energies @xmath92 and @xmath93  gev  @xcite .",
    "l3 has published results in the range @xmath94  gev  @xcite .",
    "this paper extends the opal measurements of the transverse momentum spectra and pseudorapidity axis points towards the centre of the lep ring , the @xmath95 axis points upwards and the @xmath96 axis points in the direction of the electron beam .",
    "the polar angle @xmath97 , the azimuthal angle @xmath98 and the radius @xmath99 denote the usual spherical coordinates .",
    "the pseudorapidity @xmath100 is defined as @xmath101 . ]",
    "distributions of charged hadrons in  @xcite using data taken at @xmath1 centre - of - mass energies from @xmath102 to @xmath3  gev , representing a roughly thirty - fold increase in integrated luminosity .",
    "the interactions of the photons can be modelled by assuming that each photon can either interact directly or appear resolved through its fluctuations into hadronic states . in leading order qcd",
    "this model leads to three different event classes for @xmath103 interactions : direct , single - resolved and double - resolved , where resolved means that the partons ( quarks or gluons ) inside the hadronic photon take part in the hard interaction .",
    "the probability to find partons in the photon is parametrised by parton density functions .    at lep the photons",
    "are radiated by the beam electrons and carry mostly small negative four - momenta squared , @xmath104 . in this paper events",
    "are considered only if the electrons are scattered at small angles and are not detected .",
    "both photons are therefore quasi - real ( @xmath105  gev@xmath106 ) .",
    "differential hadron production cross - sections are measured as a function of the transverse momentum and the pseudorapidity of charged hadrons .",
    "the inclusive cross - sections are compared to monte carlo ( mc ) event generators in leading order @xmath107 and theoretical calculations in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xmath107 for this process .",
    "a detailed description of the opal detector can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the central tracking was performed inside a solenoidal magnet which provided a uniform axial magnetic field of 0.435  t along the beam axis . starting with the innermost components , the tracking system consisted of a high precision silicon microvertex detector , a precision vertex drift chamber , a large volume jet chamber with 159 layers of axial anode wires and a set of @xmath96 chambers measuring the track coordinates along the beam direction .",
    "the transverse momenta , @xmath108 , of tracks are measured with a precision parametrised by @xmath109 ( @xmath108 in gev ) in the central region @xmath110 . in this paper transverse",
    "is always defined with respect to the beam axis .",
    "the magnet was surrounded in the barrel region ( @xmath111 ) by a lead glass electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) and a hadronic sampling calorimeter ( hcal ) , which in turn were surrounded by muon chambers .",
    "similar layers of detectors were installed in the endcaps ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the small angle region from 47 to 140  mrad around the beam pipe on both sides of the interaction point was covered by the forward calorimeters ( fd ) and the region from 33 to 59  mrad by the silicon tungsten luminometers ( sw ) .",
    "the latter were used to determine the luminosity by counting small - angle bhabha scattering events .",
    "the properties of the two interacting photons ( @xmath113 ) are described by their negative four - momentum transfers @xmath114 and their invariant mass .",
    "each @xmath115 is related to the electron scattering angle @xmath116 relative to the beam direction by @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the four - momenta of the beam electron and the scattered electron , respectively , and @xmath120 and @xmath121 are their energies",
    ". events with detected scattered electrons ( single - tagged or double - tagged events ) are excluded from the analysis .",
    "driven by the angular acceptance of the fd and sw calorimeters a value of @xmath122  gev@xmath106 is used in this analysis to separate the quasi - real photons of untagged events from the virtual photons of tagged events .",
    "the median @xmath104 resulting from this definition can not be determined from data since the scattered electrons are not tagged . for the kinematic range of this analysis",
    "the mc simulations predict the median @xmath104 to be of the order of @xmath123  gev@xmath106 .",
    "the hadronic invariant mass of the photon - photon system , @xmath124 , can be obtained from the energies and momenta @xmath125 of final state particles : @xmath126    the mc generators pythia 5.722  @xcite and phojet 1.10  @xcite have been used to simulate photon - photon interactions .",
    "pythia uses the sas-1d parametrisation  @xcite for the photon parton densities and phojet uses the grv parametrisation  @xcite .",
    "all relevant background processes were studied using mc generators .",
    "multihadronic events ( @xmath127 ) were simulated with pythia 6.125 .",
    "koralz 4.02  @xcite was used to generate the process @xmath128 and vermaseren  @xcite to generate @xmath129 .",
    "deep - inelastic e@xmath130 events were simulated with herwig 5.9  @xcite .",
    "all signal and background mc samples were generated with full simulation of the opal detector  @xcite .",
    "they are analysed using the same reconstruction algorithms as for the data .",
    "the production of charged hadrons was studied using data taken at @xmath1 centre - of - mass energies , @xmath131 , from 183 to 209  gev , amounting to a total integrated luminosity of 612.8  pb@xmath132 .",
    "the luminosity weighted average centre - of - mass energy is 195.8  gev .",
    "two - photon events are selected with the following set of cuts :    * at least six tracks must have been found in the tracking chambers . a track is required to have a minimum transverse momentum of 120 mev with respect to the @xmath96 axis and at least 40 hits in the central jet chamber .",
    "the number of measured hits in the jet chamber must be more than half of the number of possible hits given the track direction .",
    "the radial distance of nearest approach of the track to the primary vertex has to be less than 0.15  cm . *",
    "the visible invariant hadronic mass calculated from the position and the energy of the clusters measured in the ecal has to be greater than 3  gev . *",
    "the sum of all energy deposits in the ecal and the hcal has to be less than 50  gev to remove background from hadronic z decays in events with a radiative return to the z peak . * the missing transverse momentum of the event measured in the ecal and the fd has to be less than 8 gev . * to reject events with scattered electrons in the fd or sw , the total energy sum measured in the fd and sw has to be less than 60  gev . *",
    "the background due to beam - gas or beam - wall interactions is reduced by requiring the radial distance of the primary vertex from the beam axis to be less than 2  cm and the distance from the nominal vertex position along the @xmath96 direction to be less than 3  cm .",
    "after all cuts the data sample contains 1144035 events .",
    "the main remaining background processes are multihadronic z decays , @xmath133 and deep - inelastic e@xmath130 scattering .",
    "other background processes are found to be negligible .",
    "the multihadronic background is mainly reduced by the cut on the sum of the energy measured by the ecal and the hcal and by the cut on the missing transverse momentum .",
    "the @xmath133 processes are reduced by the cuts on the number of tracks and deep - inelastic e@xmath130 events are rejected by the cut on the energy in sw and fd .",
    "the trigger efficiency for events in this region of phase space is close to 100%  @xcite and no correction is applied .    from the mc simulations",
    "it is estimated that after all cuts the total remaining background is below 2% overall , but increasing to up to 50% at very high transverse momenta of the charged particles .",
    "the background is subtracted bin - by - bin from the distributions measured before corrections for detector resolution and acceptance are applied .",
    "the signal mc generators phojet and pythia are found to underestimate the cross - section . in particular they show a shape different from that in the data of the @xmath108-distribution of charged hadrons .",
    "to study a potential bias resulting from this deficiency the mc events have been reweighted by a suitable @xmath108-dependent function to resemble the data .",
    "both the original and the reweighted mc distributions are used in the analysis and any differences seen are included in the systematic uncertainty .",
    "only particles with a lifetime @xmath134  ns are used to define the primary charged hadronic multiplicity .",
    "the primary charged hadrons originate either directly from the primary interaction or from the decay of particles with a lifetime @xmath135  ns . the decay products of @xmath136 and @xmath137 particles are hence considered as primary hadrons in this analysis . the measured transverse momentum and pseudorapidity distributions of charged hadrons have to be corrected for the losses due to event and track selection cuts , the acceptance and the resolution of the detector .",
    "this is done using the mc events which were processed by the full detector simulation and reconstruction chain .",
    "the data are corrected by multiplying the experimental distribution , e.g.  of the transverse momentum @xmath138 , with correction factors which are calculated as the bin - by - bin ratio of the generated and the reconstructed mc distributions : @xmath139 the ratio is calculated using both pythia and phojet , with the mean value used to correct the data .",
    "the pseudorapidity distributions are corrected in the same way .",
    "this method only yields reliable results if migration effects between bins due to the finite resolution of the measurement are small .",
    "the bins of the @xmath108 and @xmath140 distributions have therefore been chosen to be significantly larger than the resolution expected from the mc simulation . to avoid regions where the detector has little or no acceptance , all measurements of charged hadron distributions",
    "were restricted to the range @xmath141 .",
    "the average transverse momentum @xmath142 and the average pseudorapidity @xmath143 in each bin is calculated directly from the data since detector corrections are small compared to the statistical uncertainties .    in order to be able to use eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] for the detector correction in each bin of @xmath124 , the bins in @xmath124 must be larger than the experimental resolution and the average reconstructed hadronic invariant mass , @xmath144 , should be approximately equal to the average generated hadronic invariant mass , @xmath145 . in this case",
    "bin - to - bin migrations are minimised .",
    "the visible invariant mass , @xmath146 , is determined from all tracks and calorimeter clusters , including the forward detectors and the silicon tungsten calorimeters , after applying a matching algorithm to avoid double counting of particle momenta  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of @xmath147 and @xmath146 depends on the event kinematics , and was therefore determined separately in two distinct regions of phase space .",
    "the discriminating variable chosen for this purpose is @xmath148 , the highest transverse momentum of any track in the event . the average visible hadronic invariant mass , @xmath149 , and the resolution on @xmath146 as a function of the generated hadronic invariant mass @xmath147 for events with @xmath148 smaller and larger than 5  gev are shown in fig .",

    "are also considered .",
    "the following sources of systematic uncertainties have been investigated :    * significant amounts of background need to be subtracted from the data at large @xmath108 , where the dominant source of background is multihadronic events ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the amount of this background subtracted from the data is varied by @xmath157% to estimate the uncertainty associated to this procedure .",
    "the amount by which the background must be varied is estimated from studying the mc description of the data in regions of the phase space where the background dominates .",
    "the effect on the measured cross - section is usually 1% or less for low transverse momenta , increasing to up to 7% at the highest momenta measured .",
    "* the selection criteria described in section  [ sec - evsel ] are varied simultaneously both to be more restrictive and to allow more events into the analysis to exclude a strong dependence on the event selection .",
