    "in the strongly correlated materials , the electronic fluctuation which derives from spin , orbital , charge , and lattice degrees of freedom plays a key role for the emergence of quantum phenomena , such as ferroelectricity , colossal magnetoresistance , and high - temperature superconductivity ( sc ) @xcite .",

    "it is likely that the magnetism of mn / cr disturbs the appearance of superconductivity  @xcite .",

    "the previous optical studies of co - ba122 revealed that multiple carriers contribute to low - energy charge dynamics , and an antiferromagnetic gap opens in a portion of fermi surfaces below @xmath4 , while this gap is diminished with co substitution @xcite . in order to find the origin of different substitution effects of co- and mn / cr - ba122 ,",
    "it is worth to compare the low - energy charge dynamics of these systems .    in this work , we measured optical spectra of mn / cr - ba122 single crystal and compared the results with those of co - ba122 .",

    "the doping dependence of spectral weight of mn / cr - ba122 is different from that of co - ba122 where @xmath41monotonically increases with co substitution and @xmath42is almost doping independent .",
    "since @xmath42is one order larger than @xmath41 , it turns out that the total drude spectral weight is governed by the incoherent term in mn / cr - ba122 .",

    "the signature of local magnetic order becomes unclear in the optical spectra.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +    another and more remarkable feature induced by mn / cr substitution is a far - infrared peak structure that appears in the low - energy @xmath10 in the paramagnetic state .",
    "figure [ fig4](a ) shows the doping dependence of the new peak energy at 150  k and the afo gap peak energy at 5  k. the peak structure at a finite frequency is a signature of carrier localization .",
    "one of the possible origins is a precursor of the afo gap .",
    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , the new far - infrared peak shifts to higher energy with increasing mn / cr concentration , which is opposite to the behavior of the afo gap below @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that these two peaks are different in origin .",
    "the second possibility is the charge excitation from the doped mn and cr @xmath45 states .",
    "however , it can be ruled out because the peak energy changes with @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , the resonance photoemission measurements revealed that the partial density of state of doped mn and cr exists at 110  ev below the fermi energy @xcite , which is far from the energy expected from the observed peak ( @xmath47  mev ) .",
    "another possible origin is the disorder effect .",
    "actually , a similar low - energy peak is sometimes observed in disordered systems , such as zn - doped , ni - doped , and he - irradiated cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "thus the present results seem to be attributed to the disorder effect by mn / cr - substitution .",
    "however , this can not explain why such a disorder effect is not observed in co - ba122 where disorders are also introduced into fe planes @xcite .",
    "the difference of co and mn / cr is that the former is nonmagnetic and the latter is magnetic impurity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the interplay between the conduction electrons and the magnetic impurities should be considered .",
    "a representative interaction between the magnetic impurity and the conduction electron is that for the kondo effect .",
    "kondo materials or heavy - fermion systems , such as ybb@xmath48 and cecu@xmath2si@xmath2 @xcite , show a peak structure of @xmath10 in the far - infrared energy region .",
    "the @xmath14 dependence of @xmath12 of mn / cr - ba122 shows a small upturn above @xmath4 , which may be explained by the kondo effect @xcite .",
    "however , the dynamical mean - field theory @xcite suggests that a multiband system with large hund s coupling @xmath49 has a significantly reduced kondo @xmath14 , and a large @xmath49 value is required to explain the observed electronic structure of mn - ba122 @xcite .",
    "this is inconsistent with the present observation that the peak structure in @xmath10is already present above @xmath4which is much higher than the expected kondo @xmath14 .",
    "the compelling origin is the cooperative effect between magnetic impurities and conduction electrons .",
    "gastiasoro and andersen have theoretically proposed that the magnetic moment of doped impurities interacts with the magnetic fluctuation of itinerant electrons and induces a local magnetic order around the impurities even in the paramagnetic state of iron pnictides @xcite .",
    "a schematic illustration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "a small amount of magnetic impurities induces a local nel - type magnetic order above @xmath4 . at the higher concentrations of magnetic impurity , the stripe - type magnetic order is dominant even above @xmath4due to the cooperative effect of the magnetic impurities and conduction electrons",
    "this theory can explain the previous experimental observation in mn - ba122 that nel- and stripe - type magnetic orders coexist and a tetragonal - stripe type magnetic order emerges in the higher doping range @xcite .",
    "such a cooperative effect can cause the strong suppression of the coherent carrier transport , and it is one of the possible origins for the localization peak observed above @xmath4 , although gastiasoro and andersen did not calculate any optical response in their work @xcite .",
    "the increase of the peak energy with @xmath46 reflects the characteristic mechanism of carrier localization in which interaction strength between local magnetic moments around impurities increases with impurity concentration . in this scenario",
    ", the fact that the increasing rate of the impurity - induced peak energy is larger in mn - ba122 than in cr - ba122 ( fig .  [ fig4](a ) ) implies the difference of interaction strength between these systems .",
    "this difference results in the different phase diagram ( fig .",
    "1 ) where antiferromagnetic - tetragonal order appears above @xmath16 in mn - ba122 @xcite , while the original antiferromagnetic - orthorhombic order persists up to @xmath50 in cr - ba122 @xcite . however , so far there has been no theoretical calculation of the charge dynamics as a function of impurity concentration in iron pnictides .",
    "more detailed theoretical study is required .",
    "the localization peak seen above @xmath4becomes invisible below @xmath4@xcite , and instead the afo gap structure appears as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2](d)[fig2](i ) .",
    "this is because the long - range antiferromagnetic order dominates the system as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) . in the afo phase ,",
    "the coherent drude term of mn / cr - ba122 is more strongly suppressed than that of co - ba122 , which demonstrates that mn and cr act as strong scattering centers also in the afo state .",
    "the loss of carrier coherence due to magnetic impurities ( mn and cr ) prevents the appearance of sc , although the conventional magnetic pair breaking could be another source for non - sc @xcite .",
    "then , it is understandable that sc is not observed in mn / cr - ba122 even though @xmath4is well suppressed by mn / cr substitution , in contrast to the case of co - ba122 @xcite , where the coherent drude component well survives with co substitution .",
    "we performed @xmath10measurements on mn / cr - ba122 .",
    "the coherent component of @xmath10is strongly suppressed by magnetic mn / cr - substitution both in the paramagnetic and the afo states .",
    "this result demonstrates that the coherent carriers are strongly scattered by the magnetic impurity ( mn / cr ) although carrier scattering by the nonmagnetic impurity ( co ) is very weak in iron pnictides .",
    "the rapid suppression of coherent carries transport is one of the factors to hinder the appearance of sc . in the paramagnetic phase above @xmath4 , we found the magnetic impurity - induced peak in the far - infrared spectra that shifts to higher energy with increasing mn / cr concentration .",
    "we attribute this anomalous carrier localization to the cooperative effect between conduction electrons and magnetic impurities .",
