    "geodesic equation in metric ( [ tt_metric ] ) dictates that the test mass coordinates are not changed by gravitational wave @xcite , i.e. gw does not interact with the test masses in the tt gauge .",
    "nevertheless , it noticeably changes the phase of electromagnetic wave ( emw for short ) which propagates in the region of space - time where gravitational wave is present .",
    "the elementary solution of eikonal equation for a single arm of laser interferometer @xcite states that the phase shift is proportional to gw signal : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the wavenumber of electromagnetic wave and @xmath11 is the interferometer arm length . in other words",
    "one can reduce the analysis of a +-polarized gw interaction with detector to the problem of emw propagation in the medium with effective refraction index @xmath12 .",
    "this result is only valid in long - wave approximation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the length of gravitational wave . in general case",
    "the formula for phase shift is more complex but it is still the solution of the eikonal equation .",
    "the significant advantage of the tt gauge is the ease of going from long - wave approximation to the general case @xcite .",
    "however , the crucial requirement of the test masses inertiality can not be met in the real earth - based experiments since there exists a great amount of non - gravitational forces acting on the test masses , such as seismic and thermal fluctuating forces , light pressure resulting in ponderomotive rigidity @xcite and radiative friction @xcite .",
    "the latter two phenomena appear if fabry - perot ( fp ) cavities are utilized in the interferometer as in ligo and virgo detectors @xcite .",
    "therefore , the reference frame of the tt gauge can hardly be constructed for the earth - based detectors .",
    "correspondingly , the results obtained within the bounds of the tt gauge are only applicable when condition of the test masses inertiality is met ( the case of space gw antenna lisa @xcite in which drag - free technique will be used ) .",
    "otherwise , additional analysis should be performed in order to validate the tt - based consideration of non - geodesic motion .",

    "one can reduce the analysis of a +-polarized gw interaction with detector to the problem of emw propagation in the volume without effective medium ( in long - wave approximation only ! ) but with movable boundaries .    however , the ll gauge has one great disadvantage  the complexity of going from long - wave approximation to the general case . in this paper",
    "we are mostly interested in the latter because still little is known about the particular features of non - inertial test masses motion under the influence of gravitational wave when condition @xmath13 is violated . in this sense",
    "we are mostly interested in the phenomenon of optical rigidity ( or optical spring ) and its role in detection of high frequency gw signals .",
    "it is most likely that the optical strings will be implemented in the future generations of the earth - based detectors ( such as advanced ligo ) , allowing significant amplification of the response to gw signals .",
    "general formulas for optical rigidity , test masses motion and detector response signal outside of the range of long - wave approximation were obtained in ref .",
    "starting from the ideas of ref .",
    "@xcite we propose an independent derivation of general formulas and obtain a good agreement with results of ref .",
    "@xcite on the one hand , and of @xcite on the other .",
    "our calculations allow us to take into account the relativistic correction to the force of radiation pressure , known as radiative friction @xcite , which was not obtained in ref .",
    "using modern notations we further analyze the gw- and radiation pressure - driven motion of test masses , paying close attention to general relativistic aspects of the problem .",
    "we also study in detail the differences between the general case and its long - wave approximation .",
    "it should be noted that we deal only with the optimal gw polarization and detector orientation ( +-polarized gw with one of its principal axes parallel to the axis of fp cavity ) since it is enough for consideration of the radiation pressure - induced dynamics .",
    "motivation for our work is the following .",
    "modern gw detectors , utilizing fabry - perot cavities , with arm lengths of several kilometers ( 4 km for ligo and 3 km for virgo ) are best suited for detection of gw signals with frequencies that lie in the region of @xmath18 to @xmath19 hz .",
    "for them @xmath20 and long - wave approximation holds with high accuracy .",
    "today the most efforts are made to detect these low - frequency signals which are emitted , for example , by binary pulsars , rotating neutron stars , supernova explosions etc .",
    "however , modern astrophysical and cosmological theories predict the existence of sources of high - frequency ( @xmath21 hz ) gw signals , such as relic gravitational wave background @xcite . some models , such as inflation , predict the gw spectrum of the background with typical values of amplitude which are far beyond the sensitivity of even advanced interferometers",
    ". however , the spectrum of gravitational waves predicted by string cosmology @xcite has rather big typical gw amplitude which rises with increasing frequency , thus allowing the potential possibility of detection of gws with certain frequencies above @xmath19 hz on the earth - based detectors .",
    "there is a strong evidence that modern and future detectors are ( or will be ) capable of detecting signals at frequencies about @xmath22 hz .",
    "for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) it was proposed that 4 km ligo detectors could detect 37.5 khz signals , corresponding to cavity free spectral range ( fsr ) , for which @xmath23 , thus operating outside of long - wave regime . and",
    "though in this case the response signal vanishes for optimal polarization of gravitational wave @xcite , gw signals can still be detected with enhanced sensitivity at multiples of the cavity fsr for other orientations .",
    "however , the role of radiation pressure effects in the detection of high - frequency gws when condition @xmath24 is violated ( especially in the vicinity of fsr and its multiples ) has not been recognized up to date .",
    "we propose the study of these effects , since the searches for gw background are planned for the advanced ligo stage where optical springs will be utilized .",

    "the generalization for quantized em fields is straightforward : classical field amplitudes should be replaced with corresponding annihilation operators and complex conjugates  with hermitian conjugates .",
    "we represent the optical field inside the cavity as a sum of two light waves : the one @xmath84 running in the positive direction of the @xmath39-axis and another one @xmath85 running in the opposite direction .",

    "@xmath88    we assume interaction between a gravitational wave @xmath44 and `` weak '' field @xmath89 to be a negligible effect since ( i ) it is most likely that coupling of gws to optical noises does not contain any useful information and ( ii ) coupling of gws to phase shift ( variation of optical field ) acquired due to gw itself leads to the negligible @xmath90 terms .",
    "output wave @xmath91 includes the wave reflected from the input mirror and the wave flowing out of the cavity .",
    "the latter one carries information about gravitational wave ( signal wave ) along with optical noises .",
    "again we represent the wave as a sum of `` strong '' and `` weak '' components : @xmath92    our problem is to find connection between @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",

    "we would like to stress that this boundary condition automatically allows us to take into account the terms proportional to @xmath106 which lead to the appearance of the force of radiative friction ( see sec .",
    "[ eq_of_mot ] ) .",
    "strictly speaking , we can not use lorentz transformations to change the reference frame in our case since space - time is curved .",
    "however , one can verify that corrections to formulas of lorentz transformations due to gravitational wave are negligible .",
    "we assume further that mirror s displacement @xmath107 .",
