    "it is widely recognized that galaxy properties such as star - formation rate ( sfr ) and morphology depend on the environment in which the galaxies reside ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "local galaxy clusters are dominated by red quiescent ellipticals and s0s , and their tight colour  magnitude relation suggests very old stellar populations in these cluster galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this means that many present - day cluster galaxies must have formed their stars in the early universe at @xmath16 , and therefore distant clusters of galaxies are an ideal site for studying this early evolutionary stage of cluster galaxies .",
    "earlier studies have identified a high fraction of star - forming population in distant clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to this blue star - forming population , optically red star - forming galaxies , as well as a starbursting population revealed by mid - infrared ( mir ) and radio observations are also reported to increase in frequency in distant clusters ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , particularly in the cluster outskirts ( e.g.  @xcite ; 2011 ) . in the very rich cluster cores , however , the star - forming galaxy fraction is still very low up to @xmath14 ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , suggesting that the major phase of star formation for galaxies in these regions must be occurring at an even earlier epoch .",
    "indeed some recent studies have also suggested a `` reversal '' of star formation ",
    "density relation at @xmath14 ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) in high - density environments in the distant universe . therefore",
    ", the next challenge must be to study directly the site of cluster galaxy formation at @xmath16 .",
    "new surveys have unveiled several clusters of galaxies at these early times , @xmath17 , using a variety of techniques ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and these are good laboratories for studying the early activity of cluster galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) . by conducting an [ oii ] emission - line survey of a @xmath18 cluster with the subaru telescope ,",
    "@xcite first noted a large fraction of [ oii ] galaxies in the cluster , and they highlighted the high activity of cluster core galaxies at @xmath19 .",
    "subsequent studies of similarly high - redshift clusters also confirm active galaxy populations in these high - density environments ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , suggesting we are approaching the formation epoch of present - day cluster galaxies .",
    "it is still challenging to detect over - dense regions in the more distant universe at @xmath20 ( i.e.  the peak epoch of galaxy activity in the general field population ; e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "bright high - redshift radio galaxies or quasors ( qsos ) , or indeed overdensities comprising several qsos , have been used as landmarks of high - redshift over - dense regions .",
    "this approach has been successful in the last decade , and many `` proto - clusters '' have been identified ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the most effective ways to select `` member '' galaxies associated to the proto - clusters is to exploit narrow - band filters to pick up strong emission - lines ( such as ly@xmath0 , [ oii ] or h@xmath0 ) at the particular redshifts ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; 2004a ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . considering the importance of dust - obscured activity in the early universe as stated above",
    ", the h@xmath0 line is the preferred tracer because it is less affected by dust extinction ( or metallicity ) compared to other strong lines emitted in the rest - frame optical or ultra - violet ( uv ) , which tend to be biased to lower - metallicity galaxies with little dust extinction .",
    "an observational challenge is that the h@xmath0 lines of distant galaxies ( at @xmath21 ) shift to near - infrared regime ( nir ) , where the night sky emission is strong , and where efficient large format of detectors became available only recently .",
    "the pks1138@xmath2262 field is one of the best - studied proto - clusters , centered on a radio galaxy at @xmath22 , and importantly , the h@xmath0 line from this redshift falls in between the night sky emission lines in the nir and can be observed with ground - based telescopes ( @xciteb ) .",
    "the central radio galaxy ( pks1138 ) is one of the brightest radio galaxies known at @xmath20 with a clumpy morphology in the optical ( @xcite ; 1998 ) and distorted morphology in radio ( @xcite ; 2002 ) .",
    "the pioneering ly@xmath0 imaging and spectroscopy around this radio galaxy was performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "those studies spectroscopically confirmed 14 ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies at @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite used x - ray observations to identify 18 x - ray sources in the pks1138 field , among which five were confirmed to be cluster members by subsequent spectroscopic campaign of this field ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "an intensive search for h@xmath0 emitters and extremely red objects ( eros ) was also performed by @xcite with vlt .",
    "they reported @xmath340 h@xmath0 emitter candidates within a @xmath24arcmin@xmath25 field , 9 of them being spectroscopically confirmed ( 3 have detectable h@xmath0+[nii ] emission in their nir spectra ; see @xcite for details ) .",
    "following these studies , more recent work has also found further evidence that the pks1138 is a forming proto - cluster ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; 2009 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . given the strong evidence of the over - density of galaxies",

    "the data quality is effectively uniform , but the limiting magnitudes differ slightly between the pks1138-c and pks1138-s fields , due to the small differences in their total exposure times ( see table  1 ) .",

    "we find 83 sources satisfying these criteria in total ( fig .",

    "most of the nb emitters are located in the top - left region of the _ bzk _ diagram ( i.e.  satisfying the _ sbzk _ criteria ) , supporting that they are star - forming population . excluding the sources close to bright stars ( for which @xmath44/@xmath43 photometry is not possible ) , we find that 48 out of 56 ( 85% ) nb2071 emitters detected in both @xmath43 and @xmath31 within the @xmath44-band data coverage satisfy the _ bzk _ selection criteria . among the eight sources which fall outside the _ bzk _ criteria ,",

    "[ fig : bzk ] the _ bzk _ colours of 14 spectroscopic members of the pks1138 structure reported in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and detected in our catalogue .",
    "all the members satisfy the _",
    "_ criteria ( within the errors ) as expected , except for one x - ray detected galaxy at @xmath73 .",
    "this should not be surprising as the strong active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity in this galaxy affects its broadband colours .",
    "the _ bzk _ selection may not be entirely suitable for excluding the high - redshift contamination ( i.e.  [ oiii ] emitters at @xmath74 ) which may be a concern .",
    "this would require deep spectroscopy for all of the sources to fully understand the contamination rates , but this is not available .",
    "we therefore check the photometric redshifts ( photo-@xmath75 ) of our nb emitters derived by @xcite . due to the lack of multiband photometry in the southern half of our field , we can derive photometric redshifts for only 40 bright emitters ( around half of our full h@xmath0 emitter sample ) located in the northern half of our survey .",
    "although it is not easy to derive accurate photo-@xmath75 s for @xmath20 galaxies , particularly for star - forming galaxies with relatively flat spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , our photometric redshift analysis shows that @xmath3770% of emitters have @xmath761.82.4 ( the majority of outliers show @xmath77 ) , supporting our claim that a majority of nb2071 emitters are h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath1 .",
    "the contamination rate may of course be higher in the southern part of our survey field . however , a similar depth narrow - band study of @xmath78 h@xmath0 emitters by @xcite estimate that the high - redshift contamination ( i.e.  [ oiii ] emitters at @xmath74 ) into the nb emitters ( selected at @xmath32@xmath12 m ) is negligibly small , by applying the lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) technique ( they find only one source satisfying the lbg selection from 180 emitters in their whole sample ) .",
    "based on this estimate , we expect that the high - redshift contamination into our sample would be negligibly small . in summary",
    ", we estimate the total contamination rate would be @xmath7910% , even if we consider all non-_bzk _ galaxies as contamination . in this paper , we assume all the 83 nb emitters are h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath1 , but the results do not change if we apply either the _ bzk _ or photo-@xmath75 selections .",
    "recent studies showed that the fraction of agn increases towards high - redshift clusters ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although we expect that the majority of our h@xmath0-selected sources are star - forming galaxies , a fraction of h@xmath0 emitters might be powered by agns , and so we here check the possible contribution of agns into our sample .",
    "firstly , we match our sample with the _ chandra _ x - ray catalogue ( down to a 0.52 kev flux of @xmath310@xmath80 ergs@xmath5@xmath65 ) presented by @xcite , and find that five of our h@xmath0 emitters are detected in the soft x - ray band : the source ids of # 3 , # 5 , # 6 , # 7 ( = radio galaxy ) , and # 17 in the nomenclature of @xcite .",
    "we find that all of them are known proto - cluster members from the subsequent nir / optical spectroscopy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and so our survey confirms h@xmath0 emission from all of them , while we do not find any additional candidate x - ray agns .",
    "secondly , we check the seds of the h@xmath0 emitters , using the best - fit seds derived from the updated code of @xcite .",
    "the sed fitting was performed for 40 h@xmath0 emitters in the pks1138-c field where multi - band data are available .",
    "although we are aware of significant uncertainties in our sed fitting , we find that most of our h@xmath0 emitters are fit by star - forming galaxy templates , and that passive seds are a minority .",
    "we also check the dust extinction ( @xmath81 ) estimated from the sed fitting .",
    "an accurate estimate of dust extinction from sed fitting is extremely difficult , due to the degeneracies of age , metallicity and dust extinction , but we find a weak trend that those h@xmath0 emitters with red @xmath82 colours tend to display higher extinction ( @xmath83 mag ) , compared to blue galaxies ( @xmath84 mag ) .",
    "this would also suggest that the red h@xmath0 emitters are likely to be star forming , rather than dust - free , passive galaxies .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we assume all the h@xmath0 emitters ( including five x - ray detected sources ) are star forming , although we can not completely rule out the presence of agns without deep spectroscopy for all of them .      the transformation from rest - frame luminosity to stellar mass has the least dispersion ( due to different star formation histories and reddening ) in the nir bands .",
    "unfortunately , the _ spitzer _",
    "irac ( restframe nir at @xmath1 ) coverage of our field is incomplete and so we choose to use the more complete @xmath31-band imaging to estimate stellar masses .",
    "we confirm that the two techniques agree by comparing the stellar masses derived with the simple @xmath31-band method described below , with those derived from the sed fitting including _ spitzer _ irac photometry by @xcite ( using the @xcite stellar population synthesis model ) .",
    "we find excellent agreement , at least for the brightest sources where the sed fitting is possible .",
    "hence , as the sed fitting can only be performed for the brighter sources at the northern half of our survey ( those with irac coverage ) , we use the @xmath31-band estimates for all our sample in this paper to keep consistency throughout the field .    the stellar mass estimates from the @xmath31-band",
    "use the observed galaxy luminosity and take into account the variation in mass to light ratio ( @xmath85 ) of the galaxies , dependent upon their star formation history ( or equivalently their observed colours ) , by exploiting the following equation : @xmath86 which is derived by simple scaling of the model galaxies with @xmath87 ( with @xmath88 ) from @xcite , assuming a formation redshift of @xmath89 .",
    "the colour dependence of mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath85 ) is included in the last term , @xmath90@xmath91 $ ] , which is derived by fitting the model galaxies with a range of star - formation histories ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use @xmath92 colour which neatly straddles the redshifted 4000  break providing a sensitive tracer of the typical age of the stellar populations in these galaxies .",
    "unfortunately we find that there are two h@xmath0 emitters near a bright star for which accurate optical photometry is not possible .",
    "for these two sources we instead use the @xmath82 colour to predict the @xmath85 using the same model with @xmath93@xmath94 .",
    "we verified that this method provides consistent results with those derived using @xmath92 colour .",
    "we also rescale the stellar mass using the @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) for consistency with the derivation of sfrs as described below .",
    "finally , we correct for the stellar mass accounting for the contribution of h@xmath0 emission line flux to the broad - band photometry , using our measured nb fluxes .    applying different models or imfs would slightly change the absolute measurements of @xmath13 , but the trend we show in this paper does not change if we apply different models / imfs . indeed",
    ", we verified that our conclusions do not alter if we apply an empirical conversion from @xmath95-band photometry to @xmath13 ( with @xmath85 correction depending on @xmath66 colour ) using the sed fitting results for @xmath96 h@xmath0 emitters from hizels ( d.  sobral ; private communication ) , which assumes the updated version of @xcite model and @xcite imfs .",

    "a caveat on this plot is that the lack of low - mass red sources is partly due to the @xmath30-band flux limit ( see the colour  magnitude diagram in fig .",

    "although the significance is not great ( 1.7-@xmath57 level ) , this may be an interesting implication that galaxies have evolved more rapidly in high - density , cluster environments than in the lower - density field environment at @xmath141 ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "we find that the pks1138 proto - cluster is embedded in a @xmath12110 mpc - scale filament traced by h@xmath0 emitters and extending from north - east to south - west through the radio galaxy .",
    "we also find a possible filament running towards south - east from the radio galaxy , suggesting that the pks1138 field is located at a node of the cosmic web at @xmath1 .",
    "several emitters are likely to be agn ( five are x - ray detected ) , but we expect that the majority of our sample are star - forming galaxies , based on the sed analysis and on their clumpy / extended rest - frame uv morphologies in _ hst _ imaging .",
    "\\(2 ) galaxies in the @xmath71 proto - cluster environment tend to have redder colours and higher stellar masses ( and probably larger sfrs ) compared to those in underdense regions .",
    "in particular , we find that a substantial fraction of h@xmath0 emitters in pks1138 show red colours with @xmath144 , and in some extreme cases , they satisfy the drg criteria .",
    "such red h@xmath0 emitters tend to have very large stellar masses ( @xmath910@xmath10 ) , compared to the more normal blue galaxies .",
    "this is an evidence that while many cluster galaxies are still in a vigorously star - forming phase , they have already formed a large part of their stellar mass by @xmath11 .",
    "\\(3 ) the red h@xmath0 emitters tend to be detected in the _ spitzer _ mips 24@xmath12 m imaging , suggesting they are luminous and dusty . within the mips data coverage , we find that 14 out of 29 ( 48% ) are detected at 24@xmath12 m from our photometrically - defined sample of red / green emitters , while only 1 out of 24 ( 4% ) is detected for the blue emitter sample .",
    "such 24@xmath12m - detected h@xmath0 emitters are estimated to have sfr@xmath119100m@xmath112yr@xmath5 ( i.e.  ulirg class ) and heavy dust extinction with @xmath1453 mag .",
    "therefore we suggest that these intense starbursts are a common population in the young proto - cluster environment , while they are absent from the cores of lower redshift cluster at @xmath146 .",
    "\\(4 ) the red h@xmath0 emitters may be a cluster phenomenon .",
    "our survey reveals that the red h@xmath0 emitters are preferentially found in the higher - density proto - cluster region , while the blue h@xmath0 emitters are more widely spread .",
    "therefore , we expect that the red , massive star - forming galaxies are the key population driven by environmental effects in the early universe , which go onto become present - day passive cluster galaxies .",
    "\\(5 ) the h@xmath0 emitters in proto - cluster environments are on broadly the same `` main sequence '' of @xmath11 star - forming galaxies as those in the field , but there is an excess of massive systems compared to lower - density environments . in contrast , this trend may not be present at @xmath14 , where the most massive galaxies in high - density regions are not forming stars any more .",
    "we also find a tentative hint that the star - forming galaxies in cluster environments at @xmath139 may have lower star - formation activity than in field at the same redshift , implying that the accelerated galaxy evolution we see is associated with the cluster environment at @xmath141 .",
