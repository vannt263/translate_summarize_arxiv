    "cavity optomechanics  @xcite explores the quantum dynamics of electromagnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom coupled by radiation forces . during the last decade , tremendous progress was made in the direction of gaining quantum control over optomechanical systems , including the demonstration of cooling  @xcite and strong coupling  @xcite in optical setups .",
    "while in typical experiments a laser strongly pumps the optical resonator in order to increase the optomechanical coupling , recent advancements develop towards the regime where the radiative forces of single photons are strong enough to displace the mechanical elements on the order of its ground - state wavepacket fluctuations  @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the non - linear nature of the optomechanical coupling can manifests itself in phenomenons like photon blockade effect  @xcite , creation of non - classical states  @xcite , and distinct cooling behaviour becomes apparent  @xcite .    in virtue of the success in atomic physics and cavity quantum electrodynamics",
    "@xcite with its well - developed techniques for manipulation of atoms , it is not far to couple atoms with optomechanical cavities .",
    "such hybrid devices can combine the advantages of the different components and provide an additional degree of freedom for controlling the cavity - oscillator system .",
    "strong coupling of the center - of - mass motion of an atom with an optomechanical device was proposed  @xcite , and the backaction of atoms on a mechanical element and vice versa has been demonstrated recently  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there exist first studies about the electronic dynamics of the atom coupled in such setups  @xcite .    in this work we consider an optomechanical cavity interacting with a single two - level system close to the regime where single - photon effects become important .",
    "we focus here on the internal degree of freedom of the two - level system , and neglect its center - of - mass motion .",
    "possible realizations of such a setup could be a single atom tightly trapped inside an optical resonator with pendular end - mirror , an artificial atom inside an optomechanical photonic crystal cavity , or a photonic crystal in diamond  @xcite coupled to mechanical motion , where a nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center  @xcite realizes the two - level system .",
    "for such a tri - partite system consisting of a spin degree of freedom , the electromagnetic field of the considered cavity mode , and the mechanical oscillator , we investigate the light scattering at the most fundamental level where a single atom , single photons and single mechanical excitations interact with each other .",
    "the treatment here will be in a regime analogous to the lamb - dicke regime of atoms in traps  @xcite , where the optomechanical coupling is weak enough to consider it as a perturbation , but still exhibits noticeable effects on the single photon level .",
    "the light scattering at an optomechanical cavity in the single - photon strong coupling regime without atoms was recently investigated  @xcite .",
    "the modulation of the intra - cavity field by the mechanical frequency manifests itself in sidebands appearing in the cavity output spectrum .",
    "these features , when used for cooling , give rise to several resonances in the cooling rate  @xcite and lead to non - thermal stationary states in the final stage of the cooling .    in the work presented here ,",
    "only the stokes- and anti - stokes sidebands are taken into account , in accordance with the assumption of sufficiently weak mechanical interaction . as an additional effect ,",
    "the presence of the two - level system , strongly coupled to the cavity , changes the optical properties of the composite system drastically . for a fixed cavity interacting with an atom ,",
    "cavity induced transparency  @xcite can emerge , an effect which prohibits the excitation of the atom due to quantum interference .",
    "we will identify a similar interference , which involves cavity , mechanical and atomic degrees of freedom . as a main result",
    ", we find that in the bad cavity limit , the stokes - component of the scattered light can thereby be suppressed , what allows to cool the motion of the mirror ideally close to its ground state , even when the cavity line width is larger than the mechanical oscillation frequency .",
    "moreover , we identify the underlying physical processes of light scattering which include mechanical action .    for a strongly driven optomechanical cavity",
    ", a cooling scheme was proposed  @xcite using a cloud of three - level atoms inside the cavity in order to tailor the cavity s excitation spectrum with the help of electromagnetic induced transparency ( eit ) to enhance cooling of the mechanical element .",
    "in contrast to this approach , where the atomic cloud acts as an eit media inside the cavity , here we focus on the strong interaction of elementary excitations of cavity , mechanical object and a single two - level system .",
    "quantum interference effects can not be accredited to the medium , but appear on a more fundamental level in the dynamics involving hybrid quantum states of all degrees of freedom .",

    "the basic assumptions are introduced . in sec .",

    ", one has @xmath189 . in a cryogenic environment and for @xmath190 ,",
    "realizable with current  @xcite or near - future technology  @xcite , notable signatures of the quantum interference involving the atomic , photonic and mechanical quantum degrees of freedom should be detectable in the cooling dynamics , in such a way demonstrating the coherent dynamics of the composite system .",
    "in this article we analyzed the light scattering in an optomechanical system , consisting of an optical resonator coupled to a mechanical oscillator , where the electromagnetic field inside the cavity interacts strongly with a single two - level system .",
    "the analysis was performed in the limit of weak excitation of the system by a pump laser , and for sufficiently weak mechanical interaction .",
    "we found that the presence of the atom changes the optical properties of the cavity drastically , and gives rise to interference effects in the scattering processes , allowing to strongly suppress the stokes scattered light when the decay of the system predominantly takes place due to cavity losses .",
    "then , ideally , the oscillator can be cooled down close to its ground state .",
    "apart from the interference effect the model also predicts cooling regions when the pump is detuned to the red sideband of the relevant dressed states of the two - level  cavity system , what leads , depending on the effective linewidth of the resonances , to doppler or sideband cooling like schemes .    in our approach , we took into account the radiation pressure between light and mechanical oscillator , but ignored mechanical corrections in the atom - light interaction  @xcite which modifies the jaynes - cummings term due to the motion of the mechanical element .",
    "such a term @xmath191 is typically a small correction , and is only expected to become important for ultra strong atom - cavity coupling , which might arise in certain setups , for example in solid states devices  @xcite , or when simultaneously several atoms are excited by a single photon  @xcite .",
    "such an interaction leads to a description analogous to cooling the center - of - mass motion of an _ atom _ by cavity cooling in the low excitation limit  @xcite .",
    "also in this case , one finds interference effects which can strongly influence the cooling .",
    "if both couplings are equally strong , the corresponding cooling processes can interfere and give rise to a complicated cooling dynamics of the mechanical oscillator resulting from the interplay of radiation pressure coupling and the oscillator - position dependent coupling to the atom .",
    "the analysis of the light scattering provided in this work can be relevant for future hybrid quantum systems , where a spin - like system is coupled to an optomechanical device , which might be realized in solid state system or for nv - centers coupled to a photonic crystal cavity which is sensible to vibrations of the structured diamond bulk .",
    "in this appendix we perform the evaluation of the transition matrix elements , eq .  , under the assumptions  , what finally leads to the form given in eq .  .",
    "the emission of the photon at the end of the scattering process can be caused either by cavity losses or by spontaneous emission , and hence , we can distinguish between two transition amplitudes @xmath192 with @xmath193 . for writing down eq .",
    ", we used the definitions eq .  , eq .",
    ". moreover , we already expanded the transition matrix elements up to first order in the smallness parameters , eqs .  , and introduced the effective hamiltonian @xmath194 , which expresses the radiative instability of the atomic and cavity s excited states  @xcite .",
    "the radiation pressure , described by the term @xmath195 in eq .  , only contributes for a finite number of photons in the cavity .",
    "consequently , one only finds a contribution to scattering , when the transition passes through the state @xmath196 , and thus the transition matrix elements @xmath197 \\label{eq : tpm2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are a product of the amplitudes @xmath198 here , @xmath199 is the probability amplitude to excite the cavity by the laser , while @xmath94 is proportional to the probability amplitude of a decay either due to spontaneous emission ( @xmath92 ) or cavity loss ( @xmath91 ) , when the cavity was initially excited and the vibrational quantum number changed by one . in eq .",
    "we also introduced the factor @xmath200 whereby the symbol @xmath201 gives unity for stokes scattering ( @xmath96-case ) and otherwise vanishes .",
