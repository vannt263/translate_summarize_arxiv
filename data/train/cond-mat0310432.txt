    "the collective behavior of condensed modulated structures like charge or spin density waves ( cdws / sdws )  @xcite , flux line lattices  @xcite and wigner crystals  @xcite in random environments has been the subject of detailed investigations since the early 1970s .",
    "these were motivated by the drastic influence of disorder : without pinning cdws would be ideal superconductors whereas type - ii superconductors would show finite resistivity . in three dimensional systems",
    "the low temperature phase of these structures is determined by a zero temperature disorder fixed point resulting in quasi - long - range order and glassy dynamics ( for recent reviews and further references see [ ] ) . in two dimensions this fixed point",
    "is extended to a fixed line which terminates at the glass transition temperature  @xcite . in the low temperature phase ,",
    "correlations of the positional order decay slightly faster than a power law and the linear resistivity vanishes  @xcite .    in one dimension",
    "the situation is different : the glass temperature is shifted to @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , there remains a residual trace of disorder which is reflected in the low temperature behavior of spatial correlations and the dynamics  @xcite . clearly , at low temperatures also quantum fluctuations have to be taken into account .",
    "disorder and quantum fluctuations in @xmath1d cdws at zero temperature have been considered previously ( see , e.g. , [ ] ) and an unpinning ( delocalization ) transition as a function of the strength of quantum fluctuations was found .",
    "finite temperature effects were partially incorporated by truncating the renormalization group ( rg ) flow at the de broglie wave length of the phason excitations  @xcite . however , for a complete study of the thermal to quantum crossover , quantum and thermal fluctuations have to be considered on an equal footing  @xcite , which is the main aim of this paper .",
    "experimentally , quasi1d behavior can be seen in real materials , e.g. , in whiskers  @xcite , hairlike single crystal fibers like @xmath2 , with a transverse extension smaller than the correlation length or in chain like crystals with weak interchain coupling . in the latter case",
    "there is a large crossover length scale up to which 1d behavior can be observed  @xcite .",
    "the results obtained for the cdws or sdws have a large number of further applications on disordered quantum systems : they relate , e.g. , to the localization transition of luttinger liquids  @xcite , superfluids  @xcite , tunnel junction chains  @xcite , josephson coupled chains of these systems , if the coupling is treated in mean - field theory  @xcite , and cdws in a lattice potential .",
    "however , we will use the terminology of cdws in most parts of this paper .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec.model ] we give a detailed introduction to our model and the notation used in this paper .",
    "we also briefly discuss the influence of coulomb interaction on the properties of the system . in section [ sec.disorder ]",
    "the influence of the disorder is studied in detail . using an anisotropic momentum shell renormalization group calculation , in which the full matsubara sum over frequncies is performed , we obtain flow equations for the effective strength of the disorder , thermal and quantum fluctuations ( i.e. , the interaction strength in the case of luttinger liquids ) .",
    "these are discussed first in the case of zero temperature and agreement with previous results is obtained  @xcite . at finite temperatures",
    "the disorder always renormalizes to zero . in the classical limit",
    "two more methods are applied : ( i ) at low temperatures and strong disorder the ground state of the model is calculated exactly .",
    "( ii ) for weak disorder and strong thermal fluctuations a second rg calculation , based on the mapping onto the burgers equation with noise , is applied . using all these findings ,",
    "the phase diagram of the density - density correlation function is studied in section [ sec.cf ] .",
    "the main result of this section is the calculation of the low temperature quantum crossover diagram for one - dimensional cdws . in the following section [ sec.sf ] we discuss briefly the application of the results to superfluids by using the mapping to cdws .",
    "some of these results were previously presented in ref . .",
    "the influence of a commensurate lattice potential on a free density wave is considered in section [ sec.lp ] . the full finite temperature renormalization group flow equation for this sine - gordon type model",
    "are derived and resulting phase diagram is discussed .    in the appendices we present the calculation of the renormalization group flow equations and the derivation of the correlation function in the strong and weak pinning limit in some detail for the interested reader . in the final section of the appendix",
    "we list all symbols used in this paper with corresponding references in the paper .",
    "in this section we derive the effective hamiltonian which will be the starting point for our further treatment .",
    "the strategy of the calculation is therefore separated into two steps . in the first step",
    "the system is treated in a mean - field ( mf ) type approximation applied to a microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "this leaves us with a slowly varying complex order parameter field for which we derive an effective hamiltonian .",
    "the second step involves the consideration of the fluctuations of this order parameter , which is the topic of this paper .",
    "we briefly summarize now the result of the mean - field calculation : well below the mean - field condensation temperature @xmath3 of the cdw , the underlying lattice will be periodically distorted with a period @xmath4 which is related to the fermi wave vector @xmath5 by @xmath6 .",
    "this distortion of the lattice leads to the formation of a gap in the dispersion relation at @xmath7 which is ( in one dimension ) proportional to the amplitude of the lattice modulation . for small displacements ( which are typically smaller than @xmath8 of the interatomic spacing  @xcite ) , the increase of the elastic energy is smaller than the gain of electronic energy due to the formation of the gap and hence an instability is favored .",
    "the period of the cdw depends on the band filling factor ( via @xmath9 ) and is in general at arbitrary band filling incommensurate with the undistorted lattice ( with lattice constant @xmath10 )",
    ".    in ( quasi-)one  dimensional systems  @xcite also sdws can be found , but in contrast to cdws they arise due to electron  electron and not to electron  phonon interaction .",
    "a sdw can be considered to consist of two cdws , one for spin  up and another for spin  down electrons ( see , e.g. , fig . 5 in [ ] ) .",
    "therefore the spatial modulation of sdws is characterized by a wave vector @xmath11 , as for cdws .",
    "the charge or spin density @xmath12 can be written in the form  @xcite @xmath13\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "at @xmath0 , @xmath61-values of the order @xmath67 to @xmath68 and @xmath1 , have been discussed for cdws and sdws , respectively  @xcite .",
    "it has to be noted however , that the the expressions relating @xmath69 and @xmath70 to the microscopic ( mean - field - like ) theory lead to the conclusion that @xmath61 and @xmath60 diverge by approaching @xmath27 , whereas the ratio @xmath71 remains finite .",
    "we could also add a _",

    "in general the coulomb potential is screened and can be written as  @xcite @xmath80 with the momentum and frequency dependent polarization operator @xmath81 .",
    "if we only consider the static case @xmath82 we can distinguish two limiting cases : first , if the typical range @xmath83 of the screened coulomb potential @xmath73 is much smaller than the mean electron distance , the potential can be assumed to be a delta distribution and @xmath84 can be approximated by @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath87-terms ( @xmath88 ) from the density can be neglected due to strong fluctuations .",
    "therefore the coulomb interaction gives only an additional contribution to the elastic constant of the initial model : @xmath89 .",
    "for @xmath90 the coulomb interaction is repulsive , which leads to an increase of @xmath69 and therefore a decrease of the dimensionless parameter @xmath61 , i.e. , the quantum fluctuations will be reduced by the coulomb interaction . in the case",

    "however , the logarithmic @xmath94-dependence will only weakly affect our rg - analysis , but may suppress phase transitions , as discussed later in section [ ssec.zero ] .",
    "coulomb interaction is also important if one considers multi - channel systems@xcite or the effect of the non  condensated normal electrons .",
