    "the double - layer hydrated cobalt oxide superconductor na@xmath9coo@xmath121.3h@xmath3o @xcite has attracted great interests in the itinerant electron magnetism on a triangular lattice .",
    "the spin frustration effect on a triangular lattice has been believed to realize the resonating valence bond , so - called rvb state @xcite . at first",
    ", the effect of water intercalation was thought only to extend the interlayer distance between the coo@xmath3 layers .",
    "but now , it turns out that the diversity of the site occupation of na ions @xcite and of h@xmath13o@xmath14 oxonium ions @xcite makes the electronic phase rich . although the intercalated water molecules are the key ingredients for occurrence of superconductivity , the electronic effects on the coo@xmath3 planes are poorly understood .",
    "the parent non - hydrate na@xmath8coo@xmath3 is an itinerant electronic system with a strong thermoelectric power @xcite .",
    "the inelastic neutron scattering studies revealed the @xmath11-type spin fluctuations on the coo@xmath3 planes , i.e. intra - plane ferromagnetic and inter - plane antiferromagnetic instability at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the electrical resistivity shows characteristic of a magnetic quantum critical point @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0na nuclear spin - lattice relaxation time indicates the existence of two dimensional ferromagnetic spin fluctuations at low temperatures @xcite and suggests the motion of na ions at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "the detailed @xmath0na nmr study revealed the vital role of charge degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "we recently found successful synthesis methods of the non - superconducting double - layer hydrates with @xmath151.8 k and the derivative superconducting hydrates with @xmath164.5 k @xcite . in this paper , we report @xmath0na nmr studies for the non - superconducting , the derivative superconducting double - layer hydrates and the dehydrated ones .",
    "we observed that the na nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/@xmath10 of the non - superconducting double - layer hydrate is of two order smaller than that of the parent na@xmath8coo@xmath3 but shows the similar temperature dependence .",
    "the electronic state on the coo@xmath3 planes of the non - superconducting double - layer hydrate is found to be nearly the same as that of the parent na@xmath8coo@xmath3 , i.e. the @xmath11-type spin fluctuations at low temperatures .",

    "the duration of the sample named blh1 was 1 week , and that of blh2 was 1 month .",
    "from the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility at an external magnetic field of 20 oe measured by a squid magnetometer , we estimated @xmath24 1.8 k and @xmath74.5 k for blh1 and blh2 , respectively .",
    "since the samples with short duration did not show superconductivity down to 1.8 k , blh1 is classified into these non - superconducting double - layer hydrates .",
    "zero - field @xmath25co nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) experiments were performed to characterize these samples .",
    "the appearance of an internal magnetic field below about 4.5 k was confirmed in a broad @xmath25co nqr spectrum of blh1 , which is similar to that of the material in the previous report @xcite .",

    "the difference in the magnitude of 1/@xmath10 can be ascribed to that in @xmath48 , whose ratio is estimated to be about 6.6 for blh1 and about 10.1 for blh2 below 10 k. thus , the spin dynamics in @xmath49 at the na site in the double - layer hydrates is similar to that in the non - hydrated na@xmath8coo@xmath3 .",
