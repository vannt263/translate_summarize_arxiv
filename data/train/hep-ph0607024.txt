    "the theoretical description of the @xmath3 -dependence of the structure function @xmath1 in perturbative qcd is mostly performed for the kinematic region of large @xmath3 . however , for the phenomenological analysis of the results of the compass collaboration one needs the possible knowledge of @xmath1 at small @xmath2 and small @xmath3 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "let us remind that the conventional standard approach ( sa ) based on combining the dglap evolution equations@xcite with phenomenological inputs for the initial parton densities@xcite , can not be used for description of @xmath1 in this region .",

    "such factors act as the leading singularities ( simple poles ) in the mellin transform of @xmath10 and provide @xmath1 with the regge asymptotics : @xmath11 when @xmath12 .    on the other hand , in our approach@xcite based on the total resummation of the leading @xmath13 terms in perturbative qcd ,",
    "the regge behaviour of @xmath1 at @xmath14 appears naturally , independent of the value of @xmath3 .",
    "indeed it results from the leading singularities of the anomalous dimensions and coefficient functions , which are branching points and not simple poles .",
    "the singularities of the anomalous dimensions and coefficient functions coincide .",
    "this is very important because it guarantees the independence of @xmath3 of the intercepts of @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore by fitting the experimental data in our approach one does not need ad hoc singular factors @xmath15 in the initial parton densities .",
    "the theoretical aspects of the power corrections to the dis structure functions were considered in refs .",

    "the interplay between the perturbative and non - perturbative corrections in the hard kinematics was recently considered in detail in ref  @xcite . in fitting experimental data in the small-@xmath2 region ,",
    "the discrepancies from the sa predictions are conventionally interpreted ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) as the ( non - perturbative ) higher twist power ( @xmath16 ) contributions .",
    "however as the small-@xmath2 region is beyond the reach of sa , the real size of the higher twist corrections can be erroneously overestimated .",
    "it is clear that systematic account of power corrections @xmath17 can be satisfactory only when using formulas that already account for the resummation of logarithmic contributions .",

    "our suggestion , based on the analysis of the feynman graphs for @xmath1 at small @xmath2 , is to replace @xmath3 by @xmath18 in our previous formulas , with @xmath19 being the infrared cut - off such a shift also leads to replacement the variable @xmath2 by@xmath20 .",

    "the expressions for @xmath1 enlisted in sect .  3 and proved in sect .",
    "4 account for the total resummation of leading logarithms of @xmath2 and @xmath3 when @xmath3 are large but they are also valid for small @xmath3 .",

    "the spin structure functions @xmath30 have the non - singlet , @xmath31 , and singlet , @xmath32 , components . in general , @xmath30 ( and all other dis structure functions ) acquire both perturbative and non - perturbative qcd contributions .    in the first place",

    "the other part , @xmath34 , of @xmath25 includes both perturbative and non - perturbative qcd contributions .",
    "the standard way to calculate the structure functions is using the factorization . according to it ,",
    "@xmath25 is regarded as a convolution @xmath35 of the partonic tensors @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 label the incoming parton , i.e. a quark or a gluon respectively ) and probabilities @xmath38 to find this parton ( quark or gluon ) in the incoming hadron .",
    "the probabilities @xmath38 include both perturbative and non - perturbative contributions whereas purely perturbative tensors @xmath39 describe their @xmath2- and @xmath3- evolutions .",

    "besides , there are the higher twists contributions @xmath49 .",
    "they can be interpreted either in terms of more involved convolution or as essentially non - perturbative objects .    in order to calculate @xmath50 ,",

    "one can use dglap . in dglap",

    "the ir singularities in the ladder rungs are not any longer regulated automatically , so an infrared cut - off should be introduced for integration over every loop momentum .",
    "it is the reason why the @xmath19 -dependence of @xmath1 is getting more involved at small @xmath2 .",
    "usually the cut - off is identified with @xmath19 , the starting point of the @xmath3 -evolution , though it is not mandatory .",
    "obviously , the value of @xmath19 should be large enough to justify using the perturbative qcd :    @xmath56    generally speaking , there are different ways to introduce infrared cut - offs but providing ir - divergent propagators with fictiones masses is most wide - spread .",
