    "quantum computation , attracting much current interest since shor s algorithm @xcite was proposed , depends on two key factors : quantum entanglement and precision control of quantum systems .",
    "unfortunately , quantum systems are inevitably coupled to their environment so that entanglement is too fragile to be retained .",
    "this makes the realization of quantum computation extremely difficult in the real world . in order to overcome this difficulty",
    ", one proposed the decoherence - free space concept @xcite .",
    "it is found that when qubits involved in quantum computation collectively interact with a same environment there exists a `` protected '' subspace in the entire hilbert space , in which the qubits are immune to the decoherence effects induced by the environment .",
    "this subspace is called decoherence - free space ( dfs ) . to perform quantum computation in a dfs",
    ", one has to design the specific hamiltonian containing controlling parameters , which eigenspace is spanned by dfs states and the state - unitary manipulation related to quantum computation goal is implemented by changing the controlling parameters @xcite .",
    "as well known , instantaneous eigenstates of a quantum system with the time - dependent hamiltonian may acquire a geometric phase when the time - dependent parameters adiabatically undergo a closed loop in the parameter space @xcite .",
    "the phase depends only on the swept solid angle by the parameter vector in the parameter space .",
    "this feature can be utilized to implement geometric quantum computation ( gqc ) which is resilient to stochastic control errors @xcite .",
    "on combining the dfs approach with the gqc scheme , one may build quantum gates which may be immune to both the environment - induced decoherence effects and the control - led errors @xcite . in the scheme ,",
    "quantum logical bits are represented by degenerate eigenstates of the parameterized hamiltonian .",
    "these states have the features : they belong to dfs , and unitarily evolve in time and acquire a geometric phase when the controlling parameters adiabatically vary and undergo a closed loop .    in the recent paper @xcite , carollo and coworkers showed that a cascade three - level atom interacting with a broadband squeezed vacuum bosonic bath can be prepared in a state which is decoupled to the environment .",
    "this state depends on the reservoir parameters such as squeezing degree and phase angle .",
    "as the squeezing parameters smoothly vary , the atomic state can unitarily evolve in time and always be in the manifold of the dfs .",
    "moreover , after a cyclic evolution of the squeezing parameters , the state acquires a geometric phase . this investigation has been generalized to cases where both quantum systems and manipulated reservoir under consideration are not restricted to cascade three - level atoms and squeezed vacuum @xcite .",
    "these results strongly inspire us that instead of engineering hamiltonian one may implement the decoherence - free gqc by engineering and manipulating reservoir .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme in which the quantum - reservoir engineering @xcite is combined with dfs and berry phase together to realize a two - qubit cphase gate @xcite .",
    "we show that atomic states can unitarily evolve in time in a dfs if the change rate of reservoir parameters is much smaller than the characteristic relaxation time of an atom - reservoir coupled system .",
    "moreover , we find that as the reservoir parameters adiabatically change in time along an appropriate closed loop , the atomic state in the dfs acquires a berry phase and a cphase gate with arbitrary phase shift can be realized . to our knowledge , it is the first proposal for the realization of quantum gates by engineering and steering the environment .",
