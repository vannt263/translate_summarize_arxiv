    "but , these calibrations do not take into account age dependence , probably due to the difficulty of deriving ages for rc stars . in view of this situation ,",

    "moreover , one may ask how the calibrations of rr lyrae and rc stars are connected at a fixed metallicity in between . in this respect",
    ", rhb stars may be important for establishing the calibrations for the mild metallicity population because they are significantly populated in the color - magnitude diagrams ( hereafter cmds ) of mild metal poor globular clusters .    in this work",
    ", we aim to determine absolute magnitudes for rhb stars based on the photometric data of 17 globular clusters and three open clusters in the @xmath1 system presented in an et al .",
    "the main goals of this study are as follows .",
    "first , the calibrations of absolute magnitude can be established in the @xmath1 system and they are useful in distance determinations of interesting populations based on the large database of the sdss photometric survey .",
    "moreover , wavelength coverage of @xmath1 filters are narrower than those of johnson @xmath11 and @xmath10 filters , and thus they provide more accurate magnitudes of rhb stars .",
    "second , it is possible to investigate which filter , among the five @xmath1 filters , is the best distance indicator and how the absolute magnitude varies with metallicity and age .",
    "finally , it is interesting to compare these calibrations and decide which calibration , in which filter , is the best for a particular population .",
    "should we use different calibrations for a different metallicity range ?",
    "will the nonlinear calibrations with metallicity improve the precision of absolute magnitude determination ?",
    "is it necessary to include the age term in the calibrations ?",
    "how are these calibrations adopted in different cases ?",
    "the photometric data of 17 galactic globular clusters and three open clusters in the sdss @xmath1 system are taken from an et al .",
    "( 2008 ) who applied the daophot / allframe programs to the central parts of clusters .",
    "these programs can provide more reliable @xmath1 photometric data for crowded cluster fields than those of the standard sdss pipeline .",
    "the selection of rhb stars in each cluster is based on the following procedures . as described in an et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , some clusters are observed more than one time and there are some overlapping regions between different observation runs . in view of this , the first step is to identify common stars in different observation runs and to provide a clear sample so that the same star observed for more than one time will not be considered as two or more stars . in the present work , stars with the same positions , i.e. both @xmath18 and @xmath19 being less than 0.5 arcsec , and the same colors , i.e. @xmath20 being less than 0.2 mag , in different observation runs are considered to be the same object and we include only one of them in the final sample .",
    "then , we select stars within the tidal radius of the cluster and plot the cmd in different filters based on the reddening taken from harris ( 1996 ) , 2003 february version , which is presented in table 1 of an et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . in the whole paper ,",
    "the colors and magnitudes that we presented are reddening - corrected parameters",
    ".    among the 20 clusters , eight globular clusters and one open cluster ( presented in table 1 ) show clear clumping of rhb stars .",
    "the nine clusters cover the metallicity range of @xmath21 } } < + 0.4 $ ] and the age range of 8 - 12 gyr .",
    "the ages of the clusters are taken from salaris & weiss ( 2002 ) .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , the ages of five clusters increase with decreasing metallicity ( they are classified as group 1 ) while four clusters ( pal 3,4,5,14 ) are significantly younger for their metallicity at @xmath12}}\\sim -1.5 $ ] ( they are classified as group 2 ) .",
    "it is emphasized that clusters in group 2 are important , which makes it possible to investigate the age effect on the absolute magnitude in the present work .",
    "the two groups of clusters will be considered separately in the following analysis when necessary .",
    "usually , rhb stars in the cmd of each cluster , shown in figure 2 , are well separated from bhb stars , due to the presence of a gap in between , and from rgb stars , due to their low metallicity and/or old age .",
    "but we should keep in mind that the so - called rhb stars in this paper may include some rr lyrae stars and even redder rc stars in clusters because we do not have suitable data or criteria to exclude them .",
    "fortunately , it is expected that they will not affect the result of this paper in regards to statistics due to the small number and similar magnitudes in the hb of clusters .",
    "the distributions of rhb stars are slightly different in the cmds based on different colors and filters in the @xmath1 system .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , the -@xmath0 diagram of m5 is the best diagram to pick out rhb stars ( within the defined box ) in the sense that the gap between the bhb and rhb populations is clear and the rhb population is quite flat as  varies .",
    "the rhb population is also clear in the -@xmath22 diagram .",
    "however , it is difficult to pick out rhb stars based on the -@xmath23 and -@xmath0 diagrams because  is a significantly metallicity - sensitive index , and rhb and bhb populations have the overlapping  colors at 1.0 - 1.2 mag .",
    "also , it is not easy to define the rhb population from the -@xmath24 and the -@xmath25 diagrams because the gaps between rhb and bhb / rgb are not so clear .",
    "moreover , the photometric precisions of @xmath0 and @xmath22 filters are generally higher than those of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 filters in the sdss survey .",
    "therefore , the -@xmath0 diagram has the advantage of picking out rhb stars from these clusters .    in order to define the colors and magnitude ranges of rhb stars in the -@xmath0 diagram",
    ", we adopt a critical radius ( @xmath26 in table 1 ) for each cluster , within which stars are selected to be plotted in the cmd .",
    "the exception is pal 4 , for which we select all stars presented in the an et al .",
    "( 2008 ) paper without using any critical radius because there are not enough stars even within the tidal radius .",
    "the half diameter from van den bergh ( 2006 ) is adopted to be the critical radius for open cluster ngc6791 . for the remaining clusters ,",
    "a critical radius between half light radius and tidal radius is chosen so that the rhb population in the cmd will become more clear .",
    "then , we can define colors and magnitude ranges of rhb stars for clusters by eye .",
    "as we show later , the resulting absolute magnitudes will not be affected by the exact edges of the defined colors and magnitudes of rhb populations .",
