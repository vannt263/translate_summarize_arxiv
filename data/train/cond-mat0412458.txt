    "the refinement of lithographic and other fabrication techniques used in photonic crystal ( pc ) development has generated a broad range of experimental , and theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ability of pc structures to control the propagation of electromagnetic fields has stimulated certain emerging concepts and devices that are based on pc technology , including microscopic lasers , optical switches , light localization , and resonant cavity antennas @xcite .",
    "it is computationally convenient when investigating pc structures , to assume the pc is of infinite extent .",
    "this means a perfect crystal , or a crystal with defects in a supercell configuration , and this works well for band structure calculations .",
    "this approximation has limitations , since experimental situations involving finite - sized crystals may involve defect modes that result from truncating the infinite periodicity , or reflections and interference effects of the fields around the boundaries @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of theoretical studies also assume the pc consists of linear material .",
    "when characterizing the electromagnetic properties of pc structures , the transmittance characteristics often yield limited information regarding the band gap , owing mainly to the directional dependence of the incident field @xcite .",
    "the quantity of experimental relevance , that affords a more complete and fundamental picture of the spectra and modes of the system , is the spatially and energy resolved local density of states ( ldos).@xcite    in this paper , we compute ldos and field characteristics for a finite two - dimensional pc consisting of both linear and nonlinear material .",
    "some researchers @xcite have focused on surface modes associated with a one - dimensional pc .",
    "our emphasis is on the properties of surface resonant modes as a localized field to concentrate the electric field in the presence of nlm . for the case of two - dimensional truncated structures consisting of an array of cylinders , surface",
    "electromagnetic waves can be supported .",
    "these surface modes are localized near the truncation boundary and propagate parallel to the interface . since the intensity of the surface modes is concentrated at the interface , and",
    "if the interface contains nonlinear material ( nlm ) , then a more efficient frequency conversion might be achieved .",
    "this could be useful in frequency conversion devices for use in detectors to operate between visible and infrared wavelengths .    in sec.[theory ]",
    ", we outline the integral formulation of the problem .",
    "next , we briefly discuss the iterative numerical algorithm used to calculate the electromagnetic fields and green s function , which gives essential information regarding the ldos",
    ". the ldos will help reveal certain defect modes of the pc that occur at frequencies within a band gap .",
    "we present the results in sec.[results ] and find that within the pc structure , the ldos is small but nonzero within the band gap , and that any localized states reside mainly within the truncated surface .",
    "results are also shown that illustrate the effect of incorporating nlm material .",
    "we calculate the ldos of a finite size 2d pc for the cases where the dielectric material is all linear or some rods are nonlinear .",

    "of particular interest are localized surface wave modes along a pc interface . to model the 2d pc , we consider a finite - sized square array of dielectric cylinders as shown in fig .",
