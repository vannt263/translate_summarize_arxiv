    "in recent years the cobe dmr ( @xcite ) , firs ( @xcite ) and tenerife ( @xcite ) experiments have successfully detected anisotropy at large angular scales yielding precise estimations of the overall normalization of the power spectrum ( @xcite ) and its shape at low multipole moments @xmath10 . at smaller angular scales ( @xmath11 )",
    "a wealth of experiments have reported detections of anisotropy ( for an up - to - date list of experimental results see tegmark s web site : http://www.sns.ias.edu/@xmath12max/cmb/experiments.html ) .",
    "these detections clearly suggest a increase in the power spectrum at @xmath13 ( @xcite,@xcite ) and its decline at @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main aim of our experiment ( for preliminary results see @xcite ) is to fill the gap in @xmath15-space remaining between the two @xmath15-space regions described above .",
    "thus , with our observing strategy we are probing the multipole bands at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , in between the tenerife experiment at @xmath18 ( @xcite ) and the acme south pole at @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the choice of the observing frequencies also distinguishes this experiment from other ground - based experiments .",
    "it is known that the combined contributions from galactic foregrounds and discrete radio sources reaches its minimum at about 55 ghz .",
    "however , the presence of a strong @xmath20 absorption line in the range 50 - 70 ghz , and the increasing atmospheric emission at millimetric wavelengths hamper observations at these frequencies forces ground - based experiments to observe at cm wavelengths where contamination from synchrotron and free - free emission are of concern . thus , the millimetric range has been traditionally exploited by satellite and balloon experiments , and only very few ground - based experiments have observed at these frequencies ( python ( @xcite ) , suzie ( @xcite ) and @xcite ) .    in section  [ instrument ]",
    "we briefly describe the instrument and concentrate on the measurement technique . in section  [ observations ]",
    "we give the details of the observations .",
    "atmospheric effects in our data are described in section  [ atmosphere ] .",
    "the details of the atmospheric noise reduction technique and the resulting final data sets are presented in section  [ technique ] . in section  [ foregrounds ]",
    "we conclude that at high @xmath21 the only expected signal is the cmb .",
    "section  [ statistics ] describes the statistical data , and conclusions are presented in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the instrument has been described in detail in previous work ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the optics forms an off - axis gregorian telescope with a parabolic primary mirror ( 45 cm diameter ) and a hyperbolic secondary mirror ( 28 cm diameter ) .",
    "the detector is a four - channel photometer equipped with @xmath22he bolometers working at 0.33k .",
    "the bands peak at 3.3 , 2.1 , 1.3 and 1.1 mm wavelengths ( channels 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 respectively ) .",
    "the beam response for all channels can be well approximated by a gaussian with fwhm=@xmath23 and no significant sidelobes are found .",
    "in addition to the optics , the response of the instrument to a point - like source depends on the observing strategy and demodulation of the data ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observing strategy consists in daily drift scans at constant declination achieved by fixing the telescope in azimuth ( @xmath24 ) and elevation ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "additionally the beam moves on the sky as the primary mirror wobbles sinusoidally while the secondary is fixed .",
    "the right ascension ( @xmath26 ) and declination ( @xmath27 ) at which the antenna is pointing at time @xmath28 are given in a good approximation by : @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the initial position of the antenna , @xmath32 is the zero - to - peak chopping amplitude at a reference frequency @xmath33 hz and @xmath34 is an irrelevant phase constant .",
    "each bolometer s output is sampled at @xmath35 hz coherently with the mirror movement so to have 20 samples per mirror oscillation .",
    "the signal is demodulated in software by evaluating the amplitude of the first ( 4 hz ) and second ( 8 hz ) harmonic of the reference frequency @xmath36 .",
    "each demodulation ( 1f and 2f for the first and second harmonic respectively ) can be divided in two components : the in - phase component containing mostly the sky - signal coherent with the reference motion plus the instrument noise and the out - phase containing mostly the instrument noise plus other sources of systematic noise .",
    "such division requires a careful choice of phase which was obtained from observation of the moon transiting the instrument beam .",
    "then the mapping function at a sky location of coordinates @xmath37 when the antenna is pointing towards @xmath38 is computed as ( @xcite ) :    @xmath39\\ ] ]    for @xmath40 indicating respectively the 1f and 2f demodulation , @xmath41 , @xmath42 is a phase constant , @xmath43 is the angular distance between the point of coordinates @xmath37 and the center of the beam at time @xmath28 and @xmath44 is a normalization constant for the @xmath45 demodulation obtained by requiring an output of @xmath46  k when the input is an extended source of @xmath46  k filling the positive lobe .",
    "the response of the 1f and 2f demodulations resembles the usual 2-beam and 3-beam responses to the transit of a point - like source through the beam .",
    "the 1f demodulated data are well fitted by a 2-beam response with asymmetric gaussians with @xmath47 in the ra direction and @xmath48 in the declination direction , and with a beam throw of @xmath49 .",
    "the 2f demodulated data are fitted by a 3-beam response with @xmath50 , @xmath51 for the positive lobe , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 for the negative lobes and a beam throw of @xmath54 .",
    "additionally , these fits must be multiplied by the factors @xmath55 and @xmath56 to yield the normalizations to the actual response functions for 1f and 2f respectively .",
    "these approximations greatly simplify the statistical analyses as discussed in section  [ statistics ] .",
    "the response of the instrument to different angular scales ( represented in terms of the corresponding multipole moment @xmath15 ) is completely specified by the window function . for a constant declination observation",
    "the window function for the product of two temperatures separated by an angle @xmath57 is computed according to @xcite to give :    @xmath58 ^ 2 } \\ , j^{2}_{n}[(\\ell - 2r ) \\beta_{0 } ] \\ , \\cos[(\\ell-2r)\\psi ] \\ , j^{2}_{0}\\left[\\frac{(\\ell-2r ) \\delta \\phi}{2}\\right]\\ ] ]    where @xmath59 refers to the beam profile : @xmath60 $ ] , @xmath61 is the n - th order bessel function of the first kind , @xmath62 is the zeroth - order spherical bessel function and @xmath63 is the bin size in radians on the sky . in figure  [ fig_window ]",
    "we show the window functions for @xmath64 and @xmath65  min in ra , corresponding to the @xmath15-ranges @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the central value corresponds to the band power average and the upper and lower limits give the @xmath15 ranges where @xmath68 has amplitudes larger than @xmath69 times its peak .",
    "laboratory calibrations were performed by placing blackbody radiators at different temperatures in front of the optical window . by means of an off - axis mirror the optics within the cryostat",
    "is redirected towards a vessel containing eccosorb and divided in four sections .",
    "two sections were filled with liquid nitrogen alternately placed between the other two sections which were filled with liquid oxygen .",
    "a measurement of the pressure at which these two liquids evaporate gives a precise measurement of the temperature .",
    "then the container is rotated at 2 revolutions per second so the detectors see two black bodies of known temperatures .",
    "the calibration factors thus obtained have uncertainties ranging from 1.5% ( channel 1 ) up to 7.6% ( channel 4 ) . since we are concerned with the possibility of systematic effects in the calibration process we quote a laboratory calibration uncertainty based on our observations of the moon ( see below ) .",
    "our observations were conducted during june and july 1994 , collecting about 550 hours of data , at observatorio del teide at tenerife ( spain ) .",
    "the site , at an altitude of 2400 m and latitude n @xmath70 , is well known among the solar community for its good seeing and the large percentage of clear days , the latter due to the fact that the inversion layer lies below the observatory for about 75 % of the time .",
    "this is also the location of the tenerife experiment ( @xcite ) which has already demonstrated the potential of the site for hosting observations in the cm range due to the stability of the atmosphere and its excellent transparency ( @xcite ) .",
    "these features makes of this site a promising place for mm observations .",
    "the observations concentrated at declination @xmath71 by pointing the antenna towards the north meridian and at an elevation angle of @xmath72 . this declination has been extensively measured from this site at larger angular scales(@xmath73 ) and lower frequencies ( 10 , 15 and 33 ghz ) with reported detections of structures in the cmb by the jodrell bank - iac experiments ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "the measurements started after the sun was well below the horizon in order to avoid solar contamination .",
    "the angular distance between moon and beam was always greater than @xmath74 for the @xmath71 observations .",
    "in addition the moon was observed for astronomical calibration .",
    "the values obtained from the analysis of the moon transits in the 1f demodulation agree within @xmath75 of the laboratory calibrations for all channels ( see figure  [ fig_moon ] ) .",
    "the bulk of the calibration uncertainty ( 6  % , 26  % , 22  % and 10  % for channels 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 respectively ) we believe is due to the lunar models used ( @xcite ) . by fitting the observed moon transit to the expected transits at both demodulations , and modeling the moon as an extended uniform disk and the beam as gaussian shaped , we obtain estimates for the beam width , @xmath76 , and chopping amplitude , @xmath77 , given in table  [ tab_fits_moon ] . since the moon transit is better defined in the 1f data we adopt the estimates for @xmath76 and @xmath77 from the 1f demodulation .",
    "the values for @xmath77 from the fits to each channel are consistent with each other , yielding an average value of @xmath78 . as expected , the beam widths seen by each channel show a monotonic decrease with frequency so that channel 1 has the widest beam and channel 4 the narrowest beam .",
    "even so , given the sizes of the error bars assigned to each width , all of them are consistent with a unique beam width given by the weighted average : @xmath79 . in any case , for calibration purposes we adopted for each channel the best fit value obtained for that channel .",
    "it is worth mentioning the agreement between the fwhm estimated for channel 1 in the lab ( @xmath80 ) with that from the fit to the moon transit ( @xmath81 from the 1f moon transit and @xmath82 from the 2f moon transit ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the values of @xmath77 measured in the lab and from the moon transit can only be attributed to the antenna assembling , and throughout this work we have assumed the value of @xmath77 as obtained from the moon transit analysis .",
    "the biggest source of noise for cmb ground observations at millimetric wavelengths comes from atmospheric emissions dominated by fluctuations of @xmath20 and water vapor contents . given the stability of the pressure during the campaign , the most important parameter turned out to be the precipitable water vapor .",
    "the meteorological conditions during the campaign are summarized in figure  [ fig_weather ] .",
    "the pressure and temperature are measured at the observatory four times a day .",
    "the relative humidity is also measured at the observatory every few minutes .",
    "the precipitable water vapor is obtained from the measurements of the balloons launched twice a day by the spanish meteorological institute from sea level . in our case ,",
    "the precipitable water vapor is obtained by integrating the balloon measurements from the observatory level up to @xmath83 km .      atmospheric effects in our data become evident as a big increase with respect to the expected instrument noise levels . in the ideal case (",
    "i.e. the instrument noise is white ) we should observe flat power spectra if our data were entirely due to instrumental noise .",
    "however our data are a combination of instrument noise , atmospheric noise and astronomical signal , the latter to be ignored given its weakness in each night of observation . at low frequencies neither the instrument noise nor the atmospheric noise exhibit flat spectra .",
    "bolometers show a characteristic @xmath84 spectrum while atmospheric fluctuations have a more complicated spectrum and in general follow a @xmath85 spectrum with @xmath86 variable . on the other hand ,",
    "both spectra flatten at high frequencies , becoming indistinguishable from each other . at high frequencies",
    "the power spectra are flat , and assigning to the instrument noise the value corresponding to such noise floor is a huge overestimation .    in theory , this problem could be solved by using the out - phase component produced during the demodulation because it is expected to contain only instrumental noise . in practice , even in the out - phase component there are still residual amounts of atmospheric noise because it is impossible to find a constant demodulation phase which completely sets to zero the sky - signal in the out - phase component . in figure  [ fig_ps1 ]",
    "we show the noise spectra in thermodynamic temperature for all channels and both demodulations of the in- and out - phase components for a typical night of observation .",
    "channel 1 exhibits power spectra almost flat in the out - phase spectra for 1f and 2f demodulations , indicating that most of the noise in channel 1 at high frequencies is due to instrument noise .",
    "the out - phase components for the rest of the channels still contains considerable amounts of atmospheric noise as indicated by the similar shapes of the spectra in the in- and out - phase components .",
    "this interpretation is strongly supported by the fact that the spectral shape at low frequencies , and the noise floor at high frequencies , change from day to day .",
    "the higher values for the instrumental noise as obtained from the analysis of the out - phase components of the the 1f data indicate the greater ability of the 2f demodulation in removing linear gradients caused by atmospheric emission .",
    "the final upper limits in thermodynamic units assigned to the instrument noise are 2.8 , 0.8 , 1.5 and 1.0 mk  s@xmath87 for channels 1 to 4 as obtained from the analysis of the out - phase components of the 2f demodulation . in figure  [ fig_histo1 ]",
    "we show the distribution of the @xmath88 values , calculated over 30 minute intervals , with 10 second bins for all channels and both demodulations . at 10 seconds",
    "the contribution from instrument noise to the @xmath88 would be less than 1mk for all channels , so most of the noise must be atmospheric .",
    "the noise level and the width of its distribution are larger in the 1f demodulation .",
    "additionally , the minimum values obtained in the 2f data are smaller ; another indication of the enhanced ability of the 2f demodulation to reduce atmospheric noise .      the second relevant effect due to atmospheric contamination concerns correlation between different channels .",
    "this is evident from the highly correlated time - variable signals seen by all channels for the same night of observation .",
    "this point will be used subsequently on as the cornerstone for our analysis to reduce atmospheric noise in the data . in table",
    "[ tab_correlations1 ] we present the mean correlation between channel @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) and channel 4 for the whole campaign and for the data selected to build the final data sets .",
    "as expected this correlation increases when increasing the frequency of channel @xmath89 and it is higher in the 1f data than in the 2f data .",
    "another effect is the auto - correlation introduced by atmospheric noise .",
    "primary evidence of this effect is that the @xmath88 of the data do not follow the @xmath91 law when the data are binned .",
    "we have computed the auto - correlation function for the data within the same night of observation as seen by each channel at both demodulations .",
    "this was done by using the power spectra of the in - phase components and the wiener - khinchin relations ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as noticed when computing the instrument noise limits , the in - phase component power spectra show a large departure from white noise , implying non - zero auto - correlations at lags different from zero .",
    "the average auto - correlation function for the whole campaign and for all channels and both demodulations is shown in figure  [ fig_auto - correlation ] . for a given lag",
    "we observe that the auto - correlation function is always larger in the high frequency channels .",
    "the coherence time is always larger for the 1f data than for the 2f data .",
    "this reflects the higher efficiency with which a double - switching technique is able to discard the effects of linear temporal drifts due to atmospheric emission . from figure  [ fig_auto - correlation ]",
    "we conclude that it is necessary to use bins large enough such that correlation between adjacent bins is reduced ( see section  [ technique ] ) .",
    "this will ensure that the standard deviations are properly computed and assigned as error bars when moving to larger bin sizes .",
    "the demodulation process produces a data point every 0.25 s per each 1f and 2f demodulation and per channel . during the demodulation 3.3% of the data",
    "was rejected due to problems of synchronism between the mirror movement and the data acquisition system .",
    "the bulk of the data rejection was performed during the subsequent phases of binning and editing comprising the data processing .",
    "after demodulation a binning is performed to bring the data from 0.25 s to 10 s. this is a trade - off between the need to reduce correlation between adjacent bins ( auto - correlation @xmath92 for all channels at 1f demodulation and @xmath93 for all channels at 2f demodulation ) and to have a large enough number of points for the linear fits and further binning processes involved in the cleaning technique . during the 0.25 s to 10 s binning an iterative 3@xmath76 filter is applied three times to discard glitches due to malfunctions of the data acquisition system .",
    "bins of 10 s built with 15 or less points at 0.25 s are also discarded . in total , the amount of data rejected in this binning is about 8% for all channels and both demodulations .    as explained in the section  [ atmosphere ] , the extremely large temporal correlation between all channels and the amplitudes and behavior of the noise levels with the bin size strongly support the atmospheric origin of the bulk of the noise in our data .",
    "hence , the primary goal of any data reduction concerns the assessment and subtraction / reduction of this unwanted source of noise .",
    "the approach adopted in this work consists in exploiting the high correlation between channels as an indicator of the atmospheric emission , so that by using a channel as a monitor we can clean the rest of the channels . since channel 4 ( 1.1 mm band ) is the most sensitive to atmospheric emission , we adopt it as the monitor .",
    "the method assumes that at each channel @xmath89 we have a superposition of astronomical signal attenuated by @xmath94 due to the atmospheric transparency , plus the contribution from the atmospheric emission .",
    "when expressing all quantities in antenna temperature we have at channel @xmath89 : @xmath95 .",
    "we assume that the atmospheric contributions are perfectly correlated between different channels so : @xmath96 .",
    "this assumption is strongly justified given the high correlation between data at different channels taken during the same night of observation ( see table  [ tab_correlations1 ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of the signals are too high to be attributed to cmb signal or other astronomical signal ( see section  [ foregrounds ] ) giving additional support to the above assumption . to recover the astronomical signal at channel @xmath89 in thermodynamic temperature ( @xmath97 ) and referred to the top of the atmosphere we solve the linear equation :    @xmath98    where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the recorded antenna temperatures at channels @xmath89 and 4 respectively ; @xmath94 and @xmath101 the atmospheric attenuation factors ; @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the rayleigh - jeans to thermodynamic conversion factors:@xmath104 ( @xmath105 = 1.29 , 1.66 , 3.66 , 4.82 for channels 1 to 4 respectively ) and @xmath106 is the fraction of the astronomical signals seen at channels i and 4 . the second term within the parenthesis accounts for common structure in channels @xmath89 and 4 , though with different amplitudes . based on our estimations of non - cmb contaminants , at high galactic latitude ( high @xmath21 )",
    "we expect no astronomical signal other than the cmb itself ( see section  [ foregrounds ] ) so @xmath107 . at low @xmath21 and in the galactic plane",
    "we expect different signals in shape and in amplitude as seen by different channels .",
    "this motivates the introduction of @xmath108 , whose value is obtained from our estimations of the galactic diffuse emission .    the atmospheric cleaning technique is applied to the 10s - binned data after subtraction of a constant offset from each channel .",
    "the rejected data typically correspond to sections taken during bad weather and/or warming of the cryostat .",
    "the data are divided into segments of 5 minutes . for each of these segments",
    "we compute the values of @xmath109 from a linear fit of channel @xmath89 versus channel 4 .",
    "likewise , all points within the same 5 minute segment share the same @xmath94 and @xmath101 as computed from the splined values of water vapor w ,",
    "pressure p and temperature t from figure  [ fig_weather ] used as input to the code by @xcite , which computes the atmospheric opacities due to water vapor and oxygen using the us standard atmosphere model .",
    "after cleaning , a new binning is performed to bring each processed night of observation from a 10 second to a 4 minute bin size so the beam is sampled with at least 3 points .",
    "once again a 3@xmath76 filter is applied to discard possible glitches occurred during the cleaning process .",
    "to each point at 4 minutes we assign an error bar given by the standard deviation of the mean of all points at 10s within the bin at 4 minutes . a similar analysis to that performed in section  [ atmosphere].2 allows us to obtain the mean auto - correlation function for the processed data in each channel and both demodulations .",
    "this analysis shows that for points separated by 4 minutes the auto - correlation functions for all channels 1 to 3 and both demodulations range between 9% ( ch 2 1f ) and 1% ( ch 1 2f ) .",
    "therefore , our 4 minute bins can be considered uncorrelated as well as their error bars . in both demodulations and in all channels we observe residual baselines of very long periods .",
    "we proceed to remove these remnants by fitting linear combinations of sinusoidal functions after a re - edit of the data .",
    "the re - edit discards noisy sections which may affect the fitting process .",
    "the minimum period of the sinusoidal functions is chosen to be large enough so to remove signals corresponding to angular scales bigger than the ones to which the instrument is sensitive .",
    "thus , for the 1f data the minimum period is @xmath110 in ra and a minimum period of @xmath111 in ra for the 2f data . in figure  [ fig_process ]",
    "we display these various stages of the cleaning technique for a typical night as seen in all channels and both demodulations . in the last column of table  [ tab_final_data_1 ]",
    "we give the mean amplitude of the baseline fits .",
    "columns 1 and 2 show the percentage of total data used with respect to the original data at 0.25 s and the number of nights used to generate the final data sets . the percentage of data used is bigger in the 2f data as well as the number of used nights , with the exception of channel 3 .",
    "the final data sets were obtained by stacking all individual baseline - cleaned nights where the @xmath88 did not exceed 0.65 , 1.3 and 2.5 mk for channels 1 , 2 and 3 respectively in the 1f demodulation and 0.4 , 0.4 and 2.0 mk for channels 1 , 2 and 3 respectively in the 2f demodulation .",
    "column 3 in table  [ tab_final_data_1 ] gives the mean @xmath88 for the surviving nights once residual baselines have been removed .",
    "the stacking process consists of computing weighted averages , where to the @xmath89th bin in the final data set we assign a value and error bar given by :    @xmath112    @xmath113    where the indices @xmath114 refer to bin @xmath89 in night @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the data point and standard deviation at bin @xmath89 in night @xmath115 , and @xmath118 is the number of nights used for this @xmath89th bin in the final data set .",
    "the final data sets in the regions before and after the galactic plane crossing are shown in figure  [ fig_final_sets ] .",
    "the efficiency of the atmospheric reduction process is best demonstrated by looking at the power spectra of the data before and after its application . in figure  [ fig_ps2 ]",
    "we show the power spectra of both demodulations and for channels 1 , 2 and 3 for a typical night before and after cleaning .",
    "this figure corresponds to the same data as in figure  [ fig_ps1 ] .",
    "the reduction in the noise level is evident from these plots , so that the corrected ch 1 and ch 2 in both demodulations approach the levels expected from instrument noise .",
    "we also notice the flattening , approaching the ideal behavior of white noise . for channel 3",
    "there is also an overall decrement in the power spectra of both demodulations indicating that a substantial fraction of the atmospheric noise has been subtracted .",
    "however , the levels of the cleaned data for channel 3 still show residual atmospheric contamination . in table  [ tab_ps ] we give the values attained by the noise spectrum in the in - phase components at different frequencies and for both demodulations before and after cleaning for the same observing night as in figure  [ fig_ps2 ] .",
    "the corresponding values are also given for the out - phase component spectra . at low frequencies ( i.e 0.001 hz ) where atmospheric effects are more evident the cleaned file exhibits lower values of the noise spectra than before cleaning ; a good indication that most of the atmospheric noise has been removed .",
    "further , this value approaches the values attained in the out - phase components containing small amounts of atmospheric noise due to the leakage during the demodulation .",
    "another indication of the performance of the technique is given in figure  [ fig_histo2 ] where we show the distribution of the @xmath88 values measured in the 10 second binned data after applying our cleaning method .",
    "once again the last bin exhibits a high value since it also contains the contributions from all following bins to avoid a huge spread in the plots .",
    "when we compare this figure with figure  [ fig_histo1 ] we notice a huge decrement of the @xmath88 for all channels and both demodulations .",
    "another check of the performance is the recovery of the galactic plane ( gp ) crossing .",
    "the introduction of a factor @xmath119 to recover the gp explicitly assumes perfect correlation of this signal as seen by channel @xmath89 and channel 4 .",
    "this is a very good approximation for channels 2 , 3 and 4 where the bulk of the galactic emission is due to dust emission .",
    "the estimated gp crossings in channel 2 1f demodulation ( 2f demodulation ) is 99% ( 96% ) correlated with channel 4 , while the estimation of the gp in channel 3 1f demodulation ( 2f demodulation ) attains a 100% ( 100% ) correlation with respect to the gp seen by channel 4 . for channel 1",
    "the contributions from dust and free - free emission are comparable , the latter slightly more important .",
    "furthermore , the free - free template ( 1420 mhz map ) and the dust template ( 240 @xmath120 m dirbe map ) show a relative slight displacement in the position of the gp at @xmath121 , thus lowering the correlation between channel 1 and channel 4 down to 93% and 72% for the 1f and 2f data respectively . in figure  [ fig_gp1 ]",
    "we show the predicted galactic plane crossings superimposed on our measurements for channels 1 , 2 and 3 and both 1f and 2f demodulations . as discussed in section  [ foregrounds ] , we have considered the dust model in @xcite , with the @xmath106 factors listed in table  [ tab_gp1 ] .",
    "we have also tried several different galactic emission models in the literature and have checked that , while the absolute amplitudes in each channel depend strongly on the model used , their ratios are quite stable and so is the parameter @xmath106 as can be seen in table  [ tab_gp1 ] .",
    "the slight differences between the @xmath106 factors for the 1f and 2f demodulations are not relevant , except for channel 1 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the above mentioned displacements between the contributions generating the gp in channel 1 . using @xmath122 in equation  ( [ eq_main ] ) instead of @xmath106 results in an amplification / attenuation of the restored gp given by :    @xmath123",
    "the extreme values of @xmath124 obtained when using the @xmath106 values obtained from the models described in table  [ tab_foregrounds ] are 0.6 and 1.2 .",
    "therefore we do not expect big changes in the amplitude of the restored gp due to the change of dust model used to estimate the values of the @xmath106 factors .",
    "the general agreement between the predictions and our measurements constitutes an important check on the performance of our system and method .",
    "the galactic contribution has been analyzed considering the synchrotron , free - free and dust emission . when studying the synchrotron emission it is convenient to distinguish between the expected levels of signal at low galactic latitudes ( i.e at @xmath125 or gp crossings ) and at high galactic latitudes ( i.e at @xmath126 or outside the gp ) .",
    "as studied by @xcite , outside the gp and at our angular scales and frequencies , the contributions from the galactic synchrotron and free - free emission are expected not to be a source of confusion with cmb anisotropy .",
    "we have also conducted a study of the expected levels of contamination by synchrotron and free - free emission in our data by convolving our instrumental response with a template of synchrotron and free - free processes .",
    "this template was obtained by extrapolating in frequency from the low frequency map at 1420 mhz ( @xcite ) , and modeling both processes with a single power - law : @xmath127 .",
    "the spectral index @xmath128 is obtained by fitting this law to the low frequency maps at 408 mhz ( @xcite ) and at 1420 mhz .",
    "the results of such an analysis predict that free - free plus synchrotron would contribute to the observed @xmath88 with values smaller than 1  @xmath120k for both demodulations and in all channels . additionally , assuming the extremely conservative approach that the signal seen at 33 ghz by the tenerife experiment is entirely synchrotron emission , and extrapolating with @xmath129",
    ", we obtain that for all channels the synchrotron emission at high @xmath21 amounts for less than 1@xmath130 in both 1f and 2f data .",
    "these two independent approaches clearly indicate the negligible effect of synchrotron and free - free emission on our data at high @xmath21 .    in the gp region the map at 1420 mhz is dominated by free - free emission due to the presence of the cygnus x hii region and many other unresolved hii regions ( @xcite ) . accordingly , when generating the template for this region we assumed a spectral index of @xmath131 as obtained from equation ( 3 ) of @xcite . to generate the template in this region we also considered the possibility of still having non - negligible contributions of synchrotron emission in the 1420 mhz map as indicated by the spectral indexes required to reproduce the gp s seen by dmr at 31.5 , 53 and 90 ghz .",
    "we have used the dirbe map at 240 @xmath132 as template for the dust emission and extrapolated to our frequencies by using the fit to the firas data obtained by @xcite resulting in a model with @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "we have checked the validity of this model at low @xmath21 by reproducing the expected dust contribution to the gp seen by cobe dmr at 90 ghz where the relevant section has been smoothed to 10  fwhm . together with a brief description and reference to the dust model used , in table  [ tab_foregrounds ] we give the @xmath88 values expected from synchrotron plus free - free and dust emission for different dust models outside the gp ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "these @xmath88 values are completely negligible as compared to the observed @xmath88 values in our final data sets ( see section  [ statistics ] ) .",
    "this can also be seen by using the figure of @xmath136 at 53 ghz and @xmath137 angular resolution by @xcite .    of much less concern",
    "is the contamination due to unresolved sources and from known point - like sources .",
    "the latter contribution was computed by convolving our instrument beam with a grid where we placed sources extracted from the khr _",
    "et  al . _ ( 1981 ) and the green bank sky survey ( @xcite ) complemented by the michigan and metsahovi monitoring programme .",
    "the weakest considered source presents a flux density at 5 ghz of 0.18 jy .",
    "we extrapolate the flux density to our frequencies using the fit obtained by @xcite where available .",
    "fluxes of sources not present in @xcite , but for which we have measurements at three different frequencies , were fitted to a power law and extrapolated to our frequencies , while flat spectra were assumed for those sources for which flux densities were available only at a single frequency .",
    "for all channels and both demodulations the expected @xmath88 in the section of our data @xmath138 is much smaller than 1  @xmath120k .",
    "finally we refer to @xcite to also exclude the contribution from randomly distributed sources given our observing frequencies and beam width . in view of all these figures",
    "we conclude that outside the gp the only expected astronomical signal should be cmb .",
    "the data selected for the statistical analysis have been chosen under two requirements .",
    "first the selected bins must correspond to regions of high @xmath21 where we are confident that galactic emission is negligible .",
    "thus we have identified two sections in our data : @xmath139 for which @xmath140 and @xmath141 for which @xmath142 .",
    "the second requirement concerns the number of independent nights ( @xmath118 in equations  ( [ eq_stack1 ] ) and ( [ eq_stack2 ] ) ) used to generate the final data sets .",
    "this causes the different ra ranges ( columns 1 and 5 in table  [ tab_final_data_2 ] ) over which the selected data for each channel and demodulation span .",
    "this happens because the different editions and cleaning technique are performed independently for each channel and demodulation .",
    "the minimum number of independent nights required is @xmath118= 6 , except for channels 1 and 2 in the 2f demodulation where the higher number of used nights allows to increase this threshold up to 9 and 8 points respectively . in all cases",
    "the number of points used for generating the final data bins is large enough to allow to use the kolmogorov - smirnov test to check that our bins in the final data sets are consistent with being drawn from gaussian distributions .",
    "then , the likelihood function for a set of data @xmath143 is completely specified by giving the covariance matrix @xmath144 and the vector of means @xmath145 , which in our case is identically zero .",
    "then :    @xmath146    where @xmath147 denotes the determinant of @xmath144 .",
    "there are two independent contributions to the covariance matrix so that @xmath148 , where @xmath149 corresponds to the correlations between bins according to the model we are testing and shows dependence on the parameters to be estimated , and @xmath150 is the data covariance matrix computed directly from the data .",
    "we compute the elements @xmath114 of @xmath149 by assuming an intrinsic gaussian auto - correlation function ( gacf ) : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the angular separation between bins @xmath89 and @xmath115 , @xmath153 is the coherence angle , the angle of maximum sensitivity for each experimental configuration : @xmath154 and @xmath155 for the 1f and 2f data respectively and @xmath156 is the parameter to be estimated",
    ". we also have to consider the effects introduced by the finite width of the beam and the observing strategy .",
    "after convolving with the combination of gaussian beams reproducing our instrument responses ( see section  [ instrument ] ) , we obtain that the elements @xmath157 of the matrices @xmath158 and @xmath159 , for the 1f and 2f demodulation respectively , are given by :    @xmath160                                                     \\\\                   &    &                                                                                                      \\nonumber \\\\ { { \\bf v } } _ { t,2f}(i , j ) & = & \\aleph_{2f}^{2}\\times [   c_{m}({\\theta_{ij}};{\\sigma_{c}},{\\sigma_{c}},{\\sigma_{\\delta } } ) \\ , -\\ , c_{m}({\\theta_{ij}}+\\beta;{\\sigma_{c}},{\\sigma_{l}},{\\sigma_{\\delta } } ) \\ , +           \\nonumber \\\\                   &    &                           \\frac{1}{2 } c_{m}({\\theta_{ij}};{\\sigma_{l}},{\\sigma_{l}},{\\sigma_{\\delta}})- \\,c_{m}({\\theta_{ij}}-\\beta;{\\sigma_{c}},{\\sigma_{l}},{\\sigma_{\\delta } } )   \\ , +   \\nonumber \\\\                   &    &                           \\frac{1}{4 } ( c_{m}({\\theta_{ij}}+2 \\beta;{\\sigma_{c}},{\\sigma_{l}},{\\sigma_{\\delta } } ) \\ , + \\ , c_{m}({\\theta_{ij}}+2 \\beta;{\\sigma_{c}},{\\sigma_{l}},{\\sigma_{\\delta } } ) ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath161 $ ] and , as obtained in section  [ instrument ] , @xmath162 and @xmath163 for the 1f and 2f demodulation respectively .    in a bayesian interpretation with uniform prior , the likelihood ( @xmath164 ) as a function of the positive definite parameter @xmath156 is directly proportional to the probability density function of @xmath156",
    ". then the best estimation of @xmath156 is that value for which @xmath165 is maximum while confidence levels @xmath166 $ ] to a c% level have been computed by requiring @xmath167 and @xmath168 . in",
    "what follows detections are given to a 68% cl , and upper limits to a 95% cl .",
    "a claim of detection is made whenever the lower limit of the confidence interval at 68% cl is not zero , otherwise we quote the upper limit at 95% cl .      we have applied the likelihood analysis to each channel and demodulation in the ranges : @xmath139 , @xmath141 and @xmath139 + @xmath141 .",
    "the results of these analysis are given in table  [ tab_like_individual ] .",
    "in all cases the values obtained in all these ra ranges are consistent with the presence of a common signal . for channel 2 at 1f demodulation",
    "the results between @xmath139 and @xmath141 are still marginally consistent , but the result in the @xmath139 section shows a strong dependence on the choice of individual nights to generate the final data set . accordingly in what follows we will only consider the @xmath141 section for channel 2 at 1f .    for channels 1 and 2 , in all valid ranges and in both demodulations , the signals detected are consistent between them and with values of @xmath169k .",
    "these values are consistent with our previous results reported in @xcite , where we concluded that the slight excess of signal seen in channel 2 with respect to that obtained in channel 1 may indicate the presence of some residual levels of atmospheric noise at the same level as the expected cmb signal .",
    "the results obtained for channel 3 at both demodulations clearly indicate that it is still affected by important atmospheric residuals : cmb signal does not scale with frequency and our estimated signals due to diffuse galactic contamination at channel 3 amount to @xmath170 , too large a difference to be caused by the uncertainties in the galactic estimation procedure .",
    "the joint analysis of all three channels allows us to estimate the most likely signal which is common to all of our frequencies , such as cmb anisotropy . to estimate the correlation between channels",
    "we have computed the cross - correlation function between sections of data at 10 s which overlap in the same nights in channels @xmath89 and @xmath115 .",
    "we make use of the generalized wiener - khinchin relations for stationary processes to obtain one cross - correlation curve per night .",
    "the average of these curves are plotted in figure  [ fig_cross - corr ] .",
    "we observe that the cross - correlation becomes negligible at scales smaller than our binning in the final data sets , being only significantly different from zero at zero - lags as indicated in columns 2 and 4 in table  [ tab_like_pair ] .",
    "this cross - correlation at zero - lag enhances the diagonal terms in the sub - matrices which take into account the correlation between different channels in the covariance matrix @xmath150 .",
    "this effect has been analyzed and discussed in detail by @xcite , concluding that the net effect is an increase of the error bars as compared with the case where not such correlations are present . in table",
    "[ tab_like_pair ] we present the results from the joint analysis of any two channels and all three channels for each demodulation .",
    "these results have been obtained by using the whole data set except for those involving channel 2 at 1f for which only the @xmath141 section of the data set was used .",
    "the analysis on any combination of 2 channels indicates the presence of common signal , which for the 1f demodulation is @xmath171k and @xmath172k for the 2f demodulation .",
    "although being completely consistent , these figures must be viewed with caution : the signal monotonically increases as we increase the frequencies of the channels being combined .",
    "this behavior again indicates the higher level of contamination in channel 3 for both demodulations .",
    "finally , we have also considered the case of having a superposition of cmb signal plus a signal with a spectral behavior different from a black - body . in this way we obtain the contamination due to a foreground component which is consistent with the data .",
    "we also assume a gacf with the same coherence angle as the cmb signal for the foreground signal in addition to a scaling of the signal with frequency .",
    "thus the foreground signal in channel 1 exhibits an intrinsic acf @xmath173~$ ] while channel @xmath115 ( @xmath174 ) shows @xmath175 . as in equation  ( [ eq_main ] )",
    "@xmath176 is the rayleigh - jeans to thermodynamic conversion factor ; @xmath177  ghz , @xmath178  ghz and @xmath179  ghz the frequencies for channels 1 , 2 and 3 respectively . by setting the value of @xmath45 to the appropriate values",
    "we obtain the signal due to any of the foreground contaminants .",
    "the likelihood function now becomes a function of two parameters to be estimated : @xmath180 .",
    "since , @xmath181 , we do not have any information about either of them we obtain the probability distribution function of @xmath182 by marginalizing with respect to @xmath183 and vice - versa . in table  [ tab_like_fgd ] we present the results of this analysis for different values of the spectral index @xmath45 covering the ranges expected for dust , atmospheric , synchrotron and free - free emission . in figures  [ fig_contour1 ] and [ fig_contour2 ]",
    "we show the contour plots for the spectral indexes @xmath184  2.0 , 0.0 , -2.1 and -3.0 , corresponding to dust , a simple atmospheric model , free - free and synchrotron emission in rayleigh - jeans approximation .",
    "the data are then converted into thermodynamic units in the plots .",
    "small departures from these nominal values yield essentially the same results as seen in table 10 .",
    "the joint analysis of channels 1 , 2 and 3 at the 2f demodulation reveals the presence of a common signal with @xmath185k .",
    "the conversion to band power estimates ( e.g. @xcite ) yields @xmath186 at @xmath187 in good agreement with our previous results in @xcite ( @xmath188k for a gacf or @xmath189 in the band power estimate notation ) . at similar angular scales , @xmath190 , @xcite quote a value of @xmath191 .",
    "we have also tested the possibility that part of the detected common signal is due to contamination by galactic foregrounds or residual atmospheric contamination .",
    "the analysis confirms that dust can not be responsible of the detected signal ( @xmath192k ) , leaving a cmb signal of @xmath193k which corresponds to @xmath194 . after considering calibration uncertainty as a systematic effect",
    "the figures above become @xmath195k and @xmath196 .",
    "less conclusive is our analysis when a free - free or synchrotron spectrum is assumed for the contaminant signal .",
    "then we only have vague upper limits for the contaminants which were known in advance from both our estimations and results from the tenerife experiment when observing at @xmath197 .",
    "as indicated in section  [ foregrounds ] , the free - free contamination seen by the tenerife experiment at 33 ghz is about 4 @xmath120k .",
    "the extrapolation in frequency renders this source of contamination to values @xmath198k at both demodulations and in all channels .",
    "these upper limits are further reduced by the fact that our experiment probes higher values of @xmath15 s than those probed by the tenerife experiment , and at high @xmath21 the galactic power spectrum scales as @xmath199(@xcite;@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of atmospheric residuals is also tested by allowing for the presence of a signal with a spectral index in antenna temperature of @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "the @xmath202 case corresponds to the approximate case in which the effective atmospheric temperature is the same in all our channels .",
    "the @xmath203 and @xmath201 cases allow an increase with frequency of the effective atmospheric temperature .",
    "for all the considered @xmath45 values , the likelihood assigns the bulk of the fluctuations to cmb signal : @xmath204k , @xmath205k . as shown in table 9 , these values are rather insensitive to the exact choice of the spectral index @xmath45 .",
    "the two - component joint likelihood analysis on the 1f data places the bulk of the signal on the atmospheric component : @xmath206k and @xmath207k , which in flat band power estimate becomes @xmath208 . treating the calibration uncertainty as a systematic effect , the above results for the cmb component become : @xmath209k and @xmath210 .",
    "having a large atmospheric signal in our 1f data is expected because the 1f demodulation is known to be less efficient in removing linear gradients in the atmospheric signal .",
    "however , a significant fraction of the signal is projected to the cmb component which is marginally consistent with the 2f result . when testing for the presence of galactic contamination the two - component likelihood analyses yield low significance detection for a dust component , and only upper limits to contamination by free - free or synchrotron emission .",
    "this work demonstrates that it is possible to achieve sensitivities of a few tens of @xmath120k in the study of cmb temperature anisotropy at millimetric wavelengths from ground based observatories .",
    "this requires sites with stable and dry atmosphere and the combination of long observing periods , measurements at several frequencies and a careful subtraction of the atmospheric contribution .",
    "other conclusions of this work are :    1 .",
    "the sensitivity achieved in the 2f demodulation allows us to identify a common signal between our channels with a value of @xmath185k corresponding to a band power estimate of @xmath211 at @xmath187 at 68% cl including the systematic effect due to calibration uncertainty .",
    "we believe calibration uncertainty should be treated as a systematic error and not added in quadrature to the error bar .",
    "our value is consistent with the detection reported by the saskatoon experiment at the same angular scale .",
    "3 .   two alternative arguments ( one based on extrapolations from galactic templates , the other on results from other experiments ) allow us to discard a galactic origin of the detected signal .",
    "an extension of the likelihood analysis allowing the presence of a signal with the assumed spectrum for the atmospheric emission also discards the possibility of the signal being caused by correlated atmospheric residuals .",
    "we have used a simple technique for reducing the atmospheric noise in millimetric observations .",
    "we have presented tests on the performance of this technique by looking at the power spectra of the data before and after applying it .",
    "the reduction of the noise is also observed by comparing the distribution of the noise before and after cleaning the data .",
    "we have detected the galactic plane crossing in all cleaned channels at both demodulations .",
    "this constitutes the best check of the performance of the technique .",
    "6 .   in all channels",
    "the 1f data show an excess of signal with respect to the 2f data .",
    "this excess is suspected to be of atmospheric origin .",
    "the two - component joint likelihood analysis assigns a portion of the detected signal to cmb fluctuations at a level of @xmath212k or in band power estimate @xmath213 at 68% cl including calibration uncertainty as a systematic effect .",
