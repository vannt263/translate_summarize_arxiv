    "in this paper we prove a product - to - sum formula that holds for the quantization of the moduli space of flat @xmath0-connections on the torus .",

    "the algebra of observables is densely generated by the functions of the form @xmath2 , @xmath3 integers .",
    "the quantization of such a function consists of the coloring of the curve of slope @xmath4 on the torus by the virtual representation @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the greatest common divisor of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and we denote by @xmath11 the @xmath12-dimensional irreducible representation of the quantum group of @xmath1 . in the work reshetikhin and turaev",
    "@xmath13 is only defined for @xmath14 , but we will see below how this definition is extended to all integers .",
    "let us denote by @xmath15 the operator that is associated by the quantization to @xmath2 .",
    "a product - to - sum formula for the version of these operators defined using the kauffman bracket was discovered in @xcite and that is what inspired the following result .",
    "[ mainresult ] in any level @xmath16 and for any integers @xmath17 the following product - to - sum formula holds @xmath18    so we see that the quantization of the algebra of the observables on the moduli space of flat @xmath0-connections on the torus is isomorphic to a subalgebra of the noncommutative torus defined by rieffel @xcite .",
    "to be more rigorous , the above product - to - sum formula induces a @xmath19-product on the algebra of functions on the character variety on the torus .",
    "this @xmath19-algebra is a subalgebra of the noncommutative torus .",
    "the noncommutative torus is a @xmath20-algebra generated by @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are two unitary operators satisfying the exponential form of the heisenberg noncommutation relations @xmath25 .",
    "the inclusion is given by @xmath26 the elements @xmath27 are the noncommutative cosines , so theorem [ mainresult ] is nothing but the product - to - sum formula for noncommutative cosines .",
    "of course , @xmath28 root of unity is the situation rieffel did not consider , for here the rotation angle in the definition of the noncommutative torus is rational .",
    "what we consider to be a nice feature of this paper is that the proof of this result about the quantization of moduli spaces uses topological cut - and - paste techniques .",
    "let us briefly discuss the case of the torus and then state the main result .",
    "the moduli space of flat @xmath0-connections on the torus is the `` pillow case '' , the quotient of the complex plane by the lattice @xmath29 $ ] and by the symmetry with respect to the origin .",
    "this space is the same as the character variety of @xmath0-representations of the fundamental group of the torus .",
    "the algebra of observables , i.e. the algebra of functions on this space , is generated for example by the functions @xmath30 , where @xmath31 are integer numbers with @xmath32 and @xmath3 coprime .",
    "a function of this form has a geometric interpretation , namely it associates to a conjugacy class of flat connections the trace of the holonomy of the connection along the curve of slope @xmath33 , where the trace is computed in the @xmath6-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath0 .",
    "witten defined the path integral only for functions of this form , but the definition can be extended to any ( smooth ) function on the character variety to yield an operator @xmath34 where @xmath35 is defined using approximations of @xmath36 by sums of traces of holonomies of the type describe above , @xmath37 is the chern - simmons functional for connections on the cylinder over the torus , @xmath12 being the level of quantization , and the path integral is taken over all connections @xmath38 that interpolate between two flat connections on the boundary components of the cylinder over the torus .",
    "witten s construction was made rigorous by reshetikhin and turaev using the quantum group of @xmath1 at roots of unity . here",
    "is how this is done for the torus .",
    "fix a level @xmath39 , and let @xmath40 . for",
    "an integer @xmath6 define @xmath41=(t^{2n}-t^{-2n})/(t^2-t^{-2})$ ] .",
    "the quantum analogue of the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath42 is the algebra @xmath43 with generators @xmath44 satisfying @xmath45    this is a hopf algebra , thus its representations form a ring under direct sum and tensor product .",
    "modulo a small technicality where one factors by the part of quantum trace zero , this ring contains a subring generated by finitely many irreducible representations @xmath46 . the representation @xmath13 has the basis @xmath47 and @xmath43 acts on this basis by @xmath48e_{j+1}\\\\   & & ye_j=[m - j+1]e_{j-1}\\\\ & & ke_j = t^{2j}e_j.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the quantum version of the clebsch - gordon theorem , these irreducible representations can be defined recursively by @xmath49 .",
    "this definition works only for @xmath50 .    with these representations we color any knot @xmath51 in a 3-dimensional manifold , and the coloring",
    "is denoted by @xmath52 .",

    "the hilbert space of the torus @xmath57 has an orthonormal basis given by @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "now the convention is made that @xmath60 and with this in mind we can extend the definition of @xmath61 to all @xmath6 via the recursion @xmath62 here @xmath63 is just @xmath53 colored by the representation @xmath64 .    to make sense of these notations recall the pairing @xmath65 on @xmath57 obtained by gluing two solid tori such that the meridian of the first is identified with the longitude of the second and vice versa , as to obtain a 3-sphere .",
    "this pairing is not an inner product but is nondegenerate .",
    "pairing two elements of @xmath57 yields a colored link in the 3-sphere , and reshetikhin and turaev described in @xcite a way of associating a number to this link using the ribbon algebra structure of @xmath66 ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "we describe now the operator @xmath68 that corresponds to the function @xmath69 ( @xmath70 stands for sine ) .",
    "since the pairing is nondegenerate , it suffices to describe @xmath71 .",
    "this number is computed by placing the curve of slope @xmath4 on the boundary of the solid torus , then gluing another torus to it to obtain the 3-sphere , coloring the @xmath4-curve by @xmath72 , the core of the first torus by @xmath13 and the core of the second torus by @xmath73 and then evaluating the colored link diagram as in @xcite .",
    "we neglected the discussion about the framing , and the invariants of reshetikhin and turaev are defined for framed knots and links .",
    "the curve @xmath74 will always be framed by the annulus @xmath75 $ ] while the curve of slope @xmath4 has the vertical framing ( i.e. the framing defined by the vector field orthogonal to the torus ) .",
    "the quantization of the function @xmath76 is the operator @xmath77 here @xmath78 stands for cosine and the definition is motivated by the trigonometric formula @xmath79 these are the operators for which we prove the product - to - sum formula .",
    "unlike the case of @xcite , here an easy inductive proof will not work .",
    "the proof we give below was inspired by the computation of the colored jones polynomials of torus knots from @xcite .",
    "it uses an apparatus called _ topological quantum field theory with corners _ , which enables the computation of quantum invariants of 3-manifolds through a successive application of axioms .",
    "this system of axioms is in spirit analogous to the eilenberg - maclane system of axioms for homology .",
    "the fundamental principles of a tqft with corners were summarized by walker in @xcite .",
    "the construction of the basic data for the case of the quantum group @xmath43 was initiated in @xcite and completed in @xcite .",
    "let us discuss just the facts about the @xmath1 tqft with corners needed in the proof of theorem [ mainresult ] . as explained in @xcite , a tqft in dimension three consists of a modular functor @xmath22 that associates vector spaces to surfaces and isomorphisms to homeomorphisms , and a partition function that associates to each three dimensional manifold a vector in the vector space of its boundary .    walker refined this point of view in @xcite .",
    "he considered decompositions of surfaces into disks , annuli , and pairs of pants , called dap - decompositions , which correspond through the functor to basis of the vector space .",
    "his dap - decompositions ( which should probably be called rigid structures ) involve more structure than that .",
    "this structure consists of some curves , called seams and drawn like dotted lines in diagrams , which keep track of the twistings that occur and are not detected by the change in dap - decompositions .",
    "transformations of dap - decompositions are called moves and have the vector space correspondent of the change of basis . they are useful in preparing the boundary of a 3-manifold for a gluing with corners .",
    "let us point out that for @xmath43 one needs also an orientation of the decomposition curves , as explained in @xcite where it was encoded using the klein four group , but this fact is irrelevant for all computations below , so we do not refer to it again .",
    "also , walker considered framed , or extended manifolds , which are pairs @xmath80 with @xmath81 a manifold and @xmath6 an integer , necessary to make the partition function well defined . in this paper we begin the computation with manifolds with framing zero .",
    "the framing only changes when we perform moves on boundary tori , and there the change is computed using the shale - weil cocycle .",
    "however all relevant changes are performed back and forth , so the framing cancels .",
    "thus we simply ignore it .",

    "the vector space of the torus @xmath57 is the same as the hilbert space of the quantization of the moduli space of flat @xmath0-connections on the torus .",
    "the pairing on the torus makes @xmath83 an orthonormal basis , but we do nt need this fact now .",

    "the move @xmath86 is diagonal and its @xmath89th entry is @xmath90 .",
    "the quantum invariant ( i.e. partition function ) of the cylinder over a surface is the identity matrix .",

    "if the dap - decomposition of a 3-manifold involves two disjoint annuli , then its invariant can be written in the form @xmath92 gluing the two annuli produces a 3-manifold that in the newly obtained dap - decomposition has the invariant equal to @xmath93}v_{k , k}$ ] .",

    "the expression in ( [ invariant1 ] ) is the invariant of the link that has one component equal to the @xmath108-curve on a torus colored by @xmath109 , and the other two components the cores of the two solid tori that lie on one side and the other of the torus knot , colored by @xmath13 ( the one inside ) and @xmath73 ( the one outside ) . the expression in ( [ invariant2 ] ) is the invariant of the same link but with the @xmath108-curve colored by @xmath110 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this number is equal to @xmath111 times the coordinate of @xmath112 of the vector that is the quantum invariant of the link complement .",
