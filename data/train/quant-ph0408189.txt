    "in textbooks on quantum mechanics one finds a lot of solvable models .",
    "they mostly offer just a rough approximation to a physical situation . at the same time",
    ", their simplicity enables us to avoid some inessential technical difficulties . in this sense",
    "they provide a basic insight in physical phenomena appearing in complicated realistic systems .",
    "also the basic properties of @xmath0-symmetric quantum mechanics @xcite may be tested by the most elementary quantum mechanical models .",
    "one of them has been proposed in  @xcite as a description of a particle moving in a purely imaginary antisymmetric potential . in its time - independent schroedinger equation h=(x)=e(x ) ,  x(-1,0)(0,1 ) [ squarewell]the dirichlet boundary conditions were introduced at @xmath1 .",
    "the role of the growing non - hermiticity @xmath2 was studied and shown to induce a spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath0-symmetry at @xmath3 ( cf . also  @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting application of the latter model has been found in  @xcite where the whole supersymmetric hierarchy of solvable potentials has been assigned to the most trivial  zeroth - term \" member ( [ squarewell ] ) of the family .    in the present note",
    "we intend to replace the dirichlet boundary conditions at @xmath1 ( mimicking a simple confined motion ) by their periodic alternative which would represent the slightly more sophisticated motion of the particle along a circle .",
    "our main motivation stems from an observation  @xcite that a weakening of the hermiticity ( or , in our present language , of @xmath4symmetry @xcite ) to @xmath5symmetry may cause serious difficulties in some exactly solvable models . in  @xcite",
    "this problem has been revealed during a study of angular schrdinger equations with certain potentials of a multiple - well shape over the circle .",
    "unfortunately , even after a replacement of these potentials by their schematic square - well forms , the solution of the related bound - state problem proved more or less purely numerical .",
    "we see the main source of the latter difficulty in an over - complicated structure of the underlying trigonometric secular equations in the ",
    "realistic \" multi - square - well cases . for this reason we intend to return to the  non - realistic \" single - step potential in equation  ( [ squarewell ] ) subject to the periodic boundary conditions",
    ". we shall show and see that a graphical analysis of such a problem remains tractable non - numerically .",
    "assuming that the energies are real , the solution of  ( [ squarewell ] ) may be sought in the form _ 1(x)&=&a_1e^kx+a_2e^-kx ,    x(0,1 ) , + _",

    "1(0)=_2(0 ) ,  _1(0)=_2(0).[per.bound.cond.]substituting  ( [ ansatz ] ) into  ( [ per.bound.cond . ] ) , we obtain a system of linear equations for unknown coefficients @xmath7 .",
    "it has non - trivial solution if and only if the determinant of its matrix @xmath8 vanishes , w=4e^2k(-1+e^2k)^2k^2=0[det]dividing @xmath9 into its real and imaginary part and using the following relations @xmath10 we can rewrite  ( [ det ] ) as w= 4e^-2t(-1+e^2t)^2t^2 + ( -1+())=0.[trepr ] for large @xmath11 the first term in  ( [ trepr ] ) is dominant and exponentially grows to infinity , see fig.1 .",
    "the roots @xmath11 have a positive upper bound and the energy is bounded from below , consequently .    in the vicinity of @xmath12",
    "the determinant in  ( [ trepr ] ) exhibits oscillations caused by the dominance of the non - positive second term .",
    "still , a positive perturbation caused by the first term implies the existence of the infinitely many real and non - degenerate nodal doublets in each oscillation at the sufficiently small @xmath11 .",
    "empirically , this feature has been observed in  @xcite but its essence lied hidden in the complicated form of the determinant .",
    "to study the spectrum for infinitesimally small @xmath13 , it is convenient to rewrite  ( [ det ] ) in its alternative @xmath14-representation 8s^2(-1+(2s))+e^- ( -1+e^)^2=0[srepr ] obviously , in the hermitian limit @xmath15 the energies coincide with the spectrum of the circular oscillator , @xmath16 .",
    "we can ask how these  unperturbed \" energies will be effected by a very small perturbation @xmath17 .",
    "it can be expected that there will appear correction terms in energy description .",
    "the secular equation  ( [ det ] ) can be rewritten as ( tt+ ss)(tt - ss)=0.[tsdet]we expect the correction to the hermitian case in the following form s = n+(t ) ,  = ^_0a_it^i.[skorekce]substituting the ansatz into  ( [ tsdet ] ) and comparing coefficients at the corresponding powers of @xmath11 , we get _ & = & t^2 + ( - ) t^4 + & & + ( -1)^n ( - ) t^6 + ..  .[rho]in contrast to unperturbed spectrum of infinite square well , the energies of @xmath0-symmetric square - well are divided into two families .",

    "it has been observed in  @xcite that as the coupling @xmath2 rises over a critical value @xmath18 , two lowest energy levels of the infinite square - well coalesce and become complex conjugate simultaneously .",
    "this happens repeatedly as the coupling rises , so that there exists a sequence of critical values z_0^(crit)<z_1^(crit)<z_2^(crit) ..",
    "<z_^(crit ) [ critseq]for which the corresponding energy pair @xmath19 merges and becomes complex .",
    "we can observe the very same situation in the case of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in fig.2 , an intersection of @xmath20 with the boarders of black and white area determines the root of  ( [ trepr ] ) .",
    "merging of the highest roots for rising coupling @xmath2 is then quite transparent .    in order to study the system in the broken @xmath0-symmetry regime , we make the following ansatz of the wave function associated with energy @xmath21 @xmath22 _",

    "the first two members of the sequence  ( [ critseq ] ) were determined as @xmath33 , @xmath34 . in our case of periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the critical values of the coupling seem to be risen .",
    "we propose that periodic boundary conditions strengthen @xmath0-symmetry of the system .",
    "the paper was intended as a connection between  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite . to meet this intention",
    ", we studied solutions of  ( [ squarewell ] ) with periodic boundary conditions .    on one hand , the simpler choice of the potential allowed a deeper insight into spectral behavior of periodic square - well , which was the missing link in  @xcite .",
    "we made a basic analytical observation and found approximation of energies for very small couplings @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , we could compare our results with the ones corresponding to the infinite square - well  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "this was interesting mainly in the regime of broken @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "after the comparison , one concludes that @xmath0-symmetry is weakened by dirichlet boundary conditions or vice versa , it is strengthened in the circular domain .",
