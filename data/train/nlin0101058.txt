    "@xcite and @xcite ( from now on referred to as parts  ii and  iii ) originate from our previous work on reflectionless analytic difference operators of relativistic calogero  moser type , cf",
    ".  refs .  @xcite . in our conference contribution ref .",
    "@xcite we already discussed the possible existence of an extensive class of self - adjoint reflectionless analytic difference operators containing those studied in ref .",
    "the present series of papers serves to enlarge the scenario envisaged in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in particular confirms some conjectures made there .",
    "in this first part we restrict attention to the algebraic aspects of a huge class of analytic difference operators that admit reflectionless eigenfunctions .",
    "in part  ii we show that these operators and eigenfunctions can be tied in with a non - local soliton evolution equation , and with integrable ( classical ) @xmath0-body systems of relativistic calogero  moser type .",
    "part  iii is concerned with a restricted class , for which we are able to prove self - adjointness of the analytic difference operators by exploiting various features of the reflectionless eigenfunctions .",
    "we proceed by delineating the analytic difference operators at issue in this paper .",
    "they are of the form [ defa ] a = t_i+v_a(x)t_-i+v_b(x ) . here , the coefficients ( `` potentials '' ) @xmath1 and @xmath2 are functions from the field @xmath3 of meromorphic functions , and the translations @xmath4 are defined by [ deft ] ( t_f)(x)f(x-),^*,f .",
    "we only consider potentials satisfying [ vas ] _",
    "|re x| v_a(x)=1 , _ |re x| v_b(x)=0 .",
    "hence the analytic difference operator @xmath5 becomes equal to the `` free '' analytic difference operator ( henceforth a@xmath6o ) [ a0 ] a_0t_i+t_-i for @xmath7 .",
    "obviously , @xmath8 admits plane wave eigenfunctions @xmath9 with eigenvalue @xmath10 for all @xmath11 .",
    "it is therefore a natural question whether the a@xmath6o @xmath5 , viewed as a linear operator on @xmath3 , admits eigenfunctions with eigenvalue @xmath10 and plane wave asymptotics for @xmath12 .",
    "more specifically , this question reads : do there exist functions @xmath13 , satisfying [ aeig ] aw ( x , p)=(e^p+e^-p)w(x , p ) , [ w+ ] w(x , p)~(ixp ) , x , [ w- ] w(x , p)~a(p)(ixp)+b(p)(-ixp ) , x- , for generic @xmath14 ?    to our knowledge , this question has not been addressed in previous literature .",
    "here we do not answer it either .",
    "however , we do present a vast class of potential pairs @xmath15 , @xmath16 for which we answer the question in the affirmative . moreover , the pertinent eigenfunctions are reflectionless , in the sense that in ( [ w- ] ) one has @xmath17 .",
    "they are of the form [ wform ] w(x , p)=(ixp ) ( 1-_n=1^n ) , where @xmath18 are distinct complex numbers , and @xmath19 .",
    "( here and below , @xmath20  denotes the space of meromorphic functions with the zero function deleted . )",
    "it should be emphasized at the outset that whenever such eigenfunctions exist , they are highly non - unique . indeed , introducing the infinite - dimensional space [ cpa ]",
    "p_\\ { ^ * ( x+)=(x ) } , ^ * , of @xmath21-periodic multipliers , one verifies first of all that whenever @xmath22 satisfies ( [ aeig ] ) for a certain @xmath23 , then the function @xmath24 also satisfies ( [ aeig ] ) for all @xmath25 . moreover , introducing [ cpac ] p_(c)\\ { _ | _ |re x| ( x)=c , c } , and choosing @xmath26 , the function @xmath24 has once more plane wave asymptotics for @xmath27 . thus , when we supplement the numbers @xmath18 occurring in ( [ wform ] ) with further complex numbers @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 are distinct , then the function [ wamb ] ( x , p ) ( x , p ) ( 1-_n = n+1^m ) , _",
    "n_i(0 ) , is of the same form , and satisfies ( [ aeig])([w- ] ) as well .    for the class of potentials involved , however",
    ", this non - uniqueness can be obviated by restricting attention to `` residue functions '' @xmath30 with quite special properties .",
    "( this is shown in lemma  4.2 below . ) in point of fact , we will first define functions @xmath19 as the unique solutions to a certain system of @xmath0 linear equations , given by ( [ sysn ] ) .",
    "this system involves suitably constrained complex numbers @xmath31 , cf .",
    "( [ req1 ] ) , ( [ req2 ] ) , and multipliers @xmath32 satisfying ( [ req3 ] ) .",
    "subsequently , we define a function @xmath33 by ( [ wform ] ) .",
    "then we show that this function has asymptotics ( [ w+ ] ) and ( [ w- ] ) with @xmath17 , and prove that there exists a uniquely determined a@xmath6o @xmath5 of the above type satisfying ( [ aeig ] ) for @xmath34 .",
    "( for this discrete set of @xmath35-values the wave function @xmath33 ( [ wform ] ) is of course ill defined . )",
    "the procedure just sketched will be detailed in section  2 .",
    "it owes much to the account of reflectionless schrdinger operators that can be found in newell s monograph ref .",
    "more generally , it is inspired by the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) for one - dimensional self - adjoint schrdinger and jacobi operators . as is well known ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite ) , in the reflectionless case one winds up with a linear system of @xmath0 equations , where  @xmath0 is the number of bound states .",
    "this system involves the cauchy matrix @xmath36 , just as the system ( [ sysn ] ) .",
    "( we have relegated the features of @xmath36 we need to appendix  a. )    our class of a@xmath6os admitting reflectionless eigenfunctions is far more extensive than the reflectionless schrdinger and jacobi operators obtained via the ist .",
    "this is because we can allow arbitrary multiplier functions @xmath37 from the infinite - dimensional space @xmath38 , cf .",
    "( [ req3 ] ) .",
    "choosing @xmath37 equal to the constant @xmath39 for all @xmath40 , it is still `` twice as large '' , in the sense that we neither require @xmath41 nor conditions on @xmath39 .",
    "on the other hand , we do require constant multipliers and reality conditions in part  iii of this series , which deals with hilbert space aspects  @xcite .",
    "indeed , we need such constraints in order to exploit the wave function @xmath33 for associating to the a@xmath6o @xmath5 a bona fide self - adjoint operator @xmath42 on the hilbert space @xmath43 .",
    "( to date , a general self - adjointness theory in which our indirect definition of @xmath42 fits is not available . )    for our present purposes it suffices to mention one prominent fact illustrating the considerable differences between reflectionless self - adjoint a@xmath6os and reflectionless self - adjoint schrdinger and jacobi operators .",
    "this is the existence of an infinite - dimensional family of self - adjoint reflectionless a@xmath6os without _ any _ bound states .",
    "( actually , a smaller , but still infinite - dimensional family of such a@xmath6os can already be found in our paper ref .",
    "@xcite , cf .",
    "also ref .",
    "this circumstance shows that one should not expect a straightforward analog of the direct transform associated with the schrdinger and jacobi cases , and indeed we have very little to say about the direct problem for a@xmath6os .",
    "we continue with a more detailed account of the organization and results of this paper .",
    "as mentioned above , section  2 is concerned with the groundwork for this series of papers .",
    "fixing @xmath44 , the multipliers ( [ req3 ] ) already form an infinite - dimensional family , yet they are by no means the largest class giving rise to a@xmath6os admitting reflectionless eigenfunctions . to illustrate the freedom involved , we have made a close - up of the @xmath45 case , where all pertinent objects can be inspected without difficulty .    the restrictions ( [ req1 ] ) and ( [ req2 ] ) are primarily motivated by the applications in parts  ii and iii , where they will be seen to be quite natural .",
    "on the other hand , for the soliton solutions in part  ii and for all of part  iii we also need the multipliers to be constant .",
    "it is a striking feature of the algebraic viewpoint adopted in this first part that the freedom allowed by ( [ req3 ] ) does not give rise to any additional difficulty , as compared to allowing only constants .",
    "( by contrast , when we try to relax the requirements ( [ req1 ] ) , ( [ req2 ] ) and  ( [ req3 ] ) , we typically find that some of our arguments break down . ) in particular , one obtains the same transmission coefficient ( given by ( [ af ] ) ) for all of these multipliers .",
    "section  3 contains on the one hand some general insights bearing on the question whether the potential @xmath2 can vanish identically . on the other hand",
    ", these results point the way towards special cases where one does have @xmath46 .",
    "this enables us to show that when all of the numbers @xmath47 in ( [ req1 ] ) have imaginary parts in @xmath48 or in @xmath49 , then the wave function is not only an eigenfunction of @xmath5 ( [ defa ] ) with eigenvalue @xmath50 , but also an eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath51 of an a@xmath6o s_=t_i/2+v(x)t_-i/2,=+,- . here",
    ", one has _ |re x| v(x)=1 , and @xmath52 corresponds to @xmath53 belonging to @xmath48/@xmath49 , resp .",
    "since we _ construct _ reflectionless wave functions @xmath33 and a@xmath6os @xmath5 related via ( [ aeig ] ) from given data @xmath54 satisfying ( [ req1 ] ) , ( [ req2 ] ) and ( [ req3 ] ) , it is an obvious question whether distinct data @xmath54 can give rise to the same @xmath33 and/or @xmath5 .",
    "section  4 is devoted to a study of this injectivity problem .",
    "as it turns out , it is rather easy to answer the question completely for @xmath33 , cf .",
    "theorem  4.1 .",
    "for @xmath5 , however , our results are not complete .",
    "but the partial answers we obtain in lemmas  4.24.4 yield considerable evidence for our conjecture that the `` generalized ist map '' from @xmath54 to @xmath5 is injective up to permutations .",
    "this paper is concluded with four appendixes . in appendix",
    "a we collect some information on matrices of cauchy and vandermonde type that occur in the main text .",
    "appendix  b concerns the casorati determinants associated to the solutions of the ordinary second - order analytic difference equations at hand .",
    "its results are of interest in itself .",
    "they are also a crucial input for our study of the injectivity problem in section  4 .    in appendix",
    "c we obtain alternative representations for various important quantities , including the wave function and potentials . in appendix",
    "d we use these formulas to show that the a@xmath6o @xmath5 ( [ defa ] ) is _ formally _ self - adjoint on @xmath55 , provided the numbers @xmath56 , @xmath57 , are purely imaginary and the functions @xmath58 , @xmath57 , are real - valued for real @xmath59 .",
    "consider a function of the form ( [ wform ] ) , with @xmath19 and @xmath18 distinct numbers in @xmath61 , written as z_n(-r_n ) , r_n ( -,],n=1,  ,n , but without further constraints for the moment .",
    "introducing the auxiliary wave function [ defaux ] a(x , p)=_n=1^n(e^p - e^-r_n)(x , p ) , it follows from ( [ wform ] ) that @xmath62 can be rewritten as [ auxform ] a(x , p)=e^ixp ( e^np+_k=0^n-1c_k(x)e^kp),c_k .",
    "here we have in particular [ ca]c_0(x)=_n=1^n(-e^-r_n)(x ) , ( x)1+_n=1^ne^r_nr_n(x ) , [ cb ] c_n-1(x)=_n=1^n(-e^-r_n - r_n(x ) ) .",
    "let us now ask : when is @xmath62 an eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath10 of an a@xmath6o  @xmath5 of the form ( [ defa ] ) ?",
    "clearly , this amounts to @xmath62 satisfying the analytic difference equation ( from now on a@xmath6e ) [ aade ] a(x - i , p)+v_a(x)a(x+i , p)+(v_b(x)-e^p - e^-p)a(x , p)=0 , for certain functions @xmath63 . in view of the simple structure ( [ auxform ] ) of @xmath62 , this comes down to a system of @xmath64 equations relating the functions @xmath65 and potentials @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , the vanishing of the coefficients of @xmath66 and @xmath67 is equivalent to the relations [ vbc ] c_n-1(x - i)+v_b(x)-c_n-1(x)=0 , [ vac ] v_a(x)c_0(x+i)-c_0(x)=0 .",
    "therefore , @xmath2 is uniquely determined by @xmath62 , and so is @xmath1 , provided @xmath68 does not vanish identically .    of course , for @xmath69 this reasoning yields the unsurprising consequence @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "but already for @xmath45 one gets in addition to ( [ vbc ] ) and ( [ vac ] ) the relation [ n1a ] v_a(x)+v_b(x)c_0(x)-1=0(n=1 ) . using ( [ vbc ] ) and ( [ vac ] ) ,",
    "this amounts to @xmath72 satisfying [ n1b ] + [ c_0(x)-c_0(x - i)]c_0(x)=1 ( n=1 ) .",
    "thus , even in this simple case the extra constraint looks forbidding .    more generally , when one starts from a function @xmath62 of the form ( [ auxform ] ) with @xmath73 , and defines @xmath15 and @xmath16 by [ vadef ] v_a(x)c_0(x)/c_0(x+i ) , [ vbdef ] v_b(x)c_n-1(x)-c_n-1(x - i ) , it seems hopeless to solve the @xmath0 remaining nonlinear a@xmath6es for the coefficients @xmath65 .",
    "even so , we are going to construct a large class of solutions by viewing @xmath62 as arising from ( [ wform ] ) via ( [ defaux ] ) .",
    "we have already seen that these formulas determine the coefficients  @xmath74 in ( [ auxform ] ) in terms of complex numbers @xmath75 and `` residue functions '' @xmath76 .",
    "as it turns out , @xmath76 can be defined via a linear system of  @xmath0 equations such that ( [ aade ] ) is obeyed , provided @xmath15 is defined by ( [ vadef ] ) and ( [ ca ] ) , and  @xmath16 by ( [ vbdef ] ) and ( [ cb ] ) .",
    "it is illuminating to present the details first for @xmath45 . using ( [ cb ] ) ( or ( [ ca ] ) ) to express  @xmath77 in terms of the residue function @xmath78 at the pole @xmath79 of @xmath33 ,",
    "we begin by noting [ a - r ] a(x ,- r)=-e^-irxr(x ) , [ a+r ] a(x , r)=e^irx(e^r - e^-r - r(x ) ) . for the pertinent linear constraint on @xmath80",
    "we now need to require @xmath81 , or , equivalently , @xmath82 .",
    "then it reads [ rcon ] ( x)e^-2irxr(x)+r(x)=1 , where @xmath83 is an arbitrary function in @xmath84 ( [ cpa ] ) .",
    "obviously , ( [ rcon ] ) determines a unique function @xmath85 .",
    "the crux of the constraint ( [ rcon ] ) is that it guarantees that @xmath62 fulfils [ arel ] a(x , r)=(e^-r - e^r)(x)a(x ,- r),_i , as is clear from ( [ a - r ] ) , ( [ a+r ] ) .",
    "next , we observe that a function @xmath86 of the form [ e1 ] e(x , p)=e^ixp(e^p+c(x ) ) , is uniquely determined when it satisfies [ e2 ] e(x , r)=(e^-r - e^r)(x)e(x ,- r),_i . indeed , substituting ( [ e1 ] ) in ( [ e2 ] ) , one gets a linear constraint that uniquely determines @xmath87 .",
    "we are now going to exploit the uniqueness of @xmath88 .",
    "with @xmath89 determined by ( [ rcon ] ) , we define @xmath15 and @xmath16 via ( [ vadef ] ) , ( [ vbdef ] ) and ( [ cb ] ) . consider the function @xmath90 on the lhs of  ( [ aade ] ) . by construction",
    ", it is of the form ( x , p)=e^ixpd(x),d .",
    "moreover , on account of ( [ arel ] ) and the @xmath91-periodicity of @xmath83 , it obeys ( x , r)=(e^-r - e^r)(x)d(x ,- r ) .",
    "but then the function @xmath92 has the two features ( [ e1 ] ) , ( [ e2 ] ) that uniquely determine  @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , @xmath94 must vanish identically , so that @xmath62 solves the a@xmath6e ( [ aade ] ) .",
    "( in particular , this entails that @xmath95 solves the nonlinear a@xmath6e ( [ n1b ] ) . )",
    "the upshot is that the wave function ( x , p)=e^ixp ( 1- ) , with @xmath96 and @xmath85 given by ( [ rcon ] ) , satisfies the eigenvalue equation ( [ aeig ] ) , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 given by v_a(x)= , v_b(x)=r(x - i)-r(x ) .",
    "but we need further constraints to guarantee the asymptotics ( [ vas ] ) , ( [ w+ ] ) and ( [ w- ] )",
    ".    clearly , ( [ w+ ] ) and ( [ w- ] ) are equivalent to [ ras+ ] _ re x r(x)=0 , [ ras- ] _ re x- r(x)= ,",
    ". moreover , ( [ ras+ ] ) and ( [ ras- ] ) imply ( [ vas ] ) , provided @xmath97 . but",
    "( [ vas ] ) can be fulfilled without ( [ ras+ ] ) holding true .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath83 equal to @xmath98 , one gets @xmath99 as @xmath7 , cf .",
    "( [ rcon ] ) .    in the example",
    "just given the function @xmath100 has limit 0 for @xmath7 .",
    "but we can also let it diverge for @xmath27 , by choosing for instance @xmath101 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath102 as @xmath103 , so that ( [ vas ] ) , ( [ w+ ] ) and ( [ w- ] ) are satisfied , with @xmath104 and @xmath17 . as a result ,",
    "already for @xmath45 we obtain a huge class of a@xmath6os of the form ( [ defa])([vas ] ) admitting eigenfunctions @xmath33 of the form ( [ wform ] ) with _ trivial _ scattering .",
    "consider next the case [ c+ ] ( x)_i(c),c0 , r(0 , ) .",
    "then we read off from ( [ rcon ] ) that [ rdif ] _ re x r(x)=0 , _ re x- r(x)=e^r - e^-r .",
    "therefore , ( [ vas ] ) , ( [ w+ ] ) and ( [ w- ] ) are once again satisfied , now with @xmath17 and [ an1 ] a(p)=.    there is yet another way to obtain ( [ rdif ] ) and hence ( [ vas ] ) , ( [ w+ ] ) , ( [ w- ] ) , with @xmath17 and @xmath105 ( [ an1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , we may choose [ c- ] e^-2x ( x)_i(c),c0 , r(-,0 ) .",
    "observe that for real @xmath35 the functions @xmath105 thus obtained are the complex conjugates of the functions @xmath105 obtained from the choice ( [ c+ ] ) .",

    "@xmath0 reduce to ( [ c+ ] ) and ( [ c- ] ) for @xmath45 . indeed , turning to the general  @xmath0 case , our conditions on the numbers @xmath47 read as follows .",

    "indeed , from ( [ la2 ] ) we have ^*(x)=_n=1^n ( 2_n)|d^*(x+i)+|/|d^*(x)+| . now we use the restriction @xmath392 , ( [ dst ] ) and @xmath393 to obtain ^*(x ) = _ n=1^n ( 2_n)|-d(x)-c^t|/|-d(x - i)-c^t| = 1/(x ) .",
