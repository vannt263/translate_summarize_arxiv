    "it is well - known that in many practical problems , an engineer has to optimize , in one or another sense , several performance parameters of a control system . the linear quadratic optimal regulator ( lqr ) problem searches a stabilizing feedback which optimizes some associated quadratic cost functional .",
    "another important characteristic of stabilization is the exponential decay rate of the resulting closed - loop system .",
    "the main question we address in this article is to study in which situations the lqr provides good decay rates of the closed - loop system .",
    "recall that the standard linear quadratic optimal regulator problem concerns the dynamic system of the form @xmath8 the problem is to minimize the cost functional @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the state of the system and @xmath11 is a control function .",
    "matrices @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are complex and have suitable sizes .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are positive definite .",
    "we are specially interested in the case when the dimension @xmath14 of the control @xmath15 is less than @xmath16 , the dimension of the state @xmath17 .",
    "as is well - known ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , the solution to the lqr problem is unique and the function @xmath15 , for which the minimum of the cost functional is attained is given by the feedback function @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the feedback matrix and @xmath20 is any nonnegative solution of the continuous algebraic riccati equation @xmath21 this solution @xmath20 is unique and positive definite , and the minimum cost functional is given by @xmath22 .",
    "it is also notable that the feedback matrix @xmath23 does not depend on @xmath24 .",
    "the closed - loop system is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is stable , that is , its spectrum @xmath27 lies in the open left half - plane @xmath28 .",
    "we denote by @xmath29 the euclidean norm of vectors in @xmath30 and the induced norm of matrices .",
    "the linear quadratic problem is one of the most widespread methods for stabilizing systems . in this work ,",
    "we give various estimates of the quality of this stabilization in terms of the geometry of the spectrum of the open - loop system matrix @xmath3 and the characteristics of @xmath4 .",
    "we remark that the pole placement problem is known to be very ill conditioned for control systems of large size and that the linear quadratic stabilization is one of the methods for overcoming this difficulty .",
    "we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) , @xcite , @xcite and references therein for theoretical results and for a discussion of different aspects of the pole placement approach and its comparison with the linear quadratic approach to stabilization .",
    "the exponential decay rate of the closed - loop system is given by @xmath31 it is well - known that @xmath32 hence @xmath33 can be seen as a characteristic of the quality of the lq control for large times @xmath34 .",
    "the lq regulator can be considered to be good in this sense if @xmath35 is big .",
    "the main results of this article concern upper and lower estimates of @xmath33 .",
    "this is done under the assumption that the matrix @xmath3 is skew - hermitian : @xmath36 ( that is , @xmath37 is hermitian ) .",
    "this assumption just means that under the absence of control ( @xmath38 ) , the energy @xmath39 is conserved .",
    "notice that if an open - loop linear system models a mechanical ( or electrical ) system where the energy is conserved , then we are in this situation .",
    "we also will assume that @xmath40 the assumption about @xmath13 is rather natural in view of the above remark on the conservation of energy .",
    "the case of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a polynomial , reduces easily to our setting .",
    "a general matrix weight @xmath43 is converted to the the weight @xmath44 by making a linear substitution @xmath45 in .",
    "as we show , the upper and lower estimates of @xmath33 we give permit one to compare the performance of the lq optimal regulators of control systems @xmath5 , in which @xmath3 is fixed and there are several possibilities for the matrix @xmath4 .",
    "we are not aware of any previous work estimating @xmath33 for lq optimal regulators .",
    "other measures of the quality of control have been studied already . among the most popular of them",
    "are the eigenvalues of @xmath20 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "since @xmath22 , these measures are tightly related to the cost of the stabilized system .",
    "indeed , @xmath46 has the sense of the worst case performance of the cost functional , for @xmath24 of fixed norm : @xmath49 similarly , @xmath50 is the average value of @xmath51 when @xmath24 ranges over the unit sphere .",
    "the larger is any of these measures of quality of the control , the worse is the lq stabilization .",
    "estimates for all these measures are well know .",
    "see for instance the reviews by mori and derese @xcite , and kwon , moon and ahn @xcite , the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and recent papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we observe the following easy relationship : @xmath52 this inequality is true because for any @xmath53 , if @xmath54 and @xmath55 , then @xmath56 so any upper estimate of @xmath46 implies a lower estimate of @xmath33 .",
    "several works give upper bounds for @xmath46 , however , these bounds are given under assumptions that either @xmath57 or that @xmath58 is invertible .",
    "all our results deal with the case when @xmath59 and @xmath58 can be singular .",
    "notice that shows that whenever the stabilization is bad in terms of the parameter @xmath33 , @xmath46 also is large .",
    "we put @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 ) and assume throughout the whole article that @xmath62    our estimates depend on the following numbers .",
    "the characteristic @xmath63 gives the minimal separation of eigenvalues .",
    "we will write just @xmath64 when the dependence on @xmath3 is clear enough . for a fixed index @xmath65 , we put @xmath66 which denotes the separation of the eigenvalue @xmath67 of @xmath3 from the rest .",
    "the number @xmath68 will also be used .",
    "the skew - hermitian matrix @xmath3 can be diagonalized : @xmath69 where @xmath70 @xmath71 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath72 .",
    "put @xmath73    one of our main results can be stated as follows .",

    "it follows from the proof of this theorem that all its statements remain true in this case .",
    "it also follows from theorem [ thm : main ] that for @xmath83 , @xmath88 , _ independently of the choice of the @xmath89 matrix @xmath4_. we will comment more on this phenomenon at the end of section  [ mainresult ] and in section  [ sec : open - que ] , question  1 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : main - detailed ] below gives a more detailed information about the location of the spectrum of the closed - loop system .",
    "notice that the appearance of the norms of vectors @xmath90 in this estimate is very natural .",
    "in fact , the quantity @xmath91 can be taken for a kind of _ measure of controllability _ of the system @xmath92 . in the case",
    "when all eigenvalues of @xmath3 are distinct , the system is controllable if and only if @xmath93 . at the end of the introduction , we will comment on the relation between @xmath94 , the distance to uncontrollability @xmath95 , introduced by eising , and @xmath96 .",
    "if @xmath3 is not normal , then one should use eigenvectors of @xmath97 instead of eigenvectors of @xmath3 in the definition of the measure of controllability @xmath94 .",
    "we remark that if @xmath98 and for some fixed @xmath99 one can freely choose @xmath4 with @xmath100 , then an optimal control with the best possible @xmath33 can be given easily . if @xmath101 ( for example take @xmath102 ) , then the solution to the associated continuous algebraic riccati equation is @xmath103 .",
    "hence , the closed - loop system matrix is @xmath104 , and one can readily compute its eigenvalues .",
    "it follows that in this case , in the bound @xmath105 , which follows from theorem  [ thm : main ] , the equality is attained .",
    "we also observe that the case @xmath106 can be reduced to @xmath107 .",
    "in fact , the optimal feedback @xmath108 ranges over the space @xmath109 .",
    "therefore the linear quadratic problem for the pair @xmath7 reduces to the same problem for the pair @xmath110 ; notice that @xmath111 .",
    "after this reduction , in place of @xmath4 , we get the operator @xmath112 , which has trivial kernel .    for this reason",

    "in particular , corollary  [ corol - phiks ] shows that if @xmath116 is rather small , then @xmath33 is comparable with @xmath117 . in many problems of the design of optimal controllers ,",
