    "electron - positron pair production from vacuum breakdown in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields is one of the most interesting non - linear qed phenomena and at the same time a rich area of theoretical and experimental investigations@xcite .",
    "recently the possibility for an experimental verification of the phenomenon is plausible due to the rapid development of ultra - intense laser facilities @xcite .",
    "the first steps on the theoretical treatment of the phenomenon can be found @xcite , but schwinger @xcite was the first that examined it thoroughly . by the implementation of the proper time method schwinger obtained the following conditions for pair creation to occur : the invariant quantities @xmath2 , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 are the electromagnetic field tensor and its dual respectively , must be such that neither @xmath7 , @xmath8 nor @xmath9 , @xmath8 .",
    "these restrictions are for example satisfied close to the antinodes of a standing wave or at the region of a focused laser beam . in order to have sizable effects",
    "the electric field strength must exceed the critical value @xmath10 @xmath11 which corresponds to focal laser intensities of the order of @xmath12 and above .",
    "such laser intensities can be reach in the very near future from facilities such as [ 14 ] , @xcite , @xcite and xfel [ 18 ] .",
    "brezin and itzykson brezin and soon after popov @xcite used multiphoton atom ionization technics such as the imaginary time method @xcite showed that the probability of pair creation over a 4- compton volume can be obtained as @xmath13with the parameter of the theoretical treatments being  @xmath14 , which is the equivalent of keldysh parameter , the two important areas @xmath15 ( high electric field strength and low frequency , where the adiabatic non - perturbative tunneling mechanism dominates ) and @xmath16(low electric field strength and high frequency , multiphoton mechanism ) , lead respectively to the following number of pairs @xmath17 @xcite :    @xmath18    with @xmath19 being the pulse duration and @xmath20 .",
    "the first experimental verification of @xmath21 pair production took place at slac ( e-144 experiment)@xcite .",
    "highly energetic electrons ( maximum 46.6gev ) underwent nonlinear compton scattering with @xmath22 laser photons ( of @xmath23527 nm , @xmath24 and laser pulses of energy 500mj ) , @xmath25 , producing backscattered photons @xmath26 of  @xmath27  which then collide with the laser photons to produce @xmath28 , @xmath29 pairs , via the multiphoton breit -wheeler  mechanism ,  @xmath30 @xmath29 .",
    "the number of positrons measured in 21962 laser pulses was @xmath31 for a @xmath32 multiphoton order process , a result that is in very good agreement with the theory .",
    "these results have been shown in @xcite to be obtained also from popov s theory .",
    "in a recent paper avetissian et al @xcite treated @xmath21 pair production in a standing wave @xmath33 formed by oppositely directed laser beams of plane transverse linearly polarized electromagnetic waves of frequency @xmath34using a two level on resonance multiphoton approximation @xcite .",
    "the main difference between this approach and the previous one is the condition of resonance ,  which as shown in the detailed investigation presented in tmp , thesis , ploumis , tsoha , can lead to very high production efficiency .",
    "the probability density of pair creation for the case of oscillating electric field , is given in relation ( 33 ) in @xcite@xmath35this approximation will be considered in the rest of the paper . following avetissian , tmp , taking the momentum of the created electrons(positrons ) to be @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is angle between @xmath38 ( lying on the oy axis ) and @xmath39 , the probability density @xmath40and the number of pairs created @xmath41 at angle @xmath42 ( where both maximize ) for an @xmath22th order process",
    "are respectively given by @xcite    @xmath43    @xmath44    in deriving ( [ wno ] ) and ( [ npo ] ) the resonance condition @xmath45    has been used and    @xmath46    @xmath47 is the relativistic invariant parameter given by    @xmath48    @xmath49is the amplitude of one incident wave and @xmath50 for the approximation to hold .",
    "@xmath51 is the 4-compton volume of the electron , @xmath52 is the interaction volume , @xmath19 is the pulse duration , @xmath53 is the cross section radius and @xmath54 the electromagnetic wavelength avetissian , tmp .",
    "finally since in the bessel function @xmath55 , @xmath56 , the approximation @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) has to be used giving , @xmath59    as shown in @xcite , relation ( [ npo ] ) leads to very good estimates for the theory both when higher harmonics are implemented and when the range of its applicability is examined .",
    "for example for a nd - yag laser with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , intensity @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 the fifth harmonic can create approximately up to @xmath66 pairs for @xmath67 , provided that the electric field strength does not exceed the order of @xmath68 .    in section two that follows we present the use of a table top laser based x - ray free electron laser scheme for pair creation and in section three a scheme analogous to the one used in the e-144 experiment .",
    "the aim of this paper is to emphasize the advantages of using such schemes for the experimental observation of the on resonance approximation @xcite , as they can be realized in well equipped laboratory and can provide satisfactory results which we will show on our numerical estimations that will follow .",
    "one should mention that the following two setups allow the increase of electric field strength @xmath69 with a simultaneous increase of @xmath70 so that @xmath71 remains @xmath72 , as it is essential for the validity of the multiphoton on resonance approximation .",
    "in this section we investigate the use of what one could call a table top laser based x - ray free electron laser for electron positron pair creation .",
    "such system is similar to a standard x -fel system @xcite with the main difference between the two to be the electron beam creation and acceleration mechanism .",
    "the table top xfel  utilizes a relativistic electron beam produced and accelerated by a high intensity ( @xmath73 ) ultrashort laser beam@xcite .",
    "then the electron beam propagates through a wiggler system and x- ray beam is created .",
    "generation of such relativistic electron beam from a laser source can be achieved by interaction with a solid or gas target and is a wide field of research . for our purposes",
    "we consider a laser system with intensity of @xmath74 and pulse duration @xmath75 - @xmath76 recent experiments @xcite have confirmed that the accelerated electron beam can reach energies @xmath77 close to @xmath78 and charge close to @xmath79 , but is expected that in the near future this charge will become available .",
    "this beam enters an undulator with period @xmath80 and after the interaction with the magnetic field in it , x - ray photons of wavelength @xmath81will be produced , where @xmath82 is the relativistic factor @xmath83 .",
    "the undulator period for our scheme is @xmath84 but it can be adjusted depending on the x ray photon wavelength we wish to produce .    using ( [ lamda ] ) for @xmath85",
    "we obtain x - ray beam wavelength @xmath86,which corresponds to photon energy @xmath87 .",
    "two opposite directed x - ray beams form a standing wave to a circular spot  area of radius @xmath88 .",
    "the interaction 4-volume in which pair creation takes place is taken as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 .",
    "we also assume that the conversion efficiency of the electron beam energy to x - ray photons is about 10% and given the power of the electron beam @xmath91 , we obtain the energy of the x - ray beam @xmath92 . as in @xcite , with the above parameter values , we firstly investigate , using ( [ npo ] ) the dependence of pair number @xmath41 to @xmath93 ( electron rest mass units ) .",
    "the result is presented in figure 1 , where the envelope of @xmath94(@xmath95 is plotted , for @xmath96 .",
    "this optimum choice of @xmath97  ( leading to high production efficiency ) , is dictated by energy conservation between the x - ray beam energy @xmath98 and the energy @xmath99 of created pairs : one can numerically solve the energy conservation equation @xmath100 for appropriate range of values of the @xmath93 parameter ( see @xcite for a detailed analysis on the choice of @xmath71 ) .",
    "e@xmath101 pair number @xmath94 vs rest mass unit @xmath93 for @xmath102 and photon energy @xmath103,width=321 ]    the most probable pair number is the one that corresponds to @xmath104 and is of the order of @xmath105 pairs .",
    "the multiphoton order of the process as obtained by ( [ res ] ) is @xmath106 .",
    "secondly one can also investigate the dependence of @xmath94 from @xmath71 ( equivalently @xmath107 ) . using ( [ npo ] ) and the data from table 1 we present in figure 2 , the dependence of pair number @xmath41 from @xmath71 for three @xmath77 values of @xmath78 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , the last two being considered in order to estimate and compare pair creation efficiencies for energies that can be easily created with the recent technology in large laser facilities .",
    "note that in order to obtain each of the three plots in figure 2 the values of ( @xmath93 , @xmath22 ) are respectively ( 1.41 , 750 ) , ( 1.40 , 4742 ) , ( 1.40,18833 ) .",
    "vs @xmath110 for electron beam energy @xmath78 ( top curve ) , @xmath108 ( middle curve ) and @xmath111 ( bottom),width=283 ]    each one of the curves has a different ending point , because of previous mentioned energy conservation consideration .",
    "the choice of plotting vs. parameter @xmath71 is justifiable , since it depends both from the electric field strength @xmath112 and photon energy and thus allowing to investigate the dependence of @xmath113on both of these physical quantities . by adjusting the photon energy and/or the electric field one",
    "can estimate the number of produced pairs for the corresponding value of @xmath97 from figures like figure 2 .",
    "observe the very sensitivity of @xmath41 from @xmath114 which is a result of resonance approximation(this is due to the presence of the bessel function in rel ( [ npo ] ) ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table 2 .",
    "typical parameters for obtaining figure 4    the estimates of figure 4 of this scheme strongly suggest the possible use of this scheme for experimental observation of resonance approximation ( of the order of 10@xmath115for 1gev , 10@xmath116for 400 and 200 mev ) .",
    "the above analysis aims to support the experimental verification of e@xmath117 pair creation using the on resonance multiphoton approximation by presenting two possible schemes .",
    "one is based on using a table - top x - fel laser system and the second is analogous to the e144 experiment .",
    "the numerical estimates presented that a sufficient number of pairs can be produced by both schemes that can reach up to the order of  10@xmath0 pairs for the table top x - fel and 10@xmath118 for the e144 like scheme .",
    "an important fact in both proposed schemes is that they use laser based modern technology for production and acceleration of electron beam and consequently they do not need any large acceleration facilities . moreover , since the existing laser laboratories have this kind of technology , the required experimental values of the parameters needed for pair production can be achieved . our choice to carry out our numerical estimates with @xmath119 no greater than 1gev",
    "is thus justified , as electron beams with energies like 400 mev or 200  mev can be created quite easily . besides the above advantages of the two schemes",
    ", the laser beam parameters can be easily adjusted to change the electron beam energy , in order to operate on resonance .",
    "moreover the criterion for the choices of the values of the parameters used , is that they should be close to typical values rather than extreme ones , in order to maintain our estimates as realistic as possible .",
    "consequently our analysis , suggests that both of the schemes presented are promising for a future experimental verification of the on resonance pair production , especially when new powerful laser systems like x - fel@xcite , hiper@xcite and eli@xcite are under development .",
