    "this behavior is typical for uncorrelated paramagnetic moments fluctuating fast and at random.@xcite at lower temperatures , @xmath46 increases and passes through a maximum at @xmath25  k. such a characteristic enhancement has been found in numerous afm homometallic@xcite and heterometallic@xcite rings built of spins @xmath127 , but in spin-@xmath14 systems it is very rare .",
    "the only example known to us is the cu@xmath128 magnet with a high - spin @xmath129 gs.@xcite systems with predominantly afm couplings and low - spin gs ( e.g. , v@xmath19 having an @xmath130 gs , ref .  ) do not show such a feature in @xmath12 .    in homometallic rings",
    ", the maximum in @xmath46 essentially signals the slowing down of phonon - driven spin fluctuations.@xcite the equivalence between the spins ( by virtue of the nearly perfect rotation symmetry of the ring ) allows to express @xmath12 in terms of the spectral density of the total magnetic moment @xmath125 of the molecule.@xcite as shown numerically@xcite and by a microscopic theory,@xcite the phonon - driven decay of @xmath125 proceeds independently from the remaining observables of the problem , which in turn leads to a single lorentzian form for @xmath12 : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the average square of the transverse hyperfine field , @xmath133 is the nuclear larmor frequency , and @xmath134 is the decay rate of the total moment @xmath125 . the enhancement in the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath12 takes place when @xmath124 approaches the order of magnitude of @xmath133 .",
    "there are two qualitative differences between cu@xmath5-nipa  and homometallic rings that should be emphasized , though .",
    "first , cu@xmath5-nipa features a very sparse excitation spectrum ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ed ] ) , which means that there are very few spin - phonon channels available for relaxation .",
    "according to ref .",
    ", this also means that here @xmath124 is not expected to show the strong power - law @xmath135 or @xmath136 behavior .",
    "instead , one expects a much weaker @xmath97 dependence , with longer relaxational times in a wide temperature range .",
    "the second difference is the fact that the cu@xmath5 molecule comprises three inequivalent cu sites with different local magnetizations , and so the above single - lorentzian formula for @xmath12 is not valid any longer , but instead a multi - lorentzian form should be expected on general grounds , as in the case of the heterometallic cr@xmath137ni ring.@xcite    given the large spin gap , @xmath95  k , one could still argue in favor of the single - lorentzian formula of eq .   over a wide low-@xmath97 range , since the wigner - eckart theorem allows to replace individual spin operators with the total spin operators times a constant .",
    "however , such a treatment would only capture the resonant spin - phonon transitions between the two zeeman - split levels of the gs , but these transitions are prohibited by kramer s theorem . instead",
    ", for temperatures well below the spin gap @xmath95 k , the relaxation dynamics of the spins must be controlled by inter - multiplet orbach transitions@xcite between the gs doublet and the lowest magnetic excitation with the energy @xmath138 ( see below ) .",
    "again , this is quite similar to cr@xmath137ni , with the only difference that the spin gap is much smaller there ( @xmath139 k).@xcite    with the above remarks in mind , we may still use the above single - lorentzian formula for @xmath12 to extract the temperature dependence of @xmath124 , but the latter is now a representative measure of the relaxation dynamics ( as probed by nmr ) , and not necessarily the relaxation rate of the total moment . for simplicity , we have plotted @xmath140 vs. @xmath97 in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ t1 ] that clearly shows a broad maximum reflecting the slowing down of fluctuating moments .",
    "following eq .   and the procedure outlined in ref .  , we extracted @xmath124 from the @xmath140 data at @xmath141  t. the resulting @xmath97 dependence of @xmath124 ( shown in the lower inset of fig .",
    "[ t1 ] ) confirms that it is much weaker compared to the strong power - law dependence found in homometallic rings.@xcite in particular , there is a wide low-@xmath97 range over which @xmath124 follows the inter - multiplet orbach relaxation processes mentioned above . following ref .  ,",
    "@xmath142 where @xmath143  kg / m@xmath144 is the mass density,@xcite @xmath145 is the sound velocity in cu@xmath5-nipa   ( typical value @xmath146 m / sec in nanomagnets@xcite ) , and @xmath147 stands for the spin - phonon coupling energy parameter , which is related e.g. to the fluctuating portion of the dzyalozinskii - moriya interactions present in this system .",
    "note that we neglect the zeeman splitting contribution to the resonance energy , because it is negligible compared to @xmath138 . by fitting the @xmath124 data with eq .",
    ", we obtain @xmath148  k.    a more complete quantitative understanding of @xmath12 ( e.g. the high - temperature behavior and field dependence ) must take into account the multi - exponential behavior of the relaxation , discussed above , but also the presence of the wipe - out effect discussed above , see e.g. ref . .",

    "the shading shows the contribution of cu orbitals .",
    "the inset magnifies five bands at the fermi level ( @xmath149 ) , with the atomic contributions denoted by the dashed ( cu ) and solid ( o ) lines . ]    to determine individual exchange parameters in the cu@xmath5 molecule , we calculate the electronic structure of the cu@xmath5-nipa  compound .",
    "this procedure requires reliable crystallographic information , including precise positions of all atoms in the unit cell .",
    "however , the available structural data@xcite are obtained from x - ray diffraction that has only limited sensitivity to the positions of hydrogen atoms .",
