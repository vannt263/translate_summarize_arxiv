    "the existence of a charged elementary scalar particle implies necessarily an extended higgs sector beyond the standard model ( sm ) and , thus , an imprint for new physics .",
    "signals of charged elementary scalars production and effects related with such particles are an important part of the research at the colliders .",
    "this is well justified because searching for experimental proof of fundamental scalars is a necessary step to establish which of the many new proposed theories will be able to explain the experimental facts .",
    "charged scalars are part of spectrum of several models for physics beyond the sm . but",
    "the investigations realized until now have mainly been concentrated in the two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . at present ,",
    "the most stringent experimental constraints for the mass of a charged scalar , which we denote generically as the @xmath5 , comes from lep - ii and from tevatron direct searches . considering 2hdm the experiments yielded the mass constraint @xmath6 gev for the charged higgs boson , considering decays only into the channels @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xcite .",
    "for the mssm , we have the result from the cdf collaboration stating that no signal was found in the mass region @xmath9 gev @xmath10 @xmath11 gev for the charged higgs boson @xcite .",
    "the atlas and the cms collaborations have made studies about the production and detection of charged higgs considering the pair production , and the associated production with the quark top or with the charged gauge boson @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that for the lhc energy and luminosities , the charged higgses could have a significant potential for discovery .",
    "it gives additional motivation to perform analyses , in the lhc context , of charged scalars predicted by models different from the 2hdm and the mssm .",
    "interesting extensions of the sm are the class of models based on @xmath0 group , known as 3 - 3 - 1 models @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "these models have a symmetry breakdown pattern @xmath0/@xmath12 which can be connected to a scalar field condensation at the tev scale .",
    "the first proposals of these models were constructed considering three triplets of scalar fields , but a construction with two triplets of scalar fields is possible as well @xcite .",
    "taking into account the symmetry breakdown , 8 degrees of freedom from the scalars fields are incorporated as longitudinal components of the massive gauge bosons . therefore , there are more than one physical scalar left in the particle spectrum of these models , with at least one charged state . the characteristics of the charged scalars , like electric charge and couplings , depend on the specific model version .",
    "detailed analysis of the interactions and production are then crucial in order to validated or rule out some of these models .",
    "besides coinciding with the sm at low energies , these models have several attractive features .",
    "some of them are the following : the anomalies cancellation occur only when the number of generations are a multiple of three , and assuming asymptotic freedom in qcd it is concluded that there must be three generations ; the @xmath1 symmetry restricts the electroweak mixing angle @xmath13 , furnishing a hint for an explanation of its value , since @xmath14 in the models of refs .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath15 in the models of refs .",
    "@xcite ; also , quantization of the electric charge can be explained in the context of these models @xcite .    these and other features have motivated many studies concerning the 3 - 3 - 1 models .",

    "are taken into account . in principle , those triplets may form several invariant operators through multiplication resulting in a great set of free parameters . in face of it we , additionally , impose a sort of global custodial symmetry which reduces the number of free parameters in the scalar potential @xcite .",
    "our main goal was to investigate in the 3 - 3 - 1rhn the lightest charged higgs boson production at hadron colliders .",
    "we analyzed several production channels of phenomenological interest including higgs pairs , associated production to @xmath16 bosons , associated production to top quarks , and from top quark decay .",
    "as a result we find that the cross sections for all these processes are at least as high as the mssm analogues .",
    "the presence of the new gauge boson @xmath2 of the model affects some of the production processes that we have studied endowing the model some distinguishing features compared to other standard model extensions .",
    "in particular , we found that the process @xmath17+@xmath18 at the 14 tev lhc allows , through a reconstruction analysis , a clear identification of the charged higgs boson decaying to a top and a bottom quark .",

    "its magnitude is comparable to the top pairs production @xcite . the charged higgs pair production ( 1 ) , by its turn , can be substantial for large @xmath120 combining all contributing channels and after including nlo corrections @xcite .",
    "the mode ( 2 ) can also occur in the mssm and 2hdm models via t - channel yukawa diagrams involving top and bottom quarks , and through s - channel neutral higgs bosons @xcite . on the other hand , in the 3 - 3 - 1 models , or in models with extended gauge sectors ,",
    "a new contribution is possible : through the production and subsequent decay of a new neutral gauge boson @xmath2 . in our 3 - 3 - 1 model",

    "in the next we discuss each production channel presented above in more detail .",
    "all computations of this work were performed at tree level using the madgraph / madevent package @xcite and the signals were checked against calchep / comphep @xcite .",
    "higher order corrections were not taken into account but we comment the expected impact of qcd corrections wherever we find it is enlightening . the cteq6l structure functions @xcite were used for the calculation of all signals and backgrounds .",

    "anyway , any cancellation would reduce the production rates which will not spoil our conclusions .",
    "charged higgs bosons can be produced in pairs through light and bottom quark annihilation and gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "the later channel receives contributions from loop diagrams with virtual heavy quarks , and the higgses are produced via yukawa interactions to these heavy states . in principle , all heavy quarks predicted by the theory contribute to the amplitude , however based on the mssm case @xcite , where the gluon fusion channel contributes significantly only for rather large @xmath120 , we assume we can neglect that channel for the computation of total cross sections presenting conservative results .",
    "the drell - yan annihilation to neutral gauge bosons and subsequent decay to higgs pairs is the main production channel .",

    "[ fig : drell - yan ] .",
    "as soon as the twice of the higgs mass exceeds the @xmath2 mass the rates drop sharply and the bottom initiated process drives the production rates .",
    "the bottom t - channel contribution involves the enhanced yukawa @xmath127 interaction which may compete with the drell - yan channel depending on the mass of the charged higgs .",
    "nevertheless , the bottom density is populated for small x in the proton sea , and the production of heavy states is less likely from this channel .",
    "it is worth noting that the expected rate for the mssm charged higgs pair production including nlo qcd barely reaches 100 fb for @xmath128 , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite including all possible contribution channels with little sensitivity to the specific parameter space point .",
    "the prospects to search for charged higgses in the pair production channel was established by the cms and atlas collaborations @xcite @xcite , in special the charged scalars predicted by the 2hdm and the mssm @xcite , @xcite will be hard to detect .",

    "the top quark , the @xmath16 boson , and the charged higgs resonances make the task to separate the signal from backgrounds relatively simple , and as a consequence a large portion of the parameters space of the model will be accessible to the 14 tev lhc collaborations with up to @xmath225 , and even a @xmath219 integrated luminosity would be just enough to discover a charged higgs boson .",
    "we found that the same conclusion can not be claimed for the 7 tev lhc and the tevatron because of the reduced amount of data designed for these experiments .",
    "nevertheless the lighter charged higgs , @xmath121 , decays predominantly to tau leptons and if the @xmath2 is not too heavy this channel might be a good search channel for the tevatron or even a 7 tev lhc in a longer run .",
    "we did not try to optimize our analyses for very specific points of the parameters space , instead we focused on a more or less blind set of cuts taking into account only acceptance , trigger and tagging techniques .",
    "the robustness of the analyses shows up as signal to background ratio greater than 1 for a large portion of the parameters space under study in this work .",
    "detailed studies can be made though in order to take advantage of the hard jets and leptons expected for even heavier @xmath2 and charged higgses .",
