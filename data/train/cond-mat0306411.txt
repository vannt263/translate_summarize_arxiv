    "as one of the most remarkable macroscopic quantum phenomena , superfluidity has attracted enormous attention since its discovery@xcite .",
    "the realization of bose - einstein condensation in dilute atomic gases@xcite has provided physicists a new fertile ground for exploring many aspects of this fascinating phenomenon , including frictionless current@xcite and vortices @xcite . in particular ,",
    "there has been increasing interests and efforts to study superfluidity and related phenomena in the system of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in an optical lattice , such as landau - zener tunneling@xcite , josephson effect@xcite , and dynamical instability@xcite .",
    "recently , quantum phase transition between superfluidity and mott - insulator@xcite was observed in such a system .",
    "superflow of bec in an optical lattice is represented by a bloch wave , which can be regarded as a plane wave modulated by the periodic potential .",
    "bloch waves and bloch bands are the basic language and concepts in periodic systems .",
    "they are also essential to the study of superfluidity and many of its related phenomena in this periodic bec system .",
    "one interesting phenomenon is the tunneling between bloch bands at the edge of the brillouin zone .",
    "previously , people studied experimentally this inter - band tunneling by dragging cold atoms with accelerated optical lattices@xcite .",
    "the cold atoms are very dilute and the interaction between them can be ignored entirely . it is then curious to know how the tunneling will change if the cold atoms are replaced with a bec , where the atomic density is relatively large and the interaction between atoms can no longer be neglected .",
    "our study shows that the interaction will increase the tunneling probability in general@xcite .",
    "when the repulsive interaction is over a critical value , a loop appears in the lowest bloch band , resulting in non - zero tunneling probability even in the adiabatic limit@xcite .",
    "this breakdown of adiabaticity is the result of superfluidity and can be viewed as a hysteresis phenomenon@xcite .",
    "the most dramatic manifestation of superfluidity is that the boson system can maintain its current speed in a very tight space , such as a narrow capillary .",
    "landau proposed a criterion for superfluidity@xcite : if the current moves slower than sound , it experiences no viscosity ; otherwise , the system suffers an instability and loses its speed . in a homogeneous bec ,",
    "the sound speed is proportional to the square root of the bec density .",
    "it is not clear how superfluidity can be defined and studied for a bec in an optical lattice .",
    "our method is to examine the energy dispersion of bloch waves .",
    "when the bloch waves are energy minima of the system , they represent superflows ; when the bloch waves are energy saddle points , they suffer landau instability : external disturbances can render the system to emit phonons thus reduce its speed .",
    "the bec bloch waves can be dynamically unstable , that is , the system diverges away from the original bloch state upon small instantaneous perturbation@xcite .",
    "this instability does not exist either for a bec in a free space or for a free particle in a periodic lattice ; it happens only when there are both interaction and periodic lattice .",
    "the dynamical instability has been observed experimentally@xcite , and further confirmed by other theoretical studies and experimental observations@xcite .",
    "this dynamical instability is quite a general phenomenon and widely exists in other systems , such as a bec confined in a ring@xcite .",
    "its general implication and relation to superfluidity will be discussed in this review .",
    "we will discuss these phenomena in detail and review many interesting results for the quasi - one dimensional case , where the optical lattice is created by two counter - propagating off - resonance lasers while the lateral motion of the bec can be either ignored or confined@xcite . in section ii , a brief introduction of the mean - field theory of bec systems is given for the sake of completeness and introduction of the notations . in section iii , we define bloch waves and bloch bands for becs in optical lattices and present some general results and the numerical methods to find them . in section iv , we simplify the system to a two - level model to study the tunneling between bloch bands .",
    "we point out the tunneling in the adiabatic limit is related to a general problem , adiabatic evolution of nonlinear quantum states . in section",
    "v , the landau instability and dynamical instability of the bloch waves are studied .",
    "other approaches to superfluidity and experimental observation and general implication of dynamical instability are discussed . finally in section",
    "vi , we summarize the paper .",
    "even though the bec is quite dense compared to the cold atoms , it is still very dilute with typical densities at @xmath0m@xmath1 , which is thousands of times more dilute than the air . due to this diluteness , along with the extreme low temperature , the interaction between atoms can be characterized by the @xmath2-wave scattering and modeled with a @xmath3-function .",
    "when the number of atoms is large , the bec system is very well described by the mean - field theory given by the celebrated gross - pitaevskii equation@xcite [ eq : nls0 ] i=-^22m^2x^2+v(x)+4 ^ 2a_sm||^2 , where @xmath4 is the atomic mass , @xmath5 is the @xmath2-wave scattering length , and @xmath6 is the external potential imposed on the system . in our case , the potential is the optical lattice created by two laser beams and is given by v(x)=v_0(2k_l x ) , where @xmath7 is proportional to the laser intensity and @xmath8 is the wave number of the laser .    for simplicity , we will instead use the following dimensionless gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation [ eq : nls ] it=-12 ^ 2x^2 + v(x)+c||^2 . in the above equation ,",
    "all the variables are scaled to be dimensionless with the system s basic parameters : the strength of the periodic potential @xmath9 is in units of @xmath10 , the wave function @xmath11 in units of @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the averaged bec density , @xmath14 in units of @xmath15 , @xmath16 in units of @xmath17 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath18 .",
    "this system can also be regarded as a hamiltonian system governed by the grand canonical hamiltonian [ eq : h ] h = x  \\{^*(-12 ^2x^2+v(x))+c2||^4-||^2 } , where @xmath19 is the chemical potential .",
    "the gp equation ( [ eq : nls ] ) can be obtained by variation of the hamiltonian , @xmath20 .",
    "among all possible solutions of eq.([eq : nls ] ) , there are states which extremize the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) and hence satisfy the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation [ eq : nlsi ] -12d^2d",
    "x^2 + c||^2+v(x)=. we call these extremum states nonlinear eigenstates , which are also called nonlinear coherent modes elsewhere@xcite ; accordingly , @xmath19 are nonlinear eigenvalues .",
    "bloch waves are the nonlinear eigenstates of the following form [ eq : bloch ] ( x)=e^ikx_k(x ) , where @xmath21 is a periodic function of period @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the bloch wave number .",
    "in particular , from eq.([eq : nlsi ] ) we have the following equation for each bloch wave state @xmath24 [ eq : nlsp ] -12(dd x+ik)^2_k + c|_k|^2_k+v(x)_k=(k)_k .",
    "the set of eigenvalues @xmath25 then form bloch bands .    when @xmath26 , the plane waves are the solutions of eq.([eq : nlsi ] ) , and they represent a bec flow with speed of @xmath23 . as is well known , when the speed is smaller than the speed of sound , @xmath27 , it is a superflow ; when @xmath28 , it develops a landau instability and loses the superfluidity .",
    "bloch waves are the counterpart of these plane waves in a periodic system . whether these bloch waves represent superflows or not is determined by the energy dispersion of these bloch waves as we will show later .    in the linear case ,",
    "@xmath29 , all eigenstates are bloch waves@xcite .",
    "the situation is very different for the periodic nonlinear system , where it is possible to have non - bloch wave eigenstates .",
    "furthermore , there are nonlinear bloch waves that do not have their linear counterparts .",
    "here is a beautiful example@xcite .",
    "eq.([eq : nlsi ] ) has an exact solution of bloch wave at the brillouin zone edge @xmath30 , [ eq : exact ] = + 2e^ix2- -2e^-ix2 .",
    "this bloch wave state only exists when @xmath31 so that it has no linear counterpart .",
    "this shows that there are some `` extra '' nonlinear bloch waves when the nonlinearity is strong enough .",
    "their corresponding `` extra '' eigenvalues should make the nonlinear bloch band look very different from the linear bloch band .",
    "this is indeed the case : our numerical results show a loop structure in the lowest bloch band when @xmath32 as seen in fig.[fig : bband ] .",
    "this loop structure was first found in ref.@xcite with a two - mode approximation , then confirmed in ref.@xcite . in particular , in ref.@xcite , a loop is also found for the second band at the brillouin zone center .    this loop structure is a consequence of superfluidity .",
    "one clear indication is that the exact bloch wave at the brillouin zone edge , eq.([eq : exact ] ) , represents a flow of non - zero speed , @xmath33@xcite .",
    "this is quite remarkable if we recall that all the bloch waves at the zone edge carry no currents in the linear case .",
    "for a free particle , the flow @xmath34 is completely stopped due to first - order bragg scattering by the periodic potential , leading a zero - current bloch waves at the edge , @xmath30 . however , when the superfluidity gets stronger , that is , when @xmath32 , the flow @xmath34 can no longer be stopped by bragg scattering , yielding a zone - edge bloch wave that carries a current",
    ". the connection between superfluidity and the loop structure is discussed in - depth in the context of hysteresis by mueller@xcite .",
    "these bloch states can be prepared experimentally , at least for the ones in the lowest bloch band by adiabatic control . for a trapped cigar - shaped bec , we slowly turn on an optical lattice along its longitudinal direction ; we then have a bec in the bloch state at the center of the brillouin zone .",
    "other bloch states can be achieved by accelerating the lattice for a certain amount of time .",
    "these experimental techniques of adiabatic turning - on and accelerating optical lattices have been demonstrated successfully with either cold atoms@xcite or becs@xcite .",
    "there are several numerical methods to find the bloch wave @xmath24 .",
    "the method described in ref.@xcite is to expand @xmath24 in fourier series and minimize the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) in the space expanded by fourier coefficients .",
    "another one is used in ref.@xcite , where eq.([eq : nlsi ] ) is first solved for different values of @xmath19 and @xmath23 then the bloch band @xmath25 is found by interpolation .    a much better method is the following .",
    "one still starts with the expansion of @xmath24 in fourier series , _",
    "k(x)=_n =- n^na_i e^inx , where @xmath35 is the cut - off . with the substitution of the above equation into eq.([eq : nlsp ] ) ,",
    "one obtains @xmath36 equalities for the coefficients of each fourier term @xmath37 , f_n(a_0,a_1,,a_n,)=0 .",
    "finally , the bloch wave is found by minimizing the following sum s=_n =- n^n f_n^2 .",
    "the results in fig.[fig : bband ] are obtained with this method by using @xmath38 .",
    "consider the scenario that we drag the bec across the entire brillouin zone with an accelerating lattice .",
    "if the bec is initially in a bloch state belonging to the lowest bloch band and the acceleration is small enough , the system will stay in the band and undergo bloch oscillations@xcite .",
    "as one increases the acceleration , the bec will have increasing chance tunneling into the upper band at the edge of the brillouin zone , where the band gap is the smallest . without interaction , this tunneling is nothing but the famous landau - zener tunneling@xcite , a well understood phenomenon . with the interaction in our case , the tunneling behavior",
    "is strongly modified , in particular , by the loop structure in the bloch band as we will see later .    in an accelerating lattice ,",
    "the system is described by [ eq : nlsa ] it=-12 ( x+it)^2+v(x)+c||^2 , where @xmath39 is the acceleration . even in the linear case ,",
    "@xmath29 , the above equation is difficult to analyze . to reduce the mathematical complexity , we will approximate it with a two - level model without losing the essential physics .",
    "the tunneling mainly occurs around the edge of the brillouin zone , @xmath30 , where the wave function is dominated by two plane wave components .",
    "we zoom in on this region and write @xmath40 where @xmath41 . following the simple algebra described in ref.@xcite by substituting the above two - mode wave function into eq.([eq : nlsa ] ) , we obtain a two - level nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath42 where @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    ".    however simplified it may appear , this two - level model captures the essence of our bec system as it reproduces the looped bloch band ( see fig.[fig : loop2 ] ) . in this simple model ,",
    "the `` bloch bands '' are obtained by finding the eigenvalues of @xmath46 , h()= ( ) . the eigenvalues @xmath47 are also called adiabatic energy levels .",
    "how the levels change with the coupling strength @xmath48 is shown in fig.[fig : loop2 ] , where we again see the appearance of the loop for @xmath32 in the lower energy level .",
    "for this two - level model , the original tunneling problem in the bec system can be restated as follows : if the system starts in the lower level , as the energy bias @xmath49 changes with the sweeping rate @xmath39 from the far negative end to the far positive end , what is probability that the system ends up in the upper level ?    when @xmath29 , this is precisely the well - known landau - zener model , which can be solved exactly .",
    "the tunneling probability is@xcite @xmath50 it is clear from this formula that , in the adiabatic limit @xmath51 , the tunneling probability is zero , that is , the system stays in the lower level throughout the entire process .",
    "this is nothing but a special case of the quantum adiabatic theorem@xcite : in the adiabatic change of a parameter the system starting in an eigenstate stays in the same instantaneous eigenstate .",
    "when @xmath32 , this adiabaticity is broken down by the loop structure : suppose we start with a state on the lower adiabatic level , and move it up along the branch by changing @xmath49 so slowly such that little tunneling to the upper level is generated .",
    "after passing the crossing point @xmath52 , the state remains in the course moving up in energy until hitting the terminal point @xmath53 , where it has no way to go any further except to jump to the upper and lower levels .",
    "this leads to a nonzero probability tunneling into the upper level in the adiabatic limit .",
    "this qualitative analysis is corroborated by our numerical integration of eq.([eq : twolevel ] ) .",
    "the tunneling probabilities as a function of the sweeping rate @xmath39 are plotted in fig.[fig : rate ] for different values of @xmath48 at @xmath54 . in general , the tunneling probability is enhanced due to the interaction .",
    "however , its dependence on @xmath39 changes dramatically with the increasing interaction strength @xmath48 .",
    "when @xmath55 , the tunneling probability approaches zero in the adiabatic limit , @xmath51 .",
    "it appears that the approaching is exponential , as supported by a recent analysis@xcite . at the critical point ,",
    "@xmath56 , the tunneling probability still turns to zero as the sweeping slows down , however , not exponentially .",
    "when @xmath48 is over the critical value , it becomes apparent in fig.[fig : rate ] that the tunneling curve tends to intersect the vertical axis at a finite value , indicating the tunneling probability is not zero at the adiabatic limit , @xmath51 .",
    "of course , one can never be absolutely sure that the tunneling probability at @xmath51 is not zero by numerical calculation since there is always a limit on the smallness of @xmath39 in a computer code .",
    "this uncertainty is put to an end in ref.@xcite , where this nonzero adiabatic tunneling probability is obtained analytically .",
    "one can also directly integrate numerically the original schrdinger equation eq.([eq : nlsa ] ) to find out the tunneling probability and how it depends on the acceleration @xmath39 .",
    "this is done in ref.@xcite , where one sees a similar crossover from the exponential to non - exponential dependence of the tunneling probability on @xmath39 .",
    "we argue that this crossover behavior can serve as an indirect evidence of the existence of the loop structure in the bloch band .",
    "we believe that this crossover should be observable in an experiment similar to the one conducted in ref.@xcite .",
    "the nonlinear landau - zener tunneling studied here is likely as general as the linear counterpart and should exist in many physical systems .",
    "we found one example in molecular magnets@xcite , where the jamming effect among interacting molecular spins is the result of nonlinear landau - zener tunneling .      the nonlinear two - level model ( [ eq : twolevel ] ) is a very good example of a general problem : how a nonlinear quantum system , such as a bec system , responses to the change of a system parameter .",
    "of particular interest is that the parameter change is adiabatic since the adiabatic control is an important tool in preparing a quantum system ( linear or nonlinear ) into a desired quantum state @xcite . for a linear quantum system , the answer is the quantum adiabatic theorem , which can be found in a standard textbook@xcite .",
    "the theorem states that if the system is initially in a non - degenerate eigenstate , it stays in the same eigenstate as the parameter changes adiabatically .    on the other hand , the answer for nonlinear quantum systems is not as straightforward .",
    "the nonlinearity proves to be a big obstacle for generalizing the linear quantum adiabatic theorem@xcite .",
    "very non - trivial modifications to the linear case are expected as it is found in the nonlinear two - level model ( [ eq : twolevel ] ) that tunneling between energy levels happens even in the adiabatic limit .    in a recent paper@xcite , we have successfully generalized the quantum adiabatic theorem to nonlinear quantum systems by combining ideas from classical adiabatic dynamics and quantum geometric phases .",
    "it is found that the eigenstates correspond to fixed points of an equivalent classical problem .",
    "the adiabatic evolution of these eigenstates depends on the nature of the corresponding fixed points .",
    "if the fixed point is elliptic , the system can stay in the same eigenstate as in the linear case . otherwise ,",
    "when the fixed point is hyperbolic , the system will stray away from the eigenstate , leading to tunneling between different eigenstates .",
    "this adiabatic condition can also be specified in terms of bogoliubov spectrum .",
    "if the bogoliubov spectrum is real , the adiabaticity is kept ; otherwise , it is broken .",
    "a quantum bose liquid or gas at very low temperatures possesses a very remarkable property known as superfluidity : its flows suffers no viscosity through capillaries or other types of tight spaces when its speed is slower than a critical value .",
    "this was discovered even before the conception of bose - einstein condensation@xcite .",
    "landau@xcite gave a simple explanation for this intriguing phenomenon .",
    "he argued that , a quantum current suffers friction only when the system s elementary excitation , phonon , can lower its energy . with the galilean transformation",
    ", he found that a quantum liquid flowing with a speed smaller than the sound speed enjoys such frictionless transport .",
    "when it flows with a speed larger than the sound speed , the quantum liquid can lower its energy by emitting phonons , leading to the slowdown of its speed .",
    "such lose of superfluidity can also be regarded as an instability : the system can no longer stay in its original state thus keep its flow against perturbation of the roughness of capillaries or other external disturbance .",
    "we will call this instability landau instability . note that this landau instability is different from the landau instability discussed in plasma physics @xcite .    in our case , the study of superfluidity or landau instability is complicated by the presence of the optical lattice , which breaks the translational symmetry along its flow direction and modulates the bec density .",
    "this complication is only mathematical .",
    "the physics is still the same , that is , the landau instability is determined by whether the elementary excitation around a bec flow lowers the system s energy or not .",
    "if it does not , the bec flow is a local energy minimum of the system and it is a superflow .",
    "otherwise , the flow is an energy saddle point and it suffers landau instability ( see fig.[fig : landyn ] ) .    whether these bloch waves are local energy minima is determined by their energy dispersions . to calculate the dispersion , we perturb the system around a bloch state [ eq : pert ] ( x)=e^ikx . due to the periodicity of our system and the bloch waves",
    ", these perturbation can be decomposed into different modes labeled by @xmath57 , _",
    "k(x , q ) = u_k(x , q)e^iqx+v_k^*(x , q)e^-iqx , where @xmath57 is also a kind of bloch wave number and ranges between @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the perturbation functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 are of periodicity of @xmath22 in @xmath14 . by substituting the perturbed state ( [ eq : pert ] ) into the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h])and neglecting terms of orders higher than two , we obtain a quadratic form of the energy deviation , which is block diagonal in @xmath57 .",
    "each block is given by e_k=_-^dx m_k(q ) , [ eq : approx ] where [ eq : mmatrix ] m_k(q)= , with ( k)=-12(x + ik)^2 + v(x)-+2c|_k|^2 .",
    "if @xmath62 is positive definite for all @xmath63 , the bloch wave @xmath24 is a local minimum and represents a superflow .",
    "otherwise , @xmath64 can be negative for some @xmath57 , indicating that the bloch wave is a saddle point and describes only a normal flow .",
    "the special case @xmath26 , when the optical lattice is turned off , is the simple case considered by landau@xcite . in this case",
    ", the bloch state @xmath24 becomes a plane wave @xmath65 and the operator @xmath62 becomes a @xmath66 matrix m_k(q)= whose eigenvalues are [ eq : lambda ] _ = q^22+c . since @xmath67 is always positive , the matrix @xmath62 is not positive definite only when @xmath68 , or equivalently , @xmath69 .",
    "it immediately follows that the bec flow @xmath65 becomes a saddle point when the flow speed exceeds the sound speed , @xmath70 .",
    "this recovers exactly the landau condition for the breakdown of superfluidity @xcite , which has recently been confirmed experimentally on bec @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated in the case of @xmath71 , when the optical lattice is turned on .",
    "we resort to numerical calculations to examine whether the matrices @xmath62 are positive definite and the corresponding bec bloch waves are local energy minima .",
    "our focus is on the bloch states in the lowest bloch band , excluding the loop .",
    "the results are summarized in the stability phase diagrams in fig.[fig : kq ] , where a wide range of values of @xmath9 and @xmath48 are considered in order to give a global picture of how the instabilities change with the two system parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath9 .",
    "the results have reflection symmetry in @xmath23 and @xmath57 , so we only show the parameter region , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    in the shaded area ( light or dark ) of each panel of fig.[fig : kq ] the matrix @xmath62 has negative eigenvalues , and the corresponding bloch states @xmath24 are saddle points .",
    "for those values of @xmath23 outside the shaded area , the bloch states are local energy minima and represent superflows .",
    "the superflow region expands with increasing atomic interaction @xmath48 , and occupies the entire brillouin zone for sufficiently large @xmath48 . on the other hand ,",
    "the lattice potential strength @xmath9 does not affect the superflow region very much as we see in each row .",
    "the phase boundaries for @xmath74 are well reproduced from the analytical expression @xmath75 for @xmath26 , which is plotted as triangles in the first column .",
    "the landau instability of the states in the lower branch of the loop has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is found that the area of superfluidity increases when the interaction @xmath48 increases or the lattice strength @xmath9 decreases .",
    "so far , we have been identifying superfluidity as stability in the sense of landau@xcite . in this approach",
    ", there is an implicit assumption that the boson system has already achieved phase coherence and can be described by a complex order parameter , the macroscopic wave function .",
    "whether the state described by the macroscopic wave function possesses superfluidity is then examined by how the system responses to perturbations . with the assumption of phase coherence ,",
    "this approach is not well - equipped to study quantum phase transitions at zero temperature , such as the superfluid - mott - insulator transition@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this approach can still provide some signals for the onset of some possible phase transition as we will discuss in the context of dynamical instability in the next section .",
    "there are various other approaches to superfluidity .",
    "one of particular interest was proposed by fisher _",
    "_ in ref.@xcite , where superfluidity is defined as how strong the system is affected by an artificially imposed phase - twist at boundaries .",
    "since only the superfluid part of the system responses to the phase - twist , by calculating the change of the system energy , one can find out the superfluid fraction of the bose system .",
    "this approach has its root in the josephson effect , where the phase coherence aspect of superfluidity was exposed for the first time@xcite .",
    "this phase - twist approach does not assume the phase coherence ; to the opposite , it is particularly designed to calculate how much phase coherence a system has .",
    "it has been widely used in the bose - hubbard model to study the superfluid - mott - insulator transition@xcite . with the recognition that a bec in an optical lattice can be described by the bose - hubbard model@xcite",
    ", this approach has now been adopted to study the superfluid - mott - insulator transition for various systems of becs in optical lattices@xcite .",
    "both approaches are of perturbative nature , that is , they study how the bose system responses to small perturbations . in the landau s approach ,",
    "all possible disturbances are considered ; one is able to determine the robustness of a superfluid as measured by the critical velocity . in contrast , a special type of perturbation is considered in the method of phase - twist , namely , an artificial phase twist imposed at the boundaries .",
    "this perturbation is sensitive to the interplay between kinetic energy and interaction .",
    "it is not clear how this phase twisting corresponds to usual perturbations ( such as disorder or roughness ) which would degrade the flow of a normal fluid . in short ,",
    "the relation between these two pictures is still a subject of active debate@xcite .",
    "one unique feature in the system of becs in optical lattices is dynamical instability , which does not exist in the absence of either atomic interaction , @xmath29 , or an optical lattice , @xmath26 .",
    "many of the bec bloch waves can be dynamically unstable against certain perturbation modes @xmath57 only when both factors are present . by dynamical instability , we mean that small deviations from a state grow exponentially in the course of time evolution ( see fig.[fig : landyn ] ) .",
    "the dynamical instability can be determined from the linear stability analysis of the gp equation eq.([eq : nls ] ) .",
    "assume that the system experience a small disturbance @xmath76 at a bloch state , ( x , t)=e^ikx - it , where the disturbance can be similarly written as _ k(x , q ) = u_k(x , q , t)e^iqx+v_k^*(x , q , t)e^-iqx . plugging the above wave function into eq.([eq : nls ] ) and keeping only the linear terms , we arrive at a linear dynamical equation , [ eq : first ] it=_z m_k(q ) , where _ z=. the eigenvalues @xmath77 of the matrix @xmath78 determine the dynamical instability : if they are real for all @xmath79 , the bloch state is dynamically stable ; if otherwise , that is , some of them are complex , it is dynamically unstable .",
    "one who is familiar with the quasi - particle excitation in quantum fluid may immediately notice that @xmath78 also appears in the bogoliubov approach and gives us the spectrum of the phonon excitation@xcite . when all of its eigenvalues @xmath77 are real , the positive half are the phonon spectrum while the other half are deemed non - physical .",
    "however , we will refer to the modes corresponding to the negative half as anti - phonons for the sake of easy reference in the following discussion .",
    "again , we first look at the case @xmath26 , where the eigenvalues of @xmath78 are [ eq : epsilon ] _",
    "( q)=kq . these eigenvalues are always real , implying that the bec flows in a free space are always dynamically stable .",
    "when @xmath80 , the situation is totally different : the eigenvalues @xmath77 of @xmath78 can be complex and bloch states can be dynamically unstable .",
    "the results are summarized in fig.[fig : kq ] , where these @xmath77 are complex in the dark - shaded areas .",
    "the dark shaded areas lie completely inside the light shaded areas , as the result of a rigorous conclusion that only saddle - point bloch states can have dynamical instability .",
    "its proof is given in the appendix .",
    "the dynamical instability is the result of the resonance coupling between a phonon mode and an anti - phonon mode by first - order bragg scattering .",
    "as shown in the appendix , the matrix @xmath78 is real in the momentum representation , meaning its complex eigenvalue can appear only in conjugate pairs and they must come from a pair of real eigenvalues that are degenerate prior to the coupling . degeneracies or resonances within the phonon spectrum or within the anti - phonon spectrum do not give rise to dynamical instability ; they only generate gaps in the spectra .",
    "based on this general conclusion , we have analyzed dynamical instability for two extreme limits , @xmath74 and @xmath81 .",
    "the limit , @xmath74 , corresponds to the cases shown in the first column of fig.[fig : kq ] . for this limit , we can approximate the phonon spectrum and the anti - phonon spectrum with the ones given in eq.([eq : epsilon ] ) . by equating them ,",
    "@xmath82 , for the degeneracy , we find that the dynamical instability should occur on the following curves [ eq : kqc ] k=+ .",
    "these curves are plotted as solid dots in fig.[fig : kq ] , and they fall right in the middle of the thin dark - shaded areas . to some extent , one can regard these thin dark - shaded areas as broadening of the curves ( [ eq : kqc ] ) .",
    "it is noted in ref.@xcite that the relation ( [ eq : kqc ] ) is also the result of @xmath83 , which involves only the physical phonons .",
    "therefore , the physical meaning of eq.([eq : kqc ] ) is that one can excite a pair of phonons with total energy zero and with total momentum equal to a reciprocal wave number of the lattice .",
    "the other limit , @xmath81 , is the cases plotted the first row of fig.[fig : kq ] .",
    "the open circles along the left edges of these dark - shaded areas are given by [ eq : bb ] e_1(k+q)-e_1(k)=e_1(k)-e_1(k - q ) where @xmath84 is the lowest bloch band of h_0=-12 ^ 2x^2+v(x ) .",
    "in this linear periodic system , the excitation spectrum ( phonon or anti - phonon ) just corresponds to transitions from the bloch states of energy @xmath84 to other bloch states of energy @xmath85 , or vise versa .",
    "the above equation is just the resonance condition between such excitations in the lowest band ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "alternatively , we can write the resonance condition as e_1(k)+e_1(k)=e_1(k+q)+e_1(k - q ) .",
    "so , this condition may be viewed as the energy and momentum conservation for two particles interacting and decaying into two different bloch states @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this is the same physical picture behind eq.([eq : kqc ] ) .",
    "one common feature of all the diagrams in fig.[fig : kq ] is that there is a critical bloch wave number @xmath89 beyond which the bloch waves @xmath24 are dynamically unstable .",
    "the onset instability at @xmath89 always corresponds to @xmath90 . in other words , if we drive the bloch state @xmath24 from @xmath91 to @xmath30 the first unstable mode appearing is always @xmath92 , which represents period doubling . only for",
    "@xmath93 can longer wavelength instabilities occur .",
    "the growth of these unstable modes drives the system far away from the bloch state and spontaneously breaks the translational symmetry of the system .",
    "the dynamical instability of the lower loop states is studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "the range of @xmath23 , where dynamical instability occurs , is found decreasing with increasing @xmath48 and decreasing @xmath9 .",
    "we have so far presented a theory of how to determine the landau and dynamical instabilities for the system of becs in optical lattices .",
    "it is valid for the full ranges of parameters @xmath48 and @xmath9 as long as the mean - field treatment is adequate .",
    "it is , nevertheless , worthwhile to consider the system in certain extreme limits , where analytical results are available .",
    "the particular limit that we now look into is the tight - binding limit , where the lattice is so strong that the bec system can be considered as a chain of trapped becs that are weakly linked .",
    "this limit was studied in ref.@xcite with its focus on dynamical instability . in this case , the bec trapped in each well of the lattice can be approximately described by _",
    "n(x)=^0(x-2n ) , where the real wave function @xmath94 is very localized in the well @xmath95 $ ] such that dx_n(x)_m(x)_mn .",
    "the tight - binding approximation is to write ( x , t)=_n",
    "w_n(t)_n(x ) . substituting it into the gp equation ( [ eq : nls ] ) , we find after neglecting a trivial energy constant@xcite , [ eq : tight ] i =- t(w_n+1+w_n-1)+u|w_n|^2w_n , where t = dx ( + _ n_n+1v(x ) ) , and u = dx_n^4(x ) .",
    "no surprise , the tight - binding equation ( [ eq : tight ] ) has also a bloch wave solution [ eq : tbloch ] w^k_n= with @xmath96 .",
    "the instabilities of this bloch wave solution can be determined by following precisely the method described in the previous subsections .",
    "we write down the perturbed state w_n(t)=w_n^k(t)+(ue^2iqn+v^*e^-2iqn)e^i2kn - t . which leads to an m matrix ( similar to eq.([eq : mmatrix ] )",
    "m_k(q)=. in the matrix , l(k+q)=u+4t(q ) . by straightforward calculations , we find the eigenvalues of @xmath62 _",
    "k(q)=u+4t^2(q)(2k ) + , and the bogoliubov spectrum ( eigenvalues of @xmath78 ) _",
    "k(q)=2t(2q)(2k)2(q ) + . based on these two results",
    ", one can easily determine the stability phase diagram of the bloch wave solution ( [ eq : tbloch ] ) , which is plotted in fig.[fig : tight ] .",
    "when @xmath97 , there is a right border line for dynamical instability ( see the top right corner of fig.[fig : tight](a ) ) ; it is given by ^2(q)= ,  k>. this border disappears for @xmath98 .",
    "for any value of @xmath99 , the left border of dynamical instability is at @xmath100 for any @xmath57 while the boundary of landau instability is described by ^2(q)=(2k)(+(2k ) ) ,  k. note that the border line @xmath100 is consistent with our analysis in the last subsection .",
    "it is the result of eq.([eq : bb ] ) when one uses the tight - binding band energy @xmath101 .",
    "it is evident that the phase diagram fig.[fig : tight ] is a natural extrapolation of the results shown in fig.[fig : kq ] , and it also follows the trend in fig.[fig : kq ] as one increases the interaction : the overall area of instability decreases while the dynamical instability spreads more in the area of landau instability .     and",
    "@xmath102 , are shown in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    ", width=245 ]      this dynamical instability was observed in a recent experiment@xcite , whose setup is schematically drawn in fig.[fig : exp ] .",
    "a cigar - shaped bec was formed in a magnetic trap superimposed with an optical lattice .",
    "this essentially prepared a bec in a bloch state at @xmath91 , the center of the brillouin zone .",
    "the magnetic trap was kept on to keep the quasi - one dimensional configuration , but its center was suddenly shifted by @xmath103 along the longitudinal direction .",
    "this is equivalent to displacing the whole bec off the center of the harmonic trap then releasing it .",
    "according to the semi - classical theory@xcite , [ eq : semi ] = de(k)k , = -^2 x , where @xmath104 is the system energy and @xmath105 is the longitudinal frequency of the magnetic trap .",
    "the bec begins to oscillate in both the real space and the momentum space ( brillouin zone ) . since @xmath106 near the center of the brillouin zone",
    ", both oscillations are harmonic when the displacement @xmath103 is small , as observed in the experiment . however ,",
    "when @xmath103 was over a certain critical value , say , @xmath107 , it was observed that the oscillations were disrupted and became dissipative .",
    "this dissipative behavior is caused mainly by the dynamical instability in our opinion although the authors of ref.@xcite attributed it to landau instability . when the displacement @xmath103 is small , the oscillation is confined near the center of the brillouin zone , where bloch states are stable as shown in fig.[fig : kq ] . with the increase of @xmath103",
    ", the bloch state will be driven into the dangerous zone of dynamical instability ; the oscillation then can be disrupted by the growth of modes of instability . in our units , this experiment has @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which is in the regime where the dynamical instability is rampant .",
    "further experiments in ref.@xcite found that @xmath107 increases with the decrease of the lattice strength @xmath9 , and there was no dissipation when the density of bec was low .",
    "these two observations basically rule out landau instability as the main cause of dissipation . as we see in each row of fig.[fig : kq ] , the landau instability , as represented by the light - shaded areas , is affected very little by the change of @xmath9 , thus @xmath107 should see no changes within experimental error when @xmath9 changes . also clear in fig.[fig : kq ] , when @xmath48 is small , almost all bloch states have landau instability . as a result ,",
    "more severe dissipation would have been observed for smaller @xmath48 if the landau instability was the main contributer .",
    "very recently , there was another experiment with a similar setup , but the optical lattice used is much stronger@xcite .",
    "the advantage of strong optical lattices is that dynamical instability is more severe , rendering landau instability less relevant . as a result ,",
    "the interpretation of the experimental observation is more definite and much less controversial than the one in ref.@xcite .",
    "there are other possible ways to observe the dynamical instability .",
    "one way is to prepare a bloch state then monitor how its periodicity changes over with bragg scattering of a probing laser beam by the bec cloud @xcite .",
    "another way is indirectly through the breakdown of bloch oscillations@xcite . within proper regime of parameters",
    ", the dynamical instability can be very severe and thus drive the system far away from a bloch state within a bloch period .",
    "this leads to the breakdown of bloch oscillations ; the observation of this breakdown is certainly an observation of dynamical instability .",
    "however , one must be careful since the nonlinear landau - zener tunneling due to the loop structure , as discussed in the last section , can also leads to the destruction of bloch oscillations .",
    "this ambiguity can be avoided by using dilute bec such that @xmath55 , where the loop does not exist .      as we emphasized above",
    ", dynamical instability happens only when both the optical lattice and the interaction between atoms exist .",
    "however , it does not imply that it is special to becs in optical lattices . to the contrary",
    ", it is very general .",
    "for example , it has been identified in a bec confined in a torus . in the following",
    ", we will demonstrate this point with a one - mode problem . to provide a slightly different angle ,",
    "we will present it in the language of operator algebra and use the bogoliubov approach@xcite .",
    "a discussion on a similar two - mode problem can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the one - mode problem is described by the hamiltonian written as [ eq : hgen ] h = a+b2+b2 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are two positive real numbers .",
    "the two operator @xmath112 and @xmath113 are generation and annihilation operators , respectively , satisfying the boson commutation relations = 1 ,   [ , ] = [ ^ , ^]=0 . this kind of quadratic hamiltonians are often found as the result of application of perturbation theory to a degenerate bose gas near a condensed state , such as eq.([eq : approx ] ) . for this simple one - mode case ,",
    "the @xmath114 matrix similar to eq.([eq : mmatrix ] ) is m=.    the bogoliubov approach is to diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hgen ] ) with the introduction of a new set of operators , = u+v^ *  ,   = u^*+vfor @xmath115 and @xmath116 to be boson operators , it requires that [ eq : boson ] |u|^2-|v|^2=1 . if @xmath117 and @xmath9 satisfy [ eq : sm ] _ z m= , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hgen ] ) becomes diagonal in @xmath115 and @xmath116 , up to a constant , [ eq : dh ] h=+^*2 .",
    "the phonon energy @xmath118 is easily found by solving eq.([eq : sm ] ) , and it is = . when @xmath119 , this energy becomes imaginary ; we , again , encounter dynamical instability .",
    "the simplicity of this one - mode problem allows us look more carefully into this instability .",
    "we notice from eq.([eq : dh ] ) that @xmath120 when @xmath118 becomes imaginary . at the same time",
    ", we find with eq.([eq : sm ] ) that @xmath121 , violating the condition ( [ eq : boson ] ) for @xmath115 and @xmath116 to be boson operators .",
    "in other words , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hgen ] ) defies the diagonalization by the bogoliubov approach when @xmath122 .",
    "the physics lies behind the failure of the bogoliubov diagonalization is the dynamical instability : the system is intrinsically unstable and , therefore , does not have any phonon excitation",
    ". we can look into this in a different representation .",
    "we write @xmath113 and @xmath112 in terms of space and momentum operators , = 1(+i )  ,  = 1(-i ) . as a result",
    ", the hamiltonian assumes the standard form of a harmonic oscillator , h = a+b2 ^ 2+a - b2 ^ 2 .",
    "it is evident here that , when @xmath122 , the system is a harmonic oscillator with a negative mass , an unstable system .",
    "a quantum system with dynamical instability , such as a harmonic oscillator with a negative mass , does not exist in nature .",
    "its appearance in the theoretical study only signals the onset of instability of the underlying unperturbed states . in our case , these unperturbed states are the bec bloch states .",
    "once these bloch states develop dynamical instability , it means that the gp equation , which predicts the existence of these bloch states , is no longer a good description of the system .",
    "the system enters a new unknown phase and demands a new mathematical description other than the mean - field theory , the gp equation . in ref.@xcite",
    ", the new phase was called `` insulator ''",
    ". there may be some experimental indications to call it `` insulator '' ; theoretically , we are yet to develop a theory accurately depicting the new phase . our theory , along with the one in ref.@xcite , can only predict when or where the dynamical instability sets in and the system enters a new phase ; it does not give any indication how the new phase should look like and behave .",
    "the dynamical instability is closely related to landau instability .",
    "as already briefly stated above , bloch waves with dynamical instability must also have landau instability ; on the other hand , bloch waves with landau instability are not necessarily dynamically unstable .",
    "this comes from a rigorous result on the relation between eigenvalues of @xmath62 and @xmath78 as proved in the appendix : when all the eigenvalues of @xmath62 are all positive , the eigenvalues @xmath77 of @xmath78 are all real .",
    "in summary , we have examined the superfluidity and many of its related properties of becs in optical lattices .",
    "we studied the tunneling between bloch bands and found that the tunneling is not zero even in the adiabatic limit when the repulsive interaction @xmath48 is strong enough .",
    "this dramatic tunneling behavior is due to the loop structure in the bloch band , a result of strong superfluidity .",
    "we investigated landau instability and dynamical instability of the system . with a phase diagram",
    ", we showed where landau and dynamical instability occur and how they change with the variation of the two system parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath9 .",
    "we have discussed the experimental observation of dynamical instability and its implication in this system .",
    "for simplicity , we will drop subscript @xmath23 and refer to these two matrices simply as @xmath123 and @xmath124 in this appendix .",
    "we are interested in the properties of their eigenvalues as defined in @xmath125 and @xmath126 the eigenvalues @xmath127 are all real since the matrix @xmath123 is hermitian . on the other hand ,",
    "the matrix @xmath124 is not hermitian and its eigenvalues @xmath128 are not necessarily all real .",
    "however , due to its special structure , the eigenvalues @xmath128 enjoy some very interesting properties .",
    "there is also a very important relation between the two sets eigenvalues , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "+ ( i ) _ if @xmath118 is one eigenvalue , then @xmath129 is also an eigenvalue of @xmath124 . in other words ,",
    "if the matrix @xmath124 has complex eigenvalues , they appear in conjugate pairs .",
    "_ + this becomes evident when we write the matrix in a form , where all its elements are real .",
    "note that , similar to the hamiltonian operator in the left hand side of eq.([eq : nlsi ] ) , @xmath124 is periodic in space so that one can express it in the space of fourier series .",
    "the expression is @xmath130 where @xmath131 @xmath132 and @xmath133 one can check by straightforward calculations that all the elements , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 are real .",
    "this particular expression is very convenient for numerical calculation : after neglecting fourier terms of orders higher than a cut - off order , say , @xmath35 , one reduces @xmath124 to a real @xmath137 matrix . to our experience",
    ", @xmath38 is sufficient .",
    "+ ( ii ) _ if @xmath118 is an eigenvalue of @xmath124 , then @xmath138 is an eigenvalue of @xmath139 .",
    "_   + write eq.(a.2 ) in another form , @xmath140    by some simple algebraic manipulations , one immediately observes that @xmath138 is an eigenvalue of @xmath139 with the corresponding eigenvector being @xmath141 .",
    "+ ( iii ) _",
    "when all the eigenvalues @xmath127 are positive , the eigenvalues @xmath128 must be all real._. + we multiply both sides of eq.(a.2 ) by @xmath142 then by @xmath143 , and obtain @xmath144 since the matrix @xmath123 is hermitian , the left hand side of the above equation is always real . as a result , if an eigenvalue @xmath128 is complex , then for its corresponding eigenvector @xmath145 , one has @xmath146 .",
    "when all eigenvalues of @xmath123 are positive , the left hand side of eq.(a.8 ) must be positive . in this particular case , one can conclude that the eigenvalues @xmath128 are all real and share the sign of @xmath147 .",
