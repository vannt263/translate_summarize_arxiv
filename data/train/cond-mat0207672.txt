    "recent experiments @xcite on electronic transport through carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) show series of interesting effects . changing the length of the nanotube one can change a character of the transport from the classical diffusive flow to the quantum transport .",
    "the way of coupling of the cnt to the electrodes is crucial for the transport properties .",
    "if the contact resistances are large ( @xmath0 13 k@xmath1 ) , the transport exhibits the incoherent single - electron tunnelling character with the coulomb blockade effect @xcite .",
    "improvement of the quality of the contacts results in an increase of the conductance of the system and one can observe the kondo resonance , which is due to exchange interactions of conducting electrons with an uncompensated spin localized on the cnt @xcite . in the case",
    "where the contacts are made very carefully and thus the coupling is strong , the transport through the system becomes coherent @xcite .",
    "the interference processes and multiple scattering on the contacts are very important in this limit and lead to the fabry - perot interference .",
    "we are interested in the coherent transport through molecular systems , particularly in magnetoresistance properties .",
    "our system is presented in figure 1 , where the single walled carbon nanotube ( swcnt ) is strongly coupled to ferromagnetic electrodes ( e.g. ni ) .",
    "coherent spin - dependent transport measurements were already performed on multiwalled cnt @xcite . despite the small value of the resistance ( @xmath29 k@xmath1 ) it is not possible to perceive interference processes and it is very difficult to specify the mechanism of magnetoresistance .",
    "the aim of our work is to investigate the influence of the interference on the spin - dependent transport through the swcnt in the regime of strong coupling .",
    "we consider the swcnts of the armchair type , which has 5 benzene rings in the circumference .",
    "it is well known that this type cnt has metallic electronic structure with two conducting channels .",
    "the first and the last row of carbon atoms are connected with the electrodes , which are treated as ideal reservoirs .",
    "= 3.5 cm    the system is described within the tight binding approach , in which the hopping integrals are assumed @xmath3 -2.5 ev for c ",
    "the hopping integral @xmath4 between the electrode and the carbon atom is treated as a parameter .",
    "the current is calculated from the time evolution of the electron number @xmath5 in the left electrode @xmath6.\\ ] ] here , @xmath7 is the lesser green function connecting the carbons form the first row of the nanotube with the left electrode .",
    "we sum over all incoming channels @xmath8 1, ... ,10 , wave vectors @xmath9 and spins @xmath10 1/2 .",
    "the non - equilibrium green functions are determined from the dyson equation and the bare green functions in the electrodes are taken as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are densities of states for electrons with the spin @xmath14 at the fermi energy in the left ( @xmath15 ) and right ( @xmath16 ) electrode , respectively .",
    "finally , we obtain the formula @xmath17\\sum_{i , j}|g^r_{li , rj}(\\omega)|^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the retarded green function connecting the channels in the electrodes and @xmath19 is the fermi distribution function for electrons in the @xmath20-electrode .",
    "fig . 2 presents the conductance @xmath21 calculated for the swcnt of the length of 90 atomic layers weakly and strongly connected to the gold electrode ( dashed and solid curve , respectively ) . for",
    "the weak coupling @xmath22 shows sharp resonant peaks at energies @xmath23 corresponding to standing electron waves in the cnt .",
    "there are two branches ( @xmath24 ) of the dispersion curves , and therefore @xmath25 is a superposition of the conductances for each channel @xmath26 . for a resonant transmission ( at @xmath23 )",
    "@xmath27 reaches its maximal value @xmath28 .",
    "if eigenvalues @xmath29 and @xmath30 are close to each other the value of the conductance is larger than @xmath31 ( see outer peaks on the left and the right hand side of the dashed curve in fig .",
    "next , we increase the coupling to the value @xmath32 1.3 ev , which gives @xmath22 close to the experimental data 3@xmath28  @xcite . for this case",
    "the resonant peaks are much broader . if the peaks are close to each other , they merge together leading to a single peak with the maximal value 4@xmath28 . however , the peaks can occur far from each other and then the effective conductance plot looks like at the center of the fig.2 ( close to @xmath33 ) . the similar effect was observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "our approach takes into account multiple scattering on the    contacts and interference processes .",
    "the electronic waves for both conducting channels corresponding to the dispersion curves @xmath34 are of different symmetry and a transfer matrix between them should be very small . in our opinion ,",
    "interference between the channels is irrelevant .",
    "it is in contrast to @xcite , where a main role was assigned to the fabry - perot interference .",
    "next , we study transport through swcnt attached to ferromagnetic electrodes .",
    "the density of states were determined by the band structure calculations performed using the tight binding version of the linear muffin - tin orbital method in the atomic sphere approximation @xcite .",
    "the results are presented in fig.3 for the system with the ni electrodes . the conducting channels for opposite spin orientations are different .",
    "therefore , @xmath22 is a superposition of four @xmath27 corresponding to the four different channels @xmath26 . since in ferromagnetic ni @xmath35 states",
    "/ ev for electrons with the up spin is much lower than @xmath36 1.7261 states / ev for minority electrons with the down spin , so in the parallel configuration ( @xmath37 ) the conductance @xmath38 shows broad peaks , which reach the value @xmath31 , while @xmath39 shows sharp peaks and their maximal value is @xmath40 .",
    "the composition of all channels results in @xmath41 with sharp peaks ( solid curve in fig .",
    "the situation is different for the antiparallel configuration ( @xmath42 ) @xmath43 ( see the dashed curve in fig .",
    "3a ) , where the peaks are relatively broad .",
    "the magnetoresistance @xmath44 is given by the relative difference of the conductance in the parallel and the antiparallel configuration . the results ( presented in fig .",
    "3b ) show large changes of the @xmath45 and that the maximal value can be very large ( max@xmath46 > 60\\%$ ] ) .",
    "an interesting case is the system with the cobalt electrodes .",
    "the density of states is @xmath47 0.1740 states / ev for the spin @xmath48 ( close to the value in ni ) , but @xmath36 0.7349 states / ev is much smaller .",
    "the peaks of the conductance @xmath39 are now much broader .",
    "the total conductance @xmath49 and @xmath43 for both orientations of polarization are shown in fig.4a .",
    "@xmath43 is higher and shows larger oscillations than for ni ( compare the dashed curves in fig.3a and 4a ) .",
    "the value of the magnetoresistance ( shown in fig.4b ) is smaller , but exhibits large oscillations .",
    "it is interesting that in this case @xmath45 can also be negative .",
    "our studies of coherent electronic transport through the swcnt showed that the conductance is a composition of contributions from four channels .",
    "although multiple scattering and interference processes were included in this approach , we could not observe any feature of destructive interference . in our opinion",
    ", the conducting channels correspond to waves of different symmetry and matrix elements between them are small .",
    "we also considered the spin - dependent transport in the system with the ferromagnetic ni and co electrodes . due to a resonant nature of the electronic transport",
    "the magnetoresistance shows large oscillations and achieves large values ( max @xmath46\\approx$ ] 60@xmath50 and 30@xmath50 for ni and co , respectively ) . since the density of states for minority electrons ( with @xmath51 )",
    "are different in ni and co , the magnetoresistance is different in both cases . for the co electrodes @xmath45 can even change the sign and can be either positive or negative depending on the gate voltage applied to the carbon nanotube .",
    "we believe that in near future one can produce systems with coherent contacts between ferromagnetic electrodes and the swcnt , and that our theoretical predictions will be verified .",
