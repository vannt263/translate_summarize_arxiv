    "the supernova / acceleration probe ( snap ) is a proposed space - based telescope dedicated to the study of dark energy through the observations of type ia supernovae ( ia sne ) and a deep , wide area weak lensing survey@xcite . from its orbit at the second earth - sun lagrange point ( l2 )",
    ", snap will carry out two surveys : a deep survey of @xmath4 square degree field with 4-day cadence repeat visits over a period of 22 months to discover and obtain light curves and spectra of over 2000 ia sne in the redshift range @xmath5 ; and a wide area weak lensing map to study the growth of large scale structure that will cover 1000 square degrees per year to a depth of ab magnitude @xmath6 in the optical filters . in an extended 6 year snap mission ,",
    "the weak lensing survey covers 4000 square degrees and the mission lifetime .",
    "the telescope is designed with a @xmath7 square degree instrumented field of view divided evenly between 36 ccds and 36 hgcdte detectors . the snap observing strategy implements a four - point dither pattern with an exposure time of 300 seconds to recover spatial information from the undersampled optics and to reject cosmic rays .",
    "the focal plane will be passively cooled to 140  k. nine fixed filters cover the wavelength range 400  nm to 1700  nm . with a diffraction",
    "limited point spread function ( psf ) of @xmath8 arcseconds at  800 nm and zodiacal - dominated background , snap will have significantly improved resolution and decreased contamination from sky background compared to ground based telescopes .",
    "the snap focal plane design uses thick , fully depleted ccds developed at lbnl  @xcite for visible to near ir observations in six bandpass filters . in space , these detectors will be exposed to significant radiation , primarily solar protons . in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects of six years of radiation at l2 on snap ccds in order to qualify them for use in a space mission . in ",
    "[ section : ccd ] we describe the snap ccds and the specifications for performance .",
    "the space environment and expected radiation exposure are discussed in  [ section : space ] .",
    "irradiation using the 88-inch cyclotron and the @xmath0co source at lbnl is described in  [ section : irrad ] and  [ section : co60 ] respectively .",
    "ccd performance after proton irradiation is reported in  [ section : results ] and after @xmath0co irradiation in  [ section : co60 results ] .",
    "finally , we present an interpretation of the results in the context of the snap mission in  [ section : discussion ] and the conclusions in  [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "wavelength coverage & @xmath9 nm & @xmath9 nm + quantum & @xmath10 at @xmath11 nm & @xmath10 at @xmath11 nm + efficiency & @xmath12 at 1000 nm & @xmath12 at 1000 nm + readout time & 30 seconds & 30 seconds + read noise & 6 e@xmath1 & 4 e@xmath1 + diffusion ( rms ) & @xmath13",

    "a factor of ten increase in thickness over conventional ccds provides vastly improved sensitivity toward wavelengths of @xmath19 m and negligible fringing effects caused by multiple reflections in the silicon@xcite .",
    "the ccds are depleted through application of a substrate bias voltage across the full thickness .",
    "the spatial resolution can be improved by increasing the bias voltage up to 200  v@xcite , with a nominal operating voltage of 100  v for the snap mission .",
    "the snap focal plane will be populated with 36 lbnl ccds , each having @xmath20 @xmath21 m pixels .",
    "the objectives of the snap experiment are to extract point - source sne from diffuse host galaxies and to resolve distant galaxies for weak lensing studies .",
    "the specifications for ccd performance are therefore governed by requirements for preservation of the point spread function ( psf ) , high quantum efficiency ( qe ) , charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) and signal - to - noise ratio . in table",
    "[ table : specs ] we list the specifications for the snap ccds .",
    "as can been seen in the table , each of these requirements has been met in the current design of snap style devices before radiation exposure .",
    "ccd performance is expected to degrade in a radiation environment due to bulk damage from non - ionizing energy loss ( niel ) and due to charging of oxide layers from ionizing radiation .",
    "the major bulk damage in conventional n - channel ccds is caused by traps generated in the formation of phosphorus - vacancy centers@xcite .",
    "this bulk damage manifests itself through decreased charge transfer efficiency , increased dark current , and isolated hot pixels .",
    "the lbnl p - channel ccds are fabricated on high - resistivity n - type silicon with boron implanted channels . in the p - channel ccds",
    ", divacancy states are expected to be the dominant hole trap @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted that divacancy formation in p - channel ccds is less favorable than phosphorus - vacancy traps in n - channel ccds @xcite , and prior studies have shown improved performance after radiation exposure @xcite .",
    "ionizing radiation is expected to result in charging of oxide layers , requiring adjustment of pixel gate voltages and output source follower transistor biasing .",
    "significant increases in dark current after ionizing radiation have also been observed in p - channel ccds@xcite . in this work",
    "we investigate the effects of both kinds of radiation damage on snap ccds , focusing on generation of dark current , hot pixels , and decrease in charge transfer efficiency .",
    "the snap satellite will orbit at the l2 lagrange point , approximately @xmath22  km from earth . at this distance , solar protons dominate the total radiation dose . to estimate the total exposure at l2",
    ", we use the emission of solar protons ( esp ) model described in @xcite and the space environment information system ( spenvis)@xcite . in spenvis , the solar model is simplified as a cycle with seven years at maximum activity with constant exposure and four years at minimum activity with no exposure .",
    "the model provides a statistical estimate of the fluence as a function of confidence interval based on data from the past three solar cycles .",
    "a simple shielding model is used in which a spherical aluminum shell surrounds the detectors .",
    "the propagation of particles through the shielding is also simplified ; showers and secondary particles are not modeled . with these simplifications ,",
    "we make a first - order estimate of the effects of radiation on the snap visible detectors .",
    "a more detailed monte carlo simulation of the propagation of particles through the structures of the satellite will be performed at a later date .",
    "upper limits assuming a six year mission with launch date january 1 , 2014 .",
    "a shielding thickness of @xmath23  mm is the average amount of shielding of the snap focal plane.,width=331 ]    assuming a six year extended mission with a january 1 , 2014 launch date , we estimate the accumulated radiation exposure for the snap ccds at the @xmath24 confidence level .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] shows the spectrum of protons incident on the detectors for various shield thicknesses predicted by esp and spenvis .",
    "similarly , figure  [ fig : niel ] reports the integrated non - ionizing energy loss ( niel ) as a function of shield thickness .",
    "upper limits assuming a six year mission with launch date january 1 , 2014 . for comparison ,",
    "the average amount of shielding surrounding the snap focal plane is equivalent to 47 mm of aluminum.,width=331 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     monte carlo simulations of radiation exposure by propagation of solar protons through the complex shielding of the snap satellite will finalize estimates of radiation dose over the mission lifetime .",
    "additional analysis is required to quantify the impact of the degraded performance on science observations : cte degradation impact on galaxy shapes for weak lensing science goals and cte dependence on sources signal strength .",
    "future studies of the effects of @xmath0co irradiation over a longer time span would be useful in better understanding the mechanism for the generation of dark current .",
    "nevertheless , the results reported here show that the lbnl ccds are significantly more radiation tolerant than n - channel ccds currently in use in space - based observatories .",
    "this makes the lbnl ccds an excellent choice for use in future space - based missions such as snap .",
