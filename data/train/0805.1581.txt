    "unfortunately , prior to the analysis undertaken in paper i , not all of the above criteria were fully formulated , and so we have also targetted sources for which only the last criterion is satisfied . in this paper",
    "we present the results of a survey for redshifted atomic and molecular absorption within the hosts of sources selected from the parkes quarter - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( pqfs , @xcite ) .    due to the search for coincident molecular absorption , we initially prioritised sources in which the hco@xmath40 @xmath41 transition would be redshifted into the 12-mm band of the tidbinbilla 70-m telescope .",

    "our target sample therefore consisted ( primarily ) of objects in the pqfs where either the  21-cm or oh 18-cm ( @xmath46 ) transition was redshifted into the 90-cm ( @xmath47 mhz ) band . due to time constraints during the observations , we prioritised the targets in which @xmath48 , in order to preferentially select sources where the presence of dust , associated with dense gas , would dim the visible and ultra - violet light .",
    "this left 13 out of the original 19 targets ( see table  [ sum ] ) .",
    "we used all 30 antennae and the 90-cm receiver over a 2 mhz bandwidth ( giving a coverage of @xmath49 ) . over the 128 channels ( 2 polarisations )",
