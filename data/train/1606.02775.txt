    "the topic of vector bundles in algebraic geometry is a broad field with a rich history . in the 70 s and 80 s , one of the main questions of interest was the study of low rank vector bundles on projective spaces @xmath0 .",
    "one particularly challenging conjecture in this subject is the following .    if @xmath1 then any rank @xmath2 bundle on @xmath3 splits as a direct sum of line bundles .",
    "the hartshorne conjecture is connected to the study of subvarieties of projective space of small codimension . in particular",
    ", the above statement implies that if @xmath4 is a codimension @xmath2 smooth subvariety and @xmath5 is a multiple of the hyperplane class then @xmath6 is a complete intersection .",
    "thus , early intersect in the study of vector bundles was born out of classical questions in projective geometry .",
    "study of these types of questions led naturally to the study of _ moduli spaces _ of ( semistable ) vector bundles , parameterizing the isomorphism classes of ( semistable ) vector bundles with given numerical invariants on a projective variety @xmath6 ( we will define _ semistable _ later  for now , view it as a necessary condition to get a good moduli space ) . as often happens in mathematics ,",
    "these spaces have become interesting in their own right , and their study has become an entire industry .",
    "beginning in the 80 s and 90 s , and continuing to today , people have studied the basic questions of the geometry of these spaces .",
    "are they smooth ?",
    "what do their singularities look like ?",
    "when is the moduli space nonempty ?",
    "what are divisors on the moduli space ?",
    "especially when @xmath6 is a curve or surface , satisfactory answers to these questions can often be given .",
    "we will survey several foundational results of this type in  [ sec - moduli]-[sec - properties ] .",
    "more recently , there has been a great deal of interest in the study of the _ birational geometry _ of moduli spaces of various geometric objects .",
    "loosely speaking , the goal of such a program is to understand alternate birational models , or _ compactifications _ , of a moduli space as themselves being moduli spaces for slightly different geometric objects .",
    "for instance , the hassett - keel program @xcite studies alternate compactifications of the deligne - mumford compactification @xmath7 of the moduli space of stable curves .",
    "different compactifications can be obtained by studying ( potentially unstable ) curves with different types of singularities .",
    "in addition to being interesting in their own right , moduli spaces provide explicit examples of higher dimensional varieties which can frequently be understood in great detail .",
    "we survey the birational geometry of moduli spaces of sheaves from a classical viewpoint in  [ sec - classical ] .    in the last several years",
    ", there has been a great deal of progress in the study of the birational geometry of moduli spaces of sheaves owing to bridgeland s introduction of the concept of a _ stability condition _ @xcite .",
    "very roughly , there is a complex manifold @xmath8 , the _ stability manifold _ , parameterizing stability conditions @xmath9 on @xmath6 .",
    "there is a moduli space corresponding to each condition @xmath9 , and the stability manifold decomposes into chambers where the corresponding moduli space does not change as @xmath9 varies in the chamber . for one of these chambers , the _ gieseker chamber _ , the corresponding moduli space is the ordinary moduli space of semistable sheaves .",
    "the moduli spaces corresponding to other chambers often happen to be the alternate birational models of the ordinary moduli space . in this way , the birational geometry of a moduli space of sheaves can be viewed in terms of a variation of the moduli problem . in  [ sec - bridgeland ]",
    "we will introduce bridgeland stability conditions , and especially study stability conditions on a surface .",
    "we study some basic examples on @xmath10 in  [ sec - exp2 ] . finally , we close the paper in  [ sec - positivity ] by surveying some recent results on the computation of ample cones of hilbert schemes of points and moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces .",
    "i would especially like to thank izzet coskun and benjamin schmidt for many discussions on bridgeland stability and related topics . in addition , i would like to thank the referee of this article for many valuable comments , as well as barbara bolognese , yinbang lin , eric riedl , matthew woolf , and xialoei zhao .",
    "finally , i would like to thank the organizers of the 2015 bootcamp in algebraic geometry and the 2015 ams summer research institute on algebraic geometry , as well as the funding organizations for these wonderful events .",
    "the definition of a bridgeland stability condition is motivated by the classical theory of semistable sheaves . in this section",
    "we review the basics of the theory of moduli spaces of sheaves , particularly focusing on the case of a surface .",

    ".    the basic question is whether or not @xmath28 can be represented by some nice object , e.g. by a projective variety or a scheme .",
    "we recall the following definitions .",

    "a functor @xmath32 is _ corepresented _ by a scheme @xmath6 if there is a natural transformation @xmath33 with the following universal property : if @xmath34 is a scheme and @xmath35 a natural transformation , then there is a unique morphism @xmath36 such that @xmath37 is the composition of @xmath38 with the transformation @xmath39 induced by @xmath40 .",
    "note that if @xmath41 is represented by @xmath6 then it is also corepresented by @xmath6 .    if @xmath41 is represented by @xmath6 , then @xmath42 .",

    "this need not be true if @xmath41 is only corepresented by @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath41 is corepresented by @xmath6 , then @xmath6 is unique up to a unique isomorphism .",
    "we now come to the basic definition of moduli space of sheaves .",

    "the compatibilities in the definition of a natural transformation ensure that in the case of a family @xmath15 parameterized by a base @xmath14 the image in @xmath46 of a point @xmath17 depends only on the isomorphism class of the sheaf @xmath18 parameterized by @xmath50 .    in the ideal case where the moduli functor @xmath28 has a fine moduli space",

    "this universal sheaf has the property that if @xmath15 is a family of semistable sheaves on @xmath6 parameterized by @xmath14 and @xmath54 is the moduli map , then @xmath15 and @xmath55 are equivalent .      in this subsection",
    "we give some examples to illustrate the importance of the as - yet - undefined _ semistability _ hypothesis in the definition of the moduli functor .",

    "any such curve @xmath59 which asymptotically minimizes formula ( [ centerw ] ) in this way computes the gieseker wall for @xmath909 .",
    "curves orthogonal to the divisor @xmath901 given by a stability condition on the gieseker wall can now be obtained by varying the extension class in the sequence @xmath928 this corresponds to letting @xmath432 move in a pencil on @xmath59 , which can certainly be done for @xmath909 .",
    "more care is taken in @xcite to determine the precise bounds on @xmath86 which are necessary for the various steps of the proof .",
    "the general method is applied to compute nef cones of hilbert schemes of sufficiently many points on very general surfaces in @xmath929 , very general double covers of @xmath10 , and del pezzo surfaces of degree @xmath80 .",
    "the last example provides an example of a surface of higher picard rank , where the variation of the twisting divisor is exploited .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "we highlight one of the first interesting cases where the answer appears to be unknown .",
    "we close our discussion with a survey of the main result of @xcite on the cone of nef divisors on a moduli space of sheaves with large discriminant on an arbitrary smooth surface . in the case of @xmath10 , this result",
    "was first discovered in the papers @xcite .",
    "the picture for an arbitrary surface is a modest simultaneous generalization of the @xmath10 case as well as the hilbert scheme case for an arbitrary surface ( see  7.4 or @xcite ) .",
    "again let @xmath6 be a smooth surface and let @xmath673 be divisors giving a slice of stability conditions .",
    "let @xmath165 be the character of an @xmath667-semistable sheaf of positive rank .",
    "we assume the discriminant @xmath934 is sufficiently large .",
    "suppose the moduli space @xmath674 carries a ( quasi-)universal family .",
    "the goal of @xcite is to compute the gieseker wall for @xmath165 in the @xmath667-slice and to show that the divisor @xmath901 corresponding to a stability condition @xmath9 on the gieseker wall is a boundary nef divisor .",
    "the basic picture is similar to the case of a hilbert scheme of points , and indeed theorem [ thm - hilbasymptotic ] will follow as a special case of this more general result .",
    "however , the asymptotics can easily be made much more explicit in the hilbert scheme case .",
    "the common thread between the two results is that as the discriminant @xmath935 is increased , the character @xmath579 of a destabilizing subobject giving rise to the gieseker wall stabilizes .",
    "it is furthermore easy to give properties which almost uniquely define the character @xmath579 .      1 .   [ cond - rankbound]we have @xmath936 , and if @xmath937 , then @xmath938 is effective .",
    "[ cond - slopeclose ] we have @xmath939 , and @xmath940 is as close to @xmath941 as possible subject to [ cond - rankbound ] .",
    "[ cond - stable ] the moduli space @xmath942 is nonempty .",
    "[ cond - discriminantminimal ] the discriminant @xmath943 is as small as possible , subject to [ cond - rankbound]-[cond - stable ] .",
    "[ cond - rankmaximal ] the rank @xmath944 is as large as possible , subject to [ cond - rankbound]-[cond - discriminantminimal ] .",
    "note that properties [ cond - rankbound]-[cond - discriminantminimal ] uniquely determine the slope @xmath940 and discriminant @xmath943 , although @xmath945 is not necessarily uniquely determined",
    ". condition [ cond - rankmaximal ] uniquely specifies the rank of @xmath579 .",
    "we then have the following theorem . furthermore ,",
    "notice that the definition does not depend on the discriminant @xmath935 , so that @xmath579 can be held constant as @xmath915 varies .",
    "[ thm - moduliasymptotic ] suppose @xmath946 .",
    "then the gieseker wall for @xmath165 in the @xmath667-slice is computed by a destabilizing subobject of character @xmath579 , where @xmath579 is an extremal chern character for @xmath165 .",
    "furthermore , the divisor @xmath901 corresponding to a stability condition @xmath9 on the gieseker wall is a boundary nef divisor .",
    "the argument is largely similar to the proof of theorem [ thm - hilbasymptotic ] .",
    "first one shows that the destabilizing subobject along the gieseker wall must actually be a subsheaf , and not some higher rank object .",
    "this justifies restriction [ cond - rankbound ] in the definition of @xmath579 ( note that if @xmath947 then the only way there can be an injection of sheaves @xmath175 with @xmath580 and @xmath738 is if the induced map @xmath948 is injective , forcing @xmath949 to be effective .",
    "next , one shows that the subsheaf defining the gieseker wall must actually be an @xmath667-semistable sheaf .",
    "recalling the formula @xmath950 for the center of a wall , conditions [ cond - slopeclose]-[cond - discriminantminimal ] then ensure that the numerical wall defined by @xmath579 is as large as possible when @xmath951 .",
    "therefore , the gieseker wall for @xmath165 is no larger than the wall defined by the extremal character @xmath579 .    actually computing the extremal character @xmath579",
    "can be extremely challenging . minimizing the discriminant of @xmath579 subject to",
    "the condition that the moduli space @xmath942 is nonempty essentially requires knowing the sharpest possible bogomolov inequalities for semistable sheaves on @xmath6 .",
    "conversely , if the nef cones of moduli spaces of sheaves on @xmath6 are known , strong bogomolov - type inequalities can be deduced . on surfaces such as @xmath10 and @xmath572 surfaces ,",
    "the extremal character can be computed mechanically using the classification of semistable sheaves ; recall for example  [ sssec - existp2 ] and  [ sssec - k3exist ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm - moduliasymptotic ] diverges from the hilbert scheme case when we need to show that the numerical wall for @xmath165 defined by an extremal character @xmath579 is an actual wall . in the hilbert scheme case ,",
    "it is trivial to produce ideal sheaves @xmath348 which are destabilized by a rank @xmath80 object @xmath910 : we simply put @xmath432 on @xmath59 , and get an exact sequence @xmath952 which is an exact sequence in the categories along the wall if the number of points is sufficiently large .    to prove theorem [ thm - moduliasymptotic ]",
    ", we instead need to produce @xmath667-semistable sheaves @xmath12 of character @xmath165 fitting in sequences of the form @xmath608 where @xmath77 is @xmath667-semistable of character @xmath579 .",
    "this is somewhat technical .",
    "let @xmath953 ; then @xmath954 has @xmath955 , and @xmath956 . therefore , by induction on the rank , we may assume the gieseker wall of @xmath954 has been computed .",
    "we then show that the gieseker walls for @xmath579 and @xmath954 are nested inside @xmath757 if @xmath957 .",
    "therefore , any sheaves @xmath958 and @xmath959 are actually @xmath9-semistable for any stability condition @xmath9 on @xmath463 .",
    "then any extension @xmath12 of @xmath458 by @xmath77 is @xmath9-semistable , and it can further be shown that a general such extension is actually @xmath667-stable . by varying the extension class , we can produce curves in @xmath674 parameterizing non - isomorphic @xmath667-stable sheaves ; these curves are orthogonal to the nef divisor given by the gieseker wall .",
