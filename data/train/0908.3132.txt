    "fidelity , a concept emerging from quantum information theory , has recently become an attractive approach towards the study of critical phenomena in condensed matter physics . in a quantum many - body system ,",
    "the quantum phase transition is completely driven by the quantum fluctuation in the ground state and is incarnated by an abrupt change in the qualitative structure of the ground state wavefunction as the system varies across the critical point @xcite . therefore",
    ", being a measure of the similarity between two states , the fidelity is excepted to show a dramatic change across the transition points .",
    "this motivated people to start exploring its role played in quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "moreover , as the fidelity can be viewed as a space geometrical quantity , no a priori knowledge of the order parameter and symmetry breaking of the system is required .",
    "this is thus a great advantage to the study of quantum phase transitions using fidelity approaches .    following the streamline of fidelity , some alternative schemes , like the fidelity susceptibility @xcite , fidelity per site @xcite , operator fidelity @xcite , and density - functional fidelity @xcite , have been proposed .",
    "as to establish a closer picture to condensed matter physics , we follow the concept of fidelity susceptibility in this paper .",
    "mathematically , the fidelity susceptibility is just the leading term of the fidelity .",
    "it defines the response of the fidelity to the driving parameter . as a result",
    ", the singularity of the fidelity across the transition points could thus be reflected in the divergence of the fidelity susceptibility .",
    "in fact , this argument has been consolidated by the results in a number of one - dimensional quantum many - body systems @xcite ( see also a review article @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the behavior of the fidelity susceptibility in two two - dimensional ( 2d ) models , namely the 2d transverse field ising model and the xxz model numerically .",
    "our results show that the fidelity susceptibility as a function of the driving parameter diverges at the quantum phase transition points in both of the models .",
    "the scaling behavior of the extremum of the fidelity susceptibility at the transition point and that of the second derivative of the ground state energy are also compared . from those results , the theoretical argument that the fidelity susceptibility is a more sensitive indicator than the second derivative of the ground state energy in searching for a second order quantum phase transition is testified . besides , it is also found that the fidelity susceptibility shows a scaling behavior in the vicinity of the critical point and its critical exponents for both models are also obtained through finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "for a general form of the hamiltonian , @xmath0where @xmath1 is the driving hamiltonian and @xmath2 denotes its strength .",
    "the fidelity is the modulus of the overlap between two ground states @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5since our focus is on continuous quantum phase transitions , the ground state of the hamiltonian is non - degenerated for a finite system .",
    "@xmath6 can thus be obtained from the time - independent non - degenerated perturbation theory . extracting the leading term of the fidelity ,",
    "the fidelity susceptibility can be expressed as @xcite @xmath7^{2 } } ,   \\label{eq : fspert}\\]]where @xmath8 is a set of orthogonal basis satisfying @xmath9 . on the other hand , consider the second derivative of the ground state energy with respect to @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath10one may easily realize that the above expression is very similar to the perturbation form of fidelity susceptibility in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fspert ] ) except having different exponent in the denominator .",
    "therefore , one may expect that both the singularity of fidelity susceptibility and the second derivative of the ground state energy are intrinsically due to the vanishing of the energy gap in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "however , the difference in the exponent of the dominator makes fidelity susceptibility a more sensitive quantity in searching for quantum phase transitions . that is to say ,",
    "while the fidelity susceptibility shows a divergence at the critical point , the second derivative of the ground state energy may still be a continuous function .     which can be placed on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions.,width=302 ]    furthermore , to study the scaling behavior of the fidelity susceptibility around the critical point , we may perform finite - size scaling analysis lcvenuti07,guscal .",
    "let s consider a system consisting of @xmath11 sites such that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the real dimension of the system . around the critical point @xmath14",
    ", the fidelity susceptibility behaves as @xmath15 where @xmath16(@xmath17 ) is the critical exponent of the fidelity susceptibility above ( below ) the critical point , @xmath18 is the quantum adiabatic dimension and hence @xmath19 is an intensive quantity . for a finite system ,",
    "if the fidelity susceptibility shows a peak at a certain point @xmath20 , it s maximum value scales like @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the critical adiabatic dimension .",
    "the above two asymptotic behaviors satisfy @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant , b is a non - zero function of @xmath25 and both of them are independent of the system size . from eq .",

    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "this model was originally introduced by de gennes to describe potassium - dihydrogen - phosphate type ferroelectrics @xcite and has been studied extensively via various approaches , like real - space renormalization group @xcite , density - matrix renormalization @xcite , numerical diagonalization@xcite , and entanglement @xcite .",

    "for the 2d xxz model , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath69where @xmath70 is the dimensionless parameter characterizing the anisotropy of the model .",

    "must be performed @xcite .",
    "therefore , a physical quantity which is more sensitive to the system size than the traditional second derivative of the ground state energy would be very useful to study the critical phenomena numerically .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_xxz ] ) , it can be easily seen that the hamiltonian of the xxz model commutes with the @xmath48-component of total spin operator @xmath71 .",

    "it is well known that long - range orders are present in both of the two phases . however , whether there s a long - range order at the critical point is still an open question . with the help of fidelity susceptibility ,",
    "we may also find some hints towards this question .",
    "the numerical result of the averaged fidelity susceptibility for various system sizes of the 2d xxz model on a square lattice as a function of @xmath80 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xxz_fs ] .",
    "the averaged fidelity susceptibility is an intensive quantity , meaning that @xmath81 , on both sides of the critical point .",
    "moreover , like the previous case of the ising model , the averaged fidelity susceptibility of the xxz model also shows a peak at @xmath82 .",

    "nevertheless , following the idea of the implication of existence of long - range correlation from the divergence of the fidelity susceptibility @xcite , we argue that long - range correlation is in fact present at the transition point of the 2d xxz model .",
    "this is also in agreement with the previous conclusion drawn from the study of the 2d xxz model using entanglement guxxzentan .    in comparison ,",
