    "in this contribution we produce approximations for some hamiltonians such as the ones related with the morse potential and cosine potential ( quantum rotor , or mathiue differential equation ) .",
    "the approximation is based on the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite and symmetric ordering of ladder operators @xcite .",
    "the rwa is widely used in quantum optical systems and particularly in jaynes - cummings types of models @xcite and its extensions @xcite , for example in ion traps @xcite , cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite and population transfer in atoms and molecules @xcite .",
    "also the breakdown of the approximations in similar systems has been considered in several papers @xcite .",
    "the rwa is usually used for two ( or more ) interacting subsystems , and in all the above examples , interaction between different subsystems are considered .",
    "when passing to the interaction picture with respect to the free hamiltonian , one remains with a time dependent hamiltonian that under certain conditions on the frequencies involved may take a simpler form by neglecting terms that oscillate rapidly @xcite .",
    "a phenomelogical motivation for the approximation is that the neglected terms usually describe non - energy conserving processes , which in the jaynes - cummings model discribe simultaneous excitation of the atom / ion and the quantized field .",
    "the neglected terms , usually very small within the axperimental parameter regimes , give rise to the bloch - siegert shift of the energies @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that we can also apply a rwa in a single hamiltonian systems . developing the potential in a taylor series and grouping the quadratic term of the hamiltonian with the kinetic energy to produce a harmonic oscillator term plus an infinite sum .",
    "the frequency of the _ artificially produced _ harmonic oscillator ( ho ) is then used as a reference to apply the rwa to the remaining sum .",
    "we call this ho a self - ho for the hamiltonian studied . using the underlying algebra of the oscillator ladder operators and the rwa ,",
    "closed forms of the infintie sums are given in two special cases .",
    "only hamiltonain systems containing bound or quasi bound states may be approximated , and the validity depends on the relative `` deepth / width '' of the potential ; the deeper and narrower potential the better approximation .",
    "thus , it is best suited for low excited bound states , which is verified by numerical simulations .",
    "it is also shown that the rwa gives the result of regular first order perturbation theory of the self - ho , which again underlines the validity regimes of the approximation .",
    "we proceed as follows , in the next section we introduce the self - ho and its fock states of an arbritary hamiltonian and derive expressions for the diagonal elements of this hamiltonian in the fock basis .",
    "this is achieved using the properties of the ladder operators . in sections",
    "[ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] , the connection with the rwa is given and two specific models are considered ; the mathieu and morse equations respectively .",
    "the validity of the approximation is investigated in section [ numsec ] for both studied cases .",
    "secton [ sec5 ] is left for a summery , and in the appendix [ app ] is is shown how the methods may be used in a more genaral way for calculating various sums .",
    "given an arbitrary hamiltonian we expand the potential term in a taylor series ( in the following we consider for simplicity the case of unit mass and @xmath0 ) @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "we let this frequency @xmath3 define the ladder operators @xcite for the hamiltonian systems as @xmath4 the eigenstates of the number operator @xmath5 is the fock states , labeled @xmath6 .",
    "the ladder operators incrase or decrease the quantum number @xmath7 when acted on a fock state ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "thus , only terms of the infinite sum @xmath10 of equation ( [ arbitrary ] ) that contain an equal number of @xmath11:s and @xmath12:s will contribute to the diagonal matrix elements @xmath13 .",
    "when considering those elemenst we may therefor neglect all other terms of the sum .",
    "we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the weyl ( symmetric ) ordering of the operator @xmath16 .",
    "it may be transformed into normal ordering using @xcite @xmath17 thus , the new sum @xmath18 , when the `` off - diagonal '' terms have been neglected ( this sum will now depend on the operator @xmath19 ) , may be written as @xmath20 the second sum may be taken to infinity ( as we may only add zeros ) @xmath21 for @xmath22 the above expression is zero and thus we make the substitution @xmath23 and get @xmath24 by using the identity @xmath25 the sum is diagonalized in the number basis @xmath26 and we get the diagonal elements of ( [ arbitrary ] ) @xmath27 where we have used that @xmath28 .",
    "note that the fock basis used to calculate the diagonal elements of the hamiltonian are obtained from the quadratic term of the hamiltonian and we call them @xmath6 instead of the usual notation @xmath29 . in the following sections we apply the above to some specific examples .",
    "using the fact that we can obtain closed forms for the diagonal elements of some of the potentials studied in section [ sec2 ] , and noting that the rwa is used to keep constant terms ( terms that do not rotate ) , in this section we show that for some hamiltonians we can produce approximations under certain circumstances , namely , when some parameters allow us to perform the rwa .",
    "one very important equation for scientists is the mathieu equation @xcite which is identical to the schrdinger equation with a sin or cosin potential , also known as the quantum rotor .",
    "durning the last decade it has gained a new shove of attention due to the growing field of cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "approximate results of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the mathieu equation have been studied earlier @xcite .",
    "known approximation methods from physics , such as the wkb and the raman - nath have been applied to the mathieu equation @xcite .",
    "given the hamiltonian ( reminding that we set @xmath0 and @xmath30 )    @xmath31    we can expand the cosine as ( we neglect the constat term as it only displaces the energies ) @xmath32 with the above definition of the creation and annihilation operators ( [ lad ] ) , we get @xmath33 and rewrite the hamiltonian as @xmath34 in the case @xmath35 we can do rwa , and thus go to a rotating frame with respect to the free hamiltonian , @xmath36 . using the relations @xmath37 and by only keeping non - rotating tyerms in the hamiltonian we find @xmath38    we now proced as in section [ sec2 ] . inserting ( [ rwa2 ] ) into ( [ hami1 ] )",
    "we have @xmath39 with @xmath40 rearranging terms and like in equation ( [ sum1 ] ) we can sum @xmath41 to infinity to get @xmath42 by expressing @xmath43 we can write @xmath44 with @xmath45 and    @xmath46    note that , like previous in section [ sec2 ] , the second sum in equation ( [ sum2 ] ) may be started at @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48 or @xmath49 or using that @xmath50 @xmath51 the result obtained here agree with previous results were approximations to the mathieu equation are obtained @xcite .",
    "the result also gives an interesting relation between zeroth bessel function and laguerre polynomials .",
    "combining the results we find the diagonalized rwa hamiltonian @xmath52 if we develop the laguerre polynomials in powers of @xmath53 , which should be valid within the regimes of the rwa , and remain to second order we obtain @xmath54 it should also be pointed out that the method also works for superimposed cosine potentials ; @xmath55 .",
    "this has interesting applications in for example solid state physics @xcite and cold atoms in optical superlattices @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section by making an analogy betwen the rwa and first order perturbation theory . given the hamiltonian @xmath56 with eigenstates @xmath6",
    ", we perturb it with @xmath57 the first order corerection to the energy @xcite becomes @xmath58 which regains exactly the same result as the one obtained from the rwa method .",
    "this relation between first order perturbation theory and the rwa method is easily shown , using eq .",
    "( [ diagrel ] ) , to be valid in any general case .",
    "now let us look at the morse potential @xcite , from which we get the hamiltonian @xmath59)^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this kind of hamiltonian is commonly used to describe properties of diatomic molecules and other situation with anharmonicity @xcite .",
    "the morse hamiltonian has turned out to have interesting properties in connection with the wkb approximation @xcite ( the wkb quantization gives the exact spectrum ) , and with supersymetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "one can transform the hamiltonian by means of the displacement operator @xmath60 so that @xmath61)^2 $ ] .",
    "the transformed hamiltonian is then written in the approximate form ( we neglect odd powers because of rwa , i.e. we are in the regime @xmath62 )    @xmath63    with @xmath64 following the procedure of the former section we may write @xmath65 and @xmath66 giving the rwa hamiltonian @xmath67 using the fact that @xmath68 in the rwa validity regime , we expand the hamiltonian to second order in @xmath69 @xmath70    note that if we write the ( transformed ) morse hamiltonian as @xmath71)^2 - \\frac{2\\lambda^2\\alpha^2}{2 } \\frac{(\\hat{a}+\\hat{a}^{\\dagger})^2}{{2\\sqrt{2}\\lambda\\alpha } } \\label{otro - morse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and express the exponentials in a factorized normal form @xmath72 = e^{\\alpha^2/2 } \\sum_{n=0 } \\sum_{k=0 } \\frac{\\alpha^{n+k } \\hat{a}^{\\dagger n}\\hat{a}^k } { n!k!},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] rwa on the above expression keeps only terms @xmath73 , i.e. the double sum becomes a single sum , leading to laguerre polynomials of order ( operator ) @xmath7 . in this form",
    "we can recover equation ( [ approx - morse ] ) via rwa and using equation ( [ otro - morse ] ) .",
    "in this section we numerically study the applicability of the above approximation as funtion of the system parameters .      as pointed out",
    ", solutions of the mathiue equation in closed analytical form do not exist .",
    "however , it is well known , from floquet @xcite and bloch theory @xcite , that the spectrum of a periodic operator in 1-d is determined by a continouos quantum number @xmath74 refered to as quasi momentum and a descrete number @xmath75 called band index .",
    "the spectrum is most often represented within the first brillouin zone @xcite as allowed energy bands seperated by forbidden gaps .",
    "the characteristics of the spectrum are usually , in a phenomenological way , explained in two different ways ; starting from a weak potential or a strong one . in the weak",
    "limit the particle is moving almost freely in a periodic background , which at the degenerate points split the degeneracy . in the oposite , strong potential limit ,",
    "particles with energies smaller than the potential barriers will be quasi bound , and the tunneling rate determines the width of the bound energies , band width .",
    "as soon as a particle has an energy exceeding the barriers , it will move almost freely .",
    "thus , we expect that the @xmath74-dependence is weak only for the lowest quasi bound energy bands when the amplitudes @xmath76 of the cosine potential is large .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which shows the lowest energy bands of the mathiue equation for @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath79 , within the first brillouin zone , of the mathiue equation for a potential amplitude @xmath78 and wave number @xmath77 .",
    "the cosine function is plotted for clearity , showing that within the `` wells '' the particle is quasi bound .",
    ", width=302 ]    the rwa is only supposed to work in the limit of @xmath80 , so it approximate only the lowest quasi bound energies . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we present the results of numerical calculations of the error estimete @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the approximate result for the energy from eq .",
    "( [ rwacosham ] ) , @xmath83-g_0 ^ 2\\ ] ] and @xmath84 is the numerically calculated result of the energy by diagobnalization of the truncated hamiltonian . here",
    "the size of the hamiltonian is @xmath85 ( well within the convergens limits for the eigenvalues ) .",
    "the reason why we show the absolute error , and not the relative one , is because for higher values of @xmath75 , the energies become close to zero and the relative error fluctuates greatly in such cases . in the figure",
    ", the band index @xmath75 runs between 0 and 5 , hence showing the six lowest energies , and it is clear that the approximation breaks down for small couplings @xmath76 and high exitations @xmath75 as expected .     the absolute error @xmath86 , between the rwa result and the `` exact '' numerical result , as a funtion of the band index @xmath75 and the amplitude @xmath87 .",
    "the approximation is most valid for low excited bands @xmath75 and strong couplings @xmath76 . again",
    "the wave number @xmath88 is set to unity.,width=302 ]      as the morse potential is analytically solvable , no numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian is needed .",
    "the bound energies for the morse potential are @xcite @xmath89 clearly , since @xmath68 , the second anaharmonicity term becomes crucial only for larger excitations @xmath75 .",
    "the anaharmonicity terms is purely negative resulting in that the highly excited bound states are more densly distributed .",
    "interestingly , from the rwa result of eq .",
    "( [ appmorse ] ) we note that the second term is positive making the energies to be more sparse for high @xmath75 s .",
    "however , this is partly compensated for by the coeffiecient @xmath90 infront of the first harmonic part .",
    "it should be emphasized that only the even terms in the sums ( [ sum ] ) are included since within the rwa odd terms vanishes .",
    "thus , it is expected that the method may not be as efficient as for a situation with a purely even potential @xmath91 .",
    "it is more likely that the obtained eigenvalues approximate the ones for the hamiltonian with a potential @xmath92 using that @xmath93 , we expect that the potential ( [ apppot ] ) has some kind of `` weak '' exponential behaviour . in fig .",

    "we have developed a method to approximate hamiltonians using a kind of self - rwa .",
    "we have shown how some of the involved sums may be calculated using symmetrically ordered expressions for fock - states expectation values of powers of the position operator.we have used these expressions to obtain approximations for hamiltonians corresponding to the quantum rotor and the morse potential .",
    "a discussion of the validity of the approximation was given and the relation with perturbation theory was explained . the direct link between first order perturbation theory and the rwa deepens the understanding of the two methods , and a consequent question would be if higher orders in the rwa scheeme could regain higher order perturbation theory .",
    "this seems possible , but has turned out to be more subtle than expected , mostly because of the non - commutability of the ladder operators .",
    "in this appendix we use the results of the previous sections and show how one may use it to calculate various sums . like in section[sec2 ] , no rwa is used and the results are exact .    we start with some function @xmath102 which we can expand according to @xmath103 here we have introduced the `` symmetric '' ladder operators @xmath12 and @xmath11 obeying the regular boson commutator algebra @xmath104=1 $ ] and which are related to @xmath105 and @xmath106 as @xmath107 further we have the normalized eigenstates and eigenvalues of the number operator @xmath108 ; @xmath109 , where @xmath110 , and which in @xmath111-basis are @xmath112    as argued in section [ sec2 ] , the diagonal elements , in the fock basis , of the function @xmath102 is identical to the diagonal elements of the function @xmath113 where only terms containing an equal number of creation and annihilation operators are included .",
