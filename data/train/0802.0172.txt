    "this paper is concerned with the derivation and some properties of the generalized fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) for the distribution function @xmath4 of a single stochastic variable @xmath5 , which differs from the conventional fpe by involving @xmath5-derivatives of order higher than two , @xmath6 such an equation may appear as a result of a high - order truncation of the kramers - moyal expansion of the markovian master equation  @xcite , @xmath7 in general , the naive truncation of this expansion is not a legitimate procedure , but if a problem at hand involves a small parameter @xmath8 , one can approximate the expansion by finite number of terms using an appropriate perturbation technique  @xcite . in case of brownian motion of a heavy particle of mass @xmath0 in a thermal bath of light molecules of mass @xmath9 and temperature @xmath10 ,",
    "the appropriate small parameter is the mass ratio @xmath11 . in this case , to order @xmath12 one recovers for the particle s momentum @xmath5 the conventional second - order fpe , @xmath13 while going beyond order @xmath12 leads to an equation of the form ( [ gfpe ] ) .    in rare cases when transition rates @xmath14 in the master equation ( [ me ] )",
    "are known explicitly , the derivation of the generalized fpe ( [ gfpe ] ) is fairly straightforward  @xcite , otherwise it is difficult .",
    "a popular approach engages the assumption that the fluctuating force in the corresponding langevin equation is a gaussian process . in this case perturbation analysis",
    "is not needed since the terms with derivatives of order higher than two vanish identically and one arrives at the conventional fpe ( [ fpe ] ) , which in this case is exact .",
    "however , the assumption of gaussian random force , although might seem physically reasonable , should not be taken for granted .",
    "in particular , for a brownian particle it is justified only to order @xmath12 , while corrections of higher orders are essentially non - gaussian and lead to a fpe in the generalized form ( [ gfpe ] ) .",
    "this paper is focused on the generalized fpe for the brownian particle s momentum @xmath5 to order @xmath15 which involves @xmath5-derivatives up to order four .    despite a few important contributions ( see below ) , the theory of brownian motion beyond the lowest approximation did not attract much attention in the past , perhaps because of the common belief that higher order corrections are of little importance . however , in recent years the problem has caught some new interest . beyond lowest order in @xmath8 the langevin equation for a brownian particle involves nonlinear dissipative terms , and thus corresponds to the description beyond the level of linear response theory .",
    "one might hope that the nonlinear langevin equation and the corresponding generalized fpe would enable to capture subtle effects of the interplay of noise and nonlinearity , which are completely washed out when one uses the conventional fpe or the corresponding linear langevin equation .",
    "this indeed has been demonstrated for a number of problems including brownian motors  @xcite and barrier crossing  @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty related to the generalized fpe and the corresponding nonlinear langevin equation is that these equations usually can not be constructed on a purely phenomenological basis .",
    "there is a substantial mathematical literature on the langevin equation with nonlinear dissipation terms .",
    "however , for processes with nonlinear dissipation thermodynamics provides no hints about the form of fluctuation - dissipation relations , and little progress can be made without such relations .",
    "furthermore , an attempt to go beyond the comfortable but artificial assumption of a gaussian random force leaves one , within a phenomenological framework , with no clue how to handle correlations higher than of second order .",
    "these difficulties suggest to derive the generalized fpe from as close to first principles as possible .",
    "a successful example of such derivation is the van kampen s method of system size expansion  @xcite and in particular its application for the rayleigh model of brownian motion  @xcite . in this model a brownian particle of mass @xmath0 moves in one dimension interacting with the heat bath of ideal gas molecules of mass @xmath1 and temperature @xmath10 through instantaneous binary collisions .",
    "as was mentioned above , the relevant small parameter is the mass ratio @xmath11 .",
    "since the momentum of the particle @xmath16 is on average @xmath17 times larger than that of a bath molecule , it is convenient to work with the scaled particles momentum @xmath18 which is of the same order as the thermal momentum of molecules of the bath @xmath19 .",
    "the rayleigh model is truly markovian , and the natural starting point is the master equation ( [ me ] ) for the distribution function @xmath4 , in which transition rates can be readily found explicitly under the assumption of binary particle - molecule collisions . transforming the kramers - moyal expansion into the expansion in powers of @xmath8 , one derives to order @xmath12 the conventional fpe @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a second order differential operator @xmath22 @xmath23 is the number of bath molecules per unit length , @xmath24 is the molecule s thermal momentum , and @xmath25 is the inverse temperature @xmath26 .",
    "an extension to order @xmath15 leads to the generalized fpe in the form @xmath27 where the operator @xmath28 involves derivatives up to order four , @xmath29 note that terms of order @xmath30 vanish due to symmetry . in what follows i will refer to eq .",
    "( [ vke ] ) , first obtained in  @xcite , as the van kampen equation .",
    "one can verify that the maxwellian distribution @xmath31 is the stationary solution for both the standard fpe ( [ fpe0 ] ) and the van kampen equation ( [ vke ] ) , @xmath32 however , in contrast to the conventional fpe ( [ fpe0 ] ) , the van kampen equation ( [ vke ] ) does not preserve the positivity of the solution and therefore can not be an exact equation for any stochastic process . yet , as an approximation beyond lowest order in @xmath8 , the equation ( [ vke ] ) is useful and predicts a number of qualitatively new features .",
    "for instance , while the conventional fpe ( [ fpe0 ] ) gives for the average momentum @xmath33 the closed equation @xmath34 , the van kampen equation ( [ vke ] ) predicts the coupling to the third moment @xmath35 : @xmath36 for initial conditions @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the fpe ( [ fpe0 ] ) gives @xmath39 for any @xmath40 , while the equation ( [ moment ] ) gives nonzero average momentum for a time interval @xmath41 .",
    "this prediction was discussed and confirmed by numerical simulation in  @xcite .",
    "the van kampen equation ( [ vke ] ) has been recently exploited in the context of rectification of thermal fluctuations  @xcite and to study the influence of nonlinear dissipation on the kramers escape rate  @xcite .",
    "although proved to be useful , the van kampen equation  ( [ vke ] ) is by no means general .",
    "it is derived under assumptions similar to those for the boltzmann equation , namely that a characteristic collision time @xmath42 is much shorter than all other relevant time scales ( which implies small @xmath8 ) , and that multiple collisions are negligible ( small bath s density ) .",
    "it is of interest to derive a generalized fpe from first principles keeping the former assumption , but relaxing the latter .",
    "some aspects of this problem were addressed already in pioneering works on the microscopic theory of brownian motion  @xcite and further developed in  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most elaborate work is the paper by van kampen and oppenheim  @xcite .",
    "they applied the projection operator technique directly to the liouville equation for the total particle - bath distribution function and derived a generalized fpe of order @xmath15 .",
    "the coefficients in the equation are expressed in terms of rather complicated correlation functions , and no attempt has been made to compare the result with the van kampen equation  ( [ vke ] ) .",
    "it was noted by seke  @xcite that the projection operator method , when applied to the liouville equation , involves some subtlety and may be inconsistent . the alternative way , which we shall follow in this paper , is to apply the projector operator technique directly to the equation of motion of the particle , to derive microscopically the langevin equation for the particle s momentum @xmath5 , and then to apply a standard routine  @xcite to construct a corresponding fpe for the distribution function @xmath4 .",
    "it is generally believed that the two methods of derivation , namely `` liouville @xmath43 fokker - planck '' and `` equation of motion @xmath43 langevin @xmath43 fokker - planck '' , should give the same result .",
    "to lowest order @xmath12 it is indeed the case : both methods lead to the standard second - order fpe ( [ fpe ] ) .",
    "however , we have found recently  @xcite that beyond the lowest order predictions of the two methods are different .",
    "moreover , it was found that the second method ( from langevin to fokker - planck ) leads to a generalized fpe with a rather disturbing property , namely , its stationary solution was found non - maxwellian .",
    "the intention of this paper is to follow this line in detail to obtain a generalized fpe to order @xmath15 in a complete form .",
    "the equation we arrive at , namely eq.([fpe4 ] ) in section v , involves terms linear and quadratic in the density of bath molecules @xmath44 . for a very diluted bath",
    "the latter can be neglected , and the equation is reduced to the van kampen equation ( [ vke ] ) , as expected .",
    "the results related to the terms quadratic in @xmath44 are controversial .",
    "these terms are absent in the van kampen equation for a binary collisions model , have the structure different than that in the van kampen - oppenheim approach , and make the stationary solution inconsistent with boltzmann - gibbs statistics . whether these results provide a consistent proof of weak nonergodicity of brownian motion or are merely an indication that a naive perturbation scheme does not apply beyond the markovian approximation remains an open question .",
    "as will be discussed , a direct unambiguous verification of non - ergodic effects by numerical simulation may be a non - trivial task .",
    "the possibility of deviations from the maxwellian distribution has been discussed in literature for a long time .",
    "it is known that even small deviations may be important for thermally activated processes , in particular for thermonuclear reaction rates in astrophysical plasma  @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms were proposed to justify such deviations , but in our opinion none of them are quite satisfactory .",
    "for instance , introducing a nonlinear dissipating term into the langevin equation and assuming that the fluctuating force is gaussian , one generally arrives at a second order fpe with a non - maxwellian stationary solution  @xcite .",
    "however , as we already noted , nonlinear corrections to the dissipation force for a brownian particle is of order higher than @xmath12 . in this case",
    "an accurate perturbation procedure leads to a generalized fpe of order higher than two , which is a clear indication that the assumption of gaussian random force is not justified beyond the lowest order .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sections ii and iii ,",
    "the mazur - oppenheim version of the projection operator technique is applied to derive the nonlinear langevin equation of order @xmath15 . in this part",
    "we mostly follow the previous paper  @xcite making some small yet important corrections .",
    "the corresponding generalized fpe is constructed in section iv and analyzed in section v. in section vi we present the results for the generalized rayleigh model which allows analytical evaluation of all relevant correlation functions .",
    "also , in this section the results of numerical simulation are discussed .",
    "summarizing remarks are collected in section vii .",
    "consider a structureless brownian particle of mass @xmath0 immersed in a thermal bath comprised of molecules of mass @xmath9 .",
    "it is assumed that the mass ratio @xmath11 is small and that the bath is initially in equilibrium at temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the aim of this and the next sections is to derive the langevin equation for the particle to order @xmath15 .",
    "as will be shown , such an equation involves a nonlinear correction to the damping term , which is cubic in the particle s momentum .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath45 here @xmath46 and @xmath47 are positions and momenta of bath molecules , @xmath48 and @xmath16 are those of the brownian particle , @xmath49 is the hamiltonian of the bath in the field of the brownian particle fixed at @xmath48 , and the potential @xmath50 describes the intermolecular interaction and the interaction between molecules and the particle . to simplify notations",
    "we shall consider a one - dimensional problem .",
    "the coupling of the particle with hydrodynamic modes of the bath will be neglected , in which case the extension to higher dimensions is simple .    as was already noted , it is convenient to work with the scaled momentum of the particle @xmath18 , since this quantity on average is expected to be of the same order as the typical momentum of a bath molecule @xmath51 .",
    "writing the liouville operator @xmath52 in terms of @xmath5 has the advantage of extracting the small parameter @xmath8 explicitly , @xmath53 here @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the forces on the _ i_-th bath molecule and on the brownian particle , respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath56 corresponds to the hamiltonian @xmath49 and governs dynamics of the bath in the field of the brownian particle which is fixed at @xmath48 . since @xmath57 one might expect that the force @xmath58 exerted by the bath on the particle is close to the force on a fixed particle ( pressure ) , @xmath59 this intuition is implemented in the mazur - oppenheim approach  @xcite using the projection operator @xmath60 which averages a dynamical variable @xmath61 over the canonical distribution @xmath62 , for bath variables at @xmath63 , @xmath64 the idea is to decompose the total force @xmath65 on the particle into a zero centered fluctuating ( `` random '' ) and a regular ( `` dissipative '' ) parts . using the operator identity @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    ", one may decompose the force @xmath69 as follows @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the factor @xmath73 in the integral in eq .",
    "( [ randomforce ] ) can be simplified taking into account the orthogonality of @xmath74 and @xmath56 ( @xmath75 ) , and the equality @xmath76 which can be verified by integration by parts . as a result , one can write the equation of motion for the scaled momentum @xmath77 in the form  @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a fluctuating force obeying @xmath80 .",
    "the equation ( [ em ] ) is exact but hardly instructive .",
    "to get some progress one needs to expand the fluctuating force @xmath81 in powers of @xmath8 , @xmath82 using the identity ( [ identity ] ) one obtains @xmath83 in contrast to the pressure @xmath84 , the higher order corrections @xmath85 and @xmath86 depend on the particle s momentum @xmath5 .",
    "seeking an equation for @xmath87 , one needs to extract this dependence explicitly : @xmath88 here the functions @xmath89 are defined as follows @xmath90 and the operator @xmath91 is @xmath92 the functions @xmath89 do not depend on the particle momentum @xmath5 and , as we shall see , all coefficients in the @xmath15-order generalized fpe can be expressed in terms of correlation functions of @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "let us now return to the exact equation of motion eq.([em ] ) and expand the correlation @xmath96 to order @xmath12 , @xmath97 note that @xmath98 due to symmetry . using ( [ f12 ] ) , one can write the above equation in the following form @xmath99 where @xmath100    in the above equations , cumulants @xmath101 are defined in a usual way , i.e. as a part of the correlation @xmath102 which can not be reduced to the product of correlations of lower order",
    ". we shall need correlations and cumulants up to order four , which are related to each other as follows : @xmath103 the important property of cumulants of functions @xmath89 is that they are linear in the concentration of bath molecules @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath104 this may be demonstrated noticing that @xmath89 is a linear functional of cumulants for the density of bath particles @xmath105 , where @xmath106 denotes the coordinate - momentum pair @xmath107 of a bath particle . in turn",
    ", one can observe that cumulants @xmath108 of any order @xmath109 depend linearly on the concentration of bath molecules @xmath44 .",
    "for instance , in the expression for the product @xmath110 one can write the double sum as @xmath111 which gives @xmath112 here the second term on the right side is by definition the cumulant @xmath113 and is obviously linear in @xmath44 .    substituting the expansion ( [ kernel_exp ] ) into the equation of motion ( [ em ] ) one arrives at a nonlinear and non - markovian langevin equation of order @xmath15",
    ", @xmath114 here the memory kernels are @xmath115 and the fluctuating force @xmath116 involves three components , @xmath117 where @xmath84 is the fluctuating pressure , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are defined by eqs.([f12 ] ) . the zero - mean term @xmath118 is discarded because to order @xmath15 it does not contribute to correlations of the fluctuating force @xmath116 .",
    "the relative importance of memory effects described by the non - markovian langevin equation ( [ nmle ] ) depends on how fast the particle s momentum @xmath87 evolves on the time scale @xmath42 for the decay of the memory kernels @xmath119 and @xmath120 . in what follows",
    "we shall assume that the characteristic time @xmath42 does exist .",
    "this assumption is not satisfied , for example , for the rubin s model ( a heavy impurity embedded in the harmonic chain ) where @xmath120 is identically zero , and @xmath119 decays with time as a power law .",
    "it is known , however , that in many cases long - tail effects are indeed negligible for sufficiently small @xmath8 , although the justification may require rather subtle argument  @xcite    the memory kernels @xmath121 are expressed in terms of correlation functions @xmath122 which do not depend on @xmath8 .",
    "then the characteristic decay time of the kernels does not depend on @xmath8 either , @xmath123 . on the other hand , as follows from eq.([nmle ] ) , the characteristic time for relaxation of the particle s momentum @xmath124 is of order @xmath125 and thus expected to be much longer than @xmath42 .",
    "this suggests that the non - markovian equation ( [ nmle ] ) can be expanded in powers of @xmath8 about its markovian limit .",
    "one way to make such an expansion is to use in eq .",
    "( [ nmle ] ) the following substitution  @xcite @xmath126 the main contributions to the integrals in eq.([nmle ] ) come from the region @xmath127 . for such @xmath128 the integral term in the right - hand side of eq.([trick ] )",
    "is of order @xmath129 .",
    "then the nonlinear dissipative term in the langevin equation ( [ nmle ] ) can be written in the local form @xmath130 to order @xmath15 this justifies the markovian ansatz for the nonlinear dissipative term @xmath131 here the upper integration limit in the right - hand side is taken to infinity since we restrict ourselves to the coarse - grain description on the time scale much longer than the characteristic time for bath fluctuations , @xmath132 .",

    "the result ( [ delta ] ) may be also obtained in a more direct way expanding @xmath149 about @xmath150 : @xmath151 to evaluate this expression to order @xmath15 one needs derivatives @xmath152 to order @xmath12 .",
    "the first derivative is given by the linear langevin equation ( [ le0 ] ) , while for derivatives of higher order eq.([le0 ] ) gives : @xmath153 .",

    "recall that @xmath28 and @xmath213 scale differently with the molecular density @xmath23 : @xmath271 , @xmath272 .",
    "this suggests that for sufficiently high density , the operator @xmath28 can be dropped . inspecting eqs.([d4_binary ] ) and ( [ c12_m ] )",
    ", one finds that the ratio of terms generated by @xmath213 to those produced by @xmath28 is of order @xmath273 this is an important parameter of the problem and has a meaning of average number of molecules simultaneously interacting with the particle . for the case",

    "zoomed data shown in the inset suggest that the stationary value exceeds the maxwellian average @xmath284 . ]",
    "we attempted to verify this prediction in a numerical experiment using a simulation setup similar to that described in detail in  @xcite . in our simulation",
    "two poissonian sources of in - going molecules are located sufficiently far from the particle to mimic an infinite thermal bath with a maxwellian velocity distribution of molecules . the particle s position is initially fixed and the bath is allowed to equilibrate in the field of the fixed particle for a time @xmath285 . then , at the moment @xmath63 the particle is released with an initial velocity @xmath286 , and the relaxation of the mean - square velocity @xmath287 towards its stationary value is calculated .",
    "1 shows the result for the mass ratio @xmath288 and the density of the bath corresponding to @xmath280 .",
    "the velocity is in units of the thermal velocity of bath molecules @xmath289 , so that according to equilibrium statistical mechanics @xmath287 should approach the equilibrium value @xmath279 .",
    "instead , the stationary mean - square velocity of the particle appears to be slightly higher .",
    "however , the exceeding is less than @xmath290 percent which is orders of magnitude lower than predicted by eq.([pred ] ) .",
    "the smallness of the alleged deviation from the maxwellian average requires very large number of sampling runs , which in our case was about @xmath291 .",
    "also , the result seems to be sensitive to the value of the integration time step @xmath292 .",
    "we used the velocity verlet algorithm with @xmath293 in units of the collision time @xmath282 .",
    "simulations with larger @xmath292 show no signs of deviations from maxwellian statistics .",
    "in this paper the fokker - planck equation for the brownian particle is attempted to be derived beyond the lowest order in the mass ratio @xmath11 . unlike the approach of van kampen and oppenheim  @xcite , the projection operator technique was applied to the equation of motion for the particle , rather than to the liouville equation .",
    "the results seem both encouraging and controversial .    on the one hand ,",
    "the van kampen equation , originally designed for the special case of instantaneous collisions , is recovered from first principles for a low - density bath .",
    "therefore , in the markovian limit the method is correct .",
    "on the other hand , it is found that in general case the equation contains the additional operator @xmath294 originating from non - markovian corrections which are inevitable for any model with finite collision time .",
    "these corrections are found to make the stationary solution non - maxwellian , @xmath238 , which is , of course , a very disturbing result .",
    "brownian motion of a massive particle coupled to an infinite bath in thermal equilibrium , with the maxwellian velocity distribution for bath molecules , is often considered as a classical example of an ergodic process : all accessible microstates are equally probable over a long period of time , and therefore the equilibrium state is the gibbs canonical ensemble . to order @xmath12 this anticipation",
    "is supported by solutions of both langevin and fokker - planck equations . to order @xmath15 ,",
    "the original rayleigh model with instantaneous collisions leads to the van kampen equation which also has the maxwellian stationary solution .",
    "note that in this last case the ergodic behavior can not be deduced from the central limit theorem or the assumption of gaussian noise imposed on the langevin equation ( which predict the fpe of second order ) .",
    "instead , one can show that the van kampen equation is equivalent to a master equation with transition rates obeying the detailed balance condition  @xcite .",
    "as well known , in this case the applicability of boltzmann - gibbs statistics can be readily proved  @xcite . however ,",
    "whether or not the detailed balance holds in general case is not known , and a truly dynamical justification of boltzmann - gibbs statistics still seems to be missing  @xcite .",
    "a number of generalizations of boltzmann - gibbs statistics has been discussed in recent years , including those derived directly from underlying dynamics ( see for instance  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , these generalizations usually imply an essential departure from basic assumptions of boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics such as inelastic collisions , nonextensivity , lvy statistics for the bath , etc .",
    "in contrast , the result @xmath238 originates merely from finite duration of collisions , which suggests deviations from boltzmann - gibbs statistics under a much wider range of conditions .",
    "this radical prediction is in contradiction with the results of van kampen and oppenheim  @xcite .",
    "they obtained a generalized fpe in which the operator @xmath295 ( in our notations ) has the form of @xmath21 squared , and therefore the stationary solution is maxwellian .",
    "this casts some scepticism about the ability of the perturbation approach exploited in this paper to treat non - markovian effects .",
    "the method is based on the seemingly straightforward assumption of wide separation of time scales for the particle s momentum @xmath296 and for correlation functions of the fluctuating force @xmath297 . however , for a finite @xmath8 , the relation @xmath298 is not necessarily true , even if the coupling with slow bath s collective modes is negligible  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the van kampen - oppenheim approach also relies on the assumption @xmath299 , and it is not clear why the two approaches give different results .",
    "numerical simulations of the generalized rayleigh model apparently suggest some deviation from the maxwellian statistics , but much smaller than the theory predicts .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the presented theory is asymptotic and implies the weak coupling limit , which is difficult to approach in a numerical experiment .",
    "one may hope that further , more accurate numerical modeling would shed some light on these questions .",
    "this work was partly supported by nserc .",
    "in this appendix we prove the relation ( [ relation ] ) : @xmath251 . using the definition of @xmath241 and @xmath242 , eq.([c12 ] ) , the relation can be written in the form @xmath300 or taking the derivative @xmath301 asymptotic relations ( [ relation2 ] ) and ( [ relation3 ] ) are equivalent but the latter is easier to prove .",
    "let us evaluate two integrals in the left hand side of the relation ( [ relation3 ] ) .",
    "consider the first integral @xmath302 .",
    "recalling the definition of @xmath303 @xmath304 one can write @xmath305 introducing the function @xmath306 the above expression can be written as follows @xmath307 noticing that @xmath308 , it is convenient to integrate the last term by parts : @xmath309    consider now the second integral in the left hand side of ( [ relation3 ] ) @xmath310 since @xmath311 the symbol of absolute value may be omitted , and a change of variables gives @xmath312 evaluation of the derivatives gives @xmath313 integrating by parts , the last term in this expression can be presented in the form @xmath314 so finally for @xmath315 one obtains @xmath316    together with ( [ i1 ] ) this gives for the left hand side of relation ( [ relation3 ] ) @xmath317 in the limit @xmath181 the first term in this expression vanishes , while the second and the third terms both equal @xmath318 : @xmath319 but this is just the right hand side of the relation ( [ relation3 ] ) , which thus is proved .",
