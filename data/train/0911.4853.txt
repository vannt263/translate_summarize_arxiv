    "nevertheless , it is highly unlikely that observations in such different ranges are coeval .",
    "so we try to understand whether , and for which purposes , the variability can be considered a second - order effect , particularly for those objects known to have had outburst episodes , i.e. displaying the largest flux variations .",
    "we wonder whether the collection of data ranging from radio to uv , and belonging to a temporal interval that in some cases is as wide as a decade or more , might still be reliable to model the seds .",
    "the first step has been to look at the literature , in order to understand how the community faces this fairly common problem .",
    "we have found that several interesting results about radio and ir flux correlations were found out assembling observations taken within a temporal range of several years ( e.g. wright & allen 1978 ; seaquist et al .",
    "for instance , the seds of the jet emission from r aqr and ch cyg systems were built up by collecting data points taken in the years 1989 - 2002 ( galloway & sokoloski 2004 , fig .",
    "4 ) . moreover , a study based on mir observations of the ss ch cyg ( biller et al .",
    "2006 ) surprisingly found that data taken at very different epochs ( e.g. iras psc , iras lrs , iso , photometric points from taranova & shevranin 2000 , 2004 and bogdanov & taranova 2001 ) are in good agreement with each other , despite ch cyg being known as a variable ss which has gone through several outburst episodes even in the recent past .",
    "the radio band deserves a special discussion : first , because the radio observations come from the 70 and 80 surveys , well before the iso mission ; second , because it is known that in sss the radio emission can be significantly variable ( seaquist et al .",
    "1984 , 1993 ) , even more than in the ir .",
    "a study by matthews & karovska ( 2006 ) of the near system o ceti ( spatially resolved for the first time thanks to the very large array ) , has shown that radio variability has not altered the flux densities by more than 30% during the past 8.5 yr . furthermore , an analysis of the continuum emission data at @xmath2 and @xmath3 wavelengths by ivison et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , spanning a period of @xmath0 4 years , has demonstrated that virtually all the objects of their large sample show flux density variations within a factor of 5 .",
    "translated in sed diagrams ( see @xmath44 ) , this implies a vertical shift which still allows to discern between the main emission processes arising from the symbiotic nebul ( bremsstrahlung and synchrotron ) .",
    "an interesting example of this is given by ch cyg , which in the late 80s showed bremsstrahlung and in the middle 90s synchrotron emission in the radio range ( contini et al .",
    "summarizing , we can confidently state , on the basis of current literature , that symbiotic variability does not modify the general properties of such systems as much as to invalidate our approach .",
    "whatever the case , we would like to verify this assumption directly , by fully exploiting the data for the unfortunately few , well studied objects composing our sample .",
    "we have thus started verifying the agreement between the iras and iso flux levels , although there is a time delay of @xmath015 years . moreover ,",
    "whenever possible , we have also tried to join the iras and iso spectra to the nir observations coming from long - lived photometric surveys : in some cases ( as for hm sge and v1016 cyg ) we have assembled a sed composed by data taken within a temporal range not larger than @xmath010 days , from the u band to the upper edge ( @xmath045 ) of the iso - sws spectrum !",
    "obviously , in this case the flux agreement is excellent .",
    "finally , some objects were observed by iso - sws more than once during its lifetime , making possible a direct comparison of the mir spectral variability over different ( tough unknown ) mira pulsation phases . in fig .",
    "[ fig : var ] we plot the iso - sws spectra for three well - studied sss . despite some known instrumental effects , such as the sudden worsening of the spectrum quality longwards of @xmath028   due to the mediocre performance of the sws band 3e at 27.5 - 29 ) we can recognize some interesting general trends .",
    "the strongest flux variations , whose relative ratio is not larger than a factor of 0.6 , arise from the cool star emission that dominates up to @xmath0 5 - 6 .",
    "the dust thermal emission ( although not constant ) varies within @xmath0 0.3 - 0.4 : this variability , as we discuss in sect .",
    "3 , does not alter significantly our estimates of the dust shell sizes .",
    "for instance , by modelling the different iso spectra for hm sge , we find that the inferred dust shell size at @xmath01000k varies by a factor @xmath51.1 , and the at @xmath0380k by a factor @xmath51.2 .",
    "similarly , for v1016 cyg , we find a variation of @xmath01.1 for both the shells , well within the assumed uncertainty of our method .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    , scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in the past years , theoretical models as well as observations have shown that in sss both the hot and cool stars lose mass through strong stellar winds that collide within and outside the system , hence creating a complex network of wakes and shock fronts that result in a complicated structure of gas and dust nebulae ( nussbaumer 2000 ) .",
    "this shock network results from the interaction of the fast wd wind with the slow , dense outflow from the mira , and corresponds to the colliding wind configuration of girard & willson ( 1987 ) , which is a theoretical basis to the more realistic picture of shock fronts disrupted by hydrodynamic instabilities .    in the light of this scenario",
    ", one can consider that two shock - fronts develop from the collision of the winds between the stars ( girard & willson 1987 , kenny & taylor 2005 ) : one strong shock - front facing the wd ( the reverse shock ) and the other weak one facing the red giant .",
    "similarly , in the extended circumbinary region , two shock fronts develop from the head - on - back collision of the winds : one expanding outwards and the second , virtually negligible , facing the system center ( see the sketch presented by contini et al .",
    "2009c , fig .",
    "2 ) . in the following ,",
    "we refer to the two main shock fronts : namely , the reverse between the stars and the expanding outwards the system .",
    "the expanding shock front is disrupted by collision with the ism inhomogeneities .",
    "the gas entering the shock front is thermalized up to a maximum temperature of t=1.5 10@xmath6 ( /100 ) @xmath7 ( where  is the shock velocity ) in the region immediately behind the discontinuity .",
    "a high temperature zone appears in the downstream region .",
    "then , the gas recombines following a relatively high cooling rate due to the high pre - shock densities characteristic of symbiotic nebulae and to compression downstream .    in the calculation code suma",
    ", the downstream region is cut in many plane - parallel slabs in order to follow as smoothly as possible the trend of the physical conditions , particularly , the temperature .",
    "the calculations of the fluxes in the different slabs of the gas downstream is shown in fig .",
    "2 in the case of hm sge , starting by the slabs at higher temperatures .",
    "shock velocities can reach @xmath8 400 in the region between the stars by head - on collision of the winds ( paper i ) .",
    "the high temperatures downstream lead to emission in the high frequency domain up to x - rays . on the other hand",
    ", the radiation from the wd , even at outburst , heats the gas to no more than 1 - 3 10@xmath9 k in a relatively large zone downstream , leading to the bump in the optical range and to the high bremsstrahlung for 10@xmath10 @xmath5 @xmath11 @xmath5 10@xmath12 hz .",
    "the input parameters of the code are those relative to the shock : the pre - shock density , _ 0 _ , the shock velocity , _ _ , the pre - shock magnetic field , _ 0 _ , and those relative to photoionization : the hot star ionizing radiation flux and its colour temperature _ _ .",
    "the abundances of he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar and fe , relative to h , the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath13 and the geometrical thickness of the nebulae @xmath14 , are also accounted for . + the key parameter is obviously the shock velocity , . for high - velocity shocks ,",
    "the very high temperature reached in the post - shock region leads to the x - ray emission observed in several sss .",
    "moreover , broad strong lines can also be observed along the whole electromagnetic spectrum , particularly the coronal lines in the infrared ( paper i ) : therefore , from the spectral point of view , different line profiles trace different velocity regimes , allowing to highlight the different physical conditions within a ss .",
    "the dust grains are heated both radiatively by the primary and secondary radiation flux from the hot star and from hot gas downstream , respectively , and collisionally by the gas in each slab downstream . in a shock - dominated regime ,",
    "collisional processes dominate and the grains can reach relatively high temperatures .",
    "the intensity of the dust re - radiation emission peak depends strongly on the dust - to - gas ratio , while the frequency corresponding to the peak depends on the shock velocity .",
    "furthermore , since the matter is highly inhomogeneous at the shock fronts because of instabilities at the fluid interface ( e.g. the rayleigh - taylor , kelvin - helmholtz , meshkov - richtmyer ) , different physical conditions should be accounted for in each one of the symbiotic system , particularly regarding the density ( e.g. in bi cru - contini et al .",
    "in this paper we deal with the continuum sed of a sample of d - type sss .",
    "the data in the x - ray , uv , optical , ir , and radio ranges are modelled by the free - bound and free- free flux ( hereafter bremsstrahlung ) calculated consistently by each model .",
    "the ir continuum sed in sss give some direct information about the system components , in particular , of the dust shells .",
    "moreover , in the ir range , reprocessed radiation by dust grains coexisting with the gas in the nebulae is accounted for .",
    "it was found by modelling previous sss that the peak of dust re - radiation calculated consistently with bremsstrahlung seldom emerges over it , adopting even high @xmath13 ratios .",
    "the seds in the ir are explained by the summed fluxes from dust at different temperatures , which are well recognizable , indicating that they most likely correspond to different shells .    in the radio and in the x - ray ranges ,",
    "the continuum accounts for the emission from the shocked nebulae .",
    "the wd flux appears in some objects in the u band and in the uv range , even if the shocked nebulae also contribute ( see contini et al .",
    "2009c for detailed modelling ) .",
    "the continuum sed of sss gives more direct informations about the system components than the line spectra do .",
    "however the latter are more constraining the models .",
    "for instance , the relative chemical abundances for each model can be found out modelling the line ratios , while only dramatic changes in the abundances of carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen , that are strong coolants , can strongly alter the continuum sed .    since the observations are taken at the earth , while the models are calculated at the nebula , to compare the models with the data , we define the factor @xmath15 = ( _ ff _",
    "r / d)@xmath7 , where r is the distance of the nebula from the ss center , d the distance to earth , and _ ff _  the filling factor .",
    "the @xmath15 factors , depending on the distance of the nebulae from the system center , not only constrain the models but also provide precious informations about the radius of shocked nebulae and dust shells within the system .    the results of modelling for single objects",
    "are presented in the next section .",
    "for some objects of the sample ( i.e. rr tel , hm sge , r aqr , h1 - 36 , and bi cru ) we already analyzed in detail the emission line spectra in previous papers .",
    "therefore , for the sake of consistency and also to verify the validity of our results about the continuum , we use the models consistently calculated on the basis of the emission line ratios .",
    "we are also aware that in the last years new data have appeared ; moreover , the suma code has been updated .",
    "therefore , we have also run new models based on those previously adopted which take into account the new features . for the other objects which either have been less observed or for which we have not considered explicitly the emission line spectra ( v627cas , v835cen , ss38 and v1016 cyg ) we have used as a basis the main models which explained the sed of other objects , adopting always one model representing the shocked nebula downstream of the reverse shock between the stars , and the other representing the expanding shock .",
    "dust shells with different temperatures were discovered by the detailed modelling of single d - type sss ( e.g. paper i , angeloni et al .",
    "2007b , contini et al .",
    "2009b )    according to hydrodynamic model atmospheres , the mira variable pulsations lift up matter from the stellar surface and extend it to the atmosphere , which is modified by the shock waves created by stellar pulsations .",
    "locally , the passing shocks cause a temporary variation of the thermodynamical conditions , influencing the formation of molecules and dust grains ( hoefner 2009 ) .",
    "in fact the shock waves lead to a levitation of the stellar atmosphere , providing a cool and dense environment as required for an efficient formation and growth of dust grains .",
    "the newly formed grains are accelerated by the stellar radiation field and initiate a slow massive outflow by transferring momentum to the surrounding gas .",
    "more particularly , while the interaction of a particle with a gravitational field depends solely on the particle mass , its interaction with a radiation field depends on its composition , structure , size , and density , as well as on the radiation wavelength .",
    "thus , if in the outer layers of a star there are particles that are exceptionally absorbent at the leading wavelength of the photon -as determined by the temperature - then for these particles the radiation pressure might just overcome gravity ( prialnik 2000 )",
    ". the result would be an outer acceleration leading to a mass outflow of such particles and other entrained by them .",
    "these particles are accelerated by the radiation pressure . consequently a dust shell is ejected from the star .",
    "the dust shells can then be destroyed by evaporation , when the grains reach temperatures @xmath16 1200 k , or by sputtering of the grains throughout strong shocks .",
    "in addition ir observations have shown the existence of a cool emission component which indicates dusty circumstellar material .",
    "we would like to investigate in detail the dust - to - gas ratio by mass in the shells .",
    "this is an interesting issue , not only in the specific case of symbiotic systems , but in the understanding of ir emission from starburst galaxies and luminous ir galaxies ( e. g. contini & contini 2007 ) , which is generally attributed to supernovae ( e. g. dweck 1987 ) .",
    "moreover , extinction increases with dust mass and dust is created in the atmosphere of the giant star . on the other hand",
    ", the grains can not survive close to the wd because they evaporate at temperatures @xmath16 1500 k. so extinction of the mira is generally greater than that of the wd in several sss ( one can notice it in h1 - 36 and hm sge also looking at our fig .",
    "4 , where the cool star is virtually unnecessary in modelling the data around log@xmath1714.5 . ) .",
    "however , in a system observed edge - on the wd is periodically occulted by the red giant star and by the network of shocked nebulae created by collision of the winds .",
    "this leads to complex light curves as those observed from e.g. ch cyg .",
    "previous models for circumstellar shells deals with isolated stars .",
    "for instance young et al .",
    "( 1993 ) adopt a simple model of shell evolution , involving the interaction of the expelled material with the ism . for oxygen",
    "rich mirae , the models of le sidaner & le bertre ( 1996 ) consider a dust shell surrounding a central star which radiates as a black body .",
    "all the models lead to dust temperatures @xmath16 800 k.    our model is similar to that used for the shells in the ch cyg system ( contini et al .",
    "2009c ) , namely , the dust+gas shell moves outwards the mira and a shock front forms on the external edge .",
    "the radiation flux from the hot star reaches the shell on the shock front .",
    "we proceed as for the nebulae , considering many downstream slabs and calculating the physical conditions in each of them .",
    "radiation is calculated by radiation transfer throughout the different slabs .",
    "we adopt a shock velocity of @xmath0 30 .",
    "the shocks form by head - on collision of the shell with the wind from the wd between the stars and by head - on - back collision with the giant wind or by collision with the interstellar matter beyond the binary system .",
    "the code suma is used for the calculations .",
    "the other significant input parameters used for the calculations are 0=6 10@xmath18 3 , 0=3 10@xmath19 gauss , similar to those adopted by contini et al .",
    "( 2009c , table 1 ) .",
    "the results show that dust grains are heated to @xmath0 1000 k collisionally by the gas which reaches temperature t@xmath0 10@xmath9 k throughout the shock front and downstream .",
    "recall that shells with dust temperatures of @xmath0 1000 k are present in late - type stars ( danchi et al .",
    "1994 ) as well as in sss , showing that collisional heating dominates .",
    "the radiation from the wd will most easily destroy the grains by heating them beyond the evaporation critical temperature ( @xmath0 1500 k ) .",
    "the best fit to r aqr continuum sed in the ir ( fig .",
    "3 ) is obtained by @xmath13 by mass @xmath16 0.1 , which is of the order of the dust - to - gas ratios found in sn and by a factor of @xmath0 10@xmath20 higher than in the ism .    the reprocessed emission by dust is well reproduced by the black body ( bb ) flux at 1000 k because only the first few slabs of the shell close to the shock front , emit a strong flux . in the following slabs ,",
    "the grain temperature rapidly decreases following the high cooling rate of the gas .",
    "so , generally , the emission from a shell is well approximated by a bb flux at a certain temperature . in the following ,",
    "we represent the shell emissions by bb fluxes at the temperature best fitting the data in the continuum sed .    beyond the mira , on the side opposite to the wd , the shock accompanying the shell accelerates throughout the decreasing density slope in the mira extended atmosphere . at = 100 and 0=2 10@xmath21 3",
    "the grains are collisionally heated to @xmath0 440 k , as observed in different objects .",

    "the mira temperature is approximated by t=2500 k. interestingly , this is the only case where just one dust shell ( at t=1000k ) is evident from the ir data .",
    "the data are not enough to permit to understand whether a cooler shell is actually present , or if r aqr is a peculiar system under this aspect . +",
    "a consistent understanding of the symbiotic phenomenon has been possible only after their binary nature was acknowledged . moreover , the study of dust grains and , in general , of dust shell properties in sss is interesting not only in itself , but also in the light of sss as colliding - wind systems , namely systems where shocks are at work .",
    "we thus have the unique opportunity of studying in a relatively small region both dust condensation and destruction processes , as well as the mutual interaction of grains with a very dynamic ambient gas .",
    "the results of dust features in sss are given in a previous paper ( paper i ) .",
    "after having briefly described the single objects one by one , we would like to investigate some common properties that appear evident in our analysis .",
    "this can be done because we can apply to the continuum sed from the nebulae , the solutions of the calculations used for modelling the line spectra .",
    "they are unique because the line ratios are strongly constraining . the models are further cross - checked comparing the calculated fluxes with the observed absolute fluxes .",
    "this leads , for instance , to the calculation of the radius of the nebulae which must be compatible with the geometrical dimensions of the system ( e.g. the binary separation for the reverse shock , etc ) .",
    "there is strong evidence that virtually all sss of the sample have at least two dust shells , at about `` standard '' temperatures .",
    "it can be asked whether are there two dust shells or dust with a range of temperatures . considering single agb stars , it seems that there is a monotonic continuity of grain temperature profiles , starting from the highest value defined by the dust temperature at the condensation radius .",
    "we could refer more properly to dust within a temperature range . in sss , on the other side",
    ", the colliding - wind binary nature of the system causes a real discontinuity in the dust spatial distribution ( e.g. more than a single dust shell ) since the wd radiation field and shocks modify the local physical conditions , in some cases even preventing ( paper i ) or altering ( angeloni et al .",
    "2007c ) the dust condensation sequence .",
    "two peaks are generally directly recognizable from the sed",
    ". other peaks between them , corresponding to intermediate temperatures , would be less intense in order to be unseen .",
    "lower fluxes would correspond to radii smaller than that of the hot dust shell .",
    "this is unsuitable to a smooth distribution of dust temperatures with radii .",
    "actually the theoretical models predict the shell temperatures and radii by the direct comparison with the sed observational data .",
    "it can be noticed from the diagrams in fig .",
    "4 , that the dust thermal emission emerges from the sed profile as an infrared excess easily recognizable as a black body like bump corresponding to t@xmath01000 k. moreover , a cooler dust shell ( t@xmath0 400 k ) often appears , while dust reprocessed radiation from the shocked nebulae seldom emerges over the bremsstrahlung .",
    "the shell radii are obtained by adjusting the results of consistent modelling ( table [ tab : res ] ) to the continuum _ absolute _ fluxes observed at earth . comparing dust shell sizes with the most likely values reported in the literature for symbiotic binary separation",
    ", it seems that the hottest ( t@xmath0 1000k ) dust shells are the `` classic '' circumstellar shells known to surround mira and other agb stars , while the coolest ( t@xmath1 400k ) ones are likely to be circumbinary structures , namely they surround the whole system .",
    "this seems to be a peculiar feature of d - type systems .",
    "the 1000 k shell would always be distinguishable , because it is actually an expanding dusty envelope somehow `` detached '' from the star itself : in fact , the suitable physical and chemical conditions for grain formation are usually reached beyond a few stellar radii ( see e.g. danchi et al .",
    "moreover , we have tried to demonstrate that the coolest dust shell is mainly circumbinary , and clearly recognizable on the sed only if the dust grains survive sputtering and evaporation .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss some further correlations which highlight specific features of dust shells in sss , e.g. the luminosity of symbiotic dust shells , the links between temperature of dust and radius of the corresponding shell , also in comparison with a sample of other dusty stars .",
    "eventually , we have looked for any relations between dust shell radii and orbital periods .",

    "some further speculations have been proposed also for the quite rare d-type objects ( zamanov et al .",
    "2006 ) , but no definite results exist for d - types . for these dusty objects",
    ", there are just rough constraints about binary separation based on dynamical considerations ( i.e. hosting a mira giant forces the system to have an orbital period of at least some decades of years ) and , in any case , the uncertainties in several basic parameters are too large .    nonetheless , we would like to investigate how the dust shells periodically ejected by the mira feel the influence of the compact , much hotter object . presumably , the very circumstellar region around the wd is dust - free , because grains can not survive such high temperatures ( munari et al .",
    "in contrast , the region of the mira facing the center of the system might not be so disturbed by the diluted wd radiation field as to prevent the condensation of dust grains , because of the large binary separation .",
    "another aspect that must be taken into account is the turbulent character of the interbinary colliding - wind regions , which leads to sputtering rather than evaporation , as the most important grain destruction mechanism ( paper i ) .    in order to find out if the symbiotic character influences also the dust shell parameters , we investigate the correlation between the dust shell radii , as calculated by the sed modelling , and the orbital periods as reported in literature for some objects of our sample . fig .",
    "[ fig : orb ] shows that , within the error bars , a significant trend is recognizable : _ the longer the orbital period , the larger the shell radii . _",
    "even though these results can not be quantified yet ( our sample is not statistically significant and uncertainties in several basic parameters are too large ) , this correlation looks meaningful enough to encourage further investigations .",
    "eventually , a last consideration is common to figs .",

    "the representing points of the dust shell radius lie in two distinct regions of the diagrams : the first one , at log r @xmath1 14.7 , populated by the hottest shells , and the other one at log r @xmath8 15 , by the coolest ones .",
    "interestingly , the gap in the shell radius distribution overlaps the median strip corresponding to the typical binary separation for d - type ss .",
    "this indicates that dust grains can not condensate , or easily evaporates , along the wd orbit where the radiation field of the hot component is too harsh for grain survival .",
    "the presence of a companion star splits the system into two regions , an interbinary one and a circumbinary .",
    "the interbinary region is filled by the shell surrounding the mira and expands with a velocity of about 30 , hence reaching a distance of about 10@xmath41 cm in a very short time ( @xmath0 1 year ) with respect to the orbital period , and then expands outwards .",
    "close to the wd the dust grains are easily evaporated , hence causing the gap in the distribution of dust throughout the system .",
    "this is reflected by the distribution of the shell radii in fig .",
    "[ fig : danchi ] .",
    "when the shell reaches a distance of 10@xmath12 cm , its mass , calculated by the mass loss rate ( m@xmath42 @xmath0 10@xmath43 assuming m=10@xmath44 /y ) , is of the same order of the mass swept up from the circumstellar region ( m@xmath45 @xmath0 1.3 10@xmath43 , adopting a shell geometrical thickness of 10@xmath46 cm and a gas density of 10@xmath21 3 ) , therefore , the shell will lose any identity by merging with the interstellar medium .",
