    "the time evolution of the state of an isolated quantum mechanical system is governed by the schrdinger equation .",
    "if the system is subjected to a measurement , the state of the system collapses onto an eigenstate of the measured observable , and the measurement outcome is the corresponding eigenvalue . instead of performing a measurement directly on the system , one may also allow the system to interact with an auxiliary system , which is then subjected to a measurement .",
    "this measurement procedure reveals only partial information on the state of the original system and is very useful in protocols to prepare a system in a certain quantum mechanical state and to achieve quantum nondemolition measurements of an observable .",
    "the system could for instance be clouds of atoms or few atoms that are probed with a beam of light @xcite or an electromagnetic field mode in a cavity probed with a beam of atoms @xcite .    when a system interacts with the surroundings , it is not practical to keep track of the complete state of both system and surroundings , and instead the degrees of freedom of the surroundings are traced out . in this case",
    "the state of the system is no longer pure and must be described by a density operator , whose time evolution is determined by the master equation . for a system subjected to indirect measurements ,",
    "the time evolution depends on the actual outcomes of the measurements , and since these are probabilistic in nature , they are handled mathematically by introducing stochastic variables into the master equation .",
    "this allows one to calculate both the state of the system conditioned on a given set of measurement outcomes ( a given realization of the stochastic variables ) and the probability to observe that particular sequence of measurement results @xcite .",
    "the stochastic master equation is often derived in very general settings , and it has been shown that all master equations must be on the so - called lindblad form @xcite in order to preserve complete positivity of the density operator .",
    "the generality is , however , achieved at the cost of introduction of abstract measurement operators and measurement strengths .",
    "in contrast , in the present paper we assume a concrete measurement scheme and derive the stochastic master equation directly from known physical interactions .",
    "the system under consideration is placed inside a cavity and probed with electromagnetic radiation by sending photons into the cavity from one side and performing homodyne measurements on the field leaving the cavity on the opposite side .",
    "the purpose of the cavity is to reflect the probe light several times before it is detected whereby the effective interaction strength between the light field and the system is increased as we shall demonstrate below .",
    "probing of atomic systems by their effect on the transmission properties of an optical cavity have a long history in quantum optics .",
    "early studies focused on the field - atom dynamics , leading , for instance , to the normal - mode splitting of the transmission resonance @xcite and on photon statistics @xcite , while more recent work has shown the possibility to observe the spatial motion of individual atoms trapped inside the cavity by the probing beam itself @xcite .",
    "see also the work on optically transported or guided atoms @xcite .",
    "more recently , optical cavities have been introduced in experiments to probe bose - einstein condensates @xcite .    a stochastic master equation for a setup involving a cavity and",
    "a homodyne detector has been derived using a rather different approach in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that paper , however , the aim was not to use an auxiliary system to perform indirect measurements but to determine the time evolution of the field in a cavity , when the light leaking out of the cavity is subjected to measurements , and thus the probing light and the probed system , which are crucial ingredients in the present paper , were not included in the analysis .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we describe the physical setup under consideration and discuss the time evolution of the density matrix .",
    "if the dynamics is slow compared to the round trip time of light in the cavity , we can use a continuous description and derive the stochastic master equation in sec.[iii ] . in sec .",
    "[ iv ] we comment further on the derived equation , and in sec .",
    "[ v ] we apply it to specific systems to illustrate explicitly how the state of the system is gradually collapsed by the measurements and to investigate how the relative strength of the probing and the coherent dynamics of the system influences the time evolution .",
    "[ vi ] concludes the paper .",
    "the probing procedure applied is shown schematically in fig.[setup ] .",
    "the system is placed inside a four sided ring cavity .",
    "the probe light enters the cavity from the left , it interacts with the system , and eventually it leaks out of the cavity , where the transmitted light is subjected to a balanced homodyne measurement . in order to describe the quantum state of the light field",
    "we divide all the light beams into small segments of duration @xmath0 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lightmodes ] and treat each segment as a single mode .",
    "this is valid provided @xmath0 is chosen sufficiently small .",
    "the state of the light and the system is then specified as the collective state of all the light modes and the system . to avoid keeping track of an enormous number of modes , we assume that the probe light is in a coherent state before it enters into the cavity",
    ". the modes of the probe beam that have not yet reached the cavity are then in a product state , and their time evolution is independent of the dynamics inside the cavity and the outcome of the homodyne measurements .",
    "these modes can consequently be excluded from the analysis until the time , when they arrive at the cavity .",
    "the vacuum field incident on the beam splitter bs@xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ setup ] and the coherent state local oscillator field are also product states , and again it is sufficient to consider the modes that are currently entering .",
    "the modes that are detected in the homodyne detector are traced out after the measurements , and the unobserved modes that leave the cavity at bs@xmath2 are also traced out in each time step .",
    "the number of active modes is then constant in time , and in the following we denote the density operator of the light modes inside the cavity , the light modes between the cavity and the detectors , and the system at time @xmath3 by @xmath4 .",
    "we note that the analysis can also be carried out for a squeezed input field by including an optical parametric oscillator in front of the cavity in fig.[setup ] . for a suitable theoretical description of the optical parametric oscillator see ref .",
    "@xcite .     and m@xmath1 and the two beam splitters bs@xmath2 and bs@xmath1 .",
    "the probe light @xmath5 enters the cavity through bs@xmath2 .",
    "the cavity field interacts with the system and leaks out of the cavity through bs@xmath2 and bs@xmath1 ( @xmath6 is a vacuum state ) .",
    "the light transmitted through the cavity is subjected to balanced homodyne detection .",
    "bs@xmath7 is a 50:50 beam splitter , @xmath8 is a strong local oscillator , and the two detectors register @xmath9 and @xmath10 photons , respectively .",
    "the measurement readout is @xmath11 . ]    . ]    to determine the time evolution of @xmath4 we express @xmath12 in terms of @xmath4 .",
    "the relevant modes are the modes included in @xmath4 and the mode of the probe field , the vacuum state mode , and the local oscillator mode that reach beam splitters bs@xmath2 , bs@xmath1 , and bs@xmath7 , respectively , in the time interval between @xmath3 and @xmath13 , and the state of these modes is @xmath14 . in the time between @xmath3 and @xmath13 several interactions",
    "take place .",
    "the state of the two modes that hit the beam splitter bs@xmath2 are mixed , and this process is described by the unitary operator @xmath15 .",
    "similar transformations , described by the operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 , occur at beam splitters bs@xmath1 and bs@xmath7 .",
    "the system itself undergoes evolution during @xmath0 and the light mode that passes the system at time @xmath3 interacts with it .",
    "the corresponding infinitesimal time evolution operator is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the sum of the system hamiltonian @xmath20 and the hamiltonian @xmath21 for the interaction between the system and the light field .",
    "we note that the system could be subjected to manipulations that depend on the state of the system and light field and such feedback terms would be included in @xmath20 . in the following we disregard decay of the system , since it does not add any interesting points to the analysis , and",
    "it is easily included by adding a term to the final equation ( see for instance @xcite for a derivation of the relevant term for a system consisting of a single two - level atom ) .",
    "if the system is an extended object that interacts strongly and , for example , depletes the light field , it would be relevant to slice the system into small pieces and consider interactions between the system and several light modes in each time step , but we ignore such complications here .",
    "we shall also assume that the mirrors m@xmath2 and m@xmath1 induce phase shifts of @xmath22 , which are taken into account through the operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "finally , the two modes that hit the detectors in the time interval @xmath0 are projected on photon number states @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . even though the detectors are able to resolve the exact number of photons microscopically , the only macroscopically available measurement readout is the difference @xmath11 between the number of detected photons in the two detectors .",
    "we thus have to average over all possible values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 that lead to the observed value of @xmath27 .",
    "putting all the transformations together , we obtain the density operator at time @xmath13 conditioned on the measurement of a difference of @xmath27 photons in the interval from @xmath3 to @xmath13 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the probability , determined from the normalization of @xmath12 , to obtain the measurement outcome @xmath27 , and tr@xmath2 denotes the trace over the unobserved mode leaving the cavity at beam splitter bs@xmath2 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath4 is completely specified by eq .",
    ", and in principle one can start with a given initial state and iterate on a computer .",
    "this task does , however , soon become unwieldy due to the large number of modes that are involved . in the next section",
    "we show how eq .",
    "can be simplified considerably and rewritten as a stochastic differential equation by invoking a few assumptions .",
    "the key assumption in the following derivation is that all changes of the state of the light field takes place on a time scale that is large compared to the round trip time @xmath30 of light in the cavity , which is valid if the cavity is sufficiently small . in this case",
    "the temporal width of the light modes can be chosen as large as @xmath30 , and , in particular , the field inside the cavity can be treated as a single mode .",
    "the assumption requires that the coupling between the system and the light field is not too large , since , for instance , the fraction of the light absorbed or emitted during a single round trip must be small .",
    "the finesse of the cavity must also be high and the total number of photons in a segment of duration @xmath30 of the input beam must be small in order to avoid that a significant number of photons leak out of or enter into the cavity within a time @xmath30 . finally , variations in , for instance , the input field or the interactions between the system and the light field that take place on a time scale small compared to @xmath30 are not allowed , since they will be smeared out .",
    "actually , the input field typically has such fast variations because the size of the cavity is large compared to the wavelength of the input light , but , provided the frequency of the radiation is not too far from a cavity resonance , this problem is easily circumvented by moving into a frame rotating with the relevant resonance frequency of the cavity , and in the following all frequencies are to be measured relative to the cavity resonance . with these requirements",
    "we can treat @xmath30 as an infinitesimal quantity , and below we shall denote @xmath30 by @xmath0 . for simplicity , we shall also assume that the homodyne detector is placed within a distance @xmath31 from bs@xmath1 , where @xmath32 is the speed of light , since in that case @xmath4 includes only the state of the system and a single mode of the light field ( the cavity mode ) .",
    "when @xmath30 is infinitesimal , the transmission @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) of beam splitter bs@xmath2 ( bs@xmath1 ) must also be infinitesimal , and we define @xmath35 by @xmath36 this allows us to rewrite the unitary operator @xmath37 representing bs@xmath2 , as @xmath38 to first order in @xmath0 , where @xmath39 is the reflectivity of bs@xmath2 , @xmath40 is the field annihilation operator of the cavity field , and @xmath41 is the field annihilation operator of the mode of width @xmath0 of the input field that arrives at the beam splitter at time @xmath3 .",
    "note that has been chosen such that after the interaction , the @xmath40-mode is still the cavity mode , while the @xmath41-mode is the mode leaving the cavity .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the field annihilation operator of the mode leaving the cavity at bs@xmath1 .",
    "the operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 both act on the cavity mode and thus @xmath44 since the number of photons in a segment of duration @xmath30 of the input beam is assumed to be much smaller than one , we can write @xmath45 to first order in @xmath0 , where @xmath46 is of order unity , @xmath47 is of order @xmath48 , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are of order @xmath0 .    putting the relation @xmath18 and eqs .  , , , and into eq . , we find @xmath51dt+u_{00}t_1\\\\ \\left([\\hat{a}^\\dag,\\rho(t)]\\mathrm{tr}\\left(\\hat{b}\\rho_{in}(t)\\right ) -[\\hat{a},\\rho(t)]\\mathrm{tr}\\left(\\rho_{in}(t)\\hat{b}^\\dag\\right)\\right)\\\\ + u_{10}t_2\\hat{a}\\rho(t)+u_{01}t_2\\rho(t)\\hat{a}^\\dag\\\\ + \\frac{1}{2}u_{00}t_1 ^ 2\\left(-\\hat{a}^\\dag\\hat{a}\\rho(t ) -\\rho(t)\\hat{a}^\\dag\\hat{a}+2\\hat{a}\\rho(t)\\hat{a}^\\dag\\right)\\\\ + \\frac{1}{2}t_2 ^ 2\\big(-u_{00}\\hat{a}^\\dag\\hat{a}\\rho(t ) -u_{00}\\rho(t)\\hat{a}^\\dag\\hat{a } + 2u_{11}\\hat{a}\\rho(t)\\hat{a}^\\dag\\\\ + \\sqrt{2}u_{20}\\hat{a}^2\\rho(t ) + \\sqrt{2}u_{02}\\rho(t)(\\hat{a}^\\dag)^2\\big)\\bigg),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are photon number states . for a strong local oscillator ( @xmath55 ) we can apply the approximation @xmath56 and turn the sum in eq .   into an integral , which leads to ( @xmath57 ) @xmath58 from the normalization of eq .",

    "we note that this shift is insignificant if the changes of the state of the system induced by the homodyne measurements take place on a time scale that is much longer than @xmath165 , which is often the case , because the coupling strength @xmath141 of the off - resonant interaction between the system and the cavity mode is typically very small .",
    "we next consider in more detail how the measurement of the phase shift of the transmitted light can be used to prepare different types of quantum mechanical states .      to prepare a dicke state we choose @xmath166 ( corresponding to a measurement of the @xmath167-quadrature of the field ) , since it follows from eq .   and the definition of @xmath168 that those measurements are most sensitive to the induced phase changes in the limit @xmath169 and @xmath170 . in this case @xmath171 with @xmath172 and , from eq .",

    "the plots of @xmath147 illustrate how the state of the system is gradually collapsed onto an eigenstate of the operator @xmath139 , and it is clear that each peak in @xmath175 corresponds to a specific value of @xmath9 if @xmath184 is large .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      it is also possible to use the setup to generate a superposition of two dicke states as , for instance , the maximally entangled state @xmath185 . to do so we include an additional phase shift inside the cavity such that the hamiltonian reads @xmath186 with this hamiltonian the states @xmath25 and @xmath187 are indistinguishable if the @xmath188-quadrature of the field is measured ( @xmath189 in eq .  ) , and thus , for the initial state @xmath190 , a superposition of @xmath6 and @xmath191 is generated after sufficiently long measurement time with probability @xmath192 . to achieve a pure atomic state , it is required to work under lossless conditions , i.e. , under conditions where eq .",
    "is valid , and it is also important to avoid entanglement between the cavity field and the atoms at the final time , since the cavity field is to be traced out to obtain the atomic state . the last requirement is easily fulfilled by turning off the probe field at some point , letting the cavity field decay to the vacuum state while keeping the detector turned on .",
    "we note that the protocol is more demanding than the protocol to generate dicke states due to the requirement of lossless conditions and because the difference between @xmath168 and @xmath193 is second order in @xmath194 , which leads to an increase in the required measurement time .       as a function of scaled time @xmath195 for @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath166 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and initial state @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the vacuum state of the cavity mode .",
    "for weak driving with @xmath205 ( red curve ) the continuous measurements inhibit the coherent evolution between the states @xmath6 and @xmath206 , while for strong driving with @xmath207 ( green curve ) the time evolution of the state almost follows the deterministic evolution obtained for @xmath208 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the blue curve ( @xmath209 ) illustrates the behavior of the state of the system in the intermediate regime .",
    "the same noise realization is used to compute all curves . ]    in the preceding subsections the state of the atoms was simply detected by an indirect continuous measurement , but we now add the complication of internal dynamics by allowing transitions between adjacent @xmath25 states . specifically , we consider the hamiltonian @xmath210 where @xmath211 and @xmath212 , and @xmath213 refers to atom number @xmath213 , which , depending on the level structure of the atoms , may be realized by applying a microwave field propagating in a direction perpendicular to the cavity axis . since @xmath214 and @xmath215 we obtain the stochastic master equation for the system and the cavity field by adding the terms @xmath216 to the right hand side of the master equation for the hamiltonian in eq .  .",
    "( @xmath217 ) . ]    the added system hamiltonian drives a coherent evolution between the different @xmath25 states of the system , but if the measurements are sufficiently strong , the continuous back action of the measurements on the state of the system blocks the coherent evolution . to demonstrate this effect , which is known as the quantum zeno effect",
    ", we use the milstein scheme ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) to solve the _ nonlinear _ stochastic master equation numerically for a particular realization of the measurement outcomes .",
    "the accuracy of the integration may be checked for @xmath218 by application of the analytical results obtained in the previous subsection .",
    "we use the fock state basis for the cavity mode and neglect terms in the density operator with more than @xmath219 photons in the cavity , where @xmath220 ( see sec.[va ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "since @xmath221 is not exactly zero , there is a small probability that the system switches to state @xmath206 , where it is subsequently stabilized , and if the dynamics is integrated for sufficiently long time , several such quantum jumps between @xmath6 and @xmath206 will occur ( fig.[qjump ] ) .",
    "we note that for general @xmath109 the states with @xmath222 or @xmath223 are easier to stabilize by measurements , since the square root factors in eqs .",
    ", , , and are smaller for @xmath9 close to @xmath121 or @xmath109 than they are for @xmath9 close to @xmath224 .",
    "finally , as a simple example of feedback , we note that it is possible to generate a particular eigenstate of @xmath139 by increasing @xmath225 whenever @xmath147 becomes small and decreasing @xmath225 to zero whenever @xmath163 becomes large .",
    "in conclusion we have considered the influence of a specific indirect continuous measurement on the state of an abstract system , and we have derived the master equation determining the time evolution of the state of the system conditioned on the measurement outcomes . this equation provides a tool to analyze a wide variety of systems and phenomena in detail , and we have applied it to demonstrate the collapse of the state of a system onto an eigenstate of the measurement operator and to demonstrate quantum jumps and blocking of the internal dynamics of a system due to continuous measurements .",
    "indirect measurements are important because they constitute a special class of state manipulations that are very useful to prepare systems in specific quantum mechanical states .",
    "the crucial point is that the complete collapse of the state due to back action of a measurement performed directly on the system is avoided by performing instead the measurement on an auxiliary system that has interacted with the system .",
    "we showed examples with simple atomic level structures , but we emphasize that our analysis applies to quite general quantum systems and , for example , to multi - level atoms with shelving states leading to macroscopic quantum jumps in the transmitted intensity @xcite .",
    "a further step towards achieving control on the quantum state of a system is to apply feedback @xcite by subjecting the system to disturbances that depend on the outcome of measurements .",
    "this situation may also be handled by the formalism developed in the present paper .",
    "the derived stochastic master equation is thus a valuable tool to investigate further state preparation protocols .",
