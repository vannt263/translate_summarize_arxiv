    "obviously , every circulant matrix can be generated given any row of the matrix  conventionally we use the first row of the matrix , denoted as @xmath70 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath67 has at most @xmath7 distinct eigenvalues which are given by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73  @xcite . if @xmath67 is singular , some of the eigenvalues of @xmath67 are zeros .",
    "the complete graph and complete bipartite graph are straightforward examples of circulant graphs with few distinct eigenvalues .",
    "there are also some other interesting examples of circulant graph such as self - complementary circulant graphs and paley graphs with prime order  @xcite",
    ". both of these two families of graphs are also strongly regular graphs which have only three distinct eigenvalues .",
    "for example , the paley graph on 13 vertices has three distinct eigenvalues : 6 ( with multiplicity 1 ) and @xmath74 ( both with multiplicity 6 ) , and thus the diagonal unitary @xmath75 can be implemented efficiently .",
    "we note here it is required to implement qft ( and its inverse ) for the dimension of 13 , which does not have the form of @xmath27 .",
    "the qft on general dimensions can be implemented by means of amplitude amplification with extra qubit registers to perform the computation  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , approximate versions of the qft on general dimensions have also been developed  @xcite .",
    "we say that the eigenvalues of a circulant graph can be characterised efficiently , if they can be calculated efficiently classically . in other words , the eigenvalue matrix @xmath76 of the given circulant hamiltonian can be efficiently computed , and thus the diagonal unitary operator @xmath75 can be efficiently implemented  @xcite . specifically , there exists a quantum circuit shown in figure  [ diagonalunitarycircuit ] , which transforms a computational basis state @xmath77 , together with a @xmath16-qubit ancilla @xmath78 for @xmath79 , as @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "note that here we assume @xmath82 can be expressed exactly as a rational number with @xmath16 bits of precision .",
    "if this is not the case , truncating @xmath82 to @xmath16 bits of precision will introduce an error which can be made arbitrarily small by taking large enough @xmath79 . the function",
    "@xmath83 returns @xmath84 for any given @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath84 is always a real number since the adjacency matrix is symmetric .",
    "for example , for the case of the cycle graph of @xmath27 vertices , there are essentially @xmath86 distinct eigenvalues simply given by @xmath87 , where @xmath81",
    ". and then @xmath83 will be the cosine function that can be computed with a number of operations polynomial in @xmath4 , using a reversible equivalent of classical algorithms to compute trigonometric functions , e.g. the taylor approximation .",
    "in general , given a sparse circulant graph which has only @xmath37 @xmath88s in the first row @xmath70 of its adjacency matrix , an efficient function @xmath83 can be given as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the set of positions for which the first row in nonzero .",
    "@xmath83 is a sum of @xmath91 numbers , taking @xmath33 time to compute . for a non - sparse circulant graph ,",
    "its eigenvalues are still possible to be calculated efficiently classically .",
    "some straightforward examples are complete graph , complete bipartite graph @xmath92 and cocktail party graph .",
    "therefore , together with the quantum circuits of qft and the inverse of qft , we construct an efficient quantum circuit for implementing ctqw on the circulant graph whose eigenvalues can be computed efficiently classically .",
    "unlike the sampling problem we discussed in the main text , the scenario of `` swap test '' , where we compare two unitary processes @xmath36 and @xmath93 , could sometimes be easier for a classical computer .",
    "imagine we start each process in the state @xmath94 .",
    "then the overlap @xmath95 between the resulting output states approximated by the swap test satisfies @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the value at position @xmath85 on the diagonal of @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath95 can be approximated by a classical algorithm up to @xmath48 additive error .",
    "the algorithm simply takes the average of @xmath37 values of the product @xmath98 for uniformly random @xmath85 . for each @xmath85",
    ", this value can be computed exactly in polynomial time .",
    "this highlights that the complexity of comparing @xmath99 and @xmath100 depends on the choice of input states @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in full generality",
    ", one could allow these to be arbitrary states produced by a polynomial - time quantum computation ; the state comparison problem would then be bqp - complete , but for rather trivial reasons .",
    "we expect that the problem would remain classically hard for choices of initial states relevant , for example , to quantum - chemistry applications . on the other hand ,",
    "the swap test can still be used as in scenario ( b ) in the main text to compare the evolution of two hamiltonians , one of which is not circulant but is efficiently implementable . in this case , the comparison problem is also bqp - complete , and hence expected to be hard for a classical computer .",

    "<S> these quantum circuits provide the time - evolution states of ctqws on circulant graphs exponentially faster than best previously known methods  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> efficient quantum circuit implementations of ctqws have been presented for sparse and efficiently row - computable graphs  @xcite , and specific non - sparse graphs  @xcite . however , the design of quantum circuits for implementing ctqws is in general difficult , since the time - evolution operator is time - dependent and non - local  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite to show that if there did exist a classical sampler for a somewhat more general class of circuits , this would have the following unlikely complexity - theoretic implication : the infinite tower of complexity classes known as the polynomial hierarchy would collapse . </S>",
    "<S> this evidence of hardness exists despite the classical efficiency with which properties of the ctqw , such as the eigenvalues of circulant graphs , can be computed on a classical machine .    for an undirected graph @xmath6 of @xmath7 vertices , </S>",

    "<S> @xmath30 can be implemented using at most @xmath7 controlled - phase gates with phase values being a linear function of @xmath31 , because an arbitrary phase can be applied to an arbitrary basis state , conditional on at most @xmath32 qubits . </S>",

    "<S> a general construction of efficient quantum circuits for @xmath30 was given by childs  @xcite , and is shown in the appendix for completeness . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the quantum circuit implementations of ctqws on circulant graphs can be constructed , which have an overall complexity of @xmath33 , and act on at most @xmath29 qubits . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the best known classical algorithm based on fast fourier transform , that has the computational complexity of @xmath35  @xcite , the proposed quantum circuit implementation generates the evolution state @xmath1 with an exponential advantage in speed .    consider a circuit of the form @xmath36 , where @xmath30 is a diagonal matrix made up of @xmath37 controlled - phase gates . </S>",

    "<S> this class of circuits is known as instantaneous quantum polynomial time ( iqp )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that computing @xmath40 for arbitrary diagonal unitaries @xmath30 made up of circuits of @xmath37 gates , even if each acts on @xmath41 qubits , is # p - hard  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this hardness result even holds for approximating @xmath40 up to any multiplicative error strictly less than @xmath42  @xcite , where @xmath43 is said to approximate @xmath40 up to multiplicative error @xmath44 if @xmath45    towards a contradiction , assume that there exists a polynomial - time randomized classical algorithm which samples from @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> then a classic result of stockmeyer  @xcite states that there is an algorithm in the complexity class fbpp@xmath47 which can approximate any desired probability @xmath5 to within multiplicative error @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this complexity class fbpp@xmath47described as polynomial - time randomized classical computation equipped with an oracle to solve arbitrary np problems  sits within the infinite tower of complexity classes known as the polynomial(-time ) hierarchy  @xcite . combining with the above hardness result of approximating @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the assumption implies that an fbpp@xmath49 algorithm solves a # p - hard problem , so p@xmath50 would be contained within fbpp@xmath49 , and therefore the polynomial hierarchy would collapse to its third level . </S>",
    "<S> this consequence is considered very unlikely in computational complexity theory  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that a polynomial - time randomized classical sampler from the distribution @xmath46 is unlikely to exist . </S>",
    "<S> further , this even holds for classical algorithms which sample from any distribution @xmath51 which approximates @xmath46 up to multiplicative error strictly less than @xmath42 in each probability @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that if the output distribution results from measurements on only @xmath52 qubits  @xcite , or obeys the sparsity promise that only a @xmath37-sized , and a priori unknown , subset of the measurement probabilities are nonzero  @xcite , it could be classically efficiently sampled . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of hardness here does not hold for the approximate sampling from @xmath46 up to small _ additive _ error . </S>",
    "<S> it is an interesting open question whether similar techniques to  @xcite can be used to prove hardness of the approximate case , perhaps conditioned on other conjectures in complexity theory .    as an experimental demonstration </S>",
    "<S> , we used a photonic quantum logic to simulate ctqws on the @xmath53 graph  a complete graph with self loops on four vertices ( figure  [ expsetup](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> complete graphs are a special kind of circulant graph , with an adjacency matrix @xmath13 where @xmath54 for all @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of a complete graph on @xmath7 vertices has only 2 distinct eigenvalues , 0 and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of @xmath53 is @xmath57 . following the aforementioned discussion </S>",
    "<S> , we can readily construct the quantum circuit for implementing ctqws on @xmath53 graph based on diagonalization using the qft matrix . </S>",
    "<S> however , the choice of using the qft matrix as the eigenbasis of hamiltonian is not strictly necessary  any equivalent eigenbasis can be selected . through the diagonalization </S>",
    "<S> using hadamard eigenbasis , an alternative efficient quantum circuit for implementing ctqws on @xmath53 graph is shown in figure  [ expsetup](b ) , which can be easily extended to the complete graph on @xmath7 vertices .    </S>",
    "<S> we built a configurable two - qubit photonics quantum processor ( figure  [ expsetup](c ) ) , adapting the entanglement - based technique presented in  @xcite , and implemented ctqws on @xmath53 graph with various evolving times and initial states . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we prepared two different initial states @xmath58'$ ] and @xmath59'$ ] , which represent the quantum walker starting from vertex 1 , and the superposition of vertices 1 and 2 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we chose the evolution time following the list @xmath60 , which covers the whole periodical characteristics of ctqws on @xmath53 graph . </S>",
    "<S> for each evolution , we sampled the corresponding probability distribution with fixed integration time , shown in figure  [ expdata](a ) and ( b ) . to measure how close the experimental and ideal probability distributions are , we calculated the average fidelities defined as @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the achieved average fidelities for the samplings with two distinct initial states are 96.68@xmath620.27% and 95.82@xmath620.25% respectively . </S>",
    "<S> through the proposed circuit implementation , we are also able to examine the evolution states using quantum state tomography , which is generally difficult for the analog simulations . for two specific evolution states @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we performed quantum state tomography and reconstructed the density matrices using the maximum likelihood estimation technique . </S>",
    "<S> the two reconstructed density matrices achieve fidelities of 85.81@xmath621.08% and 88.44@xmath620.97% respectively , shown in figure  [ expdata](c ) and ( d ) .    in this paper , we have described how ctqws on circulant graphs can be efficiently implemented on a quantum computer , if the eigenvalues of the graphs can be characterised efficiently classically . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we can construct an efficient quantum circuit to implement ctqws on any graph whose adjacency matrix is efficiently diagonalisable , in other words , as long as the matrix of column eigenvectors @xmath23 and the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalue exponentials @xmath30 can be implemented efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the problem of sampling from the output probability distributions of quantum circuits of the form @xmath65 is hard for classical computers , based on a highly plausible conjecture that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is particularly interesting from both perspectives of ctqw and computational complexity theory , as it provides new insights into the ctqw framework and also helps to classify and identify new problems in computational complexity theory . for the ctqws on the circulant graphs of @xmath66 non - zero eigenvalues , </S>",
    "<S> the proposed quantum circuit implementations do not need a fully universal quantum computer , and thus can be viewed as an intermediate model of quantum computation . although the hardness of the approximate case of the sampling problem is unknown , the evidence we provided for the exact case indicates a promising candidate for experimentally establishing quantum supremacy over classical computers , and further evidence against the extended church - turing thesis . </S>",
    "<S> compared with other intermediate models such as the one clean qubit model  @xcite , iqp and boson sampling  @xcite , the quantum circuit implementation of ctqws is also more appealing due to available methods in fault tolerance and error correction , which are difficult to implement for other models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may also lead onto other practical applications through the use of ctqws for quantum algorithm design .    </S>",
