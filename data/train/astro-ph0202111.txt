    "the tight correlation between luminosity and rotation velocity for spiral galaxies , a.k.a .  the tully - fisher relation ( tfr , * ? ? ? * ) , has motivated dozens of studies over the years . in pursuit of the best possible distance indicator ,",
    "most tf analyses have been carried out in red or infrared passbands ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which offer lower scatter than bluer passbands .",
    "however , recent theoretical work has emphasized the value of studying tf scatter for its own sake , as this scatter holds fundamental clues to the formation and evolution of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations in bluer passbands are extremely useful for understanding tf scatter , because the scatter arising from recent star formation , differences in stellar populations , and the spread in formation redshifts is most visible in the blue .",
    "physical scatter in the tfr can come from three sources : ( 1 ) variations in the stellar mass - to - light ratio , ( 2 ) variations in the stellar mass fraction ( stellar - to - total mass ratio ) , and ( 3 ) differences in how the observed velocity width relates to the total mass . by identifying physical scatter from any one of these sources we limit the contributions of the other two , simultaneously gaining insight into the star formation histories of galaxies , the relationship between visible galaxies and dark matter halos , and the dynamics and structure of galaxy disks .",
    "a better understanding of the sources of tf scatter may also minimize uncertainties in other types of tf analyses .",
    "for example , if tf slope varies with environment , or if galaxies with different colors define different tf zero points , then a cluster tfr calibrated with a small set of galaxies that have cepheid distances may not be universal ( e.g.  as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "correcting for these systematics could reduce scatter and improve the tfr as a distance indicator .",
    "calibrating zero point shifts as a function of color and emission line strength could also aid in the interpretation of evidence for luminosity evolution in the intermediate - redshift tfr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also kannappan , fabricant , & franx , in preparation ) .    here , we use a well - defined sample of emission - line galaxies drawn from the 196-galaxy nearby field galaxy survey ( nfgs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to examine how offsets from the u , b , and r - band tfrs depend upon the physical properties of galaxies . while previous tf studies have often included hundreds or thousands of galaxies ( e.g. *",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , none of these data sets has both the broadly representative sample demographics and the wide array of supporting data of the nfgs (  [ sc : nfgstf1 ] ) .",
    "thus despite its modest size , the present survey offers unique advantages for studying scatter in the tfr .",
    "the bulk of this paper analyzes a sample of nfgs galaxies consisting of @xmath670 sa  sd spiral galaxies brighter than m@xmath5 .",
    "this spiral sample allows us to investigate the behavior of galaxies often excluded from the tfr : sa galaxies and galaxies with peculiarities such as warps , multiple nuclei , or interacting companions .",
    "ultimately , we seek to fit these galaxies into a unified picture , in which we understand tf residuals in terms of continuous physical properties . to this end",
    "we undertake a detailed analysis of third - parameter correlations with tf residuals , and we attempt to form a physical understanding of tf scatter .",
    "the remainder of the paper draws from the full nfgs to define an extended sample of @xmath6110 galaxies including very late types , emission - line e / s0 galaxies , and faint dwarfs .",
    "the extended sample allows us to search for physical drivers of tf scatter in a heterogeneous population .",
    "the only other comparable tf sample is the @xmath640-galaxy ursa major sample of @xcite , which was drawn from a restricted environment .",
    "the virgo and fornax cluster samples of @xcite and @xcite apply morphology restrictions that exclude irregular or interacting galaxies .",
    "although some intermediate - redshift tf analyses have included a wide range of morphologies @xcite , these studies nonetheless favor a select population : typically , moderately bright blue galaxies with strong emission and high surface brightness . and",
    "although the samples studied by @xcite and @xcite both span large ranges in luminosity , the former study is restricted by hubble type and evidence for interaction , while the latter study is drawn from a heterogeneous mix of smaller samples selected by various criteria in different photometric bands .",
    "the nfgs thus provides an unusually broad and unbiased representation of the general galaxy population .    in what follows",
    ", we describe the survey and briefly review our data reduction and analysis techniques (  [ sc : nfgstf1][sc : ldata ] ) , then present results for the spiral sample (  [ sc : spiralcal][sc : spiral3 ] ) and for the extended sample (  [ sc : fulltfr ] ) .",
    "we summarize our major conclusions in  [ sc : concltf1 ] .",
    "further details on our data analysis methods may be found in appendices  [ sc : fitting][sc : asymmeast ] .",
    "the comprehensive nature of the nearby field galaxy survey ( nfgs ) enables us to analyze how tf scatter depends on a broad range of galaxy properties .",
    "the database includes ubr photometry , integrated and nuclear spectrophotometry , and gas and stellar kinematic data for a statistically representative sample of the local galaxy population ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* kannappan et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the 196 nfgs galaxies were objectively selected from the cfa  1 redshift survey @xcite without preference for morphology , color , diameter , inclination , environment , or any other galaxy property , as described in @xcite . to counteract the bright galaxy bias of cfa  1",
    ", galaxies were included approximately in proportion to the local b - band galaxy luminosity function ( lf , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the final sample spanning luminosities from m@xmath7 @xmath6@xmath823 to @xmath815 .",
    "the resulting sample provides an unusually unbiased sampling of the general galaxy population . however , no sample is completely free of selection effects .",
    "the nfgs is subject to the inherent color and surface brightness biases of the parent cfa  1 survey , itself a descendent of the zwicky catalog and therefore essentially b - selected . also , despite the attempt to favor faint galaxies in the selection process",
    ", the nfgs reproduces the local lf imperfectly .",
    "figure  [ fg : lf ] shows that the sample luminosity distribution varies slowly over the range @xmath9 and cuts off for brighter and fainter galaxies .",
    "another potential concern is the luminosity - distance correlation built into the nfgs .",
    "the survey was selected with a luminosity - dependent lower redshift limit instead of a maximum diameter limit , in order to increase the odds that galaxies would fit within the length of the 3@xmath10 spectrograph slit without biasing the sample in diameter @xcite . as a result ,",
    "fainter galaxies have greater fractional uncertainties in distances and absolute magnitudes , and such galaxies receive less weight in error - weighted tf fits .",
    "for this reason , we adopt unweighted fits as our primary fitting technique ( see appendix  [ sc : fitting ] for a discussion of the differences between techniques ) .",
    "our primary velocity widths are derived from the full set of 153 major - axis ionized gas rotation curves ( rcs ) obtained for the nfgs kinematic database ( kannappan et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this sample is complete in the sense that kinematic observations were attempted for all nfgs galaxies ; however , emission line detection limits varied with observing conditions , integration times , and available emission lines ( see  [ sc : orcobs ] ) . figure  [ fg : emhists ] displays the emission line properties of the optical rc sample in the context of the nfgs as a whole .    as illustrated in figure  [ fg : typemagdistrib ] , the optical rc sample includes all nfgs galaxies of type sab and later ( including type `` pec '' galaxies ) , except for two galaxies that show largely featureless spectra .",
    "in addition , the sample includes 12 of the 13 sa s in the nfgs and 17 of the e / s0 s .    for comparison with the optical data ,",
    "we have also extracted hi 21-cm linewidths for 105 nfgs galaxies from the catalogs of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these galaxies are not a statistically fair subsample of the nfgs : hi data are more often missing for the higher luminosity nfgs galaxies .",
    "we exclude from analysis one galaxy that has hi data but no optical rc ( ngc  2692 , an sa galaxy ) .",
    "the nfgs includes galaxies at all inclinations @xmath11 , but @xmath12 corrections are uncertain for galaxies with @xmath13 , so most of our analysis considers only the 108 nfgs emission - line galaxies with @xmath14 .",
    "however , we do not restrict inclinations when calibrating optical - to - radio conversions (  [ sc : vcalcs ] ) , because no inclination correction is required .",
    "long slit spectra were obtained during several observing runs between 1996 and 1999 , using the fast spectrograph on the tillinghast telescope @xcite . for most galaxies we observed the h@xmath4 , [ nii ] , and [ sii ] lines between @xmath662007200  , with spectral resolution @xmath15 30 @xmath16 , a 2@xmath17 or occasionally 3@xmath17 wide slit , and a spatial binning of 2.3@xmath17/pixel ( comparable to the typical seeing of 2@xmath17 ) . for some galaxies , in conjunction with stellar absorption line observations",

    "all galaxies with large or uncertain @xmath20p.a .",

    "vdefns ] , where we do not employ an inclination restriction , we explicitly exclude galaxies with large or uncertain @xmath20p.a .",
    "all of the data were reduced using standard methods , including bias and dark subtraction , flat - fielding , wavelength calibration , heliocentric velocity correction , sky subtraction , spectral straightening , and cosmic ray removal , using iraf and idl .",
    "we extracted rotation curves by fitting all available emission lines simultaneously with fixed line spacing in @xmath23 , rejecting fits with s / n @xmath24 3 . in cases of severe h@xmath4 or h@xmath18 absorption , these lines were omitted from the fits .",
    "we have considered three possible optical velocity measures : @xmath25 , the single largest velocity in the rotation curve ; @xmath26 , the velocity interpolated at the `` critical radius '' ( 1.3@xmath27 , the peak velocity position for a theoretical exponential disk , * ? ? ?",

    "the most robust velocity width estimator is @xmath28 , which makes use of all of the data without imposing a specific model on the rc .    except when comparing our data with other optical rc tf samples ,",
    "we convert all of our optical and radio velocity widths to an equivalent w@xmath29 linewidth scale ( where w@xmath30 is the hi linewidth at @xmath31% of peak intensity , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for galaxies with w@xmath32 but no w@xmath29 in the catalog ,",
    "we simply subtract 20 @xmath33 from the w@xmath32 linewidths and use the adjusted w@xmath32 s together with the w@xmath29 s , referring to the combined data set as w@xmath34 .",
    "the number 20 @xmath35 comes from a comparison of w@xmath32 and w@xmath29 where we have both measures ; @xcite derive a similar value from a much larger sample .",
    "appendix  [ sc : vdefns ] presents the empirically fitted relations we use to convert raw optical @xmath36 s to w@xmath29-equivalent w@xmath37 s , as determined from the 96 galaxies for which we have both optical rc and w@xmath29 data .",
    "we use the scatter in the conversion relations to set the nominal error bars for the final velocity widths .",
    "these error bars include not only the optical rc measurement errors ( which are small ) but also all other sources of discrepancy between optical and radio velocity widths , including p.a .",
    "misalignment errors as well as `` physical '' errors due to fundamental differences between the kinematics of unresolved global hi fields and the kinematics of hii regions that happen to lie along arbitrary 1d lines .",
    "_ however , contrary to common assumption , the limited extent of the optical rcs does not lead to any significant discrepancy with the global hi linewidths . _",
    "radio w@xmath29 s and optical velocity widths agree well even for the nfgs galaxies whose rcs are truncated at @xmath211.3@xmath27 ( see appendix  [ sc : vdefns ] ) . except",

    "we have checked the quality of the ugc estimates against estimates derived from both 2mass data and nfgs ccd photometry ( r. jansen , private communication ) : the newer measurements do not improve tf scatter .",
    "we do not apply turbulence corrections to either optical or radio velocity widths , except when calculating extinctions ( see  [ sc : extinct ] ) .",
    "turbulence estimates are uncertain , and furthermore turbulence corrections may be inappropriate for small galaxies and non - equilibrium systems .",
    "in fact turbulence may provide an important source of support for such systems , and we might wish to _ add _ a gas pressure correction to the optical velocity widths .",
    "the conversion of optical velocity widths to an equivalent w@xmath29 scale (  [ sc : vcalcs ] ) effectively makes such a correction , averaged over the sample .",

    "we apply the above extinction corrections to galaxies of type sa and later ; extinction corrections for e / s0 galaxies are set to zero . except for one e galaxy ,",
    "this choice has little impact , since applying the extinction formula to the other e / s0 s would yield corrections of @xmath240.15 mag .",
    "note that we _ do _ apply the correction to dwarf galaxies .",
    "although the @xcite extinction corrections were derived for a sample composed primarily of spiral galaxies , @xcite has shown that they perform well for dwarf galaxies . as prescribed by @xcite ,",
    "the extinction corrections are set to zero whenever they go negative , to avoid having the corrected luminosities come out fainter than the observed luminosities .",
    "for the same reason , the error bars on the corrected magnitudes do not extend fainter than the measurement errors on the observed magnitudes .",
    "@xcite , following @xcite , uses an alternative correction formula with no velocity width or luminosity dependence .",
    "however , if we follow their procedure and choose a luminosity - independent value of @xmath61 to best minimize tf scatter , we find that no value of @xmath61 reduces scatter as well as the @xcite  formulation . in the r band ,",
    "the @xcite  corrections perform only marginally better than the luminosity - independent corrections , but at b and u the differences become more substantial ( at u , scatter decreases by 18% compared to 8% ) .",

    "matched as described in the figure caption , we detect no zero point offset within the errors .",
    "the slope of the vs sample appears considerably shallower , but inspection of the data reveals that the behavior of a few galaxies at the faint end of the tfr accounts entirely for the difference . in ",
    "[ sc : umdwarfs ] we discuss possible reasons for the divergence of the two samples at the faint end .",
    "the sources of measurement error for the ursa major sample are qualitatively different than for the nfgs , so we must compare intrinsic scatter values , formed by subtracting measurement - error scatter from observed scatter in quadrature .",
    "we predict the measurement - error scatter for vs using the same code with which we propagate our own errors , which yields a total predicted r - band scatter of 0.24 mag from four sources : hybrid kinematic - photometric inclination errors ( 0.09 mag ) ; hi linewidth errors ( 0.13 mag ) ; distance uncertainties from cluster depth effects ( 0.17 mag , as estimated by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and errors in photometry and extinction corrections ( 0.06 mag ) .",
    "these numbers are based on the inclination and hi linewidth errors given by vs combined with basic photometry errors of @xmath60.05 mag @xcite . because the nfgs error budget is dominated by inclination errors ,",
    "it is worth mentioning that vs s inclination errors are smaller than ours not so much because they sometimes use kinematic inclinations , as because their photometric inclinations are better than ours .",
    "our inclination errors would probably be comparable to theirs if our galaxies were equally large on the sky : the one - decimal - place precision of the ugc adds greater round - off error for galaxies of smaller angular diameter . to illustrate this",
    ", we have recomputed photometric inclinations for the ursa major sample using ugc axial ratios and the method of  [ sc : vcorrs ] . substituting these inclinations for vs s preferred inclinations",
    "only slightly increases tf scatter .    after subtracting measurement - error scatter in quadrature",
    ", we obtain very similar intrinsic r - band scatter values for the nfgs and the ursa major sample : 0.42 mag and 0.37 mag .",
    "similar agreement is found in the b band . recomputing the nfgs scatter and errors about the shallower slope of the ursa major sample ,",
    "we find even better agreement , but if the nfgs velocity width errors are slightly overestimated (  [ sc : basiccal ] ) then the intrinsic nfgs scatter about the ursa major slope may still be as high as @xmath60.42 mag .",
    "the moderately higher intrinsic scatter of the nfgs compared to ursa major should not be at all surprising , as the nfgs includes a wide range of environments and star formation histories .",
    "apart from the hint of a systematic offset at the faint end mentioned previously , the two samples are in excellent agreement .",
    "other cluster tf studies quote lower scatter than we find for the complete ursa major sample .",
    "for example , combining data from multiple clusters ( including ursa major , fornax , coma , the pisces filament , and several others ) , @xcite measure an r - band scatter of 0.34 mag .",
    "@xcite obtain the same result with a partially overlapping data set and similar analysis techniques .",
    "however , directly comparing the nfgs spiral sample with these multi - cluster samples would be misleading , for several reasons .",
    "first , each individual cluster in the multi - cluster samples obeys a different definition of `` complete '' and satisfies that definition to a different degree .",
    "for example , the `` complete '' fornax sample rejects interacting or disturbed galaxies and multiple systems @xcite .",
    "second , each cluster represents a different environment with a different star formation history , so each cluster s color  magnitude relation may have a different color zero point ( e.g.  tully & pierce find @xmath69 color zero point offsets of @xmath60.1 mag when they compare cluster color  magnitude relations ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "we will see in  [ sc : color ] that if real , such color offsets almost certainly imply tf zero point offsets between the clusters . however , the tf scatter due to these tf zero point offsets is suppressed in the multi - cluster analyses to the extent that the individual cluster tfrs are allowed to shift freely to minimize zero point offsets ( the absolute zero point is generally determined separately using the cepheid calibrator galaxies ) .",
    "a third concern is the effect of a top - heavy luminosity distribution : in combining more distant clusters with more nearby ones , the multi - cluster studies define samples that statistically favor bright galaxies .",
    "this bias may drive down scatter if fainter galaxies have higher scatter . while the existence of such a trend is unclear in our restricted spiral sample ,",
    "dwarf galaxies definitely show higher scatter in the full sample (  [ sc : fulltfr ] ) .",
    "we have shown that our tf results are consistent with previous studies if we reproduce their sample selection criteria .",
    "these criteria often exclude sa galaxies and/or galaxies with morphological peculiarities . here",
    ", we begin the process of analyzing tf scatter for a broad spiral sample by turning the spotlight on sa and peculiar galaxies , highlighting where these galaxies tf residuals fall within the general spiral tfr . for this analysis",
    "we return to the full nfgs spiral tf sample : types sa  sd brighter than m@xmath5 and inclined by @xmath7040@xmath22 .",
    "fourteen of the 68 galaxies in the nfgs spiral tf sample are sa ",
    "sab galaxies , collectively referred to as `` sa '' galaxies from here on .",
    "as a group , these 14 galaxies sit clearly to one side of the tfr ( figure  [ fg : sa ] ) , with offsets toward lower @xmath71/higher @xmath72 of 0.76 mag at r , 0.95 mag at b , and 1.20 mag at u as compared to sb  sd galaxies ( where both sa and sb  sd offsets are computed with respect to the unweighted inverse tf fits in table  1 , with relative offset uncertainties of @xmath60.17 mag ) .",
    "the possibility that sa galaxies rotate faster at a given luminosity was first suggested by @xcite based on 21 cm data .",
    "sa offsets became controversial after @xcite claimed that the sa tfr lies 2 mag below the sc tfr in the b band .",
    "other studies reported smaller offsets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argue that a greater intrinsic spread of luminosities for late - type vs.  early - type galaxies at a given velocity width , combined with malmquist bias , may explain the large offset found by @xcite .",
    "however , sa offsets continue to be observed in increasingly complete samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* see  [ sc : color ] ) .",
    "the scatter properties of our data suggest that the offset we observe is mostly real . in the r band , the sa galaxies and the sb  sd galaxies have biweight tf scatter values of 0.63 mag and 0.70 mag , respectively .",
    "these numbers imply that malmquist bias is unlikely to produce the observed 0.76 mag offset between the two populations . in the b and u bands ,",
    "the scatter in each population increases but the offset increases even more .",
    "the offset exceeds the scatter by 0.3 mag at u.    we have investigated whether the sa offset in our data may be ascribed to systematic errors in luminosity or velocity width measurements .",
    "for example , large bulges could make sa galaxies appear rounder ( and more face on ) than they really are , leading to underestimated extinction corrections and overestimated @xmath40 corrections .",
    "sa s in the present sample do have more face - on inclination estimates on average ( 61@xmath22 vs. 66@xmath22 for the full spiral tf sample ) ; however , this difference can account for an offset of only @xmath60.2 mag at a tf slope of @xmath810 .",
    "furthermore , even extreme assumptions about axial ratios ( e.g.  assigning an intrinsic axial ratio of @xmath73 to sa s and assigning @xmath74 to all other types ) reduce the r - band offset by at most half and have much less effect in the b and u bands .",
    "no other aspect of our analysis is responsible for the offset either .",
    "whether we adopt luminosity - dependent or independent extinction corrections has negligible effect on our results .",
    "we do not add an explicit morphological type dependence to our extinction corrections , but in any case adding such a dependence would probably only increase the sa offset : extinction is likely to be lower in sa galaxies @xcite .",
    "the offset is not appreciably affected when we substitute @xmath26 for @xmath28 or when we omit the optical - to - radio conversion . finally , the available",
    "hi data also seem to confirm the offset ( figure  [ fg : sa ] ) , although these data are subject to incompleteness and high scatter for the sa population .",
    "we conclude that the bulk of the sa offset in our sample is real . however , with just 14 sa galaxies , our analysis is subject to small number statistics .",
    "formally , a kolmogorov - smirnov test yields a probability of @xmath75 that the r - band tf residuals of the sa and sb  sd subpopulations were drawn from the same parent population ( @xmath63.5@xmath76 ) .",
    "a possible physical explanation for the sa offset and a way to remove the offset to reduce scatter will be discussed in  [ sc : color ] .",
    "tf samples are frequently pruned to remove morphologically peculiar galaxies and sometimes also to remove barred galaxies . here",
    "we use the term `` peculiar galaxies '' to mean disturbed spiral galaxies ( i.e.  those with warps , tidal features , multiple nuclei , polar rings , or interacting neighbors ) rather than galaxies that can not be reliably classified as spirals .",
    "figure  [ fg : pecgallery ] shows rotation curves and images for three nfgs galaxies we have identified as morphologically peculiar . to avoid bias , bars and morphological peculiarities",
    "were independently identified by two of us ( s.k . and m.f . )",
    "without reference to tf residuals , and the identifications were further checked against the notes provided by r.a .",
    "jansen in @xcite .",
    "although a number of weak bars and peculiarities were noted , we report here only strong , unambiguous cases identified by more than one observer .",
    "such cases are broadly distributed across a wide range of spiral types and luminosities .",
    "figure  [ fg : mfbprune]a uses two different ( possibly overlapping ) symbols to identify peculiar and barred galaxies within the nfgs tfr .",
    "although the barred galaxies that are _ not _ peculiar do not show a clear systematic offset , the peculiar galaxies as a group tend to lie on the high @xmath71/low @xmath72 side of the tfr .",
    "this pattern suggests that pruning such galaxies may obscure interesting physics hidden in tf scatter .    even when the goal is scatter reduction , pruning may not be the most effective strategy .",
    "figure  [ fg : mfbprune]c demonstrates that pruning barred and peculiar galaxies from the nfgs spiral sample reduces r - band tf scatter to approximately the level expected from measurement errors . in bluer passbands , however , the reduced scatter still exceeds the level expected from measurement errors : we measure 0.63 mag and 0.71 mag in b and u , respectively , compared to a predicted measurement - error scatter of 0.58 mag in both passbands .",
    "also , the decrease in scatter won by pruning comes at a high price , as @xmath7030% of the sample must be rejected . in  [ sc : spiral3 ] we will use more objective , physically motivated techniques to reduce tf scatter to a level comparable to measurement - error scatter in all passbands without discarding galaxies from the sample .",
    "we have also considered independent definitions of peculiarity involving kinematic data : figure  [ fg : mfbprune]b identifies galaxies with truncated rotation curves ( @xmath77 ,  [ sc : vcalcs ] ) , rotation curve asymmetries greater than 5% ( our rc asymmetry index is defined in appendix  [ sc : asymmeast ] ) , or discrepancies between w@xmath78 and w@xmath38 greater than 10% .",
    "interestingly , galaxies with high rc asymmetry behave much like those with strong morphological peculiarities , with high @xmath71/low @xmath72 offsets .",
    "figures  [ fg : mfbprune]c and  [ fg : mfbprune]d show that pruning based on either morphology or kinematics produces a comparable reduction in scatter , although kinematic pruning misses some sa outliers .    to test whether our definitions of kinematic peculiarity have physical significance or merely identify faulty rotation curves , we have tried pruning the hi linewidth tfr using kinematic peculiarity information obtained from our optical rcs .",
    "amazingly , optical rc peculiarities are at least as effective as morphological peculiarities in flagging outliers in the hi linewidth tfr .",
    "this result implies that either ( 1 ) optical rc peculiarities are associated with observational errors in the nfgs surface photometry or the ugc - derived photometric inclinations common to both the hi and optical rc tfrs , or ( 2 ) optical rc peculiarities occur in galaxies that lie off the tfr for physical reasons .",
    "we find evidence for the latter in  [ sc : spiral3 ] .",
    "we have seen that interacting , merging , and peculiar galaxies often lie on the high @xmath71/low @xmath72 side of the tfr , while sa galaxies lie on the low @xmath71/high @xmath72 side (  [ sc : pecandsa ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fg : tfr ] shows that in addition , nfgs galaxies brighter than m@xmath79 display asymmetric scatter about the best - fit tfr for fainter galaxies , with a systematic offset of @xmath60.7 mag toward lower @xmath71/higher @xmath72 . below",
    "we demonstrate that all of these offsets reflect underlying correlations between tf residuals and quantitative galaxy properties , most notably @xmath3 color and h@xmath4 equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "following tradition , we refer to these properties as `` third parameters , '' i.e.  additional variables that control physical scatter in the two - parameter tfr .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that false correlations between tf residuals and candidate third parameters may arise when the tf slope is measured incorrectly , in which case any parameter that varies along rather than perpendicularly to the tfr will produce a correlation .",
    "a true third parameter should vary at least partly perpendicularly to the tfr .",
    "we adopt the following strategy to avoid false detections of third parameters .",
    "first , we apply strict cuts in m@xmath80 to eliminate sections of the data where the velocity width scatter is clearly asymmetric . for the r band ,",
    "these cuts are indicated by the dashed lines in figure  [ fg : tfr ] ( see also table  ): the upper line excludes galaxies brighter than m@xmath79 , which show a systematic offset as discussed above , and the lower line excludes galaxies that do not meet the m@xmath81 sample definition criterion . after these cuts ,",
    "the data are biased in m@xmath80 but nearly perfectly unbiased in velocity width .",
    "second , we apply an inverse tf fit to the data , which minimizes residuals in velocity width . at this point",
    "the velocity width residuals are completely uncorrelated with luminosity m@xmath80 .",
    "finally , we use spearman rank tests to quantify both the candidate third parameter ",
    "tf residual correlation and the candidate third parameter  luminosity correlation . for the spearman tests , velocity width residuals and magnitude residuals are interchangeable .",
    "if these tests show that the candidate third parameter correlates with tf residuals but not with luminosity , then we conclude that it varies perpendicularly to the tfr .",
    "llll bright cut & -21 & -21 & -22.5 + standard faint cut & -17 & -17 & -18 + dwarf faint cut & -16 & -16 & -17 +    in fact , even if a parameter does vary with luminosity , it may still qualify as a third parameter if it also correlates clearly with tf residuals , because we have in principle eliminated the tf residual  luminosity correlation .",
    "nonetheless , one must be wary if the parameter - luminosity correlation is stronger than the parameter ",
    "tf residual correlation , as in such a case even small tf slope errors may lead to false correlations .",
    "for luminosity - dependent parameters , one may wish to subtract out the luminosity dependence and measure the correlation between tf residuals and `` parameter residuals , '' i.e.  parameter offsets from the fitted parameter  luminosity correlation ( cf .",
    "below we give results based on raw parameters , but we have also checked our results using parameter residuals .",
    "the parameter ",
    "luminosity correlations are strongest for color and rotation curve asymmetry ( figure  [ fg : kandcvslum ] ) ; however , even for these parameters we find that correcting for the luminosity dependence makes little difference , slightly improving the third - parameter correlation if anything .",
    "in general , we use unweighted tf fits to define tf residuals .",
    "unweighted fits avoid the slope bias that would otherwise arise because our errors vary systematically with luminosity and velocity width .",
    "however , we have confirmed all correlations using both weighted and unweighted fits . we have also confirmed all correlations using two definitions of velocity width ( w@xmath78 and w@xmath38 ) and using both luminosity - dependent and luminosity - independent extinction corrections (  [ sc : extinct ] ) .",
    "results quoted in the text use w@xmath38 and the @xcite extinction corrections .",
    "we have tested a wide range of candidate third parameters , making use of photometric and spectrophotometric quantities from the nfgs database @xcite and photometric asymmetries kindly provided by r. jansen ( private communication , see also * ? ? ?",
    "for the luminosity - restricted sa  sd sample of figure  [ fg : tfr ] , tf residuals correlate strongly with @xmath82 ( effective @xmath3 color measured within the b - band half - light radius ) and global ew(h@xmath4 ) in all bands .",
    "other measures of color and emission - line strength yield somewhat noisier correlations .",
    "we also find correlations with rotation curve asymmetry , photometric asymmetry , and two measures of surface brightness ; these correlations reach @xmath703@xmath76 significance only in certain photometric bands .",
    "tf residuals do not correlate with luminosity ( by construction ) or with inclination , validating our analysis .",
    "likewise , we detect no correlation between tf residuals and rotation curve extent , isophotal radius , effective radius , hi gas mass , gas consumption timescale , or @xmath83 ( we have incomplete data for the last three however , see  [ sc : neutral ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fg : restspircorr ] displays some of the correlations in the r band and lists spearman rank test results for u , b , and r ( the `` probability of no correlation '' @xmath31 is given , where @xmath84 is the confidence of the result ) .",
    "the symbol coding shows that sa and peculiar galaxies drive most of the statistical signal in the r - band correlations .",
    "if we eliminate both groups of galaxies , no r - band correlation survives with @xmath703@xmath76 confidence .",
    "however , the @xmath82 correlation does survive in b , and both color and emission line correlations remain significant in u. in general , the two groups of galaxies contribute roughly equally to the correlations , with the sa galaxies showing a slightly stronger signal due to lower scatter .",
    "the peculiar galaxies form a more heterogeneous group , including not only interacting , merging , and warped galaxies , but also a few galaxies whose oddities may indicate later evolutionary states , e.g.a bulge - dominated sa galaxy with a prominent polar dust lane ( ngc  984 ) .",
    "although sa and peculiar galaxies dominate the statistical signal we measure , the correlations in figure  [ fg : restspircorr ] apply to all galaxies in the sample .",
    "a blue , strongly star - forming galaxy whose image does not appear peculiar nonetheless shows the expected tf residual .",
    "thus the correlations provide a physical , quantitative basis for understanding systematic offsets in the tfr , independent of morphological classification .",
    "furthermore , the correlations are not limited to the optical tfr . despite disproportionate hi catalog incompleteness for bright and peculiar galaxies , mixed hi data quality , and confusion in single - dish linewidths , we still detect 23@xmath76 correlations between radio tf residuals and both @xmath82 and global ew(h@xmath4 ) .",

    "luminosity correlation is much weaker than the hi mass  luminosity correlation in our data , this argument supports our claim that slope errors do not drive the strong correlation we observe between color and tf residuals .",
    "the existence of a well - defined tully - fisher relation for spiral galaxies suggests that for large disk galaxies , the total mass of the system ( traced by its rotation velocity ) closely couples to the mass of its stars ( traced by their luminosity ) .",
    "tf residuals may arise from any of three basic relations underlying the overall relation : ( 1 ) the relation between observed rotation velocity and total mass , ( 2 ) the relation between total mass and stellar mass , and ( 3 ) the relation between stellar mass and observed luminosity .",
    "below , we examine the possibility that variations in stellar @xmath104 due to differences in stellar populations can fully explain the color  tf residual correlation , with tf offsets interpreted as luminosity offsets .",
    "we then discuss alternative explanations for the color  tf residual correlation that interpret tf offsets as velocity width offsets that correlate with color .",
    "variations in stellar @xmath104 due to differences in stellar populations provide the simplest explanation of tf scatter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "scatter driven by population differences should be higher in bluer passbands , where variations in @xmath104 are greater , and indeed tf scatter increases from r to b to u. if there is negligible scatter in the correlation between rotation velocity and stellar mass ( i.e. , the combination of relations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above ) , then the color  tf residual correlation follows directly from the dependence of color on @xmath104 , provided that color variations are not dominated by the systematic correlation between color and magnitude ( in agreement with our observations , see  [ sc : color ] and figure  [ fg : kandcvslum ] ) .",
    "the only caveat is that different star formation histories may yield different ratios of luminosity evolution to color evolution ( @xmath105 ) , producing different tf offsets for a given color change .",
    "thus we can test the hypothesis that stellar population differences drive the color  tf residual correlation by comparing the slope of the correlation to the @xmath105 predictions of population synthesis models designed to describe the general population of spiral galaxies .",
    "we perform this comparison using the model predictions of @xcite .",

    "for the observed correlation , a forward least - squares fit yields a slope of 2.2(2.5 ) @xmath106 for the uncorrected(corrected ) correlation , while a least - squares bisector fit yields 3.5(3.9 ) @xmath106 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "the latter fit technique is more realistic as it assumes intrinsic scatter in both fit variables ; slopes measured by this technique are broadly consistent with the bell & de jong predictions but appear to favor slightly steeper values .",
    "slopes measured in the b band are also somewhat steep : e.g. while the closed box model gives a slope of 3.3 in b , we derive values of 3.2 and 4.4 using forward and least - squares bisector fits , respectively , for the color residual  tf residual correlation .",
    "the basic agreement between bell & de jong s predictions and our observations supports our interpretation of the data in terms of stellar populations . with this interpretation",
    "we find a single passband - independent stellar - mass tfr ( i.e. , our `` color - corrected '' tfr ,  [ sc : color ] ) with lower scatter than the conventional tfr and a form very similar to that predicted by bell & de jong : @xmath107 . to the extent that there is any discrepancy between observed and predicted @xmath105 ratios",
    ", the data would appear to support slightly steeper slopes than the models .",
    "this result is largely insensitive to the choice of extinction corrections , even when we omit such corrections altogether , although it is possible to push the observations closer to the models with selected analysis techniques ( e.g.  adopting the type - dependent @xmath108 described in  [ sc : saoffset ] and using colors uncorrected for the color ",
    "magnitude relation ) .",
    "if real , the steeper slopes might reflect several effects : ( 1 ) variations in dark matter fraction or dark matter structure that correlate with color ; ( 2 ) systematic velocity width offsets due to inclination errors or rotation curve distortions that correlate with color ; or ( 3 ) star formation histories that include recent starburst activity ( @xmath241 gyr ago ) , which would give @xmath105 ratios @xmath1095 ( e.g. , bell & de jong figure  5 ) . in support of option",
    "( 3 ) , many nfgs galaxies show morphological and kinematic evidence of disturbance (  [ sc : pec ] ) , suggesting the likelihood of starbursts driven by interactions , mergers , or global instabilities .",
    "we discuss options ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in the next section .",
    "we have also analyzed the color  tf residual correlation for one other complete tf sample , the ursa major sample of @xcite , and we find much shallower slopes ( @xmath61 in r , @xmath62 in b ) .",
    "these slopes are even shallower than expected purely from population synthesis .",
    "as the ursa major cluster represents a uniform moderate - density environment , the difference may be related to a greater homogeneity of star formation histories compared to what we see in the general field . in this case",
    "the tf residuals in the color  tf residual correlation might have less to do with luminosity offsets related to stellar populations and more to do with color - dependent velocity width offsets driven by one of the mechanisms described in  [ sc : voffs ] below .",
    "tf residuals are very sensitive to small offsets in velocity width because of the steep slope of the tfr . therefore any systematic velocity width trends in our data must correlate tightly with color , given the success of the color correction in reducing scatter to near measurement - error levels in all bands (  [ sc : color ] ) .",
    "possible sources of velocity width residuals include variations in dark matter fraction or dark matter structure , systematic errors in photometric inclination , and symmetric or asymmetric distortions in rotation curves .",
    "if any of these correlates strongly with color , it may offer an alternative explanation for the color  tf residual correlation in terms of velocity width offsets rather than luminosity offsets .",
    "a full consideration of dark matter structure is beyond the scope of this paper , but we can address one plausible scenario with straightforward observable consequences .",
    "halo contraction in bulge - dominated galaxies could lead to increased rotation velocities within the central parts of the galaxies , in turn driving a correlation between color and velocity width residuals insofar as higher bulge - to - disk ratios correlate with redder colors .",
    "however , the high color dispersion for later morphological types @xcite suggests a relatively weak link between colors and bulge - to - disk ratios , except for early types such as sa galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the observed rcs for our sa galaxies do not decrease in velocity in their outer parts , so we have no independent evidence that these galaxies high central concentrations have in fact increased their measured rotation velocities . extended hi data",
    "might reveal such an effect .",
    "alternatively , velocity width offsets might be driven by photometric inclination errors that correlate with color .",
    "a color  inclination error correlation could arise indirectly , via a color - morphology connection involving either bulge - to - disk ratios or morphological peculiarities , both of which can affect photometric inclination estimates .",
    "we can not directly test this possibility without kinematic inclinations .",
    "however , raising the inclination cut from @xmath14 to @xmath110 to reduce inclination - related offsets simply tightens the color  tf residual correlation , reducing its scatter without significantly changing its slope ( in the r band , the range of acceptable slopes narrows to 2.53.4 ) .",
    "furthermore , we have argued that inclination errors can not explain the sa galaxy offset , although they may contribute to it (  [ sc : saoffset ] ) , and that the link between colors and bulge - to - disk ratios is probably fairly weak .",
    "it is also hard to imagine how a heterogeneous population of peculiar galaxies could yield consistently high inclinations , as required to explain their high @xmath71/low @xmath72 offsets.21.5 in the color - corrected u - band tfr , figure  [ fg : scattred ] ( also shown in the top panel of figure  [ fg : pecgallery ] ) . its nominal photometric inclination is 42 degrees , but its inner parts appear closer to face on . if its true inclination were 20 degrees it would shift by @xmath62.8 mag , bringing it much more in line with the tfr .",
    "however , ngc  5993 is not at all typical : its offset does _ not _ follow the color  tf residual correlation .",
    "in fact , on average , spiral galaxies with peculiarities have slightly lower apparent inclination than the rest of the spiral sample ( 63@xmath22 vs.66@xmath22 ) . ] systematically high random errors for peculiar galaxies would produce a net offset in the wrong direction , due to the nonlinearity of the sine function .",
    "rotation curve asymmetries can not explain the color  tf residual correlation either , although these asymmetries do correlate weakly with both tf residuals and @xmath82 ( see  [ sc : rcasym ] ) . even supposing that a 5% asymmetry produces a 5% offset in rotation velocity ( certainly an overestimate ) , that velocity offset will in turn generate a tf residual of only @xmath60.2 mag .",
    "relatively few galaxies have asymmetries that large ( see figures  [ fg : mfbprune ] and  [ fg : restspircorr ] ) .",
    "symmetric rotation curve distortions could be more important , if these distortions correlate with color .",
    "2d velocity fields would be required to evaluate their role . @xcite",
    "have shown that intrinsically elongated disks can produce symmetric kinematic distortions , but random orientations to the line of sight will lead primarily to scatter rather than to a systematic correlation .",
    "galaxy interactions could create distortions that correlate with blue color , but a mechanism for shifting both radio and optical velocity widths in the same direction is not obvious .",
    "@xcite argue that tidal interactions broaden hi linewidths , which would actually weaken the color  tf residual correlation for the hi tfr , as would hi confusion . technically",
    ", these authors observations do not distinguish between broadening of hi linewidths and narrowing of co linewidths , which is likely to occur as molecular gas concentrates at the center of a galaxy where it does not sample the full velocity field @xcite .",

    "* ) .    in this case",
    "the divergence of the two tfrs may be due to real physical differences between the two dwarf populations , and the narrow range of properties seen for the ursa major dwarfs may simply reflect the specific environment of ursa major .",
    "the cluster consists of a moderate overdensity of spiral galaxies that lacks any discernible core , contains no elliptical galaxies , and includes surprisingly few dwarfs relative to bright galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite infer from the scarcity of dwarf galaxies in ursa major that the cluster collapsed late , so that its dwarf halos formed after reionization when conditions were poor for star formation .",
    "nonetheless , the environmental differences hypothesis should be treated with caution , because the ursa major dwarfs differ from those in the nfgs at only the 2@xmath76 level , with velocity width data missing for a few dwarfs and with the cluster membership of another dwarf in question ( see note  [ fn : umoutlier ] ; this galaxy happens to appear in both data sets ) .",
    "furthermore , we can not completely eliminate small systematic uncertainties in relative distance scale and photometric calibration between the two data sets ; a larger and more uniform data set would be required to definitively establish the existence of environmental effects .      as noted by @xcite ,",

    "dwarf galaxies on the low @xmath71/high @xmath72 side of the tfr best meet this description .",
    "these galaxies show moderate rotation curve asymmetries , indicating that they are probably rotationally supported .",
    "in addition , their long gas consumption timescales and low u - band effective surface brightnesses appear consistent with quiescent evolution .",
    "( we note that photometric `` normalcy '' is not a useful criterion for dwarfs , as almost all are lumpy and asymmetric , so defining what is `` peculiar '' becomes extremely difficult . )    figure  [ fg : slopebreak ] demonstrates the effect of selecting restricted tf samples to match the properties of the quiescent dwarfs at all luminosities .",
    "each panel shows separate tf fits for galaxies above and below m@xmath114 , first for the full tf sample , and then for subsamples restricted in turn to have low kinematic asymmetry , long gas consumption timescale , and faint u - band effective surface brightness .",
    "the faint - end fits should not be interpreted as precisely measuring the slope of the dwarf tfr , given the small number statistics and short lever arm .",
    "nonetheless , these fits clearly suggest a faint - end slope discontinuity for tf samples restricted to undisturbed , rotationally supported galaxies : the dwarfs in these samples appear underluminous when compared to the extrapolated bright - galaxy tfr .",
    "breaks in the faint - end slope of the tfr have been previously observed for extremely late type spirals @xcite and lsb dwarfs @xcite .",
    "mcgaugh et al.demonstrate that a straight tf slope ( the `` baryonic tully - fisher relation '' ) can be restored for lsb dwarfs by mathematically converting their gas into stars and correcting the luminosity for these unformed stars .",

    "we find strong third - parameter correlations between tf residuals and both @xmath3 color and ew(h@xmath4 ) .",
    "the cleanest correlations are achieved using effective colors ( measured within the effective radius ) and global equivalent widths of h@xmath4 and [ oii ] ( integrated over the entire galaxy ) . using the color  tf residual correlation in each tf band to define a color - correction term to the tfr",
    ", we reduce scatter to a single constant value across the r , b , and u bands , eliminating the usual trend of increasing scatter with bluer passbands",
    ". the remaining scatter of @xmath60.65 mag ( at a slope of @xmath810 ) approximately equals the scatter we expect from measurement errors .",
    "an ew(h@xmath4)-correction term performs equally well for the r and b - band tfrs and almost as well for the u - band tfr .",
    "the color and ew(h@xmath4 ) correlations are continuous , but their statistical signal is strongly driven by two morphology classes : peculiar galaxies ( by which we mean recognizable spiral galaxies with oddities such as warps , multiple nuclei , or interacting companions ) that fall on the high luminosity / low velocity width side of the tfr , and sa galaxies that fall on the low luminosity / high velocity width side of the tfr .",
    "this result offers a different perspective on the longstanding debate over the sa offset , by linking the offset simply to the fact that sa galaxies are consistently red .",
    "differences in star formation history offer the simplest explanation for the color  tf residual correlation : as stellar populations evolve , changes in their colors and luminosities are intimately connected .",
    "we argue that the steep slope of the correlation can not be explained in terms of a trivial correlation due to passband - dependent scatter . interpreting tf residuals as luminosity residuals ,",
    "the slope of the color  tf residual correlation can be directly compared with the predictions of population synthesis models of disk galaxy evolution .",
    "the slopes we find using r and b band tf residuals closely match the slopes predicted from the passively evolving galaxy models of @xcite .",
    "however , we find a slight suggestion of steeper slopes , which might be taken as evidence that in addition to passive evolution , many spiral galaxies experience significant starburst - driven evolution , e.g.  triggered by interactions or minor mergers ( as independently suggested by the disturbed morphology and kinematics of many of our bluer galaxies ) . variations in dark matter structure could also steepen the correlation if they were correlated with color , although we find no independent evidence for such an effect .",
    "finally , the present data set can not conclusively rule out systematic trends caused by kinematic distortions or inclination errors that correlate with galaxy color : such trends are unlikely to explain the entire color ",
    "tf residual correlation but may affect its slope .    removing the spiral morphology restriction , we find that most non - spiral galaxies brighter than @xmath2 follow the color  tf residual and ew(h@xmath4)tf residual correlations established by spiral galaxies , but with greater scatter .",
    "a few emission - line s0 galaxies at the faint end of the included range deviate strongly from both the tfr and the color  tf residual correlation ; these galaxies all show starburst or agn activity and anomalous gas kinematics .",
    "dwarf galaxies fainter than @xmath121 do not follow the color  tf residual correlation .",
    "however , dwarfs on the high luminosity / low velocity width side of the tfr have higher rotation curve asymmetries , higher u - band effective surface brightnesses , and shorter gas consumption timescales than dwarfs on the low luminosity / high velocity width side of the tfr .",
    "these properties suggest that many of the high @xmath71/low @xmath36 dwarfs are `` disturbed , '' while the low @xmath71/high @xmath36 dwarfs are likely to be passively evolving , rotationally supported systems .",
    "this split in dwarf properties implies that the faint - end slope of the tfr depends on sample selection .",
    "we find no break in slope for dwarf galaxies in the full nfgs sample .",
    "however , if we select for rotationally supported , passively evolving galaxies at all luminosities , we find evidence for a break toward steeper slope at the faint end of the tfr , consistent with recent work by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "tf samples are generally incomplete at low luminosities and low surface brightnesses , resulting in asymmetric scatter about the fundamental relation . in a fit to magnitude as a function of @xmath122 ( the `` forward '' tfr ) , this asymmetric scatter leads to artificially shallow slopes .",

    "an iterative least - squares fit with automatic 3.5@xmath76 outlier rejection yields @xmath134 we define the equivalent w@xmath29 linewidth w@xmath78 by this equation and assign it an error equal to the scatter in the fit , 25 @xmath16 .",
    "following @xcite , we define @xmath28 as half the difference between the statistical `` probable maximum '' and `` probable minimum '' velocities implied by the observed rotation curve .",
    "the probable maximum velocity @xmath135 is defined to have a 10 percent chance of exceeding all velocities in the rotation curve : @xmath136 modeling each velocity @xmath137 as a gaussian distribution about the measured value , with @xmath76 equal to the measurement error , we obtain @xmath138 which may be solved numerically for @xmath135 .",
    "the probable minimum velocity @xmath139 is defined by analogy , and @xmath140 .",
    "@xcite suggests that @xmath28 will be very sensitive to outlying points in the rotation curve , while @xcite claim the opposite .",
    "the difference seems to hinge on the size of the error bars associated with the outliers  if a high s / n cosmic ray hit masquerades as a very high - velocity data point , it may indeed throw off @xmath28 , but outlying points with large error bars will have relatively little impact . in practice , @xmath28 produces smaller scatter than @xmath26 in the optical - to - hi conversion .",
    "more importantly , as @xcite point out , @xmath28 has the virtue of using all of the data in the rotation curve without imposing any particular model on the data .",
    "the diversity of the nfgs defies modeling through a simple fitting function ( see figure  [ fg : rcgallery ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fg : w50vsopt ] shows the correlation of @xmath28 with radio linewidth w@xmath29 .",
    "an iterative least - squares fit with automatic 3.5@xmath76 outlier rejection yields @xmath141 we define the equivalent w@xmath29 linewidth w@xmath38 by this equation and assign it an error equal to the scatter in the fit , 20 @xmath16 .",
    "we compute optical rotation curve asymmetries using a technique similar to the photometric technique of @xcite . reflecting the rest - frame rotation curve about its origin , we find the average absolute deviation between the two sides , @xmath142 , and express the result as a percentage of the velocity width @xmath143 ( appendix  [ sc : vpmmdefn ] ) .",
    "our asymmetry , velocity width , and central redshift measurements are not completely independent of one another , therefore in practice we perform these calculations iteratively .",
    "asymmetry measurements depend sensitively on the choice of origin for the spatial and velocity axes .",
    "we therefore vary the position of the origin to minimize the asymmetry , keeping the spatial coordinate constrained within the one - sigma error bars of the continuum peak position , while allowing the velocity coordinate to vary freely . at each step in the minimization process",
    "we resample the rotation curve onto a uniform spatial grid about the trial origin .    to partially standardize our asymmetry index for rotation curves of differing spatial extent , we define an inner asymmetry using only points within 1.3@xmath126 ( the peak velocity position for a pure exponential disk , appendix  [ sc : vfitdefn ] ) . when the rotation curve does not extend this far , we compute the inner asymmetry from the data available .",
    "the rotation curve origin is determined by minimizing the inner asymmetry .",
    "all other analysis makes use of the total asymmetry , which we compute relative to the origin defined by minimizing the inner asymmetry ."
