    "in recent years , the physics of iridium - based 5d transition metal oxides , or iridates , has begun to attract considerable attention@xcite . due to the broad , spatially - extended nature of 5d electronic wavefunctions ,",
    "these materials tend to exhibit a combination of weak electronic correlations , strong crystal field effects , and wide electronic bands .",
    "furthermore , due to the large atomic mass of iridium , these materials also display strong relativistic spin - orbit coupling effects .",
    "in fact , the energy scale associated with these spin - orbit coupling effects ( @xmath6 @xmath3 0.3 - 0.5 ev)@xcite is often comparable to those of the electronic correlations or the crystal electric field . as a result , the iridates display considerable potential for novel spin - orbit - induced physics , and represent promising candidates for a variety of exotic electronic and magnetic ground states . in the perovskite",

    "while sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 is an insulator , its low resistivity suggests that it falls close to the metal - insulator boundary@xcite .",
    "similarly , while the system exhibits anisotropic magnetization and transport properties@xcite , its bilayer character implies that interlayer couplings are significant and may play a important role in shaping the physics of the system .",

    "neighboring octahedra are also rotated about the _ c_-axis by an angle of @xmath3 12@xmath15 , resulting in a staggered structure in which the ir - o planes within each bilayer are slightly out of phase with each other@xcite .",
    "the rotation of the iro@xmath14 octahedra is particularly important because it breaks the inversion symmetry between nearest - neighbor ir sites , leading to the development of significant dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions .",
    "the magnetism in this material arises from the magnetic moments carried by ir@xmath16 ions ( 5d@xmath17 electronic configuration ) .",
    "the octahedral crystal field environment at the ir site splits the 5d electronic states into a lower t@xmath18 manifold and an upper e@xmath19 manifold , and the splitting between these levels is sufficiently large that the ir ions adopt a low - spin s = 1/2 ground state .",
    "however , due to the presence of strong 5d spin - orbit coupling effects , the low - lying t@xmath18 manifold is further split into a four - fold degenerate j@xmath8 = 3/2 band and a two - fold degenerate j@xmath8 = 1/2 band .",
    "the lower - lying j@xmath8 = 3/2 levels become fully occupied , while the j@xmath8 = 1/2 band remains half - filled . from this point ,",

    "the muon precession signal in sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 undergoes a qualitative change below t @xmath3 25 k , suggesting some form of change in the ordered spin structure at low temperatures .",
    "the magnetic structure of sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 has recently been investigated using both resonant magnetic x - ray scattering@xcite and conventional neutron scattering techniques@xcite .",

    "in particular , we have studied how the magnetic bragg peaks in this compound evolve as a function of temperature and field , performing detailed rmxs measurements under both zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) conditions .",

    "note that the [ h , h,0 ] peak width decreases substantially upon field - cooling , and becomes almost resolution - limited at h = 0.1 t. the application of higher magnetic fields ( h = 0.5 t ) results in a slight additional narrowing of the magnetic bragg peak , giving rise to a fully resolution - limited lineshape and correlation lengths consistent with long - range magnetic order .",
    "the field dependence of the correlation lengths can be investigated in a more quantitative fashion by performing simple lorentzian fits to the data sets provided in figure 5 .",
    "these fits can be used to extract a value for the fwhm of the magnetic peak , @xmath45 .",
    "this observed peak width is related to the intrinsic width of the magnetic peak by the expression @xmath46 = @xmath47 , where @xmath48 refers to the fwhm of the experimental resolution function . in this case , @xmath48 can be determined from the fwhm of a nearby structural bragg peak .",
    "the relevant magnetic correlation lengths can then be extracted from the expression @xmath49 = [ ( 2@xmath35/d)(@xmath46/2)]@xmath50 . along the interlayer stacking direction , we find correlation lengths of @xmath3 200  .",

    "this difference in correlation lengths along the [ h , h,0 ] and [ 0,0,l ] directions may reflect the layered quasi-2d structure of sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 , which naturally favors longer and better defined correlation lengths within the strongly coupled ir - o layers .",
    "alternatively , it may reflect the presence of defects in the stacking sequence , which are known to occur quite commonly in many stacked bilayer compounds .",
    "given the significant impact of field - cooling on the phase diagram of sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 at low fields , it is only natural to investigate the effects of higher fields on the system as well . in the single - layered iridate sr@xmath1iro@xmath7 ,",
    "a field - induced magnetic `` spin - flop '' transition has been reported at h@xmath12 = 0.2 t [ ref .",
    "this transition is characterized by a change in the stacking sequence of the canted af magnetic structure , with the canted moments rotating to align the net magnetization of each layer with the direction of the applied field . due to the apparent similarities between the antiferromagnetic ground states of sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 and sr@xmath1iro@xmath7",
    "there is strong motivation to believe that similar spin - flop transitions could also occur in this compound .",
    "in addition , magnetization measurements on sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 suggest that there is some significance to the energy scale of h @xmath3 0.25 t , as this is magnitude of the the field required to suppress the magnetization drop below t@xmath4 [ ref . 1 ] .",

    "figure 5(b ) provides representative [ 1/2,1/2,l ] scans collected at the h = 0 t and h = 4 t end - points for the field - scans presented in figure 5(a ) .",
    "the lack of change in the magnetic peak intensity suggests that there is no difference in the magnetic structure at h = 4 t , while the absence of any change in peak width indicates that there is no difference in magnetic correlation lengths along the interlayer stacking direction .",
    "in addition , exploratory survey measurements at h = 4 t revealed no evidence of new magnetic bragg peaks forming at previously forbidden positions .",
    "we conclude that there are no high - field magnetic phase transitions in sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 for applied fields of up to h = 4 t.     direction at h = 0 t and h = 4 t. all measurements shown here were collected at t = 5 k using @xmath35-@xmath34 polarization analysis .",

    "in order to understand the temperature and field dependence of the magnetic bragg peaks , it is useful to consider the behavior of the antiferromagnetic order parameter , m@xmath51 .",
    "this order parameter , which is equivalent to the staggered magnetization of the system , is proportional to the square root of the scattering intensity observed at the antiferromagnetic ordering wave - vector ( i.e. i @xmath52 m@xmath51@xmath53 ) . as a result",
    ", the magnetic peak intensities displayed in figure 3(b ) can be taken as a direct measure of the antiferromagnetically - aligned component of the ordered moments .",
    "this can be compared to the magnetization measurements presented in figure 3(a ) , which provide a measure of the ferromagnetically - aligned component of the ordered moment .",
    "recent theoretical calculations@xcite suggest that there are two potential magnetic ground states for sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 which possess almost equivalent ground state energies .",
    "these ground states correspond to g - type af orderings with either a collinear af spin configuration ( magnetic easy - axis parallel to the _ c_-axis stacking direction ) or a canted af configuration ( magnetic easy - axis within the _ ab_-plane ) .",
    "each of these spin configurations gives rise to a different value of m@xmath51 , with the larger m@xmath51 corresponding to the collinear af state ( since m@xmath51 will be maximized when the ordered spins are antiparallel ) , and the smaller m@xmath51 corresponding to the canted af state ( since m@xmath51 will be reduced by a factor of cos@xmath54 when the spins are canted by an angle @xmath54 with respect to the magnetic easy - axis ) .",
    "while the value of @xmath54 for the canted af state has not yet been determined experimentally , theoretical calculations suggest that it should be approximately equal to the angle of the octahedral rotations ( @xmath54 @xmath3 12@xmath15)@xcite .    applying these ideas to the data in figure 3(b )",
    ", it follows that the zfc magnetic ground state can be associated with the collinear af spin configuration , while the fc ground state can be associated with the canted af configuration .",
    "as these states are very close in energy , even small perturbations may be sufficient to drive the system from one state into another .",
    "this would explain the anomalous suppression of the zfc peak intensity below t@xmath4 @xmath3 50 k , as well as the sudden increase in fc and zfc peak intensity below t @xmath3 30 k. these transitions can both be interpreted as spin reorientation transitions , resulting from changes in the canting angle of the ordered moments . in the first case , the zfc anomaly at t@xmath4 @xmath3 50 k represents a transition from collinear af to canted af . in the second , the fc / zfc anomaly at t @xmath3 30 k represents a transition from canted af to collinear af .",
    "if we assume that the magnetic easy - axis in the canted af state is given by the @xmath55110@xmath56 direction closest to the applied field , and the canting angle is given by @xmath54 @xmath3 12@xmath15 , then it is possible to calculate a theoretical intensity ratio for the two magnetic ground states .",
    "since the direction of the magnetic easy - axis rotates by 90@xmath15 between the collinear and canted af states , this intensity ratio must incorporate two multiplicative factors : ( 1 ) a factor of cos@xmath54 due to the change in canting angle , and ( 2 ) an additional factor of * m * @xmath37 * k@xmath33 * due to the polarization dependence of the rmxs cross section in vertical scattering geometry@xcite .",
    "the resulting theoretical intensity ratio , i@xmath57/i@xmath58 = 0.77 , agrees very well with the observed difference in magnetic peak intensities at intermediate temperatures ( i@xmath59/i@xmath60 = 0.71 @xmath40 0.08 )",
    ".    given this proposed sequence of spin reorientation transitions , it is somewhat surprising that no additional low temperature anomalies are observed in the zfc magnetization data .",
    "this may be explained by the relatively short zfc magnetic correlation lengths determined in section iiic .",
    "if the magnetic order in the zfc state is predominantly short - ranged , with many small coexisting magnetic domains , then the resulting magnetization curve could be largely featureless ( as observed in figure 3(a ) ) .",
    "the large enhancement of m@xmath23 under fc conditions would then simply be a consequence of the applied field encouraging the formation of larger magnetic domains within the sample , since it will be energetically favorable for the net ferromagnetic moment from the canted spins in each domain to align with the direction of the applied field .",
    "the relative complexity of the fc / zfc magnetic phase diagram of sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 is likely a consequence of the interplay between three sets of competing interactions : conventional isotropic heisenberg superexchange , anisotropic dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions , and pseudodipolar ( pd ) interactions associated with the j@xmath8 = 1/2 state . while the detailed properties of these interactions can be quite complex , in general the isotropic superexchange interactions",
    "will favor the formation of a collinear ordered state , while the anisotropic dm interactions will favor a canted state . the interlayer pd coupling is believed to favor a collinear state , while the effect of the intralayer pd term depends on the tetragonal distortion of the iro@xmath14 octahedra ( favoring canted order for axial compression , and collinear order for axial elongation)@xcite . the balance between these interactions may be altered by the presence of applied field or by simple structural changes as a function of temperature . in general , sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 exhibits a stronger tendency for collinear ordering because the ir ions in neighboring bilayers are stacked directly on top of each other .",
    "in addition , because the direction of the octahedral rotations alternates between adjacent ir - o layers , the dm interactions within this compound are inherently frustrated .",
    "x - ray structure refinements performed on our single crystal samples of sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 indicate that the magnitude of the iro@xmath14 octahedral rotations changes from @xmath3 11.75@xmath15 at room temperature , to @xmath3 12.52@xmath15 at t = 90 k. this increased octahedral rotation is likely to enhance the magnitude of the dm interactions which favor the canted af state .",
    "sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 has also been found to exhibit anisotropic thermal expansion .",
    "as the system is cooled from room temperature to t = 90 k , structural refinements indicate that the _ a_-lattice constant shrinks by @xmath61a / a = 1.6 * 10@xmath62 , while the _ c_-lattice constant expands by @xmath61c / c = 0.8 * 10@xmath62 .",
    "this result is supported by recent lattice parameter measurements performed using neutron scattering techniques@xcite .",
    "this anisotropic lattice expansion may also alter the shape of the iro@xmath14 octahedra , with the larger _",
    "c_/_a _ ratio leading to a greater elongation along the axial direction . as the tetragonal distortion",
    "is intimately associated with the intralayer pd interactions , this type of structural change would be likely to favor an increased tendency towards collinear magnetic order@xcite .",
    "similar physics has also been observed in the distorted perovskite yvo@xmath0@xcite . like sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2",
    ", this compound undergoes a series of magnetization reversals and spin reorientation transitions upon cooling .",
    "one of these magnetization reversals ( at t@xmath63 @xmath3 77 k ) is driven by a change in orbital ordering which results in a different jahn - teller structural distortion that favors a new spin configuration@xcite .",
    "however , the other reversal ( at t * @xmath3 95 k ) has been attributed to changes in canting angle driven by the competition between conventional heisenberg superexchange ( which favors collinear af order ) , dm interactions , and single ion anisotropy ( both of which favor canted af order , although not necessarily with the same ordering wave vector)@xcite .",
    "although the role of orbital ordering is certainly different in these two systems , this situation appears to offer strong parallels to the case of sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 , where a shifting balance between three sets of competing interactions as a function of temperature also results in an unusual series of spin reorientation transitions .",
    "in summary , we have carried out a series of detailed resonant magnetic x - ray scattering measurements on single crystal sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 . in particular ,",
    "these measurements have focused on the evolution of the magnetic bragg peaks as a function of temperature and applied field .",
    "this work is complementary to previous magnetization studies on this compound performed by cao et al@xcite .",
    "our rmxs results indicate that sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 displays interesting field - induced magnetic behavior , particularly when field - cooled in the presence of modest applied fields ( 0 @xmath5 h @xmath5 0.25 t ) .",
    "we find evidence of magnetic bragg peaks along the [ 1/2 , 1/2 , l ] direction in reciprocal space , consistent with the formation of g - type antiferromagnetic order with multiple magnetic domains .",
    "these magnetic bragg peaks develop at t * @xmath3 260 k under both zfc and fc conditions .",
    "interestingly , this transition temperature is significantly below the first magnetic transition ( t@xmath12 = 285 k ) which is identified in bulk characterization measurements@xcite .",
    "we propose that the major features of the h - t phase diagram for sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 can be understood in terms of competition between two magnetic ground states characterized by collinear af and canted af spin configurations .",
    "these two states can be distinguished by the magnitude of the antiferromagnetic order parameter , m@xmath51 , which is larger for the collinear af state than the canted af state . under zfc conditions",
    ", sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 appears to favor the collinear af state from t * down to t@xmath4 @xmath3 50 k. below t@xmath4 , the system undergoes a spin reorientation transition and adopts a canted af spin configuration . below t",
    "@xmath3 30 k , the ordered structure appears to change again , reverting to a collinear af state which persists down to the lowest measured temperature . under fc conditions",
    ", it is the canted af state which is stabilized from t * down to t@xmath4 . at t@xmath3 30 k the fc system appears to undergo a similar spin reorientation transition , and the canted state is replaced by a collinear af state that persists down to base temperature .",
    "in addition to influencing the magnetic phase diagram of sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 , field - cooling in modest applied fields also encourages the formation of large magnetic domains , and leads to a significant enhancement of magnetic correlation lengths within the _ ab_-plane .",
    "the effect of higher fields was investigated by measuring the field dependence of magnetic bragg peaks in applied fields of up to h = 4 t along the [ 1@xmath430 ] direction . unlike the single - layered iridate sr@xmath1iro@xmath7 , which undergoes a spin - flop transition at h@xmath12 @xmath3 0.2 t [ ref .",
    "15 ] , sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 does not appear to exhibit any field - induced phase transitions for h @xmath5 4 t. we hope that these results will help to stimulate future theoretical and experimental work on sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 , as well as the other members of the sr@xmath9ir@xmath10o@xmath11 series .",
    "in particular , we believe there is now significant motivation for detailed magnetic and structural refinements on this compound as a function of temperature and applied field . it is important to clarify the nature of the magnetically ordered state between t * and t@xmath12 , as well as to confirm the orientation of the magnetic moments in the canted and collinear af states .",

    "<S> we have performed resonant magnetic x - ray scattering ( rmxs ) measurements on single crystal samples of the bilayer iridate sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the development of antiferromagnetic order below t * @xmath3 260 k , which persists down to t = 4 k under both field - cooled ( fc ) and zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the fc and zfc magnetic bragg peaks suggests the presence of competition between canted and collinear antiferromagnetic ground states . under zfc conditions , </S>",
    "<S> we observe a suppression of magnetic peak intensity at t@xmath4 @xmath3 50 k which can be attributed to a spin reorientation transition . under fc conditions , we find that the canted antiferromagnetic state is stabilized over a much wider range of temperatures , with significantly enhanced magnetic correlation lengths within the ir - o layers . </S>",
