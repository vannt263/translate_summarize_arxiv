    "there are three clarifications that must be made about our results .",
    "firstly and quite obviously , the gauge invariance of the single - particle effective actions is not manifest because we have expanded results to second order in the external field . in infinite volume ,",
    "the charge couplings are exactly fixed by ward identities , while in a compact space additional gauge invariant terms lead to renormalization of charges and currents .",
    "because we treat the time direction as infinite , charge is not renormalized .",
    "the possibility to renormalize spatial born - level couplings in a gauge invariant manner has been thoroughly detailed using a momentum - space analysis  @xcite , and we reproduce the findings of that work using a complementary coordinate - space method .",
    "finite volume corrections to polarizabilities show up as coefficients to field squared terms , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "these terms , moreover , can be further split into various gauge invariant terms .",
    "for example , at second order in the electric field strength one can not distinguish between operators of the form @xmath129 because both terms have the form of polarizability operators at second order .",
    "another way to implement a constant electric field on a torus is to use the vector potential @xmath130 for which the operator @xmath131 vanishes . on a torus , however , the vector potentials , eqs .   and , are not related by a gauge transformation",
    ". consequently the finite volume shift of the polarizability ( defined as the coefficient of the @xmath127 term of the effective action ) will be different .",
    "a direction for future investigation is to classify all possible gauge invariant , single - particle operators allowed on a torus , and determine the running of their coefficients with the lattice volume . in this way",
    ", one could determine how to implement the external field with minimal volume corrections .",
    "secondly the finite volume renormalization of charge - squared couplings must be addressed to properly fit hadron correlation functions .",
    "let us focus on the electric case .",
    "for the charged pion , this is relatively straightforward .",
    "the two - point function arising from the effective action in eq .",
    "has precisely the form of eq .",
    "projected onto zero three - momentum with the mass replaced by the effective mass , namely @xmath132 , and the charge - squared replaced by the renormalized charge - squared . because eq .   at zero momentum",
    "is an even function of the charge @xmath133 , the latter can be achieved simply by the trick @xmath134 \\right)$ ] . while chiral perturbation theory estimates the latter at the few percent level ,",
    "this expectation can be confirmed by treating the charge - squared as a free parameter in fits to charged pion correlation functions . }",
    "\\notag , \\ ] ] where @xmath135 depends on the effective charge squared @xmath136 $ ] . ] the neutral pion , however , presents difficulty due to the sign of the renormalized charge - squared coupling .",
    "the two - point function derived from eq .   for",
    "the neutral pion appears as eq .",
    "projected onto zero three - momentum , with @xmath137 , and @xmath138 necessitating analytic continuation .",
    "the two - point function acquires an imaginary part due to the instability in eq .   for negative charge",
    "this imaginary part is exponentially small provided either the electric field strength is small , @xmath139 , or the pion compton wavelength is small compared to the lattice size , @xmath140 . in practice , this should thus be a very small effect . all neutral particles potentially have this difficulty .",
    "if the renormalized charge - squared is positive , we merely use eq .   with @xmath141 , and their correlation functions should look like the zero - momentum projection of charged particle correlation functions . in particular , they will not be simple exponentials at long times . if , on the other hand , the renormalized charge - squared is negative ( as is the case for the neutral pion ) , our only recourse is to attempt to fit the correlation function using the real part of the analytically continued two - point function .",
    "this procedure relies on the hope that the imaginary part is numerically insignificant to allow treatment in euclidean space .",
    "notice for the connected part of the neutral pion two - point function , this issue does not arise because @xmath142^{\\text{connected}}_{\\text{qem } } = 0 $ ] .",
    "thirdly the choice of coordinate origin is ordinarily arbitrary . in backgournd fields on a torus , however , this is no longer the case , as was pointed out for an electric field , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "focusing on the electric case and the gauge potential in eq .",
    ", we observe that two - point correlation functions for both charged and neutral particles at finite volume will depend on the source time . in infinite volume",
    "this was already the case for charged particles via eq .  .",
    "for neutral particles , charge - squared couplings are generated from infrared effects , and a neutral hadron source will thus break discrete time - translational invariance . another way to shift",
    "the time is through the gauge potential in eq .  .",
    "we are free to translate @xmath143 in infinite volume as it corresponds to a gauge transformation .",
    "in finite volume , this shift in time leads to an additional coupling of the matter fields to a constant gauge potential @xmath144 that can not be gauged away on a torus .",
    "the effect is equivalent to a twisted boundary condition on the matter field , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "consequently a hadron with charge @xmath60 acquires kinematic momentum , @xmath145 .",
    "one can extend the analysis formulated here to this flavor - twisted case by working at non - zero spatial momentum .",
    "volume effects can be computed  @xcite , however , the expectation is that broken symmetries will lead to extra finite volume terms  @xcite .",
    "this complication notwithstanding , effects on the two - point function can be determined . on general grounds",
    ", we expect all terms in the single particle effective action to be renormalized including the current , or equivalently the momentum . as was the case for periodic boundary conditions",
    ", neutral particle correlation functions will no longer have a simple exponential falloff at long times .    using the methods established here , many subsequent investigations are possible .",
    "of particular interest is the calculation of finite volume effects for baryon electromagnetic properties .",
    "these too can be addressed using the present framework .",
    "in order to reliably extract these quantities from lattice qcd simulations in background fields , one must ascertain whether volume corrections are as sizable as in the meson sector ."
