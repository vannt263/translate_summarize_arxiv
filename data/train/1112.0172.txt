    "according to general relativity @xcite , a black hole ( named by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a region of space - time around a collapsed mass with a gravitational field that has became so strong that nothing ( including electromagnetic radiation ) can escape from its attraction , after crossing its event horizon @xcite .",
    "the problem of such catastrophic gravitational collapse was first adressed by @xcite when he discovered the upper mass limit for ideal white dwarfs , composed of a degenerate electron - gas .",
    "subsequent studies by @xcite and @xcite established the modern theory of gravitational collapse . the theory of black holes , as well as their fundamental properties are presented in numerous monographs and papers ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and therefore in this review we will focus only on those studies which are necessary for the discussion of the relation between black holes and the fe k@xmath0 spectral line .    all black holes in nature are commonly classified according to their masses as : supermassive black holes ( with masses @xmath1 ) , intermediate - mass black holes ( @xmath2 ) , stellar - mass black holes ( @xmath3 ) , mini and micro black holes ( @xmath4 ) . a crucial event for the acceptance of black holes",
    "was the discovery of pulsars by @xcite , because it was the clear evidence of the existence of neutron stars , and therefore , confirmation of chandrasekhar limit .",
    "the first detection of a solar mass black hole came in 1972 , when the mass of the rapidly variable x - ray source cygnus x-1 was proven to be above the maximum allowed for a neutron star ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    nowadays",
    ", it is widely accepted that supermassive black holes are located in the centers of most of galaxies , and thus have a fundamental influence on galactic formation and evolution .",
    "some of the first indirect arguments that they exist in galactic nuclei are given by @xcite and @xcite . also , according to the unification model of active galactic nuclei ",
    "agn @xcite , they are most likely powered by the accretion of gas onto their central supermassive black holes with mass ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 @xcite .      in general , black holes have three measurable parameters ( not including the hawking temperature ) : charge , mass ( and hence gravitational field ) and angular momentum ( or spin ) . in the case of supermassive black holes ,",
    "only the latter two are of sufficient importance because they are responsible for several effects which can be observationally detected ( for more details see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".    a central supermassive black hole of a galaxy can be stationary or rotating . in the first case ,",
    "space - time geometry in the black hole vicinity depends only on its mass @xmath7 and is described by the schwarzschild metric @xcite , while in the latter case , space - time geometry depends also on spin @xmath8 ( i.e. angular momentum @xmath9 ) of the black hole and is described by kerr metric @xcite .",
    "therefore , schwarzschild metric describes the spherically symmetric gravitational field around a time - steady non - rotating black hole in vacuum , while the kerr metric describes the gravitational field outside an uncharged rotating black hole and , contrary to the schwarzschild metric , is no longer spherically symmetric .",
    "@xcite discovered a generalized coordinate system in which kerr metric is most commonly used today ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "several characteristic radii can be defined around black holes , and the most important are ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "schwarzschild radius @xmath10 ( representing the limiting radius below which a collapsed mass form a spherically symmetric non - rotating black hole ) , where @xmath11 is the gravitational constant and @xmath12 is the speed of light ; 2 .",
    "gravitational radius @xmath13 ( being a half of @xmath14 and usually used as a unit for distance around a black hole ) ; 3 .",
    "radius of event horizon @xmath15 ( representing space - time boundary below which events can not affect an outside observer ) ; and 4 . radius of marginally stable orbit @xmath16 ( representing the minimum allowed radius of a stable circular equatorial orbit around a black hole ) .",
    "the equations governing photon trajectories in the kerr metric are derived by @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that certain relativistic effects in vicinity of a black hole , such as light banding , gravitational and doppler shifts as seen by distant observer could be computed by solving the equation of the photon orbit .",
    "@xcite calculated radiation of a point source in a circular orbit in the equatorial plane around an extreme kerr metric black hole ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "@xcite studied the effects of accretion from a disk of gas orbiting a black hole on its properties , and showed that the kerr metric is more appropriate for describing supermassive black holes than the schwarzschild metric .",
    "this conclusion is strengthened even more by @xcite , who showed that a black hole at the center of an accretion disk would be spun up to the maximum possible value of @xmath17 in a relatively short time .",
    "in such a case the disk would be extended down to about 1.23 @xmath13 , while in the case of a non - rotating black hole it could extend only down to 6 @xmath13 .",
    "some observed quasars have luminosities of up to @xmath18 erg / s @xcite .",
    "the corresponding total energy emitted during the lifetime of such quasars can be estimated to @xmath19 erg , assuming that their minimum age is about @xmath20 years and that their luminosities do not change significantly over the lifetime @xcite .",
    "accretion is the only mechanism which can yield sufficient efficiency @xmath21 ( defined as the mass fraction of fuel that is converted into energy , according to @xmath22 ) to explain such high energies .",
    "the maximum efficiency of accretion is about @xmath23 for a non - rotating black hole and @xmath24 for a maximally rotating one @xcite .    on the other hand , if the cold matter which was initially at rest and without magnetic field , was subjected to free radial infall it would accrete to the central black hole without any energy release or observational effects @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of agn the accreting matter has a significant angular momentum which does not allow its free infall . at the marginally stable orbit of central black hole with mass of @xmath25 ,",
    "the specific angular momentum is @xmath26 , which is much less even in comparison to a typical galaxy where the speciffic angular momentum of orbiting material is @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "it means that approach of accreting material toward a black hole requires a loss of the greatest fraction of its initial angular momentum .",
    "mechanisms which can contribute to such loss of angular momentum are viscosity , nonaxisymmetric gravitational forces , magnetic forces @xcite , outflowing winds @xcite , or the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) which was discovered by @xcite and @xcite , but did not come to the attention of the astrophysical community until rediscovered by @xcite .",
    "since the orbit of minimum energy for fixed angular momentum in any spherically symmetric potential is a circle , the infall of accreting material due to loss of its angular momentum will be in form of successively smaller and smaller concentric circles .",
    "matter traveling along orbits inclined to each other will eventually collide in the plane of intersection , and as a result , the angular momenta of different gas steams will be mixed and equalized .",
    "consequently , all accreting matter will orbit in a single plane and will have the same specific angular momentum at any given radius , meaning that accretion is most likely performed through an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the assumption of a disk geometry for the distribution of the x - ray emitters in the central parts of agn is also supported by the spectral shape of the observed fe k@xmath0 line @xcite .",
    "@xcite developed what is now called ",
    "standard model of accretion disk  , in which accretion occurs via an optically thick and geometrically thin disk and where the spectrum of thermal radiation emitted from the disk surface depends on its structure and temperature , and therefore on the distance to the central black hole .",
    "the distribution of the temperature along the radius of the disk in this model is presented in fig . [ fig02 ] ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "this model was originally developed to describe the accretion disks around stellar sized black holes in the binary systems , but with certain modifications it could be also applied on accretion disks around central supermassive black holes of agn .",
    "the total energy release of emitted radiation is mainly determined by the rate of matter inflow into the disk on its outer boundary , i.e. by its accretion rate @xmath28 .",
    "if the accretion converts matter to radiation with fixed radiative efficiency @xmath29 ( in rest - mass units ) , then a characteristic scale for the accretion rate is the eddington accretion rate for which the total release of energy in the disk @xmath30 is equal to the eddington luminosity , a critical luminosity beyond which the radiation force overpowers gravity for any given mass @xcite .",
    "observed agn have luminosities from @xmath31 to @xmath32 erg / s , which means that their central black holes must have masses from @xmath5 to @xmath6 @xcite .    using the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) ,",
    "@xcite found strong evidence for a disk of ionized gas around a supermassive nuclear black hole in m87 .",
    "@xcite performed magnetohydrodynamic simulations of an accretion disk as seen by a distant observer at four different inclinations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) .",
    "these simulations showed the existence of especially bright regions in form of arcs within the turbulent flow , which trace out the photon trajectories close to the radius of marginally stable orbit .",
    "these arcs are much brighter on approaching side of the disk due to higher surface temperature , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , and also due to doppler boosting and relativistic beaming which both enhance the flux observed in the direction of motion and diminish the flux in the opposite direction .",
    "the influence of these relativistic effects on the shape of the fe k@xmath0 line emitted from the accretion disk will be explained in more details in  2.3 .",
    "some observational studies suggest that the broad fluorescent / recombination iron k@xmath0 line at 6.4 kev originates from the innermost part of accretion disk , close to the central black hole .",
    "for example , using xmm - newton observation of the broad - line radio galaxy 4c 74.26 , @xcite found a broad fe k@xmath0 line emitted from a region which had inner radius close to the innermost stable circular orbit ( @xmath16 ) for a maximally spinning black hole and outer radius within 10 @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the broad fe k@xmath0 line is an important indicator of accreting flows around supermassive black holes . at the same time , it is the strongest line of the x - ray radiation , and it can be found in the spectra of all types of accreting sources : binary black hole and neutron star systems , cataclysmic variable stars and agn .",

    "broadening of the fe k@xmath0 line arises mostly from general relativistic effects and large rotational velocities of material emitting near the black hole . using _ asca _ satellite observations , @xcite found that , in case of 14 seyfert 1 galaxies , full - widths at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of their fe k@xmath0 lines correspond to velocities of @xmath36 km / s . in some cases ( e.g. for seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ) ,",

    "in addition to intrinsic causes such as a disk instability , the fe k@xmath0 line variability could also be induced by some external effects , such as absorption by x - ray absorbers or gravitational microlensing @xcite .",
    "observations of so - called low ionization broad absorption line quasars ( e.g. mrk 231 * ? ? ? * ) and ( h 1413 + 117 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) confirmed the presence of x - ray absorbers in these objects .",
    "@xcite detected an absorption line at 5.8 kev in nearby seyfert 1.5 galaxy ngc 4151 and a variable absorption line at the same energy has been discovered by @xcite in ngc 3516 . it was interpreted as a fe k resonant absorption line , redshifted either by infalling absorbing material or by strong gravity in the vicinity of the black hole .",
    "a model of the fe k@xmath0 line absorbing / obscuring regions in form of absorbing medium comprised of cold absorbing cloudlets was developed by @xcite .",
    "another model , which assumes that absorbing region is composed of a number of individual spherical absorbing clouds , was developed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that a compact gravitational microlens could induce noticeable changes in the fe k@xmath0 line profile when the einstein ring radius associated with the microlens is comparable to the size of the accretion disk .",
    "also , the x - ray continuum could experience significant amplification during such microlensing events @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that cosmologically distributed gravitational microlenses could significantly contribute to the x - ray variability of high - redshifted ( @xmath60 ) quasars .",
    "indeed , microlensing of the fe k@xmath0 line has been reported at least in three lensed quasars with multiple images : mg j0414 + 0534 @xcite , qso 2237 + 0305 @xcite , and h 1413 + 117 @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected an increase of the fe k@xmath0 equivalent width in the image b of mg j0414 + 0534 which was not followed by the continuum and explained this behavior by assumption that the thermal emission region of the disk and the compton up - scattered emission region of the hard x - ray source lie within smaller radii than the iron - line reprocessing region .",
    "@xcite also measured amplification of the fe k@xmath0 line in component a of qso 2237 + 0305 . for more detailed discussion about observational and theoretical investigations of the fe k@xmath0 line variability due to gravitational microlensing",
    "see e.g. @xcite and @xcite , as well as references therein .",
    "in order to demonstrate the consequences on the fe k@xmath0 line of some general relativistic and strong gravitational effects , which are significant only near the marginally stable orbit , we performed ray - tracing simulations ( using approach proposed by * ? ? ? * ) of a disk emission from its innermost regions .",
    "for that purpose we analyzed several cases for disk inclination and spin , assuming that the disk extends from the @xmath16 to 10 @xmath13 , which is the region where the line is most likely produced in most agn ( see e.g * ? ? ?",
    "the obtained results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] . as one can see from the fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] , for all studied inclinations there are significant differences between the simulated line profiles in the case of non - rotating and maximally rotating black hole . in the latter case",
    "the line profiles are generally wider and more extended towards lower observed energies ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) , due to fact that the disk extends from the radius of marginally stable orbit , which is much smaller in this case @xcite .",
    "this effect , when observed , gives opportunity to measure black hole spin , and thus to have insight into space - time geometry in its vicinity .",
    "at the same time , as a consequence of gravitational redshift , the  blue ",
    "peak is more smeared than the  red  one in the case of maximally rotating black hole .",
    "therefore , comparisons between the observed and simulated fe k@xmath0 line profiles enables us to investigate the effects of strong gravitational field predicted by general relativity",
    ". however , since the spectrum  reflected  from the disk may contain not only a single iron line , but also many fluorescent lines and a continuum reflection component ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , accurate modeling of the underlying reflected and direct components is crucial in using the fe k@xmath0 line as a diagnostic of general relativity in the strong field regime .    except the black hole spin , the disk inclination also have significant influence on the line profile , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] . for small inclinations , i.e. in the case of almost face - on disk ,",
    "the single peak profiles of the fe k@xmath0 line are obtained . for inclinations about @xmath61 ,",
    "the faint  red  peak is the most emphasized .",
    "it is interesting that this value is close to the averaged value of @xmath62 , estimated by @xcite from the study of the fe k@xmath0 line profiles of 18 seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the results of previously mentioned observational and theoretical studies indicate that the broad fe k@xmath0 line which originates in vicinity of the supermassive black holes is a powerful tool for studying their properties , space - time geometry ( metric ) in their vicinity , their accretion physics , probing the effects of their strong gravitational fields , and for testing the certain predictions of general relativity .",
    "however , some important scientific issues still need to be addressed , such as decoupling the narrow and broad fe k@xmath0 line components and explaining their different variabilities ( see e.g * ? ? ?",
    ". this will be one of the crucial steps in determining the real importance of relativistic effects on the observed fe k@xmath0 line profiles .",
