    "due to its relevance for a variety of scientific disciplines such as physics , chemistry , biology , economics and social sciences , the study of collective phenomena in extended stochastic systems with long range interaction has been of great interest in recent years and various techniques based on langevin , fokker - planck and master equations have been conceived to explore their dynamics .",
    "an effective and simple model for the study of noise induced collective phenomena is the globally coupled network of stochastically driven bistable elements .",
    "indeed , the cooperative dynamics of these systems has been the subject of many studies and its relevance for critical phenomena @xcite , spin systems @xcite , neural networks @xcite , genetic regulatory networks @xcite and decision making processes in social systems @xcite has been pointed out .    for the sake of simplicity",
    "it has traditionally been assumed that the interactions in these networks are instantaneous .",
    "however , in recent years it has been realized that time delays due to finite transmission and processing speeds are 1 ) significant compared to the dynamical time scales of the system and 2 ) often change fundamentally its dynamical properties @xcite .",
    "thus , in this paper the generic model of globally coupled bistable elements is extended by time delayed couplings and its collective dynamics is studied numerically and analytically .",
    "the properties of globally coupled dynamical units , relevant for system such as arrays of lasers @xcite and josephson junctions @xcite , have been explored in many studies ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite , for instance , studied the synchronization of noise activated bistable oscillators with instantaneous coupling and derived from the fokker - planck equation for the joint probability distribution of the oscillators an exact mean field model ( dz - model ) in the thermodynamic limit @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of network elements . beyond a critical coupling strength this system displays a second order phase transition to an ordered nontrivial stationary state .",
    "the effect of uniform interaction delays in a globally coupled network of phase oscillators has been explored by @xcite , and @xcite studied the dynamics of a single noise activated bistable element with delayed feedback . combining the properties of these two systems , @xcite studied the properties of a globally coupled network of noisy bistable elements with uniform delays and derived a dichotomous mean field model based on the delay - differential master equation .",
    "although for numerous systems the assumption of uniform time delays is justified ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most systems have time delays distributed over an interval rather than concentrated at a point ( see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , after a discussion of the dynamical properties of the network with uniform delays , the generalized case of distributed time delays is studied .",
    "this paper which is an extended version of @xcite is organized as follows : in the next section the bistable - element - network is discussed for the case of uniform time delays .",

    "the global coupling leads to an asymmetry of the local potential ; that is , a positive feedback increases the probability for an element to be in the potential well in which the majority of elements were at time @xmath9 .",
    "the inverse holds for a negative feedback .    system ( [ languniform ] ) is explored numerically . in this paper ,",
