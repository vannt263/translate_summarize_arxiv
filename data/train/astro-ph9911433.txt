    "the existence of a compact and massive dark - matter core in the galaxy cluster , which is much smaller than the x - ray gas core of the empirical @xmath6 model , has recently acquired substantial supports from various evidences .",
    "it has been recognized since the early study of the very thin arclike images of distant galaxies created by the potentials of the foreground lensing clusters that the dark matter profiles of the lensing clusters should be sharply peaked towards cluster centers ( e.g. hammer 1991 ) . in order to account for the total number of observed giant luminous arcs , the core size of dark matter distribution modeled by a softened isothermal sphere should be at least @xmath8 times smaller than the one for luminous matter profile ( wu & hammer 1993 ) .",
    "grossman & saha ( 1994 ) strengthened this argument by explicitly setting an unprecedentedly small upper limit on cluster core radius , @xmath9 kpc , for a softened isothermal sphere .",
    "many recent work on modeling of arcs / arclets have essentially confirmed these findings ( e.g. giraud 1999 ; william , navarro & bartelmann 1999 ) . even for the x - ray measurements of hot intracluster gas",
    ", the dynamical analysis also arrives at a similar conclusion that the binding matter distribution of clusters should have a core radius of @xmath10 kpc ( durret et al .",
    "optically , the omni - presence of cd galaxies in the cores of many rich clusters may indicate unusual accumulation of central masses .",
    "finally , a singular mass profile of @xmath11 at cluster center is predicted by the numerical studies of cluster formation in the framework of the standard cdm model as well as other cosmological models ( e.g. navarro et al .",
    "1995 ; cole & lacey 1996 ; navarro , frenk & white 1997 ; fukushige @xmath12 makino 1997 ; eke , navarro & frenk 1998 ) .",
    "such a singular mass profile also houses a weak compact core .",
    "that is , while the cluster x - ray gas often shows a core of typical size about @xmath13 kpc , the dark matter core can instead be substantially smaller than @xmath14 kpc .",
    "the co - existence of two distinct mass cores in a single cluster appears to have challenged our current understanding of cluster formation .",
    "although a great deal of theoretical efforts have in the past been put forth attempting to grasp an understanding of the cluster physics , few have considered the possibility of a massive compact dark matter core in the galaxy cluster .",
    "past analytic investigations for the gravitational infall of matter into galaxy clusters have been pursued mainly toward the following two issues : the cosmic evolution of cluster properties such as the total mass , number counts , gas luminosity and temperature ( e.g. gunn & gott 1972 ; press & schechter 1974 ; kaiser 1986 ; 1991 ) , as well as the gas and dark matter density profiles inside clusters ( e.g. fillmore & goldreich 1984 ; bertschinger 1985 ; teyssier , chize , & alimi 1997 ) .",
    "regardless of their oversimplification , these analytic treatments based on self - similar models indeed provide the gross properties of clusters that were shown to be in gross consistency with optical / x - ray observations ( kaiser 1991 ) .",
    "moreover , these analytical studies can also reveal the underlying cluster evolution mechanisms , in a complementary manner to those shown by the particle and hydrodynamic simulations . in spite of the past success , previous studies commonly obtained ( or assumed ) a single core within the cluster .    in the self - similar regime ,",
    "clusters are , however , shown to undergo very rapid evolution ( gunn & gott 1972 ; kaiser 1986 ) . when these results are combined with the recent observations made primarily at x - ray wavebands , which demonstrate that no evolution has been detected within the redshift at least out to @xmath15 among the cluster number counts , x - ray luminosity , temperature function as well as typical scale lengths ( e.g. fan , bahcall & cen 1997 ; rosati et al .",
    "1998 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "1998 ; wu , xue & fang 1999 and references therein ) , one is led to a conclusion that the evolution of these clusters must have ended at an early epoch .    in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the dark matter and the galaxy / gas distributions of clusters revealed mainly by the saturated state of a new class of self - similar infall model , which describes the simultaneous build - up of two distinct cores in a single cluster .",
    "our starting point differs from the past theoretical models in the following way : ( a ) unlike the previous work which chose a power - law initial perturbation in the mass ( e.g. fillmore & goldreich 1984 ; teyssier et al .",
    "1997 ) , we seek a solution to the infall problem of dark matter particles by assuming an initial compact seed density fluctuation at the site of growing cluster .",
    "this aspect is in line with the works of gott ( 1975 ) and bertschinger ( 1985 ) , and the large - amplitude seed fluctuation may arise from a non - gaussian peak in the primordial density fluctuations .",
    "( b ) instead of assuming the collisionless particles to move with radial orbits ( merritt , tremaine & johnstone 1989 ) , which are known to be unstable ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , we consider the other extreme situation where the particle orbits inside the cluster are so chaotic that the velocity dispersion is essentially isotropic .    after a substantial growth of both cores",
    ", they can rapidly reach a saturated state , in which the mass ratio of the two cores remains approximately the same as that during the infall phase .",
    "( this is because both cores are gravitationally bound , and they have been grossly virialized regardless of whether there exists an infall . )",
    "our attempt at comparing the theoretical predictions with observational results will therefore be made at this late stage when the matter infall has ended , and a hydrostatic equilibrium has already been established between the dark - matter gravitational potential and the cluster galaxies and intracluster gas .",
    "we begin in section 2 by presenting a specific model describing the self - similar evolution of spherical collapse of collisionless cold dark matter in an open and a closed universe .",
    "( the former also represents the situation where the infall began only recently and is still ongoing in a flat universe . )",
    "we then derive the density profiles of dark matter in the infall phase and in the saturated phase , respectively . in section 3 the predicted dark matter distribution and the galaxy / gas density profiles",
    "are compared with those revealed by the gravitational lensing and optical / x - ray observations .",
    "finally , the discussion and summary are given in section 4 .",
    "beginning from section 3 , where comparisons of the theoretical predictions with the observations are made , we work mainly with the saturated state ( except in section 3.1 ) , and the hubble constant is chosen to be @xmath16 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 for convenience . throughout this work , we set the cosmological constant equal to zero .",
    "assuming the linear growth of an overdense spherical top - hat perturbation , gott ( 1975 ) and bertschinger ( 1985 ) have derived that a bound object can grow , as a result of matter infall from the pressureless hubble flow , with the time dependence : @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the total mass within the radius @xmath21 of the growing bound object and @xmath22 is the evolution time .",
    "such a scaling relation depends only weakly on the decelerating parameter @xmath23 ( for @xmath24 ) , and these relations become exact when @xmath25 .",
    "a slightly different scaling relation has also been predicted by press and schechter ( 1974 ) in their quest for the galaxy mass function .",
    "they found that @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "a feature common to both scaling relations is that the characteristic length scale @xmath21 is approximately a linear function of time .",
    "this behavior will be used to fix the temporal scaling of velocity as @xmath28 in our self - similar model .    on the other hand , the crossing of mass shells near the core can trigger particle orbit instabilities that yield violent relaxation ( lynden - bell 1967 ) .",
    "the particle orbits may be further randomized by the interactions with the crowded discrete galaxies in the cluster , making the dark matter particles further mixed .",
    "we therefore approximate the dark matter within the cluster to have an isotropic and also spatially uniform velocity dispersion @xmath29 .",
    "together with the temporal scaling discussed in the last paragraph , one may consider @xmath29 to be a constant in space and in time within the cluster .",
    "( for readers who have a different view of how the dark matter particles should behave in the cluster , they may simply regard the constant @xmath29 as a working hypothesis adopted to fix the self - similar scaling relations . ) outside the cluster , the cold dark matter detached from the expanding background hubble flow falls radially inwards .",
    "the boundary of the hot cluster and cold background is defined by a heat conduction front , across which both mass flux and momentum flux are continuous .    thus , our picture of the self - similar matter infall can be summarized as follows .",
    "as the cold dark matter falls towards the massive compact core , a volume of finite radius surrounding the compact core then undergoes violent relaxation and forms an isothermal halo , which gives rise to the cluster potential",
    ". a small fraction of the infall particles can however sink into the compact core and therefore the peak of the central density can grow steadily ( gott 1975 ) .",
    "but the majority of infall particles are deflected back to the halo .",
    "the deflected particles find the halo to become more massive than they previously experienced due to the continuing infall , and hence the particles can travel only up to a maximum radius , which defines the location of the conduction front , i.e. , the boundary of the hot cluster . as these processes continue , both compact core and halo can grow self - consistently .    to put this picture into a quantitative perspective , we adopt a spherically symmetric infall model .",
    "since the particle orbits are assumed to be isotropic in the cluster bulk , the anisotropic stress force is unimportant and it suffices to consider only the radial pressure force in the momentum balance .",
    "the unique self - similar scaling with a constant @xmath29 requires the mass density of dark matter particles @xmath30 , the flow speed @xmath31 and the total mass @xmath32 enclosed within radius @xmath33 to be scaled as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the distance in a comoving frame .",
    "the continuity equation in the comoving frame then becomes @xmath38 this equation can be rewritten as @xmath39 . comparing this equation with the relation between @xmath40 and @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 , we find that the mass @xmath41 can be expressed as @xmath43 .",
    "this expression of @xmath44 is substituted into the gravitational force to eliminate @xmath44 in the momentum equation .",
    "re - arrangement of the momentum equation @xmath45 and eq.(2 ) yields @xmath46\\frac{dv}{dx}=         \\left[\\alpha(x - v)-\\frac{2}{x}\\right](x - v),\\\\ \\left[(x - v)^2 - 1\\right]\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{d\\alpha}{dx}=                \\left[\\alpha-\\frac{2}{x}(x - v)\\right](x - v).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that eqs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) have been derived in the past for describing the inside - out collapse of a singular isothermal molecular cloud ( shu 1977 ) .",
    "however , our boundary conditions are different from those for the molecular cloud , in that the hot cluster is fed from outside by the expanding cold dark matter , and inside , the collisionless matter lands onto the compact core at a vanishing speed so that the particles can be captured .",
    "by contrast , the collapsing molecular cloud is fed from outside by a static isothermal gas sphere ; inside , the collapsing gas lands on the protostar violently with a mach number much greater than unity , and it relies eventually on the radiative cooling for the infall matter to be captured by the prostar .",
    "eqs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) can be simplified when the dark matter is cold , by setting the pressure term on the right of eq.(3 ) to zero .",
    "it yields @xmath47 these equations are valid for the background dark matter particles before falling within the cluster . note that both eqs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) , and eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) allow for the hubble - flow solution of a flat universe where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "finally , the most relevant regime consistent with the current observations corresponds to a final saturated and static configuration when the matter infall ended before the present .",
    "that is , most of the available dark matter particles have collapsed into the cluster . under these circumstances ,",
    "such a saturated system is completely determined by the static forces in eq.(3 ) : @xmath50 here , we have kept the same dimensionless parameterization although the dark matter density and mass are now time - independent .",
    "the additional factor @xmath51 in this dimensionless parameterization should be interpreted as the duration of cluster formation .",
    "our inner boundary condition of eqs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) is so chosen that a growing massive compact core is present .",
    "for the collapsed particles to settle into the compact core , we demand that the cluster bulk flow should have a vanishing infall speed at the core .",
    "quantitative details as to how the matter falls into the compact core will be further elaborated below .",
    "far from the cluster , we demand the pressure - free dark matter solutions to obey eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) , and they must either asymptotically match to a vanishing - density background when @xmath52 , or asymptotically match to the hubble flow ( @xmath53 ) when @xmath54 .",
    "these pressure - free , outer infall solutions are then matched to the interior subsonic cluster solutions of eqs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) through a co - moving conduction front .",
    "technically , we must adjust both the location and strength of the conduction front to determine a unique solution satisfying both inner and outer boundary conditions .",
    "the background density of hubble flow in this regime assumes a value @xmath55 , and our outer infall solution should asymptotically decrease to match this low - density background far from the cluster .",
    "practically , this boundary condition demands the asymptotic outer infall solution to vanish at large distances .",
    "we shall stress that the solution to the open - universe case can also represent the situation where the self - similar infall began only recently in a flat universe , in which case @xmath51 is redefined as @xmath56 , with @xmath57 being the starting time of infall and @xmath51 much less than the cosmic age @xmath22 . as will be shown in the following analysis",
    ", the conduction front has a density @xmath58 , much greater than the background density , e.g. , the critical density @xmath59",
    ". therefore the outer cold infall solution should asymptotically match the vanishingly small background density at large distances .",
    "such a boundary condition is exactly the same as the open - universe case .",
    "we shall briefly return to this case in section 3.2 for a comparison with observations .",
    "the outer pressure - free solution is constructed from a remote location far from the cluster by integrating eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) inward . to ensure that the solution beyond the starting distance of integration indeed asymptotically matches onto the background flow",
    ", we perform an asymptotic analysis for the large - distance solution .",
    "the large - distance solution of eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) is @xmath60 and @xmath61 . that is",
    ", the density @xmath40 and velocity @xmath62 must be related in this specific way to warrant that the density asymptotically decreases to a sufficiently low value and matches onto the low background density . however , since eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) are actually nonlinear equations , the amplitude @xmath63 must also be constrained in such a way that the outer infall solution be matched to the interior hot cluster solution through a conduction front . in this regard",
    ", the amplitude @xmath63 can be taken as a nonlinear eigenvalue imposed at the outer boundary .",
    "moreover , the interior cluster solution is demanded to possess a diminishing velocity when the flow enters the compact core , so that the infall matter can be captured by the growing compact core .",
    "this requires a unique location for the conduction front as the second nonlinear eigenvalue .    to meet these non - trivial conditions , we find it useful technically to search for an approximate solution of eqs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) , which makes a smooth transition from a subsonic infall in the bulk to a supersonic infall into the core",
    "this is because the trans - sonic solution is at the bifurcation boundary in the solution space ( shu 1977 ) , and our desired solution is in the neighborhood of this boundary .",
    "the desired solution can then be constructed relatively easily after the approximate solution is found .",
    "conditions for a flow to smoothly pass through the sonic speed are @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where the subscript @xmath66 denotes the sonic point which is a critical point of eqs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) .    by adjusting both the amplitude @xmath63 of the asymptotic background solution and the location @xmath67 of the sonic critical point",
    ", one may uniquely determine the location of and density jump at the conduction front , across which the mass flux and momentum flux in the co - moving frame are continuous .",
    "our numerical search shows that the approximate solution has @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and the location of the conduction front at @xmath70 .",
    "upstream of the conduction front , the dark matter density @xmath71 and infall speed @xmath72 , whereas downstream of the front , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this conduction front has a moderate compression ratio @xmath75 .",
    "an eigenvalue search in the neighborhood of this trans - sonic solution permits us to obtain the desired solution easily , which turns out to differ from the trans - sonic solution only near the compact core . as previously stated , the transonic solution is the bifurcating solution , and it has an infall speed increasing inward moderately .",
    "on one side of this bifurcation boundary , the infall speed increases drastically inward , but on the other side the infall speed turns around to become vanishingly small toward the core .",
    "( these situations are not unlike the behaviors of the scaling factor @xmath76 in a flat universe , an open universe and a closed universe . ) clearly , the latter is what we look for . as the desired solution and trans - sonic solution are almost identical in most part of the cluster , their conditions at the conduction front are practically the same .",
    "a caveat for our results is that the collisionless conduction front is likely to have a transition layer of finite thickness .",
    "hence the results given above can only be regarded as a sophisticated estimate for modeling the boundary of the cluster , and the discontinuity obtained here should not be taken too literally .",
    "the derived density profile of dark matter flow can be fit nicely by an analytical form : @xmath77    two separate components for the interior cluster solution are identified .",
    "the first component @xmath78 gives rise to a peaked density profile , in response to the gravity of massive compact core ; the second component represents the usual bonner - ebert state of isothermal sphere , which has a secondary core of size @xmath79 , and the density outside the outer core decreases outward first as @xmath80 and subsequently as @xmath81 .",
    "the conduction front is located roughly at the transition between the @xmath80 and @xmath81 profiles .",
    "the matter located in the region from @xmath82 to @xmath83 can be well approximated by a `` static sphere '' , where the flow speed is roughly zero . near the conduction front the infall speed sharply rises , and the finite flow speed immediately downstream of the conduction front serves only to flatten the density profile slightly . at about @xmath84 ,",
    "the mass within this sphere is twice as much as that of the compact core ; that is , the gravity arising from the massive compact core begins to be overwhelmed by the self - gravity of the matter outside the compact core .",
    "figs.1(a ) ,",
    "( b ) and ( c ) depict the normalized density , velocity and mass profiles , respectively .",
    "note that most part of the hot cluster is almost static , except near the conduction front and immediately outside the compact core .",
    "the compact core is a virialized bound object , where the density rises inwards more steeply than @xmath85 .",
    "as shown in fig.(1 ) when the dark matter particles fall within @xmath84 , they experience solely the core gravity and are accelerated inward to reach a maximum speed at @xmath86 . inside @xmath87 ,",
    "the infall suddenly gets retarded by the core pressure and its speed decreases from this point on and becomes vanishingly small at the core center .",
    "to pin down where the true core boundary is , we examine the binding energy . inside the core",
    ", the flow must satisfy the binding condition , @xmath88 , so that no particle may escape outside the radius @xmath36 once enters .",
    "the specific potential energy @xmath89 at the radius @xmath36 is @xmath90 , and the specific kinetic energy @xmath91 includes the specific thermal energy @xmath92 and the comoving flow energy @xmath93 .",
    "our solution shows that only inside @xmath94 can the binding condition be satisfied .",
    "the size of the compact core is thus set to be @xmath95 .",
    "the asymptotic solution far away from the cluster behaves as @xmath96 and @xmath97 , when the deviation from the hubble flow is small .",
    "we may employ the technique used in the previous case to obtain the solution in this regime .",
    "surprisingly , the trans - sonic solution yields a conduction front at almost the same location and with a comparable jump as those of the previous case .",
    "the nonlinear eigenvalue @xmath67 for the trans - sonic solution is also the same .",
    "in addition , the nonlinear eigenvalue @xmath98 also assumes a value equal to @xmath99 . as a result",
    ", we find that the desired solution interior of the cluster is nearly the same as that of the previous case .",
    "the outer cold infall solution is , however , different from that in eq.(9 ) ; the following analytical expression is found to fit the outer cold infall solution : @xmath100      taking the typical dark - matter velocity dispersion , @xmath101 1000 km s@xmath17 , and the typical size of an abell cluster , @xmath5 mpc , it follows that the typical time scale for cluster growth is on the order of @xmath102 years , a short time compared with the age of the universe .",
    "moreover , no strong cosmic evolution for clusters since @xmath0 has been detected by recent x - ray observations ( rosati , et al .",
    "1988 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "it is , therefore , reasonable to assume that most clusters have reached saturated states by @xmath103 .",
    "the comparison of observations with the present model is to be made primarily for the saturated state , where the clusters are virialized .",
    "because the central compact core is strongly gravitationally bound , the core should remain intact in the saturated phase , and the core size and mass are frozen to their values immediately before the infall stopped .",
    "note that the extra factor @xmath51 that makes eq.(7 ) dimensionless can be interpreted as the cosmic age at which the infall ended for an early formed cluster .",
    "therefore , we may conveniently choose the same values of compact core mass ( @xmath104 ) and size ( @xmath95 ) as those of the infall phase for the static cluster solution .",
    "the integration of eqs.(2 ) and ( 7 ) can be carried out from the compact core outward to a sufficiently large distance to obtain the static cluster solution .",
    "the solution construction is straightforward once the core size and mass are specified .",
    "the resulting density profile of dark matter is plotted in fig.1(d ) and can also be fit by an analytical form : @xmath105 the density near the core also behaves as @xmath106 , and again has a secondary outer core @xmath107 , beyond which the dark matter decreases outward also from a @xmath108 profile to @xmath109 profile at large distances .",
    "the corresponding profiles are depicted in fig.1(c & d ) .    in sum , for the solutions of both ongoing - infall ( open universe ) and early - infall ( flat universe ) cases , the interior hot clusters are found to be almost identical .",
    "this result to some degree reinforces the assertion of gott ( 1975 ) that the self - similar evolution of bound objects depends weakly on the deceleration parameter . in the saturated phase",
    ", we have assumed that the compact core is frozen to the configuration immediately before the infall ended , and obtained a saturated cluster configuration that departs only slightly from those of the infall phase .",
    "we also find that the plausible value for the compact core radius approximately equals @xmath110 and the core mass , @xmath111 .",
    "taking a typical cluster for which @xmath112 corresponds roughly to 1 mpc and a typical velocity dispersion @xmath31000 km s@xmath17 , we estimate @xmath113 0.5 kpc and the compact core mass about @xmath114 .",
    "in this section , the predicted dark - matter distribution in the galaxy cluster will be tested against the observed results of gravitational lensing , galaxy distribution , gas distribution and baryon fractions .",
    "the rationale behind such a comparison is that if the theoretical prediction can well approximate the true dark - matter distribution , a single gravitational potential given by the predicted dark - matter distribution ought to be able to produce consistent profiles for these different observations .",
    "our strategy is therefore first to use the gravitational lensing data to calibrate the length scale and depth of the gravitational potential , which are related to the only two parameters , @xmath51 and @xmath29 , in the theoretical model .",
    "once the potential is fixed by the lensing data , the baryons will be treated as test particles , which should be so distributed as to be in dynamical equilibrium with the potential .",
    "however , the construction of galaxy and gas distribution also requires an additional knowledge of their `` equations of state '' . for galaxies ,",
    "we adopt the average profile of the observed galaxy velocity dispersion and for gases , a polytropic equation of state .",
    "though it can be relatively easy to find the best galaxy and gas parameters for a theoretical model to compare well with the observations , we would like to go one step beyond , and to constrain the choice of these empirical parameters based on a physical principle .",
    "that is , we consider the dark matter particles , galaxies and gases to have already been grossly virialized , and they should share a common _ averaged _ velocity dispersion since they are all within a common gravitational potential .",
    "it is under this additional constraint that the comparisons will be made .",
    "gravitational lensing appears to be a powerful and unique tool at present for probing the total matter distribution of galaxy clusters .",
    "it provides the gravitating masses of clusters regardless of the matter compositions and dynamical states .",
    "so far , the strongly and weakly distorted images of background galaxies have been detected in about 50 clusters at intermediate redshifts ranging from @xmath115 to @xmath15 .",
    "these clusters constitute a good sample of matter distributions on scales @xmath116 kpc ",
    "mpc , both individually and statistically for testing various mass density profiles advocated by theoretical and observational studies . a direct comparison between our solution eq.(11 ) and",
    "the gravitational lensing results is straightforward , provided that the evolutionary time @xmath51 and the velocity dispersion @xmath29 of dark matter particles are known . on the other hand ,",
    "such a comparison will allow us to fix these two free parameters , if the self - similar solution predicts a consistent mass profile with what is derived from the gravitational lensing . due to the cosmic variance",
    ", these two parameters can only be fixed sensibly by the averaged mass profile of the lensing results .",
    "before we fix these parameters by the averaged lensing results , a comparison with two individual clusters is presented to illustrate how well the theoretical profile may agree with the observed profiles individually , and not just statistically .",
    "fig.2 shows the projected radial mass distributions of two distant clusters at @xmath15 , ms1137 + 66 and rxj1716 + 67 , obtained recently by employing the mass reconstruction technique for the detected weak distortions of distant background galaxies ( clowe et al .",
    "also plotted are the 2-d mass profiles from eq.(11 ) for ( @xmath29 , @xmath118)=(850 km s@xmath17 , 1.5 mpc ) and ( @xmath29 , @xmath119)=(1000 km s@xmath17 , 0.6 mpc ) , respectively .",
    "( from now on , the quantity @xmath51 should , unless otherwise indicated , be interpreted as the cluster formation time scale . )",
    "it appears that the self - similar solution does yield an acceptable fit to the results of ms1137 + 66 and rxj1716 + 67 .",
    "moreover , the required values of velocity dispersion , @xmath120 km s@xmath17 , for dark matter are also in good agreement with the observed x - ray luminosity of the two clusters , @xmath121 erg s@xmath17 in the energy band 0.33.5 kev . meanwhile , the scale length @xmath122 mpc indicates a comfortable cluster formation time of @xmath123 yrs .",
    "this apparent success encourages us to conduct a comparison between the overall radial mass distribution of clusters revealed by the strong / weak lensing and that predicted by our analytical solutions .",
    "note that in most cases , only the rich and x - ray luminous clusters of galaxies at intermediate redshifts are capable of gravitationally distorting the background galaxies .",
    "namely , the ( strong ) lensing clusters alone are a fair sample of massive clusters at @xmath124 in the universe .",
    "we display in fig.3 the mean projected cluster mass @xmath125 within @xmath33 , derived from a total of 49 arcs / arclets in 38 clusters and 134 weak lensing measurements made among 24 clusters ( wu et al .",
    "1998 and reference therein ) , in which we have not included the result of a2163 . while there may exist a discrepancy between the strong and weak lensing measured cluster masses , the cluster masses obtained from three different lensing phenomena , including the deficit of red galaxy population detected behind a1689 due to the lensing magnification ( taylor et al .",
    "1998 ) , are essentially consistent within @xmath126 error bars .",
    "the radial mass variation of the lensing clusters from our self - similar solution with @xmath127 km s@xmath17 and @xmath128 mpc is also demonstrated in fig.3 .",
    "the good fitness of our prediction to the lensing result is clearly seen .",
    "since the velocity dispersions of optical galaxies in lensing clusters are in the range of 600  2000 km @xmath17 with an average value of 1200 km s@xmath17 ( wu et al .",
    "1998 ) , the required mean velocity dispersion of dark matter particles @xmath127 km s@xmath17 is more than acceptable .",
    "consequently , the mean formation time of the lensing and massive clusters turns out to be @xmath129 yrs .",
    "this timescale seems to be relatively short though it is not impossible for the very rich clusters ( gunn & gott 1972 ) .    with the same velocity dispersion and scale length parameters ,",
    "our theoretical results produce equally good fits for the mass profiles given by both the static solution of eq.(11 ) and the collapsing solution of eq.(9 ) .",
    "the latter should now be interpreted as the solution of a growing cluster which began its formation only recently .",
    "also shown in fig.3 is that the difference between the mass profiles is only minor , leading to an inability to observationally distinguish the two models simply from their mass profiles . to differentiate these two models , it is helpful to recall some established observational evidences of galaxy clusters .",
    "it was shown more than a decade ago that optical counts of clusters did not exhibit any evolutionary tendencies for redshift out to at least @xmath130 ( gunn , hoessel , & oke 1986 ) .",
    "the same conclusion holds true for the x - ray selected clusters since redshift of as high as @xmath131 ( rosati et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) . furthermore",
    ", no significant differences in the dynamical properties between low - redshift and high - redshift clusters , such as the x - ray luminosity - temperature relationship , the velocity dispersion - temperature relationship ( mushotzky & scharf 1997 ; wu et al . 1999 ) , and the baryon fraction ( see fig.7 ) , have been detected .",
    "in particular , the distribution of core radii of the intracluster gas in nearby clusters is identical to that of distant clusters ( @xmath132 ) ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "this last point can be regarded as the most convincing evidence for the already `` settled '' configuration of cluster matters , but sharply discords with an evolving self - similar model , which predicts the core radius to be much smaller in the past ( kaiser 1986 ) . suggested by these evidences",
    "can be that significant matter infall processes should have already ended before @xmath133 so that the global properties of galaxy clusters have remained approximately unchanged since an even earlier epoch .",
    "the rationale of the following exercise goes as follows . from the massive - cluster samples measured by gravitational lensing",
    ", we have statistically determined the mean velocity dispersion @xmath134 1300 km s@xmath17 ) and the mean length scale @xmath118 ( @xmath135 mpc ) , thereby fixed the average mass and length scales of our solutions for massive clusters .",
    "this predicted average solution hence has _ no _ adjustable parameter .",
    "so , we may employ the jeans equation to construct an expected average galaxy distribution and compare it with the observed average galaxy distribution within the massive clusters .",
    "so far we have not yet included the baryonic matter ( galaxies and gas ) in our self - similar solutions of dark matter particles in clusters .",
    "although an exact self - similar solution with a proper combination of the collisionless dark matter and the collisional gas infall can be constructed , we would rather take a less vigorous approach to this problem by treating the baryons as test particles . for galaxy populations characterized by their radial velocity dispersion @xmath136 and number density @xmath137 , the jeans equation under the light - traces - mass hypothesis reads @xmath138 where @xmath20 is the total cluster mass ( we use dark matter instead ) enclosed within radius @xmath33 , and @xmath139 denotes the velocity anisotropy parameter .",
    "since the above equation corresponds to a purely hydrostatic equilibrium , we employ the static solution , eq.(11 ) , to evaluate @xmath140 .",
    "( the collapsing solution , eq.(9 ) , has also been tested , and essentially the same @xmath140 is obtained . ) once the velocity profile @xmath136 and @xmath139 are specified , we can easily work out the galaxy number density profile according to eq.(12 ) .",
    "we compare our prediction with the average surface number density of galaxies over 14 distant clusters measured by the canadian network for observational cosmology ( cnoc ) ( carlberg , yee , & ellingson 1997 ) .",
    "actually , the majority of the 14 clusters are those massive lensing clusters discussed in the above subsection .",
    "we adopt the simple form of the radial velocity dispersion suggested by cnoc , @xmath141 and the assumption for a zero anisotropy parameter , @xmath142 . here",
    ", @xmath143 is the central velocity dispersion and @xmath144 denotes the radius within which the mean cluster mass density is 200 times the critical mass density of the universe ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "the mean value of @xmath144 over the 14 cnoc clusters has been found to be @xmath146 mpc .    with the predicted gravitational potential of the underlying dark matter and the given profile of observed velocity dispersion of galaxies , one can solve for the average galaxy distribution using the jeans equation , eq.(12 ) . in the following comparison , we will instead take an alternative route by first seeking the best fit parameters and then examine how well they may agree with those fixed by the lensing results .",
    "fig.4 shows the cnoc galaxy surface number density @xmath147 and the predicted galaxy surface number density from our model for the best fit @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "when combined with @xmath146 mpc , this choice of length scale @xmath150 mpc ) is what has previously been determined by the gravitational lensing .",
    "the good fit of the predicted length scale with the observed length scale is remarkable .",
    "the magnitude of the predicted surface number density depends sensitively on the central velocity bias @xmath151 .",
    "its best fit value being less than unity may simply reflect the fact that the central galaxy velocity @xmath143 is higher than the average value @xmath152 .",
    "to pin down the ratio of the averaged specific kinetic energy of galaxies to that of dark matter particles for this value of @xmath143 , we calculate @xmath153    a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath154 . that is , the best - fit central velocity bias @xmath151 renders the average specific kinetic energies of both dark matter particles and galaxies to be approximately equal , as required by our principle set forth to constrain the empirical parameters .",
    "the good agreement is more than surprising for such a simple theoretical model .",
    "actually , it has already been seen in the above subsection that the velocity dispersion of dark matter particles ( @xmath127 km s@xmath17 ) , required to account for the projected mass distribution of clusters derived from gravitational lensing , is roughly the same as the reported mean value for the cnoc galaxies ( @xmath155 km s@xmath17 ) ) .",
    "this is also in agreement with the previous results given by a statistical comparison of cluster mass determinations from gravitational lensing and velocity dispersion of cluster galaxies as the tracer of cluster potential ( wu & fang 1997 ; wu et al .",
    "1998 ) .      similarly ,",
    "the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium can also be applicable to the hot x - ray emitting gas of number density @xmath156 in clusters ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) : @xmath157 in which @xmath158 is the `` equivalent velocity dispersion '' of gas with @xmath159 being the mean particle mass . assuming an equation of state for the gas @xmath160^{\\gamma-1}$ ] , we can write out the gas number density profile in terms of eq.(14 ) : @xmath161^{1/(\\gamma-1)},\\ ] ] where @xmath162 is the physical length corresponding to @xmath163 .",
    "motivated by the fact that @xmath164 , the arbitrariness of the polytropic index @xmath165 and @xmath166 can be fixed by a physical requirement that @xmath167 also equals @xmath29 , where @xmath167 is the average equivalent velocity dispersion of gas : @xmath168 the observed x - ray surface brightness is related to the temperature and number density of electrons in clusters as @xmath169 provided that the radiation mechanism is the thermal bremsstrahlung with a gaunt factor weakly dependent on @xmath170 .    before proceeding to a discussion on the general properties of the theoretically predicted x - ray surface brightness profile ,",
    "we first present a comparison of the predicted profile with the observed x - ray surface brightness of an individual cluster for an illustration of the agreement that also holds individually .",
    "figure 5 shows a typical example of the _ rosat _ observed @xmath171 for cluster cl0016 + 16 ( @xmath172 ) , together with our expected @xmath173 from eqs.(15 ) and ( 17 ) .",
    "the latter are obtained by properly choosing the length scale parameter @xmath119 and the central biasing parameter @xmath174 or equivalently the polytropic index @xmath165 .",
    "this procedure is somewhat equivalent to the conventional @xmath6 model fit by properly determining the x - ray core radius and the power index . yet , unlike the @xmath6 model which is purely an empirical formula , our predicted x - ray surface brightness profile is given by the hydrostatic equilibrium of the intracluster gas with the underlying gravitational potential of the cluster dark matter particles . the physics behind our prediction about the gas distribution",
    "is well understood .",
    "fig.6 shows the x - ray surface brightness profiles of clusters obtained from eqs.(15 ) and ( 17 ) for a set of polytropic indices @xmath1751.05 , 1.1 , 1.2 and 1.3 , in which we have imposed a constraint on @xmath174 by requiring @xmath176 , which uniquely defines a central biasing parameter @xmath174 for each value of @xmath165 .",
    "we now superpose the conventional @xmath6 models on the theoretically expected @xmath177 .",
    "surprisingly , all the derived @xmath177 profiles can be well approximated by the @xmath6 models except near the compact cores , where brightness cusps may appear in some cases .",
    "the allowed @xmath6 parameters are dependent on the adopted @xmath165 , with a smaller @xmath6 for a large @xmath165",
    ". additionally , our fitted @xmath6 parameters are consistent with the observed @xmath6 parameters in the range of @xmath178  @xmath179 .",
    "if the average value of @xmath180 is indeed around @xmath181 as indicated by most current observations , we may conclude that a large proportion of galaxy clusters should have a mean polytropic index of @xmath7@xmath182 .",
    "this point has recently been verified by the x - ray measurements of temperature structures of 30 nearby clusters ( markevitch et al .",
    "1998 ) , all of which show similar temperature profiles with a polytropic index of @xmath183@xmath182 .",
    "on the other hand , the above fits for various @xmath165 s yield that the core radius of the gas profile varies from @xmath184 to @xmath185 . of these , the choice for @xmath183 that yields @xmath186 is again of particular interest .",
    "since if the mean length scale @xmath119 is approximately @xmath117 mpc for rich clusters , as was shown in the above two subsections , this choice implies a mean core radius of @xmath187 mpc in @xmath177 ; this core radius is comparable to the median values ( 0.210.24 mpc ) of the x - ray core radius distributions of the _ rosat _ detected clusters ( vikhlinin et al . 1998 ) . taking these results as a whole",
    ", we have provided a consistent scenario for the physical origin of the conventional @xmath6 model .    in sum",
    ", our fit suggests that the gas components of clusters have an overall polytropic index close to @xmath7 and a mean @xmath6 parameter @xmath188 .",
    "it is worth stressing again that by requiring the ratio of mean specific kinetic energy in galaxy to that in gas to be unity , @xmath189 , the two @xmath6 values , @xmath190 and @xmath191 , turn out to agree nicely with the observationally determined ones ( wu , fang & xu 1998 ) .",
    "the two @xmath6 s are not the same , and the so - called `` @xmath6 discrepancy '' ( bahcall & lubin 1994 ; references therein ) appears to be a natural consequence of our model .",
    "we have also noticed that a similar effort was recently made by makino , sasaki & suto ( 1998 ) based on the universal dark matter profile .",
    "however , while their derived x - ray surface brightness is well represented by the @xmath6 model in shape , their predicted core radius is a factor of ( 310 ) smaller than the actually observed values .",
    "having known the dark matter and gas distributions , we can easily provide the baryon ( gas ) fractions of clusters @xmath192 , where @xmath193 and @xmath194 are the gas and total masses enclosed within the radius @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "of course , the absolute value of @xmath195 is ultimately related to the amplitude of gas density profile , @xmath196 , which has remained unknown thus far .",
    "although we shall be able to figure out @xmath196 using the observationally determined baryon fractions , a particular attention is paid to the issue of how the baryon fractions vary with scales .",
    "fig.7 demonstrates the cluster baryon fractions versus radii obtained through the deprojection analysis of _ einstein observatory _",
    "data for 207 clusters ( white , jones & forman 1997 ) .",
    "basically , the baryon fraction is an increasing function with radius and tends towards an asymptotic value of @xmath197@xmath198 at large radius .",
    "such a variation has been noticed previously by a number of authors ( e.g. white & fabian 1995 ; david 1997 ; white et al . 1997 ) but not yet been satisfactorily accounted for in the framework of any prevailing models for cluster formation .    adopting a mean polytropic index of @xmath183 for the x - ray gas , we attempt to reproduce the observed radial variation of baryon fractions with our model .",
    "since the length scale of our model has already been fixed , the fitting can only be conducted in terms of the absolute value of baryon fractions .",
    "the best - fit curve to is illustrated in fig.7 .",
    "the significant rise of @xmath195 with radius from @xmath199 mpc outward is due to the fact that in this radial interval the dark matter profile goes as @xmath85 ( fig.1 ) whereas the gas distribution varies as @xmath200 ( fig.6c ) .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that the validity of our prediction about @xmath195 outside @xmath201 mpc begins to be questionable , though a decreasing tendency is seen to occur beyond @xmath116 mpc .",
    "finally , we have noted that the majority of the data for the baryon fractions @xmath195 have so far been derived from the isothermal gas hypothesis , for which an emission - weighted temperature over a finite x - ray emitting surface is applied .",
    "therefore , the comparison between our prediction with the measured baryon fractions holds true only statistically .",
    "in the present work , we explore the possibility of building up two distinct mass cores in a single galaxy cluster as a result of matter infall from the background hubble flow .",
    "comparisons of the predicted saturated configuration with observations reveal that our model agrees quite well with the lensing , galaxy distribution and gas distribution .",
    "our result is insensitive to the density parameter @xmath202 since the cluster builds up within a period much shorter than the age of the universe .",
    "the key assumptions of this model are ( a ) a pre - existing mass concentration , onto which the background matter falls , ( b ) the infall within the cluster is subsonic and the dark matter particles are largely virialized with ergodic orbits , in which situation the particle velocity dispersion is assumed to be a constant and ( c ) in the saturated phase the mass ratio of the two cores remains the same as that in the infall phase .    despite of its oversimplification ,",
    "the self - similar gravitational collapse of collisionless dark matter particles remains to be the only analytic approach to access the dynamical process of cluster formation , which may complement our understanding of its physical causes in addition to the employment of large - scale numerical simulations . in this paper",
    "we have re - addressed the self - similar infall model in a new way : our initial and boundary conditions are so chosen that there is a pre - existent mass concentration in the central position of cluster to induce mass accretion , and the process of major dark matter infall is confined within a finite interval of @xmath203 years .",
    "consequently , a hydrostatic equilibrium is established by now between the gravitational potential of dark matter and the galaxies / gas in the late evolutionary stage of clusters ( probably since redshift @xmath0 ) . in the scenario",
    "that the global properties of clusters remain not evolving , we have successfully reproduced the distributions of total mass , galaxies and hot gas in clusters of galaxies revealed by gravitational lensing and optical / x - ray observations .",
    "apart from the very central massive core of @xmath3 few @xmath204 within the radius of @xmath117 kpc ( adopting @xmath205 km s@xmath17 and @xmath128 mpc ) , the dark matter , galaxies and gas essentially share a common `` secondary '' core at @xmath206 mpc , though their profiles can differ significantly , depending on the radial variations of the velocity dispersion / thermal speed of galaxies / gas .",
    "we also find that the bias of the cluster averaged velocity dispersion of galaxies against the velocity dispersion of dark matter is indeed approximately unity , i.e. , @xmath207 , as expected from the virialization consideration that they are both within the same gravitational potential . in view of this result",
    ", it is further demanded that the specific dark matter kinetic energy and specific gas thermal energy to also be equal , i.e. , @xmath208 , thus yielding the @xmath191 parameter , which denotes the ratio of specific kinetic energy in galaxy to that in gas , to be also approximately unity ( bahcall & lubin 1994 ; girardi et al .",
    "the resulting x - ray surface brightness is found to be well fit by the conventional @xmath6-model , with , however , the parameter @xmath191 different from the @xmath180 parameter used in the @xmath6-model fitting of the x - ray surface brightness . the mean value of @xmath180 turns out to be @xmath209 , in contrast to @xmath210 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath6 discrepancy , @xmath211 , arises , in our model , as a natural consequence of the polytropic index of gas @xmath212 . with the mean value @xmath209",
    ", it yields that the mean value of @xmath165 should be @xmath213 .",
    "apparently , the present model has its own problems that remain to be resolved in the future .",
    "first of all , it is unclear at what epoch the central massive core should begin to form ; this issue is relevant to the question as to when our model starts to be applicable .",
    "second , although optical / x - ray observations prefer a non - evolutionary scenario of galaxy clusters within @xmath0 , we are unaware of how the background matters should terminate the infall onto clusters .",
    "it is possible that after the cluster mass reached some threshold value the intercluster matters could then be heated up by the intracluster tidal forces exerted by clusters , thereby preventing further matter infall .",
    "how this heating mechanism may proceed remains to be examined .",
    "finally , the massive compact core is predicted to be about @xmath2 kpc in size .",
    "however , the current observations are unable to set any robust constraints on the matter distribution inside the core region as small as @xmath214 kpc .",
    "it requires future observations to confirm our prediction of compact cores at the cluster centers .",
