    "this optical emission is generally associated with extinction at a level compatible with the x - ray absorption ( e.g. , ferrarese & ford 1999 ) , suggesting that both the x - ray and optical emission are associated with the sub - kpc - scale radio jets ( hardcastle & worrall 2000 ) .",
    "it is unclear whether fri radio galaxies contain a dense torus of gas and dust of the type required by models which unify powerful radio sources ( barthel 1989 ) .",
    "cen  a and ngc  4261 are the clearest cases where column densities of order @xmath51 @xmath14 are required by the x - ray data ( kraft et al .  2003 , in preparation ; zezas et al .",
    "both objects are closer than ngc  315 , with the advantage that the nuclear emission is better separated from kpc - scale , radio - related , x - rays .",
    "however , m  87 is also nearby and does not require a heavily - absorbed component ( wilson & yang 2002 ) .",
    "even if central tori exist in fri radio galaxies , most of the x - ray emission may be associated with structures on larger scales , since there is at least one good case where the nucleus is known to be radiatively inefficient ( di matteo et al .",
    "little or no excess nuclear absorbing column would then be seen , except in cases ( such as ngc  4261 ) where the jets lie almost in the plane of the sky .",
    "if this is the case , the low x - ray column density of ngc 315 , whose jets may lie @xmath52 from the line of sight ( see  1 ) , says little about the presence or absence of a nuclear torus , although a second , heavily - absorbed , component might appear in a deeper x - ray observations .",
    "we have compared the pressure in the radio jet with that in the external x - ray emitting gas , assuming an equipartition magnetic field . at 10 arcsec from the core",
    "the fwhm of the radio jet is roughly 1.3 arcsec . using the radio flux density in a cylinder of length 1 arcsec ,",
    "modelling the electron spectrum above @xmath53 with a synchrotron spectrum consistent with the distribution of radio , x - ray , and optical ( upper limit ) flux densities over the surrounding 12-arcsec length of jet , assuming no relativistic protons , a filling factor of unity , no relativistic bulk motions , and a jet on the plane of the sky , we find a pressure of about @xmath54  pa , which is a reasonable match to the external pressure of @xmath55 pa ( table  [ tab : physxpars ] ) given the measurement and model uncertainties . such a model would be appropriate if the radio source is intrinsically one - sided . if at 10 arcsec from the core the jet is inclined at @xmath56 degrees to the line of sight , and has a bulk velocity of @xmath57 ( see  1 ) , then the bulk relativistic beaming factor , @xmath58 . the minimum pressure in the jet",
    "will now be reduced , by a factor of roughly @xmath59 ( bicknell 1994 ) , i.e. , to @xmath60  pa .",
    "projection effects mean that the jet is longer .",
    "the pressure in a @xmath28-model external atmosphere scales as @xmath61 at large distances from the core radius , i.e. , to give @xmath62 pa , such that a match between minimum jet pressure and external pressure can still be claimed given the uncertainties .",
    "pressure balance between the external medium and the minimum pressure in the jet at about 100 arcsec from the core ( on the reasonable assumption that the jet is now sufficiently slow that beaming can be ignored ) has previously been reported based on _ rosat _  pspc data by worrall & birkinshaw ( 2000 ) , who point out that  appears to be rather different from other b2 bright sample radio galaxies in remaining in pressure balance ( at minimum pressure ) over a large length of radio jet , without requiring an additional component of internal pressure .",
