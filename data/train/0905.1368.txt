    "various kinds of bubbling can occur : sphere bubbles in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath68 ; disk bubbles in @xmath57 , @xmath60 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 ; and a novel type of bubble which we call a _ figure eight bubble_. the latter is a triple of pseudoholomorphic maps",

    "these pictures are labeled in the pictorial language of @xcite : the maps @xmath86 form a `` quilt '' on the punctured @xmath87 , whose `` patches '' are the domains of the three maps ( labeled by the target spaces ) , and with  seams \" on the intersections of these domains ( labeled by the `` seam condition '' @xmath66 or @xmath70 that is satisfied there ) .",
    "we conjecture that the maps @xmath88 can be extended continuously to the closure of their domains in @xmath87 by a point @xmath89 .",
    "however , we can not in general prove this removal of singularities , nor is there a readily available fredholm theory for seams touching tangentially as in figure  [ figureeight ] .",
    "thus we are lacking the construction of a moduli space of figure eight bubbles . instead , as in @xcite we exclude bubbling by energy quantization without establishing a geometric description of the bubble .",
    "this method hinges on strict monotonicity with a nonnegative constant @xmath90 as well as the @xmath44-grading assumption .",
    "theorem  [ main ] has a wide range of applications : first , it provides a tool for symplectic topology , which has not yet been exhaustively used . in @xcite",
    "we give examples of elementary floer homology calculations arising from the representation of symplectic quotients as lagrangian correspondence .",
    "for example , a simple iteration in @xmath91 confirms the calculation @xmath92 of cho @xcite for the clifford torus in @xmath93 .",
    "we also show that non - displaceability of lagrangians in product symplectic manifolds follows directly if the lagrangian , viewed as correspondence , has an image in one of the factors whose floer homology is nonzero .",
    "this explains e.g.  the nondisplaceability of standard lagrangian embeddings @xmath94 ( for example the sphere @xmath95 ) by the fact that their projection to @xmath93 contains the nondisplaceable clifford torus .",
    "an application to non - triviality of symplectic mapping class groups is given in @xcite .",
    "second , our isomorphism is key to proving the topological invariance of various floer cohomology groups arising from decompositions in low - dimensional topology ; for example , the symplectic version of instanton ( knot ) homology constructed in @xcite , and seidel - smith homology and heegard - floer homology , for which it provides alternative constructions @xcite , @xcite . ] .",
    "third , from a more conceptual point of view , theorem  [ main ] is used in @xcite to give a solution to the problem in weinstein s construction that composition of lagrangian correspondences is not always defined . using the result here , one may construct a symplectic @xmath44-category , in which all lagrangian correspondences are composable morphisms and floer cohomology groups ( as @xmath44-morphism spaces ) are well defined .",
    "thus one removes the quotes in weinstein s  category \" by promoting the construction to a @xmath44-category , using floer theory .",
    "+ _ we thank paul seidel and ivan smith for encouragement and helpful discussions . _",
    "in this section we first explain why both floer cohomologies in theorem  [ main ] are well defined .",
    "then we give a specific  quilted \" setup and choice of perturbations for both that reduce the isomorphism of floer cohomologies to a bijection of moduli spaces that is proven in section  [ shrink ] .",
    "the significance of the monotonicity and maslov index assumptions in theorem  [ main ] is the following energy - index relation and relative grading .",
    "[ prop monotone ] suppose that the pair @xmath96 of lagrangians in @xmath97 is monotone , transverse , and has minimal annulus maslov index @xmath98 .",
    "( that is , @xmath99 is the positive generator of @xmath100 \\to m , v(s^1\\times\\{j\\})\\subset l_j\\}\\subset{\\mathbb{z}}$ ] . )",
    "then for any @xmath101 there exist constants @xmath102 and @xmath103 such that for all strips @xmath104\\to m$ ] with boundary values in @xmath96 and limits @xmath105 we have @xmath106 here @xmath107 is the energy and @xmath108 the linearized cauchy - riemann operator at @xmath109 .    given two strips @xmath110\\to m$ ] we can glue them together ( reversing the orientation of @xmath111 ) to an annulus @xmath38 \\to m$ ] , then @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "so the energy - index relation follows from monotonicity @xmath114 , and the index identity follows from @xmath115 .",
    "the energy - index relation ensures energy bounds for the moduli spaces of fixed index and thus compactness up to bubbling ( ` pointwise blow - up of the gradient ' ) and breaking of trajectories ( ` nontrivial amounts of energy moving off into both ends of the strip').-bounds on the holomorphic maps , before standard gromov compactness can be quoted .",
    "note that the domains of maps under our consideration are such that each interior point has bounded distance from a boundary point , where the maps take values in a compact lagrangian submanifold or in the projection of a compact lagrangian correspondence to one factor .",
    "hence it suffices to establish uniform bounds on the gradient ( i.e.  exclude bubbling ) . ] together with the index identity it excludes bubbling in moduli spaces of index less than @xmath99 as follows : any bubbling leads to a new ( possibly broken ) trajectory connecting the same points but with less energy.[multiblock footnote omitted ] by monotonicity , less energy means strictly less index . by the index identity mod @xmath99 that means negative index . by transversality ( previously established for moduli spaces of negative index ) that means an empty set : the new trajectory does nt exist , so the bubbling did nt happen .",
    "we spelled out this argument because we will use it again to exclude figure eight bubbling  by only proving energy loss , not actually giving a geometric description of the bubble .    working with",
    "@xmath116 there is just one point in the construction of floer cohomology where this argument fails : the @xmath117-dimensional moduli spaces of self - connecting floer trajectories have index @xmath44 , so bubbling could lead to an index @xmath118 solution ( which are always constant due to the @xmath119-action ) .",
    "assumption serves to exclude this scenario by index additivity arguments : any pseudoholomorphic disk bubble with boundary on @xmath120 will reduce the index by at least @xmath121 , the minimal maslov index on @xmath55 .",
    "so @xmath122 ensures that the remaining solution would have negative index ( and the same holds for sphere bubbles whose chern number would be at least @xmath123 ) .",
    "note that this argument , unlike the previous bubbling exclusion by energy loss , requires an identification of the bubbles as spheres and disks .",
    "( e.g.  exact lagrangians in a cotangent bundle have @xmath124 ) or use any other valid argument to prove @xmath125 . ] in our case it also requires that we work with a split almost complex structure ( preserving the factors of @xmath34 ) , otherwise pseudoholomorphic disks in the product manifold do nt necessarily have the minimal index of a disk in one of the factors .",
    "we will show in section  [ sec : qhf ] that we can achieve transversality with a split almost complex structure , and hence our assumptions indeed ensure that the floer cohomology @xmath126 is well defined .",
    "the next lemma shows that the floer cohomology @xmath127 for the composed lagrangian correspondence is also well defined .",
