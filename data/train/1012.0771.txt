    "notice that the type i and type ii rates differ .",
    "this difference is due to the interference between the pump beam and the outgoing modes , and between forward propagating modes and those which have been reflected from the crystal interfaces [ c.f .",
    "eqs .  , , , and ] .",
    "in fact , as one changes the crystal length the relative rates of type i and type ii change , with some lengths resulting in a larger type ii rate compared to type i. one also observes the appearance of beat frequencies in the count rate as the crystal length is changed ( see fig .  [ beats ] ) .",
    "these are also caused by interference of the modes within the crystal .",
    "note also that a longer crystal length leads to a larger distance over which linear absorption can act , hence the general reduction in the count rate with increasing crystal length .",
    "let us comment on a few observations .",
    "firstly , owing to the dyadic structure of the green tensor , the detected modes and the modes created at the interaction point decouple .",
    "thus , the count rate of a specific polarization state is a function of both possible polarization states [ c.f .",
    "eqs .   and ] .",
    "this highlights a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics that , until measured , the signal and idler modes propagate as a superposition of both possible polarization states .",
    "another observation is that the contributions to the count rate from each of the detected polarization states are equal [ c.f .",
    "eqs .   and ] .",
    "it is easy to show that , despite absorption , this is a maximally entangled state with respect to polarization .",
    "in fact , since the outgoing modes propagate as both polarization states , even with a more complicated material , ( e.g birefringence , frequency dependent absorption , etc . ) the detected state will still be maximally entangled .",
    "similar arguments can be used show that the hong - ou - mandel interference pattern from two - photon interference is unaffected and it is still possible to get maximal visibility despite absorption . it is important to note that this analysis has described a experimental setup that post - selects the two photon state .",
    "it is possible that during the propagation through the crystal one photon of the down - converted pair is absorbed and lost completely .",
    "however , these states are not detected in coincident counting experiments and hence do not affect the results outlined above .",
    "in this article we have investigated the coincident count rates for type i and type ii parametric down - conversion , subject to absorption . despite initial assumptions to the contrary",
    ", we found that the increase in rate that is caused by the extra nonlinear interactions of the electric field with the noise polarization field are negligible compared to the effect of linear absorption .",
    "thus we have conclusively shown that nonlinear absorption and nonlinear noise interactions can be safely neglected in all current experimental work .",
    "we also found that the rates for type i and type ii conversion differ . aside from the possibility of differing nonlinear susceptibilities the two types of conversion , they also differ owing to the different interference processes that occur between the waves that scattered from the crystal boundaries .",
    "we also observe that , in spite of absorption , the entanglement and two - photon interference properties of the photon pairs are unchanged by both the extra nonlinear noise interactions and by linear absorption if one assumes that both photons are detected . however",
    ", absorption will play an important role in single photon counting experiments where one only detects one of the photons in the pair . unlike in coincident counting experiments , where the loss of one photon means that the photon pair is undetected , in the case of single photon counting these partially absorbed photon pairs will contribute significantly to the count rate .",
    "hence , in single photon counting experiments both linear absorption and nonlinear noise interactions will play a more important role .",
