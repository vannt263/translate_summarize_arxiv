    "the equation of state ( [ vdw - p - n ] ) was suggested by van der waals ( vdw ) in 1873 , and for his work he obtained the nobel prize in physics in 1910 . in the present paper",
    "the vdw equation ( [ vdw - p - n ] ) will be transformed to the gce .",
    "the gce formulation will be then used to calculate the particle number fluctuations in the vdw gas .",
    "normally , the gce is an easiest one from the technical point of view .",
    "thus , it is used more frequently , and a typical problem in statistical mechanics is to transform the gce results to the ce ones . however , the pressure functions of the ev ( [ ev - p - n ] ) and vdw ( [ vdw - p - n ] ) have their simplest and transparent forms just in the ce .",
    "a comparison of a simple analytical form ( [ ev - p - n ] ) with a transcendental equation ( [ ev - p - mu ] ) elucidates this point . on the other hand , the ce pressure does not give a complete thermodynamical description of the system .",

    "variables for the pressure function .",
    "does one really need the gce formulation for the statistical description of hadrons ? there are at least three reasons for a positive answer to this question .",
    "first , the ce pressure , e.g. , eq .  ( [ ev - p - n ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ vdw - p - n ] ) , does not give any information concerning the particle mass @xmath14 and degeneracy factor @xmath15 .",
    "however , the average energy of the system depends on the value of @xmath14 , e.g. , the thermal part of energy per particle equals to @xmath16 at @xmath17 , and to @xmath18 at @xmath19 .",
    "second , the number of hadrons of a given type is usually not conserved .",
    "for example , the number of pions can not be considered as an independent variable and is a function of volume and temperature .",
    "the gce formulation of the vdw equation can be therefore an important step for inserting the repulsive and attractive vdw interactions into the multi - component hadron gas .",
    "third , eqs .",
    "( [ ev - p - n ] ) and ( [ vdw - p - n ] ) of the ce give no answer about the particle number fluctuations .",
    "formally , the number of particles does not fluctuate in the ce : the total number of particles @xmath20 is constant in the full volume @xmath21 .",
    "however , the number of particles @xmath3 starts to fluctuate if one considers a sub - system with @xmath22 . if @xmath23 the @xmath3-fluctuations should follow the gce results . for the ev model",

    "the vdw pressure function ( [ vdw - p - n ] ) has the simple and familiar form in the ce . however , there are some reasons for its reformulation in the gce .",
    "first of all , the ce pressure does not give a complete thermodynamical description of the system .",
    "besides , the gce has clear advantages if one will try to extend the vdw model to multi - component hadron gas .",
    "the gce formulation is also necessary to find the particle number fluctuations in the vdw gas .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the procedure of a transformation of the ce pressure function to the gce equation of state .",
    "this procedure has a form of the first order differential equation for the free energy @xmath34 as a function of @xmath0 . a general solution of this equation includes the boundary condition at @xmath47 which is taken in the form of the ideal gas free energy in the limit of @xmath48 .",
    "this adds to the gce formulation an information of the particle masses and degeneracy factors which was absent in the ce pressure function . following this procedure",
    "we transform the ce vdw pressure ( [ vdw - p - n ] ) to the transcendental equation ( [ nvdw ] ) for the particle number density in the gce .",
    "other thermodynamical functions of the vdw gas in the gce can be then obtained in a unique way .",
    "the particle number fluctuations are calculated for the vdw gas in the gce formulation .",
    "an analytical expression for the scaled variance of particle number fluctuations is derived in terms of dimensionless particle number density @xmath182 and temperature @xmath183 .",
    "it clearly demonstrates that in the vdw gas the repulsive interactions suppress the particle number fluctuations , whereas the attractive interactions lead to their enhancement . in the pure phases far away from the critical point the particle number fluctuations approach to those of the ideal gas , i.e. , @xmath133\\cong 1 $ ] , at @xmath184 , and becomes small , @xmath133\\ll 1 $ ] , at @xmath137 .",
    "the scaled variance @xmath133 $ ] increases in a vicinity of the critical point and diverges at the the critical point @xmath185 .",
    "admitting a presence of metastable states , one observes that the scaled variance @xmath133 $ ] diverges also at the boundary between the metastable and unstable regions , where @xmath144 .    the fluctuations of partial volumes @xmath186 and @xmath187 occupied by the gaseous and liquid components have influence on the particle number fluctuations in the mixed phase .",
    "however , the particle number fluctuations remain finite in the mixed phase . they start to increase in a vicinity of the critical point and diverge at the critical point reached from inside the mixed phase .",
    "we hope that the present study of the vdw equation of state within the gce formulation can be useful for several applications in hadron physics .",
    "in particular , it looks promising to consider the nuclear matter with the vdw equation of state corrected by the fermi statistics effects .",
