    "the _ swift _ gamma - ray burst explorer @xcite has been returning unprecedented data about gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) for the past 18 months . of particular interest in the bursts followed by _",
    "swift _ have been the early time lightcurves of the afterglows which have shown much greater structure and different temporal decay properties than expected , leading to much discussion in the literature regarding the nature of the transition between the prompt emission , thought to be due to synchrotron radiation from internal collisions @xcite , and the afterglow , also thought to be due to synchrotron radiation , though it remains somewhat unclear whether the emission arises in internal or external shocks . _ swift _ observations have shown that grb lightcurves can be described by a canonical 3-segment shape .",
    "this shape consists of 1 - an early steep decay phase ( f@xmath2 where 3@xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath3 5 ; t @xmath5 500  s ) 2 - a very shallow decay phase ( 0.5 @xmath3 @xmath6 @xmath3 1.0 ; 500  s @xmath5 t @xmath5 @xmath7  s ) and 3 - a normal decay phase ( 1 @xmath3 @xmath8 @xmath3 1.5 ; @xmath7  s @xmath5 t ) @xcite .",
    "superimposed on this smooth decay profile , _ swift _ has shown that bright x - ray flares , 2 to 100 times as bright as the underlying afterglow , are common during the early ( t @xmath3 10  ks ) stages of grbs @xcite .",
    "the observation of grb050117 @xcite marked the first time that _ swift _ slewed to and settled on a grb while the prompt gamma ray emission was still in progress , arriving 192 seconds after the burst alert telescope ( bat ) triggered on the burst which had a t@xmath9 of 168 seconds .",
    "due to irregularities in the observing mode of the xrt and the proximity of the south atlantic anomaly to _ swift _ during the observation of grb050117 , however , only very sparse data was collected by the xrt , totaling 11.4 seconds in the first orbit and 946 seconds overall .",
    "this left large gaps in the lightcurve coverage and severely limited the quality of the spectral analysis that could be performed .",
    "we report here on the observation of grb  050713a @xcite , a burst of t@xmath9 = 70 seconds to which _ swift _ slewed and began collecting data with the narrow field instruments ( nfis ) in just 72.6 seconds , while the prompt gamma ray emission was still detectable by the bat .",
    "this burst marks just the second time that the bat and xrt have collected simultaneous data on a burst and it marks the first time that both instruments have produced a well sampled , simultaneous dataset covering multiple flares in the prompt emission .",
    "in addition to the _ swift _ coverage of grb  050713a , we report also on prompt and followup observations carried out by konus - wind , magic , _ xmm - newton _ and ground based optical observatories . in section 2 we describe the observations and data analysis from all instruments including ground follow - up . in section 3",
    "we discuss the implications of the observations in light of the new theoretical understanding emerging from _ swift _ observations of grbs . in section 4",

    "many different observatories and instruments have observed grb  050713a .",

    "t@xmath9 measured in the 15350  kev energy range is @xmath14  s @xcite .",
    "the onset of the burst as defined by the bat trigger is preceded by a weak , hard ( photon index = 1.26 ) precursor at t@xmath060  s. bat data were processed using the bat ground software build 11 and bat calibration database files build 11 .    at the time of the bat trigger",
    ", the flux rose rapidly and remained elevated during a 12  s long , multipeaked burst ( fig 1 ) . at t@xmath0 + 12",
    "s , the bat flux rapidly decayed with a powerlaw decay rate of @xmath15 for 5 seconds before breaking to a more shallow decay of @xmath16 at t@xmath0 + 17  s. this decay continued until t@xmath0 + 40  s at which point the bat flux had decayed to near background levels . at t@xmath0 + 50",
    "s , a flare is seen with peak flux @xmath17  ergs  @xmath12  s@xmath13 , extrapolated into the xrt 0.210.0  kev bandpass , followed by a flare with peak flux @xmath18  ergs  @xmath12  s@xmath13 at t@xmath0 + 65  s , another at t@xmath0 + 105  s with peak flux @xmath19  ergs  @xmath12  s@xmath13 and some hint of further emission at the onset of a flare seen in the xrt at t@xmath0 + 160  s. a weak but statistically significant precursor is seen at t@xmath070  s to t@xmath050  s followed by a period of no significant emission from t@xmath050  s to the burst trigger .",
    "the spectrum of the entire bat dataset is well fit by a power - law spectrum with photon index =  @xmath20 , though there is evidence for a slightly harder index of 1.45 during the plateau and a softening to @xmath21 during the rapid decay , and further softening to @xmath22 during the weak flares . using the global fit of @xmath23 ,",

    "correcting for this factor , one sees that the k - w trigger time corresponds to t@xmath0 + 0.742  s. prior to t@xmath0(k - w)-0.512  s data were collected by k - w in a survey mode with lower time resolution of 2.944  s and only 3 broad spectral channels , 1870  kev , 70300  kev and 3001160  kev . from t@xmath0(k - w ) to t@xmath0(k - w)+491.776  s , 64 spectra in 101 channels were accumulated on time scales varying from 64 ms near the trigger to 8.19  s by the time the signal became undetectable .",
    "the multichannel spectra cover the 18  kev14  mev energy range but no statistically significant emission is seen above  2  mev .",
    "data were processed using standard konus - wind analysis tools .",
    "joint spectral analysis was carried out using the bat data between 15 and 150  kev and the konus data from 20 to 2000  kev .",
    "the spectra were fit by a power law model with an exponential cut off : dn / de @xmath26 e@xmath27 e@xmath28 where e@xmath29 is the peak energy of the @xmath30 f@xmath31 spectrum and @xmath32 is the photon index .",

    "the xrt @xcite performs an automated sequence of observations @xcite after _ swift _ slews to a grb detected by the bat .",
    "when the spacecraft first settles on the target , a short image ( 0.1  s followed by a longer 2.5  s image if a position is not determined in 0.1  s ) is taken to determine an accurate position .",
    "following the image , the xrt switches into either windowed timing ( wt ) mode ( a high timing accuracy mode with 1 dimensional position information ) if the source count rate is above 2 counts s@xmath13 , or photon counting ( pc ) mode ( the more traditional operating mode of x - ray ccds in which full 2 dimensional position information is retained but with only 2.5  s timing resolution ) if the count rate is below 2 counts s@xmath13 .",
    "xrt collected a 0.1  s image mode frame upon settling on grb  050713a 73 seconds after the bat trigger , which yields a count rate of 314 counts s@xmath13 . following the image mode frame ,",
    "xrt cascaded down through its automated mode sequence and collected its first wt frame 4.5 seconds later . at the onset of the wt data , the xrt count rate was about 100 counts s@xmath13 and decaying as a powerlaw .",
    "this initial powerlaw decay in the xrt wt data together with the image mode data point measured at a flux level @xmath13 times higher just 4.6  s earlier clearly indicates that the xrt settled and began taking data during the latter portion of the flare detected in the bat at t@xmath0 + 65 seconds ( see fig 4 ) .",
    "xrt remained in wt mode throughout the entire first orbit of data collection on grb  050713a , also observing the flare detected by the bat at t@xmath0 + 105 and a lower level flare not clearly detected by the bat at t@xmath0 + 155  s.    following a 65 minute period of occultation by the earth , xrt began observations again at t@xmath0 + 4300  s , now observing in pc mode since the countrate of the source had decayed below 2 counts s@xmath13 . a small flare at t@xmath0 + 10  ks and the indication of another flare at t@xmath0 + 45",

    "an x - ray image compiled from the first segment of xrt pc data is shown as figure 5 with the bat , xrt and optical counterpart error circles displayed .",
    "a faint background source is detected 30 arcseconds due south of the grb afterglow at a constant flux level of @xmath43 counts s@xmath13 .",
    "the contribution of this steady source has been removed from the calculation of the afterglow lightcurve .",
    "a timeline of the xrt ( as well as other ) observations of grb  050713a is shown in table 1 .",
    "the lightcurve will be broadly treated in two parts .",
    "the first part is the initial orbit of data , during which the lightcurve is characterized by bright flares which are simultaneously observed by the bat as well as the k - w instrument at higher energies . due to the extreme variability in this portion of the lightcurve , a global decay index",
    "can not be determined from the xrt data .",
    "the second part is the remainder of the xrt data from the second orbit onward , which is characterized primarily by a broken powerlaw decay , though at least one small flare is seen superimposed atop this global decay .",
    "_ swift _ finished slewing to grb  050713a at t@xmath0 + 73  s , during the flare which began at t@xmath0 + 65  s. the xrt short image frame is collected just after the peak of this flare , at a flux of @xmath44ergs  @xmath12  s@xmath13 , and the first 20 frames of wt data record the decay of the flare . fitting a simple powerlaw to this decay from t@xmath0 + 79  s to t@xmath0 + 100  s setting t@xmath0 to be the bat burst trigger time , we find a powerlaw index of @xmath45 ( 1 @xmath46 ) . at t@xmath0 + 105",
    "s a new flare begins , which rises with a powerlaw index of @xmath47 for 5 - 10  s , flattens at the peak of @xmath48 ergs  @xmath12  s@xmath13 for 5 - 10  s , then decays with a more shallow powerlaw index of @xmath49 for about 30  s. at t@xmath0 + 165  s a third flare is detected , which rises with a powerlaw slope of @xmath50 for 5 - 10  s , flattens at the peak of @xmath51 ergs  @xmath12  s@xmath13 for 5 - 10  s , then decays with a slope of @xmath52 for 70  s before the end of the observing window due to earth occultation .",
    "the second orbit of data in the xrt is the only single orbit of data in which the afterglow is characterized by a well sampled ( greater than 100 events total ) lightcurve devoid of any obvious flaring activity . during the 1600 seconds of data in this orbit , from t@xmath0 + 4360",
    "s to t@xmath0 + 5952  s , the lightcurve decays steadily as a powerlaw with decay index of about 1.0 .",
    "the third orbit of data is characterized by another flare , beginning at t@xmath0 + 10  ks , lasting throughout the entire orbit ( about 2  ks ) and reaching a peak flux of @xmath53 ergs  @xmath12  s@xmath13 .",
    "a powerlaw fit to the rising portion of the flare yields a slope of @xmath54 while the decaying portion yields a slope of @xmath55 .",
    "this flare seems to be superposed atop the underlying afterglow decay of decay index @xmath56 .",
    "observations were interrupted after 150  s during the fourth orbit due to the occurrence of grb  050713b , and observations of grb  050713a remained suspended until t@xmath0 + 40  ks .",
    "some suggestion of another flare is seen in the orbit of data beginning at t@xmath0 + 45  ks , though the statistics are poor . while afterglow data from the xrt alone do not clearly require a break in the afterglow powerlaw , _ xmm - newton _ data ( see @xmath572.4 ) from t@xmath0 + 21  ks to t@xmath0 + 50  ks provide an accurate measure of the late - time decay slope ( @xmath58 ) which can not fit the xrt data from orbits 2 and 3 without a break in the powerlaw .",
    "the joint xrt-_xmm - newton _ lightcurve will be further discussed in @xmath572.4 .",
    "table 2 summarizes the flares and their temporal fits .      the xrt spectral analysis of this burst is somewhat complicated by the high degree of flaring activity seen . in all cases , spectra are binned to a minimum of 20 counts per bin in order to use @xmath35 statistics .",
    "fitting the entire first orbit of data , the spectrum is well fit by a highly absorbed powerlaw with photon index @xmath59 and @xmath60  @xmath12 , which is significantly above the galactic column ( @xmath61  @xmath12 ) in the direction of grb  050713a .",
    "we are also able , due to the large number of counts in each of the early flares in the dataset , to fit a spectrum to both the rising and decaying portions of the flares . in doing",
    "so we see the typical hard to soft evolution of the flares @xcite .",
    "the second orbit of data shows a significantly different spectrum from the first , with a harder spectrum with photon index @xmath62 and a lower value of @xmath63 , possibly indicating a period of energy injection @xcite .",
    "the third orbit is well fit by a softer powerlaw similar to that which fit the first orbit with photon index @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    during the period of overlapping coverage between _ swift _ and _ xmm - newton _ , xrt has 3.5  ks of exposure time at a mean countrate of 0.04 counts s@xmath13 for a total of about 150 events during the simultaneous observing period .",
    "fitting a spectrum to this overlapping coverage yields a photon index @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the corresponding mean unabsorbed 0.210.0  kev flux during the overlap period as measured by xrt is @xmath68 ergs @xmath12  s@xmath13 .    the data collected after the third orbit ( i.e. , after the temporal break in the lightcurve at t@xmath0+@xmath69  ks ) are too sparse to justify fitting with higher order models , but a simple absorbed powerlaw fit yields a spectrum of photon index @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "this is consistent with the x - ray photon index found in orbits 1 and 3 and is marginally softer than the photon index found during orbit 2 which , as noted above , suggests a period of energy injection .",

    "all three epic cameras ( pn and 2 mos ) were used in full window mode with the medium filter in place .",
    "source spectra and lightcurves for all 3 epic cameras were extracted from circular regions of 20 arcseconds radius centered on the afterglow .",
    "background data were taken from a 60 arcseconds circle on the same chip as the afterglow , but free of any x - ray sources .",
    "fitting the afterglow lightcurve with a simple power - law decay results in a decay index of @xmath72 .",
    "several flares are present in the background lightcurve , so as a conservative check , we also excluded times where the background rate is @xmath73countss@xmath13 .",
    "the afterglow decay rate is then @xmath74 , consistent with the above value .",
    "the decay rate from the mos lightcurve ( for the two detectors combined ) is also consistent at @xmath75 .",

    "source spectra were binned to a minimum of 20 counts per bin in order to use @xmath76 statistics .",
    "the pn and mos spectra were fitted jointly , allowing only the cross normalization to vary between the detectors , which is consistent within @xmath77 .",
    "the two mos spectra and responses were combined to maximize the signal to noise , after first checking that they were consistent with each other .",

    "the detection by k - w of the precursor but not the later flares is indicative of the harder spectral index seen in the precursor as compared to the later flares ( see section 3.3 for discussion of separate spectral fits to individual flares ) .",

    "support for this notion of the presence of an energy injection phase may be drawn from the harder x - ray spectral slope of the second orbit of xrt data ( photon index = 1.9 @xmath102 0.13 ) compared to the first orbit ( photon index = 2.28 @xmath102 0.04 ) , the third orbit ( photon index = 2.25 @xmath102 0.23 ) , and the later data ( photon index = 2.8 @xmath102 0.6 ) ( table 5 ) .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ data coverage nicely fills much of the data gap in the xrt coverage between t@xmath0 + 15  ks and t@xmath0 + 40  ks and provides high signal to noise data in this regime , producing a confident determination of the lightcurve break .",
    "the global picture of the lightcurve of this burst is one in which the early data ( prior to t@xmath0 + 12  s ) shows a bright plateau in the 15  kev to 1  mev energy range , consisting of multiple overlapping peaks . at t@xmath0 + 12",
    "s the emission drops rapidly , consistent with a curvature radiation falloff @xcite until subsequent flaring activity begins to be seen in the 0.3150  kev region with some indication of flux at higher energies from k - w . due to the rapid rise and decay of the flares , internal shocks from continued central engine activity appears to be the most likely explanation for these flares @xcite . the earliest ground based optical detections are reported at this time also , suggesting that the flares may also be optically bright .",
    "the lack of higher resolution timing information in the optical data , though , admits the possibility that the optical emission may be unassociated with the emission mechanism responsible for the x - ray flares .",
    "it is possible that the optical emission is due to synchrotron emission from the reverse shock ( rs ) , though the much higher flux level of the x - ray flare peaks compared to the optical measurements suggests that the x - ray flares themselves are not due to inverse compton scattering of the optical synchrotron emission of the rs @xcite .",
    "following this prompt emission phase , an energy injection phase begins which dominates the lightcurve until at least t@xmath0 + 16  ks . during the energy injection phase ,",
    "continued activity of the central engine adds energy to the afterglow of the burst , either through additional ejection events or through the realization of energy contained in previously ejected outward moving relativistic shells which only collide at later times , producing late time internal shock emission which is then added to the overall decay @xcite .",
    "it may be expected , if the energy injection phase is due to continued central engine activity , that flaring behavior would continue to be observed during this period and , indeed , some evidence for small scale flaring activity during both the second and third orbit of xrt data can be seen , though at a much reduced significance in comparison to the flaring activity of the first orbit . near t@xmath0 + 25  ks , the energy injection phase ends , giving way to a steeper decay slope similar to what is often seen in grbs after the prompt emission phase and prior to the possible onset of a traditional jet - break @xcite .",
    "many flares superimposed on top of the overall decay of grb  050713a show the typical properties seen in other bursts : that @xmath107t / t @xmath1 0.1 and that the peak flux level is negatively correlated with the time of the flare @xcite .",
    "these two properties of flares seen in _ swift _ grb afterglows have been cited as evidence for flares being produced through accretion processes onto the central compact object @xcite , but we offer here that the constancy of the @xmath107t / t value of flares may partly be a by - product of the overall decay of the afterglow in so much as the sensitivity of the xrt to flares is naturally degraded as the overall flux level of the afterglow decays , thus _ requiring _ flares at later times ( and hence , lower flux levels ) to be longer in duration for enough counts to be collected to produce a significant flare seen above the background . such a case can be seen in comparing the early time flares in the first orbit of grb  050713a to the flare seen in the the third orbit . during the first orbit , the underlying flux level beneath the flares",
    "is poorly determined , but can be assumed to be 10 - 100 counts s@xmath13 .",
    "we are dominated in this portion of the lightcurve by the poissonian error in the flux , which in a 10 second integration will be 10 - 32 counts , or 3 - 10@xmath108 .",
    "thus , for a flare to appear at the 6 sigma level above the background during this portion of the lightcurve , at most a 60@xmath108 increase in fluence above the normal powerlaw decay is needed , which can be acquired in a few seconds by the introduction of a flare with twice the flux of the underlying afterglow . during the third orbit , however , the underlying afterglow flux level has dropped to @xmath1 0.1 counts s@xmath13 . during a 10 second integration at 0.1 counts",
    "s@xmath13 the poisson error alone is 1 count , so for a flare to be detectable at 6 sigma above background at these count levels , the total fluence must be 6 counts , implying an increase in the rate from 0.1 counts s@xmath13 to 0.6 counts s@xmath13 during the 10  s interval , a 6 fold increase , which has been seen only in the brighter flares . in order to be sensitive to the same 60@xmath108 increase in flux level as during the first orbit , the flare which occurs at a flux level of 0.1 counts s@xmath13 needs to have a poission error which is 1/6 of the total counts in the observation ,",
    "i.e. , 36 counts must be collected , which implies an exposure time of at least 180  s if produced by the introduction of a flare with twice the flux of the underlying afterglow . in other words , because the afterglow flux level decays as t@xmath27 , the exposure time needed to acquire the same fluence level increases as t@xmath109 .",
    "thus , we see that in moving from the first orbit at t@xmath0 + 100  s to the third orbit at t@xmath0 + 10000  s , assuming a typical underlying powerlaw decay of the afterglow of @xmath110 1 , we have greatly decreased the temporal resolution of xrt to detect flares ( from a few seconds to a few hundred seconds ) .",
    "this is not to imply that there is not another more physical cause for the constancy of the @xmath107t / t ratio seen in flares , but rather to note that the typical grb seen by the _",
    "swift _ xrt does not provide sufficient flux at times typically greater than a few ks to detect the shorter timescale flares that are so often seen during the first orbit .",
    "in grb  050713a , a hint of emission above the afterglow powerlaw decay appears in the xrt data at t@xmath0 + 45  ks , though the statistics are , predictably , poor .",
    "this time is overlapped by _",
    "xmm - newton _ data , though , so we can look for evidence of a short flare in the _ xmm - newton _ data at this time . in figure 9",
    "we show the _ xmm - newton _ lightcurve , plotted linearly and zoomed near t@xmath0 + 45  ks . though a 1 - 2 sigma deviation above the background decay is seen at t@xmath0 + 45  ks , the _ xmm - newton _ data appear consistent with a statistical fluctuation rather than a true flare similar to those seen earlier during the burst .",
    "the presence of multiple flares in grb050713a argues against `` one - shot '' emission mechanisms such as synchrotron self - compton emission in a reverse shock or deceleration of the blastwave @xcite and it argues in favor of a mechanism which can produce repeated flares , such as late time central engine activity . while it may remain possible that one of the several flares in grb050713a is due to the rs or the onset of the afterglow due to external shocks , the steep temporal decays of all the temporally fitted flares coupled with the photon indices of the flares ( 1.25 @xmath1 2.5 ; table 6 ) do not satisfy the closure relations of sari et al . , (",
    "1998 ) , chevalier & li ( 1999 ) and sari et al . , ( 1999 ) for propagation of the blast wave into either a wind or constant density ism .",
    "together these points seem to argue in favor of an internal shock origin for the flares seen in this burst .      due to the relatively narrow spectral response function of the bat ( 15150  kev for mask - tagged events ) and the xrt ( 0.310  kev ) , a spectral fit to data from only one of the two high energy instruments on _ swift _ is usually not able to discriminate between higher order spectral models .",
    "analysts and authors are usually limited to choosing between a power - law or band function . in grb",
    "050713a we have a rare case of data coverage overlap between bat and xrt ( 0.3150  kev ) and also between bat and k - w ( 15  kev14  mev ) .",
    "taking advantage of this where appropriate , considering the relative flux levels in the three instruments , we have jointly fitted spectral datasets between the two pairs of instruments . during the precursor and from t@xmath0 + 0 to t@xmath0 + 16.5  s , we perform joint fitting between bat and k - w data . from t@xmath0",
    "+ 16.5 to t@xmath0 + 78  s we have only bat data . from t@xmath0 + 78 to t@xmath0 + 116  s and during the onset of the flare at t@xmath0 + 160 we perform joint fitting between xrt and bat .",
    "we have grouped the data into segments ( as shown in table 6 ) in order to temporally separate data which we expect may show significantly different spectral parameters .",
    "segments 1 - 4 contain bat and k - w data and are segmented to separate the precursor from the prompt emission and the prompt emission from the rapid decay phase .",
    "segment 5 contains bat data only and segments 6 - 10 contain xrt and bat data .",
    "these are segmented to distinguish the 3 flares which have overlapping data and also to separate the rise of each flare from the decay of each flare .",
    "we attempt fits to each of these segments using 4 different spectral models : 1 ) an absorbed powerlaw 2 ) an absorbed cutoff or broken powerlaw ( cutoff for data extending beyond 150  kev , broken otherwise ) 3 ) an absorbed band function and 4 ) an absorbed blackbody plus powerlaw .",
    "the precursor is the most poorly sampled of all the regions . despite the low number of counts in the region , a cutoff powerlaw is favored over a single powerlaw at @xmath111 confidence according to the f - test .",
    "of all the segments fit , the precursor has the hardest photon index , regardless of the model which is used to perform the fits .",
    "the plateau of the prompt emission is best fit by an exponentially cutoff powerlaw model with photon index @xmath112 and e@xmath113  kev .",
    "next to the precursor , the prompt plateau has the second hardest photon index of all segments fit , regardless of the model used .      as with the other data segments which contain k - w data , the rapid decay segment is poorly fit by a simple powerlaw and is best fit by a cutoff powerlaw or band function .",
    "the photon index of the cutoff powerlaw in segment 3 is quite similar to that in the prompt plateau , but the cutoff energy is somewhat lower ( 312  kev compared to 421  kev in the plateau ) , suggesting that the highest energy flux is `` shutting off '' during the rapid decay phase .",
    "this segment is an extension of the prompt segment to slightly later times , encompassing slightly more data .",
    "the cutoff powerlaw or band function is the best fit , with photon indices similar to segment 2 and e@xmath114 between that in segments 2 and 3 .",
    "this segment contains only bat data and is included for completeness , though the narrowness of the bat spectral response limits the ability to distinguish between models .",
    "a simple powerlaw is a good fit with photon index of 1.83 .",
    "is unconstrained .",
    "the powerlaw plus blackbody model produces a good fit to this segment but only with a very minimal blackbody component , effectively reproducing the fit of the simple absorbed powerlaw .",
    "therefore we consider the powerlaw plus blackbody model inapplicable to this segment .      only in this segment",
    ", the data time ranges are mismatched between xrt and bat ( due to xrt observations beginning towards the end of the flare decay ) . rather than",
    "ignore this flare or consider only the later part of the flare decay where xrt and bat data coverage overlap , we have chosen to fit the entire bat time range from t@xmath0 + 68 to t@xmath0 + 95  s together with the t@xmath0 + 79 to t@xmath0 + 95  s xrt data ( note that the image mode data taken at t@xmath0 + 73  s are highly piled up and can not be used spectrally ) for consistency with our treatment of the other flares . a simple powerlaw is a good fit to this segment , yielding @xmath115@xmath12 and a photon index of 2.47 , significantly softer than the rise of the flare , as expected .      in the rise of the brightest flare seen in xrt ,",
    "both an absorbed powerlaw plus blackbody model and an absorbed broken powerlaw model are significantly better fits ( f - test probability @xmath116 ) than a simple absorbed powerlaw .",
    "the powerlaw plus blackbody indicates @xmath117@xmath12 and a relatively soft photon index of 2.0 with a blackbody temperature of kt@xmath118  kev .",
    "we note that this value of kt is below the xrt energy band and may therefore indicate a non - physical spectral solution .",
    "the absorbed broken powerlaw indicates @xmath119@xmath12 and photon indices of @xmath120 and @xmath121 , broken at 3.4  kev .",
    "these two models are somewhat degenerate in this dataset , with both models producing a roll over in flux at low ( below 0.5  kev ) and high ( above 50  kev ) energies .",
    "the decay portion of this flare is well fit by a simple absorbed powerlaw with @xmath122@xmath12 and photon index of 2.68 .",
    "we note , however , that both an absorbed broken powerlaw and absorbed powerlaw plus blackbody are equally good fits to the data .",
    "the rise of the last flare with overlapping data is well fit by a simple absorbed powerlaw with @xmath123@xmath12 and photon index @xmath124 , however the absorbed powerlaw plus blackbody is , strictly , a better fit according to the f - test , though only at about the @xmath125 confidence level ( f - test probability = 0.219 ) , with @xmath126@xmath12 , kt=200  kev and photon index of 2.43 .",
    "we note that this value of kt is above the xrt - bat energy band and may therefore indicate a non - physical spectral solution .",
    "the decay of this flare is well fit by an absorbed powerlaw with @xmath127@xmath12 and photon index of 2.55 , though as with segment 9 , the absorbed powerlaw plus blackbody is also an acceptable fit with @xmath128@xmath12 , kt=5.2  kev and photon index of 2.83 .",
    "it should be noted that the bat flux is very near the noise level in this segment and really provides only an upper limit on the spectral fitting process in the higher energy region .",
    "we have produced the broadband sed ( spectral energy distribution ) of the afterglow of grb  050713a over the time range from t@xmath0 + 20  s to t@xmath0 + 1000  s ( fig 10 ) .",
    "this timerange includes detections of the burst afterglow in the optical from the raptor - s and liverpool telescopes ( corrected for the galactic extinction in this direction of @xmath129=1.04 @xcite ) and in the x - ray from _ swift _ bat and xrt .",
    "it also includes upper limits in the gamma - ray energy range from k - w ( whose detectable emission ends at t@xmath0+@xmath110  s ) and in the gev energy range from magic .",
    "a similar sed has been addressed by the magic collaboration in their paper regarding the magic flux upper limit @xcite in which they note that the sed composed of data from _ swift _ and magic ( 0.2  kev to 400gev ) is fit by a band function at low energy and that the magic data are consistent with a single unbroken powerlaw extending from e@xmath114 ( at @xmath1 400  kev ) to the magic limits up to 500  gev .",
    "we confirm this result , citing a best fit photon index for a single powerlaw fit from 400  kev to 500  gev of @xmath130 = 2.1 @xmath102 0.1 and a reduced @xmath131 = 1.66 for 63 dof .",
    "we further note that in performing our fit to the magic data , we have treated the magic upper limits as data points during our fit , thus our photon index or 2.1 is only a lower limit on the true photon index of a powerlaw which would fit the true flux level at gev energies .",
    "our results here are , therefore , consistent with the analysis of the albert et .",
    ", in which they show that their data are consistent with a powerlaw photon index of 2.5 from 400  kev to 500  gev .",
    "we add that a band function fit is not , however , consistent with the data when we also consider the contemporaneous optical detections .",
    "the relative faintness of the optical detections compared to the x - ray detections combined with the upper limits from k - w and magic requires an absorbed broken powerlaw fit .",
    "figure 10 shows the best fit to the entire sed using an absorbed powerlaw ( dotted ) , absorbed broken powerlaw ( solid ) and absorbed band function ( dashed ) .",
    "the spectral parameters and fit characteristics for each of these fits are shown in table 7 .",
    "we have not corrected for the attenuation of flux above 10gev due to photon - photon interactions with the infrared background @xcite , however , our spectral fit results will remain valid independent of this effect due to the constraints placed by the k - w limiting flux measurement from 20  kev to 14  mev .",
    "grb  050713a is one of the rare bursts observed simultaneously in soft x - rays ( xrt ) , hard x - rays ( bat ) and gamma - rays ( k - w ) .",
    "the broad spectral coverage of these simultaneous measurements has allowed us to fit the early prompt emission , rapid decay , and several flares in the early emission with several different spectral models . in general",
    "we find a cutoff powerlaw model to be a good fit to segments with data extending into the mev range , thus able to constrain the high energy component of the model .",
    "for data segments with 0.3150  kev coverage ( bat and xrt data ) we find that a simple absorbed powerlaw is often an adequate fit to the data , though an absorbed powerlaw plus blackbody or absorbed broken powerlaw model seems to sometimes be a marginally better fit during periods of flaring activity .",
    "the lightcurve structure of grb  050713a is quite typical of many grbs that have been observed by _",
    "it has an early section showing steep decay slopes of @xmath132 and bright flares extending until t@xmath0+@xmath11  ks , followed by a break to a flatter section with decay slope @xmath133 lasting until t@xmath0+@xmath125  ks , followed by a break to a steeper slope of @xmath58 .",
    "we have temporally separated the early , flaring portion of the burst into 10 segments and attempted to fit each segment using 4 different spectral models : 1 ) an absorbed powerlaw 2 ) an absorbed cutoff or broken powerlaw ( cutoff for data extending beyond 150  kev , broken otherwise )",
    "3 ) an absorbed band function and 4 ) an absorbed blackbody plus powerlaw . in all segments where at least two instruments provide significant , simultaneous levels of emission , and",
    "hence the spectral data span more than 2 decades in energy , we find that at least one of the higher order spectral models is acceptable and , in several cases , is a better fit to the data than a simple absorbed powerlaw .",
    "this suggests that the spectral shape of grb flares , while consistent with a simple absorbed powerlaw when viewed through any particular narrow spectral window , is intrinsically fit in the broadband by a model with attenuated flux above ( and possibly below ) some threshold energy .",
    "it has long been known that grb prompt emission is better fit by spectral models with a high ( and sometimes low ) energy cutoff than by a simple absorbed powerlaw @xcite , and thus the indication that grb flares are fit by a similar spectral model suggests that similar emission mechanisms may be responsible for the production of flares and for the prompt emission itself , namely internal shocks produced as a result of central engine activity . since the discovery of x - ray flares in grbs by _ swift _ ,",
    "relatively few of the flares have been observed simultaneously across a broad enough energy range to determine whether such higher order models are necessary to fit their spectra , making the multi - instrument observations of grb  050713a unique and valuable .",
    "we have also examined the temporal properties of the flares seen in grb  050713a as early as t@xmath0 + 80  s and as late as t@xmath0 + 10  ks . in all cases",
    "we find the flares to have steep powerlaw rise and decay slopes and 0.1 @xmath5 @xmath107t / t @xmath5 1 , which also suggests internal rather than external shocks as the production mechanism for the flares @xcite .",
    "we have noted that the presence of multiple flares and the failure of those flares to fit the closure relations associated with the external shock in a wind or constant density ism further argues in favor of the internal shock origin for the flares .",
    "we have furthermore discussed the difficulty that _ swift _ xrt will face in detecting late time flaring activity .",
    "we have noted that the xrt will have difficulty resolving late , short - timescale flares due to the low xrt count rates typically involved .",
    "data from higher throughput instruments such as _ xmm - newton _ _ epic _ will be important for constraining flares at these times",
    ". grb  050713a has simultaneous coverage at moderately late times with _ xmm - newton _ _ epic _ , but no conclusive evidence of flaring in the _ xmm - newton _ data has been found in this case .    finally , we have created a broadband sed of the flaring region of grb  050713a from 0.002  kev to 500gev at times from t@xmath0 + 20  s to t@xmath0 + 1000  s. we find that the sed is inconsistent with a single absorbed powerlaw or an absorbed band function and is best fit by an absorbed broken powerlaw .",
    "this overall sed again implies that grb flares are best fit by a spectral model similar to that of the prompt emission itself and thus suggests a common mechanism for the emission from the prompt phase and from flares .",

    "<S> simultaneous emission from two flares is detected in the bat and xrt . </S>",
    "<S> this burst marks just the second time that the bat and xrt have simultaneously detected emission from a burst and the first time that both instruments have produced a well sampled , simultaneous dataset covering multiple x - ray flares . the temporal rise and decay parameters of the flares are consistent with the internal shock mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the _ swift _ coverage of grb  050713a , we report on the konus - wind ( k - w ) detection of the prompt emission , an upper limiting gev measurement of the prompt emission made by the magic imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope and _ xmm - newton _ observations of the afterglow . simultaneous observations between _ swift _ xrt and _ xmm - newton _ produce consistent results , showing a break in the lightcurve at t@xmath0+@xmath115  ks . </S>",
    "<S> together , these four observatories provide unusually broad spectral coverage of the prompt emission and detailed x - ray follow - up of the afterglow for two weeks after the burst trigger . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneous spectral fits of k - w with bat and bat with xrt data indicate that an absorbed broken powerlaw is often a better fit to grb flares than a simple absorbed powerlaw . </S>",
    "<S> these spectral results together with the rapid temporal rise and decay of the flares suggest that flares are produced in internal shocks due to late time central engine activity . </S>"
