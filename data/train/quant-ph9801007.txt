    "distinguishing nonorthogonal quantum states at the minimum error is a fundamental problem in quantum communication .",
    "the optimum strategy minimizing the average error probability can be , in principle , derived from a linear optimization in terms of bayesian decision problem .",
    "such a strategy is generally represented by a probability operator measure ( pom ) which is a set of nonnegative hermitian operators @xmath0 satisfying the resolution of the identity @xcite , @xmath1 except for pure - state signals with a certain symmetry , it is tedious job to derive explicit expressions for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in addition , even when they can be obtained , corresponding physical processes are not necessarily obvious .",
    "mathematically , the optimum pom can be specified in the hilbert space of the minimum dimension that a set of signal states spans .",
    "however , it can often hardly be interpreted physically . for practical physical implementation",
    ", the pom should be constructed in a larger hilbert space which can fully describe the physical system making the signal states .",
    "such examples have been known only in the certain cases of binary signals @xcite . in the preceding paper ,",
    "the problem of decoding @xmath3-ary codeword states at the minimum average error probability was discussed . for attaining the minimum error , a _ collective decoding _ was essential in which each codeword state is detected as a single state - vector rather than detected as the individual letter states separately .",
    "it was shown that when it is applied to the properly selected codeword states , the _ quantum gain _ in transmittable information can be obtained .    in this paper , we present a physical scheme for the optimum collective decoding of @xmath3-ary codeword states , particularly , in the case that the letter states are pure and binary .",
    "this scheme consists of a quantum circuit and a simple separate measurement on the individual letter states . in the quantum circuit , a certain unitary transformation",
    "is carried out on the received codeword state and a superposition of the codeword states is generated .",
    "this unitary transformation is designed so that the minimum average error probability is attained when the output from the circuit is detected by the given separate measurement . in the following , the decoding scheme proposed in the preceding paper",
    "is briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , and then quantum circuit structures are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . in particular , a concrete model for distinguishing two codeword states of length 2 at the minimum average error will be proposed for an experimental demonstration of the principle of collective decoding .",
    "[ sec4 ] is for concluding remarks .",
    "let binary letter states be @xmath4 whose state overlap @xmath5 is assumed to be real . by concatenating them into block sequences of length @xmath6 , the @xmath7 possible sequences are made .",
    "we then pick up @xmath3-ary sequences as codeword states that are denoted as @xmath8 @xmath9 , and use them with input probabilities @xmath10 .",
    "the rest of sequences are denoted as @xmath11 . since the codeword states are linearly independent , they span the @xmath3-dim hilbert space @xmath12 .",
    "let the @xmath6-th extended hilbert space be @xmath13 .",
    "the optimum collective decoding is described by an orthonormal set @xmath14 on @xmath15 .",
    "this is achieved , in some cases , by the square - root measurement @xcite given by ,    @xmath16    [ eqn : sqrt - mu ]    let us define the gram matrix @xmath17 .",

    "so it is connected with the optimum measurement states @xmath21 via a unitary operator @xmath22 in @xmath15 as @xmath23 . a straightforward method to construct such a unitary operator",
    "is the bayes - cost - reduction algorithm proposed by helstrom @xcite . in this algorithm",
    ", one chooses a pair of codeword states @xmath24 , solves the binary decision problem in the plane spanned by the corresponding pair of measurement basis vectors @xmath25 , and get the revised basis vectors @xmath26 which can be connected with the previous ones via a @xmath27-operator @xmath28 in @xmath15 as ,    @xmath29    after revising the basis vectors , the average error probability will decrease or , at worst , remain the same .",
    "this kinds of steps are to be continued till reaching the optimum point . thus starting from the square - root measurement basis vectors ,",
    "the optimum ones are derived as , @xmath30    in order to consider a physical scheme , we make an orthonormal set @xmath31 on the whole space @xmath13 by adding the other basis vectors obtained by using the schmidt orthogonalization , @xmath32 we denote the expansion of all the sequences by the above basis vectors as ,    @xmath33    @xmath34    let @xmath35 be the measurement basis vectors distinguishing the individual letter states . by concatenating them into the block sequences of length @xmath6 , the @xmath7 product basis vectors in @xmath36 are made .",
    "we pick up @xmath3-ary basis vectors from them , and denote them as @xmath37 , and the rest of them as @xmath38 .",
    "all the sequences can be expanded alternatively by these basis vectors as ,    @xmath39    @xmath40    the two basis sets are connected via a unitary operator @xmath41 on the whole space @xmath13 as ,    @xmath42    where @xmath43 [ eqn : def_u ]    thus the optimum _ collective decoding _",

    "a model using a physically two - state system such as a two - level atom or a pair of single - mode photon polarizations is considered first , aiming at an experimental demonstration of the collective decoding .",
    "then , an implementation in the case of coherent - state signals is discussed .",
    "let @xmath54 be the upper - level and lower - level states of an atom , or two orthogonal linear polarization states of a single - mode optical field .",
    "the measurement basis vectors @xmath55 can then be taken naturally as @xmath54 representing a level detection or a linear polarizer .",

    "let us consider a simple case of distinguishing two codeword states @xmath62 , where @xmath63 means @xmath64 , etc .",
    "the two measurement basis vectors of the optimum collective decoding are given by ,    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the minimum bound of the average error probability .",

    "it is easy to see the optimum measurement basis vectors can be expressed as ,    @xmath77    where the unitary operator @xmath41 is defined by the following matrix representation in terms of the basis vectors @xmath78 , @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "thus the optimum collective decoding by @xmath81 has been decomposed into the unitary transformation by @xmath41 and the separate measurement by @xmath82 . as seen in eq .",

    "the controlled - not gate @xmath105 is obviously equivalent to @xmath106 .",
    "implementations of the 1-bit gates are straightforward by using the ramsey zone ( rz ) which is characterized by the hamiltonian , @xmath107 whose time evolution is described by the unitary operator , @xmath108 in the spinor representation , where @xmath109 is the pumping field amplitude , the angular frequency @xmath110 corresponds to an atomic level separation , and @xmath111 is an interaction period .",

    "the implementation of the 2-bit gate employs a microcavity and the ramsey zones .",
    "the atom - cavity field interaction is described by the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian , @xmath118 where @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) is an annihilation ( creation ) operator for the cavity field with the angular frequency @xmath121 , and @xmath122 is the coupling constant between the cavity field and the atom .",

    ", the decoder structure is quite parallel to the two - state atomic case by replacing the ramsey zone and the 2-bit gate with a polarizer and the quantum phase gate , respectively .",
    "so far , distinguishing codeword states at the minimum average error probability has never been done even for the simplest case @xmath62 .",
    "possible methods for it are not necessarily the above kind of scheme . as shown by brody and meister @xcite , the separate measurement together with the suitable feedback arrangement is capable of distinguishing the _ two _ codeword states at the minimum average error probability . for codeword states made of spin particles ,",
    "the generalized stern - gerlach measurement may effect the optimum collective decoding @xcite .",
    "as yet , however , it is strongly desired to demonstrate the scheme based on quantum circuits plus a simple standard measurement proposed in this paper because it seems the most natural and systematic method for designing a practical decoder .",
    "recently , the first experiment of distinguishing binary photon polarizations @xmath135 at the minimum average error probability @xmath136 was done by barnett and riis @xcite .",

    "the two 3-bit gates in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] can be further decomposed into circuits of the 2-bit gates as illustrated in fig .",
    "thus it is easy to see that the basic gates for our circuits are the 1-bit gates @xmath145 and @xmath146 , and the 2-bit gate @xmath102 .",
    "we would like to mention the case of binary phase - shift - keyed ( bpsk ) signals of optical coherent states @xmath147 .",
    "this signal system is the most basic keying in long distant and ultra fast coherent light communications .",
    "if the collective decoding for this case could be realized , it will give a great impact on communication technology .",
    "although the letter states are binary , the signal system is _ not _ a physically _ two - state _ system in this case . therefore in order to apply the above decoding scheme , a new class of gates must be invented .",
    "their specifications depend directly on what kind of measurement basis vectors are chosen as @xmath148 .",
    "let us consider the following example .",
    "we first transform the received codeword state by combining each field of the letter state , @xmath149 or @xmath150 , sequentially with a local oscillating field with very large intensity via a beam splitter having almost perfect transmittance .",
    "each process is represented by a unitary operator @xmath151 .",
    "the transformed codeword states consist of the new letter states @xmath152 .",
    "the optimum collective decoding is then performed for the transformed codeword states . in that decoding",
    "they undergo further the certain unitary transformation @xmath41 and are detected by the separate measurement that distinguishes each letter state @xmath153 or @xmath154 according to the measurement basis vectors @xmath155 or @xmath156 such as    @xmath157    the state",
    "@xmath156 only includes the fock states with finite photons .",
    "therefore this final measurement @xmath158 is equivalently accomplished by the photon counting @xmath159 .    the quantum circuit realizing the required unitary transformation @xmath41 should act on the qubits consisting of @xmath160 .",
    "in particular , the basic 2-bit gate @xmath102 is specified as , @xmath161 where @xmath162 represents a certain ancillary system .",
    "that is , depending on whether the control bit is the vacuum state or consists only of the finite - photon fock states , the target bit should remain unchanged or should be transformed into the superposition between @xmath153 and @xmath156 , respectively .",
    "it is an open question to find physical models accomplishing this function .",
    "as shown in the preceding paper , the collective decoding plays an essential role to realize true benefits of quantum communication .",
    "a systematic design of such a decoder becomes possible when techniques established in quantum computation are applied .",
    "the concrete scheme for the simplest collective decoding of @xmath62 at the minimum error rate was presented .",
    "it is implementable by use of the current cavity qed technique .",
    "experimental demonstration is strongly desired .",
    "further it is a challenging task to demonstrate experimentally the information theoretic quantum gain @xmath163 which must be seen for the codeword states @xmath164 .",
    "the amount of gain is quantitatively small but it will become measurable by increasing numbers of trial of transmission . from a practical view point of coherent light communication , the problem was addressed on an implementation of a new class of gates that can act on the binary coherent states .",
