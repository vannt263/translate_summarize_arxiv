    "high - resolution interferometer observations were obtained by using the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) in the c configuration on 1994 december 2 and in the d configuration on 1995 march 16 .",
    "flux and phase calibrations were performed by observing the nearby radio source 3c 273 , which had a flux density of 22 jy at the observing frequency . a 1024-channel fx system ( a fast - fourier - transform spectro - correlator )",
    "was used for spectroscopic data acquisition with a total bandwidth of 320 mhz ( 831 ) .",
    "the data were then averaged in 16 bins of the original frequency channels , resulting in 64 channels with a frequency ( velocity ) resolution of 5 mhz ( 13.0 ) .",
    "the cleaned maps were then combined into a cube of intensity data in the ( ra , dec , ) space . using the data cube",
    ", we obtained an intensity map , velocity field map , and position - velocity diagrams along the major axis .",
    "the synthesized beam was @xmath31 , which yielded a brightness temperature - to - flux density ratio of 1.725 k/(jy / beam ) .",
    "the observational parameters are summarized in table 1 .",
    "ccd optical observations were made using a cassegrain spectrometer equipped on a 188-cm reflector at the okayama astrophysical observatory .",
    "the slit width was @xmath32 , which is similar to the seeing size , and was put crossing the nucleus at a position angle of 66 .",
    "the ccd chip had @xmath33 pixels ; we have averaged values in every 2 pixels in spatial direction to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , resulting in @xmath34 per pixel , and the spectral dispersion was 0.767 (velocity spacing of 34.9 ) per pixel .",
    "taking into account the seeing size , pixel binding , and the tracking error during observations , we estimate the spatial resolution to be about @xmath35 . taking into account the slit width ,",
    "the effective spectral resolution was 1.92  , which corresponds to a velocity resolution of 87.1 .",
    "we finally used 160 pixels ( @xmath36 ) in the spatial direction , and 270 pixels of wavelength range of 207   including the and  line emissions .",
    "the exposure time was 1000 sec per one spectrum , and we took three spectra for the galaxy and combined them .    the continuum emission , such as that due to the bulge , has been subtracted by applying a background - filtering technique ( sofue and reich 1979 ) .",
    "we first smoothed the original spectrum s@xmath37 in the wavelength direction by a convolution function of width @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the position in pixel along the major axis and @xmath40 the pixels in the wavelength direction .",
    "the convoluted spectrum s@xmath41 was subtracted from the original to get s@xmath42 : @xmath43 .",
    "the negative values in s@xmath42 was replaced with 0 , and s@xmath42 is subtracted from the original to get @xmath44 .",
    "we smooth s@xmath45 by the same convolution function , and obtained s@xmath46 .",
    "then , we replaced s@xmath41 with s@xmath46 , and applied again the above procedure , and repeated this procedure for several times .",
    "we finally obtained a ` background ( continuum)'-subtracted spectrum , @xmath47 .",
    "the spurious lines from the atmosphere , which are at the rest wavelengths , are also subtracted from the spectrum .",

    "figure 2 shows the obtained distribution of the integrated co - line intensity .",
    "the molecular - gas distribution is elongated in the direction of the position angle of 80 , about 14  shifted from the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "the gas distribution comprises two large clumps , and is highly asymmetric with respect to the center : the western clump is much brighter than the eastern one .",
    "the peak intensity of @xmath49 jy / beam = 193 k  is obtained at ra=12h31m34.52s , dec=@xmath50 .",
    "an arm - like feature is extending toward the east from the eastern clump , coinciding with an optical spiral arm . a counter part to this arm appears to be present in the western side .     fig . 1      fig .",
    "2     the total co luminosity integrated within @xmath51 area centered on the map center is estimated to be @xmath52 k  pc@xmath17 for an assumed distance of @xmath53 mpc .",
    "this yields a mass of molecular hydrogen gas of @xmath54 ; the total mass of molecular gas is given by @xmath55 for @xmath22 . here",
    ", the correction factor @xmath56 from the hydrogen mass to real gas mass , including he and heavier elements , was taken from sofue ( 1995 ) for the milky way center , and the conversion factor at the center of a galaxy , @xmath57 h@xmath42 / k , was taken from arimoto et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the dynamical mass @xmath58 can be estimated from the rotation curve , as obtained in the next section .",
    "the dynamical mass within 1 kpc radius , where the major co features are included , is estimated to be @xmath59 , which yields a molecular mass fraction in total ( dynamical ) mass of about 0.12 .",
    "the dynamical mass within the 1.5 kpc radius ( 15@xmath3 ) region , where the co map is obtained , is @xmath60 , yielding a molecular mass fraction of only 0.051 .",
    "therefore , the molecular - to - total mass ratio in the central region of ngc 4527 is not particularly high , but is approximately the same as that of the mean value in the whole milky way .",
    "the distribution of the intensity - weighted mean velocity of the co - line emission is shown in figure 3 .",
    "equal - velocity contours around the nucleus are aligned at a position angle of @xmath61 , showing that the rotating disk has the major axis at 55 .",
    "this direction is shifted by about @xmath62  from that of the optical major axis of the galaxy ( 66 ) in the opposite sense to that of the elongation of the intensity map . if we take into account the inclination of the galaxy , @xmath63 , the tilt of the equal - velocity contours from a pure - circular velocity contours on the plane of the galaxy , @xmath64 , is given by @xmath65 ; therefore , @xmath66 .",
    "hence , non - circular velocities of the disk rotation is estimated to be @xmath67 , of the order of the velocity resolution of co observation .",
    "so , we may safely assume that the rotation of the co disk is approximately circular .",
    "      figure 4 shows the obtained position - velocity ( pv ) diagram of the co line emission along the major axis .",
    "the major pv feature shows a peculiar bend , which can be interpreted as being due to two superposed pv features : ( a ) a steep component with a velocity gradient as large as 200 /5@xmath3= 200 /400 pc across the nucleus , which indicates a molecular disk or ring of radius 3@xmath3 , or 240 pc .",
    "( b ) a higher - velocity , larger - radius ring with a velocity gradient of 450 /@xmath68 /7.5@xmath69 /600 pc .",
    "in addition to these major features , we can recognize ( c ) a lower - velocity , smaller - gradient pv component crossing the major pv feature , which may be due to foreground / background spiral arms .",
    "this low - velocity component is also clearly visible in the optical pv diagrams in the  and  lines ( figure 5 ) .    ",
    "      figure 5 shows the  ( lower ) and  ( upper ) pv diagrams , where the continuum light has been subtracted by using the background - filtering technique .",
    "the rotation velocity in the  and  emission lines rises very steeply near the nucleus .",
    "the  pv diagram shows a steep rise in the central region with a slope of 200 /@xmath70 = 200 /400 pc , also indicating a ring - like distribution of  regions with a radius of 450 pc .",
    "this feature coincides with the innermost , steep velocity gradient co feature . in the right panel of figure 4 , we superpose the co and  pv diagrams .",
    "it is interesting to note that the  feature is located inside the high - velocity co feature ( b ) .",
    "the  pv diagram shows about the same behavior as the  line .",
    "however , the innermost   feature shows a higher - velocity component with a steeper gradient , which is more coincident with the innermost co pv feature . this  feature attains a maximum velocity of about 250  in the central 400 pc region , indicating a very steep rise of the rotation curve in the inner 400 pc , attaining a maximum velocity as high as 250 .",
    "since the  line could be superposed by a broad balmer absorption wing toward a star - forming a disk in a galaxy , the  line would be more reliable to trace the innermost kinematics ( see sofue et al .",
    "therefore , we adopt the largest rotation velocities for the innermost region , e.g. within 500 pc .    ",
    "      figure 6 shows line profiles of the co , , and  lines .",
    "note that the  and  pv diagrams are similar to each other , indicating that the  line profile is not affected by the agn activity .",
    "the co profile is more complicated compared to the optical profiles , which may indicate a more irregular distribution of molecular gas compared to the star - forming regions , which is already revealed by the asymmetric co - intensity distribution .",
    "both the  and  optical profiles are characterized by their double horn feature , typical for a rotating disk .",
    "the line widths for co and  lines are , however , very similar , both about 450  at the 20% level of the peak intensity , indicating that molecular gas and star - forming regions are rotating in a similar manner .",
    " fig . 6       although the kinematical property is nearly symmetric as can be seen in the pv diagrams and velocity field , some small non - circular motion of @xmath71  appears to be superposed , suggesting a slightly distorted potential and density waves .",
    "since the gas mass is much smaller than the dynamical mass , such density waves would cause a non - linear response of the gas associated with strong compression , resulting in an asymmetry of the molecular gas distribution .",
    "star formation would occur intensely in such compressed gaseous regions .",
    "in fact , ngc 4527 shows a weak starburst .",
    "the far - infrared luminosity is @xmath72 ( soifer et al .",
    "1987 ) corresponding to a star - formation rate of 10  @xmath73  yr@xmath10 ( sauvage , thuan 1992 ) , much more intense than that of our galaxy center .",
    "we derived a rotation curve by applying an envelope - tracing method ( sofue 1996 ) to the present pv diagrams .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the interstellar gas ( @xmath74 ) and the velocity resolution of observations ( @xmath75 ) were corrected for as the following .",
    "the correction for the finite - velocity resolution , @xmath76 ( full width of half maximum ) , is given by @xmath77 .",
    "$ ] here , @xmath78 is the velocity difference between the maximum - intensity velocity near the profile edge , and the half - maximum velocity ( half width of the intensity slope at the velocity edge ) .",
    "equation ( 1 ) implies that , if the original velocity profile of the source is sharp enough , the observed profile becomes the telescope velocity profile , so that the correction is equal to the velocity resolution ( @xmath79 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the velocity profile of the source is extended largely ( @xmath80 ) , the correction becomes negligible ( @xmath81 ) and the half - maximum velocity gives the rotation velocity .",
    "the terminal velocity @xmath82 is defined by the velocity at which the intensity becomes equal to @xmath83 in the pv diagrams .",
    "then , the rotation velocity is estimated by @xmath84/{\\rm sin}~i.$ ] for the present galaxy , we take @xmath85 , @xmath86 for co , and @xmath87 for .",
    "the obtained rotation curve using the co , and  pv data is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the innermost curve within 500 pc radius was obtained by adopting the largest values among the three lines , because the co data may miss the highest velocities for its lower angular resolution than optical . the curve at radius 500 to 1.5 kpc is an average of the three lines , and the outer part is based on the  line alone .",
    "the co and  rotation curves derived by this method show a maximum of 250  in the 500-pc ring .",
    "the rotation velocity , then , decreases to 170  at 2 kpc , beyond which , it increases gradually to attain a flat rotation of about 200  at radius 5 to 12 kpc .",
    "the combined rotation curve from the co and  data is shown by the thick line in the figure .    ",
    "    the high - velocity rotation around the center may indicate the existence of a massive core with a scale radius smaller than several times 100 pc , possibly in addition to the bulge component obeying an exponential or a de vaucouleurs law .",
    "the rotation curve of ngc 4527 shows a remarkable similarity to the rotation curve of the milky way and many other galaxies .",
    "we stress that such a behavior of nuclear rise of rotation curves will be universal for massive spiral galaxies , with only a few exceptions of dwarf and small - mass galaxies ( sofue et al .",
    "we have obtained interferometer observations of the co ( @xmath0 ) line emission using the nobeyama millimeter array , and  and   line spectroscopy using the okayama 188-cm reflector along the major axis .",
    "while the co distribution shows asymmetry and is elongated in a direction at a position angle of 80 , the kinematical position angle inferred from the velocity field is 55and approximately coincides with the direction of the optical major axis , suggesting that the non - circular motion is not dominant . besides the kinematical structure , the distribution of  regions in the pv diagram show symmetry around the nucleus .",
    "the molecular - gas mass inferred from the co intensity shares only 10% of the total ( dynamical ) mass in the central 1 kpc radius region , and is only 5% in 1.5 kpc radius region .",
    "we have derived a nucleus - to - disk rotation curve using the co , , and  pv diagrams along the major axis .",
    "the rotation velocity rises steeply within 400 pc of the nucleus to about 230 - 250 , indicating a massive core around the nucleus .",
    "the rotation curve , then , decreases to a minimum at 2 kpc , followed by a disk and outer flat part .",
    "such a behavior of the rotation curve mimics that of the galaxy and of many other galaxies .",
    "the observations were made during the course of common - use programs at the nobeyama radio observatory and the okayama astrophysical observatory of the national astronomical observatories .",
