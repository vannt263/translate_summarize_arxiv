    "it has been realized in recent years that the quantum features of the correlations exhibited by multipartite quantum systems are manyfold , entanglement being only one of the possible non - classical manifestations  @xcite .",
    "even separable mixed states ( that are not entangled ) can have correlations with subtle non - classical properties  @xcite .",
    "several quantitative measures have been proposed to study the different non - classical aspects ( besides entanglement ) of the correlations appearing in composite quantum systems . among these measures we can mention quantum discord  @xcite and the measures of correlations based on the disturbances of quantum states arising from local measurements .",
    "the latter ones were advanced by luo  @xcite and by saitoh and collaborators  @xcite . in the case of pure states",
    "all these measures coincide with quantum entanglement .",
    "however , in the case of mixed states these quantities correspond to physical properties of quantum systems that differ from entanglement .    it is generally agreed that the states of a bipartite system that are to be regarded as being only classically correlated ( that is , having no quantum correlations ) are those described by density matrices that are diagonal in a product basis @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are orthonormal bases associated with the two subsystems , @xmath3 being the dimensions of the concomitant hilbert spaces .",
    "it is worth stressing that the set of classical states is different from the set of separable ( that is , non entangled ) states .",
    "indeed , there are important differences between these two sets .",
    "for instance , the set of separable states is convex , while the set of classical states is not  @xcite .",
    "also , measures of non - classicality such as discord do not satisfy monogamy relations  @xcite , which constitutes a basic property of quantum entanglement .",
    "it is usually assumed that classical states do not provide resources for information processing or information transmission , based on quantum correlations .",
    "consider two parties @xmath4 and @xmath5 , that share a quantum state of a bipartite system consisting of two subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath4 is in possession of subsystem @xmath6 while @xmath5 is in possession of subsystem @xmath7 ) .",
    "now , assume that one or both subsystems ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) are themselves composite systems .",
    "then , as it was shown by li and luo , tracing over part of one ( or both ) subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath7 , it is possible to obtain a state with quantum correlations , even if the original joint state of the composite @xmath8 was classical .",
    "this is an interesting effect , because it indicates that the aforementioned classical state of the composite system @xmath9 may have some  hidden \" quantum correlations .",
    "the aim of the present contribution is to study in detail this effect for some families of states of systems of three qubits .",
    "the approach to quantum correlations proposed by luo  @xcite on the basis of measurement induced disturbances has two desirable features .",
    "first , it has a direct and intuitive interpretation in terms of the basic notion that in classical settings one can do a measurement on a system without disturbing it . in quantum scenarios , on the contrary , measurements usually lead to disturbances on the systems being measured .",
    "luo applies these ideas to the study of correlations in bipartite systems . according to this approach ,",
    "a bipartite system has only classical correlations if it is possible to conduct local measurements on both subsystems that do not disturb the global state of the composite system .",
    "if this can not be done , the ( minimum ) size of the disturbance due to local measurements constitutes a quantitative measure of the quantumness of the correlations exhibited by the system under consideration .",
    "another advantage of luo s proposal is that the concomitant measure of the quantum character of correlations is computationally more tractable than other measures , such as quantum discord .",
    "it is important to emphasize that both quantum discord and the notion of quantum correlations based upon measurement induced disturbances determine the same family of classical states of a quantum bipartite system",
    ". as already mentioned , these states are those described by density matrices that are diagonal in a product basis .",
    "indeed , it is shown in  @xcite that a quantum state @xmath10 of a bipartite system is undisturbed by appropriate ( un - read ) local measurements if and only if @xmath10 is diagonal in a product basis .",
    "this suggests a natural way of assessing the `` amount of quantumness '' exhibited by the correlations present in a quantum state @xmath10 , by recourse to the minimum possible `` distance '' between @xmath10 and the disturbed state @xmath11 resulting from a local measurement  @xcite .",
    "given a bipartite system s density matrix @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 the pertinent reduced densities , one defines the measure @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mutual quantum information between the two parties @xmath6-@xmath7 of @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the classical mutual information ascribed to the post - measurement state @xmath19:=\\sum_{m , n}{\\pi_{mn}\\rho^{ab } \\pi_{mn}}}$ ] , such that @xmath20 is a projective measurement ( complete and bi - local ) on @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath21 is the von neumann entropy of the state @xmath10 .",
    "we are particularly interested in measurement induced disturbances ( mids ) . now",
    "the set @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) corresponds to the eigen - projectors of the spectral decomposition of the state @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "since mids do not involve any kind of optimization , they may overestimate sometimes quantum correlations .",
    "this problem has been dealt with in several ways .",
    "one of them is the symmetric discord @xmath26 where @xmath27 corresponds to the post - measurement state resulting from the general local measure @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "our main goal here is to detect non - classicality . as a consequence",
    ", overestimation does not constitute an important problem for us .",
    "thus , we focus attention on mids given the tractability of the associated computational problem , both from the analytical and the numerical viewpoints .    as mentioned before ,",
    "a bipartite state is _ classical _ if and only if it is diagonal in one special basis , that of the local eigen - projectors , and can thus be expressed as @xmath29 with @xmath30 a bivariate probability distribution @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "li and luo  @xcite demonstrated that any separable state ( classical or not ) can be regarded as embedded in a classical state of a system of larger dimensionality .",
    "reciprocally , given a classical state @xmath12 , any reduction would lead to a separable state in a space of lesser dimension .",
    "thus , a classical state s reduction might generally be a non - classical one .",
    "this is the fact on which we will concentrate our efforts , i.e. , _ the possibility of finding reduced states correlated ( in quantum fashion ) , starting from a classical state_.    we consider a classical state @xmath12 and analyze the possibility of encountering non - classical reductions .",
    "we begin by enumerating some mid - properties that apply for an arbitrary reduced state of @xmath12 whenever this classical state is defined via eq .  .",
    "assume that both parties are amenable to further decomposition such that their associated hilbert spaces can be cast as tensor products @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the joint state of the parties @xmath35 and @xmath36 is @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "thus , we can apply our quantum correlations measure between these two components : @xmath40 so as to compute quantum correlations using eq .  .",
    "firstly , we realize that for any state @xmath12 ( classical or not ) , given the positivity of @xmath18 , one has @xmath41 with strict equality @xmath42 iff the post - measurement classical state is a product state , so that @xmath19\\equiv\\rho^a\\otimes\\rho^b}$ ] , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 coinciding with the states of the parties before measurement , that does not modifies the reduced states of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we introduce now , with regards to the reduction of @xmath43 , a series of bounds that improve on eq .  .",
    "* given the strong subadditivity of von neumann s entropy , one can verify that @xmath44 in particular , if @xmath12 is classical , then @xmath45 measures its classical correlations .",
    "accordingly , eq .   implies that _ quantum correlations between @xmath35 and @xmath36 have as an upper bound the classical correlations between @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the composite system_. equality @xmath46 holds iff @xmath47\\equiv\\rho^{a_i}\\otimes\\rho^{b_j}}$ ] .",
    "moreover , if @xmath17 is classical , then @xmath48 , with @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) the shannon entropies of the marginal distributions @xmath51 and @xmath52 , associated respectively to @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "thus , given @xmath17 classical , one has @xmath55 * also , @xmath56 have as an upper bound the entropies of the pertinent parties , i.e. @xmath57 where @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) stands for von neumann s entropy for @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) . to prove it is enough to point out that @xmath62 and @xmath63 are concave functions because @xmath43 is separable  @xcite",
    "accordingly , @xmath64 is greater than either @xmath58 or @xmath59 , so that @xmath65 . in view of ,",
    "the bound follows immediately .",
    "this inequality reveals just how the quantum correlations between two system s components are conditioned by the dimensionality of the parties , with @xmath66}$ ] . * lastly , note that a sufficient condition for the reduction @xmath67 ( of the classical state @xmath17 ) to be classical as well , i.e. , that @xmath68 , is that @xmath69 and @xmath70 be sets of mutually commuting operators . in such a case ,",
    "there exist common basis of eigen - projectors for each party , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , so that it is possible to express the composite state in the fashion @xmath73 it is worth mentioning , however , that the commutativity condition of the sets @xmath69 and @xmath70 is not necessary for the classicality of @xmath67 .",
    "it is still possible to encounter classical states even if this commutativity is not verified  @xcite .",
    "we pass now to a single example in which to observe the phenomenon we are interested in : a three - qubits bipartite system .",
    "consider the special bipartite state @xmath17 exhibiting the following features .",

    "so as to encounter quantum correlations in the reduced state @xmath79 , we need that some of the members of the set @xmath80 do not commute amongst themselves .",
    "for instance , define the operators @xmath81 with @xmath82 with the states given by @xmath83 and @xmath84 , for the basis of @xmath6 , and the operators @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 for subsystem @xmath7 . using these basis",
    ", we numerically compute the measures @xmath88 for a sample of @xmath89 states with randomly generated distributions @xmath30 . in the graph @xmath88 vs. @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mvsi_rand ] ) we see that the ensuing states almost completely fill up the region lying under the straight line of unit slope @xmath90 .",
    "such result agrees with the upper bound anticipated by eqs .   and .",
    "note that all classical states of the composite system @xmath91 ( not only those belonging to the family - ) correspond to points that must lie within the above triangular region of the @xmath92 plane .",

    "assume that the hilbert spaces of @xmath6 and @xmath7 have dimensions that are composite numbers ( that is , they are not prime numbers ) .",
    "in that case the subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath7 can always be regarded formally as composite systems ( this possibility is related to the fact that the tensor - product structure of the hilbert space of composite systems is indeed observe - dependent . see for instance  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "consequently , a classically correlated state of the composite @xmath8 can have  hidden \" quantum correlations that correspond to a reduced state obtained by tracing over  part \" of subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath7 , if these subsystems are appropriately regarded as factorized into subsystems .",
    "this , in turn , suggests the intriguing possibility that , besides the quantum correlations themselves , the dimensionality of the subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath7 should be regarded as  resources \" in the sense that , the larger are these dimensions ( provided that they are composite numbers ) the larger the amount of  hidden \" quantum correlations that can be extracted from the original state by recourse to appropriate reductions .",
