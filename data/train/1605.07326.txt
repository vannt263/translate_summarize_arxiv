    "<S> ( b ) @xmath64 , where the apparent time - reversal symmetry breaking is ineffective due to spin relaxation , which engenders a phase difference @xmath65 between time - reversed trajectories and therefore a destructive interference , leading to weak anti - localization and negative magneto - conductance at low fields . </S>",

    "<S> , we have shown the emergence of a gauge field associated with the spin - berry connection in corrugated tmdc crystals . </S>",
    "<S> the phases accumulated by electrons and holes moving along curved sections of the crystal give rise to corrections in their single- and two - particle properties due to quantum interference . </S>",
    "<S> the former can be detected as a variation in the local density of states in the vicinity of corrugations and topological defects , whereas the latter may explain the suppressed localization effects observed in magneto - transport experiments in single - layer mos@xmath67,@xcite in contrast to the conventional weak localization behavior in the multi - layer counterpart.@xcite this analysis could be extended to other systems such as zinc - blende semiconductors and surface states of topological insulators . </S>",
