    "recently , iterative processing on _ spatially coupled _ sparse graphs has received a lot of attention in the literature .",
    "the concept of coupling a sequence of identical small structured graphs into a chain with improved properties , first demonstrated in the context of ldpc convolutional codes  @xcite , has been shown to be applicable to a diverse list of topics , such as compressed sensing @xcite , multiuser communication @xcite@xcite , quantum codes @xcite , and models in statistical physics @xcite .",
    "ensembles of spatially coupled ldpc codes ( sc - ldpccs ) can be obtained by terminating regular ldpc convolutional code ensembles @xcite .",
    "the slight irregularity resulting from the termination of the convolutional codes has been shown to lead to substantially better belief propagation ( bp ) decoding thresholds compared to corresponding block , or _",
    "uncoupled _ , code ensembles for a variety of channels @xcite .",
    "further , it has recently been proven analytically for the binary erasure channel ( bec ) that the bp decoding thresholds of regular sc - ldpcc ensembles approach the maximum a posteriori probability ( map ) decoding thresholds of the corresponding ldpc block code ensembles @xcite .",
    "the reduced check node degrees at the ends of the spatially coupled chain result in highly reliable information , which then propagates through the sc - ldpcc chain during the iterative decoding process . as a result ,",
    "this ` flow ' of reliable information leads to improved iterative decoding performance .",
    "however , a large number of iterations , and consequently a large amount of computation , is needed for the coded symbols in the middle of the chain to be decoded reliably",
    ". improved iterative decoding schedules that attempt to reduce the number of computations per bit to practically reasonable values have recently been proposed .",
    "these include windowed decoding  @xcite , for which updates of the reliability values are performed within a window sliding along the coupled chain , as well as a decoding schedule where updates are only performed for nodes where there is a potential improvement in the reliability value  @xcite .",
    "these improved schedules guarantee that the number of computations per bit is independent of the length of the chain . however",
    ", further improvement is challenging for single , linear , spatially coupled chains .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to connect several individual chains of spatially coupled graphs to form more general graphs .",
    "the reliability information that propagates through the individual chains during the iterative decoding process may now spread in multiple directions , thus triggering further performance improvement .",
    "this decoding improvement can come from check nodes of reduced degree or variable nodes of increased degree , and it can arise simultaneously in several parts of the graph and then combine to facilitate decoding convergence . we demonstrate improved iterative decoding thresholds for the binary erasure channel ( bec ) and the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel and a reduced number of computations per bit required to reach a desired probability of error .",
    "moreover , we show that the connected structures , like the individual chains , are asymptotically good .",
    "although in this paper we limit our study to a construction consisting of two parallel linear coupled chains connected by two bridges , the concept can be easily generalized .",
    "we start by describing a sc - ldpcc ensemble in terms of its protograph representation .",
    "a protograph @xcite is a small bipartite graph connecting two sets of nodes , a set of variable nodes and a set of check nodes .",
    "a protograph which represents a terminated chain of coupled @xmath0-regular ldpc codes of length @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : parallel](a ) . the variable nodes are black and the check nodes are green .",
    "each variable node is connected to @xmath2 check nodes and each check node is connected to @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 variable nodes .",
    "the associated bi - adjacency matrix @xmath6 of this protograph is called the _ base _ matrix .",
    "the parity - check matrix @xmath7 of a protograph - based ldpc block code ( a member of the ensemble ) can be created by replacing each non - zero entry in @xmath6 by a permutation matrix of size @xmath8 ( for protographs with single edge connections ) and a zero entry by the @xmath9 all - zero matrix . in graphical terms , this can be viewed as taking an @xmath8-fold graph cover or `` lifting '' of the protograph .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 is referred to as the lifting factor .",
    "it is an important feature of this construction that each lifted code inherits the degree distribution and local graph neighborhood structure of the protograph .",

    "[ fig : parallel](a ) can be viewed as a row of simple vertical graphs ( segments ) where two variable nodes are connected to the check node located in between .",
    "these segments are then coupled , i.e. , each segment is connected to one segment on the left and one on the right ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : parallel](b ) ) . to effect termination ,",
    "one extra check node is required at each end of the chain . coupling a sequence of graphs in such a way has two immediate consequences :",
    "1 ) there is a loss in rate that diminishes as the length @xmath10 of the chain grows , and 2 ) we observe a threshold improvement compared to the uncoupled ldpc code ensembles .",
    "two protograph chains may be connected as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : connector ] .",
    "the horizontal chain continues to the left and right while the vertical chain is terminated at the top .",
    "the first check node at the top of the vertical chain has degree two and the second node degree four .",
    "therefore , in order to form degree six check nodes , we connect the first check node of the vertical chain to variable nodes of the horizontal chain with four additional edges and the second check node of the vertical chain to variable nodes of the horizontal chain with two additional edges . as a result",
    ", the degrees of several variable nodes in the horizontal chain are increased by one .",

    "an example of such a construction is given in fig .",

    "each of the four connections between bridges and chains is made as shown in fig .",

    "generalizing this example , we consider an ensemble of protographs , denoted by @xmath14 , that consists of two chains of length @xmath10 that are connected by two bridges of length @xmath15 .",
    "the connecting points are located at a distance of @xmath16 from the ends of the chains .",
    "the rate of the ensemble @xmath14 is given by @xmath17",
    "since every member of the protograph - based ensemble preserves the structure of the base protograph , density evolution analysis for the resulting codes can be performed within the protograph . in this section ,",
    "we discuss density evolution for the case of the bec ( iterative decoding threshold results are also presented for the awgn channel in section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we assume that bp decoding is performed after transmission over a bec with erasure probability @xmath18 . in every decoding iteration ,",
    "all of the check nodes are updated followed by all of the variable nodes .",
    "the messages that are passed between the nodes represent either an erasure or the correct symbol value ( @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) .",
    "we denote the set of variable nodes connected to check node @xmath21 by @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and the set of check nodes connected to variable node @xmath24 by @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the probability that the message passed from check node @xmath21 to variable node @xmath24 in iteration @xmath27 is an erasure is denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the probability of an erasure message from variable node @xmath24 to check node @xmath21 is similarly denoted by @xmath29 .",

    "the error probability of the variable nodes at iteration @xmath27 can be calculated as @xmath32    the error probability evolution equations given above indicate that an increase in the number of variable node connections will improve the decoding performance ( lower the erasure probability ) , while an increase in the number of check node connections will degrade it .",
    "therefore , each connection between a protograph chain and a bridge in the ensemble @xmath14 is made by connecting some of the variable nodes in the chain to the check nodes with reduced degrees at the end of the bridge ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : connector ] ) .",
    "the degrees of the check nodes in the resulting construction do not exceed @xmath3 , while some of the variable nodes involved in the connection have degree @xmath4 instead of @xmath2 . focusing on a reduction in complexity",
    ", we consider simultaneous decoding of the entire code graph , where we employ the updating schedule proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm designates a target convergence probability @xmath33 as well as an update improvement constraint @xmath34 .",
    "regular message passing updates are performed for each variable or check node with the exception of the following conditions :    * no update for variable node @xmath24 is performed if the error probability @xmath35 ; * no update for any variable node @xmath24 , or any check node @xmath21 , is performed if all the nodes in @xmath25 , or @xmath22 , respectively , were not updated in the previous iteration ; * no update for variable node @xmath24 is performed if the potential improvement of the bit error probability is less than @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath36    it can be observed that , during every iteration , different sets of nodes are active in the graph . the convergence of the error probability spreads from the ends of the parallel chains into the main square of the graph ( see fig .  [ fig:2c2b ] ) .",
    "as will become evident later in this section , the sets of nodes with the fastest convergence are known in advance , so scheduling can be arranged such that the best set of nodes is transmitted , received , and decoded first .",
    "this set is then followed by the set of nodes with the second fastest convergence , which is then transmitted and decoded , and so on .",
    "this approach , suitable for the ensemble @xmath14 , can be seen as an attractive alternative to the windowed decoding approach ( which is a good choice for decoding an individual sc - ldpcc chain @xmath37 ) . coupled graph segments .",
