    "geometry of a space , which is characterized by dimensionality and topology , is a very important factor for the collective dynamics and statics of the elements embedded on it .",
    "it takes special significance in critical phenomena where correlation length diverges .",
    "critical phenomena have been one of the main subjects of statistical physics and intensively studied over various systems such as interacting spin models , map cellular - automata , percolation , _",
    "etc_. in recent years , more and more attention has been paid to critical phenomena on a class of graphs which have quite different properties with those on the well - studied euclidean lattices .",
    "one representative example is the class , so - called blue(almost ) transitive _ nonamenable graphs _ ( nags ) @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ , cayley trees , hyperbolic lattices and enhanced trees @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : etb ] for the binary case ) . here",
    "`` transitive '' graph means that all vertices on it play exactly the same role in the large size limit .",
    "the fundamental property of transitive nags is that the number of vertices in a ball centered at the origin increases exponentially with the radius .",
    "recent studies have reported that this property crucially affects the collective dynamics to make it differ much from those on euclidean lattices @xcite .",
    "although it seems that such graphs are non - realistic and studies on them are only for theoretical interests , their distinctive features , so - called _ small - world _ property and a non - zero clustering coefficient , are common with _ complex networks _ , which are widely found in the social and natural systems @xcite .",
    "for example , percolation problems on complex networks are related to error and attack tolerance and cascade failures of real world systems @xcite . instead of extensive studies the interplays between network structures and critical phenomena",
    "is still unclear .",
    "transitive nags has large advantages in its simplicity , e.g. , regularity of the lattice , compared with usually studied complex networks .",
    "studies on them has have a possibility to give a breakthrough on this complex problem .",
    "the number of _ ends _ , which indicates a kind of vulnerability of graphs , is an important concept for nags .",
    "the number of ends @xmath4 of an infinite graph @xmath5 is defined as the supremum of the number of infinite connected components in @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is the graph obtained from @xmath5 by removing arbitrary finite subgraph @xmath7 and the bonds incident to those . while trees have infinitely many ends , hyperbolic lattices and enhanced trees have only one end .",
    "recent analytical studies have indicated that the bernoulli bond percolation on nags with one end exhibits a new type of phase transition , so - called _ multiple phase transition _",
    "( mpt ) , which takes three distinct phases according to open bond probability @xmath0 as follows @xcite :    *   _ nonpercolating phase _ : there is no infinite cluster for @xmath8 . *   _ intermediate phase _ : there are infinitely many infinite clusters for @xmath9 . *",
    "_ percolating phase _",
    ": there is a unique infinite cluster for @xmath10 .    here _",
    "infinite cluster _ means a cluster whose mass diverges with system size @xmath11 as @xmath12 with @xmath13 . as well known for the euclidean lattices , any amenable graph , _",
    "e.g. _ , can have at most only one infinite cluster , i.e. , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "by contrast there are always plural infinite clusters in the percolating phases of trees .",
    "this is a consequence of infinitely many ends , i.e. , trees have no long cyclic paths and split easily .",
    "both of an exponential growth and sufficient amount of loops are necessary for graphs to exhibit three distinct phases .",
    "indeed , benjamini and schramm proved the existence of a mpt on any planar transitive nag with one end @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is proved that the transition at @xmath1 belongs to the mean - field universality class @xcite .",
    "previous studies of mpts have been restricted in the analytic way based on probability theory and we lack numerical research , which will bring us the quantitative indication of mpts . especially finite size effect is hardly investigated by the analytic approach .",
    "this effect is crrucial to argue the nags and the realistic network , where the typical length scale of the graphs often grows as a logarithmic function of the total number of vertices @xmath11 and is still small for considerably large @xmath11 . in this paper",
    ", we investigate a mpt by monte - carlo simulations taking the enhanced binary tree ( ebt ) as an example .",
    "our numerical results actually give two distinct critical probabilities @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "all the points in the intermediate phase @xmath3 are critical and there exist infinitely many infinite clusters .",
    "the corresponding fractal exponent continuously increases with @xmath0 from 0 to 1 and bridges a gap between non - percolating and percolating phases .",
    "in this section we provide a basic picture of mpts on nags .",
    "although we consider the ebt as an example , the concept is not specified to it .    at",
    "first we define an enhanced binary tree with @xmath15 generations .",
    "we prepare vertices @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the total number of vertices @xmath11 equals @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "inter - generation ( radial ) bonds are supposed between @xmath16 and @xmath21 and between @xmath16 and @xmath22 . these bonds yield a binary tree . furthermore intra - generation ( circumferential )",
    "bonds are added between @xmath16 and @xmath23 , which means `` enhanced '' .",
    "all of inter- and intra - generation bonds are open with homogeneous probability @xmath0 to yield connected clusters .",
    "ebt is not exactly _ transitive _ but _ almost _ transitive since the root vertex @xmath24 is special and the center can be defined .",
    "but this presumably does not affect the essential property of the critical phenomena .",
    "the following scenario is based on the natural assumption that the connectedness ( correlation ) function ; the probability that a vertex of the @xmath25-th generation is connected to the root clster , that @xmath24 belongs to , exponentially decays wiht @xmath25 as @xmath26 here @xmath27 means a correlation length along the generation ( radial ) direction and it monotonically increases with bond opening probability @xmath0 .",
    "the averaged mass of the root cluster @xmath28 is calculated by summing up the connectedness function as @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the number of vertices at the @xmath25-th generation taking a role of surface area factor . for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath28 converges to finite value in the thermodynamic limit @xmath33 . on",
    "the other hand @xmath28 diverges with @xmath15 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is important that the mass of cluster diverges despite of finite correlation length owing to the exponentially diverging surface area .",
    "this is an exact mechanism for the percolation transition on the binary cayley tree , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we can define the critical probability @xmath1 at which a correlation _ mass _ diverges . from equation ( [ eq : mass ] ) ,",
    "@xmath28 diverges very slowly with respect to the system size as @xmath38 above @xmath1 , @xmath28 diverges with the system size as @xmath39 where @xmath40 the exponent @xmath41 mimics @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the fractal dimension of a cluster embedded on the @xmath44-dimensional euclidean lattice .",
    "note that @xmath41 is a function of @xmath27 and increases with @xmath0 . even though a cluster mass diverges above @xmath1 , the ratio @xmath45 , which can be regarded as an order parameter , goes to zero for @xmath46 as far as @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath27 diverges at a certain @xmath0 , @xmath41 continuously approaches to 1 .",
    "we define the critical probability @xmath2 at which the correlation _ length _ diverges . at this critical point",
    "a prefactor of the connectedness function in equation ( [ eq : c0 ] ) in form @xmath48 takes an important role .",
    "the exponent @xmath49 corresponds to @xmath50 for the @xmath44-dimensional euclidean lattice .",
    "positive @xmath49 makes @xmath45 vanish in the thermodynamic limit and the order parameter continuously rising from zero at @xmath2 . in this case , however , @xmath45 at @xmath2 approaches to zero very slowly with @xmath11 as @xmath51 .",
    "the finite size dependences are summarized as @xmath52 the cluster mass shows fractal behavior in the phase @xmath53 in contrast with the euclidean lattice which has a critical _ point _ and unique fractal exponent .",
    "we consider the discrepancy of the probabilities for correlation mass and length is the key concept of the mpt on nags , which never occurs on the euclidean lattices . in the following section we confirm the validity of the scenario shown above by numerical simulations .",
    "here let us explain the detail of our monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the systems with @xmath54 are investigated .",
    "we generate samples , i.e. , sets of open and closed bonds , by using pseudo random number generated by the mersenne - twister method @xcite .",
    "the ensemble average of observed quantities is taken over 480,000 samples . in order to improve the precision of the average values for small @xmath0 , we treat the bonds which is connected to initial 3 generations exactly , i.e. , counting all @xmath55 possible realizations with probability @xmath56 , where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is the number of open ( closed ) bonds .",
    "this treatment only takes the cpu - time independent of @xmath11 .",
    "we also investigate the percolation on the dual lattice of the ebt ( see figure  [ fig : etb ] ) , which is also a nag with one end .",
    "each vertex of the dual lattice is put on the center of triangle or rectangle cells of the ebt and each bond , which is open with probability @xmath59 , crosses with the conjugate bond of the ebt . a duality relation @xmath60",
    "is known for dual planar nags @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section the @xmath11-dependence of @xmath28 for the finite size systems determines the expected three phases .",
    "so we estimate a fractal exponent @xmath61 so that @xmath62 . in practice",
    ", we calculate @xmath41 by the difference @xmath63/[\\ln(2n)-\\ln(n/2)]$ ] .",
    "this is a good approximation of equation  ( [ eq : psi_def ] ) for large @xmath11 when @xmath28 is a power function of @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath0-dependences of @xmath41 for both of the ebt and the dual lattice are shown in figure  [ fig : psi - p ] .",
    "three distinct phases can be observed as expected .",
    "the exponent @xmath41 of the ebt grows from zero to unity in the intermediate phase between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "oppositely @xmath41 of the duality lattice decrease from unity to zero between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this suggests the duality relation actually holds .",
    "the @xmath11-dependence of @xmath28 at @xmath1 is decided as follows .",
    "approaching @xmath1 from above , one expects that @xmath41 goes to zero but @xmath28 diverges as @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) at @xmath70 . to exclude the possibility that @xmath71 with @xmath72 , we plot @xmath73 as a function of @xmath0 in figure  [ fig : phi - p ] .",
    "as @xmath15 goes to infinity , @xmath74 decreases to zero for @xmath75 and diverges for @xmath76 . only at @xmath70",
    ", @xmath77 converges to @xmath11-independent value , which is estimated at unity .",
    "practically we obtain the precise critical probability @xmath78 from this crossing point and @xmath79 in the same way . using the duality relation ( [ eq : duality ] ) ,",
    "@xmath80 and @xmath81 are also determined .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cl_graph ] we show the geometry of the root cluster on the ebt by choosing samples which has a relatively large size cluster .",
    "figure [ fig : cl_graph](a ) is for @xmath82 .",
    "the cluster survive marginally ; its branches do not show spreading behavior , and therefore the mass of the cluster is proportional to the number of generations .",
    "figure [ fig : cl_graph](b ) shows the cluster at a middle point in the intermediate phase , which has many branches .",
    "the branches are spreading with the generation and tend to diverge .",
    "however this cluster occupies very small part of the whole system because spreading rate is slower than that of the ebt itself .",
    "consequently , there is a room for other infinitely large clusters .",
    "figure [ fig : cl_graph](c ) shows the cluster at @xmath83 .",
    "it looks compact and will occupy the finite fraction of the whole system in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "typical geometry of giant clusters in the system with @xmath84 for @xmath0=0.304(a ) , 0.400(b ) , 0.564(c ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] + ( a)(b)(c ) +    next we estimate the critical exponents of the first transition at @xmath70 .",
    "let us suppose a finite size scaling law @xmath85 for @xmath75 .. we use generation @xmath15 as a characteristic length instead of _ chemical distance _ in these papers .",
    "the number of retrenched horizontal paths is so small compared with vertical ones that we regard this change to be irrelevant . ]",
    "the scaling function @xmath86 should have asymptotic forms , @xmath87 figure  [ fig : s0-p ] shows a nice collapsing of data by using @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the data for the dual lattice also shows same scaling behavior ( the form of scaling function is very similar to the one for the ebt ) .",
    "this result confirms that the first transition at @xmath1 belongs to the mean field universality class ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite ) as predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand",
    "the transition at @xmath2 does not look like an usual continuous phase transition .",
    "the order parameter @xmath45 is fitted well by @xmath92 at @xmath83 using data for @xmath93 ( not shown here ) .",
    "this means @xmath94 @xmath45 has a finite limit value in @xmath95 at the critical point .",
    "we have to be careful to conclude such special feature , discontinuous transition in the framework of second order transition , but can say , at least , that @xmath49 is smaller than 0.083 .",
    "finally we investigate the distribution function @xmath96 , which is the number of clusters with size @xmath97 per vertex , in order to show that the system is always critical in the intermediate phase as already implied from the @xmath11-dependence of @xmath28 .",
    "we assume a finite size scaling law @xmath98 for fixed @xmath0 between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . here",
    "the scaling function @xmath99 is a power function @xmath100 for @xmath101 , and a rapidly decreasing function for @xmath102 . in the scaling plot ,",
    "figure  [ fig : n - s ] , we use @xmath41 evaluated by equation ( [ eq : psi_def ] ) and the scaling relation @xmath103 at each @xmath0 ( note that this relation is based on the scaling relation @xmath104 on the euclidean lattices ) . figure  [ fig : n - s ] strongly supports that the above finite size scaling ( [ eq : ns - scaling ] ) holds in the intermediate phase .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ns - scaling ] ) indicates that the characteristic size of clusters diverges with @xmath46 and a power - law distribution , @xmath105 , holds up to infinite @xmath97 .",
    "when such a power - law exists , it can be said that the number of infinite clusters is infinite because one can always find @xmath106 satisfying @xmath107 for any positive @xmath41 with which the number @xmath108 diverges in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "in conclusion , we studied the bond percolation problem on the enhanced binary tree by monte carlo simulations for the first time . we observed the intermediate phase in addition to the nonpercolating and percolating phases where the average cluster size is finite and in the same order of the whole system size @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "all the points in the intermediate phase is critical and the fractal exponent @xmath41 , where @xmath62 , increases continuously from zero to unity with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "note that the system looks critical in terms of mass of cluster , and the correlation length must diverge at @xmath2 .",
    "we expect that the mechanism of the mpt on the ebt is commonly observed in the other systems of nags with one end .",
    "there is , however , an interesting open problem , for both analytic and numerical studies , whether non - transitivity or inhomogeneity changes the scenario or not , which seriously corresponds to the complex networks .",
    "the present work is supported by 21st century coe program `` topological science and technology '' .",
    "we wish to thank h.shima and y.sakaniwa for their stimulating works , and k.nemoto and k.yakubo for helpful comments and discussions ."
