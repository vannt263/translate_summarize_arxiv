    "the attempt to understand the effects of coulomb interaction in solids  with exchange- and correlation effects being the most interesting manifestations  has always been a driving force behind research in solid state systems .",
    "nowadays , fabrication techniques for quantum dots offer the unique possibility to tailor interacting quantum systems to an unprecedented degree .",
    "understanding quantum dot helium , a man - made two - electron system , is a hallmark for our ability to design and control more complex interacting quantum systems such as those required for the implementation of quantum information processing schemes . here",
    ", we present a study of quantum dot helium fabricated on a parabolic quantum well@xcite which goes beyond earlier work@xcite by detecting higher lying excited states at high magnetic fields and by presenting evidence for the importance of correlation effects .",
    "parabolic quantum wells ( pqws ) based on gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as heterostructures have been introduced in 1988 for creating high mobility quasi - three - dimensional electron gases.@xcite within the effective mass approximation their conduction and valence band edges vary parabolically along the growth direction , as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , caused by the varying al content @xmath4 of the al@xmath0ga@xmath1as material .",
    "for example , the conduction band edge is described by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the curvature parameter of the parabolic confinement .",
    "a pqw can be filled with electrons using standard remote doping techniques .",
    "the electrons occupy subbands which form in the well self - consistently under the influence of the parabolic confinement and screening . with increasing two - dimensional electron density ,",
    "this interplay leads  in the limit of large density  to a constant three - dimensional electron density @xmath7 along with an increasing width of the density distribution in growth direction . here",
    ", @xmath8 is the relative dielectric constant of the material .",
    "a very peculiar property of pqws is the rigidity of the subband wave functions under the influence of an external homogeneous electric field @xmath9 in growth direction , given that the two - dimensional electron density is constant .",
    "such a field can , for example , be created with metallic gates on top and at the back side of the substrate .",
    "it is equivalent to an electrostatic potential changing linearly with @xmath10 which adds to the built - in @xmath11-confinement in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and leads to a net parabolic potential with the same curvature parameter @xmath6 , but shifted by @xmath12 in growth direction .",
    "if this shifted potential is populated with the same two - dimensional electron density , it will develop the same self - consistent subbands with the same envelope functions , but shifted in space by @xmath13 .",
    "this property of pqws has been exploited for mapping the subband wave function in real space.@xcite    in the al@xmath0ga@xmath1as material , the effective mass @xmath14 and the effective @xmath15-factor @xmath2 depend on the al fraction @xmath4 .",
    "for example , the effective @xmath15-factor varies according to @xmath16 the wave functions of subbands in pqws probe regions of varying @xmath4 and therefore feel an average @xmath2 .",
    "this average varies , when the wave function is shifted , providing a gate voltage tunable @xmath2 , i.e. , a gate voltage tunable zeeman splitting in a magnetic field.@xcite furthermore , pqws can be designed to have certain @xmath2 values when the wave function is positioned symmetrically around the minimum of the parabola at zero gate voltages by deliberately choosing a certain offset value for @xmath4 at the well center .",
    "for example , pqws with @xmath17 can be grown .",
    "recently , pqws have served as the basic material for the fabrication of mesoscopic devices such as quantum point contacts@xcite and quantum dots.@xcite in particular , the spin states in a quantum dot fabricated on a pqw were investigated@xcite and few - electron dots with 03 electrons were realized.@xcite such few - electron dots are candidates for the implementation of spin - qubits for quantum information processing.@xcite dots on pqws promise the additional feature of a tunable @xmath2 which could be used for the realization of gate - controlled single - qubit operations.@xcite",
    "the sample used for this study@xcite is a quantum dot ( qd ) with integrated charge readout fabricated on a pqw by electron - beam lithography .",
    "the pqw material has been designed and measured to have @xmath17 .",
    "a highly doped layer , 1.3  @xmath18 m below the well serves as a back gate .",
    "a scanning electron micrograph of the sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "the qd is formed by applying negative voltages to the gates pc1 , pc2 , pg and mg .",
    "the quantum point contact formed between gates pc2 and cd has been used as a detector for the charge in the quantum dot@xcite and allows to count the number of electrons in the dot from 0 upwards .",
    "experiments were performed in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 100  mk using standard low - frequency dc and ac conductance measurement techniques .",
    "the differential conductance of the qd has been measured in the few - electron regime as a function of plunger gate voltage @xmath19 and source  drain voltage @xmath20 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the resulting coulomb - blockade diamonds with the electron numbers @xmath21 indicated .",
    "the qd has a charging energy @xmath22  mev for the second electron .",
    "the lowest excited state es of the 1-electron system has an energy @xmath23  mev above the ground state",
    ". therefore , confinement and interaction effects are of comparable order of magnitude in this system .",
    "singlet ( s ) and triplet ( t ) resonances are observed in the differential conductance of the 2-electron dot .",
    "the singlet  triplet separation @xmath24 is about 2  mev .    for the investigation of the excitation spectrum of quantum dot helium , i.e. , the two - electron system , in a magnetic field",
    ", the qd was tuned into a slightly more open regime allowing the plunger gate to cover the range from @xmath25 to 3 .",
    "the excitation spectrum of the system was then recorded at fixed source ",
    "drain voltage @xmath26  mv as a function of plunger gate voltage @xmath19 and magnetic field @xmath27 .",
    "the result@xcite is shown in fig .  [ fig3](b ) ( upper panel ) .",
    "a number of transitions can be followed as a function of magnetic field : most prominent is the transition from the 1-electron ground state to the 2-electron singlet state , labeled @xmath28 .",
    "the first excitation at low @xmath27 is the triplet state labeled @xmath29 which becomes the ground state at a magnetic field @xmath30  t. the transition labeled @xmath31 appears at @xmath32  t in the bias window and shows an avoided crossing with @xmath28 indicating its spin - singlet character .",
    "the state @xmath33 appearing at even higher @xmath27 can only be identified by comparing to the results of an exact diagonalization calculation ( exd ) to be described below .",
    "it turns out to be combined excitation of the center of mass ( cm ) motion , the relative motion ( + ) and the spin degree - of - freedom ( t ) .",
    "in order to interpret the measured excitation spectra in detail , we present an exact diagonalization ( exd ) and an approximate ( generalized heitler - london , ghl ) microscopic treatment for two electrons in a _ single _",

    "we solve self - consistently the ensuing unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) equations allowing for lifting of the double - occupancy requirement ( imposing this requirement gives the _ restricted _ hf method , rhf ) .",
    "for the @xmath46 solution , this step produces two single - electron orbitals @xmath47 that are localized left @xmath48 and right @xmath49 of the center of the qd [ unlike the rhf method that gives a single doubly - occupied elliptic ( and symmetric about the origin ) orbital ] . at this step ,",

    "[ fig1_th_hmfw](a ) that the rhf method , which assumes that both electrons occupy a common single - particle orbital , is not able to reproduce the experimental findings . on the contrary , the ghl approach , which allows the two electrons to occupy two spatially separated orbitals , appears to be a good approximation . plotting the two ghl orbitals [ see fig .",

    "[ i.e. , @xmath96 as @xmath97 is a reflection of the dissociation of the 2@xmath64 molecule , since the ground - state energy of two fully spatially separated electrons ( zero overlap ) does not depend on the total spin .",
    "we stress again that the rhf , which corresponds to the more familiar physical picture of a qd - helium atom , fails to describe this dissociation , because @xmath94 diverges as the value of the magnetic field increases .",
    "in contrast to the rhf , the ghl wave function is able to capture the importance of correlation effects .",
    "further insight into the importance of correlations in our qd device can be gained through inspection@xcite of the conditional probability distributions@xcite ( cpds ) associated with the exd solutions ; see an illustration in fig .",
    "[ fig3_th_hmfw ] .",
    "indeed , already at zero magnetic field , the calculated cpds provide further support of the physical picture of two localized electrons forming a state resembling an h@xmath3-type@xcite wigner molecule.@xcite     and @xmath95 t. the cpd expresses the conditional probability for finding the second electron at position @xmath98 given that the first electron is located at @xmath99 ( denoted by a heavy solid dot ) .",
