    "the structure of excited @xmath2 states in deformed even - even nuclei is still a matter of controversial discussion despite intensive investigation .",
    "traditionally the first excited @xmath7 state has been interpreted as the @xmath4-vibrational excitation of the ground state .",
    "however , in many nuclei the @xmath7 state has only weak transitions to the ground - state band , while strong electric quadrupole transitions to the @xmath8 band have been found @xcite .",
    "this contradicts the traditional interpretation , since a transition from a @xmath4-vibrational state to the @xmath8 band is suppressed due to the destruction of a @xmath4 phonon and , at the same time , the creation of a @xmath8 phonon . in this picture a @xmath4-vibrational state is characterized by a strong transition to the ground - state band , namely by a large @xmath9  w.u .",
    "value and a strong e0 transition to the ground state with @xmath10 @xcite . only in very few cases , such as @xmath0sm @xcite and @xmath1er @xcite ,",
    "it has been possible to identify candidates for a @xmath4-vibrational state by @xmath8 spectroscopy .",
    "the unclear situation led to an intense debate about the structure of low - lying @xmath2 states .",
    "based on calculations using the interacting boson approximation ( iba ) @xcite , casten and von brentano @xcite have proposed that the @xmath7 state in deformed nuclei should be interpreted as a second @xmath8 phonon excitation built on the @xmath8 vibration . since in many cases",
    "the excitation energy of the @xmath7 state is located below the @xmath8 band and @xmath11 values to the ground - state band as well as to the @xmath8 band show large fluctuations , this interpretation has been challenged by burke and sood @xcite , kumar @xcite and gnther @xcite .    in the original work by casten and von brentano ,",
    "it was assumed that the deformed nuclei are best described by a small area in the parameter space of the iba , which led to the prediction of the character of the @xmath7 state in deformed nuclei as a two phonon @xmath12 vibration . in the framework of the simplified ecqf formalism",
    "@xcite nuclei are described by two parameters , @xmath13 and @xmath14 and two scaling factors for energies and transition rates , respectively .",
    "recent work by mccutchan et al .",
    "@xcite mapped the position of the deformed nuclei for different isotopic chains of rare earth nuclei within the iba symmetry triangle , revealing that the iba parameters to describe the low - lying structure of these nuclei can differ significantly .",
    "the position within the symmetry triangle for well - deformed nuclei was later related to the underlying single - particle structure near the fermi surface and the resulting quasi - particle structure of the @xmath8-vibrational state @xcite .",
    "it was also shown in recent years that the iba consistently predicts that the e0 strength from the first or second excited @xmath2 state in deformed nuclei is large @xcite . near the @xmath15 leg ( @xmath16 ) the @xmath7 state carries the e0 strength , while near the @xmath17 corner , the @xmath18 state exhibits large e0 strength . in an area in between the strength is shared among the @xmath7 and @xmath18 states .",
    "this iba prediction for well - deformed nuclei is not confirmed experimentally , due to the lack of measured @xmath19 values of the e0 strength for excited @xmath2 states in these nuclei .",
    "for the few measured examples , such as @xmath1er and @xmath20yb , where a small e0 strength was observed for the @xmath7 states , it is not clear if these @xmath2 states correspond to those for which the iba predicts large @xmath19 values .",
    "it is therefore important to obtain more experimental data on e0 strength in well - deformed nuclei , which may also lead to new insights in the nature of the low - lying @xmath2 states .",
    "it is the purpose of this letter to report on the first observation of large e0 strength of excited @xmath2 states in the well - deformed nuclei @xmath0sm and @xmath1er , which confirm the interpretation of the @xmath7 and @xmath6 states , respectively , as @xmath4-vibrational states .",
    "before we describe the details of the performed experiments and their results in the next sections , we will briefly review the existing information on @xmath2 states in @xmath0sm and @xmath1er . due to the existence of the systematic parameter studies @xcite and the explicit predictions of the e0 strength in well - deformed nuclei @xcite within the framework of the iba",
    ", we will concentrate our discussion in the final section on a comparison with iba calculations . although a similar comparison could and should be done on the basis of collective models , such as the general collective model ( gcm ) @xcite , we are not aware of a systematic set of gcm calculations , including predictions for the e0 strength , for the nuclei in question .",
    "the nature of excited @xmath2 states in @xmath0sm is particular interesting , since @xmath0sm is the only rare earth nucleus with two excited @xmath2 states below the excitation energy of the band head of the @xmath8 band at 1440  kev .",
    "the excitation energies of the two @xmath2 states are only 103  kev apart , however , they have very different properties . as the @xmath18 state is only weakly populated in coulomb excitation a small transition strength to the ground - state band can be concluded @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 state at 1099  kev has very different properties , the measured lifetime of 1.3(3 )  ps results in a rather large transition probability of @xmath21  w.u .. this leads to the interpretation of the @xmath7 state as being the @xmath4 vibration built on the ground state , while the @xmath18 state can not be interpreted as a collective excitation and also does not mix appreciably with the @xmath7 state . to confirm this interpretation , the electric monopole strength @xmath22 has to be determined .    in @xmath1er",
    "four excited @xmath2 states are known from two - neutron transfer experiments @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 values for the transitions from the first three excited @xmath2 states to the ground - state band and to the @xmath8 band were obtained from lifetime measurements using the doppler - shift attenuation method following inelastic neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath18 states at 1460  kev and 1713  kev have small @xmath23 values to both the ground - state band as well as to the @xmath8 band .",
    "this and the strong relative population in two - neutron transfer reactions @xcite suggests that these states are mainly pair - type excitations .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath6 state at 1934  kev has a strong transition strength branch to the ground - state band ( @xmath24  w.u . ) and no observable decay to the @xmath8 band .",
    "thus the @xmath6 state is interpreted as a @xmath4-vibrational state .",
    "in addition , a fifth @xmath2 state was reported in ref . @xcite and interpreted as the @xmath2 member of the @xmath12 phonon multiplet , due to its large @xmath25 value . as mentioned earlier ,",

    "however , no systematic studies exist at this point .    from the current investigation , we draw the conclusion , that it is very important to obtain as much detailed experimental information on all low - lying @xmath2 states as possible , including data on transfer strength as well as electromagnetic decay properties . in many cases , where only partial information on excited @xmath2 states is available , it is not clear that these states are indeed the ones described in the framework of the collective models .",
    "in addition , mixing of different structures can lead to significant modifications of the properties , leading to large deviations from the simple expectations , which should , if at all , just be used as guiding principles .    * acknowledgement * + we acknowledge fruitful discussions with prof .",
