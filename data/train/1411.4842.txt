    ", the speed of sound at the trap centre is @xmath53 mm / s ( where the 0-subscript denotes peak values ) , decreasing further out in accord with the decreasing density as @xmath54 .",
    "the laser obstacle is then adiabatically removed over 0.4s . as observed experimentally @xcite , and consistent with gpe simulations @xcite , vortices become nucleated for @xmath55mm / s , with the number of vortices generated increasing as @xmath1 is further increased .",
    "first we consider the circular obstacle employed in the experiment with @xmath56 mm / s , with the condensate evolution depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : circle08 ] .",
    "the translation of the trap initiates a centre - of - mass mode of the condensate . as the condensate",
    "first `` sloshes '' to the left past the obstacle , a large number of vortices are nucleated in an irregular manner from each pole ( 53  ms ) . significant energy is also driven into sound ( density ) waves , shock waves and shape excitations , which are visible in these plots . before the vortices are washed far downstream",
    ", the condensate sloshes to the right , generating further vortices and mixing together the old and new vortices ( 80  ms ) .",
    "this process repeats several times as the condensate sloshes .",
    "when the obstacle is removed a disordered arrangement of vortices is apparent ( 0.5  ms ) .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental observations , and synonymous with a state of two - dimensional quantum turbulence . following this",
    ", there is a slow decay in the vortex number . in our simulations , which are free of dissipation",
    ", this occurs through the annihilation of vortices of opposite circulation ; experimentally @xcite , and in the presence of dissipation terms to the gpe @xcite , vortices will also undergo thermal dissipation whereby they drift to the condensate edge and are lost .",
    "we now consider the case where the circular obstacle is replaced with an elliptical one ( with @xmath45 ) and ( for reasons to be made evident shortly ) a reduced speed @xmath57 mm / s .",
    "the vortices are now nucleated in a _ regular _ fashion , forming two clusters of like - signed vortices ( 53  ms ) , much like in the homogeneous system .",
    "no strong sound waves are visible in the condensate . as the condensate changes direction ,",
    "again two like - signed clusters are formed , but now with alternate polarity ( 80  ms ) . over time , these vortices mix together , and once the obstacle is removed , the condensate and vortex distribution is similar to the circular case . indeed , the number of vortices in the condensate is essentially identical for both cases ( @xmath58 vortices ) , despite the reduced speed for the ellipse .    at the same speed @xmath1",
    ", the elliptical obstacle will typically generate a larger number of vortices than the circular obstacle .",
    "for example , for @xmath57  mm / s , the ellipse and circle generate approximately 80 and 60 vortices , respectively ( measured following removal of the obstacle ) . however , for sufficiently high speeds ( @xmath59  mm / s ) the enhancement due to the elliptical obstacle diminishes ; in both cases the number of vortices driven into the condensate saturates .",
    "this suggests that for a given condensate there exists a natural maximum vortex density which can be supported .",
    "this limit is likely to be imposed by the quadratic increase of vortex annihilation events with vortex density @xcite , which will act to cancel out the freshly - nucleated vortices .",
    "through simulations of the gpe we have examined two - dimensional superfluid flow past an elliptical , rather than a circular , obstacle .",
    "this simple and experimentally feasible modification enables control over the critical speed for vortex nucleation , the vortex nucleation rate , and the ensuing vortex interactions . for an ellipse which is elongated perpendicular to the flow ,",
    "the enhanced vortex interactions promote the formation of quantum wakes ( composed of multiple singly - charged vortices ) which closely resemble those of classical ( viscous ) flow past a cylinder .",
    "our observations @xcite suggest the emergence of classical behaviour from the presence of a sufficient number of quanta    when incorporated into the experimental scenario of ref . @xcite , such classical - like wakes are formed initially but become disrupted by the limited size and sloshing mode of the system .",
    "employing a condensate which is elongated in the direction of translation would promote the formation of longer - lived vortex clusters , and provide an experimental route to study these wakes and more general coherent structures of quantized vortices @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , for the purposes of generating two - dimensional quantum turbulence , the elliptical obstacle allows for more efficient ( more vortices for a given speed ) and cleaner ( reduced disruption due to sound and shock waves ) nucleation of vortices .",
