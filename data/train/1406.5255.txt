    "first radio sources in the cosmos field whose observed 1.4  ghz fluxes are in the range expected for fr  is at @xmath35 ( 1@xmath36f@xmath3713 mjy ) are considered .",
    "sources with fr  ii radio morphology , i.e. showing clear edge - brightened radio structures , are rejected .",
    "3 .   those with bright optical counterparts ( m@xmath38 )",
    "are then excluded since they are likely lower redshift galaxies with radio emission produced by e.g. starbursts .",
    "note also that this constraint assumes that the magnitude of the fr  is hosts are similar to those of fr  iis .",
    "u - band dropouts are rejected as they are likely lyman - break galaxies at @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the selection of the radio sources is based mainly on a flux requirement , criterion ( 1 ) .",
    "the following ones ( 2 , 3 , 4 ) are used only to discard spurious sources from the sample .",
    "the source cosmos - fr  i  236 , tentatively classified in c09 as a qso , was later identified with a known qso at the spectroscopic redshift @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "similarly to what done for all sources in our sample ( see sect .  [",
    "par : subsample ] and sect.[sec : hlrgs ] ) , we estimate that the total radio power of this source is 1.96@xmath3010@xmath41  erg  s@xmath32  hz@xmath32 , based on its redshift and first radio flux of 7.10  mjy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we also assume a radio spectral index @xmath42 ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : k - correction ] ) .",
    "therefore , since this is typical of high power fr  iis and radio loud qsos , we do not consider this source in this paper .",
    "steepening the radio spectrum , i.e. increasing the value of the spectral index @xmath19 , would increase the estimated radio power , reinforcing our conclusions .",

    "[ par : subsample ] , [ sec : hlrgs ] ) .",
    "as the aim of this work is to search for clusters of galaxies in the fields of the low power radio galaxies of the c09 catalog , in the following section we redefine the sample by selecting only _ bona fide _ low luminosity objects , based on the latest photometric ( or spectroscopic , when available ) redshift estimates . while we can not exclude that the remaining ( high power ) sources are associated with a dense environment",
    ", we will consider them separately .",
    "hereinafter , we will refer to our sources using the i d number only , as opposed to the complete name cosmos - fr  i  nnn .",
    "the aim of this section is to derive a reliable sample of low luminosity radio galaxies ( llrgs ) that , based on the information available to date , have @xmath43 lower than the fiducial separation between fr  is and fr  iis . in order to do",
    "so we require robust measurements of the total radio fluxes , accurate photometric redshifts ( in absence of firm spectroscopic redshifts ) and assumptions on the k - correction .",
    "as discussed above , the c09 sample was selected using the radio fluxes from the first survey @xcite which was performed by using the vla b - configuration at 1.4  ghz and it covers 10,000 square degrees of the north and south galactic caps .",
    "the cosmos field entirely resides within the area mapped by first .",
    "post - pipeline radio maps have a resolution of @xmath44  arcsec .",
    "the detection limit of the first catalog is @xmath45  mjy with a typical rms of 0.15  mjy .",
    "when we make use of the first survey , we adopt the flux densities from the catalog as of october 10th , 2011 .",
    "however , the first radio maps may be missing a substantial fraction of any extended low surface brightness radio emission from the lobes of our radio sources , which are close to the detection limit .",
    "this is particularly important because of the relatively high angular resolution provided by the used vla configuration , which is more suitable for detecting compact or unresolved radio sources .    while being slightly shallower than first , the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) survey @xcite may be more suitable for our purposes , since it was obtained by using the vla - d configuration at 1.4  ghz .",
    "the angular resolution of the nvss radio maps is 45 arcsec ( fwhm ) .",
    "thus , it is more suitable for detecting extended emission of the sources in our sample",
    ". therefore , in order to derive the total radio luminosity of our sources , we use the nvss fluxes and upper limits ( as of october 10th , 2011 ) , when possible . in the nvss catalog at the coordinates of the c09 objects",
    ", we find 26 of the 36 sources .    while the first survey is complete down to a flux of 1  mjy , the completeness of the nvss catalog is only 50@xmath46 at its formal limit of 2.5  mjy , while rises rapidly to 99@xmath46 at 3.4  mjy @xcite .",
    "thus , the drawbacks of using nvss sources are as follows : i ) sources with total radio flux @xmath47  mjy might not be included .",
    "ii ) the identification of the nvss counterpart of each source is not trivial .",
    "due to the lower angular resolution rms uncertainties are about 7 arcsec at the nvss limit , as affected by confusion",
    ". furthermore , the extended radio morphology of many of the radio sources might be complex .",
    "therefore , since the nvss is more sensitive to the extended emission than first , the centroid of the first source could not coincide with that in the nvss map .",
    "also note that , even if the limit of the nvss catalog is set at 2.5  mjy , some of our fainter sources are detected in the radio maps .    to overcome these inconveniences we use first @xcite and vla cosmos @xcite .",
    "first has a flux density threshold of 1  mjy and a positional accuracy of @xmath481  arcsec for radio pointlike sources .",
    "vla cosmos has a angular resolution of 1.5@xmath301.4  and a sensitivity limit of 45  @xmath49jy / beam .",
    "it is therefore deeper and with higher angular resolution than first . for the majority of the objects it is straightforward to identify the radio sources in the above surveys",
    "the few cases in which the identification is problematic are discussed in the following .    for these cases",
    "we consider the vla cosmos maps to clearly identify the radio sources , as described in the following for source 05 . in figure",

    "the nvss catalog reports sources at distance of @xmath50 and @xmath51 arcsec to the sw and se from the vla - cosmos coordinates of the source 05 , and fluxes of 3.4 and 3.7  mjy , respectively .",

    "the radio contours from vla - cosmos are over - plotted in yellow .",
    "it is clear that the radio sources seen in vla - cosmos overlap with foreground galaxies .",
    "this generates the complex extended emission seen in the nvss map . by using higher resolution radio data and the optical image , we are able to overcome the confusion problem in the nvss map .",
    "the nvss catalog misses our source and detects only the two unrelated brighter radio emitting regions .",
    "similarly , other sources have extended radio morphology , as clear from visual inspection of the nvss maps .",
    "the angular separation between the coordinates reported in the nvss catalog and those obtained by using vla - cosmos are about @xmath2415  arcsec .",
    "this is the case of sources 26 , 52 , 202 , 224 , and 228 , where such angular separations are 15.37 , 16.4 , 12.82 , 12.43 , and 18.52 arcsec , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : nvssmaps_confusion ] we report the nvss fields of 26 and 224 , as examples .",
    "these sources show a radio morphology similar to that of 05 .",
    "however , a bright source is clearly present in each of these two fields , very close to the radio galaxy .",
    "they are merged in the nvss map in a single structure due to the low nvss angular resolution .",
    "we consider the radio nvss maps of all of the eight sources that are not present in the nvss catalog .",
    "we visually inspect each map and search for the presence of radio contours centered around the position of the radio source . for five out of the eight we find evidence of a radio source located at the coordinates of the radio galaxy .",
    "this is the case of sources 11 , 20 , 22 , 27 , and 39 , where the radio contours are consistent with a radio flux close to the nvss formal limit of 2.5  mjy . in figure",
    "[ fig : nvssmaps_offset ] we report the fields of 22 and 39 , as examples .",
    "being very close or below the formal completeness limit , we expect that possible systematics might occur in the flux measurements .",
    "therefore we adopt a fiducial 2.5  mjy upper limit for all of the eight sources which are not included in the nvss catalog .",
    "the fiducial first and nvss flux uncertainties for the sources in our sample are within @xmath240.1 - 0.2  mjy and @xmath240.4 - 0.6  mjy , respectively .",
    "however , we prefer not to report the flux uncertainty associated with each source . this is because we are considering fluxes down to the completeness limit of both the first and the nvss surveys and , therefore , the flux uncertainties might be underestimated .",

    "b13 also performed a more refined sed modeling , with the inclusion of two stellar populations . at variance with",

    "therefore , we conservatively select only those sources whose 1.4  ghz luminosity intervals lie entirely below the fr  i / fr  ii radio luminosity divide of @xmath69  erg  s@xmath32  hz@xmath32 . according to this criterion we select 21 _ bona fide _ llrgs , whose redshifts span the range z  =  0.88 - 1.33 and have radio luminosities between l@xmath70  = ( 0.84 - 3.24)@xmath3010@xmath71  erg  s@xmath32  hz@xmath32 . in figure",

    "@xcite report a range @xmath74 and a median value @xmath75 for their sample of 33 fr  is .    the llrgs span a limited range of luminosity and slightly broader of redshift .",
    "however , because of the steepness of the radio luminosity function , most sources are at @xmath01 .",
    "being at relatively low redshifts , these objects and their mpc - scale environment can be studied in greater detail than the whole sample of fr  i candidates considered in this work .",
    "this is mainly because cosmos field number densities are much higher and statistical photometric redshift uncertainties are smaller than at higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "furthermore , spectroscopic redshift information is available for some of the llrgs only and photometric redshifts from b13 are more accurate for the llrgs than for the hlrgs , being the latter , on average , at higher redshifts .",
    "therefore we separate the llrgs from the remaining sources , that are generally at higher luminosities and redshifts than the hlrgs .",
    "in particular , the photometric redshifts of the llrgs are better constrained , since the typical statistical uncertainty dramatically increases above @xmath76 ( see e.g. figure 9 in i09 ) and because all of the sources in our sample with spectroscopic redshifts belong to the llrg class .",
    "we consider in this section the remaining sources of the sample , i.e. the hlrgs , that do not belong to the llrg subclass .",

    "even if the radio sources are at redshift @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the ppm detects overdensities in their fields at @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "these results are not surprising since the p08 method is effective to find clusters at @xmath86 .    excluding the overdensity in the field of 13 that is not associated with source 13 , only five out of the 12 cluster candidates at @xmath81 in our catalog",
    "are also found with the p08 method . among the 12 clusters we conservatively do not consider the overdensities in the fields of the sources 38 and 228 . even if these sources have",

    "two out of the five clusters , namely 29 and 39 , that are associated with the radio galaxies and detected by both the p08 and the ppm , are around llrgs , the other three ( namely source 03 , 04 , and 28 ) are around hlrgs .",
    "as discussed above , source 39 is the only source out of those five that has a photometric redshift below @xmath90 .",
    "if we consider our seven cluster candidates at @xmath81 in our catalog that are not detected by the p08 method we find that three of them are associated with llrgs ( i.e. sources 2 , 22 , and 25 ) .",
    "the remaining four out of the seven are associated with @xmath81 hlrgs ( i.e. 05 , 34 , 37 , and 226 ) . since the p08 method was primarily designed to search mpc - scale overdensities at these redshifts , it is interesting that many of our @xmath81 cluster candidates are not detected by such a method .",
    "it is therefore worth reconsidering in more details our cluster candidates found around our @xmath81 sources .",
    "three of our cluster candidates are at @xmath91 .",
    "these are the overdensities associated with sources 03 , 05 , and 226 . as mentioned before ,",
    "the presence of mpc - scale overdensities around those sources were previously suggested in c10 .",
    "interestingly , the p08 method finds the overdensity in the field of 03 only .",
    "if we focus on the nine @xmath92 sources that the ppm finds to be in dense mpc - scale environments , ( i.e. sources 02 , 04 , 22 , 25 , 29 , 34 , 37 , 38 and 228 ) we find that only two out of the nine are found in dense environments by the p08 method ( i.e. sources 04 and 29 ) .",
    "however , among them , the estimated redshifts of the cluster candidates associated with the sources 37 and 38 are only marginally consistent within the redshift uncertainties of the two sources . these two cases could correspond to false positive overdensity ppm detections .",
    "furthermore , the p08 method should not be able to detect the @xmath93 overdensity associated with the source 38 , since such a redshift is well below the redshift range where the method is effective .",
    "the case of 37 is different , this is because the overdensity associated with this source has an estimated redshift @xmath94 .",
    "therefore it falls within the redshift range allowed by the method .",
    "excluding source 38 , the results reported above imply that @xmath95 of our @xmath92 cluster candidates are not detected by the p08 method ( we have conservatively excluded the above mentioned source 39 that is at redshift formally below @xmath90 ) .",
    "such a percentage decreases down to @xmath96 if also the source 37 is not considered .",
    "we consider apart the high redshift @xmath97 source 28 that is detected to be in a dense environment at @xmath98 and @xmath99 significance levels by the p08 method and by the ppm method , respectively .",
    "even if such a redshift is formally beyond the redshift interval ( @xmath22 ) of our interest , we do not reject the source .",
    "these results suggest that the great majority ( @xmath100 ) of our @xmath81 cluster candidates are not detected by the p08 method , while all the seven cluster candidates found with such a method are also detected by the ppm .",
    "this suggests that our method might be more effective to find cluster candidates , at least limited to our sample and dataset used .",
    "we will further discuss these results in the following section .      in the previous section we found that the great majority ( i.e. @xmath3 ) of our @xmath81 cluster candidates are not detected with the p08 method , while all of the cluster candidates detected by such a method are also found with the ppm .",
    "this is interesting , since such redshifts correspond to the range within which the p08 method is effective @xcite .",
    "although we can not fully understand the details for such a discrepancy we believe that the method might miss those overdensities that do not fulfill the specific p08 color selection .",
    "this result could also have physical implications .",
    "the p08 method searches for segregations of red @xmath101-[4.5])_{ab}$ ] galaxies . in principle , it is sensitive to both passively evolving and star - forming galaxies .",
    "however , the method might miss overdensities that are populated by a great amount of bluer galaxies than those required in order to detect the overdensity .",
    "as argued by @xcite , foreground galaxies at redshift @xmath102 have colors similar to those at redshift @xmath103 and might add noise , thus affecting the detections .",
    "furthermore , we also found that the majority of the objects that are used for the ppm and are selected within the i09 catalog are not included in the s - cosmos survey and , therefore , they are not used by the p08 method .",
    "hence , a mismatch between the p08 method and the ppm is not surprising .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the contrary , the search for cluster candidates performed in this work by adopting the ppm is based on number counts and does not rely on peculiar and specific properties ( e.g. colors of the sources ) and a specific segregation of the galaxies within the cluster core ( see also sect .",
    "[ sec : disc_frilocation ] ) .    since the p08 method is applied performing a counts - in - cell analysis , some of the clusters that are not detected by such a method might be populated by galaxies that are not completely segregated in the cluster core .",
    "interestingly , c10 suggested the presence of a high fraction of star forming galaxies in the @xmath16 cluster candidates associated with sources 03 , 05 , and 226 , on the basis of the visual inspection of the rgb images of their fields .    in a forthcoming paper we will perform the color magnitude diagrams to study the star formation activity of the galaxies in our clusters and address the problems of detecting and studying the red sequence , as well as understanding where star forming and quiescent galaxies are located within the cluster .",
    "the evidence for star formation activity in some of our clusters is not surprising , especially at @xmath4 , where cluster galaxies are expected to have ongoing or increasing star formation @xcite .",
    "in fact , in some of these high redshift clusters , a significant fraction of the cluster galaxy population is constituted by highly dust reddened sources @xcite or by blue and irregular galaxies",
    "@xcite .    from a theoretical point of view , previous studies made predictions for the mass function of galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we nevertheless note that our cluster sizes are only rough estimates or upper limits of the cluster core in the optical bands ( see also sect .",

    "this is not the number of cluster members , but simply the number of sources in the i09 catalog that are found in the field of each overdensity , around the estimated redshift of the cluster .",
    "such a number can be considered as a rough estimate of the richness of the cluster , because of both the instrumental and the ppm limitations .    in detail , the overdensities in the fields of 18 and 26 are those that have the highest number of fiducial cluster members ( i.e. @xmath162 ) .",

    "therefore , the estimated number of the fiducial cluster members varies with the cluster detection significance from @xmath165 for our cluster candidates at the highest redshifts ( @xmath16 ) to more than @xmath162 for our @xmath26 clusters candidates .",
    "this is most likely because of the overall decrease in the number count density of the cosmos survey for increasing redshifts .",

    "however , @xcite found contrasting results based on a small sample of 12 x - ray selected clusters at low - intermediate redshift ( @xmath111 ) . in particular , they suggested that low power radio sources ( down to l@xmath169  erg  s@xmath32  hz@xmath32 ) are preferentially hosted by low - mass clusters .",

    "this will improve the sample statistics and will allow us to understand if the trend is due either to evolutionary properties ( being the llrgs , on average , at lower redshifts than the hlrgs ) or to the difference in radio power between the llrgs and the hlrgs .",
    "a possibility is that such radio galaxies are hosted in underdense regions within their cluster environment . to further investigate the above scenario we visually inspected the fields of the six sources .",
    "we did not find any evidence that the non - null offsets are present because of an artificiality or a technical bias of the i09 catalog ( e.g. that some sources at the redshift of the cluster candidate and in the field of the corresponding fr  i are not included in the i09 catalog or that their redshifts are erroneously estimated ) .",
    "we also found that the galaxies in each of these fields at redshifts around that of the corresponding fr  i are homogeneously distributed around the position of the radio galaxy .",

    "<S> we search for high redshift ( @xmath01 - 2 ) galaxy clusters using low luminosity radio galaxies ( fr  i ) as beacons and our newly developed poisson probability method ( ppm ) based on photometric redshift information and galaxy number counts . </S>",
    "<S> we use a sample of 32 fr  is within the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) field from @xcite catalog . we derive a reliable subsample of 21 _ bona fide _ low luminosity radio galaxies ( llrgs ) and a subsample of 11 high luminosity radio galaxies ( hlrgs ) , on the basis of photometric redshift information and nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) radio fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> the llrgs are selected to have 1.4  ghz rest frame luminosities lower than the fiducial fr  i / fr  ii divide . </S>",
    "<S> this also allows us to estimate the comoving space density of sources with @xmath1 at @xmath2 , which strengthens the case for a strong cosmological evolution of these sources . in the fields of the llrgs and hlrgs we find </S>",
    "<S> evidence that 14 and 8 of them reside in rich groups or galaxy clusters , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus , overdensities are found around @xmath3 of the fr  is , independently of the considered subsample . </S>",
    "<S> this rate is in agreement with the fraction found for low redshift fr  is and it is significantly higher than that of fr  iis at all redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> although our method is primarily introduced for the cosmos survey , it may be applied to both present and future wide field surveys such as sdss stripe 82 , lsst , and euclid . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , cluster candidates found with our method are excellent targets for next generation space telescopes such as jwst . </S>"
