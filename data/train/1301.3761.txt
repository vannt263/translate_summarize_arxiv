    "there is a method of _ single amino acid replacement _ in natural antimicrobial peptide sequences , method of _ artificial neural network _ that had been trained for amp recognition and ranks a large set of random generated sequences and _ linguistic model _ where new antimicrobial peptides are generated based on grammatical rules derived from naturally occurring amps@xcite .",
    "despite the mentioned approaches are rather good for generation of quazirandom peptide sequences that exhibit antimicrobial activity , they do not explicitly take into account the structure of antimicrobial peptides , that is crucial for their activity and can be used in further improvement of their properties .",

    "as expected , fast process of structure formation occurred in the first 30 ns of trajectory that is expressed in the large change of rmsd from zero to roughly 1.8 nm . after 30 ns rmsd is nearly constant with fluctuation about 0.25 nm , which is the typical value for the thermal vibrations .",

    "cd measurements also show presence of minor @xmath0-helix and parallel @xmath1-sheet content that is different to md results .",

    "the mechanism of action of cationic amps is still not well understood but it is widely accepted that all antimicrobial peptides interact with bacterial membranes@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that cationic peptides have a higher affinity to lps in the membrane of the gram - negative bacteria than native divalent cations such as mg@xmath16 and ca@xmath16 , so peptides displace these cations from the negatively charged lps leading to a local disturbance in the outer membrane@xcite .",
    "this facilitates the formation of destabilized areas through which the peptide with it s hydrophobic part integrates into lipid bilayer .",
    "therefore , for the disruption of bacterial membranes the d51 peptide should first bind to the outer membrane with it hydrophilic areas .",
    "presence of the highly hydrophilic positively charged region ( on the top of fig.3(b ) ) formed by three lys residues at the c - terminus could account for high electrostatic affinity to lps .",
    "however from the spatial structure it can be seen that there is a charged residue in the hydrophobic area , which can impede further penetration of the peptide into lipid bilayer .",
    "considering obtained spatial structure and hypothetical mechanism of action of the studied peptide we propose rational modification of it s sequence .",
    "one of the most perspective permutation is to move the positively charged k residue to the n - terminus of the peptide : kflfrvasvfpaligkfkkk .",
    "this permutation leads to further separation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions that possibly can improve peptide activity against gram - negative bacteria .",
    "rational design of new antimicrobial peptides with high antibacterial activity is an important step on the way to the development of new generation antibiotics against multidrug - resistant bacteria . to date , several methods of rational design of amps exist , but all of these methods do not take into account spatial structure of peptides which is essential for their action .    in this work",
    "we applied methods of molecular dynamics simulation and circular dichroism spectroscopy to give insights into spatial structure organization and possible mechanism of action of previously designed synthetic antimicrobial peptide d51 .",
    "structural properties such as secondary structure content and hydrophobicity potential distribution on the molecular surface were determined by molecular dynamics study .",
    "the peptide was chemically synthesized and it s secondary structure was investigated by cd spectrometry , confirming our theoretical results . considering a possible mechanism of the peptide interaction with bacterial membranes a rational modification of it s structure was proposed .",
