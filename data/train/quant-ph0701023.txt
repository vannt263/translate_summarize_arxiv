    "level correlations in the semiclassical spectra of classically integrable systems have recently received a renewed attention .",
    "the most important development was the realization of the long - range nature of such correlations @xcite , which was explored for rectangular billiards . while it had been previously known that the short - range correlations are absent , the fact reflected by the poisson statistics of the nearest neighbor level spacings @xcite , the evidence for the long - range correlations was indirect , namely , through the saturation property of the spectral rigidity @xcite,@xcite . in @xcite",
    "the correlation function of the level density was obtained , which explicitly describes the long - range correlations in the energy spectrum .",
    "furthermore , in terms of an easily measured quantity , the variance of the number of levels on an energy interval was investigated and was shown to have very unusual properties .",
    "namely , for the interval width narrower than the energy scale associated with the inverse time of the shortest periodic orbit ( traversal along the smaller side of the rectangle ) , the variance equals , in the lowest approximation , to the mean number of levels in the interval , indicating the absence of correlations in level positions . for intervals wider than such energy scale ,",
    "the variance exhibits non - decaying oscillations around the `` saturation value '' with the amplitude smaller , yet parametrically comparable to the latter and with the `` period '' of the same order as the above mentioned scale ( the width of the interval at which the transition from the uncorrelated to correlated behavior occurs ) .    while such behavior of the variance had being previously predicted via a formal mathematical approach @xcite , ref .",
    "@xcite established that it is a direct consequence of the long - range correlations between energy levels .",
    "two independent analytical derivations were produced @xcite : one based on the direct use of quantum mechanical expressions for the energy levels for a particle in a box @xcite and the other based on semiclassical periodic orbit theory @xcite . within the latter , it was shown that the oscillations of the variance can be explained by just a few shortest periodic orbits .",
    "these results were confirmed numerically with the use of an ensemble averaging procedure wherein the rectangles of the same area , but varying aspect ratios , were used .",
    "the reason why the oscillations of the variance can be considered counter - intuitive is because with the increase of the interval width , and the corresponding increase of the mean number of levels , the fluctuation of the number of levels in the interval may actually decrease .",
    "it should be pointed out that the only reason that the variance does not become zero for a rectangular box is that the harmonics that correspond to the shortest periodic orbits have incommensurate frequencies and thus add incoherently@xcite . if one could find a system where variance would be dominated by a single periodic orbit harmonic , it could be near zero for certain widths of the energy interval .",
    "this would be even more counter - intuitive as statistically independent systems would produce different level structures yet the total number of levels for such intervals would be nearly the same ! in this work we report that we found just such a system - modified coulomb problem - and , in addition to examining the variance , we also show that the saturation value of the spectral rigidity @xcite exhibit quantum jumps associated with the change in the winding number ratio of radial and angular motions of periodic orbits .    in what follows ,",
    "we first discuss level correlations in the semiclassical spectrum and illustrate it by a classically integrable problem of a particle in a rectangular box @xcite .",
    "next , we give a detailed analytical description of the modified coulomb problem and derive expressions for the saturation spectral rigidity and for the level number variance using the periodic orbit theory .",
    "we then proceed with the numerical evaluation of these quantities for a model spectrum , that captures key features of our model , where we observe the quantum jumps in saturation rigidity and single - harmonic oscillations of the variance .",
    "we will consider intervals @xmath0   $ ] , @xmath1 , where the states with energies near @xmath2 have large quantum numbers and can be described semiclassically .",
    "denote by @xmath3 the cumulative number of levels ( or spectral staircase)@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is unit step function and @xmath6 labels the energy eigenstates . a universal ( flattened )  representation of the ladder data is obtained by rescaling the energy variable so as to eliminate the particular shape of the average @xmath7 from the ladder@xcite . to do this , define the new scaled _ dimensionless _ energy variable @xmath8 by @xmath9 here @xmath10 denotes the ensemble average .",
    "in particular , to a computed eigenvalue @xmath11 the value @xmath12 is assigned . since @xmath8 is a monotone function of @xmath2 @xmath13 so that the mean level density ( and the mean level spacing - with caveats explained in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is _ unity _ in the scaled variable @xmath14 since @xmath7 is used as the scaled energy axis variable in order to give the ladders an approximately @xmath15 slope , it is important to have a fair idea of its functional form for presenting the numerical data . in",
    "what follows , we will omit the `` prime '' for the scaled energy variable .",
    "since the present work concentrates on the long - range correlations in the spectrum of the eigenvalues , we will not discuss per se the distribution of nearest - neighbor level spacings , except to state that our computations for the modified coulomb problem below give the poisson statistics @xcite , as ought to be the case for a classically integrable system .",
    "for the statistics of large numbers of levels , the following standard measures will be used .",
    "the first is the spectral rigidity @xmath16 , defined in @xcite,@xcite as the best linear fit to the spectral staircase in the interval @xmath17   $ ] @xmath18   ^{2}\\right\\rangle \\label{delta3}\\ ] ] the explicit form of which is @xmath19   ^{2}-\\frac{12}{e^{4}}\\left [   \\int_{\\varepsilon -e/2}^{\\varepsilon+e/2}d\\varepsilon\\varepsilon\\mathcal{n}\\left ( \\varepsilon\\right )   \\right ]   ^{2}\\right\\rangle \\label{delta3 - 1}\\ ] ] for the number of levels @xmath20 on the interval @xmath21   $ ] @xmath22 the variance @xmath23 is another measure of the fluctuations .",
    "notice that in the flattened spectrum ( [ delta ] ) , considered here , @xmath24 .",
    "the fluctuation measures @xmath25 and @xmath16 can be expressed in terms of the correlation function of the density of levels , @xcite , @xmath26 regardless of the form of @xmath27 , for instance , @xmath28 using these relationships one can further show that @xmath25 supersedes @xmath16 via an integral relationship@xcite @xmath29    in the periodic orbit theory , the correlation function ( [ k ] ) can be expressed as a sum over classical periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "the important energy scale in the system is that associated with the period of the shortest periodic orbit @xmath30 for instance , in classically chaotic systems @xmath31 and for classically integrable systems @xmath32 @xcite . for energies",
    "@xmath33 , the levels are uncorrelated and one finds @xmath34 in the opposite limit , @xmath35 , the properties of spectral correlations are very different for the classically chaotic and classically integrable systems @xcite . for the former , they are well known and are described by random matrix theory @xcite and supersymmetric non - linear sigma model @xcite . for the latter , it was believed that they lead to the saturation rigidity given by @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the amplitudes and the periods of the periodic orbits and @xmath39 is the dimension of phase space .",
    "it turns out however , that the more precise formulae , up to the leading terms @xmath40 , are as follows : @xcite,@xcite @xmath41 \\label{delta3inf - p2}\\\\ \\sigma^{\\infty}\\left (   \\varepsilon;e\\right )    &   \\simeq\\sum_{j}\\frac { 8a_{j}^{2}}{\\hbar^{n-1}t_{j}^{2}}\\sin^{2}\\left (   \\frac{et_{j}}{2\\hbar } \\right )   = \\overline{\\sigma}^{\\infty}\\left (   \\varepsilon;e\\right )   \\left [ 1-\\frac{4}{\\hbar^{n-1}\\overline{\\sigma}^{\\infty}}\\sum_{j}\\frac{a_{j}^{2}}{t_{j}^{2}}\\cos\\left (   \\frac{et_{j}}{\\hbar}\\right )   \\right ] \\label{sigmainf - p}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 in the above equations , the superscript `` @xmath43 '' refers to `` saturation behavior '' and the overbar to averaging over the oscillations . note that both @xmath37 and @xmath38 depend explicitly on the position of the center of the interval @xmath44 .",
    "for instance , in a rectangular , with the aspect ratio of its sides @xmath45 , one finds @xcite that the periods are integers ( representing the number of retracings ) of irreducible cycles @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are coprime winding numbers  of classical periodic orbits such that @xmath50 @xmath51 being the periods of of motion along the sides @xmath52 .",
    "expressions for @xmath53 , and resulting formulae for the quantities of interest , can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the key consequences of the above results are as follows .",
    "first , the `` amplitude '' of oscillations around @xmath54 decays with the width of the interval @xmath55 .",
    "conversely , the `` amplitude '' of oscillations around @xmath56 does not decay with the increase of @xmath55 ; furthermore , this amplitude is of the order of @xmath56 .",
    "second , the amplitudes of oscillations decreases rapidly with the period of periodic orbits . in a rectangle , for instance , @xmath57 and , using eq .",
    "( [ tj ] ) , it is easy to see that just a few terms with smallest winding numbers should dominate the sums in the above equations ; this was indeed confirmed numerically @xcite .    to further appreciate these consequences , consider the contribution from a single harmonic only and compare the result with the known behavior of @xmath58 in completely uncorrelated system , in an almost rigid spectrum ( gaussian ensemble ) and completely rigid spectrum ( harmonic oscillator ) .",
    "it is convenient to consider the derivative @xmath59 , for which we find @xcite,@xcite @xmath60{ccccc } & $ \\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{\\text{uncorrelated}}{\\text{(integrable short range)}}$ & $ \\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{\\text{nearly rigid}}{\\text{(gaussian ensembles)}}$ & $ \\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{\\text{rigid}}{\\text{(harmonic oscillator)}}$ & $ \\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{\\text{oscillatory}}{\\text{(integrable long range)}}$\\\\ $ \\frac{\\partial\\sigma^{\\infty}\\left (   \\varepsilon;e\\right )   } { \\partial e}\\propto$ & $ 1 $ & $ e^{-1}$ & $ 0 $ & $ \\frac{4e}{\\hbar^{n-2}}\\sum _ { j\\text{:short}}\\frac{a_{j}^{2}}{t_{j}}\\sin\\left (   \\frac{et_{j}}{\\hbar } \\right )   $ \\end{tabular } \\ \\ ] ] where the summation is limited to the few shortest periodic orbits ( and the corresponding harmonics ) .",
    "clearly , depending on the interval width @xmath55 , the oscillatory @xmath58 exhibits the range of behaviors , from uncorrelated to rigid .",
    "moreover , @xmath61 can become _ negative _ , implying a seemingly paradoxical result where the fluctuation of the number of levels decreases as the average interval width ( and the mean number of levels ) increases .",
    "finally , because the frequencies of harmonics are incommensurate , @xmath58 ordinarily does not reach zero ; it oscillates between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , each typically of order of @xmath64 parametrically ( for a particle in the box see @xcite ) .",
    "however , if one can find a system where the shortest periodic orbit @xmath65 dominates the sum , @xmath58 can be reduced , as per eqs .",
    "( [ sigmainf - p]-[delta3sigmainfav - p ] ) , to @xmath66 and can become effectively zero for @xmath67 .",
    "the same effect would be also achieved if the periods of other periodic orbits are integer multiples  of @xmath65 .",
    "we found such a system in a modified coulomb problem that we proceed to discuss below .",
    "we consider a particle in the central potential @xmath68 classically , the trajectory of the motion is given by @xcite @xmath69 where@xmath70 using the canonical action variables @xcite@xmath71 we can express the energy as @xmath72 and rewrite expressions for @xmath73 and @xmath74 as @xmath75 respectively .",
    "the frequencies of radial and angular motion are given by@xcite : @xmath76 where the notation @xmath77 was introduced .",
    "for any energy @xmath2 , the motion is conditionally periodic except for the following two circumstances .",
    "first , for the values of the angular momentum @xmath78 such that @xmath79 the motion becomes periodic with the periods of radial and angular motions related by @xmath80 here @xmath81 is the period of an irreducible cycle @xmath82 ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 are coprime ) , whose orbital and angular  winding numbers are , respectively , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in other words ,",
    "the orbit closes for the first time after @xmath83 periods of radial motion and @xmath84 periods of angular motion .",
    "second , from@xmath85 the motion becomes circular for @xmath78 such that @xmath86 in which case @xmath87 . from eqs .",
    "( [ gamma ] )  and ( [ ithetair ] ) the corresponding frequency is found as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is still given by ( [ omegar ] ) but , since the distance from the center remains fixed , does not have the meaning of a radial frequency .",
    "it is very important to notice that @xmath89 depends only on the energy @xmath2 , and does not depend on the angular momentum @xmath78 .",
    "as was already mentioned , at any energy @xmath2  the conditionally periodic motion becomes periodic for such values of @xmath78 that @xmath90 is rational ; these values , however , do not depend on @xmath2 , except for the constraint @xmath91 that follows from eqs .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ gamma - cir ] ) .",
    "consequently , the following picture  of the periodic orbits emerges .",
    "in addition to circular orbits , whose period @xmath92 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ omegar ] ) and ( [ gamma - cir ] ) and changes continuously as a function of energy , there are irreducible orbits such that @xmath93   + i \\label{mr}\\ ] ] where @xmath94   $ ] is the floor function and @xmath95 are integers such that @xmath83 and @xmath84 are coprime .",
    "these correspond to rational @xmath90 s ( [ gamma - wn ] ) and their period is given by @xmath96 in view of inequality ( [ gamma - lmt ] ) , new rational values of @xmath90 become possible at discrete ( quantized ) values of @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the shortest periodic orbits @xmath97   + 1\\text { , } i<\\gamma^{(cir ) } \\label{mr - min}\\ ] ] are especially important .",
    "the key observation here is that as @xmath2 increases ( @xmath98 decreases ) , the smaller values of @xmath83 become possible , with quantum jumps occurring for energies such that @xmath99 is integer .",
    "this fact will prove to be crucial in evaluation of the spectral rigidity and level number variance .",
    "finally , for either type of the periodic orbit , it can be subsequently retraced with the period of @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the number of retracings .",
    "the quantum spectrum is given by @xcite @xmath102 which clearly follows from ( [ ecanon ] ) via born - zommerfeld quantization of the action variables    @xmath103    and the second of eqs .",
    "( [ elp ] ) is the limit of large quantum numbers , @xmath104 , that in the semiclassical approximation used here .",
    "further , we make yet another approximation that concerns with the fact that the standard kepler problem ( bohr atom in the quantum limit ) is a so called `` supersymmetric '' or `` resonant '' problem @xcite .",
    "this is because the frequency of radial and angular motions coincide in the kepler ( so that the motion is periodic ) , which is indicative of extra symmetry in the problem , as well as additional conserved quantities - runge - lenz vector in the present case . in the bohr atom , the latter",
    "is associated with the @xmath105-fold degeneracy of the @xmath101 s energy eigenstate .",
    "conversely , in a `` generic '' ( non - resonant ) integrable system , the motion is ordinarily conditionally periodic , except for specific values of certain parameters upon which the motion may become periodic .",
    "thus , in order to achieve the greatest possible difference with the standard kepler problem , a large parameter @xmath106 must be considered in ( [ v - r ] ) .",
    "accordingly , we assume that the condition @xmath107 holds , where @xmath108 is the bohr radius , that is @xmath109 .",
    "this condition translates , as follows form ( [ elp ] ) , to that of the quantum numbers @xmath73 , @xmath110 being limited from above which , combined with the semiclassical approximation , yields    @xmath111    using ( [ constraint ] ) to expand eq .",
    "( [ elp ] ) , we obtain @xmath112 and , with a substitution , @xmath113 we find @xmath114 classically , the condition corresponding to ( [ constraint ] ) would be @xmath115 leading to @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 @xmath119 are now dimensionless .    obviously , in both quantum and classical circumstances , @xmath120 in the zeroth order .",
    "the latter leads to simplified formulas for the frequencies since in this approximation @xmath121 and , from eqs .",
    "( [ gamma - cir ] ) and ( [ e - exp]),@xmath122 as follows from ( [ epsli ] ) .    due to the linear relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath123 in ( [ elp - exp ] ) , spectral properties of the two are identical . consequently , in what follows , it is spectrum ( [ epslp ] ) that is studied numerically .",
    "similarly to the rectangle , where ensemble averaging was understood in terms of variations of the rectangle s aspect ratio @xcite , here ensemble averaging is understood in terms of the variations of @xmath106 .",
    "flattening of the spectrum is achieved via ( [ epsilon_reduced ] ) with @xmath124 which follows immediately from eqs .",
    "( [ cn ] ) and ( [ epslp ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to starting with the scaled hamiltonian @xmath125 for which @xmath126 in what follows , we will drop subscript `` @xmath127 . ''",
    "the frequencies are now given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 obtained by solving ( [ epsilon - sc ] ) for @xmath130 .",
    "( for convenience , we carried over the notation @xmath99 )",
    "we now turn to evaluation of the level correlation function ( [ kinf - p ] ) . using the result obtained in appendix , we find @xmath131 to reduce this to the sum on @xmath83 only , we notice that from ( [ gamma - sc ] ) and ( [ mr - min ] ) , @xmath132   + 1 \\label{mr - min2}\\ ] ] second ,  for each @xmath83 , there are @xmath133   $ ] possible values of @xmath84 , and , consequently , we obtain @xmath134 \\cos\\left (   \\frac{2\\pi\\left (   \\varepsilon_{1}-\\varepsilon_{2}\\right )   m_{r}}{\\omega_{r}}\\right )   \\label{kinf - mc2}\\ ] ]    for very small @xmath135 , is possible to reduce this sum to an integral . neglecting the difference between the function and its floor , including time - reverse of each orbit , and using eqs .",
    "( [ omega - sc ] )  and ( [ gamma - sc ] ) , we find @xmath136 where @xmath137 and  @xmath138 is the period of the shortest periodic orbit .",
    "this is in complete analogy to the approximate form of the correlation function found for a rectangular box@xcite where the @xmath139-function term corresponds to the absence of level correlations and the second term the onset of thereof .",
    "similarly , saturation spectral rigidity ( [ delta3sigmainfav - p ] ) is given by @xmath140   \\frac{1}{m_{r}^{3}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\beta}}{\\pi^{2}}\\sum_{m_{r}=2}\\left [   \\frac{m_{r}}{\\gamma^{(cir)}}\\right ]   \\frac{1}{m_{r}^{3}}\\label{delta3inf - final}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is now understood as interval width in the spectrum @xmath123 .",
    "the second equality follows from the fact that the floor function in the sum automatically takes care of summation starting with @xmath141 .    together ,",
    "( [ delta3inf - final ] ) , ( [ gamma - sc ] ) and ( [ mr - min2 ] ) transparently predict quantum jumps in saturation level rigidity . as the energy increases , @xmath142 decreases and ,",
    "as it takes on smaller integer values , a transition @xmath143 takes place leading to the jump in saturation rigidity .",
    "we observe such jumps in numerical simulations , discussed in the next section .",

    "these @xmath106 s must be sufficiently close to the central value , as to eliminate the systematic dependence on @xmath106 , yet sufficiently far to ensure proper sampling . as a first step",

    "we do not have a good explanation for this discrepancy .",
    "further , the theoretical formula predicts additional noticeable jump further up in the spectrum , when @xmath151 , which is not seen on the experimental curve .    with the same modification ( [ correction ] ) in eq .",

    "we predict analytically , and observe numerically , quantum hall like jumps of the averaged saturation level rigidity in a modified coulomb problem . these are explained semiclassically in terms of jumps in the winding numbers of the shortest periodic orbits as the position of the interval center moves through the energy spectrum .",
    "also , analytically and numerically , we predict sinusoidal oscillations of the saturation level number variance with the interval width .",
    "this is a striking result which indicates that while distribution of the levels on a interval varies greatly from sample to sample , the total number of levels in the interval may be nearly identical for certain values of the interval width .",
    "this is because all the higher harmonics are integer fractions of the shortest periodic orbit and add up coherently .",
