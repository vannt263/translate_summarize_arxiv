    "although a natural setting for a quantum mechanical system is the infinite - dimensional hilbert space , there are many circumstances when the complex projective space @xmath2 suffices to describe quantum dynamics .",
    "the most commonly known situations concern various spin systems when spatial and spin degrees of freedom are sufficiently decoupled and we are interested only in the evolution of the latter . in such cases , however , the notion of the classical limit rarely makes sense , or , at least , is not immediately obvious .",
    "there are , however , quantum systems living in finite - dimensional hilbert spaces ( or , more correctly , their projectivisations ) , for which a construction of a classical limit is sensible and conceptually simple .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath3 atoms interacting resonantly with electromagnetic radiation .",
    "resonance conditions usually ensure that only a finite number @xmath4 of energy levels of each atom is effectively excited by the interactions .",
    "the operators @xmath5 describing transitions from the level @xmath6 to the level @xmath7 of a single atom , after multiplying by the imaginary unit @xmath8 , span the defining representation of @xmath9 . for a system of @xmath3 atoms confined to a small volume - so small that they feel the same field amplitude -",
    "it is convenient to introduce collective operators @xmath10 where @xmath11 acts as @xmath12 on the levels of the @xmath13-th atom and as the identity on the rest .",
    "if the atoms do not interact , the dynamics of the system can be described only in terms of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and their couplings to the electromagnetic field .",
    "it is clear that , again up to the multiplication by @xmath8 , @xmath14 , obeying the same commutation relations as @xmath12 , i.e.@xmath16=\\delta_{ml}s_{kn}-\\delta_{kn}s_{ml}$ ] , span a ( in general reducible ) @xmath17-dimensional representation of @xmath9 . in a typical situation",
    "the number of atoms is conserved and we can restrict our attention to @xmath18 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the operator @xmath19 , counting the number of atoms , is a constant of motion .",
    "the above described example can be used to illustrate the main topic of the present paper - a kind of classical limit for a quantum system appearing when the number of its constituents ( in our case atoms ) is very large and we are interested in such quantities like e.g.  energy or polarization per one atom .",
    "such a situation in which we formally put @xmath20 is common in constructing semiclassical theory of lasers ( for a particular example where such an approach to the classical limit was applied to the so called superradiant laser in which the active medium consisted of three - level atoms see @xcite ) . in the limit",
    "we expect quantum operators constructed from the generators @xmath14 , after scaling by the number of atoms , to be mapped into functions defined on a classical phase space . by the classical phase space we understand an appropriate symplectic manifold determined by the problem in question .",
    "moreover , to have an unambiguous connection between quantum and classical dynamics , we demand the dirac connection between commutators and poisson brackets : the classical limit of the commutator of two operators should be proportional to the poisson bracket of the corresponding classical limits of the operators involved .",
    "such a connection assures that the classical dynamics will be obtained by applying classical limit procedure to the quantum ( heisenberg ) dynamics .    in @xcite",
    "a detailed analysis of the problem in the case @xmath21 was presented .",
    "the classical limit was constructed with the help of coherent states for the group @xmath22 .",
    "( the complexification of @xmath22 , i.e.  @xmath23 has , as its lie algebra @xmath24 , generators of which appeared above as relevant operators in the case of systems of three - level atoms ) .",
    "the classical limit was obtained by taking appropriately scaled expectation values of quantum operators in the coherent states and going to infinity with the dimension of representation . on the manifold of the coherent states there",
    "exists a natural symplectic structure which , in the classical limit , gives the classical canonical structure . in the above construction we still have a freedom to choose the way we go to infinity with the dimension of representation .",
    "obviously the actual way must be decided upon the actual physical problem in question .",
    "thus , for example in the above mentioned case of multilevel atoms , we may consider a situation when initially the system is prepared in the ground state , independently on the number of atoms involved .",
    "such a choice determines for each number of atoms a particular irreducible representation .",
    "increasing now the number of atoms we approach the classical limit via a particular sequence of irreducible representations .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the choice of the way to the classical limit may have measurable consequences . in the considered case of many three level systems",
    "there are at least two natural ways in which the classical classical limit is achieved .",
    "the integrability properties of the system , as well as statistical properties of spectra , distinguishing chaotic and integrable system on the quantum level , were shown to depend on the way chosen , which makes the whole problem interesting and worth reconsidering in the more general setting ( see also @xcite where the non - hamiltonian classical dynamics appropriate for the superradiant laser is analyzed ) .",
    "the present paper generalizes the above ideas to an arbitrary compact semisimple lie group @xmath25 .",
    "we do not use explicitly the concept of coherent states - a crucial element of the papers @xcite and @xcite , choosing a more straightforward way of identifying classical phase space with an appropriate orbit of the group and obtaining the classical function with the help of the moment map .",
    "the whole construction is , however , completely equivalent to the one using coherent states .",
    "the crucial point consists of extending the straightforward procedure of obtaining classical limit for generators of the lie algebra of @xmath26 to operators which are polynomials in the generators , as these appear in a natural way in nontrivial quantum systems .",
    "we chose to treat such operators as elements of the full tensor algebra @xmath27 of the lie algebra @xmath28 of @xmath26 .",
    "we show how they are represented as differential operators , obtainable from the differential operators for the generators , and how to perform the classical limit of them .",
    "we give formulae useful for an arbitrary compact semisimple group which allow the explicit calculation of classical limits for different sequences of representations .",
    "the most important application we had in mind is the above outlined generalization from three - level systems to ones with @xmath4 levels . in this case",
    "@xmath29 but , obviously , the generality of the construction gives a possibility to analyze systems with an arbitrary compact , semisimple group of symmetries . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we shall apply the construction to the above mentioned problem of spectral statistics of quantum evolution operators for classically integrable and non - integrable systems .",
    "the two following sections of the paper give necessary definitions , conventions and short description of properties of the momentum map for a compact group action on a symplectic manifold ( section  [ momentum ] ) and some basic facts from the theory of representations for compact groups ( section  [ representations ] .",
    "sections  [ limit1 ] and [ limit2 ] give a description of what is meant by a classical limit .",
    "the main results are contained in section  [ main ] , where we give the formulae for calculating classical limit for an arbitrary lie group , generalizing results obtained in @xcite . a detailed proof of an important theorem concerning the factorization of the norm function on the orbits using methods of complex algebraic geometry , is given in the appendix .",
    "we start this section with the definition of momentum maps which will be used in the sequel to construct the classical limit by representation theoretic methods .    in the simplest example of the system of free particles in @xmath30 the momentum map assigns to each particle with a generalized momentum @xmath31 at a point @xmath32 in configuration space the negative of its momentum , i.e.  @xmath33 , providing thus a map defined on the phase space .",
    "we shall see in the sequel that its codomain is more interesting .",
    "since it is a good convention , let us call this map @xmath13 .",
    "the configuration phase space of the free particles system has translational symmetry , so we have a natural action of the additive group of real 3-tuples , i.e. @xmath30 , by translation in configuration space .",
    "the ordinary momentum of a particle is a point in the tangent bundle , i.e. a tangent vector .",
    "now we can view such a tangent vector as an infinitesimal generator of the group @xmath30 , i.e. an element of the abelian lie algebra @xmath30 .",
    "since generalized momenta are cotangent vectors , the momentum map @xmath13 can be thought of as a map @xmath34 let us discuss the abstract definition of momentum map first .",
    "we start with a phase space @xmath35 being a smooth manifold @xmath4 with a symplectic form @xmath36 .",
    "a hamiltonian vector field @xmath37 on @xmath4 is by definition a vector field which is induced by a smooth function @xmath38 , sometimes called the hamiltonian function , in such a way that the contraction of the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 is the differential of @xmath38 : @xmath39 now let us consider a connected lie group @xmath40 of symmetries acting on @xmath4 @xmath41 from the left .",
    "in order to be a group of symmetries , @xmath40 has to act via canonical transformations or symplectic diffeomorphisms , i.e. for every @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the pullback by the group action ( [ gaction ] ) . in short words",
    "it simply means that the symplectic structure on @xmath4 is invariant with respect to the action of @xmath40 .    what happens to the lie algebra @xmath28 of @xmath40 here ?",
    "every @xmath45 induces a flow via @xmath46 , which is the flow of some vector field @xmath47 on @xmath4 .",
    "the formula for @xmath47 applied to a smooth function @xmath48 reads @xmath49 which makes @xmath50 a map @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the set of smooth vector fields on @xmath4 .",
    "we adopted here the sign convention which is natural for the left action , otherwise we could choose to act on @xmath4 from the right and dispose the minus sign here .",
    "being a connected lie group of symmetries @xmath53 is equivalent to @xmath54 where , as customary , we denote by @xmath55 the lie derivative along @xmath56 . by cartan s formula",
    "we see that @xmath57 and @xmath58 , because @xmath36 as a symplectic form is closed by definition .",
    "so , @xmath59 means that - at least locally - for every @xmath60 there exists a function @xmath61 , such that by poincar lemma @xmath62 let us take a closer look at the situation , pretending everything is defined globally . for every @xmath60 we have a map @xmath63 so we get , by choosing a @xmath61 for each @xmath60 , a map @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the space dual to @xmath28",
    ".    one might wonder why @xmath61 should be linear in @xmath60 , but since @xmath66 is a linear condition , it is always possible to choose @xmath61 in such a way .",
    "the choice is still a non - unique one here , because we can add any linear form @xmath67 to @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath69 is also a hamiltonian function to the vector field @xmath47 .    to reduce this non - uniqueness and at the same time make a connection to the group action",
    ", @xmath13 should be equivariant with respect to the coadjoint action on @xmath65 @xmath70 where the coadjoint action is given by @xmath71 thus , let us formulate the following definition    let @xmath35 be a symplectic manifold with a lie group action @xmath72 by symplectic diffeomorphisms .",
    "a momentum map is a smooth map @xmath73 , which is equivariant and satisfies @xmath74    by a straightforward calculation using the flow @xmath46 one can immediately prove that the equivariance property of @xmath13 is equivalent to @xmath61 being a lie algebra homomorphism , i.e. @xmath75 } = \\{\\mu^{\\xi_1 } , \\mu^{\\xi_2 } \\}.\\ ] ] we proceed to the next section , in which we will give an explicit formula for the momentum map in our case .",
    "since our quantum mechanical systems are given by irreducible representation spaces of compact lie groups , we should try to understand , at least roughly , how the representation theory works .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 be a compact connected lie group .",
    "since later it will appear to be necessary , let us assume from the beginning that @xmath25 is semisimple . by the famous theorem of peter and weyl @xcite , we can think of @xmath25 as a matrix group , more precisely @xmath25 is isomorphic to a subgroup of some unitary group @xmath76 .",
    "the representation theory for @xmath25 relies heavily on the existence of maximal tori , i.e.  maximal , connected , abelian subgroups of @xmath25 .",
    "so from now on , we consider @xmath25 as a group of matrices with a fixed maximal torus @xmath77 .",
    "we shall denote the lie algebra of t by @xmath78 and the lie algebra of @xmath25 by @xmath79 .",
    "assume we have an irreducible , unitary representation @xmath80 of @xmath25 on some finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath81 .",
    "certainly we can split @xmath81 up into irreducible subspaces with respect to the @xmath77- representation : @xmath82 the @xmath83 are necessarily one - dimensional , because @xmath77 is abelian .",
    "so @xmath77 acts on these one - dimensional subspaces by multiplication with complex numbers of norm one .",
    "these representations are called the exponentiated weights of @xmath80 and are given by group homomorphisms @xmath84 .",
    "if we take the differential , we get a lie algebra morphism @xmath85 .",
    "a good convention is to scale @xmath86 a bit differently and consider the maps @xmath87 .",
    "these maps can be viewed as elements in the dual of the lie algebra @xmath88 of @xmath78 and we call them the weights of the representation .",
    "to summarize , every irreducible unitary representation @xmath80 of k gives a sequence of points ( infinitesimal weights ) in @xmath88 .",
    "since we do not want to go through all the details , let us just say that depending on some choice of ordering , we get a convex cone in @xmath88 , usually called the weyl chamber , and that we can identify every irreducible , unitary representation by the so called highest weight , which are called ( analytic ) integral forms .",
    "this is reasonable for a complete treatment of the matter , but not necessary in this paper . ] in this weyl chamber in @xmath88 , relatively to the chosen ordering .",
    "this fact is called the theorem of the highest weight and is due to hermann weyl .",
    "the set of the highest weights gives therefore a complete system of all irreducible representations up to equivalence .",
    "moreover , there is a natural algebraic structure on the set of highest weights ( namely it is an additive submonoid of the additive group @xmath88 generated by a finite number of so - called fundamental weights ) - every highest weight has a unique representation as a linear combination @xmath89 with generators @xmath90 and natural numbers @xmath91 .",
    "@xcite chap .",
    "vi and @xcite theorem 5.5 )    for illustration consider the following picture of the highest weights of @xmath92 written in the coordinates @xmath93 :    now we want to connect this to the momentum maps discussed earlier . to this end",
    "we embed @xmath88 into @xmath94 ( the dual of @xmath79 ) , with respect to the killing form on @xmath79 .",
    "more formally , we identify @xmath79 with @xmath94 and have the inclusion of @xmath88 , if we extend every @xmath95 to @xmath96 by 0 on @xmath97 .    using this identification , we can talk about @xmath25-orbits through @xmath98 .",
    "in particular we look at the coadjoint orbits through the highest weights .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the highest weight of a representation has multiplicity one , i.e. there is only a one - dimensional subspace @xmath99 , such that @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the highest weight . a vector @xmath103 in @xmath99",
    "is called a maximal weight vector .    here",
    "we encounter the basic fact :    let @xmath104 be an irreducible , unitary representation with the highest weight @xmath105 , then we have a momentum map @xmath106 ) = -2 i \\frac{\\langle x , d_e \\varrho ( \\xi ) .x \\rangle}{\\langle x , x    \\rangle}$ ] and @xmath107 ) = \\lambda$ ] . moreover @xmath13 is a symplectic diffeomorphism between @xmath108 $ ] with the natural symplectic form and @xmath109 with the kostant - kirillov form ( which is the natural symplectic structure on it ) .",
    "the proof that @xmath13 is a momentum map can be found in @xcite chapter vi.7 .",
    "the proof that @xmath107 ) = \\lambda$ ] , as well as of the rest of the statement , is given in chapter v ( theorem 7.2 ) of the same reference .",
    "the natural symplectic form of the @xmath110 is the one induced by the fubini - study metric , i.e.  which is the imaginary part of the hermitian metric in @xmath111 given by @xmath112 pushed down to @xmath110 .    a detailed description of kostant - kirillov form it is not important for the rest of the paper .",
    "we are more interested in restating the theorem in the following way : to every irreducible unitary representation we find a symplectic manifold @xmath4 ( the orbit @xmath108 $ ] ) and a map @xmath113 , which is a lie algebra homomorphism , i.e. @xmath114 ) = \\mu^{[\\xi , \\eta ] } = \\{\\mu^{\\xi } , \\mu^{\\eta } \\}.\\ ] ] this is almost a quantization procedure .",
    "we now have a connection between some skew - selfadjoint operators in the image of @xmath115 and classical functions on some symplectic manifold .",
    "we would like , however , to have such a construction for self - adjoint operators appearing in a natural way as observables in quantum mechanics .",
    "clearly , multiplying by @xmath8 makes a skew - selfadjoint operator selfadjoint and vice versa .",
    "so let us consider the operators @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "we get @xmath118 = - [ a , b]\\ ] ] and @xmath119 we define our classical limit @xmath120 by @xmath121 thus we get the relation @xmath122 ) = \\{{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{cl } } } ( a ) , { \\ensuremath{\\operatorname{cl } } } ( b)\\},\\ ] ] which is , modulo the constant @xmath123 , the well known dirac quantization scheme we wanted to have as explained in the introduction .",
    "our classical limit has a major drawback .",
    "it is only defined for those self - adjoint operators which are in the image of the representation @xmath124 multiplied by @xmath8 .",
    "we would like to find a classical limit for the system , starting with a fixed representation @xmath80 on @xmath81 and some arbitrary self - adjoint operator on @xmath81 .",
    "every continuous , irreducible , unitary representation @xmath80 of @xmath25 gives a _ holomorphic _ representation of the complexification @xmath125 , which we call @xmath80 as well . by taking the derivative we get a representation @xmath126",
    "this has a unique extension to the full tensor algebra @xmath127 of @xmath28 , by multiplying the images of generators in @xmath128 .",
    "the famous lemma of burnside says that every operator in @xmath128 is in the image of this representation on @xmath81 , cf .",
    "this is good and bad in some ways .",
    "good , because we may find a way to generalize our classic limit by algebraic methods , but bad because the procedure is not unique at all .",
    "the non - uniqueness results from the fact that the ideal generated by the relation @xmath129 $ ] for @xmath130 is in the kernel of every @xmath131 .",
    "even if we divided by this ideal , the resulting algebra @xmath132 , called the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath28 , would be infinite dimensional , so we would have a far greater kernel .    to illustrate this consider for example the image of a nilpotent element @xmath133 in @xmath28 . in every representation",
    "it is mapped to a nilpotent operator .",
    "so let @xmath134 be the matrix representing @xmath133 in some suitable basis for a given representation , such that @xmath134 is a matrix with zero on and below the diagonal .",
    "then we will find some @xmath135 , such that @xmath136 .",
    "this means @xmath137 is in the kernel of this representation .",
    "so , we can add @xmath137 to any operator in @xmath138 , without changing the image of the representation of this operator .    to overcome this ,",
    "we need a notion of hermiticity on @xmath138 and define everything for these abstract operators independently of the chosen representation .",
    "let @xmath79 be the lie algebra of a compact , simple lie group and @xmath139 be its complexification .",
    "we define the formal adjoint operation @xmath140 by    @xmath141    @xmath142 for every @xmath143    @xmath144 for every @xmath145    @xmath146    and and extend this definition to @xmath138 by linearity with respect to @xmath147 .",
    "we call an element @xmath148 abstractly selfadjoint , if @xmath149",
    ".    note that the formal adjoint is not complex linear , because it contains the complex conjugation on the scalars in point 1 .    by the very definition",
    "an abstractly selfadjoint element is mapped to a selfadjoint operator by the extended derivative @xmath150 of every irreducible unitary representation @xmath151 .    to overcome this we start with a general , abstractly selfadjoint element @xmath37 in @xmath138 , which we call the abstract hamiltonian of the system .",
    "let us choose some basis @xmath152 of @xmath28 .",
    "we can decompose @xmath37 uniquely into homogeneous terms consisting of sums of `` monomials '' @xmath153 for some indices @xmath154 .",

    "the resulting classical limit @xmath157 is physically well - behaving , because if we take only unit vectors in @xmath99 , than @xmath158 which means that the expectation value of the operator @xmath159 is given by the product of the expectation values @xmath160 and @xmath161 , i.e.  in the classical limit @xmath160 and @xmath161 are stochastically independent operators .",
    "this is pretty unspectacular , because it was just defined to be this way , and we would really like so see this definition in the light of some limiting process , sending @xmath162 .",
    "a proposal how to do this is given in one case by direct calculation in @xcite , which we will discuss in the next chapter in general .",
    "the reader may wonder why we do not choose the universal enveloping algebra @xmath132 as starting point .",

    "we have @xmath165 = \\xi_1 \\xi_2 - \\xi_2 \\xi_1 $ ] .",
    "the classical limit of the right hand side would be necessarily 0 , because multiplication of functions is commutative , but the left hand side is just the classical limit of @xmath60 , which is not 0 .",
    "therefore we can not take @xmath166 as the basic algebra of our construction .",
    "so far we have a generalized classical limit defined on `` monomials '' @xmath167 and extended by linearity .",
    "we want to realize this limit by a limiting process , i.e.  to have some sequence of @xmath168-functions converging uniformly on compact sets to the classical limit of the `` monomial '' .",
    "our basic idea is that we should go to infinity along lines through the weyl chamber by which we mean the following .",
    "assume we start in a fixed point @xmath105 in the weyl chamber , which is the highest weight of some irreducible , unitary representation @xmath80 .",
    "let us consider the discrete line @xmath169 in @xmath88 for @xmath135 .",
    "it is again a standard fact - a corollary of the highest weight theorem - that each @xmath170 is a highest weight of an irreducible , unitary representation @xmath171 , such that for @xmath172 all orbits @xmath173 are diffeomorphic to each other .",
    "moreover the isotropy subgroup is the same for every @xmath174 and the diffeomorphisms are given by scalar multiplications .",
    "the dimension of the irreducible representation is given by ( cf .",

    "we need a little more details about the structure of @xmath28 now .",
    "let us consider the adjoint representation of @xmath40 on @xmath28 .",
    "we can surely decompose it into the one - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath77 .",
    "this leads to points in @xmath88 as described in section 3 .",
    "they are in general called the weights of the representation , but since the adjoint representation is so fundamental , its weights have a special name - they are called the roots of the @xmath40 . for every root @xmath133 we find a one dimensional subspace of @xmath28 called the root space to @xmath133 and denoted by @xmath178 .",
    "the before mentioned ordering on @xmath88 gives a notion of positivity on the set of roots , i.e.  we can decompose @xmath28 in the following way @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 are lie algebras . in a good ordering of weights we can think of the matrices in @xmath182  as lower ( upper ) triangular matrices with zero diagonal and @xmath183 as diagonal matrices .",
    "the group @xmath184 is biholomorphic to @xmath185 , because @xmath186 is a diffeomorphism here .",
    "analogously , we define @xmath187 . for the moment",
