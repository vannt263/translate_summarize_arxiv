    "since the strong coupling constant , @xmath12 , is not very different at the @xmath9 and @xmath1 masses , it is expected that the @xmath9 and @xmath1 branching fractions of any exclusive hadronic state @xmath10 are related by @xmath13 this relation defines the `` @xmath14 rule '' , which works reasonably well for many specific decay modes .",
