    "the low - mass protostellar source iras 16293 - 2422 ( hereafter i16293 ) is located in the @xmath2  ophiuchus cloud complex at a distance 160 pc from the sun .",
    "high angular - resolution observations revealed that i16293 is also a protobinary system of two components with a projected separation of @xmath35.2  ( @xmath3840 au ) , and 3-mm continuum observations @xcite suggest that the northwest component ( 0.61 m@xmath4 , hereafter i16293b ) is slightly more massive than the southeast component ( 0.49 m@xmath4 , hereafter i16293a ) .",
    "single - dish submillimeter line - surveys led @xcite to conclude that , within a 20  region , i16293 consists of a cold ( t@xmath5 10@xmath620 k ) outer molecular envelope , a warmer ( t@xmath5 40 k ) circumbinary envelope of 10@xmath615  in size , and a hot ( t@xmath7 80 k ) region of dense gas only 3@xmath610  in size .",
    "this innermost gas was found to be rich in organic molecules and it was suggested that their presence was due to outflows @xcite interacting with the circumbinary envelope .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the emitting region is warm ( 100 k ) , dense @xmath8 , and very compact ( @xmath32@xmath63 ) .",
    "this led to the suggestion that i16293 contained a _ hot molecular core _ about 150 au in size where high dust temperatures ( t@xmath9 100 k ) can facilitate the evaporation of icy grain mantles @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is supported by recent observations which show that i16293 _ inner _ hot core has a molecular inventory rich in complex molecules , similar to the hot molecular cores ( hmcs ) associated with massive protostars @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , several questions remain that can not easily be answered by single - dish observations .",
    "one major concern is that its inferred size of @xmath3150 au ( @xmath1  1 ) @xcite is much smaller than the binary separation in i16293 , and comparable to the dimensions of protostellar disks .",
    "furthermore , it is unknown whether high resolution observations of low - mass hot cores will exhibit clear chemical differentiation on small spatial scales , similar to that seen in massive hmcs @xcite .",
    "submillimeter array observations with arcsecond resolution ( 1=160 au ) were carried out on 2003 march 14 ( compact configuration ) and july 12 ( extended configuration ) with 5 antennae .",
    "the phase tracking center of the observations was @xmath10(j2000 ) = 16@xmath11.91 , @xmath12(j2000 ) = -242835.52 .",
    "the digital correlator at the time was configured with eight overlapping segments ( `` chunks '' ) each of 104 mhz bandwidth and 128 channels , except one chunk which had 512 channels , giving a frequency resolution of 0.812 and 0.203 mhz , respectively .",
    "the total bandwidth of each sideband was @xmath3670 mhz covering two frequency ranges : 343.555@xmath6344.225 ghz ( lsb ) and 354.211@xmath6354.881 ghz ( usb ) .",
    "quasars 1743 - 038 and nrao530 were observed for phase and amplitude calibration .",
    "the flux scale is estimated to be accurate to 25% .",
    "the synthesized beam sizes are @xmath31.3@xmath132.7 at 344 ghz and @xmath31.1@xmath132.5 at 354 ghz with natural weighting ; these beams correspond to a linear scale of @xmath3200@xmath13400 au at a distance of 160 pc .",
    "the data were calibrated using the mir software , and imaging was done with miriad software .",
    "to make positive identifications of the spectral features detected , in addition to the basic requirement of frequency coincidence , an iterative process with the following stringent selection criteria was applied to each candidate species : 1 ) .",
    "expected line intensity - unfavorably weak transitions were rejected .",
    "2 ) . looking for transitions with similar or stronger line intensities in the bands - if missing , the particular candidate line was excluded .",
    "3 ) . looking for slightly less favored transitions of the same molecule for a possible sign of low - level ( @xmath14 3-@xmath15 ) `` detections '' if no other stronger transitions predicted were available in the bands .",
    "this would be an indirect verification of the particular line identified .",
    "literature check against lists of known molecules in i16293 in the literature - not mandatory for a detection as sma is sensitive to dense hot cores .",
    "5 ) . making the requirement that the molecular candidate has to be a known hot core molecule .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] lists some of the representative molecular transitions detected .",
    "the lsr velocity of each molecular line measured is also listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "single - dish observations reveal that the lsr velocity of i16293 is centered at 3.9 to 4.2 km s@xmath16 and is often found within the range of 3.3@xmath64.7 km s@xmath16 .",
    "asymmetric double - peak line profiles with the blueshifted peak at 2.5@xmath63.5 km s@xmath16 and the red one at 5.0@xmath66.0 km s@xmath16 are readily seen in single - dish observations . on the other hand ,",
    "an interferometer like the sma can easily filter out the diffuse ambient cloud , such as the warm gas envelope of i16293 at v@xmath17 @xmath33.9@xmath64.2 km s@xmath16 , and its small beam will tend to pick up the fine kinematic details of dense hot regions . the sma beam is small enough to resolve the two protobinary components in i16293 , thus sma is able to trace individual velocity component in the rotating disks and/or hot cores . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]@xmath18 , the two protobinary components are clearly resolved in the continuum emission .",
    "sample images of five organic molecules are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1]_b - f_. fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the sample spectra of four large organic molecules plus hc@xmath19n in i16293a and i16293b . by examining hc@xmath19n emission toward i16293a , two major velocity components , one at 1.7 km s@xmath16 and the other at 4.7 km",
    "s@xmath16 were seen ( fig .",
    "2@xmath18 ) ; in i16293b , one component at 2.5 and the other at 6.0 km s@xmath16 were also exhibited ( fig .",
    "2@xmath20 ) .",
    "furthermore , the small beam of an array suffers less beam dilution , thus is sensitive to high - velocity components within compact sources . in the case of hcn 4@xmath63 and hc@xmath19n , for example , linewidths @xmath218",
    "km s@xmath16 are seen toward i16293a .",
    "the hcooch@xmath0 line in i16293a is also fairly wide , with a linewidth of @xmath38 km s@xmath16 ( fig .  [ fig2]@xmath22 ) .",
    "the large linewidth ( 5@xmath68 km s@xmath16 ) is common for simple molecules like hcn , or strong molecular emission like hc@xmath0n and ch@xmath0oh . for weaker emission ,",
    "typical linewidths are of 2@xmath64 km s@xmath16 in i16293a ; however , toward i16293b , the linewidths of most molecular lines are notably narrower , i.e. , between 2 and 4 km s@xmath16 .    because of array characteristics and sensitivity , it is not unusual that an array can preferentially pick up only the stronger emission peak of a double - peak profile as seen by a single - dish .",
    "the ch@xmath0oh line shows v@xmath17 @xmath3 2.5 km s@xmath16 toward i16293a , with two velocity components visible near 4.6 and 1.8 km s@xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]@xmath23 ) .",
    "the kinematic structure traced is thus similar to what seen by hc@xmath19n ; a similar line profile of @xmath24ch@xmath0oh was also observed toward i16293a . toward i16293b ,",
    "the ch@xmath0oh emission is weaker and is mainly from the blueshifted component near 2.5 km s@xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]@xmath25 ) , which again agrees well with what was seen by hc@xmath19n .",
    "since the optically thin hc@xmath19n emission basically traced the densest regions such as the disks , it suggests methanol may also reside in the same dense regions .",
    "however , it is also plausible that the two velocity components seen in the methanol line profile are due to self absorption at @xmath33.9 km s@xmath16 . toward i16293b ,",
    "the lsr velocities of hcooch@xmath0 lines were found consistent with each other at @xmath33.9 km s@xmath16 , within the velocity uncertainty of @xmath30.7 km s@xmath16 .",
    "however , a non - trivial velocity scattering with v@xmath17 between 3.9 and 6.0 km s@xmath16 was observed toward i16293a .",
    "a close examination of the integrated intensity maps of hcooch@xmath0 show their peak emission positions are situated at @xmath30.5 east ( v@xmath17 = 3.9 km s@xmath16 ) and south ( v@xmath17 = 5.9 and 6.0 km s@xmath16 ) of the i16293a center position where v@xmath17 @xmath3 4.6 km s@xmath16 .",
    "again , such a velocity field variation traces the general velocity gradient seen by the hc@xmath19n emission nicely .",
    "all spectral emission appears to originate from two compact regions of a beam - convolved size of @xmath3200@xmath13400 au in radius , concentrated toward the two protobinary components i16293a and i16293b .",
    "an exception is the 4@xmath63 hcn transition which shows complicated kinematic structure ( takakuwa @xmath26  2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "the beam - averaged line - of - sight column densities and fractional abundances of all observed molecules are listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] , where a gas column density @xmath27 @xmath28 @xcite was adopted for both protostellar cores .",
    "column densities were measured at the peak emission positions of each integrated spectral line and were derived assuming thermalized level populations and optically thin lines . at these high densities , gas and dust",
    "are expected to be thermally well - coupled and so an excitation temperature t@xmath29 @xmath30  t@xmath31 = 100 k was adopted , except for molecular transitions with energy levels @xmath32 500 cm@xmath16 ( @xmath21700 k ) where @xmath34 = 300 k was used @xcite . for hcooch@xmath0 , with multi - line detections , the column densities were derived from rotation diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) ; we found t@xmath29 = 105 k for i16293a , and 116 k for i16293b .",
    "the assumption of t@xmath29 = 100 k applied for transitions of lower energy levels is hence warranted .",
    "the derived fractional abundances and relative column densities are in good agreement with those derived from submillimeter observations of the orion kl and sgr b2 massive hmcs @xcite .",
    "when molecular emission is mainly from the compact cores , abundances derived using the smaller sma beam can be much higher ( e.g. @xmath23-c@xmath0h@xmath35 ) than found in previous single - dish observations @xcite .",
    "this explains why ch@xmath0oh abundances derived from modeling higher energy transitions @xcite in the _ inner _",
    "i16293 core show good agreement with our values , and suggests that the lower array abundances for hcn and hcooch@xmath0 is indicative of less compact emission where the extended component is filtered out by the interferometer .",
    "the high abundances of organic molecules , particularly methanol , indicates that icy mantles have recently been evaporated @xcite . for many molecules detected in both sources ,",
    "the measured abundances only differ by factors of about 2@xmath63 ; as expected if both cores collapsed from the same cold core material .",
    "nevertheless , the apparent absence of @xmath23-c@xmath0h@xmath35 and ch@xmath35co in i16293a , if confirmed , raises the prospect that future observations could discover pronounced chemical differentiation between the two cores .",
    "we have resolved the hot cores surrounding both protostellar sources in i16293 and measured the chemical composition in each .",
    "these preliminary observations demonstrate that the sma will be an important tool to further explore the connection between the volatile organic chemical composition of the hot cores associated with massive protostars , those of solar mass , and the composition of comets .",
