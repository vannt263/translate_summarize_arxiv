    "ghost imaging is a transverse imaging modality that exploits the cross correlation between two photocurrents , arising from the detection of two distinct but highly - correlated optical beams , to image an object @xcite .",
    "one beam illuminates the object prior to detection by a single - pixel ( bucket ) detector , while the other undergoes only free - space diffraction before being detected by a high spatial resolution ( scanning pinhole or ccd camera ) detector .",
    "ghost imaging was initially demonstrated with biphoton - state light obtained from spontaneous parametric downconversion @xcite , which requires a quantum - mechanical description for its photodetection statistics .",
    "subsequent demonstrations with thermal - state light @xcite , which admits to a semiclassical interpretation of its photodetection statistics , has generated interest in applying ghost imaging to remote - sensing applications @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we developed a gaussian - state framework for the analysis of ghost imaging that provides a unified treatment of biphoton - state and thermal - state illumination  @xcite .",
    "there we also introduced a classical - state source of maximum phase - sensitive cross correlation whose ghost - imaging characteristics are most similar to those obtained with biphoton - state illumination .",
    "for all of these sources we determined the near - field and far - field image resolution they afford in lensless ghost imaging , and we quantified the low cross - correlation contrast seen with classical gaussian - state sources and the significant advantage , in this regard , that accrues from use of the biphoton state .",
    "we did not , however , address the signal - to - noise ( snr ) behavior of these ghost imagers , although we noted the relevance of having high cross - correlation contrast to achieving high snr .",
    "this relation between snr and contrast ( visibility ) has been noted in other earlier treatments of ghost imaging as well , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the low cross - correlation contrast of classical - state ghost images  which originates from the appreciable featureless background in which the desired image is embedded  is easily remedied by forming cross - covariance images , rather than cross - correlation images @xcite .",
    "this can be accomplished by ac - coupling the photocurrents into a correlator , as was done in @xcite , or by background subtraction .",
    "nevertheless , these techniques do not eliminate the noise ( shot noise and excess noise ) associated with the featureless background , which affects the integration time needed to obtain an accurate cross - covariance estimate .",
    "therefore it is important to quantify the performance of classical and quantum ghost imagers via their signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "furthermore , pursuing closed - form analytic expressions for their snrs is beneficial in identifying the most critical source and detector parameters that impact image quality .",
    "several valuable contributions have been made toward this end @xcite , but the complexity of the variance expression for the image estimate has thus far prevented a rigorous treatment of ghost - image snr behavior .    in this paper , we shall utilize our previously - developed gaussian - state framework to derive tractable analytical expressions for the snrs of three lensless ghost imagers , whose configurations are distinguished by the nature of their light sources .",
    "two use classical - state light , specifically a joint signal - reference field state that has either the maximum phase - insensitive or the maximum phase - sensitive cross correlation consistent with having a proper @xmath0 representation .",
    "the third uses nonclassical light , in particular an entangled signal - reference field state with the maximum phase - sensitive cross correlation permitted by quantum mechanics . because the low - flux , low - brightness limit of the last state reduces to vacuum plus a weak biphoton component , our analysis encompasses biphoton - state ghost imagers .",

    "consequently , the snr approaches the snr of classical ghost imaging with a bright ( phase - insensitive or phase - sensitive ) maximally - correlated broadband source , which is given in .    on the other hand , if the low - brightness condition , @xmath119 , and the low - flux condition , as given in , are both satisfied , the right - most term in the noise denominator becomes dominant , for @xmath124 , yielding @xmath134 for the broadband biphoton - state snr expression .",
    "as in the narrowband case , the snr in this regime suffers from the paucity of photon pairs detected within the photodetector s @xmath64@xmath65 integration time , which is compensated by averaging the photocurrent product over many temporal coherence bins , i.e. , employing @xmath135 .",
    "figure  [ fig_snr_bibbnf ] shows plots of for several values of @xmath130 .",
    "it is seen that the linear photon - flux dependence of the snr extends well beyond the low - flux regime .",
    "furthermore , the snr achieved in the low - brightness regime ( i.e. , ) can exceed the bright classical source asymptote given in .",
    "similar to what we found for narrowband operation , the broadband snr has a well - defined maximum achieved at finite source brightness .",
    "increasing the brightness beyond this optimal value reduces the snr , which ultimately converges to the snr attained with classical sources .",
    "all three of these snr regimes are clearly identifiable in the fig .",
    "[ fig_snr_bibbnf ] snr plots .",
    "for example , for @xmath136 , the snr is linear in photon flux until @xmath137 , its maximum occurs at @xmath138 , then the snr decreases with increasing @xmath121 until at @xmath139 it converges to the bright - source asymptote .    in the far field ( @xmath140 )",
    "the source - plane phase - sensitive cross correlation in must be propagated to the detection planes @xcite before the snr can be evaluated . for narrowband sources ( @xmath63 )",
    "we get    @xmath141}. \\label{snr : binbff}\\ ] ]    this result simplifies to @xmath142 in the low - flux ( biphoton - state ) limit , defined by , with @xmath143 , showing that narrowband biphoton - state ghost imaging snr is limited by the number of photon pairs detected within the detectors integration time . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath122 , the snr converges to @xmath144 which , as explained in the previous subsection , is equal to the bright - source snr asymptote for far - field ghost imaging with narrowband classical ( maximally - correlated ) phase - sensitive light .",
    "similar to the near - field scenarios , the snr can have a maximum at finite source brightness .",
    "the full behavior of the far - field biphoton snr in the narrowband regime is shown in fig .",

    "hence , broadband biphoton - state ghost - imaging snr is limited by the number of photon pairs detected within the detectors @xmath149 integration time .",
    "the @xmath122 snr simplifies to @xmath150 which is identical to the bright - source snr asymptote for far - field ghost imaging with broadband classical ( maximally - correlated ) phase - sensitive light .",
    "the far - field biphoton snr in the broadband regime is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_snr_bibbff ] for several @xmath130 values .",
    "all of our snr expressions are proportional to the cross - correlation averaging time @xmath38 .",
    "consequently it is meaningful to compare the averaging times required to achieve a desired snr value with different ghost imagers .",
    "let us first assume that all parameters except photon flux are equal in the configurations of interest . because the classical sources ( the thermal state and the classical phase - sensitive state ) yield identical snrs , we shall use @xmath151 to denote their photon fluxes , reserving @xmath152 for the photon flux of the maximally - entangled ( nonclassical ) state .",
    "likewise , the averaging time for the classical - state ghost imagers to achieve the desired snr will be denoted by @xmath153 , while that for the entangled - state source will be designated @xmath154 .",
    "then , in the near field and with narrowband sources we obtain @xcite @xmath155 where the classical - state sources are assumed to be bright enough to achieve the saturation snr in , but the quantum source is limited to low brightness so that the nonclassical signature of the source prevails .",
    "in the biphoton - state ( low - flux ) limit with @xmath124 , implies @xmath156 , i.e. , the cross - correlation averaging time required for narrowband biphoton - state ghost imagers to achieve a desired snr value is much longer than that for bright classical - state ghost imagers to do so , given that all other system parameters are equal .    in the near field using broadband sources we obtain @xmath157 thus , when the quantum ghost imager utilizes a low - flux ( biphoton - state ) source and @xmath124 , we find that @xmath156 prevails , i.e. , once again the cross - correlation averaging time required for ghost imaging with broadband bright classical - state light is significantly shorter than that for biphoton - state ghost imaging , given equal system parameters .",
    "nevertheless , in a very high - resolution ghost imaging configuration , high illumination flux ( @xmath158 ) may be achievable with low - brightness ( @xmath159 ) maximally - entangled phase - sensitive gaussian - state light . in this case",
    "implies that the averaging time for the nonclassical - state ghost imager can be shorter than that for the classical - state ghost imager @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath136 @xmath162 , and @xmath163 will yield @xmath164 .",
    "finally , we compare ghost imaging with a broadband biphoton - state ( low - brightness and low - flux ) to that with a bright narrowband classical state . denoting the parameters specific to the classical and quantum sources with the superscripts @xmath165 and @xmath166",
    ", we obtain @xmath167 because the last factor on the right is typically less than unity , for @xmath124 , whereas the remaining factors are greater than unity , the cross - correlation averaging time may be favor either source state . as an example , consider @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath168 , @xmath127 .",
    "then a biphoton - state source with 1thz bandwidth and a 1mhz thermal - state source will result in @xmath169 , which shows that the biphoton - state imager enjoys an enormous advantage in averaging time as compared to the classical - state imager when the quantum efficiency is not unduly low .",
    "so , ghost imaging with bright classical thermal or phase - sensitive states affords a shorter averaging time to reach a desired snr value than does a biphoton - state ghost imager , given all of the remaining parameters governing the two ghost imaging systems are equal and @xmath124 .",
    "however , ghost imaging with low - brightness , but high - flux quantum sources may achieve shorter averaging times than bright classical sources , if high quantum efficiency photon - number resolving photodetectors are employed .",
    "finally , if ghost imaging with a broadband biphoton state is compared to that with a narrowband bright classical state , the integration time may favor either source , depending on the ratio of the achievable source bandwidths , number of resolution cells in the image , and the biphoton - state source brightness .",
    "we have presented a detailed snr analysis for three gaussian - state ghost imaging configurations .",
    "two used classical - state light , specifically a joint signal - reference field state that has either the maximum phase - insensitive or the maximum phase - sensitive cross correlation consistent with having a proper @xmath0 representation .",
    "the third used nonclassical light , in particular an entangled signal - reference field state obtained from spdc , with the maximum phase - sensitive cross correlation permitted by quantum mechanics .",
    "our analysis concentrated on the narrowband and broadband limits in both the near field and the far field . because the conclusions from our analysis apply , in identical ways , to both the near - field and far - field regimes",
    ", we shall omit references to these regimes in what follows .",
    "we found that classical - state ghost imager snrs saturate  with increasing source brightness  to maximum values that are inversely proportional to the number of resolution cells on the imaged object . in this high - brightness limit",
    "the snr is thus proportional to the contrast achieved in dc - coupled operation .",
    "the contrast can be improved by removing the featureless background via ac - coupled photodetectors or background subtraction , but snr improvements , at high source brightness , require increasing the cross - correlation averaging time .",
    "biphoton - state ghost imagers were shown to have snrs that are typically proportional to their low photon flux .",
    "hence , for such imagers , increasing the photon flux of the source is of prime importance .",
    "however , the snr gain derived from such increases is not unbounded .",
    "our analysis revealed that the snr realized with a nonclassical - state source with low brightness but high flux typically has a well - defined maximum , after which increasing flux _ reduces _ the snr .",
    "the inverse relation between snr and photon flux may seem counterintuitive , but it is consistent with the fact that the snr must approach the bright classical - state snr as the source brightness increases beyond unity .",
    "this classical - state limit , however , is in general _ lower _ than the maximum snr achieved by the nonclassical - state source in the low - brightness regime .",
    "hence , in these cases , the snr achieved with nonclassical phase - sensitive light must have a decreasing trend as source brightness increases without bound .    to assess the performance achieved by different sources we compared their image acquisition times , i.e. , the cross - correlation averaging times needed to achieve a predefined target value for snr .",
    "we showed that with equal bandwidth sources , and all system parameters being equal unless otherwise noted , bright classical - state ghost imagers typically reach the desired snr value with a much shorter averaging time than that needed by a biphoton - state ghost imager .",
    "therefore , although the biphoton - state yields images with high contrast even in dc - coupled operation , because the biphoton imager is photon starved the total time duration it requires to accumulate the ghost image far exceeds that necessary with a bright classical - state source .",
    "nevertheless , we saw that there is a broadband , low - brightness , high - flux regime of nonclassical phase - sensitive light that may get by with much shorter cross - correlation averaging times than those needed by bright classical - state imagers .",
    "the notable drawback to reaping this quantum advantage , however , is the necessity for high quantum efficiency photon - number resolving detectors .    in conclusion",

    ", we have used this framework to study the snr behavior of ghost imagers with source states that encompass those that have been used in proof - of - principle ghost imaging experiments .",
    "our analysis unambiguously identifies the key parameters that limit snr behavior . for high - brightness classical - state ghost imaging it is the number of resolution cells in the image , whereas for the biphoton - state case it is the low photon flux of the source .",
