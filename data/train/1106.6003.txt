    "the search for quantum spin - liquid phases in realistic spin and electronic models and real materials remains a very active area of research . in recent years",
    "a number of experimental materials have been synthesized , whose behavior has been very promising from the point of view of discovering such a phase .",
    "these include many kagome and triangular lattice based frustrated magnets.@xcite in several cases , the frustration parameter,@xcite defined as the ratio of the curie - weiss temperature to any magnetic ordering temperature exceeds @xmath9 .",
    "most of these experimental systems show gapless spin excitations , though the role of impurities and weak anisotropies in creating gapless spin excitations has not been ruled out .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", frustration is essential for obtaining a spin - liquid phase in dimensions greater than one .",
    "unfrustrated two - dimensional spin models show robust nel order .",
    "however , both spin - frustration arising from competing exchange interactions and frustration arising from the itineracy of the electrons can lead to a spin - liquid phase . in recent years",
    "several realistic models have emerged as candidates for quantum spin - liquid ground states .",
    "one is the heisenberg model on a kagome lattice , where extensive density matrix renormalization group work by yan et al@xcite presents strong evidence for a spin - liquid phase with a not - too - small gap to singlet and triplet excitations .",
    "another is the triangular - lattice antiferromagnet with heisenberg and 4-spin ring exchanges.@xcite a third , somewhat unexpected case , is the half - filled honeycomb lattice hubbard model,@xcite which would lead to an unfrustrated heisenberg model at large u. it shows a spin - liquid phase at intermediate values of u , sandwiched between a nel phase at large u and a semi - metal phase at small @xmath10.@xcite this spin - liquid phase was also found to be gapped with no signs of any broken symmetry .",
    "exchange constants of the honeycomb - lattice heisenberg model , width=302 ]    the question of whether this latter phase can be realized in a frustrated spin model on the honeycomb lattice , arising from higher order charge exchange processes has attracted considerable interest.@xcite several recent papers have investigated this question using exact diagonalization , schwinger - boson and spin - wave theory , coupled cluster methods , and variational wavefunctions .",
    "they have come to conflicting conclusions about the phase diagram and the possible existence of a spin - liquid phase in this model.@xcite experimental realizations of spin - half honeycomb lattice heisenberg model have been discussed recently by tsirlin et al.@xcite     classical phase diagram of the honeycomb lattice heisenberg model with @xmath11 .",

    "we find a direct first order transition between nel and columnar phases as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the most interesting part of the phase diagram is for @xmath15 .",
    "we have studied this phase diagram along constant @xmath4 lines as a function of @xmath14 as well as along the contour @xmath16 .",
    "we find that at small @xmath4 the nel phase widens due to quantum fluctuations , in agreement with recent exact diagonalization study.@xcite we also find that spiral phases are stabilized for intermediate and large @xmath14 .",
    "the spiral angles are strongly renormalized with respect to their classical values .",
    "however , they do not lock into commensurate colinear structures as suggested in recent exact diagonalization study.@xcite rather , our studies favor angles closer to @xmath17 degrees , which implies spins pointing at right angles .",
    "our study also shows that a part of the phase diagram at small and intermediate @xmath4 and @xmath14 has no magnetic long range order .",
    "the convergence of our series expansion is best for colinear phases , when they have clearly non - zero order parameters .",
    "we are unable to accurately obtain the region of stability of magnetically disordered phases , but it is clear from the general analysis that such a phase must exist .",
    "this is also clearly seen by going along @xmath18 , where such a phase exists near the highly frustrated point @xmath19.@xcite it is possible that a strip of this phase extends all the way down to @xmath6 .",
    "in order to gain some insight into the nature of this phase , we have also carried out series expansions around a dimer state , which was considered as a possible ground state in ref .  .",
    "following moessner et al,@xcite such a dimer state is called a staggered dimer state .",
    "however , we found that the staggered dimer phase has rather high energy and thus is not stabilized for @xmath6 . while our study can not rule out such a phase for @xmath20 and intermediate @xmath14 , the energies again suggest that the staggered dimer state has too high an energy .",
    "this should be contrasted with studies of the square - lattice @xmath21 models , where energies of dimer - phases match smoothly with the magnetically ordered phases at intermediate @xmath7 values.@xcite it is possible that some other dimer or plaquette phase is stable here.@xcite investigation of larger unit cell dimer / plaquette phases is left for future work .",

    "however it is worth mentioning that it is convenient , for both colinear and non - colinear states , to rotate the spin axes on different sites to give an unperturbed ground state in which all spins are aligned .",

    "this transformation has the effect of complicating the form of the hamiltonian but avoids the need to identify sublattice types in the cluster data .    to derive series to a given order n requires enumeration of clusters with up to n sites .",

    ", it remains difficult to determine the nature of the magnetically disordered phases .",
    "our results are generally in good agreement with recent exact diagonalization study of albuquerque et al.@xcite one point of difference is that we do not find that a third colinear phase ( that is the spiral ii with @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) is favored over general spiral phases over any extended part of the phase diagram",
    ". this difference may be because periodic boundary conditions on finite systems may disfavor incommensurate phases .",
    "another difference with respect to the bond order mean - field theory study @xcite is that we do not find evidence for a staggered dimer phase in the magnetically disordered region at small @xmath4 .",
    "an important question is whether this magnetically disordered phase in the frustrated heisenberg models is related to the one found by meng et al@xcite in the hubbard model at intermediate @xmath55 , and whether it is a true spin - liquid .",
    "recent work by yang and schmidt@xcite found that for @xmath55 values where meng et al obtained a phase transition to a spin - liquid phase @xmath7 remains very small ( of order @xmath56 ) , with @xmath8 even smaller .",
    "this means that just these additional interactions can not drive the transition , as our study finds that these parameters are well within the nel phase .",
    "it is possible that larger ring exchanges play a role in bringing about the transition .",
    "nevertheless , the disordered phase in the heisenberg model may be connected to the one found in the hubbard model .",
