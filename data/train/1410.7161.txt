    "this is due to the fact that the remaining errors mainly stem from quantities like @xmath80 , see section [ themodel ] , and @xmath363 , see eq .",
    "( [ defxh ] ) , that were used as input .",
    "these quantities were taken from previous work and are computed by analyzing physical quantities different from the thermodynamic casimir force .    in section [ algorithm ]",
    "we discuss that the exchange cluster algorithm can be applied to a larger class of boundary conditions than simulated here . in particular enhanced surface couplings or finite surface fields",
    "could be studied .",
    "quite recently the authors of @xcite computed the thermodynamic casimir force in the presence of an external bulk field .",
    "to this end , one can compute the difference in the excess free energy per area by integrating the difference in the excess magnetisation per area over the external field @xcite , where the difference is taken for films of thickness @xmath364 and @xmath365 .",
    "the integration is started at a strong external field , where the difference in the excess free energy vanishes .",
    "alternatively , one might start at a vanishing external field , where the difference in the excess free energy per area is known from previous simulations .",
    "it seems likely that the exchange cluster algorithm allows to reduce the variance of the difference in the excess magnetisation in such studies .",
    "furthermore one could think of applications different from the thermodynamic casimir force .",
    "for example one could compute the free energy of defects .",
    "it would be interesting to check whether the simulation of spin glass models could be speeded up by exchanging spins between replica .",
    "the emphasis of our physics analysis is on @xmath0 boundary conditions .",
    "films with such boundary conditions are expected to undergo a second order phase transition in the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "this transition has been studied for the ising model on the simple cubic lattice for thicknesses up to @xmath366 in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we obtain accurate results for thicknesses up to @xmath367 using the finite size scaling approach discussed in ref .",
    "our numerical results nicely confirm the expectation that the transition belongs to the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "we compute the finite size scaling function @xmath368 , eq .  ( [ defgn ] ) , that governs the finite size scaling behavior of the free energy density in the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model for @xmath369 and @xmath370 .",
    "we show that finite @xmath3-effects in the thermodynamic casimir force , where @xmath3 is the extension of the film in the transversal directions , are described by @xmath368 . in particular using @xmath292 , our knowledge of the inverse transition temperature of the film and the numerical matching of the scaling variable , we extrapolate our results for the thermodynamic casimir force to @xmath188 .",
    "for details see section [ casimiroo ] .",
    "this approach could also be applied to other types of boundary conditions that do not break the @xmath249-symmetry of the problem , in particular to periodic boundary conditions or enhanced surface couplings that allow to study the special surface universality class .",
