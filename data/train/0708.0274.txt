    "entanglement has been considered as a fundamental issue to demarcate the border between quantum and classical physics since the earliest day of quantum theory  @xcite and is presently an essential ingredient in quantum computation @xcite . to achieve the construction of quantum computers ,",
    "there has been a surge of interest in the generation of entangled states of atoms and photons through various implements , including solid - state devices  @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance in liquid samples  @xcite , ion traps  @xcite , and atom - photon interactions in optical ( or microwave ) cavities  @xcite .",
    "being a well - studied topic in quantum optics , cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) provides a full arsenal of techniques to generate entangled atom pairs  @xcite and also entangled photon pairs  @xcite .",
    "in particular , previous studies have shown that cavity loss as well as environmental noise can help to generate entanglement and increase the success rate @xcite . however , most of these schemes referred above are probabilistic .",
    "therefore , it presents a challenging task for researchers in this field to work out a deterministic entangling scheme . with this end in view , an appealing scheme to generate maximally entangled state of two atoms inside a leaky cavity in a ",
    "quasi - deterministic \" manner has been proposed @xcite .",
    "two @xmath0-type three - level atoms , situated inside a leaky optical cavity and initially prepared in the ground state @xmath1 , interact with a single left - circularly polarized input photon . the polarization of the photon emitted from the cavity after the interaction is then measured .",
    "the atoms become maximally entangled if the emitted photon is right - circularly polarized , or otherwise remain intact .",
    "the probability of success of the entangling process is shown to approach unity if the input photon is quasi - monochromatic @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that other fundamental processes in quantum computing like quantum state - swapping and controlled phase - flip gates can also be achieved with high success rates via cqed interaction between atoms and such quasi - monochromatic single photons @xcite .",
    "needless to say , the feasibility of the scheme proposed in @xcite hinges on the availability of quasi - monochromatic single photon sources , which is an issue of current interest in its own right . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also possible to repeatedly redirect the emitted photon into the cavity till it becomes right - circularly polarized .",
    "hence , the maximally entangled state can be obtained in a quasi - deterministic way with a single photon through this feedback process @xcite .",
    "the major objective of the present paper is to study the efficiency of such a feedback process , which is crucial to its viability as , due to effects of absorption and leakage , the process will inevitably be terminated after a few rounds . in ref .",
    "@xcite the master equation approach is adopted . under the assumption that the probability of generation of entanglement in each round of the whole feedback process is a constant value @xmath2 ( @xmath3 under the optimal condition ) ,",
    "the overall success rate after @xmath4 rounds is given by @xmath5 and hence quasi - deterministic generation of entanglement is then achievable in the limit of @xmath6 .",
    "however , this crucial assumption has not been thoroughly examined in the paper .",
    "the major concern of the master equation approach used in @xcite is the evolution of atoms in the presence of cavity photons inside a leaky cavity .",
    "however , the quantum states of the incident and emitted photons are not properly considered . to provide a correct description for the incident and emitted photons , in the present paper",
    "we study the same problem using continuous frequency modes @xcite and describe the quantum states of photons in terms of their spectral functions @xcite . in the continuous frequency mode approach  @xcite ,",
    "the incident ( emitted ) photon is described by a spectral function @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , with @xmath9 being the wave number .",
    "we show that if one starts with a cavity photon , which has a spectral function @xmath10 in the form of a complex lorentzian with a width given by the leakage rate of the cavity @xcite , the probability of entanglement is @xmath11 under the optimal condition , agreeing with the result obtained in @xcite .",
    "however , owing to the interaction with the atom , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are different .",
    "the spectral function of the emitted photon is therefore no longer given by @xmath10 despite that the incident photon is a cavity photon .",
    "when the outcome of the measurement is negative , the emitted photon will be redirected into the cavity . however , as the initial state of the photon is now different , the operation can not be repeated with a constant success rate . instead , a more elaborated formulation for the overall success rate has to be sought .    using the continuous frequency mode approach ,",
    "we show in the present paper that the success rate in each round of the feedback process decreases gradually .",
    "although the probability of entanglement does approach unity in the limit of @xmath6 , the rate at which it approaches unity is much slower that predicted in ref .  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the effects of other competing loss mechanisms could become crucial in a prolonged feedback process and great caution has to be exercised in applying the feedback scheme to ensure quasi - deterministic entanglement generation .",
    "the structure of the present paper is as follows . in sect",
    "ii we introduce the system considered in the feedback process @xcite and expand the interaction hamiltonian in terms of the continuous frequency modes  @xcite . in sect .",
    "iii we show that the dynamics of the two @xmath0-atoms is reducible to that of a single @xmath0-atom and in turn obtain the spectral function of the emitted photon .",

    "[ onepn ] , the total probability of entanglement after @xmath4 rounds of operation is almost saturated after about 10 rounds and is still away from unity even after 100 rounds .",

    "we also note that the saturation phenomenon persists for another case with @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , the efficiency of the feedback scheme remains low even for a much larger interaction strength .",
    "adopting the continuous frequency mode quantization scheme , we studied the evolution of a photon under the feedback mechanism and showed that the spectral function of the photon is in general modified in each round of the feedback process .",
    "thus , the feedback scheme is not as effective as what ref .",
    "@xcite has claimed . whether the above - mentioned scheme can ensure quasi - deterministic entanglement after a large number of iterations depends crucially on the possibility of elimination of other competing processes , say , photon losses in the cavity and in the optical fibres .",
    "nevertheless , the feedback scheme could still be a useful method to improve the probability of success until other mechanisms might interfere with its operation .",
    "the aim of the feedback process proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is to ensure quasi - deterministic generation of entangled states with only one single input photon .",
    "if , instead , multiple independent cavity photons are used , the probability of success in each interaction is at best 0.5 @xcite .",
    "besides , as argued by hong and lee in ref .",
    "@xcite , for an experiment using multiple photons the finite detection efficiency of the detector @xmath118 that measures right - polarized output photons may give rise to ambiguity stated as follows .",
    "when no photon is detected by the detector @xmath118 , there are two possible cases : ( 1 ) the entanglement process has not yet succeeded , or ( 2 ) the detector @xmath118 failed to detect the output photon .",
    "the introduction of the feedback process , which has a success rate close to unity , in effect makes the detector @xmath118 redundant and eliminates the ambiguity mentioned above .    on the other hand , it is worthwhile to note the accumulative effect resulting from the difference between the spectra of the input and output photons . as demonstrated in the present paper",
    "( see fig .",
    "3 ) , the spectrum of an input photon is in general different from that of the output photon .",
    "this point is often overlooked in the conventional master equation approach to leaky cavities .",
    "if the output photon is then used as the input of a new process , such difference in the spectra might give rise to accumulative effect and harm the overall performance .",
    "needless to say , photons are ideal mediators of quantum information and can generate entanglement between well separated atoms .",
    "however , one must be conscious of the change in the spectra of a photon before and after interacting with an atom as such change might lead to marked difference in the long run .",
    "finally , we would also like to remark that the probability of success in the process examined here depends sensitively on the spectrum of the input photon .",
    "for example , instead of using cavity photons with a spectral width equal to that of the cavity , one can also consider an input photon with an arbitrary width @xmath119 , i.e. @xmath120 as shown in fig .",
    "5 , for a  quasi - monochromatic \" photon which has a sufficiently narrow spectral width , the probability of success in one single trial can be close to unity irrespective of the value of @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite suggest that quantum state - swapping and controlled phase - flip gates are achievable with high success rates with quasi - monochromatic single photons .",
    "therefore , the quantum state of single photons is likely to play a crucial role in quantum computing .",
