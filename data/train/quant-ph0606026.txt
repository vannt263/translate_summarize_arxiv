    "universal quantum computation can be performed by encoding qubits in discrete states of quantum systems and performing a set of universal quantum logic gates or unitary operations on the qubits . for the case of light ,",
    "the electromagnetic field amplitudes are described by operators that have a continuous rather than discrete spectrum .",
    "quantum information processing with continuous variables ( cv ) is thus appealing because of the possibility of optical implementation using simple linear optics elements and coherent states of light .",
    "furthermore , a cv quantum computer may be more suitable for simulating cv quantum systems . whereas much progress has been made in areas of communication , measurement and computation using optical systems  @xcite ,",
    "universal cv quantum computation with light remains a challenge due to the weakness of optical nonlinearities .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by off - line preparation of nonclassical states of light that are fed into the optical circuit at various points to generate the required strong nonlinearities .",
    "this idea was explored by knill , laflamme and milburn  @xcite and subsequently by others  @xcite for quantum computing with qubits , and by gottesman , kitaev , and preskill ( gkp ) for qudits encoded in cv systems  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of non - gaussian ancilla states of light in optical circuits as an off - line resource for generating universal gates for continuous variable quantum information processing .    for universal cv quantum information processing ,",
    "the aim is to apply a finite set of gates that , by repeated applications , will generate unitary operations corresponding to a general class of hamiltonian evolution . specifically , we are interested in hamiltonians that are arbitrary polynomial functions of the continuous variables  @xcite . in optical implementations ,",
    "combinations of linear optics and squeezing elements can generate transformations that are limited to quadratic functions of the field amplitude operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , any circuit consisting of input gaussian states and these transformations , along with homodyne detection and feed forward can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer  @xcite .",
    "this efficient simulation is due to the fact that the process can be described as a gaussian - preserving map and can be completely characterized by the evolution of the means and covariances of the initial gaussian state .",
    "this requires performing simple operations on a finite set of variables , that scales polynomially with the number of inputs  @xcite .",
    "nonlinear transformations , namely those outside the set of linear and quadratic operations , are therefore required for universal cv quantum computing - i.e. for implementing unitaries corresponding to hamiltonians that are polynomial functions of the continuous variables .",
    "one possibility is to use photon counting measurements to generate nonlinearities  @xcite .",
    "photon counting plays a key role in schemes for linear optics quantum computation using qubits  @xcite and for computation with cv - encoded qudits  @xcite .",
    "the measurements can be used to generate non - gaussian states through an ` off - line ' preparation step that is independent of the particular circuit being implemented .",
    "gkp then showed that these non - gaussian states can be employed as ancillae at different stages of ` on - line ' quantum information processing to replace the requirement for nonlinear gates .",
    "this partition of the quantum computation into off - line and on - line elements obviates the requirement for real - time photon - counting measurements that must adapt to the vagaries of each specific circuit .",
    "here we investigate and analyze off - line preparation of non - gaussian ancilla states and the employment of such ancilla states in on - line circuits .",
    "we specifically consider cubic phase states and fock states .",
    "our interest focuses on these off - line prepared states as resources for replacing the nonlinearity in order to effect universal quantum information processing .",
    "we first perform a detailed analysis of the scheme proposed by gkp for off - line preparation of a cubic phase state .",
    "we find the exact form of the state generated by the gkp scheme and show that it is a finite superposition of displaced number states .",
    "we use the fidelity as a figure of merit to assess the efficacy of preparing an ideal cubic phase state with this scheme , and present detailed studies of the wigner function for experimental parameters that take into account finite squeezing and finite detector efficiency .",
    "our analysis unfortunately indicates that current levels of squeezing are insufficient to prepare close approximations to the cubic phase state , although this limited squeezing does not necessarily rule out this approximate cubic phase state from providing an off - line resource for universal quantum information processing with gaussian operations in the on - line circuit .",
    "our results are of importance to current experimental research with squeezed light and in particular , it provides guidelines to those actively working on experimentally preparing the cubic phase state  @xcite .",
    "this work is also of relevance to recent studies of quantum computing with continuous variable cluster states  @xcite .",
    "we also consider an alternative non - gaussian state as an off - line resource for universal quantum information processing with gaussian elements in the on - line circuit , namely the ubiquitous fock state .",
    "whereas the cubic phase state is special in that it both delivers an off - line resource for universal quantum information processing with gaussian circuit elements and also makes the incorporation of the cubic phase state into the circuit simple and elegant , the fock state is also non - gaussian and perhaps the most feasible to prepare , at least for single - photon states  @xcite .",
    "since the fock state is probably the most amenable non - gaussian state to feed into a gaussian circuit as an off - line resource , it is important to assess its status as a useful off - line resource for cv computation .    in this analysis of fock state resources",
    ", we consider a gaussian - preserving circuit receiving ancillary photons .",
    "we determine the general form of non - gaussian output states that can be obtained from a gaussian - preserving circuit with an @xmath2-channel input state along with some ancillary channels , each occupied by a number state .",
    "our studies show that ancilla fock states appear to provide the requisite nonlinearity for universal cv computation , but circuit design for implementing nonlinear gates is not obvious with fock state inputs .",
    "we also include a brief discussion of efficient classical simulation of such maps by considering the classical resources required to simulate these maps .",
    "our results suggest that such maps may not be possible to simulate efficiently classically , as one would expect for non - gaussian circuits .",
    "gottesman , kitaev , and preskilll ( gkp ) define the ( unnormalized ) cubic phase state as  @xcite latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : gamma }    and propose its employment as an off - line resource for the gaussian - preserving circuit depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "here the input state is in a position ( @xmath0 ) eigenstate , which is a limiting case of displaced squeezed states , with the squeezed state given by @xmath4 is approximated for @xmath5 becoming very large and displaced by the unitary displacement operator @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "the cubic phase state , @xmath8 serves as the ancilla .",
    "the gaussian - preserving sum - inverse ( @xmath9 ) gate is defined by the inverse of @xmath10 , where the subscripts label the input and the ancilla channels respectively .",
    "the importance of the cubic phase state is that it can serve as an off - line resource for effecting a cubic phase gate , namely @xmath11 , on the input @xmath0 eigenstate using only the cubic phase state , the gaussian - preserving sum - inverse gate , a homodyne measurement of the ancilla and feedforward . after applying the @xmath9 gate and measuring the ancilla channel in the @xmath12 basis to obtain outcome @xmath13 ,",
    "the resultant output state is @xmath14 then the cubic phase gate can be effected by applying a quadratic ( i.e.  gaussian - preserving ) @xmath13-dependent hamiltonian @xmath15 which generates the unitary transformation @xmath16\\right\\}.\\ ] ] this unitary operator acting on the output state ( 4 ) yields @xmath17 .      the cubic phase gate , plus",
    "the application of linear optics and squeezing operations , homodyne measurements and feed forward , is sufficient to generate a set of gates for universal cv quantum information processing by optical means .",
    "however the ideal cubic phase state defined in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is not normalizable and therefore does not correspond to a physical state .",
    "gkp address this issue by proposing a scheme , depicted in fig .  2 , to prepare an approximation to the cubic phase state via displacement and photon counting on one channel , or mode , of a two - mode squeezed state",
    "; the other mode approximates a cubic phase state with a parameter conditioned by the photon counting measurement outcome on the other state .",
    "the two - mode squeezed state is prepared from the vacuum state by the unitary transformation @xmath18 analogous to the single - mode squeezed state explained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : squeezedstate ] ) .",
    "we analyze the scheme in detail here .",
    "consider the circuit shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we start with two input vacuum states , which then undergo two - mode squeezing @xmath19 characterized by a real squeezing parameter @xmath20 in eq .",

    "we use the generating function for the hermite gaussian ( see appendix ) so that @xmath34 as @xmath27 is a gaussian function of @xmath35 , the above integral can now be calculated . after some manipulation , the @xmath36-order derivative of this integral results in an expression for the state given by @xmath37 with @xmath38      to scrutinize the complicated state in eq .",
    "( 14 ) , we first examine the @xmath39 term of the sum in eq .  ( 14 ) . for large @xmath23 , far from the turning points , we can use a semi - classical approximation for @xmath40 ( see appendix ) . then , close to @xmath41 , if @xmath42 the @xmath39 term dominates and the state can then be approximately written as @xmath43 with @xmath44 given by eq .",
    "( 12 ) and @xmath45 .",
    "the required cubic phase term thus arises from the @xmath39 term in eq .",
    "when other terms in the sum are included , they can act to reduce the contributions of the extra linear phase term in the large @xmath30 large @xmath23 limit , thus leading to an approximate cubic phase state .",
    "we perform a numerical analysis to study the conditions for which the prepared state approaches a cubic phase state by computing the corresponding wigner function  @xcite given by @xmath46 the wigner function of the ideal cubic phase state is @xmath47^{1/3}[3\\gamma x^2 - p]\\right),\\ ] ] with @xmath48 the airy function and n a normalization factor .",
    "the airy function causes the wigner function to oscillate , resulting in @xmath49-dependent negative regions with @xmath50 ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "the wigner function of the prepared state described by eq .",
    "( 14 ) in the regime of large squeezing and large @xmath23 is a sum of the airy function of eq .  (",
    "18 ) obtained from the @xmath39 term and additional functions arising from the additional terms in eq .",
    "( 14 ) . in order to examine the contribution of these terms for a finite amount of squeezing ,",
    "we compute the wigner function of the prepared state . fig .",
    "4 shows the effect of the squeezing parameter on the negativity of the wigner function of the prepared state along the @xmath41 line for @xmath51 .",
    "the data show that , for currently achievable levels of entanglement  @xcite , the oscillations in the wigner function are strongly suppressed and the state does not closely approximate a cubic phase state .",
    "furthermore , the analysis thus far assumed perfect efficiency of the photodetector in channel  2 in the circuit of fig .",
    "in reality one must take into account an imperfect photodetector .",
    "if the photodetector has an efficiency @xmath52 , then the output state conditioned on a measurement of @xmath23 photons in channel  2 is a mixed state that can be written as  @xcite @xmath53 with @xmath54 the bernoullli distribution .",
    "5 shows that as the detector efficiency decreases , the oscillations in the wigner function are further washed out so that the actual state diverges from the ideal cubic phase state .",
    "the threshold theorem of quantum error correction requires that quantum gates be implemented with a minimum fidelity  @xcite . if we use the prepared state given by eq .",
    "( 16 ) as the ancilla in the circuit of fig .  1",
    ", we obtain a superposition of a cubic phase gate and a quadratic transformation on the input state . in general , the non - ideal prepared ancilla state described by eq .  ( 14 ) will result in a gate that is a superposition of the desired cubic phase gate and additional gates .",
    "the fidelity of implementing a cubic phase gate will be limited by the fidelity of preparing the cubic phase state @xmath8 .",
    "the ideal cubic phase state is not normalizable , making it challenging to assess the fidelity of preparing this state .",
    "here we define the fidelity normalized over the domain  @xmath22 ranging from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , where the prepared state @xmath57 has non - negligible support . for numerical evaluation , we define @xmath58 the fidelity @xmath59 is then calculated to be @xmath60 with @xmath61 we find that for a squeezing parameter @xmath62 and perfect detector efficiency , the normalized fidelity is roughly @xmath63 .",
    "hence , our studies show that a close approximation to the cubic phase state can not be prepared using current levels of squeezing and detector efficiency .",
    "we can define a corresponding fidelity of performing the cubic phase gate using the circuit in fig .  2 for a given input state @xmath64 as @xmath65 here @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 with @xmath69 given by eq . ( 6 ) and @xmath70 being the prepared state given by eq .",
    "the minimum gate fidelity is the gate fidelity minimized over all input states . writing the input state @xmath71 in the @xmath12 basis ,",
    "the gate fidelity becomes @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 given by eq .",
    "( 14 ) . for an input state that is an equal superposition of @xmath12 eigenstates , the state fidelity in eq .",
    "( 22 ) is equivalent to the gate fidelity for @xmath13 values close to 0 .",
    "hence , as one would expect , the fidelity of preparation of the ancilla state constrains the minimum gate fidelity of the cubic phase operation .",
    "we note that the gkp scheme for preparing the cubic phase state uses the minimal number of non - linear elements - the key element which generates a non - linear operation is a single photodetector .",
    "any other scheme that relied on gaussian operations and required more photodetectors with finite efficiency may reduce the performance .",
    "however , the use of non - gaussian ancillae in the preparation scheme may improve the preparation fidelity as discussed in the following section .",
    "whether or not the non - ideal prepared state can be used efficiently for universal quantum information processing with gaussian preserving maps is an open question ; perhaps a scheme using the prepared state in the circuit in fig .",
    "1 together with some form of error correction could provide a solution to this problem .",
    "a possible alternative might be to prepare many copies of the non - ideal state and perform some purification protocol in order to prepare a state closer to the ideal cubic phase state .",
    "furthermore , the use of alternative schemes using other non - gaussian ancilla states such as fock states may generate better approximations to the cubic phase state .",
    "we discuss this further in the following section on fock states .",
    "given the difficulty of preparing a cubic phase state via the gkp scheme , we explore the use of other non - gaussian states as possible ancilla states in gaussian - preserving circuits for implementing universal cv computation .",
    "to this end , we analyze the transformations generated by input ancilla number ( or fock ) states .",
    "we consider a general optical circuit as shown in fig .",
    "[ nancilla](a ) .",
    "the input state @xmath75 consists of @xmath2 electromagnetic field modes , each described as a harmonic oscillator .",

    "we assume that the input state is a product of gaussian states for each of the @xmath2 channels .",
    "eigenstates of @xmath0 or @xmath1 can be regarded as infinitely squeezed gaussian states and are included in the set of possible input states .",
    "we first analyze the gates generated by a single ancilla fock state @xmath77 with a specific number of photons @xmath23 .",
    "the operator @xmath78 is any element of the clifford group for continuous variables  @xcite constructed from a combination of linear optics elements and squeezers .",
    "the output state is conditioned by a homodyne measurement of the ancilla , such that @xmath79 here subscript  1 labels the input state , and subscript  2 labels the ancilla . rewriting the number state @xmath80 as a derivative of a coherent state @xmath81 with @xmath82 ( see appendix ) , @xmath83 inserting this into eq .",
    "( 28 ) , we obtain the output state @xmath84 where @xmath85 the state @xmath86 is a gaussian state since it results from a gaussian - preserving map  @xcite with input gaussian states undergoing cv clifford group transformations followed by homodyne measurements .",
    "the output state in eq .",
    "( 30 ) can also be derived by using the result that any linear optics circuit can be decomposed into an interferometer , followed by a parallel set of single mode squeezers , followed by another interferometer and additional displacements  @xcite .",
    "we now consider adding an ancilla prepared in a product of number states rather than a single number state .",
    "6(b ) ) presents the case of @xmath29 photons entering the circuit in @xmath87 channels with @xmath88 .",
    "then , using the expression for a number state given by eq .",
    "( 29 ) , we obtain a general expression for the output state at the end of the computation , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a gaussian state resulting from gaussian - preserving unitaries and homodyne measurements acting on the input gaussian state . in the @xmath12-basis , the derivative operations in eq .",
    "( 32 ) result in an output state which is a product of a gaussian function and a polynomial function of @xmath12 of maximum order @xmath91 for @xmath87 ancilla channels . by changing the circuit parameters , different such functions can be generated .",
    "it is not immediately obvious from the form of the output state in eq .",
    "( 32 ) , whether this circuit leads to universal cv quantum computation or not . in order to analyze whether this circuit is sufficient for universal cv quantum computation",
    ", we only need to consider a single - mode rather than a multi - mode input .",
    "as shown by lloyd and braunstein  @xcite , any non - gaussian unitary operation on a single mode together with the set of gaussian preserving operations is sufficient for universal cv quantum computation .",
    "this implies that since the output states in eq  ( 32 ) are not gaussians states , the circuit in fig .",
    "6 can generate a non - gaussian operation on a single input mode and hence appears to be sufficient for cv quantum computation .",
    "the challenge then is to design a particular circuit that can generate a useful nonlinear ( non - gaussian ) operation , for example a cubic phase gate on a single mode .",
    "in fact , our analysis of the gkp preparation scheme for the cubic phase state allows us to identify one possible simple circuit to perform a non - gaussian operation on a single mode using ancilla fock states .",
    "consider a single mode input state and a second ancilla mode having a single ancilla fock state with photon number @xmath23 .",
    "the ancilla state is first acted on by a momentum displacement operator with the displacement @xmath92 . for large @xmath23 , the resulting displaced number state can be written in the @xmath12-basis close to @xmath41 as a superposition of a cubic phase state and a linear phase state as given in eq .  (",
    "thus such an ancilla state when fed into the circuit of fig .  1 will generate a superposition of a cubic phase operation and a gaussian operation on a single mode .",
    "although this is not an ideal cubic phase operation , as noted before , together with error correction or purification , it may be sufficient for useful cv computation .",
    "we identified the circuit discussed above by noting that the displaced ancilla number state is none other than the @xmath39 term in eq .",
    "( 14 ) and that the state given in eq .",
    "( 14 ) is a finite superposition of fock states that is displaced in momentum .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( 14 ) shows that a finite superposition of displaced fock states rather than a single displaced fock state will closely approximate a cubic phase state for large @xmath23 and @xmath93 , and hence generate a cubic phase gate when fed into the circuit of fig .  1 .",
    "although the gkp scheme for preparing this state is limited by finite squeezing , other schemes for preparing arbitrary finite superpositions of fock states  @xcite may be able to overcome the squeezing constraint .",
    "whereas optical schemes for preparing an arbitrary , finite superposition of fock states are non - deterministic  @xcite , the interaction of light with atoms in a cavity can deterministically generate arbitrary single mode optical fields  @xcite and even fock states with large photon numbers  @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of preparing a good approximation to the cubic phase state via such schemes is the topic of future work .",
    "it is widely believed that universal quantum computation can not be classically simulated efficiently . in order to further test whether the circuits in fig .",
    "6 can perform universal cv quantum computation , we perform a natural adaptation of the efficient classical algorithm for simulating evolution when the circuit inputs ( including ancillae ) are all gaussian states  @xcite to the case of fock state ancillae .",
    "we find that the inclusion of fock state ancillae renders this algorithm inefficient , which would be consistent with the conditions for universal quantum computation . as shown in fig .",
    "6 we look at the case of @xmath2 input channels initially in a product of gaussian states along with @xmath29 total photons shared in a product state among @xmath87 ancilla channels . from  @xcite , we know that the gaussian - preserving map that transforms the input state @xmath94 into the state @xmath95 in eq .",
    "( 28 ) can be efficiently simulated classically by simply following the evolution of the means and covariance matrix of the input state . for @xmath2 input channels this involves tracking a polynomial number @xmath96 of real values .",
    "in the computational ( @xmath12 ) basis , the state @xmath95 is thus a gaussian function whose coefficients are easily computed from the means and covariances .    assuming that the subsequent derivative operations can be performed efficiently , we seek to find the resources required to characterize the final output state after all the derivative operations have been performed .",
    "the derivative operations result in a product of the gaussian function and a polynomial function of order @xmath97 for @xmath29 ancilla photons .",
    "it is simple to see that the maximum number of coefficients required to specify a general polynomial of order @xmath97 in @xmath2 variables ( for @xmath2 input channels ) , is given by @xmath98 numerical calculations verify that this quantity scales exponentially with the number of ancilla photons and input modes .",
    "our results indicate that fock states may be a useful resource for cv quantum computation .",
    "the goal of efficiently creating fock states on demand even at the level of single photons is thus of primary importance both for discrete as well as cv quantum information processing with linear optics .",

    "we have analyzed the off - line preparation and use of non - gaussian states of light as ancillary resources in optical circuits for generating nonlinear gates for universal quantum computation .",
    "our studies of the scheme to practically prepare a cubic phase state reveal that a good approximation to the ideal cubic phase state is not achievable with the best known current levels of squeezing and photodetectors .",
    "nevertheless , the non - ideal prepared state can generate interesting superpositions of gaussian and nonlinear gates that , together with error correction protocols and purification techniques , may be sufficient for universal quantum information processing .",
    "the question of designing more practical schemes for preparing and using this state remains open and requires further investigation .",
    "we have also performed a detailed analysis of ancilla fock states in optical circuits , and obtained the general set of gates that can be implemented with such states .",
    "our results indicate that a circuit using input gaussian states , ancilla fock states and consisting of clifford group elements , homodyne measurements and feed forward could generate the nonlinearity required for cv computation , but design of circuits for performing nonlinear gates is not trivial , and needs further investigation .",
    "we also find that a classical simulation of the states generated with an ancilla which is a product of ancilla fock states can scale poorly with the number of ancilla photons and input modes .",
