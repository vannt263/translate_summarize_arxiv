    "with the launch of the _ spitzer _ space telescope , identification of embedded young stellar objects ( ysos ) from their infrared excess emission at mid - infrared wavelengths ( @xmath4 using irac , the infrared array camera , and at 24@xmath3 m , using mips , the multiband imaging photometer ) has been facilitated by _",
    "spitzer s _ unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "these wavelengths are sensitive to the emission from disk and envelope material surrounding ysos , making it easier to differentiate young stellar objects from foreground or background stars where the emission is primarily photospheric . @xcite and @xcite develop a classification scheme to differentiate young stellar objects based on their irac colors , and @xcite present a scheme utilizing 24@xmath3 m data in combination with irac data .",
    "@xcite has recently presented a robust classification scheme for ysos which utilizes de - reddened mid - ir fluxes of the cluster members in combination with ground - based photometry .",
    "these classification schemes are briefly compared in the recent review article by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also employ de - reddened irac observations to identify ysos in ic348 , using an alternate classification scheme . since these schemes involve de - reddening , it is critical to provide an accurate extinction law at irac and mips wavelengths that is appropriate for young clusters embedded in nascent molecular cloud material .    examining the extinction to background stars beyond these embedded young clusters probes the column density of dust in the molecular cloud .",
    "the availability of 2mass has allowed for construction of large scale extincton maps in the near - infrared which trace a substantial range in column densities @xcite . with an appropriate extinction law",
    ", this technique could be extended to longer wavelengths where the extinction is lower and higher column densities can be probed .    throughout much of the irac range of interest ( 0.7 - 5@xmath3 m ) , @xcite fit data existing at that time to a power - law @xmath5 , with @xmath6 = 1.75 , and extrapolated the power law to meet the beginning of a silicate contribution at @xmath77 @xmath3 m in his fig . 1 ;",
    "other early papers have found @xmath6 ranging from 1.61 @xcite to 1.80 @xcite .",
    "dust models @xcite employing size distributions of various grain components with known optical properties have been constructed to match observed extinction laws .",
    "measurements of the extinction law from @xmath8 to @xmath9 have been reported by many investigators using a variety of techniques ( from both ground - based and space observations ) along a number of lines of sight , and these were thought to be  universal \" , i.e. generally in agreement with each other @xcite , although recently some authors have questioned this universality @xcite .",
    "longward of @xmath10 the extinction is less certain ( see the range in @xmath6 above ) , and the most robust estimates are generally obtained with instruments on spaceborne telescopes .",
    "pre-@xmath11 studies have relied primarily on measurements of hydrogen recombination or hydrogen rotational and ro - vibrational lines @xcite to estimate the extinction law for @xmath12 .",
    "for example , @xcite used hydrogen recombination line emission toward the galactic center to probe the extinction from @xmath13 and found that the extinction law @xmath14/@xmath15 is flatter from @xmath16 than the power laws noted above , and approximately @xmath17 smaller than the value of the standard curve at 7@xmath3 m .",
    "@xcite notes that the lack of a deep minimum near 7@xmath3 m is in conflict with predictions assuming the standard mixture of silicate and graphite grains @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite observed @xmath18 rotational and ro - vibrational lines toward omc-1 and assumed a power law ( @xmath19 extending from 2.4 to @xmath20 ) , and fit two silicate features to the extinction law beyond @xmath21 .",
    "the latter authors also determined extinctions from hydrogen recombination lines , and obtained smaller values of the relative extinction by this method than with @xmath18 lines . in that case @xmath22/@xmath15 was also relatively flatter from 3@xmath3 m - 7@xmath3 m , and from 1.5 - 2 times smaller than the comparison curve ( in this case the ir extinction law from @xcite with modifications to the 10@xmath3 m silicate feature strength : the cohen law is very similar otherwise to the one adopted by @xcite ) . a study using isogal , denis and 2mass data of intermediate agb and rgb stars in the inner galactic plane by @xcite determined values for @xmath23/@xmath24 and @xmath25 that are more comparable to those of @xcite than to earlier ` standard ' interstellar extinction curves in the solar neighborhood @xcite .    using observations of stars they identified as reddened clump giant stars in the galactic plane obtained as part of the _ spitzer _ glimpse survey , @xcite",
    "directly measured the extinction law for the _ spitzer _ irac bands at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath3 m .",
    "they observed the massive star - forming region rcw 49 at a distance exceeding 2 kpc , as well as two off - field regions very close to the galactic plane , and supplemented the _",
    "data with 2mass observations of the same fields . for the off - field regions ,",
    "their method determines the diffuse interstellar medium extinction , assuming that the red clump giants are uniformly distributed along the line of sight .",
    "reddened red clump giant stars were selected from their position in the @xmath26 vs. @xmath27 color - magnitude diagram , and a reddening band was identified which was then used to determine @xmath28 assuming a narrow distribution of intrinsic colors and luminosities of the clump giants .",
    "@xmath29 was then determined from @xmath30-k_s$ ] vs. @xmath27 color - color diagrams for these objects .",
    "the extinction curve for all three of these regions was nearly identical and also appeared to have a shallower slope for @xmath31 than the standard law .",
    "r. indebetouw kindly provided the data for these three regions so that we could process them using the same methods that we used to process our data , hence making possible a direct comparison of the extinction laws toward the young clusters studied here , and that along the lines - of - sight probed by @xcite .    here",
    "we determine the extinction law from @xmath4 toward five young , nearby ( @xmath32 1 kpc ) cluster regions , including the orion a cloud , ngc 2068/71 , ngc 2024/23 , ophiuchus and serpens .",
    "we further determine the extinction at @xmath1 for two of the regions , ngc 2068/71 and serpens .",
    "in all cases we measure extinctions in relatively broad wavebands as determined by fixed , cold filters . by examining those stars without disk / envelope infrared excess emission in the cloud direction ,",
    "we evaluate the selective extinction at mid - infrared wavelengths : the extinction derives primarily from their host molecular clouds , although extinction from the diffuse interstellar medium is also a factor . we compare our determination against prior determinations in the literature including the  standard extinction law \" such as that compiled by @xcite .",
    "it is important when comparing these determinations to keep in mind that spectroscopic measurements may differ from our broad - band measurements at these wavelengths .",
    "our separate extinction law study at the wavelengths of the irac bands is motivated by a discrepancy between slopes of the bands of reddened sources in the @xmath33 vs. @xmath34 $ ] color - color diagrams for our clusters , and slopes found using the glimpse data . reddened non - excess sources form a band on the @xmath33 vs. @xmath34 $ ] color - color diagrams extending from the intrinsic colors of the stars parallel to the reddening vector whose _ slope _ is the color - excess ratio @xmath0}$ ] @xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "these color excess ratios , derived in section  [ obs ] and given in table 2 for our data , and for the glimpse data provided by indebetouw , illustrate at a glance the discrepancy between selective extinction slopes toward our sources and theirs .",
    "@xcite also found a slope discrepancy between the selective extinction law toward isolated dense molecular cores observed in the _ spitzer _ cores to disks ( c2d ) legacy program @xcite , and toward those regions examined by @xcite .",
    "for these young clusters , and for the regions examined by @xcite , we utilize in our analysis those stars without a mid - infrared excess in the irac color - color diagrams @xcite , namely class iii cluster objects , and field stars .",
    "background dwarfs and red giants , including the red clump giants , are the primary probes of the extinction that originate in the clusters nascent molecular clouds . using complementary 2mass ground - based @xmath37 and @xmath38 data as well as @xmath11 data on these objects , we measure the color excess ratios @xmath0}$ ] from @xmath33 vs. @xmath34 $ ] color - color diagrams , and from these ultimately derive @xmath29 for an assumed value of @xmath39 .",
    "the same method allows extension to 24@xmath3 m for the serpens and ngc @xmath2 clusters , although these results are more uncertain because of the comparative paucity of detected sources .    in section  [ obs ] the observations and data reduction",
    "will be discussed , and section  [ measure_ext ] will describe source selection and the derivation of the reddening law from these data . section  [ results ] will report the results and discuss the differences between the extinction law derived here for our data and for the data used in the study by @xcite , as well as the extinction law derived using different methods and extinction probes by @xcite , with further reference to other determinations @xcite .",
    "we have not determined the total to selective extinction in this study , so shall concentrate on relative extinctions , assuming a value for @xmath39 in order to make comparisons with other work . because a non - universal extinction law may lead to variations in this assumed value ,",
    "we consider how this assumption affects our results .",
    "observations of several young star - forming clusters were obtained with the irac camera @xcite aboard _",

    "the irac camera takes simultaneous images in four channels whose isophotal wavelengths are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively @xcite .",
    "some of the regions observed cover several square degrees so that multiple aors with the irac camera were required .",
    "ngc @xmath45 and ngc @xmath46 were imaged as part of the same region , while ngc @xmath47 and ngc @xmath48 were also observed together .",
    "observations of the orion a cloud included coverage of omc 2/3 , onc and l1641 .",
    "high dynamic range mode @xcite was used , resulting in a frame with a @xmath49 second exposure time and a frame with a @xmath50 second exposure time at each position .",
    "the maps for each of ngc 2024/23 , ngc 2068/71 and orion a were repeated twice .",
    "the maps of serpens and ophiuchus were repeated four times , with small offsets .",
    "the additional dithers provide both additional sensitivity to faint sources and greater ability to remove cosmic rays from the final mosaics .",
    "we have not corrected for the position dependent gain variation for point sources , which would result in an additional 5% uncertainty .    for the orion fields individual frames",
    "were mosaiced using a custom idl program and from these mosaics , source selection and point source photometry were completed using gutermuth s photvis v@xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the photometry used an aperture of @xmath52 and a sky annulus with inner and outer radii of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "details on the data reduction and source selection in serpens and ophiuchus are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite discusses the calibration of the irac instrument .",
    "the calibration of the _ spitzer _ telescope was refined during the course of this work , and the resulting zero points are listed in table 1 .",
    "however , changes in the zero point do not change the results in this paper and are taken into account in our fitting technique . from the 2mass point source database we obtained corresponding @xmath54 and @xmath38 band magnitudes for each star . for the ngc @xmath2 , ngc @xmath55 and serpens regions , we required magnitude uncertainty @xmath56 in all seven bands for sources used to calculate the extinction law . for the orion a cloud and ophiuchus a detection in j band",
    "was not required , thereby increasing the number of highly reddened sources and providing a better determination of the extinction law . for the remaining 6 bands ,",
    "a magnitude uncertainty of @xmath57 was imposed . if we do not require a j band detection for ngc @xmath55 , ngc @xmath2 or serpens , our derived values for the slope of the extinction vector are within @xmath58 of the values derived with the seven - band data .    requiring sources to have this magnitude uncertainty reduced the spread of the sources on each color - color diagram , and minimized the uncertainty in the fit ( see section  [ measure_ext ] ) .",
    "those sources for which only upper limits to 2mass magnitudes were available were not included in our analysis .",
    "most of the sources had much smaller magnitude uncertainties .",
    "the median magnitude uncertainties for ngc 2024/23 sources are @xmath59 for @xmath60 , and channels 1 through 4 of irac respectively .",
    "similar median magnitude uncertainties were obtained for the other regions studied here . loosening the requirement on",
    "the maximum uncertainty will include more sources with lower fluxes .",
    "it is possible that these sources have higher extinction and could provide a more accurate measure of the reddening law .",
    "however , increasing the uncertainty limit leads to the inclusion of more outliers that skew the slope and are difficult to remove with a simple color cut .",
    "a small number of fits did not have any outliers and for these fits including the sources with higher uncertainty does not change our results by more than the measured uncertainty in the color excess ratios .",
    "mips 24 @xmath3 m images were available for several of the regions studied .",
    "not all regions were suitable - there were insufficient non - excess sources in some regions to reliably derive an extinction law .",
    "we report on ngc 2068/71 and serpens observations with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips , * ? ? ?",
    "we summarize the mips observations , with more detailed descriptions of the data reduction and photometric measurements for serpens and ngc 2068/71 in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the measurements were obtained in scan mode with half - array cross - section offsets .",
    "all three mips bands are observed simultaneously in this mode ; the total effective exposure time per point is about 80 seconds at 24 microns .",
    "photometry was determined using a psf fitting program in idl .",
    "background dwarfs and giants ( including red clump giants and rgb stars ) as well as embedded pre - main sequence stars can be used to measure the extinction due to the molecular cloud dust associated with the star - forming region as well as diffuse line - of - sight extinction . as mentioned above",
    ", the sources used to measure the extinction were chosen from those without infrared excesses from disk or envelope emission in the @xmath61-[4.5]$ ] vs. @xmath62-[8.0]$ ] color - color diagram toward each cluster region .",
    "eliminating infrared excess sources from consideration removes any ambiguities between stars with red colors caused by extinction vs. stars with circumstellar dust or envelope emission , including both pre - main sequence stars and agb stars .",
    "a non - excess source was defined as having colors @xmath61-[4.5 ] < 0.6 $ ] and @xmath62-[8.0 ] < 0.2 $ ] .",
    "this region of consideration was chosen so that it did not overlap with the expected position of pre - main sequence stars with disks according to @xcite and included the expected spread in colors due to interstellar dust reddening , which is larger at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "this definition of non - excess sources is consistent with the theoretical models of @xcite , and the observations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an upper limit on the @xmath61-[4.5]$ ] color is used to eliminate unresolved outflow sources misidentified as stars .",
    "outflows have emission features in the 4.5 @xmath3 m band , leading to @xmath61-[4.5]$ ] colors which could be confused with those from reddened non - excess stars .",
    "we extend our selection criteria to attempt to further remove foreground stars , and stars whose colors place them outside the reddening band .",
    "we remove foreground giants by excluding any star brighter than a k2iii giant with @xmath63 @xcite at the distance of each cluster .",
    "we also exclude stars with @xmath64 , which are mostly foreground dwarfs ( see discussion below ) . stars with @xmath65<0 $ ] do not fit into the reddening band and are removed as well as stars that appear to have an excess in the @xmath33 vs @xmath66 $ ] diagram ( e.g. @xmath67)-0.2 $ ] for serpens ) .",
    "we have not attempted to use only clump red giants , as was done by @xcite , because of the difficulty in distinguishing these stars from highly reddened dwarfs and pre - main sequence stars without disks .",
    "our reddest stars will be dominated by red giants and embedded pre - main sequence stars because of the large intrinsic luminosity needed to detect these stars at such high extinction although at lower extinction we may have a mix of reddened dwarfs as well as giants and pre - main sequence stars . for orion",
    "a , a number of galaxies contaminated the field and their removal from consideration is discussed in section  [ oriona ] .",
    "@xcite point out that stars lying to bluer colors than the red clump giant distribution in a @xmath26 or @xmath68 vs. @xmath69 color - magnitude diagram for a given line of sight are primarily dwarfs , while stars lying to redder colors are predominantly m giants and agb stars .",

    "the red clump giant distribution shifts to redder @xmath69 , fainter magnitudes and the distribution is broader .",
    "all of our clusters have galactic latitudes exceeding 6@xmath72 , with the exception of serpens , at @xmath73=5.4@xmath72 . to illustrate the above points for one of our clusters , we show a @xmath26 vs. @xmath27 diagram for ngc 2068/71 ( a region of high extinction ) as well as an off - cloud region overplotted ( fig .",
    "[ jvj - k_2068_off ] ) .",
    "the off - cloud field is centered at l=210@xmath72 , b=-8@xmath72 , a region that was chosen because it did not show any significant co emission indicative of a dense molecular cloud @xcite . in that diagram , the sources coincident with the cluster utilized in measuring the color - excess ratios are plotted with blue symbols , and red symbols illustrate cluster sources rejected by the @xmath33 cutoff .",
    "off - cluster sources are plotted with black symbols . in the black double - peaked distribution ,",
    "dwarfs at various distances along the line of sight occupy the bluer peak , and the red clump sources the redder , with median color @xmath74 = 0.75 , as noted above .",
    "the effect of the molecular cloud s reddening can be seen by noting that most red clump extinction probes to ngc 2068/71 form a clump centered at @xmath27=1.05 at @xmath26=14.5 .",
    "the off - cloud giants have nearly constant @xmath27 color , indicating little extinction from the diffuse ism . for this reason we expect the contribution of the diffuse ism to our measured extinction law for the orion fields to be small , although this may not be equally valid for serpens and ophiuchus .",
    "many sources redder than the red clump giants are sampled , and in particular , for the cluster region ( red and blue points ) in figure  [ jvj - k_2068_off ] there is no distinct red clump giant locus . in the cluster region ,",
    "the highly variable extinction makes it impossible to isolate red clump giants , reddened dwarfs and embedded pre - main sequence stars .",
    "we are likely dominated by red clump giants , and perhaps pre - main sequence stars , in the densest parts of the cluster , because they are bright enough to be observed at large reddening .",
    "however , we do not attempt to use only red clump giants .",
    "we now move to discussion of reddening law determination .",
    "a straight line was fit to background sources in the ` reddening ' band on an @xmath33 vs. @xmath34 $ ] color - color diagram .",
    "after all of the restrictions described above were imposed , there were 415 , 670 , 1830 and 1225 background sources for ngc @xmath75 , ngc @xmath2 , orion a and serpens respectively .",

    "the line fit to the reddening band data in each of the @xmath33 vs. @xmath34 $ ] color - color diagrams minimized the chi - squared , weighted by the uncertainty in each color .    @xmath77    where @xmath78 and @xmath73 are the y - intercept and slope , respectively , of the best fit line and @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the uncertainties in the x and y - values respectively .",
    "the algorithm _ amoeba _ in idl was used to minimize the chi - squared . determining the best fit - line to the reddening band data using equation  [ chisq ] not only accounts for the magnitude uncertainties , but also provides a method for estimating the uncertainty in the slope , which leads directly to @xmath29 , the quantity of interest .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed analysis of the adopted fitting technique as well as the characterization of its uncertainty , which we summarize here for the convenience of the reader .",
    "at the best - fit points the @xmath81 is a minimum , but if the values of @xmath78 and @xmath73 are perturbed away from the best - fit values @xmath81 increases .",
    "a constant value of @xmath82 gives a confidence region within parameter space , which depending on the size of @xmath83 , could enclose a @xmath84 , @xmath85 , etc .",
    "confidence interval .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath78 and @xmath73 is then the projection of this confidence region onto the @xmath78 and @xmath73 axis .",
    "finding @xmath86 where @xmath83 has a specific value is determined analytically with a taylor expansion when @xmath81 is linear in @xmath73 , but must be determined numerically here because @xmath81 is non - linear in @xmath73 .",

    "was chosen to be 1 , which corresponds to a @xmath84 confidence level @xcite .",
    "increasing the confidence level to @xmath87 requires @xmath88 , which results in an increased uncertainty in the slope .",

    "serpens fewer than 50 sources were used for the final fit , making sure to exclude outliers and sources with @xmath92 , so we are working with quite small numbers of sources . for this reason",
    ", we view these results with extreme caution .",
    "while the process for deriving the extinction law from serpens , ophiuchus , ngc 2068/71 and ngc 2024/23 data was straightforward , the number and variety of sources toward orion a required more careful attention .",
    "the orion a cloud covers @xmath93 square degrees , a much larger area than the other four regions observed , increasing the number of sources used when determining the reddening law but also increasing the number of outliers .",
    "these outliers are most obvious on the @xmath33 vs. @xmath66 $ ] color - color diagram on which there is a ` branch ' with @xmath94 which could skew the fit .",
    "this ` branch ' is not as dominant in any of the other @xmath33 vs. @xmath34 $ ] color - color - diagrams and has nearly constant @xmath94 color as well as @xmath95 .",
    "the objects in this branch are too blue in @xmath33 color to be infrared excess sources but they are too red in @xmath66 $ ] color to be main - sequence stars , red giants , or class iii sources .",
    "the most likely explanation is that these sources are galaxies .",
    "their blue colors in the near infrared likely derive from main - sequence stars dominating the light at short wavelengths .",
    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission from the dust within the galaxies is the likely cause of the red @xmath66 $ ] color , since strong pah feature emission falls within the @xmath91 $ ] band of irac .",
    "interpreting these sources as galaxies is consistent with their fairly uniform spread in position throughout the orion a cloud .",
    "they are also not present in the areas with the highest concentration of young stellar objects because these areas have a large density of nebulosity which decreases the sensitivity for detection of background objects , and a high column density of dust obscuring faint background sources .",
    "it is also possible that foreground sources contaminated by extended pah emission are contaminants : however , this does not explain the lack of outliers in the regions of largest pah emission near the young stars .",
    "regardless of the physical nature of these outliers , we remove them from our fitting procedure .",
    "a first attempt at removing these outliers was performed by changing the selection criteria for non - excess sources .",
    "this did not effectively remove the outliers without also removing a signifcant number of sources in the reddening band which are needed to accurately measure the extinction law . removing these outliers , without removing a substantial number of sources in the reddening band ,",
    "was completed by first fitting a line in the @xmath33 vs. @xmath66 $ ] color - color diagram to all of the non - excess sources , including the outliers , and then using the slope of this fit to define a boundary line ( @xmath96)-0.2 $ ] ) , below which were assumed outliers and above which were the sources used for a more accurate measure of the extinction .",
    "the y - intercept of this line was chosen so that a majority of the outliers was removed without removing a significant portion of the reddening band .",
    "the initial fit in the @xmath33 vs. @xmath66 $ ] color - color diagram had a slope of @xmath97 and the final fit had a slope of @xmath98 with @xmath99 decreasing from @xmath100 for the initial fit to @xmath101 for the final fit . while this is a small correction , the final fit is a more accurate measurement of the extinction law at @xmath21 .",
    "the slopes of the linear fits to the @xmath33 vs. @xmath34 $ ] color - color diagrams for our five clusters are listed in table  [ slopes ] and plotted in figures  [ ngc2024_red ] ,  [ ngc2068_red ] ,  [ serp_red ] ,  [ oph_red ] , and  [ oriona_red ] .",
    "it is apparent that our derived slopes ( color excess ratios ) are reasonably consistent from region to region , but in a few instances , are more than 1-@xmath102 different from each other at the longer wavelengths . in particular , the selective color excess ratio toward the ophiuchus cloud is lower than toward the other four clouds at 8.0@xmath103 . since ophiuchus has the smallest number of non - excess sources ( 120 vs. @xmath104400 for the other four regions)we assess the possibility that the difference is due to the small number of non - excess sources .",
    "we randomly select 120 non - excess sources from the orion a field and measure the color - excess ratios in the four irac bands for the subsample , repeating this process for 1000 subsamples .",
    "we can estimate how likely it is to measure the ophiuchus color - excess ratios based on the distribution of color - excess ratios in each of the four bands for the subsamples .",
    "for the 5.8 and 8  bands the average color - excess ratio for the subsamples is 1.115 and 1.122 , with a standard deviation of 0.06 for both bands .",
    "the ophiuchus color - excess ratios are approximately 2@xmath102 from these mean color - excess ratios at both 5.8 and 8 , only a marginally significant deviation .",
    "the fraction of subsamples with color - excess ratios at or below the ophiuchus values are 3% and 1% for the 5.8 and 8  bands respectively .",
    "thus sample size is unlikely to be the cause of the lower selective color excess ratio at 8.0@xmath103 for ophiuchus .",

    "if using only red clump giant probes produced a systematically different extinction law than we measured , we would expect a locus of sources to follow the @xcite law at all four bands .",
    "no such locus is observed in figure  [ residual ] , suggesting that extinction probes are not the main cause of the systematic difference .",
    "sources with @xmath117 , which are mostly red giants , show a substantial deviation from the @xcite extinction law .",

    "rederived glimpse color excess ratios are systematically separated from the color excess ratios for the five young clusters observed here . while there are differences in the results derived from the glimpse data using the different methodologies , especially at 3.6 and 4.5 , there is still a significant separation between our color excess ratios and those from @xcite .",

    "@xcite compared the observed to expected fluxes for 15 hydrogen recombination lines toward the galactic center from iso data and from this determined the extinction ratios at the wavelengths of the emission lines .",

    "the recombination line results also depend on the assumed helium abundance , [ heii]/[heiii ] , and the assumption that line emissions emanate from the same volume .",
    "a crucial part of their analysis is the scaling of their relative extinction law : they deduce @xmath14/@xmath130 ( br@xmath6 at 2.626@xmath3 m is the shortest - wave emission line they observe ) and use a @xmath131 scaling law to refer to @xmath68-band .",
    "we will use a @xmath132 law which corresponds to our assumed @xmath120 = 1.55 , allowing for a more direct comparison with our values of @xmath29 ( see discussion below ) .",
    "numerical data on @xmath22/@xmath15 were provided courtesy of d. lutz : here we deduce from these data @xmath14/@xmath130 , and using a factor of @xmath24/@xmath130=1.38 ( assuming the power law index @xmath6=1.65 ) , deduce @xmath14/@xmath24 for their data .",
    "since we use 2mass @xmath133 data , we have taken the wavelength for @xmath38-band to be 2.16@xmath3 m .",
    "power law indices of 1.61 and 1.8 lead to at most a 2% error in the extinction ratio .",
    "this is considerably more certain than variations in @xmath134 , which can be as much as 30% @xcite , so we choose not to compute @xmath135 for our data .",
    "@xcite combined iso observations at 7 and 15@xmath103 of the inner galactic plane with 2mass and denis near - infrared observation to determine the mid - infrared extinction law and its variation along different sightlines .",

    "assuming @xmath139 from @xcite they find @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( marked as circles in figure  [ ext_wav ] ) .",
    "although @xcite did not measure the extinction law with the 2mass photometric system , @xcite found @xmath28 in the 2mass photometric system to be similar to the value of @xmath139 measured by @xcite .",
    "the results from @xcite do not change significantly when using @xmath28 from @xcite as opposed to @xmath139 from @xcite . at 7@xmath103",
    "they find the extinction law measurements have a gaussian distribution whose one sigma size encompasses the measurements presented here , as well as those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there is more uncertainty at @xmath142 but there also appears to be evidence for a gaussian distribution of extinction values , @xmath143 .",
    "we chose @xmath39 from @xcite to provide a direct comparison of all the mid - infrared selective extinction law measurements discussed here .",
    "the extinction law measurements by @xcite use a similar normalization to our assumed @xmath120 , and the measurements of @xcite were normalized using a power law form that is consistent with @xmath126 .",
    "different assumptions of the near - infrared extinction law will affect our derived @xmath29 as discussed earlier , but we choose a single consistent normalization to better compare the various determinations of the mid - infrared extinction law .",
    "a plausible explanation for the separation between our extinction law and the extinction law of @xcite is a variation in the extinction law between that through the diffuse ism and through molecular clouds .",
    "variation in dust optical properties between molecular cloud dust and that in the ism has been invoked by @xcite , who , from observations of cloud cores obtained as part of the c2d _ spitzer _ legacy program , have also found extinction law slopes ( color excess ratios ) which deviate from those of @xcite .",
    "the cold ism includes diffuse interstellar clouds ( @xmath144 0.1 ) , poorly shielded regions of molecular clouds ( @xmath144 3 ) , and dense molecular cloud cores ( @xmath145 3 ) . @xcite and references therein , have explored grain growth in dense clouds , and have reported differing extinction laws for the diffuse ism and dense clouds . for reference ,",
    "@xmath15=3 is shown as a vertical dashed line in figure  [ residual ] : most of the deviation of our results from the @xcite extinction law occurs at higher extinctions .",
    "changes in the extinction law originating in these regions are likely due to grain growth , either by coagulation of small grains or the growth of icy mantles , both of which will affect the continuum level of extinction .",
    "small grains are thought to coagulate to form larger grains ( e.g. @xmath146 oph , @xcite ) : grain emissivity is dependent on the optical constituent properties , and for the same constituents is proportional to a power(powers ) of _ a_/@xmath147 where _ a _ is the grain size .",
    "grain growth will not only remove small grains as potential absorbers , but also as emitters .",
    "the lack of emission from small grains has been observed along lines of sight with high column densities @xcite suggesting grain growth leading to porous grains with enhanced emissivity within these clouds . @xcite",
    "have found a decrease in the depth of the 9.7 @xmath3 m silicate feature with increasing @xmath15 , indicating silicate grain growth .",
    "@xmath148 3 is the approximate extinction threshold for the detection of ice mantles , and in the taurus dark cloud , icy mantle growth is implicated @xcite .",
    "dust in molecular cloud cores is protected both from the uv interstellar radiation field and from cosmic ray processing ; those dust grains may therefore have larger mantles consisting of water and organic ices @xcite .",
    "absorption features between 3 and 8  due to ices are often seen along lines of sight intersecting dense molecular clouds @xcite while they are not seen in the diffuse ism @xcite . on the other hand , grain processing and fragmentation",
    "because of radiative shock propagation , and turbulence , may also be involved in grain evolution in both molecular clouds and in the diffuse ism .",
    "our extinction law for the young clusters studied here derives mainly from dust associated with their molecular clouds , while that of @xcite derives primarily from diffuse interstellar dust , especially for the @xmath106 off - cloud line of sight .",
    "there is a greater contribution from diffuse interstellar dust for the closest clusters in our sample , ophiuchus and serpens , partially because they are in the inner galaxy , and partially because the extinction probes ( not excluded by the @xmath149 brightness cutoff ) lie well behind the cluster , so that their light passes through more of the ism before reaching the cluster .",
    "the extinction curve toward ophiuchus has been termed anomalous : measurements of the uv / optical extinction curve and linear polarization @xcite toward ophiuchus indicate a depletion of small grains and the presence of large grains within the molecular cloud .",
    "studies of other dark clouds have produced similarly anomalous extinction as compared with the ism : we are unaware of any comprehensive study comparing optical / uv extinction in the dark clouds studied here .",
    "@xcite observe h@xmath150o and co ices in the taurus and ophiuchus dark clouds , and concur with previous studies that different physical conditions obtain in those two clouds .",
    "although column densities of the h@xmath150o ices and the visual extinction are correlated in each case , the regression line is different .",
    "there are several ophiuchus sources which follow the taurus regression line rather than that for ophiuchus , suggesting physical properties of the grains can also vary within the cloud . @xcite and @xcite measure the emissivity spectral index @xmath6 ( @xmath151 ) in the far - infrared and find variations between orion , ophiuchus and serpens .",
    "this indicates that the grain properties differ between these three clouds , but the anticorrelation between spectral index and temperature within a cloud suggests that there can be significant variations in grain properties along different lines of sight through a single cloud .",
    "consequently , we can not determine here the extent to which the molecular cloud mid - ir extinction toward ophiuchus is anomalous compared with other clouds in our sample .",
    "in contrast to our clusters , all within 500 pc of the sun , the lines of sight for the iso measurement may include a larger contribution from a mixture of extinction from the diffuse ism and molecular clouds .",
    "the @xcite extinction law to the galactic center ionized gas is dominated by dust in the diffuse ism along the line of sight , although some of the extinction is due to molecular cloud material @xcite .",
    "broad ice absorption features at 3 and 6  are seen toward sgr a * and are attributed to foreground molecular cloud material @xcite .",
    "the @xcite extinction law is for a mix of diffuse ism and dense molecular cloud dust . given the uncertainties in the derived laws of @xcite and @xcite , we can not distinguish whether any agreement , or lack of agreement with either our law or that of @xcite depends on whether the material causing extinction is part of the diffuse ism or a dense cloud .",
    "the differing dust properties between diffuse ism and dense molecular clouds could lead to differences in the extinction law .",
    "we directly measure @xmath0}$ ] , which relates @xmath152}/a_{k_s}$ ] and the assumed value of @xmath39 . a variation in the near - infrared extinction law , the mid - infrared extinction law , or both , could lead to the observed systematic separation in the selective color excess ratios between our observations through molecular clouds and @xcite s observations through the diffuse ism .",
    "if a larger value of @xmath39 was more appropriate for the extinction law toward molecular clouds , then @xmath152}/a_{k_s}$ ] would be smaller and the _ mid - infrared _ portion of the extinction law deduced by @xcite and us could be made to agree .",
    "values of @xmath39 between 1.6 and 1.65 , depending on the region , would bring our mid - infrared extinction law into agreement with the average extinction law reported by @xcite , assuming @xmath126 still applied to the @xcite extinction law",
    ". it may also be the case that the near - infrared extinction law does not appreciably vary between the diffuse ism and molecular clouds and there is instead a variation in the mid - infrared extinction law .",
    "we now examine the near- and mid - infrared data separately in order to attempt to break this degeneracy .",
    "the possibility of variations in @xmath39 is suggested by recent observations .",
    "although @xcite and @xcite found the near - infrared extinction law to be universal , more recent studies have produced mixed results .",
    "one of the difficulties in evaluating the variation in the near - infrared extinction law along different lines of sight is that different photometric systems ( e.g. @xmath68 vs. @xmath38 ) can have a substantial effect on the measured extinction law @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite observed the nearby star - forming regions @xmath146 oph and cha i , respectively , and determined the near - infrared reddening law using the same technique , but with different photometric systems , and find a substantial difference in the reddening law between these two lines of sight .",
    "@xcite reobserved @xmath146 oph and cha i with one photometric system and used the same technique , the same off - cloud regions , and the same limiting magnitudes as the previous studies by @xcite and @xcite but found no variation in the near - infrared reddening law between these two molecular clouds .",

    "no significant difference exists in the near infrared color excess ratios among these lines of sight within uncertainties , indicating that there is no significant variation in the near - infrared extinction law through these three molecular clouds and through the interstellar medium .",
    "we examine the mid - infrared portion of the extinction law by forming color - excess ratios that include only irac bands from the already measured color excess ratios . from the definition of the color excess ratio @xmath158}}=\\frac{a_h - a_{k_s}}{a_{k_s}-a_{\\lambda}}\\ ] ] we form the following quantity : @xmath159 by choosing @xmath160 and @xmath161 we have a measure of the irac - only color - excess ratio . by combining color - excess ratios rather than using the extinction law measurements , @xmath29 , we reduce the uncertainty in the irac - only color - excess ratio .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ irac_ratio ] for all five young clusters as well as for the @xmath162=@xmath156 off - cloud line of sight .",
    "while the uncertainties are large , there is clear evidence for a separation between the extinction law measured toward the molecular clouds and the extinction law for only the diffuse ism .",
    "the tabulated values of this ratio demonstrate that the variations between our color - excess ratios and those of @xcite can not be explained solely by a change in the value of @xmath118 , and that the form of the interstellar extinction law must differ between the diffuse ism , ophiuchus , and the remaining four molecular clouds .",
    "it is also apparent that the ophiuchus cloud reddening law differs from the reddening law for the other four young clusters .      extending our analysis out to 24  we measure @xmath163}=0.98\\pm0.04 $ ] and @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 , assuming @xmath126 , for serpens and ngc 2068/71 respectively . the large uncertainty for both regions color excess ratios reflects the small number of sources used in the fitting procedure .",

    "the shape of the 9.7  feature was chosen to match the trapezium emissivity profile , which is more appropriate for extinction due to dense molecular clouds rather than the narrower @xmath3 cephei profile @xcite . while the assumption of a power law from @xmath4 is clearly not valid , the extinction law from @xmath174 , as measured here and by @xcite and @xcite , is very well fit by a law dominated by silicate emission with the adopted strengths of the two silicate features given by @xcite , as can be seen in figure  [ ext_wav ] .",
    "the @xmath170 silicate feature has been found to vary along different lines of sight @xcite , particularly on the long - wavelength side of the feature , although there is insufficient data here to draw any conclusions about the universality of the extinction law from @xmath175 .",
    "we measured the extinction law from @xmath176 toward five nearby star - forming regions and found it to be relatively internally consistent among different cluster - forming molecular clouds although there is evidence that the ophiuchus extinction law deviates from the other four regions at 5.8 and 8 .",
    "the extinction laws we present here differ systematically from the extinction at irac wavelengths derived by @xcite , as seen in both the color excess ratios and the relative extinction ratios . to exclude any possibility that this difference could be due to the differing methodologies used to derive the extinction law , we have also analysed data provided by r. indebetouw using our methods , and continue to find systematic variation .",
    "the result could reflect a physical difference in the extinction law between the diffuse ism and molecular clouds , or the differing extinction probes utilized in the two studies .",
    "our study of the probes leads us to believe that the major cause of the discrepancy is variation in the diffuse ism vs. molecular cloud extinction laws .",
    "the observed difference in the extinction law towards ophiuchus could be caused by diffuse ism behind the molecular cloud that the extinction probes must pass through or differing dust properties between the ophiuchus cloud and the other four clouds studied .",

    "<S> we present an independent estimate of the interstellar extinction law for the _ spitzer _ irac bands as well as a first attempt at extending the law to the 24  mips band . </S>",
    "<S> the source data for these measurements are observations of five nearby star - forming regions : the orion a cloud , ngc 2068/71 , ngc 2024/23 , serpens and ophiuchus . </S>",
    "<S> color excess ratios @xmath0}$ ] were measured for stars without infrared excess dust emission from circumstellar disks / envelopes . for four of these five regions , </S>",
    "<S> the extinction laws are similar at all wavelengths and differ systematically from a previous determination of the extinction law , which was dominated by the diffuse ism , derived for the irac bands . </S>",
    "<S> this difference could be due to the difference in the dust properties of the dense molecular clouds observed here and those of the diffuse ism . </S>",
    "<S> the extinction law at longer wavelengths toward the ophiuchus region lies between that to the other four regions studied here and that for the ism . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we extended our extinction law determination to @xmath1 for serpens and ngc @xmath2 using _ spitzer _ mips data . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these results against several iso extinction law determinations , although in each case there are assumptions which make absolute comparison uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> however , our work confirms a relatively flatter extinction curve from 4 - 8@xmath3 m than the previously assumed standard , as noted by all of these recent studies . </S>",
    "<S> the extinction law at @xmath1 is consistent with previous measurements and models , although there are relatively large uncertainties . </S>"
