    "the expectation from lattice qcd calculations ( an example shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : qcd ] , from ref .",
    "@xcite ) was that colliding nuclei at relativistic energies would form a hot , dense system where the degrees of freedom would no longer be the hadrons measured in the final state , but rather their quark and gluon constituents .",
    "however , the data collected by the four experiments at rhic  two large , and two small , all covering both unique and overlapping ranges in phase space  arrived at the surprising conclusion that the system formed in the collisions was a `` perfect liquid ''  @xcite .",
    "this is a non - trivial observation , given that asymptotic freedom implied that interactions between the quarks and gluons should become weaker at higher energies  @xcite .",
    "instead , the system appears to flow collectively as if the interactions between the relevant degrees of freedom are exceedingly strong .",
    "the latter property can be quantified by the viscosity , which is large for an non - interacting gas , and zero at infinite coupling .",
    "early estimates of the viscosity of the medium formed at rhic ( discussed below ) suggest that it is within a factor of 2 from the so - called `` viscosity bound '' predicted using the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , shown compared to normal fluids in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : qcd ]",
    ". this may well be the first prediction from string theory to be validated by experiment , a major development for both heavy ion physics and string theory .",
    "this work will discuss the most important results of `` soft '' physics at rhic , which involve the characteristics of multiparticle production at low momentum , rather than the rare production of high momentum particles .",
    "soft physics is of great practical value , as it is available to experiments right after a machine starts . and",
    "while it is not yet amenable to perturbative approaches , it provides a handle on a sector of qcd of great interest for understanding the medium produced in rhic collisions .",
    "the discovery of the perfect fluid at rhic was established by a series of inferences from the final state back in time to the initial state .",
    "the spectrum of final state pions is manifestly blackbody in shape , as one can see in distributions of identified particles ( e.g. ref .",

    "[ fig : thermalmodel ] from the star experiment  @xcite , shows an excellent agreement and requires only three parameters : a chemical freezeout temperature ( @xmath3 ) , a baryochemical potential ( @xmath4 ) reflecting the excess of baryons in the initial state , and a strangeness suppression factor ( which is found to be nearly unity at rhic ) .",
    "these data suggest that the system was thermalized at the time of freezeout and was thus at least @xmath5 mev during its evolution .",
    "the success of describing the data from such a wide variety of hadron states validates the approach begun by rolf hagedorn in the 1960 s , who observed the thermal slopes in hadron momentum spectra and postulated that they were emitted from a thermalized state  @xcite .",
    "the observation of the same temperature in all systems led him to also propose a `` limiting temperature '' arising from an exponentially rising mass spectrum ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the rising mass spectrum was a prediction borne out by forty years of subsequent measurements , making surpassing the hagedorn temperature @xmath7 mev that much more interesting for heavy ion experiments forming hot and dense matter .",
    "lattice qcd calculations appear to have no limiting temperature , reflecting the fact that they find a discontinuity in the number of degrees of freedom , e.g. as quantified by @xmath8 shown as a function of t in the right panel of fig.[fig : qcd ] , at a temperature quite similar to @xmath9  @xcite .     vs. @xmath10 for @xmath11 gev from phobos compared with a hydrodynamical model .",

    "this is especially pronounced in more peripheral ( i.e.  lower multiplicity ) collisions , where the overlap of the nuclei is shaped like an almond , relative to central ( i.e.  higher multiplicity ) collisions where the overlap is essentially isotropic .",

    "this number is far smaller than the time taken a massless particle to traverse the radius of a hadron ( @xmath18 fm / c )  @xcite .",
    "the same calculations determine that the energy density needed to match the data is around @xmath19 gev/@xmath20 , about 60 times the density of a nucleon in its rest frame , @xmath21 mev/@xmath20 .",
    "it should be noted that these estimates do not preclude even higher energy densities at even earlier times .",
    "the agreement of hydrodynamic models with rhic collisions is an important , but surprising , development .",
    "hydrodynamics is not merely `` another '' model , but describes a medium with particular properties , difficult to generate by the rescattering of partons or hadrons .",
    "it is a locally equilibrated system , with a well - defined temperature at any given space - time location .",
    "the agreement with data , particularly the detailed flow of heavy particles , seems to require a `` lattice - like '' equation of state , with a speed of sound that drops rapidly at the hadronization temperature . with an energy density at least 60 times the energy density of a proton ,",
    "the system resists a description as interacting hadrons , as their wave functions would all be overlapping and thus indistinguishable as individual particle states .",
    "this same energy density implies a temperature about 2 - 3 times the critical temperature found on the lattice , well above the hagedorn temperature . exceeding",
    "the hagedorn temperature is a key piece of evidence required for any system claiming to have degrees of freedom comprised of quarks and gluons .",
    "the recent phenix data , shown in the left panel of fig .  [ fig : v2piap5 ] , show a spectrum of direct virtual photons from heavy ion collisions , compared with a similar sample from proton - proton collisions  @xcite .",
    "there is a notable excess in the lowest @xmath22 bins which can be fit by a simple exponential of slope @xmath23 mev .",
    "these data do not fully establish the temperature of the system at the very early times , as the measured spectrum is a convolution of spectra emitted during the whole collision evolution .",
    "still , they directly establish that the emitted photons were hotter than the hagedorn temperature at some point in the collision evolution .",
    "this suggests that the medium may well be the qgp , although this result _ per se _ does not point directly to quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "interestingly , comparisons of data for pions and protons shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : v2piap5 ] require a sharper transition than actually observed in lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "the detailed characterization of the medium formed at rhic requires a systematic variation of the initial conditions to measure its effects on the final state particles .",
    "such scans have been performed in other systems , e.g. ultra - cold atomic gases  @xcite .",
    "since soft physics involves the bulk production of particles from a thermalized system undergoing collective flow , one would want to vary the temperature , density and material properties in such a way to quantitatively extract the equation of state .",
    "unfortunately , the only tools available for heavy ion physics are colliding ion beams , for which one can only control the beam energy and nuclear size .",
    "it also possible to vary the centrality of the collision , which affects the shape of the overlap region .",
    "the most fundamental question addressed in all of these experimental studies is if the system is sufficiently thermalized in the initial state , such that it can properly be called a state of matter .",
    "once that is established , a whole series of questions arises , each of which addresses fundamental problems in strong interaction physics .",

    "* what are the conditions ( size , energy ) for thermalization ? * how rapidly is thermalization achieved ? *",
    "what degrees of freedom reach thermalization ( partons , hadrons , or something else ) ?    if it is assumed that the top - energy , most - central rhic collisions are in fact thermalized ( as suggested by their agreement with hydrodynamical models ) , it should be possible to vary the experimental parameters and `` turn off '' the creation of quark gluon plasma .",

    ", height=170 ]    55 mm        lowering the beam energy would seem to be a natural way to create a system that does not form a quark gluon plasma .",
    "however , it is essential to check if this leads to particle production different in some essential way than at higher energies .",
    "the inclusive charged particle multiplicity is a useful measurement for this , as it is a `` global '' observable , which integrates over time , space , and various degrees of freedom .",
    "the number of particles emitted essentially counts the degrees of freedom available to the system , which should be linear with the produced entropy in a fully thermalized system  @xcite .",
    "one empirically observed feature that should shed light on this is `` extended longitudinal scaling ''  @xcite .",
    "it has been observed in proton - proton collisions that the pseudorapidity density ( @xmath25 ) of inclusive charged particle production is energy - independent when viewed in a frame where one or other of the incoming particles is at rest  @xcite .",
    "this is done by using the kinematic variable @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the rapidity of one of the beams .",

    "the persistence of this scaling over a factor of ten in energy suggests that no major changes in the particle production occurs over this range .",
    "it also suggests that physics at @xmath29 is not obviously from a different origin than physics in the forward direction .",
    "what is surprising is that the same phenomena is common to all systems , from heavy ions to proton - proton , and even to @xmath24 annihilation .",
    "the latter system is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phobos - limfrag ] , which shows that the phenomenon is also not dependent on the overall system size  @xcite .",
    "it also shows an overlay of three au+au energies  @xcite , showing that the overall magnitude of multiplicity in heavy ion collisions and @xmath24 reactions is essentially the same , provided the au+au data is scaled down by the number of participant pairs ( @xmath30 ) . while this similarity between heavy ions and @xmath24 has been reported for several years  @xcite , it has not been fully explained .",
    "phobos data in ref .",
    "@xcite show that the elliptic flow parameter @xmath15 also obeys extended longitudinal scaling .",
    "this is surprising if the initial conditions at midrapidity are completely different to that at forward rapidities , but not if the initial entropy density and geometry are the primary determinants of elliptic flow , as should be the case if the viscosity is small .",
    "it has been shown by various experiments that the elliptic flow , normalized by the initial eccentricity , scales with the transverse particle density @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the area overlap of the initial collision  @xcite .",
    "however , this scaling breaks down when comparing au+au and cu+cu reactions if the `` standard '' eccentricity is used : @xmath33 , where @xmath34(@xmath35 ) is the variance in the direction along ( perpendicular to ) the reaction plane .",
    "fig.[fig : eccpart ] shows that scaling is restored by using an eccentricity defined by the distribution of the participants themselves  @xcite : @xmath36 .",

    "one is based on direct measurement of non - equilibrium processes , e.g. the behavior of charm quarks which are produced in the earliest stages .",
    "model calculations are used to relate the observed magnitude of @xmath15 with simultaneous measurements of suppression as a function of @xmath22 .",
    "phenix results  @xcite , shown in fig.[fig : phenix_charm_fig3 ] , find good agreement between the data and models assuming that @xmath39 .",
    "the other method is to systematically include viscous corrections into the hydrodynamic evolution , a technically challenging task which is being addressed by several competing teams  @xcite .",
    "an example of this from ref.@xcite is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phenix_charm_fig3 ] , and compared to phobos data .",
    "the main uncertainty in these calculations at present is the initial state ( e.g. whether the energy is distributed according to glauber models or according to the color glass condensate ) .",
    "however , the effect on @xmath38 is only about a factor of two , which suggests that rhic is quite close to the viscosity bound .",
    "if the near - perfect fluid description is relevant over most of the evolution , it is essential to determine the fluid constituents , and how they become a thermalized collective state of matter .",
    "nothing in the data discussed so far uniquely identifies which degrees of freedom are able to achieve this .",
    "the most natural assumption would be that the early stages are dominated by the dynamics of free quarks and gluons , or at least the dynamics of quark and gluon fields that are studied using lattice qcd .",
    "however , as shown above attempts to model the existing data on @xmath15 vs. @xmath22 for identified particles find that a strong first - order phase transition needs to be put in by hand  @xcite .",
