    "regions , that is , regions of photoionised gas , are among the most arresting astronomical objects at optical wavelengths . the basic theory behind their formation and expansion has been known for some time .",
    "more recently , attention has turned to explaining the irregular structures , filaments , globules and clumps seen within and around these regions .",
    "these could be due to underlying density inhomogeneities in the molecular cloud into which the region is expanding , or could be due to instabilities at the ionisation front itself .",
    "the effect of the stellar ionising radiation on these structures can lead to radiation driven implosion , and the subsequent compression could result in the formation of new stars .",
    "magnetic fields are well known to pervade molecular clouds and are thought to play an important role in regulating the star - formation process by providing support to collapsing structures in molecular clouds @xcite , although recently their relative importance in this process has become less clear @xcite .",
    "however , theoretical work on the interplay between ionising radiation and magnetic fields in and around regions has only been possible recently , with the advent of radiation - magnetohydrodynamic codes .",
    "@xcite performed the first simulations of the expansion of an region in a uniform , magnetised medium . at early times , the thermal pressure of the photoionised gas dominates over the magnetic field , which is pushed out of the expanding region . at late times",
    "( several myr ) , the photoionised region becomes elongated along the field lines and the magnetic field filled back in .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have studied the effects of ionising radiation on magnetised globules , finding that the photoevaporation process is significantly altered only when the magnetic pressure exceeds the thermal pressure by more than a factor of ten in the initial globule . @xcite",
    "have recently studied the combined effects of magnetic fields and photoionisation on the formation of a massive star on scales @xmath2  pc , finding that rotational winding of the field lines produces a magnetised ` bubble ' , whose magnetic pressure acts to confine the nascent h ii region during its ultracompact phase .    in this paper , we study the expansion of regions in non - uniform ( turbulent ) magnetised molecular clouds .",
    "previously , we studied region expansion in a turbulent medium without a magnetic field and our results were strikingly similar to observed regions @xcite . in the present work , we study the effect of the expanding photoionised gas on structures in the surrounding magnetised medium and also the effect that the turbulent magnetic field has on the region itself . at least at the relatively early times studied in our simulations ,",
    "most of the interesting effects due to the magnetic field will occur within the neutral , photon dominated region around the region , and so we use a careful treatment of the heating and cooling processes in this gas , first discussed in @xcite , in order to have a realistic portrayal of the dynamical processes here .",
    "the wealth of new observational data at infrared wavelengths enables comparisons to be made of our simulations not only with observations of the photoionised gas , as done previously in @xcite but also with the pdr and molecular gas affected by the region .",
    "in particular , the spitzer glimpse surveys of bubbles in the galactic plane highlight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission at the outer edges of regions and in pdrs .",
    "these surveys show that the thickness of the pah - emitting shell varies between 0.2 and 0.4 of the outer radius and that shell thickness increases approximately linearly with radius .",
    "moreover , the bubbles are generally non - spherical .",
    "herschel and apex observations reveal thermal emission from cold dust in the molecular gas outside the pdr .",
    "these observations are useful in identifying condensations that could be collapsing to form new stars .",
    "studies of magnetic fields in and around molecular clouds are important for understanding the star - formation process .",
    "there is no consensus as to the importance of magnetic fields in the formation of clouds , cores , and ultimately stars .",
    "if magnetic fields are dynamically important , then star formation is regulated by ambipolar diffusion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , if magnetic fields are unimportant then other processes such as turbulence and stellar feedback provide support to molecular clouds and determine the star - formation efficiency ( e.g. , ) .",
    "it is not known whether magnetic fields are strong enough to dynamically support molecular clouds and more evidence is needed .",
    "it is possible that reality lies somewhere between these extremes .",
    "recent zeeman observations of molecular clouds do not agree with predictions of idealized ambipolar diffusion models ( strong magnetic field ) but more observations are needed .",
    "there are three main techniques for tracing the magnetic field in diffuse hi and molecular clouds : polarisation from aligned dust grains , linear polarisation of spectral lines , and zeeman splitting of spectral lines @xcite .",
    "polarisation studies yield @xmath3 , the strength of the field projected onto the plane of the sky , whereas zeeman splitting gives @xmath4 , the strength of the field parallel to the line of sight .",
    "in particular , the zeeman effect has been used to study the atomic gas ( assumed to be in the photodissociated region ) in the star - forming regions m17 @xcite and the ophiuchus dark cloud complex @xcite , while the oh zeeman effect is used to study the line - of - sight magnetic field in the molecular gas .",
    "the results of such studies suggest that there is rough equipartition of magnetic and turbulent ( dynamical ) energy densities in the neutral gas . in the ophiuchus dark cloud region ,",
    "the uniform field in the gas is estimated to be 10.2  @xmath5 g @xcite , whereas the magnitude of the line - of - sight magnetic field strength in the gas associated with m17 is found to be @xmath6 g ( at @xmath7 resolution , or even twice as high at @xmath8 resolution ) @xcite , suggesting that there is small - scale structure in the magnetic field .",
    "recent linear polarisation studies at submillimetre wavelengths of the magnetic field around the ultracompact region g5.890.39 @xcite provide evidence for compression of the b field in the surrounding molecular cloud and general disturbance of the magnetic field caused by the expansion of the region .    for photoionised gas ,",
    "faraday rotation measures of line - of - sight extragalactic radio sources are used to calculate the magnetic field strengths in foreground regions @xcite .",
    "the zeeman effect can not be used in the ionised gas because the thermal linewidths are too large . @xcite use double extragalactic radio sources to sample two positions in the regions s117 and s264 and find identical rotation measures in each case of order 1 or @xmath9 g . in these regions ,",
    "the thermal energy density dominates the magnetic energy density . in a third region ,",
    "s119 , for which only a single rotation measure is available , the line - of - sight magnetic field strength is around 20  @xmath5 g and the ratio of magnetic to thermal energy density is around 0.4 , hence the magnetic field could have had an effect on the expansion of this region .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe our numerical algorithm and present two test problems : the classical spitzer law for the expansion of a non - magnetised h ii region in a uniform medium , and the expansion of an region in a uniform magnetised medium . in the second case",
    ", we draw attention to some interesting properties of the solution that have not been described previously .    in   [ sec : turbhii ] we describe the expansion of regions in both magnetised and non - magnetised turbulent media , taking as initial conditions for the ambient medium the results of an mhd turbulence calculation @xcite , and considering both a strong ( approximately o9 spectral type ) ionising source and a weak ( b0.5 ) one . in   [ sec : discussion ] we make qualitative comparisons between simulated optical and long - wavelength images and observations .",
    "we also produce synthetic maps of the projected line - of - sight and plane - of - sky components of the magnetic field , which can be qualitatively compared with observations of the magnetic field in star - forming regions .",
    "we discuss the globules and filaments at the periphery of our simulated regions in the context of recent numerical work on photoionised magnetised globules . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we outline our conclusions .",
    "the numerical method used in this paper is the same as that described by @xcite .",
    "the phab - c@xmath10 code combines the ideal magnetohydrodynamic code described by with the c@xmath10-ray method ( conservative causal ray ) for radiative transfer developed by @xcite , and adds a new treatment of the heating and cooling in the neutral gas @xcite .",
    "the mhd code is a second - order upwind scheme that integrates the ideal mhd equations using a godunov method with a riemann solver , similar to that described by @xcite but with the constrained transport ( ct ) method ( e.g. , @xcite ) used to maintain the divergence of the magnetic field close to zero .",
    "an artificial ( lapidus ) viscosity is also included @xcite in order to broaden the discontinuities and reduce oscillations . the c@xmath10-ray method for radiative",
    "transfer is explicitly photon conserving @xcite and the algorithm allows for timesteps much longer than the characteristic ionisation timescales or the timescale for the ionisation front to cross a numerical grid cell , by means of an analytical relaxation solution for the ionisation rate equations .",
    "this results in a highly efficient radiative transfer method .",
    "the mhd and radiative transfer codes are coupled via operator splitting , the inclusion of equations for the advection of ionised and neutral density in the mhd code , and the energy equation , which includes both radiative cooling and heating due to the absorption of stellar radiation by gas or dust : ionising extreme ultraviolet radiation in the photoionised region , non - ionising far ultraviolet radiation in the neutral gas and x - rays in the dense molecular gas . a detailed discussion of the heating and cooling contributions is given by @xcite .",
    "in particular , the treatment of heating in the neutral pdr region , taking into account fuv / optical dust heating and x - ray heating , is a substantial improvement over standard treatments in the literature .",
    "the heating term for the neutral gas is calibrated using cloudy @xcite and is tailored to the ionisation source .",
    "moreover , x - rays and fuv radiation will be enhanced due to the presence of associated low - mass stars in the star - formation environment , and we use the results of @xcite to estimate the distributions of fuv and euv fluxes appropriate to stellar clusters of membership sizes relevant to the two cases we study : an o9 and a b0.5 star",
    ". the energy equation is solved iteratively using substepping and the timestep for the whole calculation is determined solely by the magnetohydrodynamic timestep .",
    "the individual components of the phab - c@xmath10 code have been tested against standard problems and the whole code was applied to the problem of the photoionisation of magnetised globules @xcite , work which has recently been independently corroborated by @xcite . in this paper , we have implemented an entropy fix @xcite to correctly deal with the thermal and dynamical pressures in regions of low density where the magnetic pressure dominates . we have also improved the treatment of the boundary conditions because they can become important , particularly towards the end of the simulations . for our o star simulations we use outflow boundary conditions , since thermal pressure is expected to dominate throughout the evolution and the region will rapidly grow to the size of the computational box . for the b star simulations ,",
    "the expansion timescale of the region is much longer and is comparable to the crossing time of the computational box corresponding to the initial turbulent velocity dispersion of the molecular gas .",
    "we therefore use periodic boundary conditions in this case , which ensures that the total mass in the computational box remains constant .",
    "parallelisation using open - mp was implemented where possible , enabling the current simulations to be run in about two weeks on an intel 8-core server with 32  gb of ram .",
    "preliminary work was performed on the kan balam supercomputer of the universidad nacional autnoma de mxico .",
    "org/        the radiation part of the code has been extensively tested and documented . in order to test the radiation ( magneto-)hydrodynamics combined code we first consider the purely hydrodynamic evolution of a photoionised region around an ionising source in a uniform medium . the analytical solution to this problem",
    "is the familiar @xcite expansion law @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ionisation front radius , @xmath13 is the initial strmgren radius , @xmath14 is the sound speed in the ionised gas and @xmath15 is time , @xmath16 is the ionising photon rate , @xmath17 is the ambient density and @xmath18 is the case b recombination rate , @xmath19 @xcite , where @xmath20 is the temperature in the ionised gas . for an ambient density",

    "fig : nomhd_rad ] , together with the corresponding analytic solution .",
    "these parameters were chosen because they represent the mean values of the turbulent medium b star case described below in   [ sec : turbhii ] .",
    "the lower panel shows radius against time , while the upper panel shows the relative error , defined as @xmath25 from this figure , we see that the largest discrepancies , of about 6% , occur at the beginning of the expansion , when a shock wave begins to propagate outwards ahead of the ionisation front and a corresponding rarefaction wave travels back towards the ionising source , which is not accounted for in the analytical solution . at later times ,",
    "the error is never more than 1% .",
    "our code , therefore , compares extremely favorably with other radiation - hydrodynamics codes on this problem ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is no evidence for overcooling in the ionisation front in our simulations , as was found to be a problem by @xcite . in the analytic spitzer solution",
    "we assume an h ii region temperature @xmath26  k , which gives the best fit to our numerical result .",
    "this is about @xmath27  k hotter than the volume - averaged ionised gas temperature in our simulation , but is roughly equal to the ionised gas temperature just inside the ionisation front .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nomhd_vel ] we plot the gas radial velocity from the numerical simulation and the corresponding analytical solution .",
    "the numerical solution closely follows the analytical solution , though with oscillations due to acoustic phenomena , such as the initial rarefaction wave , which propagates back into the region when the ionization front begins to expand outwards .",
    "there is no corresponding analytical solution for the expansion of an region into a magnetised medium .",
    "therefore , in order to test the mhd part of the numerical code , we carry out a simulation of the expansion of an region in a uniform magnetised medium using the same parameters as those of @xcite .",
    "this problem was also used to test the radiation mhd code of @xcite .",
    "the simulation is performed in a @xmath28 computational box with constant ambient density and temperature of @xmath29  @xmath22 and @xmath30  k , respectively , a constant ambient magnetic field directed at @xmath31 to the @xmath32-axis in the @xmath32-@xmath33 plane - axis . ] of strength @xmath34 g and an ionising source producing @xmath35  ionising photons  s@xmath1 .",
    "the magnetic field is placed at an angle to the grid lines in order to be able to distinguish between physical and computational effects .",
    "we run the simulation in a @xmath36 box and in a @xmath37 box , the former to study the early evolution @xmath38  myr ) and the latter to highlight the late - time evolution .",
    "we note that the ionising source is very weak ( later than spectral type b0.5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that the ambient density is lower than that typically found in star - forming regions .",
    "@xcite found a critical radius and time for when magnetic pressure and tension start to become important for the expansion of the region in a uniform magnetised medium , which corresponds to when the magnetic pressure in the neutral gas becomes of the same order as the thermal pressure in the ionised gas , i.e. , @xmath39 . here ,",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath41 are the densities in the neutral and ionised gas , @xmath42 is the alfvn speed , and @xmath14 is the sound speed in the ionised gas .",
    "thus , magnetic effects become significant when the region has expanded to a radius of roughly @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the initial strmgren radius in a non - magnetised medium of the same uniform density .",
    "the corresponding time is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the sound crossing time of the initial strmgren sphere , and both of these equations implicitly assume that the classical spitzer expansion law @xcite holds until the magnetic field becomes important .    for the parameters in this test problem ,",
    "the initial strmgren radius is @xmath47  pc , and the alfvn speed in the ambient magnetised medium is @xmath48  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "our simulations give a temperature in the photoionised gas of @xmath49  k and hence a sound speed of @xmath50  km  s@xmath1 ( compare the lower assumed ionised sound speed @xmath51  km  s@xmath1 in the @xcite models ) .",

    "the coloured discs shown between the panels of the top row are keys to the interpretation of the magnetic field images .",
    "the hue indicates the projected field orientation in the plane of each cut ( red for vertical , cyan for horizontal , etc . ) , while the brightness indicates the magnetic field strength , as is shown in the left - hand disc .",
    "the colour saturation diminishes as the out - of - plane component of the field increases , as shown in the right - hand disk .",
    "this non - standard representation allows the magnetic field to be sampled at every pixel .",
    "the lower panels of the figures show the ionisation fraction , temperature and density of the gas in the same central planes .",
    "ionisation fraction is represented by colour : red indicates fully ionised gas while blue / green is partially ionised .",

    "the gas density is represented by the intensity in these figures , with the densest , cold molecular gas appearing white .    at early times , @xmath56 ,",
    "the region is essentially spherical and expands at approximately the same speed ( half the sound speed ) in all directions because the ionised gas thermal pressure is much higher than the ambient magnetic pressure .",
    "expansion across the magnetic field lines compresses the b - field .",
    "the expanding region and pdr are preceded by a fast - mode shock , which travels furthest perpendicular to the magnetic field direction . the fast - mode shock bends and compresses the field lines and so the pdr and region propagate in a modified magnetic field .",
    "the slow - mode shock is strongest along the field lines and most evident at the end caps , where it produces a dense shell .",
    "it compresses the gas and demagnetises it ( reduces the field ) .",
    "the slow - mode shock is almost isothermal and the dense shell behind it is pushed by the pressure in the photoionised region . at early times the magnetic field",
    "is reduced in the photoionised gas by the expansion of the region . at later times , @xmath57 ,",
    "the magnetic tension pulls the field back into the region at the equator .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : krum1 ] we show the situation after 2  myr , when the magnetic field has started to pull back into the region .",
    "the region is elongated along the magnetic field direction but the photon dominated region ( warm neutral gas ) is approximately spherical .",
    "the magnetic field retains its original direction except around the edge of the region .",
    "this is particularly evident at the poles of the region . at the time shown in the figure",
    ", the magnetic field appears concentrated towards the centre , with regions of lower magnetic field around the equator or waist of the structure .",
    "neutral gas is pulled into the region along with the magnetic field , becomes ionised and flows away from the ionisation front into the region .",
    "it then flows along the field lines and is channelled out towards the poles , where the ionisation front transforms into a recombination front .",
    "we note that at this time in the simulation , we do see instabilities form in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field , as reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these instabilities form at the equator where the ionisation front is parallel to the magnetic field direction because the slow - mode shock which precedes the ionisation front , is not permitted to cross the field lines . as a result , the ionisation front corrugates .    our fig .",
    "[ fig : krum2 ] shows the simulation after 6  myr in a @xmath58 computational box .",
    "the region has stopped expanding perpendicular to the magnetic field but the shocked neutral shell is still expanding along the field lines , leading to a very elongated structure . however , in the direction along the field lines , the flow has become one dimensional and so the density does not fall off as the region expands .",
    "thus , there is a limit as to how far the ionisation / recombination front can travel in this direction .",
    "there is an extended region of partially ionised gas beyond the recombination front .",
    "the warm , neutral gas ( pdr ) is still roughly spherical in shape but is pierced by the cigar - shaped region along the field direction .",
    "the dense neutral knots formed as a result of the instability at the equator shadow parts of the pdr .",
    "the knots formed closest to the perpendicular direction remain there throughout the simulation , pinned by the magnetic field .",
    "the knots slightly off the equator experience the rocket effect due to the photoionisation of their outer skins .",
    "they move like beads on a wire along the magnetic field lines around the edge of the region , a process which can be clearly observed in animations of this simulation . by the end of the calculation",

    "[ fig : mhd_rad ] and [ fig : mhd_vel ] , we examine the expansion of the magnetised region . fig .",
    "[ fig : mhd_rad ] shows the evolution of the radius of the photoionised region with time .",
    "the mean radius is consistently below the classical spitzer expansion law , unlike the non - magnetic case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nomhd_rad ] ) . in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field",
    ", the expansion slows with time , as shown by the evolution of the minimum radius . in the direction along the field lines ,",
    "the expansion initially ( @xmath59  myr ) follows the classical spitzer law but then accelerates as material is channelled along the field lines and out of the poles of the region .",
    "this expansion abruptly stops just after 4  myr , which corresponds to the time when the ionisation front can no longer expand along the field lines because the flow has become one dimensional .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhd_vel ] the mean radial and root - mean - square ( rms ) velocities of the ionised gas are plotted together with the analytical value and also the mean velocity of the ionisation front .",
    "the discontinuity at 2  myr is due to the change in resolution of the simulation .",
    "the calculated values are all above the analytical values and indicate that typical velocities in the photoionised gas are of the order 12  km  s@xmath1 throughout the simulated lifetime of the region .",
    "the mean radial velocity shows the same sort of ringing that we saw in the non - magnetised simulation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nomhd_vel ] ) .",
    "after about 3  myr , the gas velocities become dominated by the one - dimensional flow being channelled along the field lines .",
    "in this section we describe the results of radiation mhd simulations of region expansion in a more realistic medium where neither the initial density distribution nor magnetic field are uniform .",
    "we consider both an o star ionising flux and one more appropriate to a b star in order to study the effect of the magnetic field on the ionised gas and on the neutral gas of the pdr .      as initial conditions",
    "we take the results of a @xmath28 driven - turbulence , ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulation by @xcite , specifically the simulation with initial isothermal mach number @xmath60 , jeans number @xmath61 and plasma beta @xmath62 .",
    "the original @xcite simulations are scale free and are characterised by the three nondimensional quantities @xmath63 ( the rms sonic mach number of the turbulent velocity dispersion @xmath64 ) , @xmath65 ( the jeans number , giving the size of the computational box @xmath66 in units of the jeans length @xmath67 ) , and the plasma beta , @xmath68 ( ratio of thermal to magnetic pressures ) .",
    "we set the scaling by choosing the computational box size to be 4  pc , giving the ambient temperature as @xmath69  k , the mean atomic number density as @xmath70  @xmath22 and the mean magnetic field strength as @xmath71 g . we choose as our starting point the time in the evolution when there is one collapsing object . at this point ,",
    "the mean values of the magnetic field the number density are unchanged , since flux and mass are conserved , while the mean plasma beta is now @xmath72 , which is consistent with the rms value of the magnetic field @xmath73 g .",
    "that is , the turbulence has enhanced the rms magnetic field by a factor @xmath74 , which leads to a change by a factor @xmath75 in the value of @xmath76 over the original , uniform conditions .",
    "as in our previous paper @xcite , we place our ionising source in the centre of the collapsing object , remove @xmath77 of material ( corresponding to the mass of the star formed ) and take advantage of the periodic boundary conditions of the turbulence simulation to move the source to the centre of the grid .",
    "we also subtract the source velocity from the whole grid .",
    "we consider two ionising sources : one corresponds approximately to an o9 star @xcite , having an effective temperature @xmath24  k and an ionising photon rate of @xmath78  photons  s@xmath1 , while the other ionising source has @xmath79  photons  s@xmath1 , which corresponds to b0.5 .      in this section",
    "we present our results both for the o star and the b star and in each case for the magnetic and also for the purely hydrodynamic simulations . in this way we can assess the importance of the magnetic field and the ionising photon flux on the evolving structures in the expanding regions and surrounding neutral gas .",
    "we first present emission - line images of the simulated regions for both o and b stars in the magnetic and pure hydrodynamic cases when they have reached a similar size , which corresponds to 200,000  yrs of evolution for the o star case and @xmath80  yrs of evolution in the b star case .",
    "this permits a direct comparison with observations at optical and longer wavelengths .",
    "we then examine the expansion and time evolution of the ionised , neutral and molecular components using global statistical properties .",
    "the importance of the magnetic field in the different components is then studied for the particular o and b star simulations presented earlier .",
    "although the ionised / neutral transition of hydrogen is treated explicitly in a detailed manner in our radiation - mhd code , the neutral / molecular transition is treated much more approximately .",
    "we simply assume that the molecular fraction is a predetermined function of the extinction @xmath81 from the central star to each point in our simulation : @xmath82 , which was determined by fitting to the cloudy models described in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "a rough estimate of the importance of the magnetic field in our turbulent media simulations can be obtained by calculating the critical radius and timescale , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( see eqs .",
    "[ eq : rm ] and [ eq : tm ] ) , for the initial value of the magnetic field and the mean density . using @xmath85 g and @xmath86  @xmath22 , and assuming a mean particle mass of 1.3  m@xmath87 , the initial representative alfvn speed in the neutral gas is @xmath88  km  s@xmath1 . in the photoionised gas ,",
    "the sound speed is @xmath89  km  s@xmath1 . for the strong ionising source ( o star )",
    ", the strmgren radius in a uniform medium of density equal to the mean density would be @xmath90  pc , giving a critical radius @xmath91  pc and time @xmath92  myr for when the magnetic field starts to become important .",
    "if , instead of the rms magnetic field we use the mean magnetic field , @xmath93 g , then the corresponding values are @xmath94  pc and @xmath95  myr . for the weak ionising source ( b star ) , the numbers are @xmath96  pc , @xmath97  pc ( @xmath98  pc ) and @xmath99  myr ( @xmath100  myr ) depending on whether the rms or mean magnetic field is considered .",
    "thus , for the strong ionising source , the critical diameter is larger than the dimension of the computational box , hence we do not expect that the magnetic field would have much effect on the expansion of the region in this case . however , for the weak ionising source , it is not clear whether the rms or the mean value of the magnetic field is most important for determining the global evolution of the region . if the rms field is the determining parameter then the fact that the critical diameter in this case is smaller than the size of the computational box leads us to expect that the magnetic field will affect the global expansion of the region . on the other hand , if it turns out that the mean magnetic field is most important , then the effect will not be noticed within our computational size and timescales .",
    "furthermore , given the non - uniform initial conditions , the timescale for the magnetic field to become important could vary depending on the local gas sound speed to alfvn speed ratio .",
    "we start our comparison by considering the morphological appearance of the regions and the surrounding neutral and molecular material . in figs .",
    "[ fig : images_o ] and [ fig : images_b ] we show two types of image data , one showing mostly the ionised gas , where the different colours represent emission from optical emission lines , the other shows synthetic , long - wavelength ( infrared and radio ) emission , emphasizing the neutral and molecular material .    the optical emission was calculated as described in our previous papers @xcite , assuming heavy element ionisation fractions that are fixed functions of the hydrogen ionisation fractions . for the b star models",

    "scattering by dust is not included .    for the long - wavelength images",
    "the emission bands were chosen to give a more global view of the simulations than can be provided by the optical emission lines .",

    "depending on the initial field orientation with respect to the direction of the ionising photons , either extreme flattening of the globule may occur ( perpendicular orientations ) or the radiative implosion of the globule may be prevented ( parallel orientations ) .",
    "for all orientations the ionised photoevaporation flow can not freely escape from the globule , leading to recombination at late times .",
    "on the other hand , a weaker field ( @xmath125 in the initial globule ) leads only to a moderate flattening of the globule and does not prevent the free escape of the ionised photoevaporation flow .    in our turbulent simulations ,",
    "the mean initial value of @xmath76 is @xmath126 (   [ sec : setup ] ) , which is intermediate between the two cases discussed above and might lead one to suspect that magnetic effects on the evolution of globules should be substantial . however ,",
    "this is _ not _ the case .",
    "a careful examination of the three - dimensional globule morphologies in our simulations shows no evidence of magnetically induced flattening .",
    "although many globules do show asymmetries , this is true equally of our non - magnetic simulations and is presumably due to their irregular initial shape and internal turbulent motions .",
    "the only difference in the globule properties between our non - magnetic and magnetic simulations is that the very smallest globules do not seem to form in the magnetic case .    in order to explain this apparent discrepancy with earlier work ,",
    "it is necessary to examine in more detail the distribution of magnetic field in the initial conditions of our turbulent simulations .",
    "it turns out that the dense filaments of molecular gas ( from which the globules will ultimately form ) tend to be much less magnetically dominated than the more diffuse gas , typically showing @xmath127 .",
    "furthermore , these filaments already show a magnetic geometry similar to that described above (   [ sec : pred - maps - proj ] ) , with the field running along the long axis of the filament and with the field changing sign as one moves across the short axis .",
    "this is very different from the initial conditions assumed in the earlier globule photoevaporation studies , which were a uniform magnetic field that threaded a spherical globule ( e.g. , fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "as a result , the compressed globule heads in our turbulent simulations show approximately equal thermal and magnetic pressures ( @xmath128 ) and the magnetic effects are very modest .",
    "one caveat to this result is that numerical diffusion due to our limited spatial resolution may be producing non - physical magnetic reconnection in the globule head when oppositely directed field lines are forced together .",
    "higher resolution studies of globule implosion with realistic initial field configurations are required in order to clarify this and these should also include self gravity , which may be important during the phase of maximum compression @xcite .",
    "we have performed radiation - magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the formation and expansion of regions and pdrs around an o star and a b star in a turbulent magnetised molecular cloud on scales of up to 4  parsec .",
    "our principal conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "the expansion of the region is little affected by the presence of the magnetic field , since the thermal pressure of the ionised gas dominates the dynamics on the timescales of our simulations (   [ sec : glob - prop - prot ] ) .",
    "the o star simulations produce greater fragmentation and denser clumps and filaments around the periphery of the region than the b star case (   [ sec : morph ] , figs .",
    "[ fig : images_o ] and [ fig : images_b ] ) .",
    "3 .   for b stars",
    "the non - ionising far ultraviolet radiation plays an important role in determining the morphology of the region .",
    "regions around such stars are surrounded by a thick , relatively smooth shells of neutral material ( pdr ) , @xmath102 of the bubble radius ( e.g. , lower panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : cuts_bstar ] ) . in the o star simulations ,",
    "the pdr is thinner and more irregular in shape ( e.g. , fig .  [",
    "fig : images_o ] ) .",
    "the resemblance at optical and longer wavelengths of our simulations to observed bubbles is striking (   [ subsec : rcw120 ] and ) .",
    "our @xmath129  pc radius bubbles are a typical size compared to bubbles at known distances in the glimpse surveys @xcite , and so comparisons are meaningful .",
    "5 .   the expanding region and pdr tend to erase pre - existing small - scale disordered structure in the magnetic field , producing a large - scale ordered field in the neutral shell , with orientation approximately parallel to the ionisation front ( top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : cuts_bstar ] and top - right panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : bproj - ostar - full ] and [ fig : bproj - bstar - full ] ) . 6 .",
    "dense evaporating globules , pillars , and elephant trunk structures tend to be fed by two or more neutral / molecular filaments , with magnetic fields running along their length ( right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : bproj - ostar - globule ] and bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bproj - bstar - globule ] ) .",
    "the field geometry in the neutral and molecular gas at the bright head of the structure tends to be of a hairpin shape .",
    "the weak magnetic field in the ionised gas also shows an ordered structure . on the largest scales and at the latest times , it tends to align ( albeit weakly in the o star case ) , with the mean field direction of the simulation s initial conditions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bproj - bstar - full ] , top - left panel ) . on smaller scales",
    ", there is a general ( but not universal ) tendency for the field in ionised gas to be oriented perpendicular to the local ionisation front .",
    "this tendency is more pronounced in the o star simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bproj - ostar - full ] , top - left panel ) and in globule evaporation flows for both simulations ( top - left panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : bproj - ostar - globule ] and [ fig : bproj - bstar - globule ] ) . 8 .",
    "the highest pressure compressed neutral / molecular gas shows approximate equipartition between thermal , turbulent , and magnetic energy density , whereas lower pressure gas ( either neutral or molecular ) tends to separate into , on the one hand , magnetically dominated , quiescent regions , and , on the other hand , demagnetised , highly turbulent regions (   [ sec : magnetic - quantities ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : pram_pmag_bstar ] ) .",
    "the lower pressure gas also separates into low-@xmath76 , magnetically dominated regions ( which are largely molecular ) and high-@xmath76 , thermally dominated regions ( which are largely neutral ) .",
    "the ionised gas , on the other hand , always shows approximate equipartition between thermal and turbulent energies , but with the magnetic energy being lower by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "velocity dispersions in the ionised gas of @xmath130@xmath131  @xmath132 are maintained for the entire duration of all our simulations (   [ sec : glob - prop - prot ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : comp3_o ] and [ fig : comp3_b ] ) .",
    "this is 5 to 10 times higher than the value that would be predicted by expansion in a uniform medium . at early times ( @xmath133  yr for the o star , or @xmath134  yr for the b star )",
    ", this dispersion is mainly due to radial champagne - flow expansion as the h ii region escapes from its natal clump . at later times",
    ", the net radial expansion of ionised gas subsides , but the velocity dispersion is maintained by inwardly - directed photoevaporation flows from globules and pillars .",
