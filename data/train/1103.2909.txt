    "expanding shells are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium .",
    "they are driven by energetic phenomena of massive stars , such as emission of ionizing photons , stellar winds , and supernova explosions . recently , using 102 samples identified as shell , @xcite found evidences of the star formation in more than a quarter of the shells , suggesting that the triggered star formation by hii regions may be an efficient process of the massive star formation .",
    "theoretically , @xcite presented a sequential star formation scenario where the massive star formation takes place through gravitational fragmentation of the expanding shell that is driven by hii regions surrounding massive stars , and newly formed massive star also triggers the formation of next generation .    to understand the triggered star formation , it is important to investigate how and when the expanding shell fragments through the gravitational instability ( gi ) .",
    "earliest studies were done by using linear analyses of the static dense gas layer confined by the same thermal pressures of hot rarefied gases on both sides @xcite .",
    "they showed that the gi begins to develop with a scale comparable to the layer thickness and with a growing timescale comparable to the free - fall time of the layer .",
    "however , their linear analyses are oversimplified because the actual shells are confined by the shock front ( sf ) on the leading surface and the contact discontinuity ( cd ) , or the ionization front ( if ) on the trailing surface",
    ". moreover , an unbalance between the ram pressure and the thermal pressure causes a decelerating or an accelerating expansion .",
    "many authors have tackled the stability analyses with these effects by mainly using the thin - shell approximation where the perturbed variables are averaged across the thickness .",
    "the stability analysis of expanding shells has been investigated by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "they took into account dilution effects of perturbations owing to the expansion and the mass accretion .",
    "their linear analyses of expanding shells neglected the structure across the thickness and the boundary effect of the cd .",
    "thus , how these effects that they neglected influence the gi have been unknown yet .",
    "@xcite investigated stability of asymmetric layers , and found that the asymmetry of the density profile of the shell greatly influences the development of the gi . moreover , by using shock - like boundary conditions , he found that the different choice of the boundary condition greatly modifies the dispersion relation .",
    "however , their analysis is limited to be in the incompressible fluid .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a linear analysis taking into account the structure across the thickness and the effects of boundaries , i.e. , the sf on the leading surface and the cd on the trailing surface . in order to determine the density profile all the time , we develop a semi - analytic method that well describes the one - dimensional ( 1d ) evolution .",
    "this paper extends the study of @xcite to include the compressible effect and the more realistic density profile by taking into account the radial self - gravitational force @xcite .",
    "we neglect the effects of expansion and mass accretion through the sf .    in this paper ,",
    "since we focus on investigation of how the boundary effects and asymmetric density profiles influence the gi , we do not apply our result to estimate fragmentation time and scale .",
    "we will perform three - dimensional simulation of expanding shells to compare with the results of the linear analysis , and present detailed quantitative aspects of the fragmentation process of expanding shells in a subsequent paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* submitted ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : hii ] , we present a thin - shell model of the expanding shell driven by the hii region . in section [ sec : unp ] , we develop a semi - analytic method to derive time evolution of the density profile .",
    "we investigate influences of the asymmetric density profile on the dispersion relation of the gi by considering pressure - confined layer in section [ sec : asym ] . in section [ sec : shell ] , we perform linear analysis of expanding shells by using density profile obtained in section [ sec : unp ] and by imposing the approximate sf and the cd boundary conditions . in section [ sec : discuss ] , we compare our results with previous works .",

    "* ) , the if initially expands with a supersonic speed with respect to the sound speed of ionized gas , @xmath5 .",
    "the hii region begins to expand by the pressure difference between the hii region and the ambient gas when the if reaches the strmgren radius , @xmath6 given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 indicate the case - b recombination coefficient . in this phase",
    ", the sf emerges in front of the if and sweeps up the ambient gas into a dense shell .",
    "this paper focuses on the evolution of the shell after the shock emerges .",
    "the equation of motion of the shell is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total mass of the shell , i.e. the mass of the ambient gas that initially occupied the volume of the hii region , @xmath11 is the mean radius of the shell and @xmath12 is the thermal pressure of the hii region .",
    "here , we neglect the pressure of the ambient gas and the thickness of the shell . in the hii region , the detailed balance between the recombination and the ionization is approximately established all the time .",
    "therefore , @xmath12 can be expressed using @xmath11 as follows : @xmath13 using equation ( [ pii ] ) , we obtain the solution of equation ( [ eom shell ] ) , @xmath14 @xcite . equations ( [ eom shell ] ) and ( [ thin - shell ] ) are valid only in the early phase .",
    "as the shell sweeps up the ambient gas and increases its mass , the self - gravity influences the expansion .",
    "the equation of motion including the self - gravity becomes @xmath15 where the second term on the right - hand side represents the self - gravitational force @xcite .",
    "the factor of @xmath16 in the self - gravity term arises because the gravitational acceleration vanishes at the inner surface , it is @xmath17 at the outer surface , and the mass - weighted average across the thickness is @xmath18 .",
    "one can see that the self - gravity slows the expansion in equation ( [ eom shell grav ] ) .    in this paper , for convenience ,",

    "[ fig : quv n ] , it is seen that as the shell expands , the lines quickly approach to an asymptotic line that is independent of the parameters .",

    "@xcite derived similar thin - shell equations for the shells driven by steady stellar winds .",
    "they found a change of the power - law index ( from 3/5 to 1/5 ) at the time when the self - gravity starts to be important . in the gravity dominated phase",
    ", the shell expands keeping the force balance between the thermal pressure of the hot bubble and the self - gravity . in the stellar wind case",
    ", the steady energy input allows the outward expansion of the shell ( @xmath46 ) even when the self - gravity becomes important . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case with the hii regions , from equation ( [ eom shell nondim ] ) , the gravitational force ( @xmath47 ) increases more rapidly than the pressure force by the hii region ( @xmath48 ) , suggesting that the shell begins to collapse toward the center at a certain radius . in the numerical calculation",
    ", it occurs at @xmath49 in all parameters .",
    "the last term of equation ( [ eom shell nondim ] ) is valid until only the expansion phase .",

    "they may influence the dynamics of the shell in the self - gravity dominated phase . in this paper , for simplicity , we focus on the expansion phase by the ionizing photon .",
    "in this section , we derive the time evolution of the density profile of the shell in a semi - analytic way .",
    "we assume that the shell is in instantaneous hydrostatic equilibrium at each instant of time .",
    "this is reasonable assumption because the shell is very thin and the sound - crossing time across the thickness is very short compared with the expansion timescale .",

    "the poisson equation is @xmath52 where the curvature effect is neglected because @xmath11 is much larger than the thickness .",
    "we confirmed that the curvature effect is negligible by comparing density profiles with and without curvature effect . substituting equation ( [ hydrostatic ] ) into equation ( [ poisson ] ) ,",

    "is determined by the condition of the force balance at @xmath60 .",
    "the gravitational force must vanish at @xmath60 because the total mass of the hot bubble is negligible .",

    "the wavenumber of the most unstable mode is not different so much .",
    "one can see that the square growth rate in large wavenumber is proportional to @xmath184 while the square growth rate for @xmath183 is proportional to @xmath185 .",

    "this is the case with a static shell with @xmath189 ( equation ( [ hydrostatic ] ) ) .",
    "@xcite investigated this situation including shell curvature and found that the shell is unstable for all wavenumber ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "for @xmath190 , the square growth rate increases as @xmath184 with wavenumbers because @xmath191 ( equation ( [ hydrostatic ] ) ) .",
    "this is well - known scaling law of the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "the enhancement of the growth rate for @xmath192 arises from the combination of the gi and the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "in previous section , we focus on the effect of asymmetry of the density profile by imposing the same boundary conditions in both boundaries . in this section , in a more realistic situation , we investigate the stability of expanding shells driven by the expansion the hii region . the unperturbed density profile at each instant of time is given by the semi - analytic method presented in section [ sec : unp ] .",
    "we neglect the curvature effect and solve the perturbation equations ( [ eoc per])-([poi per ] ) but @xmath193 . in this case , as well as in the asymmetric density profile , the difference of boundary properties between leading ( the sf ) and trailing ( the cd ) surfaces plays important roles in the gi .      before presenting a linear analysis",
    ", we review how the sf and the cd influence the gi through the boundary effect .",
    "this point is important in understanding the results of the linear analysis . in the early phase , the shell",
    "is highly confined by the ram pressure on the leading surface and by the thermal pressure on the trailing surface . in this phase ,",
    "the pressure at boundaries is as large as that at the density maximum , and the thickness of the shell is much smaller than the scale height , @xmath194 , where @xmath56 is the maximum density .",
    "thus , in this phase , the boundary effect can strongly influence the gi . in the later phase , the boundary effect of the cd",
    "is expected to be also important because the density peak is close to the cd as shown in section [ sec : den evo ] . in this section ,",
    "we summarize how the growth rate of gi is controlled by the different boundary conditions .",
    "for simplicity , in section [ sec : influence ] , the layer is assumed to be symmetric with respect to the mid - plane , and physical variables are averaged across the thickness .",
    "many authors have investigated influences of the sf on the gi @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relation of the shock - confined layer is given by @xmath195 where @xmath65 is the column density , and @xmath149 is the transverse wavenumber of the perturbation .",
    "this dispersion relation is the same as that for the infinitesimally thin layer . in the highly confined layer",
    ", it is well known that the perturbation behaves like incompressible mode because the sound - crossing time over the thickness is much smaller than the free - fall timescale , @xmath196 @xcite .",
    "therefore , density fluctuation is small .",
    "the layer becomes unstable mainly by the deformation of the surfaces that makes the perturbation of the gravitational potential deeper .",
    "hereafter , we call this mode the `` incompressible mode ''",
    ". the deformation of the sf generates the tangential flow carrying the gas from the convex to the concave regions ( seen from the downstream ) .",
    "therefore , the tangential flow tends to make the sf flat , suggesting that it suppresses the growth of the gi . in the shock - confined layer ,",
    "the restoring term @xmath197 arises from the tangential flow behind the oblique sf . on the other hand , in the case of the infinitesimally thin layer ,",
    "this term comes from the pressure gradient .",
    "therefore , the origin of the restoring force is quite different . from equation ( [ disp shock ] ) , the maximum growth rate is given by @xmath198 , and the corresponding wavenumber is given by @xmath199 .",
    "when @xmath65 is small ( @xmath200 , the maximum growth rate is smaller than the inverse of the free - fall timescale , @xmath201 , and the corresponding scale is larger than the scale height @xmath202 that is comparable to the jeans scale .",
    "next , we review the influence of the cd on the gi .",
    "we consider the layer confined by thermal pressure of hot rarefied gases ( cd boundary condition ) on both sides .",
    "the dispersion relation becomes @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the thickness of the layer , and we consider the large - scale limit where @xmath205 .",
    "detailed derivation of equation ( [ disp pre ] ) is shown in appendix 3 of @xcite . in the pressure - confined layer ,",
    "the stabilization effect of the tangential flow does not exist .",
    "therefore , the restoring term in equation ( [ disp pre ] ) is quite different from that in equation ( [ disp shock ] ) . using the gravitational acceleration at the surfaces as @xmath206",
    ", we can express the restoring term in equation ( [ disp pre ] ) by @xmath207 .",
    "therefore , one can see that the restoring force arises from the surface gravity wave .",
    "the layer with the cd boundary condition is less stabilized compared with the shock boundary condition because the phase velocity of the gravity wave @xmath208 is much smaller than @xmath209 when @xmath210 . from the dispersion relation ( [ disp pre ] ) , the maximum growth rate is comparable to the inverse of the free fall time of the layer @xmath211 , and the corresponding wavelength is about the thickness of the layer , @xmath212 @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can see that the most unstable mode in the pressure - confined layer has a larger growth rate and a smaller scale than the shock - confined layer ( see figure 9 of * ? ? ? * in detail ) .",
    "equations ( [ disp shock ] ) and ( [ disp pre ] ) can not be applied directly in the gi of the expanding shells because the gi is expected to be stabilized by evolutionary effects , such as the expansion of the shell and the accretion of fresh gas through the sf .",
    "@xcite derived the following approximate dispersion relation , @xmath213 the terms with @xmath214 come from evolutionary effects that stabilize the gi .",
    "one can see that equation ( [ disp elme ] ) for the limit of @xmath215 is the same as equation ( [ disp shock ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xcite and @xcite essentially applied equation ( [ disp shock ] ) in the context of the gi of the expanding shell .",
    "however , they did not take into account the boundary effect of the cd on the trailing surface .",
    "comparing equations ( [ disp shock ] ) and ( [ disp pre ] ) , we suggest that the stability of the thin shell neglecting the effect of the cd is suffered by large stabilizing effect , and it will underestimate the growth rate of gi in expanding shells .      first , we assume that a constant pressure exerts on the cd all the time ( the cd boundary condition ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath216 and @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the displacement of the cd .",
    "next , let us consider the boundary conditions at @xmath219 .",
    "since the unperturbed state is assumed to be the hydrostatic configuration , it is impossible to impose the shock boundary conditions self - consistently .",
    "in order to treat it self - consistently , time - dependent initial value problem is needed to be solved @xcite .",

    "the reason why we adopt @xmath221 is that the thin - shell linear analysis of the layer confined by rigid surfaces gives the same dispersion relation as that of the shock - confined layer ( equation ( [ disp shock ] ) ) . in",
    "more precisely , in the shock - confined layer , the tangential flow boosts the suppression effect against the self - gravity as mentioned in section [ sec : shock ] .",

    "the effect of the vi is discussed in section [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "the numerical method is the same as that in section [ sec : numerical ] .      as shown in section [ sec : scaling den ] , it is found that the density profiles are characterized by a single parameter @xmath227 .",
    "this is because the scale height , the peak density , and the free fall time have the scaling laws with respect to @xmath227 as shown in equations ( [ h sou])-([t sou ] ) .",

    "therefore , we compare the results of the linear analysis with the dispersion relation of the shock - confined layer ( equation ( [ disp shock ] ) ) rather than that of the expanding shell ( equation ( [ disp elme ] ) ) .",
    "one can see that the growth rate is larger than the prediction from the shock - confined layer . as shown in section [ sec : influence ] , this difference comes from the boundary effect of the cd .",
    "therefore , the shell is expected to begin to grow earlier and to fragment more quickly than the prediction from @xcite that is based on equation ( [ disp shock ] ) .",

    "this indicates that the gas in @xmath262 can not collapse to the peak because the sound wave can travel from @xmath55 to @xmath62 many times within the free fall time .",
