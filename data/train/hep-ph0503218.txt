    "high - energy hadrons in extensive air showers offer a unique possibility to study interaction features well beyond the kinematic and energy region of earthbound accelerators . in particular , structures in hadronic shower cores might reflect properties of the particle production at an initial stage of the shower development .",
    "for example , the eas - top collaboration investigated multicore events recorded in the calorimeter and studied the cross - section of large @xmath3 jet production in proton - air collisions  @xcite . in other studies ,",
    "data taken by the kascade scintillator array and hadron calorimeter  @xcite were used to investigate different aspects of hadronic interaction models .",
    "the correlation of the hadronic to the muonic and electromagnetic shower components  @xcite , as well as features of the particle production in the very forward region of nucleon - air collisions  @xcite were measured and compared to model predictions .",
    "geometric structures in hadronic shower cores at observation level are particularly interesting , as one expects qcd jet production to lead to secondary hadrons being naturally aligned to form line shape patterns  @xcite . similar alignment structures might result from exotic hadron production processes @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the observation of aligned structures in a number of emulsion chamber experiments has initiated considerable experimental and theoretical efforts over the last two decades  @xcite .",
    "aligned event structures were , for instance , reported by the pamir experiment  @xcite .",
    "an excess of events with substructure alignment above background fluctuations was found in the data for primary energies above an energy threshold of 8@xmath410  pev ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the most energetic event of @xmath510  pev that was measured in an emulsion experiment during flights with the concorde airplane also shows alignment  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , alignment was found in another individual high - energy event , estimated to have an energy @xmath610  pev , that was detected by a balloon borne emulsion chamber  @xcite .",
    "the experimental evidence of the existence of an alignment phenomenon , i.e.  events with substructures being located in a line occurring more frequently than expected , is debated controversially , including the possibility of the excess being due to statistical fluctuations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    at lower energy , no excess of aligned structures in air showers or direct experiments was observed . at energies of a few pev",
    "the fraction of elongated events measured by pamir was found to agree with the expectations from background fluctuations .",
    "the fraction of elongated events of similar energy recorded by the kanbala air shower experiment  @xcite gave also no indication of a significant excess over the simulated background .",
    "measurements of the balloon experiment runjob in a primary energy range of 0.01@xmath40.1  pev have shown that the fraction of aligned events agreed with the background expectation  @xcite .",
    "also the less energetic events recorded during the concorde flights showed no excess alignment .    a search for such alignment phenomena at accelerators was performed at comparatively low collision energy of 250  gev in @xmath7@xmath4au interactions .",
    "no significant excess of elongated events was found in data of the cern experiment na22  @xcite .",
    "various theoretical efforts , partly hampered by the limited experimental guidance , were performed to explain alignment by physics mechanisms .",
    "it was pointed out in  @xcite that dynamical features of standard qcd jet production might give rise to observable alignment . in",
    "@xcite it was emphasized that the observations would indicate aligned particle production in the fragmentation region of the collision rather than in the central region . a connection of alignment to the production of secondaries with high transverse momentum",
    "was suggested e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of an anti - shadow scattering mode at high collision energies as source of alignment was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "an onset of semi - hard double inelastic diffraction was proposed in  @xcite , where alignment results as projection from the rupture of a quark - gluon string .",
    "the existence of a new particle with a long mean free path , produced in a new type of interaction , was also proposed to explain the pamir observation  @xcite .",
    "simulations based on phenomenological models were compared to the pamir data in  @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that alignment features produced , e.g. , in the first interaction of the primary cosmic ray in air can be washed out by subsequent interactions during the shower evolution .",
    "while the existence of alignment features is out of doubt , the main questions concerning their nature are : to what extent can such structures observed in the data be related to specific particle production and interaction mechanisms ? are new particles or interaction channels , maybe above a certain collision energy threshold , required to explain the data ?    in this work , geometric structures in hadronic shower cores recorded by the kascade experiment are investigated . both , the alignment of hadrons in shower cores and the distance between hadrons are analyzed and compared to detailed monte carlo simulations .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ cuts ] , relevant features of the kascade detector and the applied data selection are described .",

    "a detailed description of the kascade detector performance and the standard reconstruction procedures for the array and calorimeter data is given in  @xcite .",
    "for the analysis , data collected by the kascade experiment in the period from may 1998 to april 2001 have been used .",

    "the energy , position and direction of individual hadrons with energies @xmath050  gev are reconstructed from the measurements performed with the hadron calorimeter .",
    "the following selection criteria are applied to the data : + ( i ) the reconstructed primary energy of the air shower ( @xmath11 @xmath525% ) is @xmath01  pev , and the primary zenith angle is @xmath1230@xmath13 ( @xmath14 @xmath51@xmath13 ) .",

    "+ the effect of the latter condition is small even at lower primary energies , reducing the data set by @xmath513% .    in total , 4489 events are selected this way .",
    "after transformation into the shower plane , the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see below ) are evaluated for each event .",

    "commonly , the degree of alignment is described by a parameter @xmath1  @xcite quantifying the angular correlation between the four most - energetic particles ( or particle clusters ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the angle between the lines connecting particle @xmath20 to @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "possible values range between @xmath23 ( isotropic distribution ) and @xmath24 ( perfect alignment ) .",

    "it has been checked explicitely that adopting other values for the primary energy slope or , e.g. , including a _ knee _ structure does not influence the calculated @xmath1 distribution , as will be also clear from the following discussion .",
    "the shower simulation is followed by a detailed detector simulation based on geant  @xcite .",
    "the same reconstruction algorithms and selection criteria are applied to simulations and data .",
    "the simulation statistics is of comparable size to the data statistics for each primary .",
    "[ fig - kco ] shows that the measured @xmath1 distribution and the fraction of aligned events are well reproduced by the standard calculations , without the need of introducing new particles or non - standard interaction features .",
    "moreover , despite the much smaller initial energy per nucleon in case of iron showers , no significant difference between proton and iron induced events is observed .",

    "events with aligned hadronic structures could be the result of jet production in hadronic interactions during the shower development  @xcite .",
    "the jet pair and the hadrons from projectile fragmentation are naturally aligned in one plane and the expected geometric separation falls in the range measurable with kascade .",
    "for example , the projected separation from the initial direction of a 10  tev  hadron produced at an altitude of 15  km with a transverse momentum @xmath27  gev is 7.5  m at kascade observation level .    to investigate the correlation between the angular distribution of particles in hadronic interactions and geometric structures ,",
    "a simulation was carried out in which the azimuth angles of the produced secondary particles are picked at random in the centre - of - mass system of the collision , keeping the transverse and longitudinal momenta unchanged . in this way , any angular correlation of produced particles is eliminated .",
    "the results of calculations performed for 5  pev primary protons are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - prot ] together with the standard simulations .",
    "no significant change of the distribution as a whole or the fraction of aligned events is observed for the modified version ( labeled `` @xmath28 '' ) with respect to the original one .",
    "next , the sensitivity of @xmath1 to the transverse momentum @xmath3 of the secondaries is checked .",
    "a connection of high-@xmath3 events and alignment was suggested , e.g. , in  @xcite . in the simulation , the @xmath3 of each secondary produced in a hadronic interaction",
    "is artificially increased by a factor two ( labeled `` @xmath29 '' in fig .",
    "[ fig - prot ] ) , keeping the original angular correlations unchanged .",
    "such an increase is not realistic , but used here to study the sensitivity .",
    "the overall shape of the @xmath1 distribution is affected very little .",

    "distributions for proton showers of 5  pev primary energy without modification of the hadronic particle production ( `` standard version '' ) , with randomly chosen azimuth angles of secondary hadrons ( `` @xmath28 '' ) , and with transverse momenta of secondary hadrons increased by a factor two ( `` @xmath29 '' ) .",
    "simulation points obtained after the modifications are slightly displaced horizontally.,width=302 ]    this insensitivity to modifications of the hadronic particle production suggests that the measured @xmath1 distribution is mostly due to a random distribution of the hadron azimuth angles .",
    "thus , a simplified simulation is performed by artificially generating sets of four hadron positions in the shower plane .",
    "the azimuth angles of the hadrons are chosen randomly with respect to the shower core .",
    "the lateral distances of the hadrons are sampled according to the measured lateral distribution of the four most energetic hadrons .",

    "[ fig - lat ] , even choices of functional forms that are unrealistic for air shower lateral distribution such as adopting a particle density that is constant for any distance from the core , result only in modest changes of the @xmath1 distribution . in general",
    ", a flatter lateral distribution tends to decrease the fraction of aligned events generated in the random sample .",
    "however , the sensitivity of @xmath1 to different lateral shapes is minor .",
    "it seems hardly possible for an air shower experiment to observe differences between @xmath1 distributions that are due to different lateral distributions of the measured particles only .",
    "distributions obtained by a simplified simulation of event topologies ( see text or caption of fig .

    "also , weight factors for the hadrons are introduced to additionally take their reconstructed energy into account .",
    "no significant sensitivity to hadronic particle production properties of these @xmath31-related quantities is found , either .",
    "hadronic shower observables with sensitivity to interaction features have for instance been discussed in  @xcite . a specific , further observable that is based on the four most energetic hadrons in each event as is @xmath1 , is given by the maximum distance , @xmath2 , between one of the four considered hadrons to the geometric centre of the other three  @xcite . since this quantity is intimately connected to the hadron lateral distribution , a sensitivity both to hadronic interaction features such as the transverse momentum of secondary hadrons and to the primary particle type can be expected .",

    "the simulations are hardly able to provide a satisfactory description of the @xmath2 data . for any assumption on the primary composition between proton and iron nuclei , and in particular for a mixed composition",
    "as favoured by other measurements , events with small values of @xmath2 observed in hadronic shower cores are not adequately reproduced by simulations with doubled @xmath3 .",
    "the same conclusion holds when artificially reducing the @xmath3 of secondary hadrons by a factor two ( lower panel in fig .",

    ", the simulations fail to describe the events observed with large values of @xmath2",

    "this is a quite significant result , since in the pamir experiment , compared to kascade , a completely different detection technique is applied , the mass overburden is considerably smaller ( @xmath33  g  @xmath8 ) , and the energy threshold of the registered shower particles is higher by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "a possible interpretation of this concordance is that both @xmath1 distributions are generated mostly from a random distribution .",
