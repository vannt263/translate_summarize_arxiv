    "in this paper we quantify the detectability of 2 in the atmospheres of earth - like planets in orbit around nearby stars .",
    "we investigate 2 in particular because ( a ) it provides a potential indicator for forms of life which produce oxygen ( lger et al . , 1994 ; 1999 )",
    ", ( b ) it produces a strong absorption band at optical wavelengths where high resolution spectroscopy can easily be done using large ground - based telescopes , and ( c ) the individual 2 spectral lines are narrow , and the host star s peculiar velocity is likely to offset many of the extra - solar planetary 2 lines from the telluric ones , enabling detection .",
    "agreement between the observed velocity derived from the planetary 2 lines , and the independently determined host star s peculiar velocity , would confirm the reality of the detection .",
    "low mass stars offer an easier target than larger stars for the detection of planetary transits , since a larger fraction of the stellar flux is blocked as the planet transits .",
    "however , for a planet orbiting in the habitable zone ( hz ) of a low mass star , synchronous rotation may occur by about 4.5 gyr after formation due to tidal damping ( kasting et al .",
    ". however , joshi et al . (",
    "1997 ) have produced detailed models of the atmospheres of terrestrial - type planets around m - stars .",
    "they conclude that , despite the synchronous rotator problem and possible stellar activity , planets orbiting m stars can support atmospheres over a large range of conditions and are very likely to be habitable .",
    "rosenqvist & chassefire ( 1995 ) investigate upper limits for the 2 partial pressure at a planetary surface for primitive abiotic atmosphere , finding an upper limit of @xmath3 mbar , compared to the terrestrial value of @xmath6 mbar . on this basis",
    "they suggest that the detection of large amounts of 2 in the atmosphere of an extra - solar planet would be persuasive evidence for the presence of life .",
    "a simple analytic estimate of the detectability of has been carried out by schneider ( 1994 ) .",
    "he assumed a uniform stellar disk and an 2 density which was constant with atmospheric height .",
    "no fine spectral details were considered since the calculation was based on the total equivalent width of the feature . here",
    "we extend schneider s calculation with a more detailed investigation .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : in section [ sect : terramodel ] , we use ground - based spectra to parameterise the earth s atmospheric 2 absorption . in section [",
    "sect : theory ] we apply that parameterisation to a transiting extra - solar planet . in sections [ sect :",
    "feasib ] to [ sect : discuss ] we give quantitative estimates of the detectability of the for various spectral signal - to - noise ratios and host stellar radii .",
    "we comment on the use of additional spectral features to improve the detection limits beyond those we report here .",
    "finally , we summarise and discuss the simplifications made in our calculation .",
    "to model the terrestrial spectrum , we use high spectral resolution observations of the terrestrial from two high redshift quasar spectra .",
    "the spectra of q0019 - 1522 and q0827 + 5255 were obtained using the keck telescope with the hires spectrograph .",
    "due to incomplete wavelength coverage in the q0019 - 1522 spectrum , and high redshift absorption contamination in the spectrum of q0827 + 5255 , the two spectra were used to provide a complete , high resolution , uncontaminated spectrum .",
    "these spectra are ideal for the purpose , as their intrinsic spectra are otherwise featureless in the wavelength range of the features .",
    "our aim is to explore detection sensitivity for the absorption of an extra - solar earth - like planet as it transits its host star .",
    "one of the variables we explore later is the spectral signal - to - noise ratio of the host star . to generate extra - solar simulations we thus start with a simply - parameterised , noise - free model of the terrestrial absorption .",
    "we obtain this from an empirical fit to the individual absorption lines in the terrestrial a - band . from the observed spectrum , we selected the 28 strongest lines in the spectral range @xmath7 , and fitted voigt profiles to each one individually using vpfit , a non - linear least - squares gauss - newton algorithmrfc / vpfit.html ] .",
    "the fitting procedure provides an initial `` relative column density '' , @xmath8 , for each of the 28 lines . the parameters required to generate one absorption line include column density , intrinsic line width , oscillator strength , absorption coefficient , and laboratory wavelength .",
    "the absolute 2 column density measured on earth looking towards the zenith is n(r ) & = & ^h_0 ( r ) dr + & = & _ ^h_0 e^-r / h dr the 2 number density at the earth s surface is @xmath9 particles m@xmath10 and the 2 scale height is @xmath11  km ( nasa website ) , so for @xmath12 , n _ & = & h _ + & = & 4.1 10 ^ 24  particles  cm^-2 this number applies to each of the 28 lines we fitted . the hitran database ( rothman et al .",
    "1998 ) lists ( with relative line strengths ) a total of 108 features in the spectral range @xmath13 .",
    "we plotted the 28 fitted @xmath8 against the corresponding `` line strength '' parameter from the hitran database and found a very tight linear relationship over 2 orders of magnitude in column density .",
    "this enabled us to compute `` relative column densities '' , @xmath8 , for all 108 lines in the hitran database , including multiply - blended , very weak lines , which would otherwise be difficult to fit .",
    "the tight linear relationship described above shows that the 28 strongest 2 lines correspond well to the linear part of a curve - of - growth , so that for an individual absorption line , the absorption equivalent width , @xmath14 , obeys @xmath15 .",
    "we can therefore produce a `` relative oscillator strength '' , @xmath16 , for each of the 108 lines , _",
    "i = k [ eq : zeta ] where for convenience , the proportionality constant @xmath17 was chosen such that @xmath18 for the strongest 2 line .",
    "we thus end up with a table of 108 values for @xmath16 ( derived as above ) and precise corresponding wavelengths ( from the hitran database ) which can then be used to generate a set of voigt profiles giving a good fit to the entire observed .",
    "the advantage of this method is that we can model the as seen in transmission against an extra - solar planet as it transits its host star using a _ single _",
    "parameter , the geometrically re - scaled 2 column density . the intrinsic line width , which we approximate as being the same for all 2 lines , is derived directly from the terrestrial observations .",
    "a more detailed model would take into account the decreasing intrinsic line width towards increasing wavelength .",
    "the comparison in fig .",
    "1 nevertheless shows that the approximation is acceptable . the synthetic spectrum derived in this way",
    "is illustrated in figure [ fig : synthetic ] .",
    "it gives a good detailed fit to the observations and therefore to the total observed equivalent width across the .",
    "we make a number of simplifications for ease of calculation : ( a ) the planet occults the host star centrally , ( b ) the host star has a featureless spectrum , ( c ) telluric 2 terrestrial absorption is neglected , ( d ) refraction by the extra - solar planetary atmosphere is ignored .",
    "these simplifications are discussed in section [ sect : approximations ] .      here",
    "we deal with the residual starlight which spills around the solid planet and its atmosphere , i.e. the light which is unaffected by either .",
    "the stellar surface brightness decreases with projected radius .",
    "this limb - darkening effect is wavelength dependent ( blue light is more centrally concentrated than red light ) causing a wavelength dependent photometric light curve as the planet transits ( figure [ fig : transit ] ) .",
    "limb darkening also slightly favours the spectroscopic detection of the planet s absorption .",
    "we parameterise the limb darkening effect by i()=i_where @xmath19 is the intensity at the centre of the stellar disk , @xmath20 is a wavelength dependent limb - darkening coefficient .",
    "@xmath21 at the wavelengths ( hestroffer & magnan 1998 ; sacket 1999 ) .",
    "@xmath22 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the direction of the emerging flux , and is given by = where @xmath23 is the stellar radius and @xmath24 is the projected radius from the stellar centre .",
    "the residual starlight is given by f_resid = 2_r_h^r _ i ( ) x dx [ eq : resid1 ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the planet radius and @xmath27 is the maximum planetary atmosphere height ( see figure [ fig : geom ] ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath28 .",
    "equation [ eq : resid1 ] integrates to give f_resid & = & r_^2 - r_h^2 + & & r_^2 - 0.4 r_h^2 [ eq : resid2 ] for @xmath21 , where we have adopted a normalised stellar central intensity of @xmath29 .",
    "figure [ fig : geom ] illustrates the geometry for a transiting planet . the 2 column density along a line of sight grazing the extra - solar planet at an impact parameter @xmath24 is n(x ) & = & 2 f ( r ) dt + & = & 2 f _",

    "the path length along which we wish to integrate , @xmath36 , depends on the height above the surface of the planet , @xmath37 , the impact parameter @xmath24 , and the earth s radius , @xmath38  km ( nasa web site ) , t & = & + dt & = &    the column density at an impact parameter @xmath24 therefore becomes n(x ) = 2 f _",

    "is then given by i_(x ) = i()e^-_(x ) where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the ( relative ) absorption coefficient ( chosen to correspond to the normalisation given in equation [ eq : zeta ] ) .",
    "however , we need to allow for all possible lines of sight through the planetary atmosphere , so must integrate over the sky - projected annulus to obtain the observed spectrum due to starlight passing through the atmosphere , f_atmos = 2_0^h i_(x ) x dx [ eq : atmos ] which may be evaluated numerically .",
    "the flux observed from the host star is given by the sum of equations [ eq : resid2 ] and [ eq : atmos ] f()_obs = f()_atmos + f_resid [ eq : final ] where the @xmath42 dependence is shown to emphasise that , for simplicity , we approximate the underlying stellar light as a flat featureless continuum . the first term on the right hand of equation [ eq : final ] is small and the spectral signature of light transmitted by the planetary atmosphere is massively diluted by the residual starlight .",
    "using the results of section [ sect : theory ] , equation [ eq : final ] enables us to generate synthetic spectra , @xmath43 , which we treat as `` real data '' .",
    "the simulated spectrum is convolved with an instrumental profile assumed to be gaussian with fwhm = 7.7 km / s .",
    "we report the results for 4 stellar radii , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 km ) and 3 signal - to - noise ratios ( per spectral pixel ) of 6000 , 12000 , and 18000 . these signal - to - noise ratios are attainable using existing high resolution echelle spectrographs on 8m - class ground - based telescopes .",
    "integration times of several hours are required , for stellar magnitudes @xmath46 , at the bright end of the m - star luminosity function .",
    "we fit the `` real data '' , with trial models , @xmath47 .",
    "the concentration of 2 in the extra - solar planetary atmosphere , as a fraction of the terrestrial value , @xmath30 , is the only interesting free - parameter , assuming the stellar radius , @xmath23 , is known from independent observations of the star .",
    "we used vpfit to fit the @xmath48 pixels over the spectral range @xmath49 , computing ^2=_i=1^nwhere @xmath50 is the variance per pixel in the `` real data '' . to determine the error bounds on @xmath30",
    ", we use @xmath51 limits , ^2 = ( ^2 - ^2_min ) 9",
    "one of the @xmath52 curves is illustrated in figure [ fig : chisq ] .",
    "the asymmetry of the @xmath53 curve is to be expected , and was similar for all fits .",
    "below @xmath54 , the observed absorption equivalent width is approximately proportional to column density . at higher values of @xmath30 ,",
    "the begins to saturate , and a large increase in @xmath30 then causes little change in the observed intensity .",
    "thus , we are more sensitive to a lower limit than an upper limit .    figure [ fig : results ] illustrates the results for the range in parameter space we explored .",
    "@xmath51 bounds are plotted . only at small @xmath23",
    "can both lower and upper limits be obtained , although lower limits are far more interesting .",
    "it appears feasible to obtain reliable detections of the for combinations of \\{@xmath23 ; s / n } of \\{@xmath55 ; 6000 } , \\{@xmath56 ; 12000 } , and \\{@xmath57 ; 18000}.    our results seem to be less optimistic than those presented in tables 1 and 2 of schneider ( 1994 ) , who suggests that a 3-@xmath58 detection should be possible for an earth - like planet seen against a host m - star , using a 2.4 m telescope with an intergration time of @xmath59 seconds ) .",
    "specifically , the important result we find is that we should be able to detect the transmission absorption feature of the in the atmosphere of an extra - solar planet as it transits a host star with @xmath60 , for s / n @xmath61 .",
    "repeated observations are possible ( to build up spectral signal - to - noise ) for the interesting case of a planet residing in the habitable zone ( hz ) around a low mass host star .",
    "the maximum transit duration is ( sackett 1999 ) , t_t & = & + & = & ( ) ( ) ( ) + & & ( ) ( ) ( ) ( e.g. allen , 1999 ) and we can use kepler s 3rd law p = ( ) ^3/2 ( ) ^1/2  years to get the maximum transit time in hours , t_t 13 ( ) ^1/2 ( ) ^1/2  hours [ eq : transit ]    approximate values of the orbital radii for planets in the habitable zone are @xmath62 0.03 , 0.09 , 0.15 , 0.2 au for stellar masses of 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 @xmath63 ( kasting 1993 ) . using equation [ eq : transit ] , the maximum transit times for planets in these orbits are 0.7 , 1.7 , 2.8 , 3.7 hours .",
    "the corresponding orbital periods are 6 , 22 , 122 , 163 days , so repeated high resolution spectral observations are feasible in order to build up a sufficient spectral signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "life - bearing planets are clearly the most interesting , so we consider the potential number of suitably bright m - stars , with earth - like planets in their hz s , and which are in edge - on orbits so we could detect them .",
    "the number of potential targets is given by the product of the number of available m stars stars down to a given limiting magnitude , @xmath64 , the fration of those stars which have an earth - like planet in the hz , @xmath65 , and the probability of there being an edge - on orbital alignment , i.e. the number of potential targets is [ nlife ]    we assume a potential survey covers the whole - sky .",
    "there are approximately 80 , 380 , 1350 , and 4800 m - stars down to limiting magnitudes of @xmath66 and 13 .",
    "if the observations were carried out using existing echelle spectrographs on current ground - based 8 m optical telescopes , our simulations suggest that an integration time of @xmath3 hours only reaches @xmath67 . a larger telescope aperture or / and better overall telescope / instrumentation efficiency is required to achieve an improvement of , say , of a factor @xmath68 in the photon count - rate , to be able to carry out this experiment using observations of @xmath69 m - stars .",
    "wetherill ( 1996 ) investigates in detail the formation of planets around stars of various mass .",
    "his simulations produce the fascinating result that the probability of forming habitable planets is greatest at a planet - star separation of 1au around a 1@xmath70 star . up to",
    "about 15% of 0.5@xmath70 stars have habitable planets , although these generally have masses smaller than that of the earth .",
    "the results are sensitive to the assumed initial surface density of planetesimals . to increase the planet yield ,",
    "the surface density would need to be more centrally concentrated than that for the solar system . if we assume that a survey could be carried out for @xmath69 m stars , take @xmath71 and @xmath72 , this rough calculation gives a total of 5 m stars , with habitable planets which are in edge - on orbits .",
    "those targets would be pre - selected using photometric transit observations .",
    "a telescope which is considerably greater than 8 m diameter would seem to be required to have a good statistical chance of detecting life elsewhere on an earth - like planet by this technique .",
    "finally , we summarise the simplifications used in the calculations described in this paper , discuss the limitations they lead to , and hence indicate some of the considerations for a real detection .",
    "we did not compute an atmospheric model but instead found a simple way of parameterising the absorption .",
    "our results relate specifically to a transitting planet with the same atmosphere as our earth .",
    "a more sophisticated calculation could be based on computing a model atmosphere and exploring detectability for a range of physical atmospheric parameters .",
    "we did not allow for the telluric .",
    "in practice the extra - solar planet will be shifted with respect to the telluric lines , but only by @xmath73 of the width of the telluric band ( for stellar peculiar velocities of @xmath74 km / s ) .",
    "the telluric and weak extra - solar planet would therefore be confused . at wavelengths",
    "longwards of @xmath75 , there remains a reasonable amount of inter - line continuum against which some fraction of the offset extra - solar planet lines may be measured .",
    "shortwards of @xmath76 , the increased line crowding will make detection harder . note that the actual peculiar velocity of the host star will influence the detectability of the planet , depending on the degree of overlap between the planet and stellar 2 lines .",
    "variability of the telluric lines on time - scales shorter than the time - scale for a single on - target exposure will reduce the detectability .",
    "further observational work is needed to investigate the details of this latter point before the effect can be properly included in an analysis like ours .",
    "we made the approximation that the host star has a featureless spectrum . in practice",
    ", one would obviously have to attempt detection of the extra - solar planet atmosphere against a complex background stellar spectrum . as with the telluric lines , any variability of the stellar spectral features on time - scales less than or comparable to a single on - target exposure will cause problems .",
    "again , further observations are required to quantify this before it can be properly taken into consideration .",
    "our calculation was restricted to the static situation of the planet centrally obscuring the host star . in practice",
    ", the effect of the planet motion will complicate matters in several ways .",
    "for example , there will be a time - dependent asymmetry of the spectral features in the host star spectrum , as the planet obscures different velocities across the stellar surface",
    ". the asymmetry will also be wavelength dependent due to limb - darkening effects .",
    "the orientation of the planetary orbital plane with respect to our line - of - sight would need to be taken into consideration in the analysis of real data .",
    "no attempt was made to include refraction of the stellar light by the atmosphere of the transitting planet .",
    "this may alter the absorption profile shapes .",
    "we assumed voigt profiles .",
    "refraction by the atmosphere of a transitting planet has recently been discussed by hubbard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "our calculations were based only on the band .",
    "the detection sensitivity could be improved by simultaneously including other features such as the o@xmath5 b - band , o@xmath77 , water vapour and methane .",
    "it is possible that detections could be made against larger stellar radii , if additional absorption features are incorporated into the analysis .    in the analysis of real data , considerations such as",
    "those above suggest that detection may best be attempted using differential spectroscopic methods , which would hopefully overcome any short - timescale variability problems .",
    "complex modelling will still be required in order to interpret results .",
    "models will need to be sophisticated compared to the simple calculation we have described in this paper .",
    "however , the results we report at least indicate that in principle it may be possible to detect oxygen in the atmosphere of a transitting extra - solar planet .",
    "we are very grateful to michael ashley , michael box , keith horne , charley lineweaver , gabriel mititelu , michael murphy and jill rathborne for useful comments or discussions .",
