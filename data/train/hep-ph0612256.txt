    "recent rhic experiments @xcite suggest that the quark - gluon plasma may be more like a perfect liquid @xcite , where the mean free path of a particle is much smaller than the inter - particle distance .",
    "values of the mean free path following from _ perturbative _ calculations  @xcite , however , are _",
    "large_. this makes perturbative approaches to the plasma questionable .",
    "lattice simulations of the quark - gluon plasma also need non - perturbative methods for their explanation .",
    "for instance , it has recently been argued  @xcite that non - perturbative chromo- _ electric _ fields can describe the singlet free energy of a static quark - antiquark pair at large distances which remains quite sizeable above the deconfinement temperature @xmath0 .",
    "other lattice data calling for a theoretical explanation are the anomalously large maxima of the internal energy and entropy of the static quark - antiquark pair in unquenched qcd around @xmath0  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . equally surprising is the rapid fall - off of these quantities right after the phase transition .",
    "this paper aims to analyze what kind of nonperturbative physics is necessary to understand these lattice simulations .",
    "we consider three cases : in finite - temperature quenched qcd the @xmath1 system contains many valence gluons  @xcite , which may form a gluon chain .",
    "we demonstrate that the high entropy generated by this object gives a reasonable prediction for the critical behavior of the string tension near @xmath0 . in unquenched qcd for @xmath2 the qcd string may break and the produced light quark and antiquark interact with the heavy @xmath1 pair to form mesons . in unquenched",
    "qcd for @xmath3 the constituents of the quark - gluon plasma interact via screened gluon exchange with the static quark and antiquark .",
    "these three simple models are supposed to catch the main physical aspects of the heavy - quark system in hot qcd .",
    "they can not represent a unified picture due to their inherent approximations . by comparison with the lattice simulations one sees how realistic the so obtained picture is .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we consider quenched su(@xmath4 ) qcd below @xmath0 , calculate the partition function of a gluon chain , and make predictions for @xmath0 and the effective string tension @xmath5 . in section",
    "iii , using @xmath5 , we calculate within the relativistic quark model the partition function of heavy - light mesons and baryons .",
    "the entropy and internal energy stemming from this partition function are compared with the corresponding lattice data . in section",
    "iv , we calculate the interaction energy of quarks , antiquarks and gluons with the heavy quark - antiquark pair immersed in the plasma .",
    "we impose that the plasma particle - number densities vanish at @xmath6 . with this constraint",
    "implemented we calculate the change of the entropy and internal energy in second order perturbation theory due to the quark and antiquark pair .",
    "finally , we estimate contributions coming from possible light @xmath7 octet bound states , which may exist after deconfinement . in section",
    "v , we summarize the main results of the paper .",
    "the @xmath1-string which sweeps out the flat surface of the corresponding wilson loop is produced by soft stochastic gluonic fields .",
    "in addition , fluctuations of the gauge field exist , which lead to string vibrations .",
    "these fluctuations may be related to valence gluons through which the @xmath1-string passes . at asymptotically large @xmath8-separations considered here the string passes through many valence gluons and forms a gluon chain  @xcite .",
    "further , the energy of one string bit between two nearest gluons in the chain is constant .",
    "as long as the thermal mass of a valence gluon is smaller than this energy , gluons move together with the string and do not affect the global dynamics of the string ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "however , at a certain temperature @xmath9 the gluon s thermal mass @xmath10 becomes larger than the energy of one string bit .",
    "from this temperature on , the system looks totally different , since gluons from the string s standpoint are now nearly static .",
    "therefore at @xmath11 a gluon chain becomes a sequence of static nodes with adjoint charges , connected by independently fluctuating string bits ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "at the moment of formation of such a chain , its end - point originating from the heavy @xmath12 performs a _ random walk _ towards @xmath13 over the lattice of static nodes .",
    "the entropy of such a random walk turns out to be large , namely proportional to its length , and eventually leads to the deconfinement phase transition in this model .",
    "the reason for a large entropy is that color may alter from one node of the random walk to another , i.e. every string bit may transport each of the @xmath4 colors .",
    "a similar picture has been proposed by greensite and thorn  @xcite as a time cut of a large wilson loop leading to the above sequence of valence gluons arising from double lines of neighboring plaquettes .",
    "therefore , the total number of states of the gluon chain grows exponentially with its length , @xmath14 , as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the length of one bit of the chain .     where valence gluons move together with the string .",
    "]     where the valence gluons become static , but color may change from one string bit to another . ]    to quantify these considerations , let us begin with considering a free random walk , which is performed over a @xmath17-dimensional euclidean hypercubic lattice ( in our case @xmath18 ) with the spacing @xmath16 . at zero temperature , a walker ,",
    "starting from the origin , arrives at a distance @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a @xmath17-dimensional vector ) with the probability  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the proper time of the walk , i.e. @xmath24 . the probability obviously obeys the conservation law @xmath25 and the initial condition @xmath26 .",
    "this probability is related to the proper - time representation of the green function @xmath27 through @xmath28    let us generalize these formulae to temperatures below the temperature of dimensional reduction .",
    "the probability then depends also on the number @xmath29 of a matsubara mode . in the same way as at zero temperature",
    ", it can be obtained from the proper - time representation of the green function @xmath30 . instead of eq .",
    "( [ zerotemp ] ) , one has ( fixing from now on @xmath18 ) : @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 in @xmath32 runs from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "note that this representation can be obtained directly from  ( [ 1 ] ) upon the decomposition @xmath36 . in the form  ( [ 3 ] ) , the probability obviously obeys the conditions @xmath37 which are similar to those at zero temperature .    in case of a heavy quark - antiquark system ,",
    "the random walk is not free , as `` the walker '' is attached to the heavy quark @xmath12 by the confining string .",
    "the length of the string is @xmath38 , i.e. the number of steps @xmath39 times the step size @xmath16 .",
    "accordingly , eq .  ( [ 3 ] ) becomes replaced by the green function of the confined walker : @xmath40.\\ ] ] here we use eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) with @xmath41 , since the quark and the antiquark at the ends of the string are infinitely heavy .",
    "we will also use the zero - temperature value of the string tension @xmath42 .",
    "the full partition function of the random walk differs from this expression by the above - mentioned entropy factor , @xmath43 , which should be included in the @xmath23-integration .",
    "the expression for the partition function is thus @xmath44.\\ ] ] performing the @xmath23-integration , we obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a macdonald function .",
    "next , to get the static @xmath1-potential , one should as usual take the limit of asymptotically large @xmath1-separations , @xmath47 .",
    "there , the macdonald function falls off exponentially , for which reason the sum can be approximated by its zeroth term alone .",
    "furthermore , since the random walk is suppressed at @xmath48 , its free energy vanishes at @xmath49 , and therefore @xmath50 should be normalized by the condition @xmath51 .",
    "the effective string tension is then defined through the full free energy of the system , which is the sum of the usual linear potential and the normalized free energy of the random walk : @xmath52 an estimate for @xmath0 now follows from the condition that the argument of the first square root vanishes : @xmath53 equating @xmath0 to the modern @xmath54 lattice value  @xcite , 270 mev , we obtain for the effective length of one string bit @xmath55 .",
    "this is larger than the minimal possible value of this quantity , @xmath56  the so - called vacuum correlation length  @xcite , which defines the onset of a string - bit formation . as for the temperature @xmath9 , it can be defined from the condition @xmath57 , which yields @xmath58 an important finding of our model is the behavior @xmath59 the same critical behavior follows from the nambu - goto model for the two - point correlation function of polyakov loops  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the limiting case when string bits can not alter color , i.e. one should _ formally _ set in eq .",
    "( [ st ] ) @xmath60 , that yields @xmath61 the fundamental difference of this limiting case from the realistic one @xmath54 is that here @xmath62 at @xmath63 .",
    "the corresponding value of the critical exponent @xmath64 defines the universality class of the _ two - dimensional _ ising model , which by no means can be realized in four - dimensional quenched su(@xmath4 ) qcd .",
    "the same linear fall - off of @xmath5 with @xmath65 one finds also in the hagedorn phase transition and in the deconfinement scenario based on the condensation of long closed strings  @xcite .",
    "it comes as a mere consequence of the formula @xmath66 with the entropy @xmath67 . for long strings",
    "the entropy is just the logarithm of the number of possibilities to realize on a lattice with the spacing @xmath16 a closed trajectory of length @xmath14 . specifically for a hypercubic lattice ,",
    "the entropy is @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the free energy of such a closed string , @xmath69 , vanishes at @xmath70 .",
    "numerically , in @xmath18 dimensions , @xmath71 , that is by a large factor of 2.6 smaller than the modern lattice value 270  mev .",
    "the principal difference of our calculation is that we consider the random walk _ between two different points _ , taking into account the _ confining force _ between the final and the initial points of the walk along its trajectory .",
    "these are the two facts , which eventually lead to a different critical behavior . in conclusion of this section",
    ", we note that the idea to have a large entropy of the @xmath1-string in the vicinity of @xmath0 due to the valence gluons has recently been mentioned in ref",
    ". however , the possibility that this mechanism leads to deconfinement has not been formulated in that paper .    it should finally be mentioned that , in the string models discussed in the previous paragraph , as well as in the model developed in this paper , the free energy vanishes _ gradually _ at @xmath63 . therefore , none of these models can describe first - order phase transition , which takes place in su(@xmath4 ) quenched qcd at @xmath72 .",
