    "eternal solutions are solutions of mean curvature flow defined on a whole time interval @xmath0 .",
    "since mean curvature flow is quasi - linear parabolic equation , we can not solve the flow backward in time .",
    "hence eternal solutions are very special and have interesting properties if they exist .",
    "translating solutions are solutions of the mean curvature flow which have translation invariance under mean curvature flow , and they are typical examples of eternal solutions .",
    "eternal solutions are type ii singularity models of mean curvature flow , that is , they naturally arise after the parabolic rescaling at type ii singularities . in codimension one",
    ", r. hamilton @xcite showed that any complete convex eternal solution whose curvature attains its maximum at a point in space - time must be a translating solution .",
    "however this fact is still not clear in higher codimension .",
    "therefore , it is natural to consider not only translating solutions , but also eternal solutions to study type ii singularities .    besides above facts , chen - li @xcite and m .-",
    "wang @xcite independently showed that type i singularities do not appear under almost - calibrated ( see section 2 ) lagrangian mean curvature flow .",
    "later neves @xcite generalize this result to the zero - maslov class case . in this case , therefore , we essentially need to investigate type ii singularities and eternal solutions ( including translating solutions ) as the singularity models .",
    "our aim in this paper is to prove a non - existence theorem for eternal solutions of almost - calibrated lagrangian mean curvature flow . in this direction , we know some results by han - sun @xcite , neves - tian @xcite and sun @xcite .",
    "however , all the known results mention only translating solutions . in @xcite , han and",
    "sun showed a non - existence result of almost - calibrated lagrangian translating solitons with nonnegative sectional curvature .",
    "we generalize their theorem @xcite into the class of lagrangian eternal solutions under a similar situation .",
    "[ main ] there is no non - flat complete lagrangian eternal solution with nonnegative ricci curvature to the almost - calibrated lagrangian mean curvature flow in @xmath1 with @xmath2 for each time @xmath3 .    in general ,",
    "the blow - up limit of type ii singularity must be non - flat .",
    "therefore , as a consequence of our result , we obtain the following .    any eternal solution with nonnegative ricci curvature can not arise as blow - up limit of almost - calibrated lagrangian mean curvature flow in @xmath1 .",
    "our result is a parabolic version of theorem by han and sun @xcite , and the proof is somewhat similar to @xcite .",
    "however , to show the parabolic version of the curvature estimate , we adopt another technique by souplet - zhang @xcite and m. wang @xcite to show a parabolic version of curvature estimate .",
    "thanks to the parabolic curvature estimate , we do not need to assume the translation symmetry which is needed in @xcite .",

    "the author has stayed in max planck institute for mathematics in the sciences , leipzig .",
    "the author is grateful to jrgen jost for his hospitality and his interest .",
    "the author also would like to thank reiko miyaoka for her helpful comments .",
    "in the following , our setting follows @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , be the standard complex structure on @xmath6 and the standard symplectic form on @xmath1 .",
    "we consider the closed complex valued @xmath7-form given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 , are complex coordinates of @xmath10 .    a smooth @xmath7-dimensional submanifold @xmath11 in @xmath1 is said to be lagrangian if @xmath12 .",
    "this implies that @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the volume form of @xmath15 and @xmath16 is some multivalued function called _ lagrangian angle _ or _",
    "phase function_. when the lagrangian angle is single valued , the lagrangian is called _ zero - maslov _ class , and if @xmath17 then the lagrangian is said to be _ almost - calibrated_.    we denote by @xmath18 the second fundamental form , and @xmath19 the mean curvature vector of the submanifold @xmath15 in @xmath1 .",
    "now , by the gauss equation , we can write the scalar curvature @xmath20 of @xmath15 as follows : @xmath21 therefore , nonnegative ricci curvature of @xmath15 implies latexmath:[\\ ] ] such a function can be given by a canonical way ( for example , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "we use a cut - off function supported on @xmath116 given by @xmath117 .",
    "let @xmath118 . by using we can calculate @xmath119 note that @xmath116 is compact .",
    "hence @xmath120 attains its maximum at some point @xmath121 in @xmath116 .",
    "we may assume that such a point @xmath122 is not in the cut locus of @xmath71 ( see @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "at the point @xmath123 , we have @xmath124 hence by , we obtain @xmath125 note that the following holds : @xmath126 recall that the following young s inequality :    for any @xmath127 , and any @xmath128 , we have @xmath129 where @xmath130 .    by using , young s inequality and the property of @xmath131 , we can estimate @xmath132 as follows : @xmath133 where @xmath128 is an arbitrary constant which is determined later , @xmath134 are constants depending only on @xmath135 .",
    "similarly , we can calculate by using young s inequality and the property of @xmath131 , @xmath136 since the ricci curvature of @xmath15 is nonnegative , by the laplacian comparison theorem we have @xmath137 using and @xmath138 , we have @xmath139 hence we obtain for the second term of @xmath140 in the same way as above , @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a constant depending only on @xmath135 and @xmath7 .",
    "( note that we may assume @xmath143 for the second inequality since @xmath144 for @xmath145 . )    as for the first term of @xmath140 , we have @xmath146 from , , and , we finally obtain @xmath147 since @xmath128 is arbitrary we can take a sufficiently small @xmath135 such that @xmath148 then we have @xmath149 since @xmath150 on @xmath151 , @xmath152 this completes the proof of theorem [ curvestimate ] .",
    "in the last section , we mention arbitrary codimensional case without proof ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider an isometric immersion @xmath153 , and its mean curvature flow : @xmath154 although mean curvature flow in higher codimension is interesting problem , in general , it becomes rather difficult to deal with since the behavior of the normal bundle is complicated .",
    "few results are known in this field except for special cases ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath155 be a parallel @xmath7-form with @xmath156 .",
    "then @xmath157 induces a function @xmath158 on the immersion @xmath159 by @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the induced volume form on @xmath162 . since @xmath156",
    ", we must have @xmath163 the condition to be a graph then expressed by @xmath164 .",
    "note that there holds @xmath165 is vanish everywhere . in @xcite ,",
    "smoczyk , wang and xin considered mean curvature flow in arbitrary codimension with flat normal bundle , and showed that the flat normal condition is preserved under the mean curvature flow . in this case , we can compute evolution equations similarly to hypersurface cases .",
    "let @xmath167 be an entire graphic eternal solution in arbitrary codimension with flat normal bundle .",
