    "chemical evolution models are fundamental tools to understand the formation and evolution of the milky way ( e.g. matteucci 2001 ) . a good agreement between model predictions and observed properties of the galaxy",
    "is usually obtained by assuming that the disc is well described by concentric annular regions forming by continuous infall of gas without any exchange of matter between them ( e.g. matteucci & franois 1989 ; chiappini et al .",
    "1997 ; franois et al .",
    "2004 , among many others ) .",
    "however , in the presence of gas infall , the galactic disc can not be adequately described by a model with non - interacting zones ( see , e.g. , spitoni & matteucci 2011 , and references therein ) . in particular ,",
    "radial motions of gas should be taken into account when the infalling gas has a specific angular momentum lower than that of the matter moving on circular orbits in the disc , so that mixing with the gas in the disc induces a net radial inflow .",
    "lacey & fall ( 1985 ) estimated that the gas inflow velocity is approximately 1 km s@xmath0 at 10 kpc .",
    "other internal mechanisms , in principle able to induce radial gas flows , may also be present in disc galaxies , as a consequence of asymmetric drift ( smet , posacki & ciotti 2014 ) .",
    "goetz & koeppen ( 1992 ) , portinari & chiosi ( 2000 ) , spitoni & matteucci ( 2011 ) , bilitewski & schnrich ( 2012 ) , spitoni et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , mott et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and cavichia et al .",
    "( 2014 ) present chemical evolution models with the inclusion of radial gas flows .",
    "all these works generally agree on the magnitude and patterns needed for the gas velocities to fit the observational data : the maximum velocity must not exceed a few km s@xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , in all the models cited above the stars are assumed to remain at their birth radii .",
    "the effect of the interaction of the stars with the spiral arms on the stellar orbits is discussed by sellwood & binney ( 2002 ) , who show that : a ) stars on circular orbits experience larger angular momentum changes , and consequently suffer more radial migration , than stars on low - angular momentum orbits ; b ) stars can migrate to large distances within discs , whilst remaining on nearly circular orbits . by studying the specific case of the milky way , sellwood & binney ( 2002 ) found that old stars formed in the solar neighbourhood may have been scattered nearly uniformly within the annular region between 4 and 12 kpc from the galactic centre a scenario confirmed qualitatively by subsequent studies .",
    "for instance , rskar et al . ( 2008 , 2012 ) , using high - resolution n - body simulations coupled with smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , have shown that stars can migrate across large galactocentric distances due to resonant scattering with spiral arms , while remaining on almost circular orbits .",
    "the spiral perturbations redistribute angular momentum within the disc and lead to substantial radial displacements of individual stars , in a manner that largely preserves the circularity of their orbits .",
    "these models are able to explain the observed flatness and spread in the age - metallicity relation of solar neighbourhood stars .",
    "recent work by vera - ciro et al .",
    "( 2014 ) confirm that stellar migration can be driven by sellwood & binney s ( 2002 ) corotation scattering process .",
    "all the above mentioned dynamical models do not consider the effect of the galactic bar ; the role of the bar for radial migration is thoroughly analysed in minchev & famaey ( 2010 ) and minchev et al .",
    "these authors suggest that radial migration results from the nonlinear coupling between the bar and the spiral waves and predict a variation of the efficiency of migration with time and galactocentric radius . in a more recent study , halle et al .",
    "( 2015 ) confirm that strong radial migration has to be expected in the case of a bar - spiral resonance overlap , but also suggest that the galactic outer lindblad resonance acts as a barrier : stars do not migrate from the inner to the outer disc , and vice versa .",
    "although the existence of the phenomenon of radial migration seems to be established beyond any doubt , _ a quantitative estimate of its impact on the chemical evolution of the galactic disc is much more difficult_. besides the above - mentioned work of halle et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , that challenges any scenario in which significant fractions of stars move from the inner to the outer disc , and vice versa , some concerns about the effective role of the bar in stellar migration have been raised by snchez - blzquez et al .",
    "these authors present a comparative study of the stellar metallicity gradients and age distributions in a sample of nearly face - on spiral galaxies , with and without bars .",
    "the process of radial migration should flatten the stellar metallicity gradient with time and , therefore , flatter stellar metallicity gradients should be expected in barred galaxies .",
    "however , snchez - blzquez and collaborators do not find any difference in the metallicity nor in the age gradients of galaxies with or without bars .    the first attempt to analyse the impact that stellar migration could have on the chemical properties of the milky way disc was done by franois & matteucci ( 1993 ) . by discussing the spread observed in the age - metallicity relation and in the [ @xmath1/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] relations for solar neighbourhood stars",
    ", these authors concluded that most of the observed spread can be accounted for by the fact that some of the stars we observe at the present time in the solar vicinity might have been born in different regions of the galactic disc , in particular in more inner ones .",
    "their paper was based on observational features of a possible radial migration presented in pioneering works by grenon ( 1972 , 1989 ) .",
    "grenon identified an old population of super metal - rich stars , that are currently located in the solar vicinity , but have kinematics and abundance properties indicative of an origin in the inner galactic disc .",
    "despite the recent advances in the field of galaxy formation and evolution , there are currently no self - consistent simulations containing the level of chemical implementation required for making detailed predictions for the number of ongoing and planned milky way observational campaigns . even in high - resolution n - body experiments , one particle represents @xmath2 solar masses .",
    "hence , a number of approximations are necessary to compute the chemical enrichment self - consistently inside a dynamical simulation .",
    "schnrich & binney ( 2009a , b ) included in a chemical model the radial migration of stars and gas through the disc of the galaxy by means of a probabilistic approach constrained by milky way observables and found results in agreement with rskar et al . ( 2008 ) .",
    "they found also that most observational properties and peculiarities of the thick disc could be explained by radial migration .",
    "recently , minchev et al . ( 2013 , 2014 ) have presented a new approach for combining chemistry and dynamics that overcomes the technical problems originated by fully self - consistent simulations , and avoids the star formation and chemical enrichment problems encountered in previous simulations .",
    "they assume that each particle is one star and implement the star formation history and chemical enrichment deriving from a classic chemical evolution model for the thin disc into the simulated galactic disc .",
    "kubryk et al .",
    "( 2013 , 2014 ) also studied radial migration and chemical evolution for a general bar - dominated disc galaxy , by analysing the results of a fully self - consistent , high - resolution n - body+sph simulation .",
    "stars undergo substantial radial migration at all times , caused first by transient spiral arms and later by the bar .",
    "the authors stress that , despite the important amount of radial migration occurring in their model , its impact on the chemical properties is limited .    here",
    ", we adopt a phenomenological approach to study the effects of different prescriptions for the stellar migration on the best known chemical evolution observables . in practice , we implement stellar migration in a very simple way in a detailed chemical evolution model for the galactic thin disc that already includes radial gas flows .",
    "we first focus on the metallicity distribution function of long - lived stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "we then examine the effects of the migration on other observables , such as the age - metallicity relation of stars in the solar vicinity and the stellar density profile across the disc .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  2 we describe our reference chemical evolution model and the way in which the radial gas flows and the stellar migration have been implemented . in section  3",
    "we report the model results without stellar migration , whereas model results with stellar migration are presented in section  4 .",
    "finally , we draw our main conclusions in section  5 .",

    "our reference model for the galactic thin disc is that presented in spitoni & matteucci ( 2011 ) .",
    "the model assumes that the disc grows via smooth accretion of gas of primordial chemical composition .",
    "the infall law is : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , the @xmath5-folding timescale , is a free parameter of the model and the coefficient @xmath6 is set by the requirement that the current total mass surface density profile of the galactic thin disc is reproduced . in order to mimic an inside - out formation of the disc ( larson 1976 ) ,",
    "the timescale for mass accretion is assumed to increase with the galactic radius following a linear relation ( see chiappini et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) : @xmath7 this relation holds for galactocentric distances between 4 and 16  kpc .",
    "the region within 4  kpc is not considered in this paper .",
    "the infall law adopted in this work is clearly a rough approximation of the true mass assembly history of the disc , still necessary since we do not rely on a full cosmological setting . however , it has been shown ( colavitti et al .",
    "2008 ) that the results of a model assuming such an exponentially - decaying infall law are fully compatible with those obtained with cosmological accretion laws .    as for the imf",
    ", we use that of scalo ( 1986 ) , constant in time and space .",
    "we indicate with @xmath8 the evolutionary lifetime of the stars with initial mass _ m _ ( maeder & meynet 1989 ) . the type ia supernova ( sn ) rate is computed following greggio & renzini ( 1983 ) and matteucci & greggio ( 1986 ) .",
    "the stellar yields are taken from woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) for core - collapse sne , van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) for low- and intermediate - mass stars , and iwamoto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for type ia sne .",
    "we use a star formation ( sf ) rate proportional to the gas surface density :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the efficiency of the sf process and @xmath11 is the gas surface density at a given position and time .",
    "the exponent @xmath12 is fixed to 1.4 ( see kennicutt 1998 ) .    motivated by the theory of sf induced by spiral density waves in galactic discs ( wyse & silk 1989 )",
    ", we consider a variable star formation efficiency ( sfe ) as a function of the galactocentric distance , @xmath13 ( model ref1 , table  1 ) .",
    "this is different from spitoni & matteucci ( 2011 ) , who use a constant value for the sfe ( model ref2 , table  1 ) .",
    "the reason for this choice is related to the fact that with a constant sfe the predicted abundance ratio patterns ( e.g. [ o / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] ) do not change much from radius to radius , thus making the hypothesis of stellar migration as a solution for the observed spread rather unlikely .",
    "figure  [ eff ] shows the sfe as a function of the galactocentric distance used in this work .",
    "it is worth emphasising that a larger sfe in the inner disc is assumed also by kubryk et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and , probably , by minchev et al .",
    "( 2013 ) ; in the latter paper the authors do not state it explicitly , but an inspection of their results leads us to believe that this is the case .",
    "it is the combination of radial migration with a variable sfe across the disc that allows to reproduce the observed abundance spreads .      in our reference model",
    "a constant radial inflow of gas with velocity of -1 km s@xmath0 is implemented following the prescriptions of spitoni & matteucci ( 2011 ) .",
    "we define the @xmath12-th shell in terms of the galactocentric radius @xmath14 , its inner and outer edge being labeled as @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we take the inner edge of the @xmath12-shell , @xmath15 , at the midpoint between the characteristic radii of the shells @xmath12 and @xmath17 , and similarly for the outer edge @xmath16 .",
    "the flow velocities @xmath18 are assumed to be positive outward and negative inward .",
    "radial inflows with a flux @xmath19 contribute to alter the gas surface density @xmath20 in the @xmath12-th shell according to @xmath21_{rf } =      - \\frac { f(r_{k+\\frac{1}{2 } } ) - f(r_{k-\\frac{1}{2 } } ) } { \\pi \\left ( r^2_{k+\\frac{1}{2 } } - r^2_{k-\\frac{1}{2 } } \\right ) }    , \\ ] ] where the gas flow at @xmath16 can be written as    @xmath22    we assume that there are no flows from the outer parts of the disc where there is no sf",
    ". in our implementation of the radial inflow of gas , only the gas in the galactic disc at @xmath23 20 kpc can move inward by radial inflow .      as discussed in the introduction",
    ", we implement stellar migration in our chemical evolution code using a phenomenological approach , without a specific description of the complex dynamical mechanisms affecting stellar orbits in galactic discs . in practice , we simply move stars formed at a given radius , with a certain age and a certain metal content , to the solar vicinity , according to some simple rule . following the work of kordopatis et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , we assume as a representative value for the velocity of the stars 1 km s@xmath0 , that is @xmath24 1  kpc gyr@xmath0 . to explore the velocity parameter space",
    "we also run models with stellar velocities fixed to 0.5 and 2 km s@xmath0 .",
    "we stress that by taking into account a velocity of 1  km s@xmath0 , only stars with stellar lifetimes @xmath25  1  gyr , corresponding to initial masses @xmath26  2  m@xmath27 ( see figure  3 of romano et al .",
    "2005 , and references therein ) , can travel for distances larger than 1  kpc .",
    "we can thus safely assume that most of the metals produced by a stellar generation are ejected well within 1  kpc from their progenitors birthplace .",
    "therefore , the metal enrichment of the ism in the solar vicinity is practically unaffected by the stars born in the inner regions , that are thus only ` passive tracers ' of the process of migration .",
    "we notice that , as estimated by lacey & fall ( 1985 ) with simple calculations , the magnitude of the radial gas flows velocity is roughly 1 km s@xmath0 at 10 kpc .",
    "hence , stellar migration and radial gas inflows are characterised by the same time scales , and this is the reason why one has to consider both processes for a complete and consistent study .",
    "first , we want to test the effect of assuming a physically plausible stellar migration on our chemical evolution model predictions .",
    "to this aim , we use the results of chemo - dynamical simulations by minchev et al .",
    "( 2013 ) to obtain general recipes to be used in our pure chemical evolution code .",
    "we choose this study since the chemical evolution model adopted by the authors is very similar to ours , which allows a test of the validity of our approach .",
    "indeed , as we will show in section 4 , if we assume that 10% and 20% of the stars born at 4 and 6 kpc , respectively , migrate towards 8 kpc , while 60% of those born at 8 kpc leave the solar neighbourhood ( percentages are drawn from minchev et al.s dynamical simulations ) , the metallicity distribution function we predict for long - lived solar vicinity stars turns out to be very similar to that obtained by minchev and collaborators .",
    "then , we also test some extreme cases , that are not supported by dynamical studies , with the aim of exploring the effects that a huge migration of stars would have on the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood ( see section  4 ) .",
    "vs [ fe / h ] relations ( lines ) predicted by our models ref1 _ ( upper panel ) _ and ref2 _ ( lower panel ) _ at different galactocentric distances , as indicated in the bottom left legend in the top panel .",
    "the two models include radial gas flows and differ only in the assumed sfe ( see text ) .",

    "[ cem ] , the principal characteristics of the models are reported : the time scale of thin - disc formation , @xmath4 , is listed in column 2 ; the adopted sfes in column 3 ; the velocity of the radial gas inflow in column 4 . for the model including stellar migration ( ` minchev case ' model ) , columns 5 and 6 specify the adopted prescriptions about the fraction of migrating stars and their velocities .",
    "in figure [ evol ] it is shown that model ref1 ( red curve , labelled 13 gyr ) perfectly fits the present - day oxygen abundance gradient measured in cepheids .",
    "the data ( from luck & lambert 2011 ) have been divided into bins 1-kpc wide ; for each bin we compute the average value and the relative standard deviation . in figure [ evol ]",
    "we also show the evolution of the gradient , computed at 4 , 6 , 8 and 13 gyr .",
    "it is worth noting that the combination of a variable sfe with higher values in the inner disc regions with a constant radial gas flow leads to a steepening of the gradient in time .    in the upper panel of figure [ ofe_ref ]",
    "we show the [ o / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] relations obtained with model  ref1 at different galactocentric distances , spanning the range between 4 and 16  kpc .",
    "the theoretical predictions are very similar to the ones reported by minchev et al .",
    "( 2013 ; see their figure  4 , bottom left panel ) and are mainly driven by the adoption of a sfe that varies with the galactocentric distance in the model . for reference ,",

    "( 2005 ) . in the lower panel of figure [ ofe_ref ]",
    "we show the effects of assuming a constant sfe ( model ref2 ) on the [ o / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] diagram .",
    "it is immediately seen that the observed spread in the data can not be longer reproduced by the chemical evolution model .",
    "we conclude that the hypothesis of stellar migration as a solution for the observed spread requires necessarily a variable sfe .",
    "this is even more evident from figure [ fe_t ] , where we show the age - metallicity relation predicted by model  ref1 for different galactocentric distances , compared to the data for thin - disc stars in the solar vicinity from bensby et al .",
    "other authors already claimed ( e.g. franois & matteucci 1993 ; schnrich & binney 2009a ) that the observed spread in the data can be explained with the migration of stars both from the inner and the outer regions , and we confirm their findings . also , we remark that , while the migration produces a spread of up to 1 dex in [ fe / h ] at a given age , a much lower spread is expected in the [ o / fe ] ratios at a given metallicity ( cfr . figures .",

    "( 2013 ) , comprising stars with galactocentric distances between 7.9 and 8.1 kpc and with heights above the galactic plane @xmath28 smaller than 0.1 kpc , is not a pure thin - disc sample .",

    "the distributions of adibekyan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and fuhrmann ( 2011 ) , while agreeing on the position of the peak , significantly differ in shape .",
    "this could be due to sample selection effects : while fuhrmann s survey is limited to objects with _",

    "( 2013 ) rely on high - resolution analysis of a kinematically unbiased sample of more than 1000 fgk stars located up to 600  pc but mostly within 50  pc from the sun .",
    "interestingly , the apogee distribution , extending to significantly larger distances and sampling nearly 10 times more stars , compares well to that from adibekyan et al .",
    "( 2013 ; see anders et al .",
    "therefore , in the following we will use the adibekyan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) distribution for comparison with the model predictions .",

    "we see that the metallicity distribution function of adibekyan et al .",

    "we are considering velocities fixed at 1 km s@xmath0 @xmath36 1 kpc gyr@xmath0 and , thus , the curve relative to the stars coming from 4 kpc ends at 10 gyr : all stars born at 4 kpc at times larger than 10 gyr from the beginning of the simulation do not have enough time to reach the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the same explanation is valid for the 6 kpc line result , i.e. for times larger than 12 gyr no stars formed at 6  kpc can reach the solar neighbourhood .     vs time in the solar neighbourhood for the ` minchev case ' model , where a velocity of 1 km s@xmath0 is considered for the migrating stars .",

    "each distribution is normalised to the total number ( young+intermediate+old ) of stars . ]        in figure  [ age ] we show the metallicity distributions of long - lived stars in the solar vicinity predicted by our models with ( dashed lines ; ` minchev case ' model , velocity of the migrating stars set to 1 km s@xmath0 ) and without stellar migration ( solid lines ; model  ref1 ) .",
    "the total distributions ( cyan lines ) are split in different age bins : we consider young stars ( ages @xmath37 1 gyr ; blue lines ) , intermediate - age stars ( 1 gyr @xmath37 ages @xmath37 5 gyr ; black lines ) and old stars ( ages @xmath38 5 gyr ; red lines ) .",

    "the finite velocity of the stars is taken into account in order to establish how many inner - disc stars end up in the solar neighbourhood .    in our reference model without stellar migration ( model  ref1 , with variable sfe and radial gas inflow included with a velocity of 1 km s@xmath0 ) , 3.30% of the stars present ages less than 1 gyr , 23.74% have ages between 1 and 5 gyr , whereas the oldest stars with ages larger than 5 gyr are 72.96% of the total .",
    "concerning the model with stellar migration ( ` minchev case ' model ) , 1.25% of the stars have ages less than 1 gyr , 15.93% have ages between 1 and 5 gyr , and the oldest stars with ages larger than 5 gyr are 82.82% .",
    "different prescriptions for the stellar velocities would increase ( smaller velocities ) or decrease ( larger velocities ) the contribution of the old stars to the g - dwarf metallicity distribution function .",
    "the main effect of the stellar migration , in the way in which it is implemented here , is to increase the percentage of old stars in the solar neighbourhood compared to the model without stellar migration .    finally , we test the effects on the metallicity distribution of long - lived stars in the solar neighbourhood of ` extreme ' stellar migrations , where we do not allow stars born in situ at 8 kpc to migrate toward other regions .",
    "we distinguish 3 cases :    * case 1 ) : 10% of the stars born at 4 kpc and 20 % of those born at 6 kpc migrate towards 8 kpc ; * case 2 ) : 20% of the stars born at 4 kpc and 40 % of those born at 6 kpc migrate towards 8 kpc ; * case 3 ) : all the stars born at 4 and 6 kpc migrate towards 8 kpc .",
    "we show ( figure [ ex_gd ] ) that the main effect of stellar migration in all these extreme cases ( even in the really extreme and unphysical case 3 ) is to populate the high - metallicity tail of the predicted distribution .",
    "overall , the predicted stellar metallicity distribution is not substantially affected .",
    "in particular , the position of the peak is left unchanged : it mostly depends on the assumed timescale of thin - disc formation .",
    "we conclude that the g - dwarf metallicity distribution can not be used to extract information on the extent and significance of stellar migration .",
    "however , this process is clearly needed in order to improve the agreement between model predictions and observations on the high - metallicity tail .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effects of the stellar migration by means of a detailed chemical evolution model where radial gas flows in the galactic disc are also considered .",
    "the stellar migration is implemented in the code in a phenomenological way , just mimicking the results of published dynamical models , with no intention of studying the physics of this phenomenon .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * our reference chemical evolution model for the thin disc of the milky way , assuming a variable star formation efficiency , a constant radial gas inflow ( fixed at -1 km s@xmath0 ) and no stellar migration , is able to well fit the majority of the observables : the abundance gradient along the galactic disc , the stellar mass surface density profile ; also the observed g - dwarf metallicity distribution of thin - disc stars ( adibekyan et al . 2013 ) is generally in agreement with our model , the only problem residing in the high - metallicity tail of the distribution , which our model is underestimating . * by including stellar migration according to simple prescriptions that mimic the results of chemo - dynamical models by minchev et .",
