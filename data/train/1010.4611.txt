    "this labeling of the leaves corresponds to the lexicographical order of the points of the configuration . in a word , given two points @xmath263 and @xmath264 in a configuration , the closest common ancestor of the leaves labeled @xmath265 and @xmath266 represents the largest coordinate in which the two points coincide . with this sorting algorithm in mind",

    "there is a natural correspondence between the coordinates of @xmath268 and the vertices of @xmath36 minus the root . for each element",
    "@xmath269 we think of an assignment of a real number to each vertex of the tree .",

    "we describe the configuration @xmath271 .",
    "the @xmath130-th coordinate of the @xmath46-th point of the configuration is the coordinate of @xmath153 assigned to the unique vertex of level @xmath130 on the path from the root to the leaf  i. this process describes an element of @xmath272 corresponding to an element of @xmath268 , for @xmath249 to be the image , redefine this assignment to map all the elements that got mapped to @xmath273 to the point at infinity . is easy to check that we have defined a cell decomposition .",

    "the cells generating @xmath293 correspond to trees with one vertex of each rank from @xmath250 to @xmath294 , two vertices of rank @xmath15 and @xmath4 vertices of rank @xmath4 . correspondingly these are configurations lying on the same @xmath262-plane with the points of the configuration divided into two groups , each group lying on a line , so @xmath295 has @xmath296 generators , one for each nontrivial integer solution of @xmath297 .",

    "since @xmath302 , understanding the @xmath274-homology group boils down to understanding @xmath303 , here the choice of coefficients will be crucial .",
    "now we exhibit a section @xmath304 of this bundle that is transversal to the zero section and such that the pull back of the zero section by @xmath304 is the cell @xmath290 .",
