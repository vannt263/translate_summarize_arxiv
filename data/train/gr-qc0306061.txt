    "only few years after introducing the field equations of general relativity , albert einstein includes in the field equations the cosmological constant . moreover , in the light of the experimental evidence of the expansion of the universe , himself considered the inclusion of the cosmological constant `` ... the biggest blunder of my life.''@xcite .",
    "recently , the experiments that use supernova as standard candles , realized independently by two groups @xcite , @xcite indicates that our universe is accelerated .",
    "the increase of the expansion velocity of the universe can be explained by a repulsive force that appears in the energy momentum tensor as a negative pressure . this negative pressure can be supply by the cosmological constant or term , time dependent .    before the supernova indications that our universe is accelerated , l. krauss and m. turner @xcite call our attention that `` the cosmological constant is back '' .",
    "they cited the age of the universe , the formation of large - scale structure and the matter content of the universe as the data that cry out by a cosmological constant .",
    "in the another hand , the inclusion of the cosmological constant creates new problems .",
    "some of them are old , as the problem about the discrepancy among the observed value for the energy density for the vacuum , and the large value suggested by the particle physics models @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this small value for the cosmological constant today can be justify if we admit a cosmological term ( @xmath1 ) , dependent of time , in the place of the cosmological constant .",
    "the @xmath1 term represents a type of dark non barionic matter that differs from the usual because it is not gravitationally clustered at all scales .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath1 term results in a cosmological scenario with a good agreement in respect to the estimative for the age of the universe , the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation , and the supernova experiments @xcite , @xcite .    in another hand , models that includes particle production in the cosmological scenario also produce compatible results in respect to the experimental evidence resulting in a relative attention to this model in the literature",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in this work , we study models with a dissipative pressure due to decaying of a cosmological term and particle production .",
    "the dissipative pressure is related to the decaying of @xmath1 and to particle production using the adiabatic criterious , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is the entropy and @xmath5 is the particle density .",
    "the adiabatic condition is necessary for to maintain the compatibility with the constraints of the cosmic microwave background radiation when the creation of photons are considered @xcite .",
    "taking into account the time derivative of the energy conservation equation @xmath6 and the euler equation that defines the chemical potential @xmath7 @xmath8 we obtain @xmath9    constructing the entropy four - vector @xmath10 , we can express the second law of thermodynamics in a covariant way @xmath11 where we use the continuity equation @xmath12 the @xmath13 denotes the source of particles and @xmath14 is the expansion ( @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the scale factor ) .",
    "the energy momentum - tensor is described by a perfect fluid with a term that can be consider as the energy of the vacuum , namely @xmath17 the @xmath18 is the total pressure that includes the usual thermodynamic pressure ( @xmath19 ) and a dissipative pressure ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 is the matter - energy density and @xmath22 is the quadri - velocity vector . for this energy - momentum tensor",
    "the expression for the energy conservation , @xmath23 , results @xmath24 using expressions ( 3 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) we obtain for the entropy relation , equation ( 4 ) , the expression @xmath25 taking into account the decay of @xmath0 and the particle production as an adiabatic process ( @xmath2 ) , consequently @xmath26      we consider the space - time described by the metric @xmath27 the field equations for the space time described above and the energy momentum tensor ( 6 ) are @xmath28 eliminating @xmath21 from the field equations ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) and using the expression ( 9 ) for the dissipative pressure , we obtain @xmath29 = \\frac{\\dot \\lambda}{\\theta } + \\lambda(1+\\nu)(1-\\frac{\\psi}{n\\theta})\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath30 is a constant given by the state equation @xmath31 .",
    "the particle production is due to decaying of @xmath0 .",
    "so , we consider that the contribution of the @xmath0 term and particle production to the dissipative pressure , are proportional .",
    "namely , @xmath32 @xmath33 is a constant .",
    "note that , @xmath34 implies in the entropy of the universe and @xmath0 constants .    using equation ( 9 ) ( 14 ) the dissipative pressure is given by @xmath35 carvalho and lima @xcite call the attention that the `` ansatz '' used by chu and wu @xcite do not fix @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , it is possible a different decaying law for @xmath0 . assuming @xmath37^n $ ] , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are respectively the planck length and time , the hubble time where n is a integer . to get rid the constant of planck dependence of @xmath0 we must have @xmath41 @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "the hubble time is proportional to @xmath42 , then we can consider the scaling of @xmath1 as @xmath43 taking into account relations ( 7 ) , ( 9 ) and ( 12 ) we find @xmath44 substituting ( 16 ) into ( 17 ) , we find the particle source corresponding to the @xmath1 term , namely @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a constant .",
    "this source of particle production has appear in the literature , where the constant @xmath47 is described by a phenomenological constant @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in our case",
    "this constant is given by @xmath48 .",
    "the differential equation that rules the model can be obtained substituting ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) into the equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) , resulting in the field equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "integration of this equation results @xmath51 this solution is not valid for @xmath52 that implies @xmath53 , but if we put @xmath54 into equation ( 13 ) we obtain the model with @xmath1 constant .",
    "considering @xmath55 in equation ( 13 ) we recover the open system cosmological model @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this work we consider the entropy per particle constant ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "using expressions ( 4 ) , ( 8) and taking into account that the @xmath0 term decays , we obtain @xmath57 to consider @xmath58 is plausible since we expected that @xmath0 have a greater value in the past .",
    "however , for do not violate the second law of thermodynamics we must have particle creation and not particle destruction .      according recent observations from the supernova type ia , the expansion velocity of the universe increases .",
    "generally an negative pressure is responsible for the acceleration of the universe . in this work",
    "the dissipative pressure @xmath20 is the responsible for this . looking the expressions ( 9 ) and ( 14 ) we note that @xmath59 since that , the @xmath1 term decays . in another hand , the deacceleration parameter ( @xmath60 ) is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "so , to obtain an accelerated universe we must satisfy @xmath63 the profile of the deacceleration parameter ( 23 ) is given by :     and @xmath64.,width=226 ]      the high z supernova team estimates for the age of the universe @xmath65 gyrs @xcite and @xmath66 gyrs @xcite .",
    "carreta et al .",
    "@xcite using results from hipparcos , rrlyrae and chepheids to re - calibrate the globular clusters distance scale , found @xmath67 gyrs .",
    "butcher @xcite used the abundance of the @xmath68 as a method for estimate the age of the stars and consequently a lower limit for the age of the universe . using the relation among the abundance of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , westin et al .",
    "@xcite find about @xmath71 gyrs , while johnson and bolte @xcite found about @xmath72 gyrs .",
    "recently , krauss and chaboyer @xcite estimates a level lower limit on the age of the universe , @xmath73 gyrs with @xmath74 confidence .    in view of the above results we must to consider the possibility that we can not live in a flat matter dominated universe , since the universe in this scenario is younger than the experimental evidence indicates .    using the scale factor ( 20 )",
    ", we find for the age of the universe the expression @xmath75 \\ , .\\ ] ] to obtain a universe older than the standard model is necessary that @xmath76    the evolution for condition ( 26 ) have the following profile .     e @xmath64,width=226 ]    considering the interval of validity for @xmath64 , the conditions ( 26 ) and ( 24 ) , and the fact that we have particle creation ( @xmath77 ) , we can infer a validity range for @xmath78 , namely @xmath79 .",
    "we consider a model with particle production at the expenses of decay of a cosmological term and obtain an exact solution for the field equations . considering , the second law of thermodynamics , the dissipative pressure ( 15 ) and in the results from supernova type ia , which indicates that we live in an accelerating universe , we obtain an interval for the constant @xmath64 that gives the contribution of @xmath1 term to the dissipative pressure .",
    "namely @xmath80 .",
    "the indications that we live in a universe older then the stablished by the standard model results in a validity range for @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "looking to the profiles , figure ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , in the validity intervals for @xmath64 and @xmath81 the universe is accelerated and older than the estimatives from the standard model .",
    "the next step for a future work is analyze the lensing probability for this model , luminosity distance diagram and the influence of this background in the diameter distance of distant objects . generally , the accelerated models for the universe presents the growing modes for the density contrast evolving more slower than the modes obtained for the standard model .",
    "this topic is also motive for future study ."
