    "+ + + + + + + + + + +    the main motivation behind the present work is to understand metastability of _ multi - type particle systems _ subject to _ conservative stochastic dynamics_. in the past ten years , a good understanding has been achieved of the metastable behavior of the lattice gas subject to kawasaki dynamics , i.e. , a conservative dynamics characterized by random hopping of particles of a single type with hardcore repulsion and nearest - neighbor attraction .",
    "the analysis was based on a combination of techniques from large deviation theory , potential theory , geometry and combinatorics . in particular , a precise description has been obtained of the time to nucleation ( from the `` gas phase '' to the `` liquid phase '' ) , the shape of the critical droplet triggering the nucleation , and the typical nucleation path , i.e. , the typical growing and shrinking of droplets . for an overview",
    "we refer the reader to two recent papers presented at the 12th brazilian school of probability : gaudillire and scoppola  @xcite and gaudillire  @xcite . for an overview on metastability and droplet growth in a broader context ,",
    "we refer the reader to the monograph by olivieri and vares  @xcite , and the review papers by bovier  @xcite , @xcite , den hollander  @xcite , olivieri and scoppola  @xcite .",
    "the model we study constitutes a first attempt to generalize the results in bovier , den hollander and nardi  @xcite for two - dimensional kawasaki dynamics with one type of particle to _ multi - type particle systems_. we take a large finite box @xmath0 .",
    "particles come in two types : type @xmath1 and type @xmath2 .",
    "particles hop around subject to hard - core repulsion , and are conserved inside @xmath3 . at the boundary of @xmath3 particles are created and annihilated as in a gas reservoir , where the two types of particles have different densities @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we assume a binding energy @xmath6 between particles of different type , and no binding energy between particles of the same type . because of the `` antiferromagnetic '' nature of the interaction , configurations with minimal energy have a `` checkerboard '' structure .",
    "the phase diagram of this simple model is already very rich .",
    "the model can be seen as a conservative analogue of the blume - capel model investigated by cirillo and olivieri  @xcite .",
    "our model describes the condensation of a low - temperature and low - density supersaturated lattice gas .",
    "we are interested in studying the nucleation towards the liquid phase represented by the checkerboard configuration @xmath7 , starting from the gas phase represented by the empty configuration @xmath8 .",
    "it turns out that the _ geometry _ of the energy landscape is much more complex than for the model of kawasaki dynamics with one type of particle .",
    "consequently , it is a somewhat delicate matter to capture the proper mechanisms behind the growing and shrinking of droplets .",
    "our proofs use potential theory and rely on ideas developed in bovier , den hollander and nardi  @xcite for kawasaki dynamics with one type of particle .",
    "[ [ two - previous - papers . ] ] two previous papers .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in @xmath9 we identified the values of the parameters for which the model properly describes the condensation of a supersaturated gas and exhibits a metastable behavior . under _",
    "three hypotheses _ , we determined the distribution and the expectation of the nucleation time , and identified the so - called critical configurations that satisfy a certain `` gate property '' .",
    "the first hypothesis assumes that configuration @xmath7 , corresponding to the liquid phase , is a minimizer of the hamiltonian .",
    "the second hypothesis requires that the valleys of the energy landscape are not too deep .",
    "the third hypothesis requires that the critical configurations have an appropriate geometry .",
    "subject to the three hypotheses , several theorems were derived , for which _ three model - dependent quantities _ needed to be identified as well : ( 1 ) the energy barrier @xmath10 separating @xmath8 from @xmath7 ; ( 2 ) the set @xmath11 of critical configurations ; ( 3 ) the cardinality @xmath12 of the set of protocritical configurations , which can be thought of as the `` entrance '' set of @xmath11 .",
    "quantity ( 1 ) was identified in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we identify quantities ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .    in @xcite",
    "the first two hypotheses were verified and the energy value @xmath10 of the energy barrier separating @xmath8 and @xmath7 is identified .",
    "these results were sufficient to establish the exponential probability distribution of the nucleation time divided by its mean , and to determine the mean nucleation time up to a multiplicative factor @xmath13 of order @xmath14 as the inverse temperature @xmath15 .",
    "[ [ present - paper . ] ] present paper .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in the present paper we show that the model satisfies the third hypothesis , and we identify the set of critical configurations .",
    "we give a geometric characterization of the configurations in @xmath11 and compute the value of @xmath12 .",
    "a prototype of the critical configuration was already identified in @xcite , and consists of a configuration of minimal energy with @xmath16 particles of type @xmath17 arranged in a cluster of minimal energy plus a particle of type @xmath17 .",
    "the difficult task is to characterize the _ full _ set of critical configurations .",
    "this part of the analysis uses the specific dynamical features of the model , which are investigated in detail in a neighborhood of the saddle configurations .",
    "this task is carried over by observing that , in the regime @xmath18 and in configurations of minimal energy , each particle of type @xmath17 is surrounded by particles of type @xmath19 .",
    "this allows us to look at configurations of minimal energy not as clusters of single particles , but as clusters of `` tiles '' : particles of type @xmath17 surrounded by particles of type @xmath19 the tiles making up the cluster can travel around the cluster faster than particles of type @xmath17 can appear at the boundary of @xmath3 .",
    "this motion of tiles along the border gives the dynamics the opportunity to extend the set of critical configurations .",
    "different mechanisms are identified that allow tiles to travel around a cluster .",
    "the energy barrier that must be overcome in order to activate these mechanisms is determined , and is compared with the energy barrier the dynamics has to overcome in order to let a particle enter @xmath3 .",
    "how rich the set of critical configurations is depends on the relative magnitude of these barriers .",
    "consequently , the geometry of the critical configurations is highly sensitive to the choice of parameters .",
    "the problem of computing the value @xmath12 , i.e. , the cardinality of the set of protocritical configurations , is reduced to counting the number of polyominoes of minimal perimeter belonging to certain classes of configurations that depend on the values of the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this is a non - trivial problem that is interesting in its own right . with these results we are able to derive the sharp asymptotics for the nucleation time and to find the entrance distribution of the set of critical configurations .",
    "results in this paper are derived by using a foliation of the state space according to the number of particles of type @xmath19 in @xmath3 , plus the fact that configurations in @xmath11 must satisfy a `` gate property '' , i.e. , they must be visited by all optimal paths .",
    "these results allow us to compute sharp asymptotic values for the expected nucleation time .",
