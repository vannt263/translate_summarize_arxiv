    "one of the most challenging and fascinating goals of modern physics is the achievement of a fully quantitative understanding of the strong interaction , which is the subject of hadron physics .",
    "significant progress has been achieved over the past few years thanks to considerable advances in experiment and theory .",
    "new experimental results have stimulated a very intense theoretical activity and a refinement of the theoretical tools .",
    "still there are many fundamental questions which remain basically unanswered .",
    "phenomena such as the confinement of quarks , the existence of glueballs and hybrids , the origin of the masses of hadrons in the context of the breaking of chiral symmetry are long - standing puzzles and represent the intellectual challenge in our attempt to understand the nature of the strong interaction and of hadronic matter .",
    "experimentally , studies of hadron structure can be performed with different probes such electrons , pions , kaons , protons or antiprotons . in antiproton - proton annihilation particles with gluonic degrees of freedom as well as",
    "particle - antiparticle pairs are copiously produced , allowing spectroscopic studies with very high statistics and precision .",
    "therefore , antiprotons are an excellent tool to address the open problems",
    ".    the recently approved fair facility ( facility for antiproton and ion research ) , which will be built as a major upgrade of the existing gsi laboratory in germany , will provide antiproton beams of the highest quality in terms of intensity and resolution , which will provide an excellent tool to answer these fundamental questions .",
    "the panda experiment ( pbar annihilations at darmstadt ) will use the antiproton beam from the high - energy storage ring ( hesr ) colliding with an internal proton target and a general purpose spectrometer to carry out a rich and diversified hadron physics program , which includes charmonium and open charm spectroscopy , the search for exotic hadrons and the study of in - medium modifications of hadron masses .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we will give an overview of the fair facility and the hesr ; in section 3 we will discuss some of the most significant items of the panda experimental program ; in section 4 we will give a brief description of the panda detector .",
    "finally in section 5 we will present our conclusions .",
    "the planned fair complex is shown in fig .",
    "the heart of the system consists of two synchrotron rings , called sis100 and sis300 , housed in the same tunnel , which will provide proton and ion beams of unprecedented quality .",
    "the sis100 , a 100 t@xmath0 m proton ring , will feed the radioactive ion and antiproton beam lines for experiments to be carried out in the high - energy storage ring ( hesr ) , the collector and cooler rings ( cr ) and the new experimental storage ring ( nesr ) .",
    "the sis300 will deliver high energy ion beams for the study of ultra relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the accelerators of fair will feature significant improvements in system parameters over existing facilities :    * * beam intensity * : increased by a factor of 100 to 1000 for primary and 10000 for secondary beams ; * * beam energy * will increase by a factor 30 for heavy ions ; * * beam variety * : fair will offer a variety of beam lines , from antiprotons to protons , to uranium and radioactive ions ; * * beam precision * : availability of cooled antiproton and ion beams ( stochastic and electron cooling ) ; * * parallel operation * : full accelerator performance for up to four different , independent experiments and experimental programs .",
    "these features will make fair a first rate facility for experiments in particle , nuclear , atomic , plasma and applied physics .",
    "the antiproton beam will be produced by a primary proton beam from the sis100 .",
    "the @xmath1 production rate will be of approximately @xmath2/s .",
    "after @xmath3 have been produced they will be transferred to the hesr , where internal experiments in the @xmath1 momentum range from 1 gev / c to 15 gev / c can be performed .",
    "[ fig : hesr ]        the layout of the hesr is shown in fig .",
    "2 . it is a racetrack ring , 574 meters in length , with two straight sections which will host the electron cooling and , respectively , the panda experiment .",
    "two modes of operation are foreseen : in the high - luminosity mode peak luminosities of @xmath4@xmath5s@xmath6 will be reached with a beam momentum spread @xmath7 , achieved by means of stochastic cooling ; in the high - resolution mode for beam momenta below 8 gev / c electron cooling will yield a smaller beam momentum spread @xmath8 at a reduced luminosity of @xmath9@xmath5s@xmath6 .",
    "the high - resolution mode will allow to measure directly the total width of very narrow ( below 1 mev ) resonances .",
    "the panda experiment has a rich experimental program whose ultimate aim is to improve our knowledge of the strong interaction and of hadron structure .",
    "the experiment is being designed to fully exploit the extraordinary physics potential arising from the availability of high - intensity , cooled antiproton beams .",
    "significant progress beyond the present understanding of the field is expected thanks to improvements in statistics and precision of the data .",
    "many experiments are foreseen in panda . in this paper",
    "we will discuss the following :    * charmonium spectroscopy ; * search for gluonic excitations ( hybrids and glueballs ) ; * study of hadrons in nuclear matter ; * open charm spectroscopy .",
    "ever since its discovery in 1974 @xcite charmonium has been a powerful tool for the understanding of the strong interaction .",
    "the high mass of the @xmath10 quark ( m@xmath11 @xmath12 1.5  gev / c@xmath13 ) makes it plausible to attempt a description of the dynamical properties of the ( @xmath14 ) system in terms of non - relativistic potential models , in which the functional form of the potential is chosen to reproduce the asymptotic properties of the strong interaction .",
    "the free parameters in these models are to be determined from a comparison with the experimental data .",
    "now , more than thirty years after the @xmath15 discovery , charmonium physics continues to be an exciting and interesting field of research .",
    "the recent discoveries of new states ( @xmath16 , x(3872 ) ) , and the exploitation of the b factories as rich sources of charmonium states have given rise to renewed interest in heavy quarkonia , and stimulated a lot of experimental and theoretical activities .",
    "over the past few years a significant progress has been achieved by lattice gauge theory calculations , which have become increasingly more capable of dealing quantitatively with non perturbative dynamics in all its aspects , starting from the first principles of qcd .",
    "experimentally charmonium has been studied mainly in @xmath17 and @xmath18 experiments .    in @xmath17 annihilations direct charmonium formation",
    "is possible only for states with the quantum numbers of the photon @xmath19 , namely the @xmath15 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 resonances .",
    "precise measurements of the masses and widths of these states can be obtained from the energy of the electron and positron beams , which are known with good accuracy .",
    "all other states can be reached by means of other production mechanisms , such as photon - photon fusion , initial state radiation , b - meson decay and double charmonium .    on the other hand",
    "all @xmath14 states can be directly formed in @xmath18 annihilations , through the coherent annihilation of the three quarks in the proton with the three antiquarks in the antiproton .",
    "this technique , originally proposed by p. dalpiaz in 1979 @xcite , could be successfully employed a few years later at cern and fermilab thanks to the development of stochastic cooling . with this method",
    "the masses and widths of all charmonium states can be measured with excellent accuracy , determined by the very precise knowledge of the initial @xmath18 state and not limited by the resolution of the detector .",
    "the cross section for the process : @xmath22 is given ( in units @xmath23 ) by the well known breit - wigner formula : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) energy and momentum ; @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the resonance spin , mass and total width and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the branching ratios into the initial ( @xmath18 ) and final states . due to the finite energy spread of the beam ,",
    "the measured cross section is a convolution of the breit - wigner cross section , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bw ] ) , and the beam energy distribution function @xmath32 ; the effective production rate @xmath33 is given by : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the instanteneous luminosity , @xmath36 an overall efficiency @xmath37 acceptance factor and @xmath38 a background term .",
    "the parameters of a given resonance can be extracted by measuring the formation rate for that resonance as a function of the c.m .",
    ". the accurate determination of masses and widths depends crucially on the precise knowledge of the absolute energy scale and on the beam energy spectrum .     carried out at fermilab ( a ) and beam energy distribution in each data point ( b ) . [",
    "fig : chi1scan],width=302 ]    the technique is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi1scan ] which shows a scan of the @xmath40 resonance carried out at the fermilab antiproton accumulator by the e835 experiment  @xcite using the process @xmath41 .",
    "for each point of the scan the horizontal error bar in ( a ) corresponds to the width of the beam energy distribution .",
    "the actual beam energy distribution is shown in ( b ) .",
    "this scan allowed the e835 experiment to carry out the most precise measurement of the mass ( @xmath42 mev / c@xmath13 ) and total width ( @xmath43 mev ) of this resonance .      the spectrum of charmonium states is shown in fig .  [ fig : ccspectrum ] .",
    ", width=302 ]    it consists of eight narrow states below the open charm threshold ( 3.73 gev ) and several tens of states above the threshold .",
    "all eight states * below @xmath44 threshold * are well established , but whereas the triplet states are measured with very good accuracy , the same can not be said for the singlet states .",
    "the @xmath45 was discovered almost thirty years ago and many measurements of its mass and total width exist , with six new measurements in the last four years . still the situation is far from satisfactory .",
    "the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite value of the mass is @xmath46 mev / c@xmath13 , an average of eight measurements with an internal confidence level of 0.026 : the error on the @xmath45 mass is still as large as 1.2 mev / c@xmath13 , to be compared with few tens of kev / c@xmath13 for the @xmath15 and @xmath20 and few hundreds of kev / c@xmath13 for the @xmath47 states .",
    "the situation is even worse for the total width : the pdg average is @xmath48 mev , with an overall confidence level of only 0.001 and individual measurements ranging from 7 mev to 34.3 mev .",
    "the most recent measurements have shown that the @xmath45 width is larger than was previously believed , with values which are difficult to accomodate in quark models .",
    "this situation points to the need for new high - precision measurements of the @xmath45 parameters .",
    "the first experimental evidence of the @xmath49 was reported by the crystal ball collaboration  @xcite , but this finding was not confirmed in subsequent searches in @xmath18 or @xmath17 experiments .",
    "the @xmath49 was finally discovered by the belle collaboration  @xcite in the hadronic decay of the b meson @xmath50 with a mass which was incompatible with the crystal ball candidate .",
    "the belle finding was then confirmed by cleo  @xcite and babar  @xcite which observed this state in two - photon fusion .",
    "the pdg value of the mass is @xmath51 mev / c@xmath13 , corresponding to a surprisingly small hyperfine splitting of @xmath52 mev / c@xmath13 , whereas the total width is only measured with an accuracy of 50% .",
    "the study of this state has just started and all its properties need to be measured with good accuracy .",
    "the @xmath53 state of charmonium ( @xmath54 ) is of particular importance in the determination of the spin - dependent component of the @xmath55 confinement potential .",
    "the fermilab experiment e760 reported an @xmath54 candidate in the decay channel @xmath56  @xcite , with a mass of @xmath57 mev / c@xmath13 .",
    "this finding was not confirmed by the successor experiment e835 , which however observed an enhancement in the @xmath58  @xcite final state at a mass of @xmath59 mev / c@xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath54 was finally observed by the cleo collaboration  @xcite in the process @xmath60 with @xmath61 , in which the @xmath45 was identified via its hadronic decays .",
    "they found a value for the mass of @xmath62 mev / c@xmath13 .",
    "it is clear that the study of this state has just started and that many more measurements will be needed to determine its properties , in particular the width .",
    "the region * above @xmath44 threshold * is rich in interesting new physics . in this region , close to the @xmath44 threshold ,",
    "one expects to find the four 1d states .",
    "of these only the @xmath63 , identified with the @xmath64(3770 ) resonance , has been found .",
    "the @xmath65 states ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) are predicted to be narrow , because parity conservation forbids their decay to @xmath44 .",
    "in addition to the d states , the radial excitations of the s and p states are predicted to occur above the open charm threshold .",
    "none of these states have been positively identified .",
    "the experimental knowledge of this energy region comes from data taken at the early @xmath17 experiments at slac and desy and , more recently , at the b - factories , cleo - c and bes .",
    "the structures and the higher vector states observed by the early @xmath17 experiments have not all been confirmed by the latest much more accurate measurements by bes  @xcite .",
    "a lot of new states have recently been discovered at the b - factories , mainly in the hadronic decays of the meson : these new states ( x , y , z ... ) are associated with charmonium because they decay predominantly into charmonium states such as the @xmath15 or the @xmath20 , but their interpretation is far from obvious .",
    "the situation can be roughly summarized as follows :    * the z(3931 )  @xcite , observed in two - photon fusion and decaying predominantly into @xmath44 , is tentatively identified with the @xmath68(2s ) ; * the x(3940 )  @xcite , observed in double charmonium events , is tentatively identified with the @xmath45(3s ) ; * for all other new states ( x(3872 ) , y(3940 ) , y(4260 ) , y(4320 ) and so on ) the interpretation is not at all clear , with speculations ranging from the missing @xmath14 states , to molecules , tetraquark states , and hybrids .",
    "it is obvious that further measurements are needed to determine the nature of these new resonances",
    ".    the main challenge of the next years will be thus to understand what these new states are and to match these experimental findings to the theoretical expectations for charmonium above threshold .",
    "charmonium spectroscopy is one of the main items in the experimental program of panda , and the design of the detector and of the accelerator are optimized to be well suited for this kind of physics .",
    "panda will represent a substantial improvement over the fermilab experiments e760 and e835 :    * up to ten times higher instantaneous luminosity ( @xmath69@xmath5s@xmath6 in high - luminosity mode , compared to @xmath70@xmath5s@xmath6 at fermilab ) ; * better beam momentum resolution ( @xmath71 in high - resolution mode , compared with @xmath72 at fermilab ) ; * a better detector ( higher angular coverage , magnetic field , ability to detect the hadronic decay modes ) .    at full luminosity panda",
    "will be able to collect several thousand @xmath14 states per day . by means of fine scans",
    "it will be possible to measure masses with accuracies of the order of 100 kev and widths to 10% or better .",
    "the entire energy region below and above open charm threshold will be explored .",
    "one of the main challenges of hadron physics , and an important item in the panda physics program , is the search for gluonic excitations , i.e. hadrons in which the gluons can act as principal components . these _ _",
    "g__luonic hadrons fall into two main categories : glueballs , i.e. states of pure glue , and hybrids , which consist of a @xmath55 pair and excited glue .",
    "the additional degrees of freedom carried by gluons allow these hybrids and glueballs to have @xmath73 exotic quantum numbers : in this case mixing effects with nearby @xmath55 states are excluded and this makes their experimental identification easier .",
    "the properties of glueballs and hybrids are determined by the long - distance features of qcd and their study will yield fundamental insight into the structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "antiproton - proton annihilations provide a very favourable environment in which to look for gluonic hadrons .",
    "two particles , first seen in @xmath74 scattering  @xcite with exotic quantum numbers @xmath75 , @xmath76  @xcite and @xmath77  @xcite , are clearly seen in @xmath18 annihilation at rest . on the other hand a narrow state at 1500 mev / c@xmath13 discovered in @xmath18 annihilations by the crystal barrel experiment",
    "@xcite , is considered the best candidate for the glueball ground state ( @xmath78 ) , even though the mixing with nearby @xmath55 states makes this interpretation difficult .",
    "so far the experimental search for glueballs and hybrids has been mainly carried out in the mass region below 2.2 mev / c@xmath13 .",
    "panda will extend the search to higher masses and in particular to the charmonium mass region , were light quark states form a structure - less continuum and heavy quark states are far fewer in number . therefore exotic hadrons in this mass region could be resolved and identified unambiguously .",
    "the spectrum of charmonium hybrid mesons can be calculated within the framework of various theoretical models , such as the bag model , the flux tube model , the constituent quark model and recently , with increasing precision , from lattice qcd ( lqcd ) . for these calculations",
    "the parameters are fixed according to the properties of the known @xmath55 states .",
    "all model predictions and lqcd calculations agree that the masses of the lowest lying charmonium hybrids are between 4.2 gev / c@xmath13 and 4.5 gev / c@xmath13 .",
    "three of these states are expected to have @xmath73 exotic quantum numbers ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) , making their experimental identification easier since they will not mix with nearby @xmath14 states .",
    "these states are expected to be narrower than conventional charmonium , because their decay to open charm will be suppressed or forbidden below the @xmath82 threshold .",
    "the cross sections for the formation and production of charmonium hybrids are estimated to be similar to those of normal charmonium states , which are within experimental reach .",
    "formation experiments will generate only non - exotic charmonium hybrids , whereas production experiments will yield both exotic and non - exotic states .",
    "this feature can be exploited experimentally : the observation of a state in production but not in formation will be , in itself , a strong hint of exotic behavior .",
    "the glueball spectrum can be calculated within the framework of lqcd in the quenched approximation  @xcite . in the mass range accessible to panda as many as 15 glueball states",
    "are predicted , some with exotic quantum numbers ( _ oddballs _ ) . as with hybrids ,",
    "exotic glueballs are easier to identify experimentally since they do not mix with conventional mesons .",
    "the complications arising from mixing with normal @xmath55 states is well illustrated by the case of the f@xmath83(1500 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , this narrow state , observed at lear by the crystal barrel  @xcite and obelix  @xcite experiments , is considered the best candidate for the ground state glueball .",
    "however this interpretation is not unique , and relies on the combined analysis of the complete set of two - body decays of the f@xmath83(1500 ) and two other scalar states , the f@xmath83(1370 ) and the f@xmath83(1710 ) .",
    "this analysis yields the following mixing picture  @xcite : @xmath84 .",
    "other scenarios for the scalar meson nonet not involving a glueball have been proposed and this makes the interpretation of the f@xmath83(1500 ) as the ground state glueball ambiguous .",
    "this example highlights the need to extend the glueball search to higher mass regions , which are free of the problem of mixing with conventional @xmath55 states .",
    "the study of medium modifications of hadrons embedded in hadronic matter is aimed at understanding the origin of hadron masses in the context of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd and its partial restoration in a hadronic environment .",
    "so far experiments have been focussed on the light quark sector : evidence of mass changes for pions and kaons have been deduced by the study of deeply bound pionic atoms  @xcite and of k meson production in proton - nucleus and heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the high - intensity @xmath1 beam of up to 15  gev / c will allow an extension of this program to the charm sector both for hadrons with hidden and open charm .",
    "the in - medium masses of these states are expected to be affected primarily by the gluon condensate .",
    "recent theoretical calculations predict small mass shifts ( 5 - 10 mev / c@xmath13 ) for the low - lying charmonium states  @xcite and more consistent effects for the @xmath47 ( 40 mev / c@xmath13 ) , @xmath20 ( 100 mev / c@xmath13 ) and @xmath64(3770 ) ( 140 mev / c@xmath13 )  @xcite .",
    "d mesons , on the other hand , offer the unique opportunity to study the in - medium dynamics of a system with a single light quark .",
    "recent theoretical calculations agree in the prediction of a mass splitting for d mesons in nuclear matter but , unfortunately , they disagree in sign and size of the effect .",
    "experimentally the in - medium masses of charmonium states can be reconstructed from their decay into di - leptons and photons , which are not affected by final state interaction .",
    "d meson masses , on the other hand , need to be reconstructed by their weak decays into pions and kaons which makes the direct measurement of mass modifications difficult .",
    "therefore other signals have been proposed for the detection of in - medium mass shifts of d mesons : in particular it has been speculated that a lowering of the @xmath44 threshold would result in an increased @xmath85 and @xmath86 production in @xmath1-nucleus annihilations  @xcite or in an increase in width of the charmonium states lying close to the threshold  @xcite .",
    "another study which can be carried out in panda is the measurement of @xmath15 and d meson production cross sections in @xmath1 annihilation on a series of nuclear targets .",
    "the comparison of the resonant @xmath15 yield obtained from @xmath1 annihilation on protons and different nuclear targets allows to deduce the @xmath15-nucleus dissociation cross section , a fundamental parameter to understand @xmath15 suppression in relativistic heavy ion collisions interpreted as a signal for quark - gluon plasma formation .",
    "the hesr running at full luminosity and at @xmath1 momenta larger than 6.4  gev / c would produce a large number of @xmath85 meson pairs .",
    "the high yield ( e.g. 100 charm pairs per second around the @xmath64(4040 ) ) and the well defined production kinematics of @xmath85 meson pairs would allow to carry out a significant charmed meson spectroscopy program which would include , for example , the rich @xmath85 and @xmath87 meson spectra .",
    "[ dspectrum ]     spectrum.,width=302 ]    the b - factory experiments have discovered several new resonances in the @xmath85 and @xmath87 sectors , where two are extremely narrow : the @xmath88(2317 )  @xcite and the @xmath88(2317 )  @xcite .",
    "these new states appear at unexpected locations , since their masses are more than 140  mev / c@xmath13 lower than expected from potential models , as shown in fig .",
    "this has given rise to speculations about their nature .",
    "it is important to verify these findings by means of new measurements .",
    "threshold pair production can be employed for precision measurements of the mass and the width of the narrow excited @xmath85 states .",
    "in order to carry out the physics program discussed above the panda detector must fulfil a number of requirements : it must provide ( nearly ) full solid angle coverage , it must be able to handle high rates ( @xmath89 annihilations / s ) with good particle identification and momentum resolution for @xmath90 , e , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , k and p. additional requirements include vertex reconstruction capability and , for charmonium , a pointlike interaction region , efficient lepton identification and excellent calorimetry ( both in terms of resolution and of sensitivity to low - energy showers ) .        a schematic view of the panda detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : det ] .",
    "the antiprotons circulating in the hesr hit an internal hydrogen target ( either pellet or cluster jet ) , while for the nuclear part of the experimental program wire or fiber targets will be used .",
    "the apparatus consists of a central detector , called target spectrometer ( ts ) and a forward spectrometer ( fs ) .",
    "the ts , for the measurement of particles emitted at laboratory angles larger than 5@xmath93 , will be located inside a solenoidal magnet which provides a field of 2  t. its main components will be a microvertex silicon detector , a central tracker ( either a straw tube detector or a time projection chamber ) , an inner time - of - flight telescope , a cylindrical dirc ( detector of internally reflected light ) for particle identification , an electromagnetic calorimeter consisting of pbwo@xmath94 crystals , a set of muon counters and of multiwire drift chambers .    the fs will detect particles emitted at polar angles below 10@xmath93 in the horizontal and 5@xmath93 in the vertical direction .",

    "all these new measurements will make it possible to achieve a very significant progress in our understanding of qcd and the strong interaction .",
