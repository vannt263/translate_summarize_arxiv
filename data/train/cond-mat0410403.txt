    ", this enhancement of the piezoelectric constant may not be very useful in practical applications as the multi - domain states are not stable over a large range of electric fields .",
    "we also considered the case where an electric field along the [ 11 ] direction is applied to the same multi - domain states .",
    "this situation is analogous to the experiments of wada and tsurumi @xcite who studied the piezoelectric properties of tetragonal domain engineered @xmath1 single crystals under an electric field along [ 111 ] . for this case",
    ", we found that the multi - domain states remain stable until a field induced rectangular to rhombic transition takes place .",
