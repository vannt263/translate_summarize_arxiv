    "deep exposures of ulss have shown the presence of a hard tail , possibly due to a disk - like emission similar to ulxs ( see , e.g , urquhart and soria 2016 ) .",
    "classical x - ray binaries and ulxs , either have broad - band emission over the 110 kev range or a peak disk - blackbody temperature of a few kev .",
    "alternative models have tried to describe the x - ray spectra of ulss with accreting intermediate - mass and stellar - mass black holes like for ulxs or with extreme supersoft sources powered by surface - nuclear - burning on white dwarf accretors ( see , e.g. , di stefano & kong 2004 , soria & kong 2016 , feng et al .",

    "ulxs and ulss were initially considered different physical types of systems . however , on the one hand , we have seen strong evidence of winds in ulxs ( middleton et al .",
    "2015b , pinto et al . 2016 ) .",
    "on the other hand , some ulss ( e.g. in m101 and ngc247 ) exhibit a harder ( fast variable ) x - ray tail ( e.g. , urquhart and soria 2016 ) , suggesting that some of the x - ray photons occasionally get through a rapidly changing wind ( e.g. , middleton et al .",
    "2011 and takeuchi et al .",
    "there is evidence that ulxs and ulss are simply two types of super - eddington accretors , with respectively geometrically thinner and thicker outflows along the line of sight due to different viewing angles or mass accretion rates ( e.g. poutanen et al .",
    "2007 ; urquhart and soria 2016 ; feng et al .",
    "2016 and reference therein ) . to some extent",
    ", this scenario is similar to the unification scenario proposed for active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , elvis 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "the core of our work is to test this model through the study of a bright and well isolated transitional object , which looks like a ulx when the wind is not optically thick and then becomes a uls when the wind thickens : ngc 55 ulx .",
    "the study of winds in ulxs and ulss is now possible after our recent discovery ( pinto et al .",

    "2016a ) .",
    "the timing properties of ulxs provide an independent diagnostic of the accretion process .",
    "heil & vaughan ( 2010 ) first detected a linear correlation between variability amplitude and flux in the ultraluminous x - ray source ngc 5408 x-1 , similar to that found in galactic x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , uttley & mchardy 2001 and vaughan et al .",
    "heil & vaughan ( 2010 ) also found evidence of time delays between soft and hard energy bands , with the softer bands delayed with respect to the hard at frequencies of @xmath6 mhz .",
    "these time delays were later confirmed by de marco et al .",

    "the epic ccd spectra of ngc 55 ulx can be modelled with a broad - band component from the innermost region ( either as a disk blackbody or as comptonization ) plus the standard t @xmath1 0.15 kev blackbody , which we see in most ulss and the softest ulxs and probably originates from reprocessed emission , such as compton down - scattered emission , and intrinsic disk emission ( e.g. , sutton et al .",
    "2013 and pintore et al .",
    "the spectrum is very soft ( slope @xmath10 , if modelled with a powerlaw ) similar to ulss , but there is significant flux and a bright hard tail above 1kev ( see sect.[sec : epic_continuum ] ) , which is stronger than typical ulss ( e.g. , urquhart and soria 2016 ) .",
    "more detail on the comparison between ngc 55 ulx , other ulxs , and ulss is provided in sect.[sec : discussion_continuum ] .",
    "owing to its spectral variability and spectral shape ngc 55 ulx shows the characteristics of both ulxs and ulss and provides a unique workbench to study the transition between the two phases .",
    "the search for a wind in this object is highly motivated by the detection of soft x - ray residuals in the epic spectra of ngc 55 ulx that are similar in both shape and energy ( @xmath11kev ) to those that we observed and resolved in other ulxs ( see , e.g. , middleton et al .",

    "2001 ) and the high - resolution reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs , @xmath15kev ) aboard xmm-_newton _ ( den herder et al . 2001 ) in order to constrain the spectral shape of the source and to search for evidence of a wind .",

    "we also extracted epic - pn spectra from within a circular region of 1 arcmin diameter centred on the emission peak .",

    "we fitted the epic - pn spectrum with the new spex code v3.02 to constrain the broad - band continuum .",
    "each of mos 1 and 2 cameras has 34 times less effective area than pn , which alone contains the vast majority of the counts .",

    "we focused on the pn spectrum of the second ( 0655050101 ) exposure to determine the best fitting continuum model because it has twice as many counts as the first observation , shows less variability , and its continuum determination is crucial for following high - resolution analysis .",
    "we tested two alternative models to describe the broadband epic - pn spectrum of ngc 55 : a combination of blackbody ( _ bb _ ) plus powerlaw ( _ po _ ) and a combination of blackbody ( _ bb _ ) plus disk blackbody modified by coherent compton scattering ( _ mbb _ , see spex manual for more detail ) .",

    "( 2015 ) for _ chandra _ and _ swift _ observations of ngc 55 ulx .",
    "moreover , the power - law model would imply a very high luminosity since the deabsorbed model diverges at low energies .",
    "the harder multicolour component is seen in most ulxs , although its temperature is typically 1.52.5 kev ( hence the origin of the characteristic downturn at @xmath1 56 kev ) . in the softest states of ulxs",
    "( e.g. in ngc 55 ulx ) and in ulss can be as low as 0.7 kev .",
    "it is thought to consist of emission produced by the inner accretion disk highly distorted by interaction with hot electrons in the inner regions ( up - scattering ) and by down - scattering with cool electrons in the wind ( e.g. gladstone et al .",
    "2009 , middleton et al . 2011a , middleton et al .",
    "the soft ( @xmath22kev ) component is likely to be intrinsic to regions above the outer disk , where a radiatively - driven wind is expected to be launched at accretion rates comparable or higher than the eddington limit ( poutanen et al . 2007 ) .",
    "our broadband spectral fits are consistent with ngc 55 ulx being a soft ultraluminous x - ray source according to the classification of sutton et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "the first , shorter , observation also favours a multi - blackbody emission model .",
    "the epic spectrum in 2001 basically exhibits hotter blackbody components ( see below and table[table : epic_flux_resolved_spectra ] ) .",
    "interestingly , we found that the emitting area of the soft ( @xmath22kev ) blackbody component increases by a factor 2 from the brighter ( 2001 ) to the fainter ( 2010 ) observation in agreement with the study of ulss of urquhart and soria ( 2016 ) and feng et al .",
    "this is expected if the expansion of the photosphere and the decrease of the temperature shift the peak of the spectrum from x - ray towards the far - uv .",
    "as previously mentioned , ulss show a faint hard x - ray tail ( @xmath23 1.5 kev ) whose origin is not quite understood .",
    "it is thought to be produced in the inner regions similar to ulxs and characterized by either bremsstrahlung or comptonization emission ( see , e.g. , urquhart and soria 2016 ) . as a test",
    ", we have re - fitted the ngc 55 ulx epic spectrum by substituting the _ mbb _ component with a rest - frame bremsstrahlung or collisionally - ionized emission model ( @xmath24 model in spex ) .",
    "bb + brems _ fit is bad ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we also tried to get an upper limit on the emission of a putative bremsstrahlung component adding it on top of the best - fit _ bb + mbb _ model .",
    "the maximum flux a bremsstrahlung component can have is 10 times smaller than the flux of the _ mbb _ component .",
    "the bremsstrahlung temperature was however highly unconstrained .",
    "therefore , if the hard x - ray tail seen in ulss is similar to the one that is well constrained in ngc 55 ulx , then a disk origin would be favoured .",
    "although the double blackbody model provides a better fit , it is still statistically rejected .",
    "the presence of strong residuals around 1kev shows an important similarity with the residuals seen in several ulxs with long exposures ( emission peak at 1kev and absorption - like features on both sides ) .",
    "middleton et al .",
    "( 2014 , 2015b ) interpreted them as either due to emission by collisionally - ionized gas or to absorption by outflowing photoionized gas .",

    "our analysis focuses on the @xmath26 first order rgs 1 and 2 spectra from the long , on - axis , observation 2 ( 0655050101 ) .",
    "below 7 the effective area is not well calibrated and above 27 the countrate is too low . for the rgs analysis we have to use c - statistics because of the poisson statistics and the need for high spectral resolution .",
    "the spectrum was binned in channels equal to 1/3 of the spectral resolution for the optimal binning ( see kaastra and bleeker 2016 ) .",
    "we plot the epic continuum models on top of the rgs data in fig.[fig : rgs_spectrum ] . as for epic",
    ", the double blackbody spectral model describes the rgs spectrum better than the blackbody+powerlaw combination , although rgs does not have the same sensitivity .",
    "therefore , the choice of the continuum will not have a dramatic effect on our results .",
    "we fit the epic model to the rgs spectrum leaving only the overall normalization as a free parameter and obtained a comparable fit with the overall flux lower by about 10 percent compared to the epic continuum model ( see the solid blue line in fig.[fig : rgs_spectrum ] ) .",
    "this rgs continuum model is used in the following analysis .",
    "one of the major issues in modelling the rgs spectra of faint sources , such as ulxs , is the background . however , ngc 55 ulx is significantly brighter than the background between 725",
    ". moreover the source is reasonably isolated ; the rgs slit does not encounter any other bright object ( see fig.[fig : ngc55_epic_map ] ) and the background spectrum is rather featureless . for more detail see appendix[sec : rgs_background ] .      following our approach in paperi , we searched for spectral features on top of the spectral continuum by fitting a gaussian spanning the @xmath26 wavelength range with increments of 0.05 and calculated the @xmath27c - statistics .",

    "the 21.8 emission - like feature could be a blueshifted 22.1 forbidden line .",

    "the covariance spectra extracted at different frequencies are very similar with the current statistics , but more data would certainly help to distinguish some differences at low and high frequencies .",

    "urquhart and soria ( 2016 ) modelled the soft x - ray spectral features and the @xmath11kev ( @xmath87 ) drop in several ccd spectra of ulss with a model of thermal emission and an absorption edge .",
    "they interpreted the features as a result of absorption and photon reprocessing by an optically - thick wind which obscures the innermost regions where most hard x - rays are produced .",
    "this suggested that ulss are actually ulxs viewed almost edge on or maybe their outflow is thicker , at the same viewing angle . a denser , more optically thick outflow may be the result of higher accretion rates above eddington , assuming that m@xmath88 is proportional to m@xmath89 ( e.g. , shakura and sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "moreover , at higher super - eddington rates , the outflow launching region moves to larger radii on the disk , where the escape velocity and the compton temperature are lower , which favours denser winds ( e.g. , poutanen et al . 2007 ) . motivated by our recent detection of relativistic winds in the ngc1313 and ngc5408 ulx-1 high - resolution rgs spectra taken with xmm-_newton _ ( see paperi ) , we searched for a deep rgs observation of an object that shows the properties of both the ulx and uls categories and found ngc 55 ulx .",
    "the primary goal of our study was the search for unambiguous signatures of a wind .",
    "the detection of ( unresolved ) spectral residuals in previous work done on ngc 55 ulx was certainly encouraging ( e.g. middleton et al .",
    "we confirmed the presence of these residuals particularly in the 2010 epic deep spectrum ( see figs.[fig : epic_continuum ] and [ fig : epic_flux_resolved_spectra ] ) .",
    "the evidence hinting at a wind was confirmed when we looked at the high - resolution rgs spectrum of ngc 55 ulx , which shows a wealth of emission and absorption features located at energies that are blueshifted compared to the energies of the strongest atomic transitions in the soft x - ray energy band ( see figs.[fig : rgs_spectrum ] and [ fig : line_detection ] ) .",
    "accurate spectral modelling shows the presence of an outflowing plasma with a complex ionization and velocity structure ( see figs.[fig : rgs_spectrum_fit ] and [ fig : wind_structure_idl ] ) .",
    "the best - fitting models suggest photoionization , but we can not exclude some contribution from collisional ionization , particularly for high - ionization species .",
    "the gas responsible for the emission lines moves with velocities @xmath90 lower than those exhibited by the absorbing gas @xmath91 , see table[table : improvements ] and fig.[fig : wind_structure_idl ] .",
    "both the emission and the absorption lines indicate that the ionization state increases with the outflow velocity suggesting that we are detecting hotter / faster phases coming from inner regions .",
    "our limited statistics prevents us from claiming the detection of more than two photoionized emitters and absorbers in the line of sight , but additional observations would certainly help to understand the ionization and velocity structure of the wind in ngc 55 ulx .",
    "an interesting result is the spectral signature of the high - ionization ( @xmath92 ) absorber with the largest column density .",
    "this component absorbs a substantial amount of photons below 12 ( or above 1kev ) , which provides a natural explanation for the spectral shape of ngc 55 ulx and the drop seen in several ulss ( e.g. urquhart and soria 2016 ) .",
    "the main difference is that such a turnover is more pronounced in ulss because they are seen more edge on or because the photosphere of the wind is simply further out due to a larger accretion rate ( see e.g. middleton et al .",
    "2015a and urquhart and soria 2016 ) with resulting increased obscuration of the inner regions .",
    "it is useful to compare the wind power to the bolometric radiative luminosity of the source .",
    "the kinetic luminosity of the outflow or wind power @xmath93 can be expressed as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the ionizing luminosity , @xmath96 is the proton mass , @xmath97 is the mean atomic weight ( @xmath98 for solar abundances ) , @xmath99 is the outflow velocity , @xmath100 is the volume filling factor ( or ` clumpiness ' ) , @xmath101 is the solid angle , and @xmath34 is the ionization parameter of the wind .",
    "we calculated the ratio between the wind power and the bolometric luminosity for the fast and most significant absorber ( see table[table : improvements ] ) and obtained : @xmath102 . according to the simulations of takeuchi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , a wind driven by a strong radiation field in super - eddington accretion has a typical clumpiness factor of @xmath103 and is launched over wide angles of @xmath104 from the disk rotation axis .",
    "a significant fraction of the source radiative luminosity ( @xmath105 ) must have been used to ionize the wind before some reprocessing occurred . in our broadband",
    "epic fits we found that , on average , the 0.310kev total source flux was equally partioned between the hard ( disk ) and soft ( reprocessed ) components .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to adopt @xmath106 .",
    "this provides @xmath107 , which is similar to that measured for ngc 1313 x-1 and ngc 5408 x-1 ( see paperi and walton at al .",
    "2016a ) , but is an extreme value if compared to the strongest outflows seen from sub - eddington systems , e.g. active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , fabian 2012 , and references therein ) .",
    "we studied the timing and spectral properties of ngc 55 ulx to understand if they also suggest that the source is a transition between classical ulxs and ulss .",
    "if the thick , outflowing , wind scenario is correct then we should expect a correlation between the spectral hardness of the source and the x - ray flux ( e.g. within 0.310kev ) .",
    "for instance , if either the accretion rate or the inclination decrease then the optical depth decreases , which corresponds to a lower down - scattering of the hard photons produced in the inner regions .",
    "we test this picture by splitting the observations in different flux regimes which provided five high - quality epic spectra ( see fig.[fig : epic_flux_resolved_spectra ] ) .",
    "we modelled the epic spectra with a spectral continuum consisting of a blackbody and a multicolour blackbody emission components in agreement with pintore et al .",
    "( 2015 ) and with our search for the best - fitting continuum .",
    "the temperatures of both components ( particularly the hotter multicolour blackbody ) significantly increase with the luminosity supporting the wind scenario ( see table[table : epic_flux_resolved_spectra ] ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the observed decrease in column density of the neutral absorber with luminosity ( the galactic interstellar medium account less than 10% according to the hi maps and does not affect our result ) . in support for this scenario we also found that the emitting area of the soft ( @xmath22kev ) blackbody component increased by a factor 2 from the brighter ( 2001 ) to the fainter ( 2010 ) observation in agreement with the study of ulss of urquhart and soria ( 2016 ) and feng et al .",
    "2016 , where the expansion of the photosphere and the decrease of the temperature shift the peak of the spectrum from the x - ray to the far - uv energy band .",
    "according to our spectral fits , the radius of the photosphere is 20003000 km and the temperature well above 0.15kev , which explains why ngc 55 still looks like ulx rather than a uls according to the classifications of sutton et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and urquhart and soria ( 2016 ) .",
    "this may suggest that either the inclination or the accretion rate in ngc 55 is smaller than in typical ulss .",
    "there are no striking dips in the 2010 exposure if compared to those in 2001 , which is not surprising since they were not detected in most recent observations taken with _",
    "chandra _ and _ swift _ ( see pintore et al .",
    "lightcurves extracted with the same binning are shown in appendix [ sec : epic_flux_resolved_lighcurves ] .",
    "we remark that the flux level in 2010 is consistent with the lowest level of 2001 , suggesting that the source is in a semi - obscured state ( see fig.[fig : lightcurves ] ) .",
    "the lack of variability and the low flux in 2010 is consistent with a picture where the innermost regions , which produce the high energy hard x - rays and the high variability , are partly obscured by an intervening absorber in agreement with the hypothesis of stobbart et al . (",
    "2004 ) , middleton et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and sutton et al .",
    "either the accretion rate increased , further inflating the outer regions of the disk , or the line of sight changed ( e.g. due to precession ) with further obscuration of the innermost `` hotter '' regions .",
    "the tentative detection of a large soft lag , @xmath11000s , at low frequencies further strengthens our scenario ( see fig.[fig : lags ] ) suggesting that the soft emitting gas in the wind and the upper disk photosphere are reprocessing the photons produced in the innermost regions .",
    "the covariance spectra computed within different frequency ranges follow the shape of the lag - energy spectra ( see fig.[fig : covariance ] ) , confirm this picture and show evidence for two possible main processes that produce variability : fluctuation within the inner disk ( harder ) and slow reprocessing through the wind ( softer ) .",
    "it is also possible that when the column density of the wind decreases the wind becomes optically thin , but the hard x - ray photons start penetrating the wind before the soft photons ( see , e.g. , kara et al .",
    "this may explain the source hardening when the luminosity increases . in a future project we will investigate all possible scenarios by comparing more sources and lags at different time scales .",
    "our results agree with middleton et al .",
    "( 2015a ) .",
    "they computed the covariance spectra on a broad frequency band and showed a significant lack of variability in the 2010 observation , suggesting that the variable , hard , x - ray component has intercepted cooler / optically thicker material .",
    "they also found that the shape of the covariance spectra in ngc 55 ulx and several other ulxs was consistent with the variability originating in the hard component only , which agrees with a model where the variability on short and long timescales at moderate inclinations is dominated by obscuration of the high energy emission .",
    "the lags tentatively detected here appear at much lower frequencies than those shown by heil et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and de marco et al .",
    "( 2013 ) in ngc 5408 x-1 .",
    "hernandez - garcia et al . ( 2015 ) also found evidence of a @xmath11ks time lag in ngc 5408 x-1 and showed that the time delays are energy - dependent and that their origin is not related to reflection from an accretion disk ( ` reverberation ' ) .",
    "they also argued that associating the soft lag with a quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) in these ulxs , drawing an analogy between soft lags in ulxs and soft lags seen in some low - frequency qpos of galactic x - ray binaries , is premature .",
    "the two orders of magnitude in time delays ( from a few seconds to hundred seconds in ngc 55 and ngc 5408 ulxs ) point towards a complex energy lag spectrum and we also caution from using lags to derive mass estimates without a comprehensive analysis in a large frequency range . although this is beyond the scope of this paper , we provide a simple argument to compare lags in agn , x - ray binaries , and ulxs . the lag magnitude in ngc 55 ulx as a function of the variability timescale",
    "is @xmath110% ( 1000s ; 1/f=10,000s ) .",
    "the hard lags in agn are typically 1% , the agn soft lags are @xmath12% ( e.g. , alston et al .",

    "2011 ) . de marco et al . ( 2013 ) measured about @xmath15% for the higher frequency lags in ngc 5408 x-1 .",
    "hence , it is possible that the processes causing these lags are different .",
    "the long soft lags in ngc 55 ulx and ngc 5408 x-1 could be related to some phenomena occurring in the outer region .",
    "in fact , the 1000s magnitude is likely due to the combination of light travel time plus thermalization in the wind and additional local scattering processes before the photons are re - emitted towards the observer .",
    "such phenomena imply a distance that can be large enough to damp the variability with a corresponding decreasing of the covariance at high frequencies ( see fig.[fig : covariance ] ) .",
    "the short ( a few seconds ) soft lags seen by heil et al .",

    "therefore , we briefly highlight why ngc 55 ulx looks like a transitional form between ulxs and ulss for the shape of its spectral continuum .",
    "more attention will be given on the way the detection of winds fits in the framework of super - eddington accretion .",
    "the higher - energy broad - band component is an interesting link between ulxs and ulss .",
    "the sequence from hard ulxs to soft ulxs and then to ulss shows a progressively lower temperature ( whether modelled as comptonization or a modified disk , e.g. , gladstone et al .",
    "the temperature is therefore a function of m@xmath88 and/or the viewing angle .",
    "the optical depth @xmath108 ( for a comptonization model ) instead increases along the same sequence , from @xmath109 few for hard ulxs to @xmath110 10 for soft ulxs , to @xmath108 @xmath111 infinity for ulss .",
    "alternatively , the photon index @xmath112 increases from @xmath1 1.5 to @xmath1 2.5 and then @xmath23 4 along the same sequence in analogy with the ( @xmath113,@xmath108 ) changes for a comptonizing region",
    ". the hard component of ngc 55 can be well modelled as either a steep ( @xmath10 ) power law or as a modified disk , which essentially means a large @xmath108 ( see e.g. tables [ table : continuum ] and [ table : epic_flux_resolved_spectra ] ) .",
    "this suggests that ngc 55 ulx is indeed a transitional object between the ulxs and ulss .",
    "the emission and absorption features detected in ngc 55 ulx are produced by the same ionic species detected in ngc 1313 x-1 and ngc 5408 x-1 rgs spectra ( see paperi ) .",
    "for instance , the properties of the most significant absorber detected in ngc 55 ulx ( see e.g. table[table : improvements ] ) seem to match those of the fast ( @xmath57 ) component in the other two ulxs .",
    "the detection of a multiphase structure in ngc 55 ulx would point towards a tighter analogy to ngc 5408 x-1 , which also exhibits a wind more complex than ngc 1313 x-1 , with different ionization states and outflow velocities .",
    "we notice that we also found evidence for an edge - like feature around 11 in the rgs spectrum of ngc6946 x-1 in paperi , which sometimes exhibits very soft spectra like ngc 55 and ngc 5408 ( the soft ultraluminous regime , sutton et al .",
    "unfortunately the interpretation of this feature in ngc 6946 x-1 was difficult due to its flux at 1 kev ( obs i d 0691570101 ) @xmath114% lower than ngc55 ulx .",
    "the presence of _ blueshifted _ emission lines in ngc 55 ulx suggests that we may be looking through a different line of sight compared to ngc 1313 and 5408 ulxs .",
    "the continuum is for instance significantly lower than ngc 5408 x-1 ( see extended data fig.4 in paperi ) , but at 1kev ngc 55 ulx is comparable if not brighter , with the emission lines at other energies also matching the flux of the lines in the other ulxs .",
    "remarkably , the line - emitting gas phases account for 1020% of the total source flux in the x - ray ( 0.210kev ) energy band in agreement with ngc5408 x-1 , while in ngc 1313 x-1 the lines contribute about 5% of the source flux .",
    "if the emission lines in these ulxs have the same origin then we should expect that ngc 55 ulx is seen through a preferential line of sight where the outflow velocity of the emission component is almost maximum ( see fig.[fig : geometry ] ) , while the other three ulxs may be seen through a line of sight where the motion of the line - emitting gas is more tangential .",
    "this would explain why the emission lines in ngc 5408 x-1 appear to be broader by an order of magnitude ( @xmath115 km s@xmath28 , see paperi ) .",
    "ngc 1313 x-1 shows a large range of spectral hardness with strong absorption features at @xmath5 , which suggests moderate inclination angles with the wind variability possibly due to precession ( see middleton et al .",
    "holmberg ix x-1 shows very shallow residuals in epic spectra and a spectral hardness among the highest measured in ulxs which argues in favour of a nearly face on view ( e.g. sutton et al . 2013 , middleton et al .",

    "the dashed lines indicated some possible sightlines for some famous ulxs and for the uls regime ( see e.g. urquhart and soria 2016 ) .",
    "we believe that the line of sight of ngc 55 ulx is somewhere between the classical ulx and uls sources , but still at high inclination where outflowing material is both emitting and absorbing photons from the inner regions . ]      a comprehensive analysis of the ulx phenomenology also needs high - resolution spectroscopy of ulss in order to study the cases of extreme absorption and to ultimately confirm an unification scenario for ulxs and ulss ( see fig.[fig : geometry ] and , e.g. , poutanen et al .",
    "2007 , urquhart and soria 2016 , and references therein ) .",
    "the uls archive has xmm-_newton _ exposures that are just too short ( @xmath116ks ) to provide rgs spectra with statistics good enough to significantly detect sharp spectral features .",
    "ngc 247 ulx is likely the best candidate among all ulss because of its brightness , good isolation , and sharp drop at 1kev ( see e.g. urquhart and soria 2016 , feng et al .",
    "the rgs archive has two on - axis exposures with a modest 30ks exposure time each .",
    "these prevent us from doing an accurate analysis , which would require more data or additional spectra of other ulss and , therefore , we defer this work to a dedicated forthcoming paper .      ideally , we would need a statistical sample to probe the scenario shown in fig.[fig : geometry ] comparing the properties of the wind in sources at different angles of inclination to the observer and mass accretion rate . only a handful of sources have been observed with deep , on - axis , xmm-_newton _ observations with statistics good enough to enable rgs analysis and no on - axis full - orbit observation of any bright uls has ever been taken .",
    "the fact that the wind lines can be studied imply that with a long exposure of a uls we will learn more about their physics . deeper observations of other ulxs and ulss will provide a complete sample of ultrafast winds , while deeper observations of those sources which already have well - exposed rgs spectra ( e.g. ngc 1313 x-1 and ngc 55 ulx ) will enable to study the wind in detail and its dependence on flux , spectral hardness , and source quasi - periodicities ( e.g. walton et al .",
    "all this is crucial to understand the relation between the wind and both the accretion rate and the viewing angle , which is useful to understand the launching mechanism .",
    "this research field is still rather new and the esa s xmm-_newton _ satellite has unique capabilities to further develop it .",
    "the gratings on board nasa s _ chandra _ satellite ( hetgs / letgs , e.g. brinkman et al .",
    "2000 and canizares et al .",
    "2005 ) have the highest spectral resolution available in the x - ray band , but their effective area is smaller than that of rgs in the soft x - ray band where most ulx wind features are shown and where the flux is highest .",
    "hetgs and letgs are clearly optimal to distinguish spectral features in the brightest objects , whilst the rgs has unique capabilities to detect lines in weak objects , which means that the continuation of the xmm-_newton _ and chandra missions is crucial to study the ulxs and ulss in detail .",
    "ulxs and ulss will be excellent targets for a @xmath117 replacement mission , for the proposed @xmath118 gratings mission and , particularly , for the two - square - meter esa s @xmath119 mission .",
    "@xmath118 can significantly improve the rgs results due its much higher spectral resolution in the soft x - ray energy band ( e.g. , kaastra 2016 ) .",
    "@xmath117 has already proven that we can change the way we perform x - ray spectroscopy thanks to its combination of excellent spectral resolution and collective area in the high energy x - ray band ( hitomi collaboration 2016 ) .",
    "@xmath119 will completely revolutionize x - ray astronomy due to its combination of high spatial and spectral resolution ( nandra et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "we remark that the study of the accretion flow in ulxs and ulss is important to understand the phenomenology of super - eddington accretion , which may be required to occur during the early stages of the universe to build up the supermassive black holes that have been discovered to power agn at high redshifts ( see e.g. volonteri et al .",
    "in the last decade it has been proposed that a substantial fraction of the population of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) and ultraluminous supersoft sources ( ulss ) are powered by super - eddington accretion onto compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes ( see , e.g. , king et al .",
    "2001 , roberts 2007 , urquhart and soria 2016 , feng et al .",
    "2016 , and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , ulss could be a category of ulxs observed at high inclination angles , possibly edge on , where a thick layer of material is obscuring the innermost hard x - ray emitting regions ( e.g. , kylafis & xilouris 1993 and poutanen et al .",
    "we have studied the ngc 55 ulx which we believe is a hybrid source showing properties common to both ulx and uls .",
    "the presence of a spectral curvature at 1kev and a high energy tail that can be described as a @xmath120kev disk - like blackbody place it just in between these two categories of x - ray sources .    we have found a powerful wind characterized by emission and absorption lines blueshifted by significant fractions of the speed of light ( @xmath121 ) in the xmm-_newton_/rgs spectrum of ngc 55 ulx .",
    "the detection of such a wind is consistent with the predictions of super - eddington accretion ( takeuchi et al .",
    "the wind has a complex dynamical structure with an ionization state that increases with the outflow velocity , which indicates launching from different regions of the accretion disk .",
    "the comparison of the wind in ngc 55 ulx with that detected in other ulxs ( pinto et al .",
    "2016 ) suggests that the source is being observed at high inclinations , but not high enough to look exactly like a uls , in agreement with the classification on the basis of its spectral shape ( e.g. , sutton et al .",
    "however , the strongest wind component partly absorbs the source flux below 1kev , generating a drop similar to that observed in ulss .",
    "the long and short term spectral variability of the source shows a softening of the spectrum at lower luminosities , i.e. around the eddington luminosity ( for a @xmath122 black hole ) , which agrees with the proposed scenario of wind clumps crossing the line of sight and partly obscuring the innermost region where most hard x - rays come from ( e.g. middleton et al .",
    "2015a , and references therein ) .",
    "we have found evidence for a long @xmath11000s soft lag at low frequencies , similar to ngc 5408 x-1 ( hernandez - garcia et al .",
    "2015 ) , which may indicate that part of the emission coming from the inner regions has been reprocessed in the outer regions before being re - emitted towards the observer .",
    "this provides further support to the wind scenario .",
    "deeper xmm-_newton _ observations of ngc 55 ulx and other ulxs and ulss will enable a detailed study of the dependence of the wind on the accretion rate and the inclination angle , which can help us to understand the geometry and the accretion flow in these extraordinary astronomical objects and in super - eddington accretors in general .",

    "in this section we briefly discuss some systematic effects that might have limited our analysis , such as the contamination from the background ( instrumental and/or astrophysical ) as well as the approximation of the ionization balance .",
    "we also provide some more technical detail on the selection of flux intervals used to extract flux - resolved spectra and the plots of the power density spectra .",
    "all this was shifted here to speed up the paper reading .",
    "ulxs are faint sources if compared to common nearby galactic x - ray binaries or active galactic nuclei .",
    "the epic - pn camera has a very large effective area , which provides a lot of counts and an energy band broad enough to constrain the spectral continuum of ulxs .",
    "rgs spectrometers distribute the photons in much more energy bins and therefore are much less sensitive . searching for weak features in their spectra must therefore be a careful process , particularly when accounting for the background .",
    "luckily , we have two ways of extracting an rgs background spectrum .",
    "the first method uses the photons outside a certain cross - dispersion slit , which according to the standard xmm-_newton_/sas routine is the 98% of the psf ( see fig.[fig : rgs_background ] , middle panel ) .",
    "another method uses a model background estimated with ultradeep exposures of blank fields and scaled by the count rate in the rgs ccd 9 where hardly any emission from the source is expected ( see fig.[fig : rgs_background ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "the two background spectra are very similar and significantly dominate below @xmath17 and above @xmath126 .",
    "the rgs1 and 2 raw source spectra ( and the spectral features ) are significantly stronger than the background in our wavelength range . for the work presented in this paper we have used the background determined from the exposure ,",
    "but we have repeated all the work using the model background and found no significant change in our results .",
    "all this shows that the background has minor systematic effects in our analysis .",
    "another source of systematic uncertainties is the choice of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) since it may affect the ionization balance and therefore the calculation of ionization parameters and column densities in the photoionization components ( both in emission and absorption ) .",
    "for instance , the standard @xmath48 model in spex adopts a seyfert 1 type of sed and ionization balance , whose shape of course deviates from the soft sed of a ulx such as ngc 55 ulx . to understand the effects of the sed choice",
    ", we test the photoionization @xmath125 model in spex , which assumes the sed measured with the fitted spectral continuum model - the observed spectral shape of ngc 55 ulx - and instantaneously calculates the photoionization equilibrium using the plasma routines available in spex ( see the spex manual for more detail ) . at the moment",
    "the @xmath125 emission model calculates the thermal emission of the photoionized layer by ignoring the photon - induced processes .",
    "this is not realistic enough , so for the moment we only check the effects of the sed on the absorption component .",
    "we have fitted again the rgs spectrum of ngc 55 ulx with the epic spectral continuum on top of which we have added a @xmath125 model to substitute the @xmath48 component of the @xmath57 absorber detected with highest significance .",
    "the main result is shown in table[table : xabs_pion_comparison ] along with the improvement in the fits previously obtained with the @xmath48 model ( see also table[table : improvements ] ) .",
    "the results with the @xmath48 and the @xmath125 models are consistent within the statistical uncertainties mainly due to the limited statistics . however , there is no indication of major systematics apart from the fact that the @xmath125 model has larger uncertainties due to the larger dependence of the parameters on the continuum shape .",
    "the @xmath125 model certainly provides a more physical description of the absorber(s ) , but it requires much more memory and cpu time than the @xmath48 model , of course .",
    "the search for a multiple / continuous photoionization structure of the wind would have been prohibitive with as many @xmath125 components as the @xmath48 components used in sect.[sec : complex_wind_model ] and fig.[fig : wind_structure_idl ] .",
    "rgs fits improvements and details with of two alternative photoionized absorbers that use a default ( @xmath48 ) and a measured ( @xmath125 ) ionization balance .",

    "epic_flux_resolved_spectra ] we extracted epic spectra in different flux ranges in order to understand the dependence of its spectral shape with the luminosity . here",
    "we briefly describe the selection of the flux intervals .    at first , we extracted an epic / pn lightcurve in the 0.310kev energy band for both the first ( id=0028740201 ) and the second exposure ( id=0655050101 ) . the source and",

    "this provided two slices with 27 thousand counts each .",
    "the second observation was instead split into three intervals of fluxes between ( @xmath128 ) , ( 0.8550.980 ) , and ( @xmath129 ) counts / s .",
    "this provided three slices with about 32 thousand counts each .",
    "the statistics of these five time intervals are comparable .",
    "the five time intervals can be also seen in fig.[fig : lightcurves_flux_resolved ] .",
    "we built the good time intervals using these intervals and extracted source and background spectra , response matrices , and effective area auxiliary files with the _ evselect _ task .",
    "the flux - resolved spectra have been shown in fig.[fig : epic_flux_resolved_spectra ] .",

    "the resulting power density spectra are shown in fig.[fig : pds ] .",
