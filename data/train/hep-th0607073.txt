    "i first give a quick review of the fundamentals of statistical mechanics that we need later .",
    "for any thermodynamical system there are two almost identical statistical descriptions .",

    "thus = ( e ) ( ) _ v = ( ) _ v , p t ( ) _ e = t ( ) _ e , and c_v ( ) _ v = -^2 ( ) _ v = - ^-1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ canonical ensemble _ can be used to describe the properties of any large subsystem of a closed system , providing the energy is an extensive variable .",
    "the basic quantity in this ensemble is the canonical partition function @xmath71 which is the laplace transformation of the total energy density @xmath64 for any system whose energy is bounded from below ( say , unlike the gravitating system ) , z ( ) = _ 0^d e e^-e ( e),[laplace ] or inversely , if @xmath72 exists and is known as a function of @xmath17 then @xmath64 can be obtained as a function of @xmath43 from the inverse laplace transformation , ( e ) = _ l - i^l + i e^e z ( ) , [ inverse_laplace ] where @xmath73 is the contour which is chosen to be right of all the singularities of @xmath72 in the complex @xmath17 plane .    note that while ( [ inverse_laplace ] ) always exists , the transformation ( [ laplace ] ) is subject to the existence of the saddle point .",
    "both canonical and microcanonical descriptions of statistical mechanics can be used in an interchangeable manner for describing the gaseous systems .",
    "while for a system that is described by microcanonical distribution , the total energy @xmath43 is fixed , the canonical distribution describes the same system in a way that the total energy is not a fixed quantity but rather fluctuates among the canonical ensemble .",
    "if we should be able to use either of the two descriptions , in an interchangeable manner , then to describe the system one must satisfies the following two conditions : ( a ) the mean energy @xmath74 of the canonical ensemble must be the same as the fixed energy of the microcanonical ensemble and ( b ) the root - mean - square fluctuations in the energy , in the canonical distribution , @xmath75 , must be negligible for sufficiently large systems , i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "since in the canonical distribution , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , where the primes denote the differentiation with respect to @xmath17 , it follows that c_v & = & ^2 ( e^2 - e ^2 ) = ^2 ( - ) + & = & ^2 ( ) = - ^2 .",
    "the specific heat defined in the canonical distribution must , therefore , be positive definite .",
    "as long as the two distributions are equivalent the specific heat in microcanonical description will be positive definite .",
    "there are regimes in which the specific heat in microcanonical distribution is negative and thus the equivalence between the two prescriptions breaks down .",
    "one example of this situation is near the phase transition , where the fluctuations may become very large .",
    "when the string coupling is sufficiently small , @xmath48 , and the local spacetime geometry is close to flat @xmath79 over the length scale of the finite size box of volume @xmath80 , there are two distinct regimes that characterizes the statistical mechanics of string thermodynamics : the massless modes with field theoretic entropy , @xmath81 , and the highly excited strings with @xmath82 .",
    "one simple realization of this setup for a string background is a spatial toroidal compactification with @xmath1 dimensions of size @xmath83 and @xmath19 dimensions of string scale size .",
    "small string coupling ensures us that we can measure energies with respect to the flat time coordinate .    to review the features of string thermodynamics we use the intuitive geometrical picture for a highly excited string as a random walk in target space @xcite .",
    "the large entropy factor corresponding to the shape of the random walk in space explains why highly energetic strings dominate the thermodynamics despite of their large energy .",
    "* closed strings . * for a highly excited closed string represented as a random walk in a target space , the energy @xmath84 of the string is proportional to the length of the random walk .",
    "thus the number of the strings with a fixed starting point grows as @xmath85 , with @xmath86 being the hagedorn temperature .",
    "this explains the bulk of the entropy of highly energetic strings .",
    "closed strings correspond to random walks that must close on themselves .",
    "this overcounts by a factor of roughly the volume of the walk , denoted @xmath87 .",
    "the global translation of the random walk in volume @xmath80 and @xmath88 due the fact that any point in the string can be considered as a new starting point are other factors that contribute to the number of closed string .",
    "therefore , the final result is _ ( ) ~v . .",
    "there are two limiting case here : + * ( a ) * volume of the random walk is well - contained in @xmath1 spatial dimensions ( i.e. , @xmath89 ) which corresponds to a string in @xmath1 non - compact dimensions . in this case",

    "in order to compute the power spectrum of these fluctuations , we will use the theory of linear cosmological perturbations around a four - dimensional homogeneous and isotropic cosmology @xcite .",
    "the key point here is the fact that the thermal fluctuations generated during the hagedorn phase are well inside the hubble radius and exit the hubble radius at a time very close to the transition time from hagedorn era to the radiation phase .",
    "these fluctuations then will reenter the hubble radius at some later time well within radiation dominated epoch .    in the absence of anisotropic stress , there is only one physical degree of freedom , namely the relativistic generalization of the newtonian gravitational potential . in a flat universe in the conformal newtonian gauge , the metric takes the form ds^2 = - ( 1 + 2 ) dt^2 + a(t)^2 ( 1 - 2 ) d*x*^2 , [ pert_metric ] where @xmath208 is physical time , @xmath209 are the comoving spatial coordinates of the three large spatial dimensions , @xmath210 is the cosmological scale factor and @xmath211 represents the scalar fluctuation mode in the gravitational potential .",
    "here we discount the tensor modes ( see @xcite for the discussion of the tensor modes in the hagedorn phase ) .",
    "for the metric ( [ pert_metric ] ) with small perturbations , the einstein and energy - momentum tensor can be split to unperturbed and linear terms in fluctuations .",
    "the linearized equations for the perturbations are g^_= _",
    "d+1 ^ 2 t^ _ , where @xmath212 is the einstein gravitational coupling constant in an arbitrary spatial dimension @xmath1",
    "@xcite @xmath213     and is followed by the radiation - dominated phase of standard cosmology .",
    "the solid curve represents the hubble radius @xmath200 which is cosmological and almost constant during the quasi - static hagedorn phase , shrinks abruptly to a microphysical scale at @xmath214 and then increases linearly in time for @xmath215 .",
    "fixed comoving scales ( labeled by @xmath216 and @xmath217 ) which are currently probed in cosmological observations have wavelengths which are smaller than the hubble radius during the hagedorn phase .",
    "they exit the radius at times @xmath218 just prior to @xmath214 , and propagate with a wavelength larger than the hubble radius until they reenter the hubble radius at times @xmath219.,height=377 ]    the short - wavelength perturbations are very important as they are the reason for the acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum . on scales smaller than the hubble radius",
    ", the gravitational potential @xmath220 is determined by the matter fluctuations via the einstein constraint equation ( @xmath221 ) which is the relativistic generalization of the poisson equation of newtonian gravitational perturbation theory : ^2 = , [ poisson_real ] where @xmath222 is the newton s gravitational coupling constant in @xmath1 compact but yet large spatial dimensions and @xmath223 \\equiv ( x -1)!$ ] .",
    "using fourier transform of ( [ poisson_real ] ) we find that at the hubble radius crossing time |_k|^2 = k^-4 ^2_k [ poisson_k ] . by ( [ poisson_k ] )",
    "one can calculate the power spectrum of the metric fluctuations @xmath224 at the end of the hagedorn phase or to be more precise , at the time @xmath218 when the fluctuate mode labeled by @xmath225 exits the hubble radius ( see figure [ fig:3 ] ) . in the context of standard cosmological perturbation theory , for modes with @xmath226 , one can find a conserved quantity @xmath227 which is related to the spatial curvature in comoving slicing of spacetime and in newtonian gauge ( in the absence of anisotropic pressure ) is given by @xcite = + ( ) , where = - + = - + is the spatial curvature on the constant energy density spacelike surface and @xmath228 is the equation of state .",
    "note that for the super - hubble radius fluctuations , i.e. , in the limit of @xmath229 , @xmath230 .",
    "the conservation of @xmath227 ( or @xmath231 ) means conservation of @xmath220 on super - hubble scale as far as the equation of state of the background does not change drastically from one phase to another one . for string gas cosmology the equation of state at the end of the hagedorn phase changes from @xmath232 to @xmath233 at the beginning of the radiation dominated era which is much milder than a change compare to the cosmic inflationary scenario .",
    "as long as the equations of four space - time dimensional general relativistic cosmological perturbation theory apply , then @xmath220 is conserved on super - hubble scales as long as the equation of state of the background does not change significantly .",
    "the use of ordinary general relativistic cosmological perturbation theory is certainly justified after the end of the hagedorn phase , but not necessarily in the time interval between mode exiting from the hagedorn phase and radiation dominated epoch .    assuming the validity of the arguments of the previous paragraphs by ignoring the contribution of the dilation fluctuation , then the scalar spectral index @xmath234 of the cosmological perturbations can be determined .",
    "the dimensionless power spectrum , in @xmath1 spatial dimensions is given by @xcite ^2(k ) = k^d p(k ) , where @xmath235 and @xmath236 are the power spectra of the energy density fluctuations and the metric perturbation , respectively .",
    "thus the dimensionless power spectrum of the metric fluctuation is ^2__k(k ) = k^-4 ^2__k(k ) , which has the following forms at the end of hagedorn regime ^2__k_cl(k ) k^2(d - 3 ) [ closed_power ] , for closed strings and ^2__k_op(k ) k^d - 4 [ open_power ] , for open strings .    obviously ,",
    "as one can see from ( [ closed_power ] ) and ( [ open_power ] ) , the power spectrum is independent of the length of fluctuations in @xmath190 and @xmath237 for closed and open strings , respectively .",
    "therefore , whereas only closed strings provide us a scale - invariant spectrum in @xmath238 dimensions , ^2__k_cl(k ) [ scale_inv ] , the spectrum of open strings in @xmath190 slopes towards red ( more power on large scales ) ^2__k_cl(k ) [ scale_red ] . note that ( [ scale_inv ] ) near the hagedorn temperature @xmath239 corresponds to a hierarchy of @xmath240 for an observed amplitude of @xmath241 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio @xmath0 is proportional to the string coupling constant , @xmath242 .",
    "our assumption from the beginning was that @xmath243 .",
    "it seems that our result is consistent with that assumption .",
    "finally , notice that the spectrum ( [ scale_inv ] ) looks scale - invariant to the first approximation ( assuming @xmath67 is independent of @xmath225 ) , but since @xmath244 at time @xmath245 depends on @xmath225 , the power spectrum gains a slight _ red tilt _ due to the @xmath246 in the denominator .",
    "since the exact form of @xmath225 dependency of @xmath67 is hard to find due to our lack of knowledge about phase transition at the end of hagedorn epoch , one possible ansatz for the factor in the denominator , noticing that @xmath244 is a slowly decreasing function of @xmath225 ( shorter modes or larger @xmath225 modes exit hubble radius later ) , is 1 - ( ) ^ , where both @xmath100 and @xmath247 are positive numbers much smaller than unity for some constant @xmath248 . therefore the scaler spectral index @xmath234 is n_s - 1 - , which yields @xmath249 if we assume @xmath250 to be compatible with the third year wmap result @xcite .",
    "so the spectrum has a mild red tilt depending on the value of @xmath247 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the generation and evolution of cosmological fluctuations in a model of string gas cosmology in which an early quasi - static hagedorn phase is followed by the radiation - dominated phase of standard cosmology , without an intervening period of inflation . due to the fact that the hubble radius during the hagedorn phase is cosmological , it is possible to produce fluctuations using causal physics .",
    "assuming thermal equilibrium on scales smaller than the hubble radius , we have used string thermodynamics to study the amplitude of density fluctuations during the hagedorn phase .",
    "the mean square energy fluctuations are determined by the specific heat of the string gas . to compute the perturbations on a physical length scale @xmath83",
    ", we apply string thermodynamics to a box of size @xmath83 .",
    "working under the assumption that all spatial dimensions are compact ( but sufficiently large ) , the specific heat turns out to scale as @xmath189 for closed strings .",
    "this is an intrinsically stringy effect : in the case of point particle thermodynamics , the specific heat would scale as @xmath93 .",
    "the @xmath189 scaling of the specific heat leads to a scale - invariant spectrum of metric fluctuations .",
    "the compactness of the spatial dimensions are very crucial here .",
    "if we were dealing with noncompact dimensions , instead , the specific heat would have been negative .",
    "the positiveness of the specific heat for closed strings in compact spatial dimensions , among other things , can assure us the absence of formation of any primordial black holes in the hagedorn phase , for instance .",
    "although our cosmological scenario provides a new mechanism for generating a scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations , it does not solve all of the problems which inflation solves .",
    "in particular , it does not solve the flatness problem . without assuming that the there are some large spatial dimensions are much larger than the string scale ,",
    "we do not obtain a universe which is sufficiently large today .",
    "the longevity of the hagedorn phase , however , could help us to explain the homogeneity and the absence of @xmath9 monopoles . during the hagedorn phase",
    ", closed strings would have enough time to travel the entire universe and communicate with strings of other parts of the universe so that the whole universe becomes almost homogenous . on the other hand ,",
    "if monopoles form during the hagedorn phase , perhaps there would be enough time for them to annihilate each other .",
    "these issues , of course , need more detailed studies and will be discussed in future publications",
    ".    our scenario may well be testable observationally .",
    "taking into account the fact that the temperature @xmath67 evaluated at the time @xmath218 when the scale @xmath225 exits the hubble radius depends slightly on @xmath225 , the formula ( [ scale_inv ] ) leads to a calculable deviation of the spectrum from exact scale - invariance .",
    "since @xmath251 is decreasing as @xmath225 increases , a slightly red spectrum is predicted .",
    "since the equation of state does not change by orders of magnitude during the transition between the initial phase and the radiation - dominated phase as it does in inflationary cosmology , the spectrum of tensor modes is not expected to be suppressed compared to that of scalar modes .",
    "finally , it would interesting to study the fluctuation of the dilatonic field and its contribution to the metric fluctuation during the hagedorn phase in more details .",
    "we hope we can address this and other related issued in future publications .",

    "<S> going backwards in time , the universe contracts and the temperature grows . </S>",
    "<S> however , the temperature will not exceed the hagedorn temperature for weakly interacting closed strings . as the radius of space approaches the self - dual radius ( the string length ) </S>",
    "<S> , the pressure of the string gas will almost vanishes because of t - duality ( the positive contribution to the pressure from momentum modes will cancel against the negative pressure from string winding modes ) . using the background equations of motion from dilaton gravity , it follows that the evolution of the scale factor near the self - dual radius will be quasi - static @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> once the radius of space decreases below the self - dual radius , the string gas temperature will decrease , demonstrating that string gas cosmology will be non - singular . </S>",
