    "charm mixing remains elusive . in the standard model the charm mixing rate",
    "is greatly suppressed by small ckm matrix elements and strong gim suppression .",
    "this very fact , however , provides a unique opportunity to search for new physics .",
    "the search for charm mixing requires tagging the flavor of a neutral charm meson at production and again tagging the flavor at decay .",
    "the production flavor is determined using @xmath3 decays .",
    "the decay flavor is determined by reconstructing a cabibbo favored ( cf ) decay with a charged kaon such as @xmath4 . a right - sign ( rs ) decay",
    "is defined as one in which the kaon and soft pion charges are opposite while same kaon and @xmath5 charges are wrong - sign ( ws ) decays .",
    "the @xmath6 can also decay directly to @xmath7 via a doubly cabibbo suppressed decay ( dcsd ) . the time dependent ws decay rate can be written as : + @xmath8 where the three terms correspond to dcsd , interference between mixing and dcsd , and mixing .",
    "@xmath9 is the dcs branching ratio relative to the cabibbo favored mode .",
    "the paramters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are rotated versions of the mixing parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( mass and lifetime splitting terms ) and @xmath14 is the strong phase between cf and dcs decay .",
    "discovery of hadronic charm mixing requires separating the three components of eq .",
    "[ eq : wsrate ] using the different lifetime distributions .",
    "note that eq .",
    "[ eq : wsrate ] has no information on the sign of @xmath15 and therefore the relevent fit variable is @xmath16 . in this analysis , _ cp _ violation effects",
    "are not considered and charge conjugates are implied .",
    "focus recorded data during the 19967 fixed - target run at fermilab .",
    "a photon beam impinged on beo targets .",
    "16 silicon strip planes provide vertexing and tracking .",
    "charged particles are tracked and momentum analyzed as they pass through up to two dipole magnets and up to five sets of multiwire proportional chambers .",
    "three erenkov counters , two em calorimeters , and two muon detectors identify particles .",
    "a candidate driven vertexing algorithm is used to reconstruct charm . for @xmath4",
    ", two tracks must verticize with cl @xmath17 2% .",
    "this candidate is used to seed the production vertex which must have cl @xmath17 1% .",
    "the soft pion @xmath18 from the @xmath3 must be consistent with originating from the production vertex and the track is refit to the production vertex . separating charm from hadronic background",
    "is primarily accomplished by requiring the decay vertex be distinct from the production vertex .",
    "other cuts are made to ensure the vertex is isolated and is more charm like than background like .",
    "strong erenkov cuts are applied to the combination of @xmath19 and @xmath20 especially if the invariant mass under a reflection of @xmath21 and @xmath22 is close to the @xmath6 mass . if more than one @xmath23 candidate is found for one @xmath6 candidate an additional cut may be made .",
    "if a rs ( ws ) candidate is found with @xmath24 then no ws ( rs ) candidates are allowed .",
    "a 3d binned maximum likelihood fit is used in this analysis .",
    "two dimensions , @xmath25 and @xmath26 separate signal from background while @xmath27 distringuishes dcsd , mixing , and intereference .",
    "the rs and ws data are fit simultaneously .",
    "the fit components generally have a shape determined by a monte carlo simulation and a yield which is free to float , some with weak constraints imposed .",
    "the components making up the fit which are modeled by the monte carlo are rs signal , ws signal ( dcsd , interference , and mixing ) , real @xmath4 decay with a fake soft pion .",
    "reflections to both rs and ws ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) , rs background ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) , and ws background ( double misidentification of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) .",
    "the remaining background is some combination of non - charm and poorly reconstructed charm events .",
    "this is modeled with functional forms in mass @xmath35 , energy release @xmath36 , and lifetime @xmath37 .",
    "penalty terms are added to ensure backgrounds are consistent with known branching ratios .",
    "the affected backgrounds are the @xmath6 decays to @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath33 , and @xmath32 which all appear in rs and ws .",
    "the background due to double misid of the rs signal is fixed based on the rs yield and relative efficiency .",
    "mini monte carlo tests of the fit were used to verify the accuracy of the reported fit errors and to check for possible biases in the fit .",
    "no significant bias was found and the reported fit errors agree with the mini monte carlo results .",
    "fit variants with different binning , different constraints , and different accounting of the random background were tried .",
    "no significant differences were observed .",
    "variations of all the selection criteria were also analyzed with no significant differences in the results .",
    "for the branching ratios reported , systematic errors due to fit variants and cut variants were obtained from the r.m.s of the variations and then added in quadrature .     and @xmath26 of the fit and data for ws events .",
