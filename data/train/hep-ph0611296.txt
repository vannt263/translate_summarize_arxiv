    "in bremsstrahlung in qed , the emission of a photon does not change the current for subsequent emissions .",
    "this implies that the photon multiplicity is described by a poisson distribution .",
    "as the gluons carry colour charge , the emission of a gluon in qcd changes the current relevant for the subsequent emissions .",
    "an initial hard gluon will radiate many softer gluons .",
    "this leads to a cascade with an exponential growth in multiplicity and to large fluctuations .",
    "the multiplicity distribution is approximately satisfying kno scaling , with a width which is proportional to the average multiplicity .",
    "this short review is divided in three parts :    a. multiplicity distribution for partons    b. effects of hadronization    c. fractal structures      in @xmath0-ann .",
    "the emission of a gluon from a @xmath3 pair is a _ coherent _ emission from e.g. a _ red _ and an _ anti - red _ colour charge .",
    "the result corresponds to a colour dipole with the following distribution ( in the leading log approximation ) : @xmath4 the phase space is a triangular region in @xmath5-space given by @xmath6 , and within this triangle the density is just given by @xmath7 .",
    "the emission of a second ( softer ) gluon is given by two dipoles , one between the quark and the first gluon , and one between this gluon and the antiquark .",
    "the phase space is enlarged compared to that for the first gluon , and corresponds to the folded surface shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasespace]a . for subsequent gluons the phase space",
    "is further increased , and corresponds to the fractal surface in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasespace]b .",
    "the phase space for gluon emission in @xmath0-ann . is a triangular region in the @xmath8-plane .",
    "the height of the triangle is given by @xmath9 .",
    "when one gluon is emitted at @xmath10 a second gluon with smaller @xmath11 can be emitted in the larger phase space shown in fig .",
    "further softer emissions give the fractal phase space in fig .",
    "( b).,width=302 ]    we let @xmath12 denote the distribution in the number , @xmath13 , of dipoles ( which neglecting @xmath3 pair creation is equal to the number of gluons plus one ) . the laplace transform @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 it is then relatively easy to derive the relation ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath16 expanding eq .",
    "( [ eq : mathcalp ] ) in a taylor series in @xmath17 gives @xmath18 inserted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolution ] ) this also implies the following equations for the average and the variance of the multiplicity distribution : @xmath19 the solutions to these equations are bessel functions , and for high energies we get @xmath20 we see that the width of the distribution is proportional to @xmath21 , in agreement with kno scaling , and thus for large @xmath13 the distribution is much wider than a poisson distribution .",
    "the anomalous dimension is given by a logarithmic derivative .",
    "note that in the literature one can find different definitions , where the derivative is taken with respect either to @xmath22 or to @xmath23 : @xmath24    i want here to add a few comments :    * @xmath21 depends on the resolution , i.e. on the cut - off for soft emissions .",
    "it is here essential to have a cut - off which is defined locally , and not fixed in e.g. the overall cms . in the dipole cascade model",
    "this is chosen as @xmath11 measured in the rest frame of the emitting dipole . *",
    "the running of @xmath25 is important . with a constant @xmath25",

    ".      in string fragmentation the average hadron multiplicity , @xmath29 , in a single @xmath3 system is proportional to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a scale of order 1gev .",
    "the variance of the fluctuations , @xmath32 , is proportional to @xmath29 , and the distribution is thus relatively more narrow for higher energies and larger @xmath29 . for a system of a @xmath3 pair and a number of gluons",
    "we get a set of string pieces with ( squared ) masses @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the momentum of parton @xmath35 and the partons are ordered in colour . for the average multiplicity",
    "we then get @xmath36 which just corresponds to the length of the baseline of the fractal surface in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasespace]b .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) the mass of a string piece should not be smaller than @xmath37 , as it otherwise would give a negative contribution .",
    "it is , however , also possible to define an infrared stable measure , called the @xmath38-measure , which is insensitive to the cut - off for the perturbative cascade @xcite .",
    "simulations show that a high energy even with little gluon radiation and an event at lower energy but more radiation give equally many hadrons if they have the same @xmath38-value .",
    "thus the multiplicity depends only on the measure @xmath38 , which corresponds to an `` effective string length '' . the probability density @xmath39 satisfies the same evolution equation ( [ eq : evolution ] ) as @xmath40 , only with different boundary conditions .",
    "this implies that the distribution in @xmath38 has the same high energy behaviour as the distribution in dipole multiplicity , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqn ] ) .",
    "the fluctuations in the hadron multiplicity get contributions from both the perturbative cascade and the soft hadronization , and we get approximately @xmath41 here the first term corresponds to the fluctuations in the cascade and the second one to those in the hadronization process . at high energy the first contribution dominates , while the second is larger at energies below 40 - 50 gev . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the total result satisfies kno scaling with @xmath42 , although this is not the case for any of the contributions separately below the top lep energy . at higher energies",

    "the length of this curve satisfies again the same evolution equation .",
    "the boundary conditions are different , and with the notations @xmath9 and @xmath45 the length will be proportional to the expression @xmath46 it is also possible to define a ( multi)fractal dimension for this curve @xmath47 ( it is called a multifractal as the dimension varies with the resolution @xmath48 . )    fluctuations in small phase space regions , e.g. slices in rapidity @xmath49 , can be described by the scaled moments @xmath50    if the total phase space is divided in @xmath51 equal pieces ( which gives @xmath52 ) a scaling behaviour @xmath53 is interpreted as an signal for _",

    "@xcite.,width=264 ]    as for the distributions in the full phase space , there are large corrections from non - leading effects and from hadronization .",
    "therefore the analytic results have had limited success in comparisons with experimental data . as examples figs .",
    "[ fig : intjetset ] and [ fig : intanalyt ] show results from the l3 collaboration at lep @xcite for factorial moments in regions separated by cones with opening angels @xmath60 and @xmath61 around a jet axis .",

    "[ fig : intanalyt ] ) .",
    "we note that different nll calculations give quite different results .",
    "these calculations have different approximations for nnll contributions , which shows that the higher order corrections can not be neglected .",
    "( it was early realised that be correlations give an important contribution to the multiplicity moments , and in the l3 analysis this effect is removed from the data . )",
    "it is also possible to define the @xmath38-measure for a hadronic state instead of a parton state , and it appears that analytic results for the @xmath38-measure are closer to the corresponding mc - results @xcite .",
    "no comparisons with experimental data have been presented until now for such an analysis .",
    "the gluon self coupling implies a fast growth of multiplicity and large fluctuations . in lla we get the following asymptotic results :",
    "@xmath64    the qcd cascade has a fractal structure .",
    "the multiplicity in small phase space intervals shows intermittent features with a multifractal ( renyi ) dimension @xmath65 , and the curve with the @xmath38-measure has the dimension @xmath66 .    however , energy - momentum conservation and other non - leading effects are very important .",
    "nll calculations give very different results if they differ at nnll order .",
    "hard emissions are the most important , but matrix elements factorize only for soft emissions . therefore analytic calculations have in many cases met limited success .",
    "mc programs work , however , generally quite well .",
    "fermion correlation functions are usually fitted to the form @xmath67 the quantity @xmath68 is here interpreted as the radius of the production region for the particle pair .",
    "the different lep experiments have measured momentum correlations between @xmath2 and/or @xmath69 pairs , and obtained production radii around @xmath70 , which is much smaller than the proton radius @xcite .    in experiments",
    "the correlation function @xmath71 is determined by comparing the observed number of pairs , @xmath72 , with a reference sample , @xmath73 : @xmath74 the important question is how to construct the reference sample .",
    "different methods have been applied :      a common method to reduce the problems is to take a _",
    "double ratio _ : @xmath75 here the sample of monte carlo events , @xmath76 , should be generated without including fd correlations in the model .",
    "it is argued that the effect of different event types should be similar in the real data and the mc events , and therefore be reduced in the ratio .",
    "the mixed pairs depend only on inclusive spectra , and the mc programs are tuned to reproduce the inclusive spectra with good precision .",
    "this implies that the tuning also gives @xmath77 which implies that @xmath78 consequently the result _ depends very critically on a realistic mc _ , also if the double ratio is used in the analysis .    in the lund string hadronization model the colour string normally breaks by @xmath3 pair production .",
    "the ordering of the hadrons along the string , the rank ordering , agrees on average with the ordering in rapidity , with an average separation , @xmath49 , of the order of half a unit in rapidity .",
    "a baryon - antibaryon pair can be produced when a breakup is generated by a diquark - antidiquark pair , with quark - antiquark pairs on either side . in this picture",
    "two baryons must always be separated by at least one antibaryon ( and normally also with one or more mesons ) . this will give a strong anti - correlation between two baryons in rapidity and in momentum .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp - par ] , which shows correlations in @xmath1 and @xmath79 pairs .",
    "we see that there is a positive correlation between protons and antiprotons , which are neighbours in rank , but a negative correlation between two protons .      in the model",
    "there is also a correlation between momentum and space coordinates for the produced hadrons .",
    "thus two identical baryons are ( in the model ) well separated also in coordinate space , and we would from this picture expect fermi - dirac correlations to correspond to a radius @xmath82 fm .",
    "we see that the range for the @xmath1 correlation in fig .  [",
    "fig : pp - par ] is given by @xmath83 .",
    "we note that this corresponds exactly to the correlation length reported in the experiments , although in this model the production radius is very much larger .",
    "the strength of the correlation is , however , smaller in the mc than in the data .",
    "\\1 ) there are two fundamental parameters , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , in the lund model `` splitting function '' @xmath86 the hadron multiplicity depends essentially on the ratio @xmath87 , this ratio is therefore well determined by experiments , but @xmath84 and @xmath85 separately are more uncertain .",
    "small values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 correspond to a wide distribution @xmath88 , and a wide distribution in the separation , @xmath49 , between hadrons which are neighbours in rank .",
    "large values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 imply a narrow @xmath49- distribution and therefore lower probability for two particles to be close in momentum space .",
    "the effect of varying @xmath84 and @xmath85 keeping the multiplicity unchanged is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : abdep ] .",
    "a single jet _ without _ a junction has a large dip in @xmath89 for small @xmath91 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "this correlation is reduced by the approximate treatment in the mc of the small mass systems close to the `` junction '' ( + ) . ]",
    "\\3 ) the mc does not exactly reproduce the lund hadronization model .",
    "the splitting function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f(z ) ] ) gives a correct result when the remaining energy in the system is large .",
    "to minimise the error at the end of the cascade , when the energy is small , the mc cuts off hadrons from both ends randomly , and joins the two ends when the remaining mass is small .",
    "this works well for inclusive distributions , but implies that the correlations do not correspond to the model prediction for particles close to the `` junction '' .",
    "[ fig : junc ] shows results for a single jet without a junction compared with the standard result .",
    "\\5 ) pion correlations are not perfectly reproduced by the mc . as an example the delphi antiproton sample contains 15% pions .",
    "[ fig : pion ] shows results with and without a 15% pion admixture .",
    "we see that an error in the simulation of the pion - pion or pion - proton correlations also affects the estimated proton - proton correlations .    in summary",
    "we see that there are many effects which make the mc predictions for @xmath1 or @xmath2 correlations quite uncertain . as the experimental determination of the correlations rely so strongly on a correct mc , it is therfore at present premature to conclude that the production radius has the very small value around 0.15fm .",
    "@xmath93 particles reveal their spin in the orientation of their decay products .",
    "this has been used to study @xmath2 correlations without the need for a comparison with mc results .",
    "a @xmath2 pair with total spin 1 must have an antisymmetric spacial wave function and is therefore expected to show a suppression for small relative momenta @xmath91 . @xmath2 pairs with total spin 0 has a symmetric spacial wave function , and should therefore show an enhancement for small @xmath91 , similar to the correlation for bosons .",
    "therefore one expects pairs with small @xmath91-values to be dominantly @xmath94 .",
    "analyses at lep @xcite do indicate such an effect .",
    "they are however based on rather low statistics , and the errors are presently too large for any definite conclusion about the strength and range of the effect .",
