    "<S> three different cases of magnetic field reentrant ground states in heavy fermion systems , urhge , uge@xmath0 and cerhin@xmath1 recently studied in grenoble , are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> urhge is a ferromagnetic superconductor with reentrace of superconductivity under magnetic field ( @xmath2 ) which is associated to the spin reorientation field . </S>",
    "<S> uge@xmath0 is a ferromagnetic superconductor with an enhancement of the upper critical field @xmath3 of superconductivity at its metamagnetic transition between 2 ferromagnetic phases . </S>",
    "<S> cerhin@xmath1 is a superconductor with @xmath2 reentrant antiferromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the links between the @xmath2 enhancement of the different contributions to the effective mass and the field reentrant phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the unconventional superconductivity ( sc ) of heavy fermion compounds often occurs close to quantum singularities driven by magnetic or valence instabilities . here </S>",
    "<S> we will present three cases of field reentrant phenomena linked to the interplay between field changes of their magnetic and superconducting properties .    </S>",
    "<S> urhge is a very nice example of ferromagnetic ( fm ) superconductor ; i.e. i ) its critical superconducting transition temperature @xmath40.27  k is far below its curie temperature @xmath5 9.5  k @xcite , ii ) applying a pressure drives the system deeper in the fm domain as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ urhge](a ) @xcite ; thus , one escapes from a fm quantum singularity where @xmath6 ; iii ) at @xmath7 , the fermi surface is well formed and thus the fermi liquid regime as @xmath8 resistivity law is also well established ; iv ) furthermore , the rather weak magnetic anisotropy leads to the remarked phenomena that the sublattice magnetization @xmath9 changes its alignment from the initial @xmath10-axis to the @xmath11-axis at @xmath1212  t along one of the hard axis ( the @xmath11-axis ) without any drastic change of @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the surprising result is that when @xmath2 increases along the @xmath11-axis , the reentrant superconductivity ( rsc ) is observed in a rather large @xmath2 window sticked to @xmath14 @xcite . by a careful study of the resistivity under pressure and magnetic field , we have recently demonstrated that the sc properties can be well understood via a mcmillan type formula , @xmath15 , where the effective mass @xmath16 is the sum of a renormalized band mass @xmath17 and of a correlated mass @xmath18 source of the sc pairing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> field enhancement of @xmath19 will occur in the vicinity of @xmath14 , while @xmath17 appears as field and pressure invariant . under pressure , @xmath20 decreases thus @xmath21 and the upper critical field ( @xmath22 decrease slowly . </S>",
    "<S> the rsc is strongly affected by the concomitant decrease of @xmath23 and of @xmath24 . as predicted by our simple model , </S>",
    "<S> the rsc collapses at a pressure @xmath25  1.5  gpa far lower than the pressure @xmath26 where the low field sc will disappear , i.e. @xmath20 will collapse . </S>",
    "<S> the low field sc seems to disappear only near 4  gpa ( fig .  [ urhge](b ) ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) ( @xmath27 ) phase diagram of urhge at @xmath28  t. ( b ) pressure dependence of @xmath29 at @xmath28  t ( circle ) and @xmath14 ( square ) . ]    in uge@xmath0 , the sc dome is not linked to the proximity of the fm quantum singularity where fm will disappear but to the first order singularity at @xmath30 1.3  gpa where the system switches from a low pressure high sublattice magnetization fm2 phase ( @xmath31 ) to a high pressure low sublattice magnetization fm1 phase ( @xmath32 ) . as shown in fig.[uge2](a ) , the new features are revealed that i ) the first order line ( @xmath33 ) between fm1 and fm2 terminates at a critical end point ( @xmath34 = 15  k , @xmath35=1  gpa ) and ii ) sc appears just above @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover from fm1 to fm2 due to a continuous mixing of both phase below @xmath35 was drawn from the broadening of the thermal expansion and the resistivity . at ambient pressure </S>",
    "<S> , this definition corresponds to the upper limit of 10% of emerging fm2 content in fm1 and the lower limit to 10% remaining fm1 phase in fm2 as determined by combined specific heat and thermal expansion measurements @xcite . at a pressure </S>",
    "<S> @xmath361.35  gpa applying a magnetic field along the easy axis leads to switch from the initial fm1 to the fm2 state via a metamagnetic transition ; the consequence for sc shown in fig.[uge2](b ) is that the system reenters in the sc+fm2 phase , which has quite different parameters from sc+fm1 ; i.e. @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( and thus @xmath29 and @xmath3 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to urhge , as @xmath9 is not preserved a drastic change of the fermi surface occurs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the concomitant variation of @xmath17 and of @xmath18 are marked by the fact above @xmath37 that its sommerfeld coefficient is almost pressure invariant while @xmath38 in the fm1 phase changes drastically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this simultaneous ( @xmath39 ) variation of @xmath17 and @xmath18 was predicted in the theoretical model of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with a double peaked structure in the density of states .    </S>",
    "<S> these two examples of fm - sc corresponds to the case where @xmath40 . with the recent case of ucoge having @xmath41  3  k and @xmath42  0.6  k @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the hope is to get new coexisting states when @xmath7 and @xmath29 will cross under pressure as the possibility of a cascade from paramagnetic , superconducting and mixed sc+fm states @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) ( @xmath27 ) phase diagram of uge@xmath43 at @xmath28  t. the full diamond represents the @xmath44 line , the star indicates a critical end point at @xmath35 = 1 gpa and @xmath34 = 15  k. the crossover regime below @xmath37 is delimited by the width of the resistivity and thermal expansion bumps created by the proximity of the critical end point . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) superconducting phase diagrams of urhge at ambient pressure ( open circle ) and uge@xmath0 at 1.35  gpa ( open square ) after @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) ( @xmath27 ) phase diagram of cerhin@xmath45 at @xmath28  t from ac calorimetry ( circles ) and from recent nqr experiments ( square ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) ( @xmath46 ) phase diagram at a pressure close to @xmath47 of @xmath48 2.4  gpa . ]    as a guide line , it is interesting to look to careful studies realized under @xmath49 on cerhin@xmath1 @xcite . as shown in fig.[cerhin5](a ) , antiferromagnetism ( af ) and sc are robust at low and high pressure , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a coexisting sc+af phase at zero field occurs only between @xmath50  1.7  gpa and @xmath51 2  gpa , where @xmath52 and @xmath29 merge into one point @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simple idea is a competition or interplay between an af pseudogap @xmath53 and the sc gap @xmath54 assuming that both the af and the sc phase will have the same ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) hot spot in the coexisting domain which seems to be shown by recent nqr results.@xcite . between @xmath55  2.5  gpa , </S>",
    "<S> the new event is the field reentrance of af under magnetic field and the associated creation of vortices @xcite , @xmath56 can exceed @xmath57 as the critical magnetic field @xmath58 40  t at @xmath59  0  k is much larger than the value of the upper critical field @xmath60  t , so far @xmath52 does not collapse , i.e. @xmath61 is lower than @xmath47 . as indicated by the arrows in fig.[cerhin5](b ) , the reentrant af sticked to @xmath62 will collapse at @xmath47 . up to now , attempts to fit the upper critical field curves @xmath63 via the orbital and pauli competition plus additional possibility of strong coupling constant ( @xmath64 ) have failed @xcite ; as discussed previously on fm - sc , for sc of cerhin@xmath1 there is clearly the necessity to incorporate @xmath2 dependence of @xmath16 which is not only pressure dependent .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worthwhile to mention that cecoin@xmath1 at @xmath61 = 0 may be just above @xmath65 , and @xmath66 must be lower than @xmath62 ; then the sc gap will allow to stick af to @xmath62 , so far @xmath67 is below a critical value @xmath68 to allow the establishment of itinerant af ( see @xcite ) . taking into account the strong coupling correlation , with this picture </S>",
    "<S> we arrive to the conclusion that increasing the pressure and thus decreasing the strength of @xmath69 , the af phase will expand in a larger @xmath70 domain than in zero pressure in good agreement with the experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , when the sc gap at zero field will go down to @xmath68 , reentrant magnetism must disappear .    the comparison of the three cases where reentrant phenomena exists show clearly the importance to take into account the @xmath61 and also @xmath2 dependence of the effective mass . for fm - sc of urhge </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity is that only the field dependence of the correlated mass @xmath18 must be considered ; in uge@xmath0 the @xmath61 and @xmath2 variation affect both contributions of the effective mass . with the case of cerhin@xmath1 and cecoin@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , the interplay between an af pseudogap and the sc gap appears the appealing key parameter . </S>",
    "<S> next interesting example to reveal the relation between magnetism and sc is a careful study of the fm superconductor ucoge in the critical regime near 1  gpa where @xmath71 @xcite . </S>"
