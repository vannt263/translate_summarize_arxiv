    "with the advent of quantum field theory our idea of vacuum has been strongly modified with respect to that of classical physics .",
    "vacuum is no more intended as a literal nothing but as a physical entity with a complex structure . within the framework of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) ,",
    "the interest in investigating the properties of quantum vacuum has been growing considerably in the last years , mostly due to the advancement of the strong field laser technique . in particular ,",
    "many experimental schemes have been put forward to measure these properties ( see the recent reviews @xcite and the references therein ) . in fact",
    ", qed predicts that in the presence of very intense electromagnetic fields quantum vacuum manifests dielectric properties due to the polarization of the virtual electron - positron background and even breaks down in stronger fields when virtual electron - positron pairs , acquiring sufficient energy from the field , become real @xcite . the strength scale of the electromagnetic field where the qed vacuum effects become apparent is determined by the so - called critical fields : @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the electron charge and mass , respectively and natural units with @xmath4 are used ) .",
    "the investigation of the properties of qed vacuum is closely connected with the possibility of testing qed in the presence of strong background electromagnetic fields .",
    "however , the values of the critical fields are far beyond the strength of electromagnetic fields that can be produced in terrestrial laboratories . a remarkable exception to this fact",
    "are highly charged nuclei . in the context of qed , `` highly charged nuclei ''",
    "are nuclei with a charge number @xmath5 such that @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the fine structure constant .",
    "in fact , the electric field of highly charged nuclei at the typical qed length @xmath8 ( compton length ) is comparable with the critical field @xmath9 .",
    "this explains the recent experimental successes in measuring the delbrck scattering @xcite , i. e. the scattering of a high - energy photon by the field of a highly charged ion , and the photon splitting in a coulomb field @xcite confirming the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the development of laser technology is opening up the possibility of probing the properties of qed vacuum and of testing qed in the presence of intense wave fields .",
    "although the next generation of petawatt laser systems is expected to reach an intensity of `` only '' @xmath10 @xcite , different theoretical schemes have been put forward to approach the so - called schwinger intensity of @xmath11 @xcite . a significant step towards the schwinger intensity",
    "will be realized in the near future at the extreme light infrastructure ( eli ) where unprecedented intensities of the order of @xmath12 will be attained @xcite .",
    "the ever - increasing available laser intensities have stimulated numerous theoretical proposals to observe `` refractive '' vacuum polarization effects ( vpes ) induced by strong laser fields @xcite , while the observation of `` absorptive '' vpes in colliding laser beams , namely electron - positron pair creation , requires field intensities of the order of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , laser - assisted pair production was observed about ten years ago at the stanford linear accelerator center ( slac ) in the collision of a high - energy electron beam ( @xmath14 ) and an optical laser beam with an intensity of the order of @xmath15 @xcite . due to the large electron energy ,",
    "the effective laser field amplitude and frequency in the rest frame of the electron are much larger than their value in the laboratory frame and this has allowed electron - positron pair creation .    a qed process in a strong laser field , that is characterized by a typical four - momentum of a particle @xmath16 and by a laser field with four - vector potential amplitude @xmath17 , field tensor amplitude @xmath18",
    ", electric field amplitude @xmath19 and frequency @xmath20 , depends on the two invariant parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( the metric @xmath23 is employed ) @xcite .",
    "the classical field parameter @xmath24 can be interpreted as the work done by the laser field on the electron in the compton length @xmath8 in units of the laser photon energy and , therefore , determines the role of multiphoton processes ( at @xmath25 the process is multiphoton ) .",
    "the same parameter @xmath24 also determines the adiabaticity of the process ( the limit @xmath26 and @xmath27 fixed corresponds to the constant crossed field case ) @xcite .",
    "the quantum field parameter @xmath27 determines the magnitude of the quantum nonlinear effects . when @xmath28 multiphoton effects play a minor role and the probability of the process goes to its perturbative weak field limit described by the feynman diagram(s ) of lowest order in the laser field .",
    "in the opposite case of @xmath26 the process is adiabatic , the laser field is almost constant and the photon picture does not hold anymore . in this limit",
    "another perturbative weak field regime exists when the parameter @xmath27 is much smaller than unity . in the following , by `` perturbative regime '' we mean that either @xmath29 or @xmath30 when the process probability can be represented as a power expansion in the corresponding small parameter . in the case of two equal , counterpropagating laser beams , the parameter @xmath27 results from the @xmath18 of one laser beam and from the @xmath31 of a photon of the other laser beam : @xmath32 .",
    "the schemes proposed in @xcite to observe vpes in colliding laser beams are limited to _ perturbative _ processes .",
    "this is because for usual parameters of strong optical lasers , though the condition @xmath33 is easily fulfilled , nevertheless , @xmath34 since @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and , consequently , the nonperturbative effects are suppressed @xcite . however , the vpes can be increased if a strong laser beam collides with a high - energy proton beam .",
    "analogously to the slac experiment @xcite , this is due to the lorentz boost of the laser field amplitude and frequency in the rest frame of the relativistically fast moving proton .",
    "the perturbative regime ( @xmath34 and @xmath37 ) of scattering of a strong laser field with arbitrary polarization by a coulomb field has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the first attempt to go beyond the perturbative regime of vpes in this process has been done in the early work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the laser photon merging was considered in the scattering of a strong _ circularly _ polarized laser field by a coulomb field . due to the symmetry of the system",
    ", however , only two laser photons can merge if the laser field is circularly polarized , i. e. the possibility of multiphoton vpes is in principle ruled out in this case .",
    "moreover , the author explicitly considers only regions of parameters where nonperturbative effects either are completely negligible or cancel out each other , in such a way that the final results are , in fact , perturbative . already in ref . @xcite it was pointed out that the large lorentz boost of a high - energy proton beam enhances the cross - section of the photon merging process in the perturbative case .",
    "moreover , the enhancement of the laser field amplitude and frequency may open a way to nonperturbative regimes : @xmath33 and @xmath38 . in @xcite",
    "we have done the first calculation of probabilities of nonperturbative refractive vpes in the collision of a high - energy proton beam with a linearly polarized , strong laser field and proposed a setup that will allow an observation of the merging of multiple pairs of laser photons into a single high - energy photon due to vpe induced by the proton field and the laser field .",
    "the proton features fit very well the requirements of this setup .",
    "in fact , on the one hand it is light enough to be accelerated to very high energies like up to @xmath39 at the tevatron or even up to @xmath40 at the forthcoming large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , such that the laser field amplitude and frequency in the proton rest frame are significantly larger than their values in the laboratory frame . on the other hand ,",
    "the proton is heavy enough that multiphoton thomson scattering of the laser photons by the proton itself is strongly suppressed .",
    "this is of great advantage with respect to employing , for example , an electron beam because , as we will see , multiphoton thomson scattering represents a background of our process of laser photon merging .",
    "the nonperturbative vpes during a proton and a laser beam collision manifest themselves in two ways .",
    "first , the scaling of the photon merging probability is very sensitive to the laser field parameters .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath33 the probability @xmath41 of the merging of @xmath42 photons scales as @xmath43 if @xmath44 , while in the perturbative case ( @xmath30 ) the scaling is @xmath45 .",
    "second , the multiphoton processes ( merging of @xmath42 laser photons with @xmath46 ) , while being negligibly small in the perturbative regime , become significant and observable in the nonperturbative regime . in our previous letter",
    "@xcite we have investigated the most favorable case for observation of multiphoton vpes by employing proton accelerators already available and the next generation of petawatt optical laser systems .",
    "accordingly , we have calculated the probabilities of the photon merging in the domain of @xmath26 and @xmath27 fixed . however , there are other interesting regimes of parameters which show peculiarities in the amplitudes of the process and which are connected with the possibility of the experimental observation of laser photon merging with the next generation of x - ray - free electron lasers ( x - fels ) like those available in the near future at desy @xcite and at slac @xcite .",
    "the investigation of these regimes is carried out in the present paper .    in the present paper",
    "we thoroughly investigate the laser photon merging process during the proton and laser beam collision in nonperturbative regimes , taking into account exactly the influence of the laser field .",
    "starting from the general expressions of the amplitudes of the process , we obtain analytical asymptotics valid in different parameters regions and analyze ranges of parameters not considered yet .",
    "in particular , additionally to the previous results , we obtain new analytical expressions for the amplitudes of the process in the domain of @xmath28 and for any @xmath47 , as well in the regime of @xmath48 and @xmath25 that are relevant for x - fel .",
    "we also analyze the experimental feasibility of the process with different possible experimental devices .",
    "attention is devoted to the question of how advantageous for the photon merging process could be the complementary virtues of an x - fel with respect to an optical laser , namely , the high photon energy , the high repetition rate and the relatively large space - time volume of the laser beam .",
    "as we will see , the use of optical strong laser fields is much more favorable from an experimental point of view .",
    "for this reason , in addition to the results in @xcite , we also investigate in this case the polarization and the complete angular distribution of the emitted photons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the theoretical model is considered in sec .",
    "the asymptotics of the probability of the process are analyzed in sec .",
    "iii . in the same section",
    ", in each asymptotic limit the corresponding physical situations are considered and the process feasibility is discussed . the summary of sec .",
    "iv concludes the paper . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "we have reported in an appendix the expression of the polarization operator found in @xcite that will be our starting point here .",
    "below , we consider the vpes arising in the head - on collision of a high - energy proton with a strong laser beam .",
    "we assume that the laser beam propagates in the positive @xmath49 direction and that it is linearly polarized along the @xmath50 direction .",
    "the amplitude and the intensity of the laser field will be indicated as @xmath19 and @xmath51 , respectively , whereas @xmath20 is the laser frequency . concerning the proton ,",
    "we have modeled it as an external field due to its large energy and we have ensured that the recoil on the proton of the emitted high - energy photon was negligible in the numerical examples .",
    "we assume that the proton moves with velocity @xmath52 along the negative @xmath49 direction .",
    "the proton mass is indicated as @xmath53 and its relativistic lorentz factor as @xmath54 . as the proton is considered as an external field",
    ", the feynman diagram representing the process of photon merging is that shown in fig .",
    "[ feynman_diagram ] .",
    "the crossed photon leg corresponds to the proton electromagnetic field which is represented by the four - vector potential @xmath55 with @xmath56 being the four - velocity of the proton .",
    "since the proton charge number is @xmath57 , the proton field can be safely taken into account perturbatively at lowest order .",
    "the thick fermion lines in fig .",
    "[ feynman_diagram ] are dressed fermion propagators which exactly include the laser field .",
    "this is achieved by employing the volkov states to build the fermion propagator @xcite .",
    "finally , the photon line on the right in fig .",
    "[ feynman_diagram ] indicates the emitted photon resulting from the merging .",
    "we indicate its four - momentum as @xmath58 , with @xmath59 being the outgoing photon energy , and its two polarization four - vectors as @xmath60 , with @xmath61 .",
    "the presence of the laser field can in principle induce a mass different from zero of the outgoing photon through vacuum polarization and the appearance of a third , longitudinal photon mode @xcite . in order to estimate these effects",
    "we assume that the emitted photon counterpropagates with the laser field . from the expression of the polarization operator in a laser field",
    "one sees that at fixed @xmath62 then these effects are @xmath63 times smaller than those considered here , apart from the asymptotic case @xmath64 in which they are @xmath65 times smaller @xcite . in both cases , then , they can be safely neglected for realistic parameters .",
    "instead , in the constant crossed field limit @xmath33 and @xmath66 fixed , these effects scale as @xmath67 if @xmath68 and @xmath69 if @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "in this situation they become important at @xmath71 but we will not consider this extreme case .",
    "the two amplitudes of the laser photon merging process depending on the final photon polarization state are given by ( see fig . [ feynman_diagram ] ) @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the vacuum polarization tensor in a laser field @xcite and where @xmath74 is the four - dimensional fourier transform of the four - vector potential in eq .",

    "a few observations are in order .",

    "third , the parameter @xmath27 defined in the introduction depends here on the number of laser photons merged and it is equal to @xmath114 this is because the momentum @xmath16 entering the definition of @xmath27 is given here by @xmath106 or , which is equivalent , by the momentum transfer from the proton .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that , in general , the series in eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) also contains terms with @xmath115 .",
    "these terms vanish in the situation at hand because , _ as we have shown in the appendix , _ the four - dimensional @xmath77 functions in eq .",

    ", it also gives rise to a radiative correction to thomson scattering without net absorption of laser photons .",
    "both these corrections are @xmath63 times smaller than the effect considered here and will be neglected .",
    "the coefficients @xmath103 show a highly nonperturbative dependence on the laser field parameters through @xmath24 and @xmath105 .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 , as already mentioned in the introduction , is responsible for the magnitude of high - order vacuum effects in the laser intensity .",
    "the quantity @xmath117 is the total energy of a laser photon and the outgoing photon in their center - of - momentum frame when @xmath42 laser photons merge in unit of the electron mass .    at this point , in order to calculate the total rate @xmath118 of emitted photons one has to employ the amplitudes @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) and apply the fermi golden rule @xcite : @xmath119 here , we have assumed a space - time integration volume equal to unity and we have exploited the dirac @xmath77 function to perform the integral on the energy of the outgoing photon .",
    "@xmath120 indicates the differential solid angle relative to the outgoing photon direction . by employing the expressions of the four - vectors @xmath121 in eq .",
    "( [ lambda_j ] ) , one can easily show that @xmath122 also , since the four - vectors @xmath89 are both perpendicular to @xmath80 ( see eq .",

    "( [ r ] ) over the outgoing photon polarizations we can employ the substitution @xcite @xmath123 note that , in general , the sum should include the four polarization states of the photon ( in this case the above equation becomes an equality ) .",
    "however , due to gauge invariance only the two transverse photon polarization states contribute to the photon merging rate .",
    "this can also be verified through a direct calculation by observing that @xmath124 and by reminding that @xmath82 . in this way , the integration over the angle @xmath112 in eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) can be easily taken and , by introducing the rate @xmath125 of the laser photon merging with an absorption of @xmath42 laser photons , we obtain @xmath126 from this expression it is clear that the evaluation of the laser photon merging rate reduces to the evaluation of the two coefficients @xmath103 .",
    "their general expressions in eq .",
    "( [ c_j_n_ex ] ) are rather complex and , as we will see in the next section , they can be simplified in different asymptotical regions of the parametric space @xmath127 .",
    "we conclude this section with the following observation that we have mentioned in the introduction .",
    "it can easily be seen that the photons emitted via 2@xmath101-multiphoton thomson scattering of laser photons by the proton have the same energy as the photons emitted via the 2@xmath101-laser photon merging process because the kinematics of the two processes is the same ( see the review @xcite for a detailed discussion of multiphoton thomson scattering in the case of electrons ) .",
    "both processes occur in the collision of a proton and a laser beam and they interfere . as it is clear from the feynman diagram in fig .",
    "[ feynman_diagram ] , the photon merging process is qualitatively different from the multiphoton thomson scattering ( see fig . [ multiphot_thomson ] ) . in the latter , the photons of the laser",
    "interact _ directly _ with the proton through its electric charge .",
    "in the former , instead , the laser photons interact with the _ electromagnetic field _ of the proton through a virtual electron - positron pair .",
    "an immediate consequence of this difference is that the process of multiphoton thomson scattering , though being a process of lower order in @xmath63 than the process of @xmath42-laser photon merging , is nevertheless suppressed due to the large proton mass @xmath128 and in the limit @xmath129 the amplitude of the process vanishes .",
    "this is not the case of the laser photon merging process which has a finite leading - order amplitude in the limit @xmath129 that exactly corresponds to the feynman diagram in fig .",
    "[ feynman_diagram ] .",
    "the expressions ( [ c_j_n_ex ] ) of the coefficients @xmath103 hold for any value of the two physical parameters @xmath24 and @xmath105 . however , these expressions are rather complex and difficult to use for quantitative estimations .",
    "simpler analytical expressions can be found in different limits of the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath105 .",
    "as we will see below , this corresponds to various physical situations when different laser systems could be employed to observe the process of laser photon merging like , for example , x - fels or strong optical lasers . to the sake of completeness , we report here also the results obtained in @xcite concerning the case of an optical laser field ( see par .",
    "the expressions of the amplitudes for the case in which the strong laser field is an x - fel are obtained here for the first time and are reported in par . iii.a and par . iii.c .",
    "we consider in this paragraph the asymptotic expressions of the coefficients @xmath103 when the parameter @xmath24 can be considered much smaller than unity , while the parameter @xmath105 is arbitrary but fixed .",
    "this case is particularly suitable for treating the practical situation in which the strong laser field is that of an x - fel .",
    "in fact , due to the large laser frequency and the low intensity , the parameter @xmath24 for an x - fel is much smaller than unity . as a check , we consider the following laser parameters that will be available with the tesla project at desy @xcite : a laser frequency @xmath130 , a laser peak power of @xmath131 and a spot radius of @xmath132 corresponding to a peak intensity @xmath133 , and we merely obtain @xmath134 .",
    "on the other hand , being the laser frequency only two - three orders of magnitude smaller than the electron mass , it would then be limiting ( as we will see in a numerical example below ) to restrict anyway the values of the parameter @xmath105 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) ) mostly in the case of a high - energy proton beam .",
    "as we have mentioned , in the present case with @xmath29 , the laser field can be treated perturbatively . by expanding the exponential and the bessel functions in the coefficients @xmath103 with respect to the small parameter @xmath24",
    ", one sees that the leading term of the series is proportional to @xmath135 .",
    "this term corresponds to the process of laser photon merging in which @xmath42 laser photons merge .",
    "the next terms in the expansion result proportional to @xmath136 , with @xmath137 being a positive integer , and correspond to the process of @xmath42-laser photon merging accompanied by the exchange of @xmath137 laser photons without _ net _ absorption . due to the dependence on @xmath135 ,",
    "higher - order processes are suppressed and the leading contribution to the laser photon merging process comes from the term with @xmath138 and @xmath139 , i. e. from the merging of two laser photons without any additional exchange .",
    "one of the feynman box - diagrams representing this process is shown in fig .",
    "[ box_diagram ] .",
    "_ in the remaining two , the laser photon lines are both either above or below the proton field and the outgoing photon lines .",
    "the use of the volkov states as electron states automatically takes also into account the contribution of all these diagrams .",
    "it is also worth observing here that another diagram is present with four external photon lines , namely the one with one laser photon and two proton field lines .",
    "this diagram is the lowest - order diagram contributing to the delbrck scattering of a laser photon by the proton .",
    "the probability of this process is roughly @xmath140 times the probability of 2-laser photon merging and then it can be dominating in the present case .",

    "if one includes the two processes by summing their amplitudes , one obtains about 360 events as the total number of photons produced .",

    "this is a clear indication of the qualitative and quantitative difference between the perturbative and the nonperturbative regime in the process of laser photon merging .",
    "it is worth observing that here the number of events per hour is not much smaller than that obtained in the numerical example shown in @xcite where in the nonperturbative regime we obtained about 390 2-photon merging events per hour .",
    "this is due to the fact that here the spacetime overlapping of the laser beam and the proton beam is much larger than in @xcite where a tight focused ( @xmath223 ) , short ( @xmath224 ) laser pulse was employed .",

    "the relatively low proton energy can be compensated by employing a strong attosecond pulse of extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) radiation ( see @xcite ) : intensity of @xmath229 , photon energy of @xmath230 and pulse duration of @xmath231 .",
    "this xuv pulse , according to @xcite , can be produced by the reflection from a plasma surface of an ultra - strong laser pulse of @xmath232 duration , intensity @xmath233 , focused onto a spot - radius of @xmath234 which assumes conversion efficiency of @xmath235 ( we have extrapolated the values of the conversion efficiency that in @xcite are available for initial laser intensities up to about @xmath236 ; however , the conversion efficiency weakly depends on the laser intensity at high relativistic intensities ) .",
    "the dependence of the 2-photon merging rates @xmath213 and @xmath214 is similar to that in fig . 5 and we do nt report it . for the total rates we obtain 6.9 photons per shot only due to 2-photon thomson scattering , 5.2 photons per shot only due to 2-laser photon merging and 12.1 photons per shot due to the two processes together .",
    "we also stress that the simulations performed in @xcite have been carried out for laser intensities much smaller than those available at eli .",
    "if the results of @xcite can be scaled to intensities of the order of @xmath12 like those available at eli , much larger rates can be expected .",
    "moreover , the values of the parameters @xmath184 can reach the order of unity and non - perturbative , multiphoton vpes ( merging of more than two laser photons ) could become observable .",

    "<S> the quantum electrodynamical vacuum polarization effects arising in the collision of a high - energy proton beam and a strong , linearly polarized laser field are investigated . the probability that laser photons merge into one photon by interacting with the protons electromagnetic field </S>",
    "<S> is calculated taking into account the laser field exactly . </S>",
    "<S> asymptotics of the probability are then derived according to different experimental setups suitable for detecting perturbative and nonperturbative vacuum polarization effects . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally most feasible setup involves the use of a strong optical laser field . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in this case measurements of the polarization of the outgoing photon and and of its angular distribution provide promising tools to detect these effects for the first time . </S>"
