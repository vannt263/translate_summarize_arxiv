    "this paper is a higher dimensional sequel of the recent article @xcite by the first and the third authors ( and also of @xcite ) . as such it aims to construct global in time solutions of the cubic wave equation with low regularity ( infinite energy ) random initial data . to the best of our knowledge such",
    "a regularity is out of reach of the present deterministic methods .",
    "the major difference between the present paper and @xcite is that here we only establish existence results and in particular no uniqueness statement is proven .",
    "let us recall that in @xcite a suitable uniqueness and a probabilistic continuity of the flow were proven .",
    "this result was followed by more recent results by nahmod - pavlovic - staffilani  @xcite on the @xmath1 and @xmath0-dimensional homogeneous navier - stokes equation , where the authors obtain strong ( in @xmath1-d ) and weak ( in @xmath0-d ) results , and in turn , here we are inspired by this latter @xmath0-d weak - existence result . related weak - existence results had been already used in the context of the randomly forced navier - stokes equation by da prato - debussche   @xcite and the euler equation by albeverio - cruzeiro  @xcite , using more sophisticated probabilistic tools ( prokhorov and skorohod theorems ) .",
    "this approach may be seen as the analogue in the random setting of the leray compactness method for constructing solutions of nonlinear evolution equations .",
    "it has the advantage to require less regularity on the initial data , one allows infinite energy while the leray method requires finite energy of the data .",
    "it should however be emphasised that as in the leray method our approach still makes a crucial use of the energy functional . in this paper",
    "we will only need an invariance property for the linear evolution combined with large deviation estimates on the nonlinear part which are much easier to achieve than the invariance properties as in @xcite .",
    "let us now describe our model .",
    "let @xmath2 and consider the cubic wave equation on the torus @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the laplace operator and @xmath6 denote by @xmath7 the critical ( scaling ) sobolev index for .",
    "then one can show that is well - posed in @xmath8 for @xmath9 ( @xcite ) and ill - posed when @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "see the introduction of @xcite for more details .",
    "the energy of reads @xmath11 thus with deterministic compactness methods due to leray ( see _ e.g. _ lebeau ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) for the application of the method in the context of ) , we can construct global weak solutions to so that @xmath12 ( here @xmath13 means weak continuity in time ) and @xmath14 for all @xmath15 .",
    "observe that for @xmath16 one has @xmath17 and thus the construction of weak solutions works for data of supercritical regularity with respect to the scaling of the equation .",
    "however it requires finite energy of the initial data .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show that weak solutions still exist for infinite energy , almost surely with respect to a large class of probability measures .",
    "let us now describe precisely the initial data sets ( statistical ensembles ) that we shall consider in this article .",
    "here we follow @xcite .",
    "let @xmath18 and let @xmath19 with fourier series @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "then let @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 be a sequence of independent real random variables given on a probability space @xmath25 with a joint distribution @xmath26 satisfying @xmath27 we then define the random variables @xmath28 by @xmath29 and we define the measure @xmath30 on @xmath8 as the image of @xmath31 under the map @xmath32 we then define @xmath33 by @xmath34 denote by @xmath35 the free wave evolution .",
    "then our result reads    [ theo1 ] let @xmath18 and @xmath36 .",
    "then there exists a set @xmath37 of full @xmath38 measure so that for every @xmath39 the equation with initial condition @xmath40 has a solution @xmath41 where for any @xmath42 @xmath43 moreover , for all @xmath15 @xmath44 with @xmath45 for some @xmath46 .",
    "let us recall ( see @xcite ) that if the measure @xmath47 is constructed using data @xmath48 , then @xmath49 , while if for some @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 , then as soon as the random variables @xmath52 do not accumulate at @xmath53 ( for example , in the case where they are non trivial and identically distributed , then @xmath54 . on the other hand , under rather weak assumptions , @xmath55 for any non empty open ball @xmath56 ( see ( * ? ?",
    "* proposition 1.2 ) ) .",
    "let us now mention two possible extensions of our result . in the case @xmath57 one may expect to get uniqueness by combining the analysis of @xcite with the critical @xmath58 theory for .",
    "one may also expect to include the case @xmath59 by elaborating on the arguments developed in @xcite to treat this case .",
    "it is not clear to us what happens for @xmath60 ( and in @xcite as well ) .",
    "in particular we do not know whether @xmath59 is the optimal regularity one may achieve by our approach .",
    "invariant gibbs measures for dispersive equations were extensively studied ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . in these papers",
    "the gibbs measure is combined with a suitable local in time result ( which can sometimes be quite involved ) to get global existence and uniqueness on the support of the measure . by an extension of the method ( using in particular skorohod and prokhorov theorems ) we use in this paper one",
    "may construct a dynamics ( without any uniqueness ) on the support of a gibbs measure and prove its invariance .",
    "we plan to give several relevant examples of this observation in @xcite .",
    "we however do not see how to make work such an approach in the context of .",
    "indeed , the present methods of renormalization of gibbs measures are restricted to dimensions @xmath61 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "let us also recall that as mentioned above a global existence based on gibbs measures only works for a very specific choice of the initial distribution . on the other hand , it has of course the advantage to give a quite remarkable dynamical property of the flow .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sect.3 ]",
    "we recall stochastic properties of the linear flow which were proven in @xcite . in section [ sect.4 ]",
    "we study the dynamics of an approximation of .",
    "section [ sect.5 ] is devoted to the proof of theorem [ theo1 ] .",
    "we thank arnaud debussche for discussions and for pointing out the reference @xcite .",
    "the second author is very grateful to philippe carmona for many clarifications on measures .",
    "once for all we fix @xmath18 and @xmath62 .",
    "recall the definition of the linear wave propagator @xmath63 . in this section",
    "we prove estimates which reflect the invariance of @xmath38 under @xmath63 .",
    "this is the only measure invariance aspect used in this paper .",
    "denote by @xmath64 . for a fourier series @xmath65 @xmath66 we denote by @xmath67 and for @xmath68 @xmath69 let @xmath70 , so that @xmath71 on @xmath72 .",
    "let us also introduce the smooth spectral projector @xmath73 which will be needed in the next section .",
