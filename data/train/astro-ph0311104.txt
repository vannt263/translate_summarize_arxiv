    "as our cosmological knowledge and techniques mature , it becomes increasingly important to strive for observations and methods which are , as much as possible , immune to known systematic effects as well as being statistically powerful .",
    "nowhere is this more true than in the field of weak gravitational lensing . since its detection by several groups three years ago ( bacon , refregier & ellis 2000 ; kaiser , wilson & luppino 2000",
    "; van waerbeke et al . 2000 ; wittman et al . 2000 ) , weak gravitational lensing by large - scale structure has become a well established technique , used already to set constraints on the mass density ( @xmath1 ) and the fluctuation amplitude @xmath2 ( e.g. , see van waerbeke & mellier 2003 for the current status ) and touted for its potential to constrain cluster scaling relations ( huterer & white 2002 ) and dark energy ( benabed & bernardeau 2001 ; huterer 2002 ; hu 2002a , b ; heavens 2003 ; abazajian & dodelson 2003 ; refregier et al .",
    "2003 ; jain & taylor 2003 ; bernstein & jain 2003 ; takada & jain 2003 , hereafter tj03 ) .",
    "there are many sources of systematic errors which can affect lensing measurements .",
    "one source in particular , intrinsic ellipticity alignments of source galaxies ( heavens , refregier & heymans 2000 ; catelan , kamionkowski & blandford 2001 ; crittenden et al .",
    "2001 ; pen , lee & seljak 2001 ; mackey , white & kamionkowski 2002 ; jing 2002 ) can not be mitigated by improved instrumentation or reliably predicted by theory . while likely not important for the current generation of experiments ( heymans et al .",
    "2003 ) , it could prove to be a limiting uncertainty in more ambitious ongoing and future surveys such as the cfht legacy survey , the deep lens survey , dml / lsst , pan - starrs and snap .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we discuss a simple , largely ( astrophysical ) model independent , technique to reduce the susceptibility of weak lensing measurements to intrinsic alignments of galaxies .",
    "this technique assumes only that the intrinsic alignments fall off on scales above a few tens of mpc while the lensing signal builds up over gpc scales .",
    "we emphasize the advantages of splitting the galaxy distribution into multiple redshift bins and considering only the cross - power spectra .",
    "these have no shot noise bias , contain most of the cosmological information and should be totally insensitive to intrinsic alignments . while not as powerful as model dependent methods ( heymans & heavens 2003 ; king & schneider 2002 , 2003 ; heymans et al .",
    "2003 ) these latter require modeling of intrinsic alignments , which involves many uncertain aspects of galaxy formation .",
    "all future surveys will provide photometric redshift information on source galaxies .",
    "this additional information allows us to subdivide the galaxies into redshift bins which is crucial if these surveys are to be used to constrain the evolution of cosmological parameters .",
    "we shall assume throughout that we have the ability to divide our source population into redshift bins , commenting on some of the issues in the conclusions .    in the context of cosmological gravitational lensing and assuming the born approximation ( blandford et al .",
    "1991 ; miralda - escude 1991 ; kaiser 1992 , and see jain , seljak & white 2000 and vale & white 2003 for tests ) , the lensing convergence field can be expressed as a weighted projection of the 3d density fluctuation field between observer and source ( also see bartelmann & schneider 2001 ; mellier 1999 for reviews ) : @xmath3 , \\label{eqn : kappai}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the angular position on the sky , @xmath5 is the comoving distance , and @xmath6 is the distance to the horizon .",
    "we shall assume throughout a spatially flat universe .",
    "the lensing weight function , @xmath7 , for galaxies of subsample @xmath8 sitting in a redshift bin @xmath8 can be written @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the scale factor , @xmath11 is the redshift distribution of source galaxies and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the hubble constant and @xmath1 the present day value of the matter density in units of the critical density .",
    "following tj03 , we assume @xmath14 with @xmath15 and the average number density of galaxies per steradian , @xmath16 , which peaks at @xmath17 and has median redshift @xmath18 . the quantity @xmath19 is the average number density of galaxies in a redshift bin @xmath8 , defined to lie between the comoving distances @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath22 , and we have assumed sharp subdivisions of the galaxy redshift distribution for simplicity .",
    "it is worth noting the dependence on the cosmology in these expressions .",
    "the overall shear amplitude is sensitive to @xmath1 and @xmath23 , which explains the status of cosmological constraints derived from current lensing surveys .",
    "tomography allows us to recover the redshift evolution of the efficiency , @xmath7 , and the mass clustering and the evolution of @xmath5 for non power - law power spectra .",
    "each of these is sensitive to the equation of state of dark energy , however the constraints are determined mainly by the dependence of the lensing efficiency ( see e.g.  figure 2 in abazajian & dodelson 2003 ) .      using the flat sky approximation and the limber approximation ( limber 1954 ; kaiser 1992 ) , the angular power spectrum between the lensing fields of redshift bins @xmath8 and @xmath24 is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the 3d mass power spectrum .",
    "the limber approximation holds well over the angular scales we consider : @xmath27 ( jain et al . 2000 ; white & hu 2000 ; vale & white 2003 ) . for @xmath28",
    "the major contribution to @xmath29 comes from non - linear clustering ( jain & seljak 1997 ; also see figure 2 in tj03 ) and we employ the fitting formula of smith et al .  (",
    "2003 ) for @xmath26 , assuming that it can be applied to dark energy cosmologies ( e.g.  white & vale 2003 ) .",
    "we note in passing that the issue of accurate power spectra for general dark energy cosmologies still needs to be addressed carefully ( see huterer 2002 for related discussion ) .    assuming that the intrinsic ellipticity distribution is uncorrelated between different galaxies , the observed power spectrum between redshift bins @xmath8 and @xmath24 can be written ( kaiser 1992 , 1998 ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the rms of the intrinsic ellipticities and the kronecker delta function accounts for the fact that the cross - power measurement is not biased by shot noise .",
    "in addition , the cross - power is totally insensitive to intrinsic ellipticity alignments , if the bins are much larger than 10 mpc ( heymans & heavens 2003 ; king & schneider 2002 , 2003 ; heymans et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "assuming gaussian statistics , the covariance between the power spectra @xmath29 and @xmath32 is @xmath33 ,   \\label{eqn : covps}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the fraction of sky covered , @xmath35 is the bin width and we have suppressed the argument , @xmath36 , of @xmath37 . if we restrict our analysis to angular scales @xmath38 the statistical properties of the lensing fields are close to gaussian ( white & hu 2000 ; cooray & hu 2001 ) .",
    "further the shot - noise will provide the dominant contribution to the covariance on the small scales where tomography derives most of its cosmological constraints , strengthening the case for our gaussian error assumption .",
    "it is important to note that even if we consider only the cross - power spectra , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the shot noise contributes to the covariance when @xmath41 and so on .",
    "hence , the shot noise induces the statistical errors in the cross - power spectrum measurement , which in turn propagate into cosmological parameters .",

    "we consider angular scales @xmath27 , and assume @xmath44 , @xmath53 arcmin@xmath43 and @xmath45 .",
    "note that all the errors scale with the sky coverage as @xmath54 . given tomography with @xmath55 redshift bins , each bin",
    "is chosen so as to have an equal number density of galaxies for the redshift distribution ( [ eqn : pz ] ) ; e.g. , @xmath56 for three redshift bins .",
    "for all the cases we have considered the redshift bins are sufficiently thick , @xmath57 , that contamination from intrinsic alignments will be significantly reduced .",
    "following tj03 , we use the fisher matrix formalism to examine how lensing tomography can constrain cosmological parameters . assuming the likelihood function for the lensing power spectrum to be gaussian , the fisher matrix can be expressed as @xmath58^{-1 } \\frac{\\partial c_{(mn)}(l)}{\\partial p_\\beta } , \\label{eqn : psfis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the inverse covariance matrix is denoted by @xmath59^{-1}$ ] with @xmath60 given by equation ( [ eqn : covps ] ) and the @xmath61 denote the cosmological parameters . to use only the cross - power spectra we simply omit @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the summation of equation ( [ eqn : psfis ] ) . for @xmath55 redshift bins , we can use @xmath64 cross - spectra .",
    "hence , to extract redshift evolution of the lensing observables requires at least 3 redshift bins .",
    "the parameter forecasts derived are sensitive to the parameter space used and to whether constraint on a given parameter is obtained by marginalizing over other parameter uncertainties .",
    "we use seven parameters to which the lensing observables are sensitive within the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath23 , @xmath55 @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath65 and @xmath70 are the density parameters of dark energy and baryons , @xmath55 is the spectral index of primordial scalar perturbations , @xmath69 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath23 is the rms mass fluctuation in a sphere of radius @xmath71mpc .",
    "we use a simple parameterization of the equation of state of dark energy : @xmath72 ( turner & white 1997 ; linder 2003 ) and assume a spatially flat universe .",
    "for the input linear mass power spectrum , we employ the bbks transfer function ( bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) with the shape parameter given by sugiyama ( 1995 ) .    for the fiducial model we take @xmath73cdm model with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which is consistent with the recent wmap results ( spergel et al .",
    "we assume the priors @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , expected from the planck mission ( see table 2 in eisenstein et al .",
    "assuming gaussian priors , we add the diagonal component @xmath84 to the lensing fisher matrix .",
    "the table shows that , for three redshift bins , cross - power spectrum tomography more than doubles the parameter errors from tomography including the auto - spectra , because we can use only 3 of the 6 spectra .",
    "however , adding even one redshift bin drastically improves the constraints . as a result , cross - power spectrum tomography for @xmath85 recovers most of cosmological information contained in the auto- and cross - power spectra : degradation in the @xmath86-@xmath87 errors are as small as @xmath88 .",
    "figure [ fig : chins5 ] shows the constraint ellipses in the parameter space of @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 for five redshift bins .",
    "note that the ellipses correspond to @xmath89 confidence level ( @xmath90 ) , including marginalization over the other parameters . in this case",
    "we can use 10 cross - power spectra for the tomography .",
    "it is clear that degeneracy directions in the parameter space are almost identical between the two tomography methods , and the ellipse areas differ by only @xmath91 .",
    "tj03 showed that using both power spectrum and bispectrum tomography provides improvements in parameter constraints of a factor of 3 over power spectrum tomography alone .",
    "this is because significant additional information is contained in the non - gaussian nature of the large scale structure inducing the weak lensing .",
    "while @xmath92 bispectra can be constructed from @xmath55 redshift bins for tomography , only the @xmath55 auto - bispectra are contaminated from intrinsic alignments , allowing us to use the other @xmath93 bispectra for cross - bispectrum tomography .",
    "the column labeled with `` + bisp '' in table [ tab : const ] compares the results when we use all the power spectra and bispectra or use only the cross - spectra for five redshift bins .",
    "as expected , cross - bispectrum tomography loses little cosmological information and significantly improves parameter errors derived from the cross - power spectrum tomography .",
    "we have proposed lensing tomography that only uses the cross - spectra constructed from source galaxies in different redshift bins .",
    "cross - spectrum tomography provides a simple , robust and model independent means of reducing systematics from intrinsic alignments which retains most of the cosmological information . for more than 4 redshift bins , cross - spectrum tomography yields errors on cosmological parameters only @xmath88 larger than errors including the auto - spectra ( see table [ tab : const ] )",
    "the situation is further improved by combining with cross - bispectrum tomography .",
    "as future experiments concentrate on subdividing the source galaxies into multiple redshift bins to better reconstruct the lensing effect as a function of distance , it becomes more important to guard against contamination by intrinsic alignments .",
    "intrinsic alignments are difficult to predict , with calculations differing by an order of magnitude at present . however , simply neglecting intrinsic alignments could bias estimates of cosmological parameters from future lensing surveys ( heymans et al .",
    "our suggestion is intermediate between detailed modeling of the effect and simple neglect .",
    "we believe it is worth exploring a 3d mass reconstruction technique using only the lensing effects on galaxies in different redshift bins even if this is only used as a ` sanity check ' during the analysis",
    ".    finally we remark on some issues regarding photometric redshift determinations . in order to implement our procedure",
    "we require more redshift bins than is usual for tomographic techniques ( which frequently saturate at 2 or 3 bins ) .",
    "this requires more accurate photo-@xmath94 determinations , but still well within the range of possible accuracies .",
    "for example , _ snap _ is designed to achieve accurate photo-@xmath94 measurement with a random error @xmath95 ( massey et al .",
    "this would allow us to perform tomography with up to 10 redshift bins in the range @xmath96 .",
    "of course it is still crucial to calibrate the photo-@xmath94 estimates to the percent level , since constraints on the cosmological parameters come from measuring the lensing efficiency to the percent level .",
    "this will require a spectroscopic survey to calibrate the photo-@xmath94 distribution , as discussed in bernstein & jain ( 2003 ) .",
    "such a measurement should also mitigate against another important systematic arising from the tails of the photo-@xmath94 distribution : the misidentification as source galaxies of a fraction of galaxies which actually lie near the lensing plane leading to a misestimation of the lensing efficiency .",
    "both effects can be controlled introducing gaps , larger than the photo-@xmath94 error , in the galaxy distribution when computing the cross power spectra between neighboring bins .",
    "we have found that even gaps with @xmath97 , a typical photo-@xmath94 error from a five color survey , enlarge the errors from cross spectrum tomography with 5 redshift bins by less than 5% , as expected from our earlier discussion . while further study ( including realistic photo-@xmath94 errors ) is needed , this issue is not significantly different for cross - spectra and auto - spectra .",

    "mt would like to thank j.  cohn , g.  smoot and the berkeley cosmology group for their warm hospitality while this work was initiated .",
