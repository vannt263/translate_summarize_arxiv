    "the perturbative vacuum in the pure bosonic string models is known to be unstable because of the existence of the tachyonic mode , leaving open the possibility of the existence of another stable vacuum .",
    "this question was first investigated for open strings in references @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and later , using string field theory techniques , in @xcite , @xcite , and the indications are that there is such a vacuum .    more recently ,",
    "sen @xcite has revived interest in this subject by his investigations of the brane - antibrane complex in the superstring , which also has a tachyonic instability , due to the breaking of supersymmetry . since then , there has been numerous papers on this subject ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "all of these papers reach the conclusion that in the end , tachyon condensation takes place , and as a result , the supersymmetric vacuum is restored .",
    "the tachyon instability can be pictured in analogy with higgs phenomenon as resulting from the perturbative vacuum being put on top of the tachyon potential well .",
    "most of the efforts in the literature were directed towards an explicit calculation of the space - time tachyon potential in various approximation schemes . recently in papers @xcite , @xcite an effective tachyon lagrangian in the first derivative approximation was calculated exactly by applying methods of background independent open string field theory .",
    "perhaps less explicitly but technically easier the tachyon condensation in open string theory can be studied by methods of boundary conformal field theory ( bcft ) .",
    "the general idea is as follows . in the sigma model formulation of open string theory",
    "the starting point is a world - sheet action of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a fixed bulk action specifying the closed string background that can be taken to be the standard flat background and @xmath2 is a boundary perturbation .",
    "for example in the open bosonic theory one can consider @xmath3\\ ] ] where @xmath4 $ ] is the tachyonic field profile .",
    "the classical open string equations of motion follow from the requirement of the world - sheet conformal invariance that is ensured by vanishing of the beta functions of the world - sheet theory . the world - sheet rg flow to the ir induced by the boundary perturbation @xmath2 thus describes approaching a classical solution in space - time .",
    "this classical solution in general corresponds to some intermediate metastable state that can be perturbed further until the system reaches the true vacuum .",
    "the perturbation of the form ( [ tach - pot ] ) was studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown in that paper that for a particular choice of the potential @xmath4 $ ] ( previously considered in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) the arising rg flow describes disintegration of d25 brane into a system of lower - dimensional branes .",
    "other types of brane descend relations in bosonic string theory were studied in @xcite .",
    "it is believed that at the final point of tachyon condensation the theory contains no open string excitations at all .",
    "thus , quite generally tachyon condensation is the process describing a reduction of the number of open strings degrees of freedom .",
    "a natural measure of the number of degrees of freedom in bcft is the boundary entropy @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that at least in the lowest order in conformal perturbation theory this quantity always decreases .    in this paper",
    "we consider boundary backgrounds of a more general type than ( [ tach - pot ] ) that include nontrivial chan - paton factors .",
    "inclusion of chan - paton factors results in a path integral measure on the world - sheet with boundary that is weighted by @xmath5 where @xmath6 in general depends on @xmath7 and its derivatives and carries matrix indices corresponding to chan - paton degrees of freedom .",
    "the boundary probes we consider are constructed as follows .",
    "we first compactify a number of extra dimensions at self - dual radii , thereby generating an internal affine algebra .",
    "this algebra is then coupled to external chan - paton factors in various representations of subgroups of the affine algebra . in this fashion , the direct product of the external and internal groups",
    "is broken down to the diagonal subgroup , and the resulting models are various generalizations of the kondo model .",
    "although the boundary interaction is mediated by an operator whose conformal dimension is marginal , the models are not conformal for arbitrary coupling constant . following the work of affleck and collaborators @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite on the kondo model , we assume that under the renormalization group flow , the coupling constant flows into a unique value demanded by conformal invariance . consequently , one obtains a conformal model with a specific boundary interaction , which can be solved exactly by various methods .",
    "the resulting physics is well known from the example of the kondo model : the boundary spin ( chan - paton factors ) fuses with the internal spin and leads to a reordering of the levels .",
    "a possible relation of a different sort between kondo - like problems and the tachyon condensation on branes was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the method of solution we choose makes use of what we call the singlet operators , which are combinations of the chan - paton wavefunction with the standard twist operators ( e.g. see @xcite ) , which explicitly exhibit the fusion of the boundary `` spin '' into the bulk .",
    "these are most conveniently constructed in terms of the bosonic string operators . in many cases ,",
    "simple fermionic representations also exist , and they are also of some interest . in this way , we are able to treat a variety of problems , involving both single and double boundaries , and several different compactifications , resulting in symmetry groups ranging all the way from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "we consider several examples , and for these , we compute the spectra , and exhibit both the states and the vertex operators for low lying levels . in the case of @xmath8 , we also work out some of the 4 point amplitudes",
    ". the result of these calculations can be summarized very simply : the momenta in the compactified dimensions , which were integerly spaced in natural units at the beginning , flow into half integer values . in the fermionic language when it is applicable , such as in the case of @xmath10 , this often means a change in the fermionic boundary conditions : the ns fermions flow into the r fermions .",
    "all of this is in agreement with the results of affleck and collaborators @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the mass of the original tachyon is lifted up , in some cases all the way up to zero , and in other cases only part of the way .",
    "unfortunately , consistency requires that integer valued momenta must always be present , and so , although the tachyon mass may be lifted in some channels , it will reappear unchanged in other channels .",
    "next , we generalize from @xmath8 to higher groups such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath9 by compactifying in increasing number of dimensions . in these cases , one has more options with the choice of the group representations for the chan - paton wave functions , and compared to @xmath8 , more complicated patterns of shift in the spectrum emerge . in the fermionic picture ,",
    "when it exists , the general rule is a flow from ns to ramond fermions .",
    "we also consider the @xmath13 groups , and discuss the case @xmath14 in detail , pointing out the simple description of what is happening in the t - dual picture in terms of d - branes .",
    "we give a further discussion of a possible brane interpretation of the rg flows we considered in the last section of the paper .",
    "we end with some speculations about flowing into a superstring .",
    "the most favorable case is the full compactification of 16 coordinates , resulting in the @xmath9 group . in the fermionic picture , after the flow from ns to ramond fermions , one has the full world sheet fermionic structure needed to construct the superstring .",
    "this possibility of the bosonic string leading to a superstring has been suggested before @xcite , @xcite ( see @xcite for some of the more recent suggestions ) and remains to see whether it can be fully realized .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we consider the compactification of one extra dimension of the open bosonic string at self dual radius , with the resulting @xmath8 current algebra .",
    "in addition , we introduce external @xmath15 chan - paton factors , and couple the two su(2 ) s into the diagonal subgroup",
    ". we then study in detail the the conformal theory into which this model flows . in section 3 , we construct the corresponding vertex operators and compute some four point amplitudes explicitly , and we also show how to extend the computation to higher amplitudes .",
    "these calculations show that the originally integerly moded momenta of the compactified dimension flow into half integer values . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss the compactification of two extra dimensions , with the resulting @xmath16 or @xmath10 current algebra .",
    "coupling one of the @xmath8 s to chan - paton factors , we again find a shift of half a unit in the bosonic momenta .",
    "we also reconsider the same problem using fermionic fields , and show that the half integer shift in the bosonic momenta corresponds to a flow from the ns fermions to ramond fermions in the fermionic picture .",
    "these results agree with the well - known results in the kondo model . in section 5 ,",
    "we consider the compactification of extra dimensions all the way up to 16 , and the resulting more complicated conformal models based on bigger groups are studied by the same methods as before .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we list some interesting problems that our work naturally suggests .",
    "in string theory there are two different ways of introducing gauge symmetry .",
    "one way is via chan - paton factors putting charges , called quarks , on the ends of the open string .",
    "the other way is using current algebras when the charge is distributed along the string . at the source of the second possibility",
    "is the effect of gauge symmetry enhancement emerging at special compactification radii .",
    "the simplest example of this kind of compactification is the bosonic string compactified on a circle of the self - dual radius @xmath17 . in this case",
    "the massless spectrum contains additional states forming @xmath18 multiplets .",
    "more precisely in the closed string case we have gauge bosons living in the uncompactified 25 dimensions and a @xmath19 multiplet of massless scalars .",
    "the @xmath18 symmetry is exhibited by the world - sheet currents @xmath20 and their antiholomorphic counterparts .    for open strings",
    "there are no @xmath8 gauge bosons in the spectrum but there is an @xmath8 triplet of massless scalars .",
    "this means that we have only global @xmath8 symmetry in space - time . before we write down the corresponding currents",
    "let us introduce some notations and fix the conventions .",
    "the open string mode expansion for the fields @xmath21 satisfying the neumann - neumann boundary conditions reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a spatial coordinate along the string and @xmath24 is minkowski world sheet time variable .",
    "the virasoro generators are @xmath25 where @xmath26 . here and everywhere below we set @xmath27 . by mapping this theory on the upper half plane with a complex coordinate @xmath28 we can further consider an equivalent chiral theory obtained by the standard doubling trick .",
    "namely , one defines @xmath29 in the lower half of @xmath30-plane as the value of @xmath31 at its image in the upper half plane under the reflection given by complex conjugation . this way we get @xmath32 chiral holomorphic fields @xmath33 ( by abuse of notation we will denote these fields by the same symbol @xmath34 ) with a mode expansion @xmath35 and the energy - momentum tensor of the standard form @xmath36",
    "the hilbert space of the open string compactified on the circle of self - dual radius in the @xmath37-direction furnishes a level one representation of an @xmath8 current algebra generated by @xmath38 we use the normal ordering convention in which the zero modes are also ordered : @xmath39 stands to the right of @xmath40 . in general",
    "it is known that the only level one ground state representations ( integrable in mathematics terminology ) of @xmath8 current algebra are those with spin @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "they both can be realized in terms of vertex operators ( [ su2 ] ) acting in the fock space of @xmath43 modes .",
    "the highest weight state for the singlet representation is the string @xmath44 vacuum @xmath45 , whereas the @xmath42 representation is built on the doublet of states @xmath46 .",
    "the representation spaces are spanned by the states @xmath47 where @xmath48 stand for the laurent modes of @xmath49 and @xmath50 stand for the vacuum vectors @xmath45 or @xmath51 .",
    "we will denote the corresponding representation spaces @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "then the hilbert space of the compactified string states that we have at hand coincides with @xmath52 .",
    "let us put @xmath15 chan - paton factors on one end of our string ( say at @xmath54 ) .",
    "then we obtain a total global symmetry group isomorphic to @xmath55 .",
    "the chan - paton degrees of freedom can be coupled to the local @xmath8 currents at @xmath54 .",
    "namely we can consider a background characterized by the following ( total ) stress energy tensor @xmath56 where @xmath57 are matrices of the fundamental representation of @xmath8 acting in a two - dimensional complex vector space @xmath58 of the chan - paton degrees of freedom ;",
    "@xmath59 is a coupling constant .",
    "this background breaks the symmetry group down to @xmath60 .",
    "note that the conformal dimension of the perturbation term in ( [ t ] ) is 1 so formally we are dealing with a marginal perturbation .",
    "however it turns out not to be truly marginal .",
    "one can show that the coupling constant @xmath59 starts to run at higher orders of perturbation theory .",
    "this is in contrast with the model considered in papers @xcite , @xcite in which one couples only the @xmath61 subgroup generated by the current @xmath62 to an end of the string .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , @xcite the perturbed theory is conformal for any value of the coupling constant .",
    "the hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of @xmath37 can be rewritten solely in terms of the @xmath8 currents as @xmath63 at the special point @xmath64 we can rewrite the hamiltonian as @xmath65 where we dropped an infinite additive constant .",
    "we see that at this point the conformal symmetry is restored and is given by the current algebra with generators @xmath66 .",
    "note that the operators @xmath67 generate the global ( on the world sheet ) part of the surviving symmetry group @xmath68 .",
    "the hypothesis is that the renormalization group flow brings the theory to this conformal point . assuming this we can further investigate what happens to the physical state space of the theory .",
    "let us show how to construct a highest weight state of the current algebra generated by @xmath69 s within the original hilbert space @xmath70 that is the string oscillator space tensored with the representation space of chan - paton degrees of freedom .",
    "the last one is spanned by two fermions denoted @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath73 is diagonalized in this basis .",
    "the @xmath69 highest weight state can be written as    @xmath74    where the operator in the brackets acts on a highest weight state @xmath75 of the current algebra generated by @xmath48 s .",
    "when we omit the vector index of @xmath34 we refer to the compactified direction @xmath37 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a notation @xmath76 we will refer to this expression as a singlet ( or screening ) operator . for the term `` operator '' to make sense one should consider @xmath77 to be acting from the fock space @xmath78 of the modes @xmath43 to @xmath79 .",
    "it is not hard to check that the operator @xmath80 satisfies the following important relation @xmath81 this relation makes it obvious that the construction ( [ hw ] ) indeed gives a @xmath69 current algebra highest weight state .",
    "the question now is what state @xmath75 should we take if the original hilbert space @xmath70 was built on the string vacuum @xmath45 ?",
    "note that the original hilbert space contains states whose momenta are quantized as @xmath82 , @xmath83 that corresponds to integer values of the isospin projection . whereas the operator in ( [ hw ] ) contains factors of @xmath84 shifting the momenta by @xmath85 and isospin projections by @xmath86 .",
    "assuming that the renormalization group flow can not change the moding of momenta the only possibility we arrive at is taking for @xmath50 the @xmath42 highest weight state .",
    "then the momenta of the representation space built on @xmath87 is quantized as before , although the @xmath88 algebra isospin is quantized in half integers . strictly speaking as the states ( [ hw ] ) have an infinite norm we can not argue that we stay exactly in the old hilbert space .",
    "so the above assumption is more a conjecture than a rigorous result .",
    "it is of the same nature as the assumptions on the rg flow in the kondo model , which seem to be thoroughly tested ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the new physical state space of the string is thus built on the doublet of states @xmath89 with this notation in mind",
    "the above assumption is that the rg flow acts inside @xmath79 and maps the two - dimensional subspace @xmath90 to the subspace spanned by @xmath91 .",
    "now we can calculate the new spectrum .",
    "the energies are lifted by the eigenvalue of @xmath92 evaluated on the new vacuum states @xmath93 . since the hamiltonian ( [ sug ] ) is given by the standard sugawara construction the energy shift is determined by the value of the casimir operator for the @xmath8 fundamental representation .",
    "the shift in the masses squared comes out to be equal to @xmath86 versus the tachyon mass squared being @xmath94 .",
    "( below we will see that for some of the more general compactifications the tachyon mass can get lifted all the way up to the zero value . )",
    "thus the lowest energy state is tachyonic with the mass squared @xmath95 and forms a doublet under @xmath68 .",
    "below we call the corresponding particle a quark",
    ". there are no massless states , the triplet of scalar states and the photon acquire mass squared of the value @xmath86 .",
    "moreover each of those states splits into an @xmath68 doublet because of the vacuum splitting .",
    "so far we have discussed the situation when only one end of the string is coupled to the background .",
    "it is not hard to modify the whole picture above to the case when both ends are coupled .",
    "we assume that the string is oriented and one end carries chan - paton degrees in the fundamental representation and another one in the antifundamental .",
    "the hamiltonian now takes the form @xmath96 where @xmath97 represent the @xmath8 algebra action on a two - dimensional space @xmath98 of the chan - paton degrees at the second end ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "this basis in @xmath98 will be denoted by @xmath100 . by locality argument",
    "we assume that the theory flows to the conformal point @xmath101 at which the energy - momentum tensor is given by the sugawara construction corresponding to the currents @xmath102 .",
    "the construction ( [ hw ] ) of highest weight states generalizes in a straightforward manner @xmath103 where @xmath104 we see that now the expression @xmath105 that acts on the `` old '' highest weight state @xmath50 contains the allowed momenta @xmath82 and thus one should choose @xmath106 .",
    "as far as the whole representation space of the current algebra @xmath69 is concerned we believe that is the correct assumption . however , since the `` screening '' of quarks by the @xmath37-modes takes place locally at each end , the old vacuum subspace state @xmath107 should flow to a subspace that is a tensor product in some sense of the vacuum subspaces at each end of the string .",
    "the last one splits into a sum of a singlet and a triplet representation .",
    "more precisely the four - dimensional subspace @xmath107 should flow to a subspace spanned by the highest weight state @xmath108 and descendant states @xmath109 the above three states form a zero mass triplet representation of the global @xmath68 symmetry group .",
    "the last one is generated by operators @xmath67 .",
    "we conclude that in the case when both boundaries are coupled to the background the spectrum of the theory at the fixed point stays the same as that of the original free theory .",
    "this agrees with the results of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us discuss now a possible space - time interpretation of the resulting model .",
    "first note that since we switched on a boundary perturbation the bulk central charge remains the same , @xmath110 , in the course of the rg flow ( otherwise we would be in trouble with string theory applications ) .",
    "moreover , the resulting cft should be describable as a free theory supplied with new conformally invariant boundary conditions .",
    "as we have seen the sole effect of the flow in a sector with only one boundary coupled to the background is in the shift of zero mode of momentum .",
    "this can be accounted for by switching on a @xmath61 wilson line with the value @xmath111 .",
    "then on the t - dual circle we have a system of two d24 branes , call them `` i '' and `` ii '' , that seat at opposite points on the circle . the i - ii sector of the dd boundary conditions then corresponds to the `` one boundary sector '' of our theory with the vacuum space spanned by @xmath91 states ( [ pm ] ) .",
    "the degeneracy of the new vacuum corresponds to the two homotopically nonequivalent paths of minimal lengths between the positions of the two d24-branes ( two semi - circles ) .",
    "the unshifted i - i and ii - ii sectors can be matched with the `` two boundary '' sector having the vacuum @xmath112 and with the original fock space of the compactified states built on @xmath45 .",
    "the last one can be thought of as a sector carrying trivial @xmath61 chan - paton factors on both ends .",
    "( as we will see in the next section , once we introduce a one boundary sector in consideration both the two boundary and the trivial chan - paton s sectors need to be added not to violate the unitarity . )",
    "in this section we will discuss the vertex operators for the two cases considered above , i.e. when only one boundary carries chan - paton factors and when both ends carry them .",
    "we begin with a construction of the @xmath8 current algebra vertex operators creating the states @xmath93 in the `` one boundary '' sector .",
    "this vertex operators can be written as @xmath113 this construction becomes almost obvious when rewritten with a help of the singlet operator @xmath77 @xmath114    the vertex operator ( [ v ] ) can be thought of as an operator creating a quark in a doublet representation out of an isospin zero state .",
    "the opposite process is governed by the vertex operator @xmath115 it can be also written as @xmath116 where @xmath117 we will refer to the vertex operator ( [ v ] ) as a quark vertex operator and to ( [ v ] ) as an antiquark one .",
    "we can calculate a four - quark tree level amplitude with these vertices .",
    "up to cyclic permutations there is a single tree level process .",
    "it can be represented by the following diagram    where the solid line denotes the quark boundary and the dashed line is for a nonquark boundary ( singlet state ) .",
    "the correlation function corresponding to this process is @xmath118 where the indices @xmath119 are each @xmath120 or @xmath121 .",
    "the minus signs in front of @xmath119 in ( [ 4pt ] ) are inserted so that the isospins of the incoming quarks ( that are opposite of those for the antiquarks ) are precisely the values of @xmath119 .",
    "the internal momenta carried by the quarks are @xmath122 .",
    "the vertex operators can be expressed as @xmath123 , @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "using these expressions and ( [ pm ] ) we can rewrite ( [ 4pt ] ) as @xmath126 this expression is divergent and the source of divergence is the infinite norm of states @xmath91 coming from contractions of @xmath127 with itself . to make sense of expression ( [ 4pt ] )",
    "we will employ a mode cutting regularization in which the operators of the form @xmath128 are regularized as @xmath129 the product of regularized operators @xmath130 and @xmath131 takes the form @xmath132 where @xmath133 is a constant that tends to infinity as @xmath134 . after contracting the chan - paton factors in the above expression we end up with the formula @xmath135 that is the regularized product of these two operators is proportional to the identity operator . using this result in the regularized expression ( [ 4pt ] ) , rescaling the whole correlator by @xmath136 ( that effectively normalizes the states @xmath91 ) we obtain after sending @xmath137 to infinity the following simple result @xmath138 that is just a correlation function of `` old '' vertex operators calculated for the states of nonzero momenta @xmath139 .",
    "this result illustrates best that the sole effect of the rg flow is the shift in the vacuum momenta , i.e. the shift of the zero modes of @xmath140 .",
    "the tree level four - quark amplitude @xmath141 depends on the isospin projections @xmath119 of the incoming quarks and on the energy - momentum vectors @xmath142 , @xmath143 in the transverse @xmath144 directions . depending on the values of @xmath119 we get three possible types of amplitudes @xmath145 : @xmath146 where @xmath147 , @xmath148 .",
    "evidently these amplitudes satisfy the duality relations @xmath149 , @xmath150 .",
    "the total tree level amplitude is obtained by summing up over all noncyclic permutations over the external states @xmath151 .",
    "it is clear from the picture that different factorizations of the process represented on figure 1 will contain as intermediate states strings with quarks running on two boundaries as well as strings with no quarks on either end .",
    "thus , there should be vertex operators emitting `` two boundary strings '' ( strings carrying chan - paton factors on both ends ) from the `` one boundary '' strings .",
    "we should think of three different sectors of the same theory rather than of the three isolated cases . by three sectors",
    "we mean `` one boundary strings '' , `` two boundary strings '' , and strings with no chan - paton degrees of freedom ( except for trivial @xmath61 factors ) on either end .",
    "the lowest state of the first sector is a quark whose mass is tachyonic , and the rest of the states are all massive @xmath68 doublets .",
    "the other two sectors have identical spectra , containing the usual tachyon , triplet of massless scalars ( a meson ) and a photon .",
    "we start by constructing meson ( quark - quark ) vertex operators .",
    "these operators should create strings with quarks running on both boundaries .",
    "the corresponding diagram of a four - meson scattering looks like that depicted on figure 1 with all solid line boundaries .",
    "it follows from the results of the previous section that a general physical state in the case when both ends of the string carry chan - paton degrees of freedom has a form @xmath152 where @xmath153 is a physical state in the `` old '' fock space .",
    "thus , we see that the vertex operators we are looking for should satisfy @xmath154 they create a massless particle in the adjoint representation of @xmath8 to which we will refer as a meson .",
    "if we are looking for a vertex operator that emits a meson from the boundary @xmath54 we can omit the operator @xmath155 from the above formulas .",
    "looking at formula ( [ relation ] ) we see that the modes @xmath69 satisfy the necessary relation .",
    "however the local operator with these modes is singular , it contains a delta function . to obtain a regularized version of @xmath156 we may start with the following formal expression @xmath157 one way of obtaining this expression",
    "is by fusing the vertices @xmath158 , @xmath159 we obtained before . to be careful one has to fuse the regularized vertices and keep all terms in the regularized expression after the fusion .",
    "another , much more practical way to make sense of the expression ( [ mesonv ] ) is by defining its action on a general physical state @xmath160 . in the expression",
    "@xmath161 we may start by regularizing @xmath162 as in ( [ mode_cut ] ) and then use ( [ ssreg ] ) .",
    "we see that after a proper rescaling the regulated vertex satisfies [ ssvop ] .    in order to calculate an @xmath163-point meson scattering amplitude we regularize the correlator by cutting the modes as @xmath164 now formula ( [ ssreg ] )",
    "can be applied to each factor @xmath165 that results in an overall divergent numerical factor .",
    "after rescaling and taking the limit @xmath134 we obtain that the contribution of the compactified modes boils down to a correlator of currents @xmath166 that can be easily evaluated by algebraic methods .",
    "note that in the above discussion for brevity we omitted the operators @xmath167 present in the `` two boundary '' string states .",
    "contractions between @xmath77 and @xmath167 lead to trivial constant factors . the derivation above can be modified to include operators @xmath167 in a straightforward way .",
    "the result is the same .",
    "all other amplitudes can be calculated in the same fashion .",
    "for example two quarks - two mesons amplitude contains a correlator @xmath168 where @xmath169 and @xmath170 are @xmath171 according to quark isospin projections .",
    "after regularization and rescaling we have @xmath172 we see that whenever we have states in the `` one boundary '' sector we should include a zero momentum shift for the compactified mode . with the above examples in mind constructions of all other possible amplitudes",
    "should be quite clear .",
    "next we would like to discuss the compactification of two dimensions on circles each having the self - dual radius .",
    "obviously in this case we obtain an @xmath16 current algebra .",
    "take the representation @xmath57 to be a @xmath173-representation .",
    "it is clear then how to extend our considerations for a single @xmath8 to the case at hand .",

    "the ground energy shift amounts to shifting the tachyon mass squared by 1 unit up .",
    "it is instructive to recast the construction of a new highest weight state in terms of free fermions .",
    "the @xmath16 current algebra is isomorphic to the @xmath10 current algebra and the whole picture above can be represented in terms of 4 chiral neveu - schwarz ( ns ) fermions @xmath181 .",
    "the chan - paton factors @xmath182 , @xmath183 transform in a vector representation .",
    "the @xmath10 currents have the form @xmath184 the mode expansion for @xmath181 reads @xmath185 and the fock vacuum is defined as @xmath186 .",
    "the whole fock space splits into a direct sum of two irreducible representations of the current algebra ( [ so4 ] ) .",
    "the subspace of even fermion number corresponds to the singlet representation and the odd fermion number subspace is built on a vacuum space spanned by the vectors @xmath187 transforming in a vector representation of @xmath10 . notice that in ( 21 ) we have chosen half integer moded ns fermions rather than integer moded ramond fermions",
    "the reason for this is that the even fermion sector of ns fermions corresponds to integer moding of the bosonic @xmath188 and @xmath37 momenta , which is required by the self dual radius compactification .",
    "in contrast , r fermions correspond to half integer moding of the bosonic momenta . the highest weight state construction ( [ so4hw ] ) in the fermionic language reads as @xmath189 and staying in the same representation space requires the choice @xmath190 .",
    "let us consider now a more interesting situation that is directly related to the kondo model .",
    "consider again the compactification on two circles of self - dual radii .",
    "but instead of coupling the whole @xmath191 to the chan - paton factors let us couple now only one of the @xmath8 subalgebras .",
    "( the subscripts @xmath192 and @xmath193 is just a convention here distinguishing two copies of @xmath8 s . )",
    "the answer for the resulting flow is of course the same as the one we considered before for the one direction compactified .",

    "currents of @xmath199 chosen in a cartan basis are @xmath200 the operator @xmath201 , where zero refers to the laurent mode , is just one half of the charge operator .",
    "we thus start with a perturbed stress energy tensor @xmath202 this formula gives precisely the kondo model stress - energy in the holomorphic representation . in terms of the currents we have @xmath203",
    "i.e. we have the sugawara construction for the group @xmath15 and the old perturbation term that involves only the @xmath8 subgroup .",
    "we can work out now the new highest weight state in terms of fermion modes and the @xmath204 states .",
    "the mode expansions for @xmath205 and @xmath206 are of the form @xmath207 and commutation relations are @xmath208 the standard vacuum state @xmath45 in the fock space @xmath209 is defined as @xmath210 we can construct now two @xmath196 singlet operators @xmath211 if the hilbert state we begin with has states of even fermion number only ( that would be the case if we are interested in the string theory application ) then we have four possible doublets of @xmath196 @xmath212 however , the second @xmath8 permutes these multiplets .",
    "the true vacuum subspace should be invariant under @xmath199 .",
    "it is not hard to find that the correct vacuum space is a single @xmath196 doublet spanned by @xmath213 hence , we see that the vacuum subspace transforms now in a chiral spinor representation of the whole @xmath10 group .",
    "also the moding of the new isospin operator @xmath214 got shifted by @xmath86 .",
    "this means that the new representation space is described in terms of free ramond fermions .",
    "this fits perfectly with the general expectation that the boundary rg flow results only in a change of boundary conditions for the fields .",
    "conversely , suppose one starts with a hilbert space with odd fermion number .",
    "( although we do not see a string theory setup for this situation , it naturally arises in the kondo model ) .",
    "we are forced then to start with a four - dimensional vacuum space spanned by @xmath215 , @xmath216 .",
    "the new vacuum subspace then is invariant under @xmath196 and is a doublet with respect to @xmath199 .",
    "it is spanned by @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "( as we started from a four - dimensional vacuum space times a two - dimensional chan - paton space and ended up with a two - dimensional vacuum , presumably the rest of the states flow to descendants . )",
    "again we end up with ramond fermions . two conformal towers , that of @xmath196 and @xmath199 being originally glued as @xmath219 get reshuffled after the flow resulting in @xmath220 these results regarding the kondo model are originally due to affleck @xcite , we just discuss them here from a somewhat different point of view .",
    "in this section we consider @xmath163-dimensional compactification on maximal tori of @xmath221 groups and discuss other possible setups .",
    "we refer the reader to paper @xcite for a review of the standard material about vertex operator constructions that we use in this section .",
    "we start with a discussion of @xmath221 groups and chan - paton degrees in the vector representation .",
    "let @xmath222 , @xmath223 be a standard ortonormal basis in @xmath224 and let @xmath225 be @xmath221 root lattice generated by the roots @xmath226 , @xmath227 .",
    "( in this section we will stick to the normalization in which the simple roots have length @xmath228 . )",
    "consider a level one representation of the @xmath221 current algebra by means of the vertex operator construction : @xmath229 where @xmath230 runs from @xmath231 to @xmath163 , @xmath232 are positive roots , @xmath233 are klein cocycle factors .",
    "the laurent modes of @xmath234 give us the ladder operators @xmath235 corresponding to roots and the modes @xmath236 are cartan operators of our current algebra .",
    "the possible momenta in the fock space of modes @xmath237 , @xmath238 are constrained to lie in the weight lattice @xmath239 . for the groups",
    "@xmath221 the weight lattice contains four cosets @xmath240 : @xmath241 where @xmath242 , @xmath243 and @xmath244 are the three minimal weights of @xmath221 corresponding to the vector , spinor and conjugate spinor representations ( @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 ) respectively .",
    "these cosets give rise to four possible highest weight representations of @xmath221 current algebra built on the highest weight states @xmath45 - the fock vacuum , @xmath248 where @xmath249 .",
    "proceeding as before we couple the currents ( [ so(n ) ] ) at one end of the string to the chan - paton degrees of freedom transforming in a vector representation of @xmath221 .",
    "the perturbed stress energy tensor expressed in terms of the currents reads @xmath250 where @xmath251 , @xmath252 are matrices of the @xmath221 defining ( vector ) representation written in a cartan basis . at the point @xmath253",
    "one can complete the square and get a sugawara construction with the new @xmath221 currrent algebra generators having modes @xmath254 , @xmath255 .",
    "the singlet operator has now the form @xmath256 where @xmath257 are chan - paton factors transforming in the vector representation .",
    "also note that the operators @xmath258 have the momenta corresponding to fundamental weights of the vector representation . in order to stay in the same hilbert space after the rg flow we have to ensure that the momenta entering the new highest weight state are all in the root lattice @xmath259 .",
    "this condition is satisfied if one takes latexmath:[\\[\\label{newhw }    chooses @xmath50 corresponding to the vector representation .",
    "it is not hard to calculate the energy shift ( see the general formula ( [ shift ] ) below ) . for all @xmath163 s we have @xmath261 which means that the tachyon mass squared gets shifted half way up , i.e. from @xmath94 to @xmath262 . in the case",
    "when both boundaries carry chan - paton indices one would expect a complete lift of the tachyon mass .",
    "however , as it was already discussed in the @xmath8 case , the lifted states are descendants and the true vacuum ( that will inevitably show up in other scattering channels ) is tachyonic .",
    "in fact for the `` two boundary '' states the spectrum is the same as that of the original theory .    the construction of the singlet operator ( [ singletop ] ) and the new highest weight state ( [ newhw ] ) generalizes straightforwardly to the case of arbitrary simply - laced simple lie algebra .",
    "if we set aside for a moment the consistency conditions coming from string theory we have the following general pattern .",
    "let @xmath263 be a simply laced simple lie algebra .",
    "choose a minimal fundamental weight such that the corresponding highest weight representation of @xmath263 gives rise to an integrable representation of the current algebra .",
    "let @xmath264 be the fundamental weights of this representation .",
    "assume also that the chan - paton factors transform in the conjugated representation .",
    "we then write a singlet operator as @xmath265 one should choose a suitable minimal representation with weights @xmath266 of @xmath263 for @xmath50 so that the sums @xmath267 all belong to the root lattice .",
    "as it is well known ( see for example @xcite ) there is a correspondence between @xmath268 - the center of the universal covering group whose lie algebra is the compact real form of @xmath263 , the factor group @xmath269 and the cominimal weights of @xmath263 plus the zero weight ( a fundamental weight is called minimal if its dual coxeter label is one , and is called cominimal if its coxeter label is one ; see @xcite ) .",
    "this correspondence holds even for non simply - laced groups .",
    "thus , we see that the cosets of @xmath270 and @xmath264 should represent inverse elements in the group @xmath268",
    ". the construction of the vacuum subspace in the two boundary sector should satisfy the same requirement of having momenta in the root lattice . again",
    "the choice of the new minimal weight can be deduced from the structure of the group @xmath271 .",
    "the ground energy shift can be expressed via values of quadratic casimir operators as @xmath272 where @xmath273 and @xmath274 are the values of the quadratic casimir for the adjoint representation and the representation in which the chan - paton degrees of freedom transform .    for the remaining cases of simply laced groups and minimal representations",
    "there is of course a usual question of weather the chan - paton degrees are introduced correctly , i.e. in a way consistent with unitarity and factorization of amplitudes .",
    "it is well known ( @xcite ) that chan - paton degrees of freedom can be introduced consistently only for the groups @xmath275 , @xmath276 and @xmath277 and chan - paton indices in defining representation .",
    "note however that the usual restrictions come from considerations of the two boundary sector and in the case at hand the chan - paton degrees get completely absorbed into the new vacuum , i.e. they enter only in @xmath77 and @xmath167 combinations .",
    "so we do not think that the usual factorization arguments are applicable in our situation .",
    "thus , in principle we can consider more general setups and representations .",
    "as an example consider now @xmath221 groups with chan - paton indices in the spinor representation @xmath278 .",
    "the center @xmath279 is isomorphic to the group @xmath280 when @xmath163 is odd and to @xmath281 when @xmath163 is even .",
    "let us first consider the case of even @xmath163 s . if @xmath282 , @xmath283 are fundamental weights of the conjugated spinor representation @xmath284 then we have @xmath285 the resulting energy shift can be calculated by formula ( [ shift ] ) and is equal to @xmath286 thus , for @xmath10 we get the familiar @xmath287 shift , for @xmath12 the tachyon mass gets lifted all the way up to zero and for @xmath9 it becomes massive .",
    "all states split into a spinor multiplets .",
    "so much for the one boundary sector . when we couple both boundaries we have chan - paton factors @xmath288 transforming in the @xmath278 representation running on one end and @xmath289 in the @xmath284 representation on another end .",
    "to satisfy our usual requirement of having all momenta in the root lattice we have to choose the vector representation for the new highest weight state : @xmath290 and the energy shift in the two boundary sector is @xmath86 . to summarize we",
    "obtain hilbert spaces built using all of the four minimal representations : @xmath278 and @xmath284 in the one boundary sector , @xmath291 in the two boundary sector and the singlet representation in the sector with trivial chan - paton indices on both ends .",
    "the considerations for the groups @xmath221 with odd @xmath163 are parallel to the ones made above .",
    "one should only take into account that @xmath292 + [ \\lambda_{\\bar s } ] = [ 0]$ ] in the group @xmath293 where square brackets stand for the corresponding cosets .",
    "thus , we have the same shifts in the one boundary sectors ( the only difference is that chan - paton factors coupled to the boundary have the same chirality as the resulting highest weight representation versus the opposite situation for even @xmath163 s ) .",
    "in the two boundary sector carrying chan - paton factors of opposite chirality on the two ends we have no lift in the ground state energy .",
    "note that in principle one can also consider two boundary sectors having chan - paton factors of the same chirality on both ends .",
    "the corresponding energy shifts are always given by either formula ( [ vect_shift ] ) or ( [ spin_shift ] ) .",
    "let us make here a remark about fermionization .",
    "for the case of the vector representation of @xmath276 there is an equivalent picture of the flow in the fock space of @xmath163 real ns fermions . for the spinor representation",
    "although we do not know if there is a simple picture of the flow that stays inside the fock space of the vectorial ns fermions ( except for the @xmath10 case considered above ) we can always interpret the flow as a change from ns to r boundary conditions . for the group @xmath11 due to the famous triality property one can alternatively recast everything in terms of spinorial fermions with ns boundary conditions @xcite . in that case , if we start with the even fermion number subspace in the corresponding fock space , then we flow in that subspace times the chan - paton factors and the final result is equivalent to the odd fermion number subspace in the fock space .",
    "let us now turn to the case of @xmath13 groups .",
    "the center in this case is isomorphic to @xmath294 .",
    "this means that the group of cosets @xmath240 is cyclic , generated by the coset corresponding to the highest weight of the fundamental representation .",
    "all of the elements of @xmath294 give rise to some highest weight representation of @xmath13 current algebra .",
    "the construction of the new highest weight states follows the general pattern discussed above and we will work out explicitly only the @xmath14 case .",
    "let us label the chan - paton factors by the minimal representations : @xmath295 , @xmath296 .",
    "then one has two types of singlet operators , @xmath297 and @xmath298 resulting after fusing these factors with the twist operators @xmath299 of the conjugated representations .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a trivial singlet operator @xmath300 that corresponds to the boundary carrying trivial chan - paton factors .",
    "then , we have nine sectors in the theory ( nine boundary conditions ) the vacuum subspaces of which are constructed by using the combinations @xmath301 where @xmath302 . more explicitly we have @xmath303 are weights of the minimal representation @xmath304",
    "such that the corresponding cosets in @xmath240 satisfy @xmath305 + [ \\lambda^{b } ] + [ \\lambda^{c } ] = 0 $ ] . as usual the tilted quantities refer to the @xmath99 end of the string and the untilted ones to @xmath306 .",
    "the sectors corresponding to @xmath307 , @xmath308 , and @xmath309 have the old , unshifted energy spectrum , whereas other sectors give rise to triplets of vacuum states and momenta shifted by @xmath310 .",
    "these shifts can be accounted for by switching on the appropriate wilson lines on the torus @xmath311 .",
    "the picture becomes more transparent on the t - dual torus @xmath312 .",
    "let us put three distinct @xmath313 branes on the points corresponding to the positions of the minimal ( and zero ) weights : @xmath314 written in the root basis . oriented strings with dd boundary conditions stretching between these branes fall into nine distinct sectors that can be matched with the spectra of above representations @xmath315 if we adopt a rule that strings stretching from the brane marked by the highest weight @xmath316 to the one marked by @xmath317 correspond to the combination of a pair of singlet operators with @xmath318 , @xmath319 .",
    "this rule is quite natural if one looks at the momenta carried by the states @xmath315 .",
    "the triple degeneracy of the shifted vacuum states corresponds to three homotopically inequivalent paths of minimal length stretching between each pair of distinct branes .",
    "this results from the peculiar positions of the branes that actually seat at the fixed points of @xmath320 action , defined on the roots @xmath321 , @xmath322 as @xmath323 , @xmath324 .",
    "we have considered above various setups in which the open string vacuum state is probed by various almost marginal boundary perturbations of the world sheet cft .",
    "the resulting rg flow brings the theory to a nontrivial ir fixed point .",
    "theories at the fixed point all possess new instabilities of the tachyon type .",
    "the situation is similar to the partial tachyon condensation through creation of lower dimensional branes considered in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we would like to propose here a possible brane interpretation of the rg flows we considered .",
    "first note that for the two boundary sector that can be considered by itself , the initial system in the case of compactification on @xmath325 maximal torus with @xmath326 chan - paton factors added is just a system of @xmath137 d25 branes wrapped on the corresponding torus .",
    "after the flow the chan - paton factors are completely absorbed , the new vacuum is nondegenerate and the spectrum is the same as for a single d25 brane .",
    "this suggests that the boundary rg flow at hand describes some sort of a merging of @xmath137 d25 branes into a single d25 brane .",
    "one can also try to interpret the sectors with different chan - paton factors on two ends in terms of systems of d - branes .",
    "for example in the @xmath8 case before switching on the boundary perturbation we can consider a system of a single d25 brane and two dp - branes , @xmath327 on top of each other wrapped on the circle of self - dual radius ( for @xmath328 one can easily modify the considerations above by imposing the appropriate boundary conditions on the string coordinates transversal to the circle ) .",
    "the sector with @xmath61 chan - paton factors on one end and with @xmath15 on another then corresponds to strings stretched between the d25 brane and the two dp - branes .",
    "after switching on the background on the two dp - branes the system flows to a configuration that in the t - dual picture can be described as a single d24 brane and a single d(p-1)-brane sitting at the radially symmetric points on the circle .    in the case of @xmath14 group at the end point of the flow we also arrive at a very symmetric configuration of the branes that are located at the fixed points of a @xmath329 orbifold .",
    "the connections of the boundary flows we consider with orbifolds need to be better understood .",
    "as was already pointed out in the introduction the process of tachyon condensation causes the reduction of open strings degrees of freedom .",
    "formally the number of boundary degrees of freedom in bcft can be measured by boundary entropy @xmath59 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath59 for @xmath110 conformal field theories with dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions were calculated in @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to calculate explicitly and compare the boundary entropies for the initial and the end points of the rg flows that we considered .",
    "finally let us mention possible connections with superstring theories .",
    "one can speculate that the bosonic string theory is dynamically driven by tachyon condensation process to some supersymmetric theory or a fermionic theory related to a supersymmetric one . in the case of @xmath9 theory the flow from ns to r fermions shows a possible way of how various sectors in the spectrum of type i or heterotic superstring theories can be dynamically generated in the bosonic string .",
    "one can try more sophisticated schemes by using @xmath12 or @xmath11 subgroups and coupling them to various chan - paton factors .",
    "we leave these questions for a future investigation .",
