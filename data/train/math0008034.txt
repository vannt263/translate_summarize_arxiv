    "fusion coefficients first appeared in the literature as the structure constants of the verlinde ( fusion ) algebra associated to an affine kac - moody algebra @xmath2 in the wess - zumino - witten model of conformal field theory .",
    "since then , many equivalent interpretations have been found in other contexts such as quantum groups and hecke algebras at root of unity  @xcite , quantum cohomology of the grassmannian  @xcite , spaces of generalized theta functions , spaces of intertwiners in vertex operator algebras  @xcite , knot invariants for 3-manifolds  @xcite and others .",
    "if @xmath3 is a semi - simple finite dimensional lie algebra and @xmath4 is the integrable representation of @xmath3 with highest weight @xmath5 , the tensor product coefficients @xmath6 are defined by the relation @xmath7 . for @xmath8",
    "the integrable representations are indexed by partitions and the tensor product coefficients are the well - known littlewood - richardson coefficients @xmath9 . given a positive level @xmath1 , the fusion coefficients @xmath10",
    "are defined by @xmath11 where the fusion product @xmath12 is the reduction of the tensor product via the representation at level @xmath1 of the algebra @xmath2 . a more detailed approach to fusion coefficients arising in conformal field theory",
    "is given in  @xcite .",
    "for our purposes we will give in section 3 an equivalent definition for the case @xmath8 .    by some representation theoretic arguments",
    "it is known that these coefficients are non - negative but a general combinatorial description is still lacking even for type @xmath13 . only some particular cases are known : the cases @xmath14 and @xmath15  @xcite where the combinatorial objects used are the berenstein - zelevinski triangles , and more recently the case where all partitions in the product are rectangles  @xcite in which affine crystal theory for perfect crystals was used .",
    "in addition , a @xmath16-analogue of fusion coefficients has also been introduced  @xcite .    to date , the most effective algorithm for computing fusion coefficients for any type is the kac - walton algorithm  @xcite . in this algorithm ,",
    "the fusion coefficients are expressed in terms of the tensor product coefficients @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the affine weyl group , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the set of dominant weights and @xmath21 is the sum of fundamental weights . in this notation",
    "the affine weyl groups are isomorphic , and only the action of the reflection @xmath22 on the weight lattice of the algebra @xmath2 is different with respect to the level @xmath1 i.e. @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the highest root of @xmath3 , @xmath25 are the simple roots , and @xmath26 is the symmetric billinear form on the cartan subalgebra of @xmath27 .    in this paper",
    "we use the interpretation given by goodman and wenzl  @xcite to give a combinatorial description for @xmath0 fusion coefficients where the partition @xmath28 has two columns .",
    "our main result is theorem 12 where we show that the fusion coefficients count paths in the young s lattice with some extra conditions .",
    "an equivalent interpretation in terms of littlewood - richardson tableaux is given in remark 13 .",
    "the tool for finding this description is the pairing technique for proving the classical littlewood - richardson rule by means of a sign - reversing involution .",
    "therefore we include in section 2 a proof of the classical rule so that in section 3 we can construct the involution for fusion coefficients . in section 4",
    "we establish some interesting properties of these coefficients in our specific case .",
    "some of these confirm known properties such as positivity and the inequality @xmath29 , but most importantly we confirm the increasing property as function of @xmath1 conjectured in  @xcite i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "we conclude our paper with section 5 where we propose another avenue for approaching the problem .",
    "the proof of the lr - rule is based on the jacobi - trudi determinantal identities and uses a sign reversing involution which yields a combinatorial characterization of the lr - coefficients in terms of paths in the young s lattice .",
    "the involution is an adaptation of the involution constructed by remmel and shimozono  @xcite .",
    "the lr - coefficients are the structure constants @xmath31 for the ring of symmetric polynomials with respect to the basis of schur functions : @xmath32    we intend to give a characterization of these coefficients of the form @xmath33    there are many ways of getting to this result depending on which determinantal formula we use",
    ". we shall choose the one expressing the schur functions in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials @xmath34 .",
    "the reason for this choice is accounted for in the proof of the rule for fusion coefficients .    in order to prove the lr - rule we first need some definitions .",
    "most of those not given here and results concerning symmetric functions that we use can be found in  @xcite . for a partition @xmath5",
    "we consider its diagram to be the set of points @xmath35 such that @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "we denote _ a path _ @xmath38 in the young s lattice from @xmath39 to @xmath40 by _ a chain of partitions _ @xmath41 where each partition @xmath42 differs from the previous one @xmath43 by exactly one box .",
    "we also denote by @xmath44 the length of the path @xmath38 .",
    "sometimes we need paths from @xmath5 to @xmath40 made from _ successive paths _",
    "i.e.  @xmath45 , where each @xmath46 is a path from @xmath47 to @xmath48 with @xmath49 , and @xmath50 denotes the concatenation of the paths .",

    "the next step is to construct a sign reversing involution on the set @xmath96 .",
    "the involution uses the crystal operators defined by a _ pairing _ and was constructed in  @xcite which also contains further details .",

    "we can identify the standard tableau with a path from @xmath471 to @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath162 partition in the path is obtained obtained from the previous one by adding the box indexed @xmath56 in the tableau @xmath470 .",
    "_ example : the tableau @xmath470=  0.15 in represents the path _",
    "@xmath472 we say that a standard tableau is _",
    "@xmath183-restricted _ if the associated path is @xmath183-restricted .",
    "we note that this definition is consistent with the definition of a column - strict restricted tableau .",
    "we denote by @xmath473 the number of @xmath183-restricted standard tableaux of shape @xmath5 .",
    "a future task is to find some sort of expression for these numbers .",
    "we have the following result .    for @xmath467 , partitions in @xmath186 we have @xmath474    * proof .",
    "*    first we prove by induction that @xmath475 we stress here that all equalities take place in the fusion algebra @xmath176 and all partitions involved are @xmath183-restricted .",
    "if @xmath476 the right hand side of equation  ( [ e ] ) is @xmath477 .",
    "assume that the equality is true for @xmath131 and we shall prove it for @xmath478",
    ". first observe @xmath479 to show that @xmath480 we note that each @xmath183-restricted standard tableau of shape @xmath28 determines a unique @xmath183-restricted standard tableau of shape @xmath40 by adding the corresponding box with the entry @xmath481 .",
    "this process is reversible since the box filled with @xmath481 , which is the largest number of the standard tableau , is an exterior corner of the shape @xmath40",
    ".    therefore we get that @xmath482 .",
    "now we proceed to prove equation  ( [ nice ] ) .",
    "if we multiply @xmath180 successively with @xmath483 in the fusion algebra we get @xmath484 using  ( [ e ] ) , the left - hand side of this equality becomes @xmath485 equating the coefficient of @xmath222 in the right - hand side of equation  ( [ f ] ) and the line above we get @xmath486 @xmath358    in view of the last equation one could hope to define fusion - knuth relations among the words of the restricted paths .",
    "this might happen since in the classical case , the knuth relations and equation  ( [ nan ] ) determine the littlewood - richardson coefficients as the number of equivalence classes . in a similar way , fusion coefficients would count equivalence classes under fusion - knuth relations .",
    "this , however , remains to be the subject of further investigation .",
    "i am indebted to nantel bergeron for constant guidance and advice throughout this work and terry gannon who first suggested the project and gave insights into fusion theory .",
    "i am also grateful to mark shimozono and stephanie van willigenburg for helpful comments ."
