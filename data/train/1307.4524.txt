    "in 1988 @xcite , aharonov et al . introduced the concept of postselected weak measurements , initiating a prolific avenue of research .",
    "recently , there have been several works considering the possibility of using weak and intermediate strength interaction in order to reconstruct an unknown quantum state @xcite and to diminish the noise in a variable by preceding its measurement with the observation of the conjugate variable @xcite .",
    "other works , instead , in line with the initial proposal of aharonov et al .",
    "@xcite , have focused on the amplification effect of weak measurement @xcite .",
    "( however , the actual advantage over techniques based on strong measurement has been questioned @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the provocative title of the original paper by aharonov et al . was `` how the result of a measurement of a component of the spin of a spin-1/2 particle can turn out to be 100 '' , meaning that the average output of a detector which , in a strong measurement , would give @xmath11 as outputs , can be amplified to @xmath12 if the measurement is weak and the system is suitably postselected .",
    "the weakness of the measurement means that initially the uncertainty over the pointer variable is much larger than @xmath5 , the distance between the peaks expected in the strong regime .",
    "this means that initially the pointer may not be in the zero position , but it could read , e.g. , @xmath13 or @xmath14 , etc . however , if the detector were a classical object , these fluctuations would cancel out on the average . instead ,",
    "as the detector obeys quantum mechanics as well , if it is prepared in a suitably quantum coherent superposition of pointer states @xcite and if the system is postselected appropriately , this cancellation does not occur , possibly leading to a large output .",
    "how large can the average output be ? according to the simple formula of ref .",
    "@xcite there are no bounds to the average output , but as it turns out , the formula breaks down when the output is largish .",
    "this has prompted the need to provide a more reliable formula , working also in the regime where the measurement strength is weak but the overlap between the preparation and the postselection is small @xcite .    for a spin 1/2 , it is possible to work out an exact solution for an instantaneous interaction @xcite and more generally for a nondemolition interaction of finite duration @xcite .",
    "this has allowed to study the maximization of the output based on the exact expression in ref .",
    "@xcite , and then in refs .",
    "@xcite with varying degrees of generality .",
    "@xcite considered some particular cases of the maximization for a detector with an infinite dimensional hilbert space performing a canonical von neumann measurement , i.e. using a position variable @xmath15 to couple with the system and its conjugate variable @xmath16 as the readout for the measurement .",
    "furthermore , ref .",
    "@xcite only considered pure preparation and postselection , so that there may be , in principle , higher maxima or lower minima for mixed preparation and postselection . during the completion of the present manuscript",
    ", a preprint appeared @xcite that treats the problem of the maximization of the output as well .",
    "the variational approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , does not allow , to determine for which values @xmath7 the maximization is attained , and it applies only when @xmath15 has a continuous spectrum and the readout @xmath16 is its conjugate variable . to the best of my knowledge",
    ", there is no systematic study of the maximization of an arbitrary output variable @xmath0 for higher - dimensional systems .",
    "the main result of this paper is provided in eqs .",
    ", , , and .",
    "as customary when treating weak measurements , it is supposed that a detector interacts with the measured system through the hamiltonian @xmath17 , i.e. the von neumann model @xcite of measurement is assumed . in this model ,",
    "the output variable is usually taken to be @xmath16 , the conjugate variable of @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath18=i$ ] , with @xmath19 $ ] the commutator .",
    "thus , @xmath15 is assumed to have a continuous unbounded spectrum , so that it can be treated as a position operator . in the following ,",
    "however , we shall not make this assumption , and in this sense we are diverging from the von neumann model .",
    "instead , we shall consider the output variable @xmath9 to be arbitrary .",
    "thus , the detector could have a finite - dimensional hilbert space , for instance it could be a spin 1/2 , with @xmath15 a spin component , etc .    before the interaction ,",
    "the measured system is prepared in a state @xmath2 and the detector in a state @xmath20 , so that the total state is @xmath21 for simplicity , in the following we shall consider @xmath2 and @xmath20 to be given at time @xmath22 , immediately before the interaction ( otherwise , one should trivially propagate the states forward in time with the non - interacting hamiltonian ) .",
    "the joint state after the interaction is thus @xmath23 after the system has interacted with the detector , the latter is observed , usually determining the value of @xmath24 . the system , on the other hand , is supposed to undergo another measurement yielding an output @xmath25 , to which a nonnegative operator @xmath26 is associated .",
    "when the value of this measurement coincides with some arbitrarily fixed value @xmath27 , the output @xmath24 of the detector is selected and analyzed separately .",
    "this procedure is known as postselection .",
    "the conditional state of the detector , given that the system is successfully postselected in the state @xmath3 , is then @xmath28 , \\label{eq : rhocond}\\ ] ] with the normalization being but the probability of successful postselection @xmath29 .",

    "hence , in order to give meaningful expressions for all possible preparations and postselections , one must retain the second - order terms .",
    "notice that we are departing from the nave taylor expansion , which prescribes that the propagator be expanded up to second order for consistency @xcite .",
    "see the appendix for a further discussion .",
    "the approximation is not to be taken as an operator equation , since @xmath15 may have an unbounded spectrum ; instead , eq .   must be interpreted as meaning that , when it is plugged into eqs .",
    "and , it yields a good approximation , provided that @xmath41 vanishes sufficiently fast for large @xmath42 .",
    "more precisely , we may give a sufficient condition : if @xmath43 with @xmath44 a small positive number , then we may apply eq .",

    "and the approximate value is @xmath47 , under some conjecture .. for instance , in ref .",

    "reference @xcite considers the canonical von neumann measurement , with @xmath50 the conjugated variable of @xmath15 , and , in addition to the hypothesis , it makes another assumption , namely that it is possible expand @xmath51 in a taylor series in @xmath5 , @xmath52 , \\label{eq : linappr}\\ ] ] with @xmath53 the canonical weak value and @xmath54 a positive real number , the second weak value . for brevity , we defined @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",

    "we consider a fixed preparation of the probe ( otherwise , it can be proved that there is no bound to the average output @xcite ) , and we look for an extremal value of @xmath85 as a function of the preparation @xmath2 and the postselection @xmath3 . in a @xmath86-dimensional hilbert space , these states are characterized by a total of @xmath87 real parameters ( we remind the readers that @xmath3 need not have trace one , but the weak values are invariant upon rescaling of @xmath3 , so that @xmath3 is effectively characterized by @xmath88 parameters , as @xmath2 ) .",
    "some of these parameters are superfluous .",
    "for instance , if we consider the unitary transformations that leave the observable @xmath1 invariant , @xmath89 , by changing @xmath3 to @xmath90 and @xmath2 to @xmath91 , the weak values remain the same . in the simplest case ( @xmath92 ) of @xmath1 representing a spin 1/2 ,",
    "the family @xmath93 is characterized by the rotations around the direction of @xmath1 , so that it is a one - parameter symmetry .",
    "the total number of real parameters is thus @xmath94 , and it grows with higher dimension @xmath86 ( we discard the trivial case @xmath95 ) .",

    "we recall that , in order to find the extrema of a function @xmath98 $ ] , with @xmath99 , one just needs to find the extrema of @xmath100 , simplifying the problem to the maximization of a function of less variables .",

    "the plane is described by the equation @xmath119 , so that it is parallel to the @xmath120-axis , and hence it certainly intercepts the paraboloid ( the case @xmath121 shall be treated separately )",
