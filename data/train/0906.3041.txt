    "the frame selection technique for high resolution imaging involves the recording of a time series of short exposure images and the selection of the sharpest images out of the series for alignment and combining into a final image .",
    "@xcite determined that the probability of obtaining a lucky sharp image ( defined as one with wavefront variance less than @xmath5 ) with a telescope of aperture @xmath6 in seeing described by a fried parameter @xmath7 @xcite is given by :    @xmath8\\ ] ]    this suggests that there will be more good quality images available at low @xmath0 .",
    "the probability of such an image is 1 in 9 for @xmath9 or 1 in 50 for @xmath10 . for higher @xmath0",
    "the probability of a sharp image rapidly decreases , being 1 in 3800 for @xmath11 .",
    "since the image quality gain will increase with @xmath0 this suggests the frame selection techique will work best for @xmath12 , this being the largest @xmath0 at which there is a good chance of finding several high quality images in a typical image sequence of a few thousand frames .",
    "there have been a number of practical demonstrations of this technique variously described as frame selection @xcite , lucky imaging @xcite , or selective image reconstruction @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the ability to obtain diffraction limited star images at 800 nm wavelength with a 2.5 m telescope .",
    "the technique has been used to image the hemisphere of mercury that was missed by mariner 10 @xcite and is now widely used by amateur astronomers for planetary imaging .",
    "interest in the technique is rapidly increasing , in part due to the availability of electron multiplying ccd ( emccd ) technology , which allows rapid readout of ccds with negligible read noise @xcite , as well as computers with fast processors and large storage capacity .",
    "a number of such systems have recently been demonstrated , for example luckycam @xcite , astralux @xcite and fastcam @xcite .    however , previous studies have generally been aimed at obtaining the best possible image resolution and have therefore explored a restricted range of parameters . in this paper",
    "we present observations that explore a wide range of parameter space .",
    "we have explored empirically the effects of telescope aperture @xmath6 , wavelength @xmath13 , frame exposure time @xmath14 and frame selection rate @xmath15 on the resulting image quality . unlike most previous studies which have aimed at exploiting excellent seeing conditions , our observations were obtained in a range of seeing conditions from good to poor .",
    "the results provide information that can help to optimize the design of future instruments .",
    "the observations were obtained using _ music _ mk i ( macquarie university selective imaging camera ) .",
    "the study was carried out as a preliminary stage in the design of a more advanced lucky imaging system that will use an electron multiplying ccd camera .",
    "the imager used for _ music _ was a watec 100n monochrome video camera .",
    "this camera was chosen because it had adjustable exposure times and adequate sensitivity to observe bright stars .",
    "the observations used standard bvri filters .",
    "the camera was placed either directly at the telescope focus , or when necessary used with a 2.5 times focal extender . in all cases",
    "the image scale was chosen to ensure that the pixels provided good sampling of diffraction limited star images .",
    "the camera produces video output with an effective pixel size of 8.6 by 8.3 @xmath16 m and a format of 768 by 576 pixels .",
    "the camera generates video data with interlaced scanning ( i.e. each frame consists of consecutive scans of odd rows and even rows stitched together ) .",
    "the video data was recorded using a data translation dt3155 pci frame grabber mounted in a pc system using a 3ghz pentium 4 processor .",
    "the pc was configured with 1 tb of disk space ( two 400 gb and one 200 gb drives ) to record the large data files .",
    "the operating system was fedora core linux .",
    "a data acquisition software system was developed that enabled data from the video camera to be recorded continuously as three dimensional fits files , while being displayed in real time .",
    "the software made use of c++ classes developed at the anglo - australian observatory for the iris2 project and aao2 detector controllers @xcite .",
    "the image display was based on the eso real time display ( rtd ) system @xcite .",
    "the system was capable of recording full frame video data to disk for extended periods .",
    "typical observations consisted of sequences of 3000 to 10000 video frames .",
    "_ music _ was used on three telescopes .",
    "the observing dates , locations and instruments used are summarised in table  [ obssum ] .",
    "the bulk of the observations were obtained on the 1 m anu telescope at siding spring observatory .",
    "a small number of observations were obtained on the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat , also at siding spring ) and on the 0.4 m telescope of the macquarie university observatory in sydney .",
    "one aim of the observations was to explore the effects of changes in @xmath0 , which may be regarded as the seeeing - normalised aperture .",
    "while natural variation in seeing provides changes in @xmath7 , we also varied @xmath6 by placing masks of different size over the telescope aperture .",
    "with the 1 m telescope we used mask sizes of 75 cm , 30 cm , 20 cm and 10 cm , with the smaller masks being placed off - centre to avoid the central obstruction of the secondary mirror . with the aat off - centre masks corresponding to apertures from 40 cm to 1.0 m were used located at the top of the `` chimney '' above the primary mirror central hole .",
    "a 2.5 m aperture was also achieved by closing down the primary mirror covers .    the frame exposure times used ranged from @xmath17 on the camera .",
    "additional runs with exposure times from @xmath18 were simulated by combining groups of consecutive frames from the @xmath19 runs .",
    "observations were made of a number of bright stars , as well as of some clusters and binaries of various angular separations to test the effects of selective imaging on image sharpness across the field . in each case observations",
    "were recorded with a range of different exposure times , and through different filters .",
    ".summary of _ music _ observing runs [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ colours ]     of stellar images binned in @xmath0 .",
    "open circles are the results of selecting and aligning the best 1% of frames . filled circles are the results of aligning all images with no frame selection (  shift - and - add \" processing ) .",
    "stars are the results of summing frames with no shifts ( i.e. giving the equivalent long exposure image).,height=325 ]    , but plotting the improvement in strehl ratio compared with the long exposure image for each bin of @xmath0 .",

    "open circles are the result of selecting and aligning the best 1% of frames .",
    "stars are the reult of summing all frames without alignment or selection giving the equivalent long exposure image .",
    "the line is the prediction from the simulation of @xcite .",
    "crosses are previous lucky imaging results as described in the text.,width=340 ]      to effectively freeze the turbulence the frame exposure time must be less than @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the bulk wind velocity in the region responsible for the turbulence .",
    "however a small @xmath14 limits the available targets to the brightest objects , and reduces the @xmath23 of each frame .",
    "thus it is crucial in frame selection to optimise @xmath14 .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ strehlt ] shows strehl ratios against exposure times for @xmath24 , with the data binned into four ranges of @xmath0 .",
    "the bottom panel plots the improvement in strehl ratio over the stacked images . even at the longest times tested ( @xmath25 ) the strehl ratios improved by a factor of 2 .",
    "shorter times gave greater improvement , but the curves appears to flatten below 8 to @xmath26 , especially for larger @xmath0 .",
    "hence we find that , although selective imaging gives improved image quality for any reasonably short exposure time , if the target is sufficiently bright @xmath14 should be limited to @xmath27 . for our typical @xmath7 of about 5 cm",
    "this corresponds to a wind speed of 5 @xmath28 .",
    "the ground wind speeds measured during the runs at siding spring were typically in the range 3 - 8 @xmath28 and therefore consistent with a significant amount of the seeing being generated near the ground . in better",
    "seeing or at longer wavelengths longer frame exposure times should be acceptable .    , width=355 ]",
    "our analysis confirms previous results in showing that substantial improvements in image strehl ratio can be achieved by selecting and aligning the sharpest frames in a time series of short exposure images . by reducing the telescope aperture to be a few multiples of @xmath7 , thereby minimising @xmath0 , and by selecting only 1% of the best quality frames strehl ratios as high as 0.6 to 0.8 were obtained .",
    "the improvement was greatest when imaging at longer wavelengths due to the larger values of @xmath7 .",
    "the optimum gain in strehl ratio over long exposures was found to be about a factor of 6 at @xmath29 . however , the strehl gain is rather insensitive to d/@xmath7 with improvements of a factor of 4 or more being obtained over the full range of d/@xmath7 from 3 to 12 .",
    "the improvements obtained by aligning frames without any selection ( shift - and - add processing ) are smaller , ranging from 2 to 3 .    frame selection has been found to improve image sharpness over a wide range of frame exposure times . even with exposure times as long as @xmath30 the strehl ratio was improved by a factor of 2 .",
    "however the best gains in strehl ratio ( from 4 to 6 ) for the siding spring site are obtained with @xmath31 .",
    "the optimum exposure time may be longer for sites with better seeing or at longer wavelengths .",
    "our results are consistent with previous lucky imaging studies , but explore a wider range of parameter space and show the potential for achieving larger strehl ratios than previous results , which have generally been limited to strehl ratios @xmath320.3 .",
    "the variation of strehl ratio with d/@xmath7 we observe shows a similar form to , but lies below the simulations of @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to telescope aberrations leading to a lower probability of achieving a lucky sharp image .",
    "we thank the staff of the siding spring observatory and the anglo - australian telescope for their suport of our observations .",
    "we also thank the director of the anglo - australian telescope , matthew colless , for provision of time on the aat , and the rsaa time allocation committee for assignments of time on the anu 1 m telescope .",
    "the helpful suggestions from alan vaughan and mark wardle of macquarie university are also appreciated .",
