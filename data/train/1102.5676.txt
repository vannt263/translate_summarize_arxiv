    "<S> we present an example revealing that the sign of the `` momentum '' @xmath0 of the wigner `` distribution '' function @xmath1 is not necessarily associated with the direction of motion in the real world . </S>",
    "<S> this aspect , which is not related to the well known limitation of the wigner function that traces back to the heisenberg s uncertainty principle , is particularly relevant in transport studies , wherein it is helpful to distinguish between electrons flowing from electrodes into devices and vice versa .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , we critically analyzed @xcite the manner in which the wigner `` distribution '' function was used in studies on molecular transport relying upon finite isolated clusters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these studies made us aware of a limitation of using the wigner function as a true momentum distribution function for transport , which we could not find in the literature and want to present here .    </S>",
    "<S> the wigner function @xmath1 is employed in many physical studies , including transport s , in spite of its physical limitations . </S>",
    "<S> the limitation known from textbooks @xcite traces back to the heisenberg s uncertainty principle </S>",
    "<S> . the wigner `` distribution '' function can be negative and should be not interpreted as a probability distribution , but rather as `` one step in the calculation  never the last step , since '' is not measurable but `` is used to calculate other quantities that can be measured  the particle density and current '' and `` </S>",
    "<S> no problems are encountered as long as one avoids interpreting @xmath2 as a probability density '' ( quotations from ch .  </S>",
    "<S> 3.7 , p.  203 of ref .  ) .    in transport , it is helpful to distinguish between incoming and outgoing electrons , i.  e. , flowing from electrodes into devices and from devices into electrodes @xcite . to this aim </S>",
    "<S> , it is necessary to use a physical property whose sign enables to indubitably assess that electrons are , say , left- or right - moving . </S>",
    "<S> the averages of the particle ( probability ) current operator @xmath3 , \\ ] ] or of the _ physical _ momentum @xmath4 do represent such properties . </S>",
    "<S> above , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are annihilation and creation field operators for ( spinless ) electrons moving in one dimension , and @xmath7 stands for electron s mass . to see whether the momentum `` variable '' @xmath0 of the wigner function @xmath8 justifies to speak of left- or right - moving electrons depending on the sign of @xmath0 , let us consider the ground state @xmath9 of @xmath10 noninteracting electrons confined within a one - dimensional square well of width @xmath11 and infinite height . </S>",
    "<S> electrons occupy energy levels @xmath12 , whose single - electron wave functions @xmath13 with @xmath14 , @xmath15 . in the ground state @xmath9 , the lowest @xmath10 levels are occupied up to the fermi `` momentum '' @xmath16 . </S>",

    "<S> ( color online ) wigner function for two sizes @xmath11 computed at two points @xmath18 indicated in the legend . </S>",
    "<S> gold s fermi wave vector @xmath19nm@xmath20 is used.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    one might think that one could use the wigner function as if it were a distribution function in cases where its shape resembles a fermi distribution . let us inspect the curves for @xmath1 computed as indicated above and presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wf ] . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , at smaller sizes ( close to the linear size of the au@xmath21-clusters used in molecular wigner transport studies @xcite ) the wigner function does not bear much resemblance to a fermi function ( the lower curves of fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : wf ] ) , at larger sizes ( much larger than those one could hope to tackle within ab initio calculations to correlated molecules , for which such a wigner - transport approach @xcite was conceived ) the curves ( the upper part of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wf ] ) become more similar to a step function , and one may think that this is encouraging . in reality , the contrary is true : as visible in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wf ] , _ mathematically _ one can calculate the wigner function for positive and negative `` momentum '' variables @xmath0 _ </S>",
    "<S> separately_. however , this mathematical separation does not reflect a physical reality : for any single - particle eigenstate @xmath22 the electron momentum vanishes @xmath23 left- and right - traveling waves are entangled with equal weight , and one can not speak of single - particle eigenstates representing left- or right - moving electrons only because wigner functions with positive or negative @xmath0-arguments can be computed .    </S>",
    "<S> this represents a further limitation of the usefulness of the wigner function , not related to the heisenberg s principle , which is particularly relevant for transport . </S>",
    "<S> the current has a direction , and if one wants to unambiguously specify this direction , the wigner function @xmath1 is inappropriate ; a wigner function with negative ( positive ) `` momentum '' , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , does not imply that left- and right - moving particles exist in the real physical world .    </S>",
    "<S> so , using @xmath26 and @xmath27 as if they were true momentum distributions of incoming electrons , as done in wigner approaches of molecular transport based on finite isolated clusters @xcite is not justified in quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the above example demonstrates that , indeed , the textbook s warning mentioned in the beginning of this section is pertinent . </S>"
