    "the study of nonclassical aspects of radiation from a variety of viewpoints is of considerable and continuing interest . on the conceptual side one can distinguish between phase sensitive signatures of nonclassicality and phase insensitive ones .",
    "the most familiar of the former is quadrature squeezing  @xcite , while in the latter we have amplitude squeezing or subpoissonian photon statistics  @xcite .",
    "higher order squeezing  @xcite as well as conditions on the factorial moments  @xcite of the photon number distribution ( pnd ) have also been presented as sufficient conditions for nonclassicality . in some cases ,",
    "the single mode treatments have been generalised to the two or general multimode situations  @xcite .    from another point of view ,",
    "a finer classification of states of quantised radiation according to increasing nonclassicality has been given , stressing the connection to the specific classes of observables being measured  @xcite .",
    "the case of gaussian - wigner distributions for a single mode field has been analysed in detail to give a concrete illustration of these ideas  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we give a complete treatment of phase insensitive measurements on the single mode quantized radiation field , and develop _ necessary and sufficient _",
    "conditions for nonclassicality of the field .",
    "our focus is on the pnd , for any given state , which contains all information concerning all phase insensitive measurements .",
    "there are several previous partial results in this direction .",
    "the best known is the mandel @xmath0-parameter criterion for distinguishing globally between sub and super poissonian statistics .",
    "this is _ global _ in the sense that the evaluation or measurement of the parameter @xmath0 in any given case requires knowledge of the probability for finding @xmath1 photons in the state , _ for all @xmath1_. we may also mention the important generalisation of the mandel @xmath0 parameter achieved by agarwal and tara  @xcite .",
    "our principal motivation is to look for _ local _ conditions on the pnd , involving only a _",
    "finite _ number of photon probabilities , which will serve as signatures to distinguish between classical and nonclassical states .",
    "this approach or viewpoint allows us to give a rather detailed analysis of oscillations  @xcite in the pnd , and to see precisely which kinds of oscillations stem from nonclassicality and which do not . as for the fact that we are able to obtain _ necessary and sufficient",
    "conditions for classicality , the principal tool we employ is the solution to the stieltjes moment problem  @xcite in the classical theory of moments - when can a given sequence of moments arise from a well - defined probability distribution ? the stieltjes problem deals with the case when the probability density is defined over the half line @xmath2 .",
    "in our context , this corresponds to the range of the intensity variable of light .",
    "the material of the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section  ii collects basic definitions related to the diagonal coherent state representation of a single mode field , and discusses the classical - nonclassical divide from several angles .",
    "the final one chosen is that suited to phase insensitive measurements .",
    "both the probabilities appearing in the pnd , and the factorial moments of the pnd , are recognised as moments of two auxiliary distributions over @xmath2 , one with a clear physical meaning and the other a formal one . in section",
    "iii we give the basic method for obtaining local classicality conditions on the pnd and obtain explicitly a minimal three term condition as an example .",
    "this condition involves the photon number probabilities @xmath3 for three successive values of @xmath1 , in contradistinction to the condition in terms of the mandel @xmath0 parameter which involves three successive ( the zeroth moment which equals unity in every state , and the first and second ) moments of @xmath3 .",
    "the keen reader will notice indications of an interesting duality already at this initial stage .",
    "we then put together a series of remarks and preliminary results based on these minimal conditions , which give a good orientation towards understanding the features of the pnd from both local and global points of view . in particular we are able to discriminate between oscillations in the pnd which genuinely reflect nonclassicality and others which do not .",
    "section  iv develops the complete necessary and sufficient conditions for classicality of the pnd , by mapping the present problem on to the stieltjes moment problem which is very well known and extensively studied .",
    "all the conditions obtained here are local in the sense mentioned above . from the necessary and sufficient conditions we then extract the conditions for classicality which go one step beyond the minimal ones discussed in section  ii",
    "; this helps us sharpen some of the conclusions reached earlier .",
    "section  v gives an alternative or dual approach based on the factorial moments of the pnd .",
    "this again is cast into the form of a stieltjes problem , and the necessary and sufficient conditions for classicality are similar to the previous ones in structure .",
    "section  vi compares and connects the two treatments , and section  vii contains concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a single mode quantized radiation field with photon creation and annihilation operators @xmath4 obeying the standard commutation relation @xmath5 \\equiv \\hat{a}\\hat{a}^{\\dag } -\\hat{a}^{\\dag}\\hat{a } = 1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a general ( pure or mixed ) state of the field is described by a hermitian nonnegative density operator @xmath6 with unit trace .",
    "according to the diagonal coherent state representation theorem , @xmath6 can be expanded as an integral over projections on to the coherent states : @xmath7 the integration being over the entire complex plane . here",
    "the coherent state @xmath8 is the normalized right eigenstate of @xmath9 with ( generally complex ) eigenvalue @xmath10 , related to the number operator eigenstates ( fock states ) @xmath11 in the standard manner : @xmath12 the weight function @xmath13 in eqn.(2.2 ) is real and normalised to unit integral : @xmath14 however it is in general not pointwise nonnegative  @xcite , and can be quite a singular quantity , namely a member of a certain precisely defined class of distributions over the plane .    any ( hermitian ) observable can always be written as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath9 in normal ordered form , @xmath16 say  @xcite .",
    "its expectation value in the state @xmath6 is then given by @xmath17 if in particular @xmath16 is phase invariant , then its expectation value does not require all the `` information '' contained in @xmath13 , and a simpler angle averaged auxiliary distribution @xmath18 suffices : @xmath19 we can regard @xmath20 as a real normalised marginal radial distribution function obtained from the complete @xmath13 . note that @xmath21 being phase invariant is the same as it being a function of the number operator @xmath22 .",
    "an important set of phase invariant @xmath23 s leads to the photon number distribution ( pnd ) or photon number probabilities @xmath24 in the state @xmath25 : @xmath26 ( the colons denote normal ordering ) .",
    "these @xmath3 are always well - defined for any bonafide @xmath6 and always obey the laws for a discrete probability distribution : @xmath27    with the two quantities @xmath13 and @xmath20 in hand , we can set up a three - fold classification of states @xmath6 of steadily increasing nonclassicality .",
    "conventionally @xmath6 is said to be classical if @xmath13 itself is a probability distribution , that is , pointwise nonnegative and nowhere more singular than a delta function ; otherwise it is nonclassical . in the former case",
    "it follows that @xmath20 also can be interpreted as a probability distribution for the intensity . in the latter case",
    ", a further refinement is possible based on the properties of @xmath20 and we arrive at the following scheme : @xmath28 this is an exhaustive and mutually exclusive classification . the special role or significance of the pnd @xmath24",
    "can now be expressed as follows : _ even if @xmath20 is not a well - defined probability distribution and we are in the strongly nonclassical regime , the quantity @xmath29 always has well - defined finite moments @xmath30 for all @xmath31_. for ease in the following we introduce a special symbol for these moments , @xmath32 the dependence on @xmath6 being left implicit . on the other hand , the pnd can not discriminate between the classical and the weakly nonclassical cases in eqn.(2.9 ) , in both of which @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , given a pnd @xmath24 leading to a pointwise nonnegative @xmath20 ( see below ) , if no phase sensitive quantities are to be measured we may take @xmath34 and check that via eqn.(2.2 ) we get a physically acceptable density operator @xmath25 .",
    "an interesting illustration of the weakly nonclassical case of eqn.(2.9 ) is the one - parameter family of states that results when a coherent state @xmath35 evolves through a kerr medium for a time interval @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , for suitable @xmath36 the state that results is the yurke - stoler state  @xcite @xmath37 this being the superposition of two coherent states has a @xmath13 more singular than a tempered distribution .",
    "nevertheless when angle averaged it leads to the same @xmath20 ( and hence the same pnd ) as for the single coherent state @xmath38 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the kerr medium being a function of @xmath39 leaves the diagonal matrix elements @xmath40 unaffected , but changes only the phases of @xmath41 for @xmath42 , and @xmath20 depends only on the diagonal elements of @xmath6 and not on the off - diagonal elements .    in the remainder of this work",
    "we shall be exclusively concerned with the pnd @xmath24 , or more generally with expectation values of phase insensitive observables alone . for these purposes",
    "we shall combinedly refer to the classical and weakly nonclassical cases of eqn.(2.9 ) as _ classical _ @xmath43 ; and to the strongly nonclassical in eqn.(2.9 ) as _ nonclassical _ @xmath44 .",
    "that is , for phase insensitive observables , we define : @xmath45 our principal aim now will be to develop _ necessary and sufficient _ conditions on the pnd @xmath24 for @xmath6 to be classical ; we may then say for brevity that we have a classical pnd .",
    "the recent experiment of munroe et al  @xcite best illustrates our considerations based on phase - insensitive measurements on the one hand and our classical - nonclassical divide  ( 2.13 ) based on @xmath20 on the other .",
    "they show that the phase averaged quadrature amplitude distribution @xmath46 measured by their optical homodyne detection apparatus is invertibly related to the pnd .",
    "we shall show presently that the relationship  ( 2.7 ) between @xmath20 and the pnd is invertible .",
    "it thus follows that their probability @xmath46 and our quasiprobability @xmath20 are invertibly related : their experiment extracts no more , and no less , information than contained in @xmath20 . in other words ,",
    "the classification  ( 2.13 ) , rather than  ( 2.9 ) , is the one relevant for such experiments .",
    "the distribution character of @xmath13 passes over to a corresponding property for @xmath20 - namely , it too is a member of a precisely defined class of distributions over @xmath2 . while it is clear that the sequence @xmath24 can not possibly capture all the information contained in @xmath13 as all the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath47 ,",
    "are ignored , we can easily show that the pnd @xmath24 and the distribution @xmath20 determine each other uniquely .",
    "to recover @xmath20 from @xmath24 we define a generating function @xmath48 , to represent the latter : @xmath49 there is a great deal of freedom in the way we set up @xmath50 ; we have chosen it so that , among other things , on the basis of eqn.(2.8 ) it is entire analytic in @xmath51 .",
    "one can then invert eqn.(2.14 ) by using the fourier - bessel integral theorem to get @xmath52    several signatures of nonclassicality of the pnd are well known .",
    "the most familiar is the mandel q - parameter criterion which distinguishes ( in a global sense ) between super and subpoissonian pnd s : @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55 however one can see that there are ( uncountably many ) states @xmath6 for which @xmath0 is undefined , on account of either @xmath56 or both @xmath57 and @xmath56 being divergent .",
    "this can happen because @xmath0 involves @xmath3 for all @xmath1 , and the rate of decrease of @xmath3 as @xmath58 may be insufficient for convergence of either @xmath57 or @xmath59 .",
    "a similar situation obtains with the factorial moments of the pnd , namely @xmath60 in terms of these , the mandel parameter is @xmath61 a well - known feature of the factorial moments is the following  @xcite : @xmath62    however , as with @xmath63 also involves @xmath3 for all but a finite number of values of @xmath1 , and is undefined for the vast majority of states @xmath25 .",
    "this discussion shows that in general , in contrast to @xmath64 , the moments @xmath65 of @xmath20 may not all exist .",
    "states @xmath6 for which all @xmath65 , or even all factorial moments upto some fixed maximum order , are finite are naturally quite severely restricted .",
    "one may enquire about the properties of the ordinary moments of the pnd , namely @xmath66 while they may seem to behave qualitatively like the @xmath65 , they are however not expressible as the moments of some function of @xmath67 simply related to @xmath20 ( as the @xmath3 and the @xmath65 are , eqns.(2.7,10,17 ) )",
    ". therefore we do not deal with them hereafter .",
    "the above discussion motivates the search for _ local _ consequences of classicality on the pnd , that is , inequalities involving only a finite number of the @xmath3 s which are always well defined and which must be obeyed if the pnd is classical . based on eqn.(2.7 )",
    ", the general form of such conditions can be surveyed as follows .",
    "consider a finite degree polynomial @xmath69 in a real nonnegative variable @xmath70 , with the property of itself being real nonnegative : @xmath71 the nontrivial case here is when some coefficients @xmath72 are negative ; for example @xmath69 could be the square of a polynomial with coefficients of both signs .",
    "then we find in view of  ( 2.10 ) : @xmath73 one thus finds that for a classical pnd , every polynomial obeying eqn.(3.1 ) leads to one inequality ( 3.2 ) ; so these are necessary local conditions for classicality .",
    "one can easily check that there are no such local conditions involving only two consecutive @xmath74 s .",
    "the simplest or minimal local conditions involve three consecutive @xmath74 s , and are obtained by choosing for @xmath69 an integral power of @xmath70 times a quadratic in the form of a perfect square : @xmath75 written in term of the true probabilities @xmath3 this reads : @xmath76 we shall call this _ sequence of local conditions the minimal or three - term classicality conditions _ on the pnd .",
    "we now list a series of direct consequences of the above discussions and of the minimal local conditions ( 3.3 ) for a pnd to be classical .    * for a classical pnd , the ( nonnegative ) distribution @xmath20 is either concentrated at @xmath77 , or else it has positive definite weight for some values or ranges of @xmath67 strictly greater than zero .",
    "the former corresponds to the vacuum state : @xmath78 in the latter situation we have @xmath79 both  ( 3.5 ) and  ( 3.6 ) are immediate consequences of  ( 2.7 ) or , equivalently ,  ( 2.10 ) .",
    "therefore we conclude : ( i ) if @xmath80 , the pnd is definitely nonclassical ; ( ii ) if the pnd is classical and the state is not the vacuum , every @xmath3 is strictly positive ; equally well a non - vacuum classical state can not be orthogonal to any fock state ; ( iii ) conversely , for a nonvacuum state , the vanishing of any one ( or more ) of the @xmath74 s implies nonclassicality .",
    "+ these conclusions can also be obtained recursively from the minimal conditions ( 3.3 ) : if @xmath81 for some @xmath82 , repeated use of these inequalities leads to @xmath83 for all @xmath84 , the state being assumed to be classical .",
    "+ hereafter we omit the vacuum state from consideration . * as a corollary to the above , we see that if @xmath6 is any state and @xmath85 is obtained by adding some number @xmath86 of photons to @xmath6 , @xmath87 then @xmath85 is always nonclassical . the normalisation constant @xmath88 needs to be finite for  ( 3.7 ) to make sense as a state .",
    "a direct calculation gives : @xmath89 where @xmath6 determines the pnd @xmath24 and @xmath85 determines @xmath90 . if the series for @xmath88 converges , then @xmath85 is a well defined state ; and then the vanishing of @xmath91 establishes its nonclassicality .",
    "this proves that _ all photon added states are nonclassical_. nonclassicality of photon added coherent states  @xcite and photon added thermal states  @xcite ( @xmath92 is finite in both cases ) have already been studied in great detail * for any classical pnd , since @xmath93 , we see that @xmath94 is a nonnegative function normalised to unit integral .",
    "therefore it can be treated mathematically as though it were a probability distribution over @xmath2 .",
    "however its physical interpretation is quite different from that of @xmath20 given earlier . *",
    "since @xmath95 is a geometric sequence for a poissonian distribution , we see that the minimal classicality conditions ( 3.3 ) are saturated in this case for every @xmath1 .",
    "thus we can interpret these conditions as requiring that the sequence @xmath24 be _ locally _ poissonian or superpoissonian _ at each @xmath1_. for a classical pnd each @xmath96 ( respectively @xmath3 ) has a lower bound determined by the values of the two previous @xmath97 s ( respectively @xmath98 s ) : @xmath99 if even at one value of @xmath84 we have @xmath100 so that the pnd is locally subpoissonian at that value of @xmath1 , the state is definitely nonclassical . * the inequalities ( 3.3 )",
    "also imply that for a classical pnd we can never have @xmath101 for any @xmath102 .",
    "that is , for classical states _ local maxima in the sequence @xmath95 are ruled out_. this implies in particular that no oscillations in @xmath95 are possible for such states .",
    "thus we arrive at the important conclusion : _ oscillation in _",
    "@xmath95 _ is a sure sign of nonclassicality_. * on the other hand , the minimal conditions ( 3.3 ) permit a local minimum in @xmath95 but no more than one .",
    "this is because if we have minima at @xmath103 and again at @xmath104 , there would necessarily be a local maximum in between , which is disallowed for classical states .",
    "* we can now combine ( e ) and ( f ) above to state the following . ever since the important work of schleich and wheeler on interference in phase space  @xcite , the statement that oscillation in @xmath24 is a signature of nonclassicality has almost become a folklore .",
    "indeed , oscillations in @xmath24 are known as nonclassical oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the striking virtue of this characterization is that it is _ local _ in @xmath1 , in the spirit of our present approach , as against other characterizations based on the ( factorial ) moments of @xmath24 .",
    "we have shown in fig.1 the sequence @xmath24 for a suitably chosen incoherent superposition of coherent states .",
    "this state is classical by construction , yet it exhibits oscillations in @xmath24 , showing that the above characterization needs quantification of some sort while retaining the attractive feature of being local in @xmath1 .",
    "our minimal local conditions ( 3.3 ) can be viewed as a quantification of this type .",
    "they limit the extent to which oscillations can occur in @xmath24 if the state is classical .",
    "these limits are obtained by translating properties ( e ) , ( f ) of @xmath95 above into corresponding properties of @xmath24 . for classical @xmath95 , ( e ) and ( f ) allow only four generic patterns of behaviour : ( i ) @xmath96 nondecreasing , provided a constant phase ( if any ) is _ followed _ , _ not preceded _",
    ", by an increasing phase ( if any ) ; ( ii ) @xmath96 non increasing , provided a constant phase ( if any ) is _ preceded , not followed _ , by a decreasing phase ( if any ) ; ( iii ) @xmath96 constant ( actually subsumed in the two previous possibilities ) ; ( iv ) @xmath96 passing through one local minimum , monotonic decreasing ( increasing ) before ( after ) the minimum . the monotonic increasing case is part of ( i ) , the monotonic decreasing case is part of ( ii ) .",
    "well known classical states constitute examples of these generic behaviours of classical @xmath95 , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "it turns out that constant phases in @xmath95 in cases ( i ) and ( ii ) above , allowed by the minimal local conditions ( 3.3 ) , but not shown in fig.2 , are indeed forbidden by the higher order local conditions as will be shown in section  iv .",
    "all these restrictions on classical @xmath95 translate into allowed behaviours for classical @xmath24 .",
    "first , local maxima , @xmath105 , are permitted , provided @xmath106 next , again because of the factor @xmath107 on the right hand side in the minimal classicality condition ( 3.4 ) , some amount of oscillation in @xmath24 is allowed .",
    "this is just the kind of oscillation seen in fig.1 .",
    "note that the period of oscillation ( difference of @xmath1 values at two successive maxima in @xmath24 ) in fig.1 is substantially greater than two as against the period two oscillations occurring in the pnd of a squeezed or cat state .",
    "for period two oscillations the conditions ( 3.4 ) place substantial restrictions on the amplitude .",
    "( indeed the next higher order local conditions to be derived in section  iv make these restrictions even more stringent ) .",
    "further , as the factor @xmath107 approaches unity as @xmath1 becomes large , the restrictions on the amplitude of a classically allowed period two oscillation are stronger at higher values of @xmath1 . to end the discussion in this paragraph we note that the _ period two classical oscillation _ in @xmath24 , allowed by our lowest order local condition ( 3.3,4 ) , indeed survives all higher order local conditions , as can be seen by the example shown in fig.3 .",
    "an instructive example illustrating many of the points made above is provided by the case of a pure state obtained as the superposition of two `` opposite '' coherent states : @xmath108 here @xmath109 is the relative phase ( in the pancharatnam sense  @xcite ) between the two components of the superposition . as special cases we get the yurke - stoler states ( 2.12 ) when @xmath110 , and the cat states when @xmath111 . for the pnd we have",
    "@xmath112 so that @xmath113 clearly , @xmath114 for even @xmath1 if @xmath115 ; and @xmath114 for odd @xmath1 if @xmath116 . thus the state @xmath117 violates the minimal local condition ( 3.3 ) and is nonclassical for all @xmath118 . for @xmath119",
    "these conditions are saturated at every @xmath1 , and we have a poissonian @xmath24 .    it is clear that nonclassicality of the yurke - stoler state ( 2.12 ) can be exhibited only through phase sensitive considerations , since the pnd is poissonian .",
    "it is also well known  @xcite that all pure states other than coherent states are nonclassical at least at the phase sensitive level .",
    "what is really interesting is the fact that for every @xmath120 , the nonclassicality of @xmath117 is coded in the phase insensitive pnd , and that our minimal conditions ( 3.3,4 ) capture this nonclassicality !",
    "we conclude this section with one more application of the local condition .",
    "recent years have witnessed a remarkable progress in quantum state reconstruction using techniques of optical homodyne tomography  @xcite . as a consequence it is now possible to `",
    "map out ' the wigner distribution of a state using the inverse radon transform , or reconstruct the density matrix in the fock basis using a set of pattern functions .",
    "schiller et al  @xcite report such a reconstructed density matrix @xmath121 for @xmath122 .",
    "the reported values of @xmath96 for @xmath123 to @xmath124 are @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the local conditions are clearly violated : @xmath132 .",
    "hence the state is nonclassical .",
    "the state was , of course , known to be quadrature squeezed , and hence nonclassical .",
    "what is interesting about the present illustration is the fact that the nonclassicality of the schiller et al state survives phase averaging , and that we are able to arrive at this definitive conclusion with just a few values of the diagonal elements of the density matrix !",
    "we have seen in the previous section that pointwise nonnegativity of @xmath20 , hence of @xmath133 , leads to the minimal local conditions ( 3.3,4 ) on the sequences @xmath134 . as already remarked , these are necessary conditions for classicality .",
    "central to this derivation was appreciation of the fact that the @xmath96 are _ moments _ of @xmath135 , eqn.(2.10 ) .",
    "we have also seen that if the state is classical , then @xmath136 is well - defined and mathematically interpretable as a probability distribution over @xmath2 . in this section",
    "we exhibit the _ necessary and sufficient _ conditions on the pnd @xmath95 in order that the state @xmath6 be classical .",
    "we then use these conditions to examine the extension of the inequalities ( 2 .. 23,24 ) to the five - term case .",
    "the reconstruction of a probability distribution from its moment sequence constitutes the classical moment problem on which there exists an enormous amount of literature  @xcite .",
    "when the probability distribution is over @xmath2 , one calls it the stieltjes moment problem .",
    "the hamburger moment problem corresponds to the case where the probability distribution is over @xmath137 ; and the hausdorff or the _ little _ moment problem corresponds to the finite interval @xmath138\\/$ ] .",
    "since the argument of @xmath135 is nonnegative , our problem of deriving necessary and sufficient conditions on the moment sequence @xmath95 in order that @xmath136 is a true probability distribution is then a stieltjes moment problem . in this section",
    "we can take advantage of the fact that these moments @xmath95 of @xmath135 are always well - defined and finite , whatever the state @xmath6 may be",
    ".    the solution of this classical problem is well known . to exhibit it ,",
    "construct from the sequence @xmath95 two symmetric matrices @xmath139 of dimension @xmath140 defined by @xmath141 that is , @xmath142 thus , @xmath143 arises from @xmath144 by deletion of the first column and the last row in the latter .",
    "notice also that the diagonal elements of @xmath145 are @xmath96 for even @xmath146 , while those of @xmath143 are @xmath96 for odd @xmath147 .",
    "now we quote the fundamental classical theorem  @xcite .    _ * theorem 1 : * _    the necessary and sufficient condition on the pnd sequence @xmath95 in order that the associated distribution @xmath136 be a true probability distribution over @xmath2 is that the above matrices be nonnegative for all @xmath148 : @xmath149    _ * proof : * _    we make use of the following two facts .",
    "\\(i ) a distribution @xmath135 over @xmath2 is pointwise nonnegative if and only if it leads to a nonnegative expectation value for every polynomial @xmath150 which is itself pointwise nonnegative over @xmath2  @xcite : @xmath151    \\(ii ) any polynomial @xmath150 pointwise nonnegative over @xmath2 can be written in terms of two perfect square polynomials as  @xcite @xmath152    to prove necessity , suppose that @xmath135 is pointwise nonnegative .",
    "consider the polynomial @xmath153 , where the @xmath72 are arbitrary real coefficients . by",
    "( 4.4 ) we have @xmath154 .",
    "that is , @xmath155 this means @xmath156 for every @xmath148 .",
    "similarly , writing @xmath157 and evaluating the expectation value of the nonnegative polynomial @xmath158 we have from ( 4.4 ) : @xmath159 this means @xmath160 for every @xmath148 .",
    "thus nonnegativity of @xmath135 implies that of every @xmath161 .    to prove sufficiency , assume @xmath162 for @xmath148 .",
    "given any nonnegative polynomial @xmath150 , writing it in the form ( 4.5 ) we find that @xmath163 .",
    "this implies , by fact ( i ) stated at the beginning of the proof , that @xmath164 .",
    "this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "now each matrix @xmath145 ( respectively @xmath143 ) arises from @xmath165 ( respectively @xmath166 ) by addition of one extra row and column , leaving the rest intact .",
    "therefore the result ( 4.3 ) translates into a series of determinant conditions : @xmath167    assume now that we have a classical pnd .",
    "then either @xmath168 for all @xmath169 , or @xmath170 for @xmath171 and @xmath172 for @xmath173 . in the latter case",
    "the support of @xmath135 ( the set of values of @xmath67 at which @xmath174 ) is a finite set of @xmath175 points  @xcite . in the former case it is an infinite set",

    "that is , @xmath145 and @xmath143 are ( essentially ) projection matrices .",
    "thus when the support of @xmath135 is a finite set of points , @xmath145 ( as also @xmath143 ) is the sum of @xmath175 projections .",
    "since @xmath180 contributes a projection only to @xmath145 but not to @xmath143 , one has the following refinement : if the support of @xmath135 consists of @xmath175 points including the point @xmath181 , then @xmath182 if and only if @xmath183 .",
    "it is useful to remark that the first fact ( 4.4 ) we have used in the proof of the theorem is common for all the three types of moment problems .",
    "what changes from one moment problem to another is the second fact dealing with the decomposition of nonnegative polynomials into sums of square polynomials , thus enabling us to convert ( 4.4 ) into simple matrix conditions .",
    "for instance , for the hamburger moment problem on @xmath137 we have , in place of ( 4.5 ) , the statement that every polynomial nonnegative over @xmath137 can be written as the sum of two square polynomials .",
    "thus in this case we have to deal only with the matrix @xmath145 , and the conditions @xmath156 for all @xmath148 are both necessary and sufficient for positivity of the underlying hamburger distribution .",
    "it is immediate to relate the minimal local conditions ( 3.3,4 ) to the above theorem .",
    "nonnegativity of @xmath139 demands as a necessary condition nonnegativity of every @xmath184 determinant obtained from @xmath184 blocks along the principal diagonals of @xmath145 and @xmath185 .",
    "this is precisely the condition ( 3.3 ) .",
    "it is also clear why these minimal conditions are only necessary : positivity of the diagonal @xmath184 blocks of @xmath161 does not capture in its entirety the positivity of @xmath145 and @xmath185 .",
    "we now go beyond the minimal conditions ( 3.3,4 ) and derive the next hierarchy of local conditions for a classical pnd .",
    "given @xmath95 we define @xmath186 this definition is legitimate since in any case for a classical pnd each @xmath187 .",
    "then the minimal conditions ( 3.3 ) simply read : @xmath188 as one may anticipate , the next order local conditions which we now derive , and which are still only necessary conditions for classicality , involve five consecutive @xmath189 s , or equivalently three consecutive @xmath190 s .",
    "a necessary condition for the nonnegativity of @xmath139 is that their diagonal @xmath191 blocks be nonnegative .",
    "that is , @xmath192 if we bring in @xmath193 here and eliminate @xmath194 in favour of the other variables , this reads : @xmath195 this entails three conditions : @xmath196 .",
    "the first two are already obeyed ; and after elementary algebra the third reduces to a condition expressible in terms of three consecutive @xmath190 s : @xmath197 these are our next to minimal or _",
    "second order local conditions _ on the pnd for classicality .    to conclude this section , we present an interesting implication of these conditions . as already noted , if @xmath24 is poissonian then @xmath95 is a geometric sequence , so @xmath198 identically and ( 3.3 ) are saturated .",
    "we now ask whether it is possible to have a classical state for which @xmath199 for some values of @xmath200 , whereas @xmath201 for other @xmath31 s . such classical states ,",
    "if they exist , can be said to be _ locally poissonian _ at the former values of @xmath1 , namely whenever @xmath202 .",
    "suppose a classical state is locally poissonian at @xmath203 , with @xmath204 .",
    "then two applications of ( 4.13 ) , once with @xmath205 and then with @xmath206 , lead to @xmath207 . continuing this process",
    "we end up with @xmath198 for all @xmath200 .",
    "thus a classical state can not be only locally poissonian : it is either locally poissonian throughout , @xmath208 for all @xmath84 ) or locally superpoissonian throughout ( @xmath209 for all @xmath31 ) .",
    "translating this to @xmath24 we can now strengthen our minimal conditions ( 3.4 ) to say :    for a classical pnd , either @xmath210 this is a refinement of the minimal or first order necessary local classicality conditions ( 3.4 ) in the light of the second order conditions ( 4.13 ) .",
    "it is now clear that the constant phases allowed in patterns ( i ) and ( ii ) under ( g ) preceding eqn.(2.31 ) are forbidden by the above refined condition ( 4.14 ) .",
    "this renders fig.2 generic and exhaustive .",
    "in this section we present an approach to classicality of a pnd based on the normal ordered moments of @xmath6 or factorial moments of @xmath24 , namely the sequence @xmath211 defined in eqn.(2.17 )",
    ". this approach will be along the lines of earlier work of agarwal and tara  @xcite ; however our conditions for classicality will be both _ necessary and sufficient_. as is amply clear from the discussion in section  ii , though , we must bear in mind that for the vast majority of states @xmath6 and pnd s @xmath24 , the @xmath65 are not all defined .",
    "suppose we have a pnd @xmath24 whose factorial moments @xmath211 are all finite and known .",
    "( this certainly places very severe restrictions on the behaviour of @xmath3 for large @xmath31 ) .",
    "our problem is to find necessary and sufficient conditions on @xmath211 in order that the pnd be classical .",
    "now the @xmath65 are the moments of @xmath20 , just as in the preceding section the @xmath96 were moments of @xmath212 . at the risk of repetition , the finiteness of all @xmath65 places very strong restrictions on @xmath213 .",
    "it is now clear that we have again a stieltjes moment problem .",
    "we want the necessary and sufficient conditions on @xmath211 to ensure pointwise nonnegativity of @xmath213 .",
    "form two matrices @xmath214 of dimension @xmath140 using the @xmath215 s : @xmath216 both are real symmetric ; @xmath217 equals @xmath218 with first column and last row deleted ; and @xmath219 has @xmath65 for @xmath86 even ( odd ) along the diagonal .",
    "thus , exactly as in section  iv , we have :    the necessary and sufficient conditions for the pnd @xmath24 to be classical ( given the existence of all factorial moments @xmath65 ) are @xmath220 the proof is exactly parallel to that in section  iv , with @xmath221 replaced respectively by @xmath222 .",
    "this theorem completes the work initiated by agarwal and tara  @xcite , by improving their necessary conditions for classicality ( they had only the condition @xmath223 ) into the necessary and sufficient condition  ( 5.2 ) .",
    "thus the constraints on the factorial moments arising from the requirements @xmath223 are the same as in their work : with @xmath224 we have @xmath225 , ie . ,",
    "@xmath226 which ( see eqn.(2.18 ) ) is the same as requiring the mandel q - parameter to be nonnegative .",
    "with @xmath227 we obtain the additional condition @xmath228 , and so on as in  @xcite .",
    "however the constraints arising from @xmath229 are new .",
    "for @xmath230 we have @xmath231 ; for @xmath224 we have @xmath232 ; and so on .    to conclude this section , let us re - examine the class of pure states @xmath233 defined in eqn.(2.32 ) within the present approach .",
    "all the @xmath65 do exist in this case and are easily calculated .",
    "@xmath234 this leads to the following matrices @xmath235 and @xmath217 : @xmath236 it is clear that both @xmath235 and @xmath217 are matrices of rank 2 .",
    "it is further clear from their structures that @xmath223 if and only if @xmath237 , while @xmath238 if and only if @xmath239 .",
    "we thus get again the same results as in section  ii : for @xmath120 , the state @xmath240 has a nonclassical pnd .    we wish to remark once again that the fact that the conditions @xmath238 in ( 5.2 ) are needed over and above @xmath223 to form a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for classicality is ultimately due to the fact that our moment problem is a stieltjes problem : had it been a hamburger problem , the agarwal - tara conditions @xmath223 would have been both necessary and sufficient !",
    "we have presented two approaches to the problem of phase - insensitive nonclassicality of a quantum state @xmath6 : one based on @xmath95 , the moment sequence of @xmath241 ; the other dual approach based on @xmath211 , the moment sequence of @xmath20 when defined . in each case",
    "we obtained necessary and sufficient conditions for a pnd to be classical , exploiting the fact that the underlying problem was a stieltjes moment problem . in this section",
    "we bring out explicitly the connection between these dual approaches and establish their equivalence , in the case ( naturally ) when all @xmath65 are defined .    the fact that @xmath242 suggests the use of laplace transforms  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath243 be the laplace transforms of @xmath244 respectively : @xmath245 we now exploit the fact that the moments of a distribution are simply related to the derivatives of its laplace transform at the origin : @xmath246 making two taylor series expansions of @xmath247 , once about @xmath248 and then about @xmath249 , equating the two expansions and using eqn.(6.2 ) , we have : @xmath250 equating derivatives of both sides first at @xmath248 and then at @xmath249 gives the pair of relations @xmath251 writing the two sequences @xmath252 as two column vectors @xmath0 and @xmath253 respectively we have the infinite matrix equations @xmath254 we have displayed @xmath255 to exhibit the fact that these matrices are unchanged if the first row and first column are deleted .",
    "we shall have occasion to return to this important feature .",
    "while @xmath0 and @xmath253 considered as ( infinite dimensional ) column vectors are connected by the matrix @xmath256 , the corresponding infinite dimensional matrices @xmath257 and @xmath258 are connected through a symmetric transformation using @xmath259 .",
    "we have : @xmath260 ( so both matrices are upper triangular : these matrix elements vanish for @xmath261 ) . that @xmath259 and @xmath262 so defined are indeed inverses of one another follows simply from the familiar properties of binomial coefficients .",
    "using these same properties it may be verified that @xmath263 this proves that @xmath264 if and only if @xmath265 .",
    "let @xmath266 be the moment sequence derived from @xmath0 by simply dropping @xmath267 .",
    "clearly , @xmath268 is in the same relation to @xmath266 as @xmath269 is to @xmath0 .",
    "similarly if we form @xmath270 from @xmath253 by simply dropping @xmath271 , then @xmath272 is in the same relation to @xmath270 as @xmath273 is to @xmath253 .",
    "now recalling the fact that @xmath274 have the interesting property of each being unchanged upon deletion of the first row and first column we conclude : @xmath275 this proves that @xmath276 if and only if @xmath277 . combined with the statement after eqn.(6.7 ) , we have thus established the equivalence of the two approaches .",
    "they are dual to one another , and in particular theorem 1 is equivalent to theorem 2 .",
    "the above analysis shows that if we drop the first @xmath175 terms from the moment sequence of a bonafide stieltjes probability distribution ( in the semi - infinite interval ) , the result is again a bonafide stieltjes moment sequence ( of some other valid probability distribution ) .",
    "this is a distinguishing feature of the stieltjes moment problem .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the corresponding statement is true for the hamburger moment problem ( on the entire real line ) only if an _ even _ number of initial terms are dropped from the moment sequence .",
    "every probability distribution @xmath24 over the nonnegative integers , admissible according to the laws of classical probability theory , can appear as the pnd of some quantum state @xmath6 of the single mode radiation field .",
    "we have given explicit necessary and sufficient conditions - in two equivalent or dual forms - for a pnd to be the result of a classical state in the sense appropriate to quantum optics . from the perspective of classical probability theory , the significant points are these : that we are able to view the quantities @xmath278 as the moments , in the stieltjes sense , of an auxiliary function @xmath135 , and that the properties of @xmath135 or equally well of @xmath20 determine whether the state is classical or not .",
    "the route from @xmath24 to @xmath20 is via the pair of eqns.(2.14,15 ) .",
    "we have emphasized the following points in our work : ( i ) that local classicality conditions on the pnd are naturally available for all states @xmath6 ; and ( ii ) all statements based on the factorial moments make sense only for a quite limited set of states @xmath6 , for which the probabilities @xmath3 go to zero `` sufficiently fast '' as @xmath279 .",
    "it seems to us that some of these points have not been given in the past as much attention as they deserve . above this",
    ", we stress the completeness of our results , and the more careful treatment of oscillations in the pnd as a signature of nonclassicality , which becomes possible with our local approach .",
