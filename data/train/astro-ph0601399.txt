    "according to the prebiotic soup hypothesis @xcite , the early earth had the supply of organic compounds needed to jump - start polymerization reactions that , through gradual complexification , led to the first biochemical networks displaying some of the characteristics attributed to life , such as metabolic activity and replication .",
    "although the road is still obscure @xcite , the situation is not all bleak . in 1953",
    ", stanley miller simulated tentative conditions of early - earth in the laboratory to obtain amino acids from simple chemical compounds .",
    "that same year , frank @xcite proposed that auto - catalytic polymerization could explain the emergence of biomolecular homochirality , a clear signature of terrestrial and , possibly , all life @xcite : terrestrial amino acids belonging to proteins are overwhelmingly left - handed , while sugars are right - handed .",
    "if a bottom - up approach to the early development of life is adopted , the homochirality of life s biochemistry must have emerged dynamically , as reactions among the simplest molecular building blocks occurred with high enough yield .",
    "alternatively , one may assume that , somehow , only monomers of a single chirality were present in the prebiotic soup : they were made that way or brought here during the intense bombardment of earth s infancy , that lasted to about 3.8 gyr ago @xcite .",
    "we would , however , still need to understand how homochirality developed elsewhere in the cosmos and not here , and whether it developed with the same chiral bias in more than one place .    here",
    ", we consider the homochirality of life as an emergent process that took place on early - earth and , possibly , other planetary platforms . as a starting point ,",
    "we use the reaction - network model proposed by sandars @xcite , which includes enantiometric cross - inhibition .",
    "as shown in the interesting work of brandenburg and multamki @xcite ( bm ) , sandar s polymerization reaction network can be reduced to an effective spatio - temporal mean - field model , where the order parameter is the chiral asymmetry between left and right - handed polymers . to this , we add the effects of an external environment , showing that they can be crucial in the final determination of the net value of enantiometric excess , if any .",
    "sandars proposed the following polymerization reactions @xcite : @xmath0 ; @xmath1 ; @xmath2 ; and , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are the reaction rates for adding monomers of the same ( opposite ) chirality to a given chain . the network is completed by adding the four opposite reactions , that is , by interchanging @xmath6 , and by adding a substrate @xmath7 from which both left and right - handed monomers emerge , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 determine the enzymatic enhancement of left and right - handed monomers , which is not known .",
    "we follow sandars and choose @xmath11 $ ] , @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "as remarked in bm , it is possible to truncate the system to @xmath13 and still maintain the essential aspects of the dynamics leading to homochiralization .",
    "this allows us to model the reaction network as a mean - field theory exhibiting spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "our approach blends the work of bm with the pioneering work of kondepudi and nelson , where the reaction network was coupled to time - dependent external effects @xcite : chirality evolves spatio - temporally in contact with an environment .",
    "the equations can be simplified by assuming that the rate of change of @xmath14 $ ] and @xmath15 $ ] is much slower than that of @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] .",

    "the constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 are given in terms of the fidelity of enzymatic reactions @xmath26 , an adjustable parameter .",
    "as demonstrated by kondepudi and nelson @xcite and many others @xcite , auto - catalytic networks show a tendency to bifurcate toward homochirality for values above critical , @xmath27 .",
    "the specific value of @xmath27 is model - dependent .    under the above assumptions , and introducing the dimensionless symmetric and asymmetric variables , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30(2k_s / q)^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath31(2k_s / q)^{1/2}$ ]",
    ", bm have shown that the polymerization equations reduce to @xmath32 where @xmath33 , with dimension of inverse time .",
    "@xmath34 is a fixed point : the system will tend towards this value at time - scales of order @xmath35 . with @xmath34 ,",
    "the equation for the chiral asymmetry has fixed points at @xmath36 , as pointed out in bm .",
    "an enantiometric excess is only possible if @xmath37 .",
    "we model the external environment via a stochastic spatio - temporal langevin equation , rewriting the equations above as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the diffusion constant and @xmath40 represent white noise with zero mean and a two - point correlation function given by @xmath41 , and @xmath42 measures the strength of the external influence .",
    "for example , in mean - field models of phase transitions , it is common to write @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath45 is the temperature , and @xmath46 is a viscosity coefficient .",
    "the equations can be made dimensionless by introducing @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which determine the typical spatio - temporal scales in the system .",

    "[ see also @xcite ] , the concentrations are spatially - dependent quantities .",
    "this implicitly assumes that it is possible to define an effective correlation volume within which the value of the chiral asymmetry @xmath62 is fairly homogeneous .",
    "( we take @xmath34 . )",
    "using well - known results from the mean - field theory of phase transitions @xcite , we can easily compute the correlation length . from the equation for @xmath62",

    "for the fixed points , we get , @xmath69 . at @xmath70",
    "the correlation length diverges , as it should for a critical point",
    ". however , the noise parameter @xmath71 also controls the behavior of the system .",
    "indeed , even if @xmath72 , an enantiometric excess may not develop if @xmath71 is above a critical value @xmath73 . in analogy with ferromagnets , where above a critical temperature the net magnetization is zero",
    ", one may say that above @xmath73 the stochastic forcing due to the external environment overwhelms any local excess of @xmath74 over @xmath75 enantiometers within a domain of correlation volume @xmath76 : racemization is achieved at large scales and chiral symmetry is restored throughout space .",
    "salam @xcite suggested that there should be a critical temperature @xmath77 above which any net homochirality is destroyed .",
    "however , he conceded that calculating @xmath77 would be quite challenging using the electroweak theory of particle physics . here , we chose a different route which , we believe , will allow us to explore the qualitative aspects of the problem more effectively : the noise amplitude @xmath71 may represent a sudden increase in temperature and/or pressure due to a meteoritic impact or volcanic eruption , or , possibly , due to a source of circularly - polarized ultraviolet light @xcite .",
    "the equation dictating the evolution of the enantiometric excess @xmath62 , eq .",
    "[ aeq ] , was solved with a finite - difference method in a @xmath78 grid and a @xmath79 grid with @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and periodic boundary conditions . in 2d , this corresponds to simulating a shallow pool with linear dimensions of @xmath82 cm .",
    "we prepared the system initially in a chirally pure phase , which we chose to be @xmath83 .",
    "the equation is then solved for different values of the external noise , @xmath71 . as can be seen in figure [ tcritfig ] , for @xmath84 , @xmath85 ,",
    "that is , the system becomes racemized .",
    "@xmath86 approaches a constant for large times , indicating that the reaction network reaches equilibrium with the environment .",
    "the results are ensemble averaged . for @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "we can describe the environmental impact on homochirality at the microscopic level by introducing the `` ginzburg criterion '' familiar of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "consider a correlation volume with @xmath89 ( or @xmath90 ) .",
    "what is the energy barrier ( @xmath91 ) to flip half the molecules in the volume so that @xmath85 ? if @xmath92 is the number of molecules in a correlation volume , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the energy to flip one molecule .",

    ", they would induce a tilt in the potential @xmath63 proportional to @xmath108 .",
    "thus , within the violent environment of prebiotic earth , effects from such sources , even if cumulative , would be negligible : any accumulated excess could be easily wiped out by an external disturbance .",
