    "the lanthanum monochalcogenides belong to the wide class of binary rare - earth monochalcogenides with the nacl - type structure , which has been intensively studied because of their interesting physical properties including complex magnetic structures , pressure induced insulator - metal transitions , anomalous valence fluctuations , and unusual fermi surface properties.@xcite the trivalent lanthanum monochalcogenides are superconductors near 1 k , and the superconducting transition temperature as well as the electronic specific heat coefficient increases from the monosulfide to the monotelluride , whereas the debye temperature decreases from las to late@xcite .    in this work",
    "we explore the high pressure behavior of the la chalcogenides by experiment and theory .",
    "high - pressure x - ray diffraction experiments are conducted on las and lase to obtain equations of states including discontinuous structural transitions from the nacl structure ( space group fm3 m , z=1 , also called the b1 structure in the following ) to the cscl structure ( space group pm3 m , z=4 , also termed the b2 structure in the following ) .",
    "density functional calculations are performed to compare basic theoretical predictions with the measurements .",
    "the present experimental study of las extends our previous study on u@xmath0la@xmath1s compounds@xcite . for lase no high - pressure results",
    "have been reported previously , while high - pressure experiments on late report a structural transition from b1 to b2 at around 7 gpa@xcite .",
    "a second objective of the present work is to investigate the elastic properties of the lanthanum chalcogenides , for which there are no experimental results available .",
    "elastic constants are derived from total energy variations with applied strains .",
    "we compare our results with recent theoretical work@xcite and find good agreement .",
    "the systematics of the electronic band structure through the lanthanum and cerium chalcogenide series was studied with angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "the fermi surface properties of lanthanum monochalcogenides have been studied by de haas - van alphen effect measurements@xcite . from the theoretical side the energy band structure , superconductivity , surface electronic structure , optical and magneto - optical spectra as well as structural stability of lanthanum monochalcogenides",
    "have been investigated by several authors using the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) as well as the lsda+u approximation@xcite .",
    "a few papers also focused on the calculation of second and third order elastic constants using the short range repulsive potential method @xcite . a few experimental studies such as point contact spectroscopy@xcite , reflectivity@xcite and phonon spectra@xcite have been reported for las .",
    "the magneto - optical properties of lanthanum chalcogenides have been investigated experimentally,@xcite where a non - zero kerr effect could be observed in these pauli paramagnets by applying an external magnetic field .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the computational and experimental details of our work .",
    "the calculated ground state properties , elastic constants as well as the experimental and theoretical results for the high - pressure behavior and structural transitions are presented in section 3 , and the conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "in this work we have used the all - electron full - potential linear muffin tin orbital ( fp - lmto ) method@xcite to calculate the total energies and the basic ground state properties . here",
    "the crystal is divided into two regions : non - overlapping muffin - tin spheres surrounding each atom and the interstitial region between the spheres .",
    "we used a double @xmath2 spdf lmto basis ( each radial function within the spheres is matched to a hankel function in the interstitial region ) for describing the valence bands .",
    "the following basis set was used in the calculations : la(5s,6s,5p,5d,4f ) , s(3s,3p,3d ) , se(4s,4p,3d,4d ) , te(5s,5p,4d,5d ) .",
    "the exchange correlation potential was calculated within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) scheme@xcite .",
    "the charge density and potential inside the muffin - tin spheres were expanded in terms of spherical harmonics up to @xmath3=6 , while in the interstitial region , they were expanded in plane waves , with 6566 ( energy up to 109.80 ry ) waves being included in the calculation .",
    "total energies were calculated as a function of volume , for a ( 18 18 18 ) k - mesh , corresponding to 195 k - vectors in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone , and the results fitted to the birch equation of state@xcite to obtain the ground state properties .",
    "the elastic constants were obtained from the variation of the total energy under volume - conserving strains , as outlined in ref . .",
    "experiments were carried out at the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) , on the id30 beamline dedicated to high pressure diffraction experiments , in the angular dispersive mode , using a double focused monochromatic beam at @xmath4=0.3738  .",
    "loading of las and lase powders were performed in le toullec - type diamond anvil cells ( dac ) , using nitrogen , argon or silicone oil as the pressure transmitting media .",
    "the pressure inside the cell was determined via the ruby fluorescence method @xcite from a small ruby ball mounted alongside the lax sample . the sample",
    "to detector distance was calibrated before each set of experiments by means of a standard silicon powder sample .",
    "diffraction images were captured with a fastscan @xcite image plate detector , and processed using the esrf fit2d program@xcite to provide data in a format suitable for rietveld analysis using the fullprof program@xcite .",
    "the lattice constants at ambient pressure have been determined as a@xmath5=5.852 and a@xmath5=6.067   for las and lase , respectively , in good agreement with previous experimental data given by ref . .",
    "the calculated ground state properties such as equilibrium lattice constant , bulk modulus and its pressure derivative are given in table 1 .",
    "the calculated equilibrium lattice constants are generally overestimated by @xmath6 % compared to experiment , which is an improvement compared to earlier calculations@xcite .",
    "similarly , for the bulk modulus , the agreement between theory and experiment has improved@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the bulk moduli of the lanthanum chalcogenides are quite similar to those of the neighboring cerium chalcogenides , which are characterized by a localized @xmath7 state@xcite : @xmath8 gpa , @xmath9 gpa and @xmath10 gpa , for ces , cese and cete , respectively .",
    "similarly , the calculated bulk moduli of the praseodymium chalcogenides are @xmath11 gpa , @xmath12 gpa and @xmath13 gpa , for prs , prse and prte , respectively , when pr is represented in a trivalent configuration @xcite",
    ". these similarities of numbers corroborate the practice of taking the lanthanum chalcogenides as non - magnetic reference systems for the later rare - earth chalcogenides .",
    "the calculated elastic constants of las , lase and late are listed in table 2 , where we also compare to the recent lapw calculation of ref . .",
    "the two theoretical approaches find very similar @xmath14 value for las and lase , while for late this parameter is @xmath15 smaller in the present calculations than found by the lapw method .",
    "the present @xmath16 and @xmath17 parameters are in all cases lower than found in ref .",
    ", for lase @xmath16 with almost a factor of 2 difference .",
    "our calculated shear moduli @xmath18 are 19% to 40% larger than the ones calculated with lapw . for young s modulus @xmath19 ,",
    "our values are 16% to 35% higher , and finally , for poisson s ratio @xmath20 our values are 8% to 17% lower than the lapw results .",
    "the largest discrepancies between the two calculations occur for late in all cases .",
    "furthermore , we observe the general trend that the heavier the chalcogenide is , the softer is the compound . this trend is expected and easy to understand , since with increased chalcogen size , the lattice parameter increases and the valence orbitals become increasingly delocalized due to a higher number of nodes.@xcite    as previously stated , there is at present no experimental information regarding the elastic constants available for the lanthanum chalcogenides .",
    "the elastic constants of las are of roughly the same magnitude as those measured for the isoelectronic ys compound ( table 2 ) .",
    "table 3 presents sound velocities and debye temperatures , as derived from the calculated elastic constants@xcite .",
    "the debye temperatures have been determined experimentally from the low - temperature specific heat , and the agreement with our calculations is excellent ( the calculated debye temperatures are 0.5% to 6% higher than experiment ) , which can be taken as an indirect check on our calculated elastic constant values .",
    "the high pressure structural behavior of the lanthanum chalcogenides was studied both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the calculated total energies as functions of relative volume for las , lase and late are shown in figure [ fig:1 ] , while experimental and theoretical pressure - volume relations are presented in figures 2 , 4 and 5 for las , lase and late , respectively .",
    "figure 3 shows the diffraction spectra recorded for las and lase .",
    "it appears from the theory presented in figure 1 that with compression the b2 phase becomes more and more favorable , and eventually a transition from the b1 structure to the b2 structure occurs . from the common tangent of the b1 and b2 total energies",
    "the transition pressure is determined .",
    "the calculated transition pressure for las is 29.3 gpa with a volume collapse of 10.3% , which is in good agreement with the experimental transition pressure of 27 - 28 gpa with a volume collapse of around 9.5% as shown in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "a similar transition was predicted to occur in ces around 24.3 gpa , in which the ce ions are in a tetravalent state@xcite in the case of prs a similar transition is predicted to occur around 22 gpa , in this case with the pr ions remaining trivalent@xcite .",
    "the transition pressure of las is similar to that of the pnictogen group neighbour lap , in which a transition from the b1 structure to a distorted b2 structure is observed experimentally around 24 gpa@xcite .    like las",
    ", lase also undergoes a b1 @xmath21 b2 transition , experimentally seen at a pressure of 19 gpa with a volume reduction of 10% , cf .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] , for which the present theory finds concordant values of @xmath22 gpa with a volume collapse of @xmath23 . in the case of cese",
    "a similar transition from b1 type to b2 type occurs around 20 gpa@xcite , in this case with the ce ion remaining trivalent on both sides of the transition according to theory@xcite . even for prse a b1 @xmath21 b2 transition is predicted to occur around 12 gpa , wherein the pr ions remain trivalent@xcite .",
    "the transition pressure of lase is similar to that of the pnictogen neighbour laas , in which a transition from b1 structure to a distorted b2 type occurs around 20 gpa@xcite . as far as late is concerned a transition from b1 type to b2 type is reported around 7 gpa@xcite , which agrees quite well with the calculated transition pressure of 9.7 gpa with a volume reduction of 10.4% , cf .",
    "both cete and prte undergo a transition from b1 type to b2 around 8@xmath241 gpa@xcite and 9@xmath241 gpa@xcite . when comparing the pnictogen neighbour lasb with that of late the pnitogen undergoes a transition from b1 type to a distorted b2 type structure around 11 gpa@xcite which is slightly higher than that of late .",
    "by means of a combined theoretical and experimental study the high - pressure structural behavior of lax ( x = s , se , te ) compounds have been investigated .",
    "unlike the lanthanum monopnictides which show a transition from b1 to a distorted b2 structure@xcite , the lanthanum monochalcogenides exhibit a simple b1 @xmath21 b2 structural phase transition , similar to the one found for most of the lanthanide and actinide monochalcogenides studied up to now@xcite .    for all three systems studied here ,",
    "the volume collapse is around 10% ( from both experiment and theory ) at the b1 @xmath21 b2 transition .",
    "let us compare this magnitude of the volume collapse to a very simple model in which we assume that at the transition point , the la ",
    "x bond length is restored to the ambient value .",
    "we expect such a model to underestimate the volume collapse , since the bond length at high pressure most probably will be a bit smaller than at ambient pressure .",
    "our simple model gives the following relation between the relative volume @xmath25 just before the transition and the volume collapse @xmath26 : @xmath27 for las , the experimental relative volume at the transition is 0.82 , which would give a volume collapse of 6% according to this model .",
    "for lase , the corresponding numbers are 0.84 and 8% .",
    "thus , the volume collapse observed experimentally ( and from density functional calculations ) can be viewed as a partial restoration of the original bond length between the la and the chalcogenide .",
    "based on the above discussion we conclude that the volume collapse observed in the lanthanum chalcogenides is entirely consistent with a simple picture of the transition in which the volume collapse is a consequence of the rearrangement of the atoms to a more close - packed structure while the total number of valence electrons remains unchanged .",
    "we have also checked the partial occupation number of spdf states across the structural transition and there is no appreciable change in the occupation numbers across the transition .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation in many ce systems , in which the volume collapse is accompanied by delocalization of an @xmath7 electron.@xcite    g. v , v. k , a. d , and b. j acknowledge v. r. and ssf for the financial support and snic for the computer time .",
