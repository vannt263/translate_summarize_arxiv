    "one of the fundamental goals of observational cosmology is to determine the expansion rate of the universe as a function of redshift .",
    "measurements of the expansion history , which can be described by the evolution of the hubble parameter @xmath10 with redshift @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the cosmic scale factor at time @xmath13 , provide one of the most important observational tests of the cosmological models which characterize the different components of the universe and their evolution with time .",
    "in particular , a paramount problem in cosmology is to understand the physical significance of the `` dark energy '' which appears to dominate the cosmic energy density today , as described by the phenomenology of the standard cosmological - constant cold - dark - matter ( @xmath14cdm ) model .",
    "a number of powerful tools to measure the cosmic expansion history beyond the local universe have been developed in recent decades .",
    "foremost amongst these probes is the use of distant type ia supernovae ( sne ) as standard candles ( e.g.  riess et al .",
    "1998 , perlmutter et al .  1999 ,",
    "amanullah et al .",
    "2010 , conley et al .",
    "2011 , suzuki et al .",
    "the apparent peak magnitude of these supernovae , following certain corrections based on the light - curve shape which decrease the observed scatter in the peak brightness , yield a relative luminosity distance as a function of redshift , i.e. @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the luminosity distance , @xmath17 is the local hubble parameter and @xmath18 is the speed of light .",
    "although such measurements accurately trace the shape of the distance - redshift `` hubble diagram '' in the redshift range @xmath19 , a number of qualifications must be mentioned .",
    "firstly , the expansion history @xmath6 is not directly measured by supernovae but must be determined as a derivative of the noisy luminosity distances ( wang & tegmark 2005 , sollerman et al .",
    "2009 , shafieloo & clarkson 2010 ) .",
    "secondly , obtaining the expansion rate from the luminosity distance requires an additional assumption about spatial curvature , which influences the geodesics followed by photons .",
    "thirdly , despite the impressive and thorough treatment in recent supernovae analyses of the systematic errors which could bias cosmological fits , these systematics now limit the utility of these datasets .",
    "large galaxy surveys offer a complementary route for mapping cosmic distances and expansion , using two principal techniques .",
    "firstly , the large - scale clustering pattern of galaxies contains the signature of baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) , a preferred length scale imprinted in the distribution of photons and baryons by the propagation of sound waves in the relativistic plasma of the early universe .",
    "this length scale , the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch @xmath20 , may be accurately calibrated by observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and applied as a cosmological standard ruler ( blake & glazebrook 2003 , seo & eisenstein 2003 ) .",
    "some applications to galaxy datasets are presented by eisenstein et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , percival et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , beutler et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , blake et al .",
    "( 2011b ) , padmanabhan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and anderson et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .    given a sufficiently - large galaxy survey at a redshift @xmath11",
    ", the preferred scale may be detected in both the tangential direction on the sky as an enhancement in the number of galaxy pairs with a given angular separation @xmath21 , and in the radial direction as an excess of pairs with redshift separation @xmath22 .",
    "if these two signals can be simultaneously extracted by measuring galaxy clustering in tangential and radial bins , they respectively carry information about the angular diameter distance @xmath23 and the hubble expansion rate at the survey redshift in units of the standard ruler , @xmath24 \\sim \\delta \\theta$ ] and @xmath25 .",
    "if the galaxy survey only permits the baryon acoustic peak to be detected in the angle - averaged galaxy clustering pattern , then an effective `` dilation scale '' distance is measured which consists of two parts @xmath26 and one part @xmath27 : @xmath28^{1/3}$ ] ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2005 , padmanabhan & white 2008 ) .",
    "the second technique through which large - scale structure surveys permit measurement of geometrical distances is the `` alcock - paczynski ( ap ) test '' ( alcock & paczynski 1979 ) .",
    "the ap test probes the cosmological model by comparing the observed tangential and radial dimensions of objects which are assumed to be isotropic in the correct choice of model .",
    "it can be applied to the 2-point statistics of galaxy clustering if redshift - space distortions , the principal additional source of anisotropy , can be successfully modelled ( ballinger , peacock & heavens 1996 , matsubara & suto 1996 , simpson & peacock 2010 ) . by equating radial and tangential physical scales , independently of any underlying standard ruler , the observable @xmath29 may be determined ( outram et al .",
    "2004 , marinoni & buzzi 2010 , blake et al .",
    "2011c ) .    therefore ,",
    "using a combination of bao and/or ap measurements , large - scale galaxy surveys can supply independent measurements of the distance - redshift relation @xmath26 and expansion history @xmath6 .",
    "we note that the hubble expansion rate as a function of redshift may also be inferred from the relative ages of passively - evolving galaxies ( jimenez & loeb 2002 , stern et al .",
    "2010 , carson & nichol 2010 , moresco et al .",
    "this is a promising technique albeit subject to assumptions about the stellar populations of these galaxies , in particular about galaxy metallicity at high redshift .",
    "we focus here on distance measurements using the wigglez dark energy survey ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2010 ) , which was designed to extend the study of large - scale structure over large cosmic volumes to redshifts @xmath30 .",
    "the study presented here builds upon two existing distance - scale measurements using the wigglez dataset : blake et al .",
    "( 2011b ) reported the measurement of the angle - averaged baryon acoustic peak at redshifts @xmath31 , and blake et al .",
    "( 2011c ) applied the alcock - paczynski test to the 2d clustering power spectrum . in this latter study",
    "we combined the ap fits with sne data to estimate the hubble parameter relative to its local value , @xmath32 .",
    "we here extend these analyses by combining the wigglez measurements of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , including a calculation of the covariance of the statistics , to extract measurements of @xmath26 and @xmath6 as a function of redshift , in absolute units independent of the value of @xmath17 , based solely on wigglez survey data ( and a sound - horizon calibration ) .",
    "furthermore , by combining these measurements with sne and other galaxy datasets , we constrain the cosmic expansion rate @xmath6 as a stepwise function in the redshift range @xmath35 , and fit a variety of cosmological models to the results .",
    "the wigglez dark energy survey ( drinkwater et al .  2010 ) is a large - scale redshift survey of bright emission - line galaxies which was carried out at the anglo - australian telescope between august 2006 and january 2011 .",
    "the galaxy sample utilized by this study is drawn from the final set of observations covering about 800 deg@xmath36 of sky in six regions , including a total of @xmath37 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath38 , and is the same dataset as used for the analysis of the baryon acoustic peak by blake et al .",
    "( 2011b ) .",
    "our study is based on measurements of the angle - averaged galaxy correlation function and 2d galaxy power spectrum in tangential and radial fourier bins in three overlapping redshift ranges @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the effective redshifts of the measurements in these three redshift slices are @xmath42 ( blake et al .",
    "we use overlapping , wide redshift ranges in order to ensure a detection of the baryon acoustic peak in each redshift slice ( following percival et al .",
    "2010 ) and to provide the best mapping of the distance - redshift relation .",
    "we account for the correlations between the measurements when fitting models .",
    "blake et al .  ( 2011b ) presented our analysis of the wigglez galaxy correlation function to map the baryon acoustic peak in these three redshift ranges .",
    "the correlation functions contain evidence for the baryon acoustic peak in each redshift slice .",
    "our model for fitting the correlation function measurements to determine the standard - ruler distance is described in section 3.1 of blake et al .",
    "( 2011b ) .",
    "our results are most cleanly expressed as a measurement of the acoustic parameter , @xmath43 at the effective redshift of the sample .",
    "we marginalized over the shape of the clustering pattern ( parameterized by the physical matter density @xmath44 ) , non - linear damping of the acoustic peak , and galaxy bias .",
    "the results for @xmath45 are listed in table [ tabres ] , reproduced from blake et al .",
    "( 2011b ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figure [ fighzcases ] we compare the results of fitting @xmath6 in 5 bins of width @xmath46 to different subsets of the total dataset .",
    "we note that , when combined with a cmb prior , the baryon oscillation scale is calibrated in units of mpc and permits direct measurement of @xmath6 in units of km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "however , given that the normalization of the supernova hubble diagram is treated as an unknown parameter , the sne data yield the relative luminosity distance @xmath47 and require an extra prior in @xmath17 in order to determine the function @xmath6 .",
    "we take this prior as the riess et al .",
    "( 2011 ) @xmath48 determination of the hubble constant using new observations of cepheid variables combined with type ia supernovae and the megamaser host galaxy ngc 4258 , which yields a gaussian prior in @xmath17 of mean @xmath49 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 and standard deviation @xmath50 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "figure [ fighzcases ] illustrates the factor 2 - 3 gain in precision at higher redshifts achieved when adding the wigglez and boss ap measurements , with their direct dependence on @xmath6 , to the existing bao and sne dataset .",
    "it is also notable that the different probes produce consistent determinations of the expansion history within the statistical errors , which are consistent with a flat @xmath14cdm cosmological model with parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "another benefit of using the ap dataset is a reduced covariance between the @xmath6 measurements in different bins , which are heavily correlated when only total distance information is available .",
    "this is illustrated by figure [ fighzcovsn ] , which displays the covariance between the @xmath6 measurements in 5 bins for the case of sne data + @xmath17 prior , illustrating the significantly higher correlation coefficients @xmath53 in comparison with figure [ fighzcovall ] .    in order to illustrate further the consistent results obtained when varying the input datasets we fitted each determination of @xmath6 plotted in figure [ fighzcases ] for the normalization factor @xmath54 , assuming @xmath51 , using the corresponding covariance matrix obtained from the markov chain .",
    "the resulting measurements for the cases ( sne , sne+ap , bao , bao+ap ) were @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "[ we note that the aim here is not to measure @xmath54 , but to demonstrate that analyzing these subsets of the data produces consistent results . ]      finally , we fitted our dataset with a `` kinematical '' cosmological model ( rapetti et al .  2007 ) which is parameterized in terms of the dimensionless second and third derivatives of the scale factor @xmath12 with respect to time , the deceleration parameter @xmath56 and jerk parameter @xmath57 .",
    "in particular , we adopt a parameterization where models are expressed in terms of the present - day value of the deceleration parameter @xmath58 and a constant jerk @xmath59 , noting that @xmath14cdm models correspond to the special case @xmath60 .",

    "we exclude this region from our fits .",
    "figure [ figprobq0j ] illustrates the joint likelihood of kinematical model fits to the bao , ap and sne datasets . as in previous sections , we marginalize over a wmap - inspired gaussian prior in @xmath44 in order to calibrate the baryon oscillation standard ruler .",
    "@xmath14cdm models correspond to the line @xmath60 , and specific values of @xmath70 pick out a point with @xmath71 .",
    "these models are consistent with the data .",
    "we note that sne provide the best constraints on the kinematical model parameters , and that including the wmap distance priors in the fitted dataset produces a very accurate joint constraint on @xmath61 from the precisely - known distance to the last - scattering surface , although this corresponds to a significant extrapolation of the validity of the model from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "fitting to the combination of sne , bao and ap data , not including the cmb , produces marginalized parameter measurements @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we have used large - scale structure measurements from the wigglez dark energy survey to perform joint fits for the baryon - oscillation distance scale quantified by the acoustic parameter @xmath76^{1/3}$ ] , the alcock - paczynski distortion parameter @xmath77 and the normalized growth rate @xmath78 in three overlapping redshift slices with effective redshifts @xmath31 .",
    "we use lognormal realizations to quantify the covariances between parameters and redshift slices , producing a @xmath79 covariance matrix .    by combining the joint measurements of @xmath45 and @xmath80 taking into account the covariance , we performed simultaneous determinations of the angular - diameter distance @xmath26 and hubble parameter @xmath6 based only on the wigglez survey dataset and a wmap prior in the matter density @xmath44 to calibrate the baryon oscillation standard ruler .",
    "these results are generally insensitive to the fiducial cosmological model including spatial curvature .",
    "we measure these parameters with @xmath81 accuracy in each redshift bin .",
    "we use a combined dataset consisting of these joint wigglez geometric measurements , other bao data and sne luminosity distances to perform a monte carlo markov chain determination of the expansion history @xmath6 as a stepwise function in 9 redshift bins of width @xmath7 , also marginalizing over spatial curvature @xmath82 .",
    "the results are consistent with a flat @xmath14cdm cosmological model with parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the addition of the ap data reduces both the errors in these measurements [ through its direct sensitivity to @xmath6 ] and the covariance between different redshift bins .",
    "when we convert our results to a measurement of the cosmic expansion rate @xmath84 , we see a significant decrease in the value of @xmath85 between redshifts @xmath86 and @xmath87 , corresponding to accelerating cosmic expansion .",
    "measurements of the statistic @xmath88 ^ 2 - 1    \\right ] / \\left [ ( 1+z)^3 - 1 \\right]$ ] are constant with redshift , consistent with a spatially - flat @xmath14cdm model with matter density parameter @xmath89 .",
    "we compare our measurements to cosmological models including different dark energy equations - of - state @xmath90 and kinematical models expressed in terms of the derivatives of the cosmic scale factor , the deceleration and jerk parameters .",
