    "the atlas trigger system is divided into two main parts : the level 1 ( lvl1 )  @xcite , hardware - based trigger , and the high level trigger ( hlt )  @xcite , using software selection algorithms .",
    "the hardware implementation of the lvl1 trigger is determined by very strong constraints in the processing time due to the high bunch - crossing rate of 40 mhz .",
    "only a few @xmath1 are available for the decision making at this level . due to the rate reduction achieved at lvl1 more decision time",
    "is allowed in the two stages of selection at the hlt : a few tens of milliseconds at the level 2 trigger ( lvl2 ) , and a few seconds at the event filter ( ef ) . in this section a brief description of the tau trigger will be presented .",
    "the lvl1 trigger  @xcite uses trigger towers @xmath2=0.1@xmath30.1 within the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter to identify regions of interest ( roi ) to be investigated further in the hlt .",
    "the following quantities are used to select lvl1 features giving rise to a roi , see fig .",
    "[ l1scheme ] : a ) energy in 2@xmath31 pairs of em towers within a 2@xmath32 core region ; b ) energy in a 2@xmath32 group of hadronic towers behind the em core ; c ) energy in a 12 tower em isolation ring surrounding the central 2@xmath32 core ; d ) energy in a similar ring in the hadronic calorimeter .",
    "relatively low thresholds are applied at lvl1 and are subsequently refined at the hlt .",
    "triggers can be defined with and without an isolation requirement .",
    "due to the greater time available for decisions at the hlt , the cluster information can be refined using the full granularity of the calorimeter in conjunction with a cell energy calibration and tracking information from the inner detector can be included  @xcite .",
    "the characteristics used to distinguish tau decays from particle jets are :    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     figure  [ effest ] ( left ) shows the tau20i lvl1 trigger signature efficiency with respect to the offline selection for the qcd jets selected by a minimum bias trigger and passing the tau offline selection . a comparison with the lvl1 trigger efficiency for @xmath4 is also shown .",
    "figure  [ effest ] ( right ) shows the full trigger efficiency using a tag & probe method .",
    "the z sample is selected via single electron or muon triggers .",
    "after offline selection , the trigger lepton is used as a tag and the other side of the event is probed for a tau trigger candidate , and the efficiency of the tau trigger relative to offline reconstruction is measured .",
    "both methods reproduce the shape and threshold of the trigger turn - on curves , but further work is needed to improve the background estimation and to gain a better understanding of the bias introduced by the event selection .",
    "many of the sm processes being investigated at atlas , as well as numerous bsm searches , contain tau leptons in their final states .",
    "being able to trigger effectively on the tau leptons in these events will contribute to the success of the atlas experiment .",
    "the tau trigger algorithms and monitoring infrastructure are ready for the first data , and are being tested with the data collected with cosmic muons .",
    "the development of efficiency measurements methods using qcd and @xmath5 events is well advanced ."

    "<S> , the identification of tau leptons , in particular in the hadronic decay mode , will be a challenging task due to an overwhelming qcd background which gives rise to jets of particles that can be hard to distinguish from hadronic tau decays . </S>",
    "<S> equipped with excellent tracking and calorimetry , the atlas experiment has developed tau identification tools capable of working at the trigger level . </S>",
