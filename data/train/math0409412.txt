    "intersection homology is the correct theory to extend results from manifolds to singular varieties : e.g. , morse theory , lefschetz ( weak and hard ) theorems , hodge decompositions , but especially poincar duality ( which motivates the theory ) .",

    "then @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of components of @xmath0 , and one proceeds , as in classical knot theory , to define alexander - type invariants of the hypersurface @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , the rational homology groups of any infinite cyclic cover of @xmath5 become , under the action of the group of covering transformations , modules over the ring @xmath16 of rational laurent polynomials .",
    "the modules @xmath8 associated to the infinite cyclic cover @xmath7 defined by the kernel of the total linking number homomorphism , are called _ the alexander modules of the hypersurface complement_. note that , since @xmath5 has the homotopy type of a finite cw complex of dimension @xmath17 , the alexander modules @xmath18 are trivial for @xmath19 and @xmath20 is @xmath16-free .",

    "libgober showed ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) that if @xmath0 has only isolated singularities ( including at infinity ) , then @xmath21 for @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is a torsion @xmath16-module .",
