    "the effects of substitutions of magnetic impurities on the antiferromagnetic spin chain have attracted great interests in the past decade .",
    "it has been shown theoretically that the ground state properties vary with different dilution cases .",
    "for the random substitutions , the most interested case is of the s=1/2 impurities in haldane chain @xcite .",
    "for example , inelastic neutron scattering experiment on the compound y@xmath4banio@xmath5 substituting ca@xmath6 for ni@xmath6 @xcite show a substantial increase of the spectral function below the haldane gap to indicate the creation of states below the energy of the spin gap .",
    "this effects are also studied by numerical works by s. wessel @xcite . for regular substitutions ,",
    "these systems are the mixed - spin chains which have been extensively studied by many authors in the past a few years .",
    "analytical methods of non - linear sigma model , mean field theory and spin - wave method @xcite as well as numerical works by density matrix renormalization group @xcite and quantum monte carlo @xcite have been applied extensively for such systems .",
    "so far , it is well known that the topology of spin arrangements in the mixed chains plays an essential role on the ground state properties and thermodynamics in the mixed - spin systems .",
    "experimently , many quasi-1d mixed - spin materials have been synthesized in the past two decades , such as acu(pba)(h@xmath4 o)@xmath7 @xmath8 n(h@xmath4 o ) and acu(pbaoh)(h@xmath4 o)@xmath7 @xmath8 nh@xmath4o ( where pba=1,3-propylenebis(oxamato),pbaoh=2-hydroxo-1,3-propylenebis and a= ni , fe , co , mn , zn ) .",
    "these materials contains two different transition metal ions per unit cell , and their properties were studied as ferrimagnetic chains @xcite .",
    "the experiment results imply that the magnetic properties of the mixed - spin compounds can all be described by a heisenberg model with nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling as @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes a spin-@xmath11 moment at site @xmath12 , @xmath13 is system size and @xmath14",
    ". t. fukui and n. kawakami @xcite have studied spin chain composed by a periodic array of impurities @xmath1 embedded in the host @xmath15 spin chain with the period @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17    the dilutions of the model denoted by the impurity concentration @xmath18 has two limits : ( _ i _ ) @xmath19 , the undoped pure antiferromagnetic @xmath20 chain , it has a non - magnetic ground state ; ( _ ii _ ) @xmath21 , the alternating spin chain of @xmath1 and @xmath20 . according to marshall theorem and lieb - schultz - mattis ( lsm ) theorem @xcite , ground state of the doped cases",
    "are specified by the spin quantum number @xmath22 for @xmath23 or @xmath24 , it is either a spin singlet or ferrimagnetic .",
    "if the effective spin in a unit composed of @xmath16 spins @xmath25 is half - integer , so the system has a gapless energy spectrum .",
    "but when @xmath25 is integer , lsm theorem fails to predict the energy spectrum to be gaped or gapless .",
    "by applying non - linear @xmath26 model , it is found that the system has an energy gap when the @xmath25 is integer@xcite . but",
    "details of ground state properties and thermodynamics can not be given by non - linear @xmath26 model analyses .",
    "the authors of present paper have recently studied the model ( 1 ) with the case of @xmath27 and @xmath28 by applying quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , where the numerical results reveal different non - trivial magnetic properties happened between two kinds of diluting cases , i.e. for @xmath29 @xmath28 spins in a unit , system has magnetic ground state and it shows ferrimagnetic features ; while for @xmath24 @xmath28 spins in a unit , systems behave non - magnetic ground states with antiferromagnetic - like features . for both the @xmath30 cases ,",
    "the ground states are _ gapless _ steadily .",
    "and the system gradually transits from the ferrimagnetic ground state of the alternating @xmath1-@xmath20 chain to the disordered ground state of pure @xmath31 chain in two different tendencies . in this letter , we study an opposite case with @xmath0 and @xmath32 .",
    "previous analytical work predicted that if @xmath29 @xmath32 spins in a unit , the effective spin @xmath25 is half - integer , the ground state is ferrimagnetic with a gapless energy spectrum ; while if @xmath24 @xmath32 in a unit , @xmath25 is integer , the ground state is non - magnetic and the system has an energy gap .",
    "our numerical study will focus on how the ground state properties depend on the concentration and the finite temperature magnetic properties evolute with decreasing of the @xmath0 concentration @xmath18 .",
    "we use the efficient continuous imaginary time version of loop cluster algorithm to perform the quantum monte carlo simulation @xcite , which has been successfully applied for the other mixed - spin chains @xcite .",
    "we confine our calculation to isotropic antiferromagnetic coupling cases , i.e. @xmath33 in equation ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , and the positions of spin @xmath34 and @xmath35 are arranged as represented in equation ( [ spin_arrange ] ) with @xmath16 taking the values from 2 to 11 .",
    "we carry out @xmath36 monte carlo steps for measuring physical quantities after @xmath37 monte carlo steps for the thermalization . in order to clearly explore the ground state properties ,",
    "the simulations are performed at the very low temperature @xmath38 for system sizes @xmath39 in condition of even number of unit .",
    "the physical quantities we measure are the ground state energy @xmath40 , the uniform magnetic susceptibility @xmath41 and staggered susceptibility @xmath42 by using the improved estimators in the loop cluster algorithm , e.g. , @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is winding number of cluster @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the cluster size .",
    "the magnetization and staggered magnetization are estimated by @xmath48 and @xmath49 the energy gap @xmath50 is also estimated in the way given by todo , @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the correlation length in the imaginary time direction .    the results for magnetizations and uniform susceptibility are plotted in fig .",
    "[ mz ] and fig .",
    "[ sus_u ] .",
    "we find that the magnetic properties are apparently different for two cases of @xmath23 and @xmath53 .",
    "when @xmath53 , the magnetization is finite and approaches zero linearly with decreasing of @xmath18 . while @xmath23 , the magnetization remains almost at zero value .",
    "on the other hand , it can be observed from our results that the uniform susceptibilities @xmath41 is finite for @xmath53 , but it vanishes when @xmath23 .",
    "thus there is magnetic long - range order ( lro ) in the ground state when @xmath53 , but the order is absent when @xmath53 .",
    "we further estimate the staggered magnetization and its susceptibility as a function of concentration shown in fig .",
    "[ smz ] and fig .",
    "[ sus_s ] respectively .",
    "the two observables are both finite for @xmath23 and @xmath53 cases , but the data for the cases of @xmath53 have much stronger values than the cases of @xmath23 .    in order to confirm the results observed above , we begin to investigate the finite temperature uniform magnetic susceptibility . as displayed in fig .",
    "[ sus_t ] ,    one can easily find that @xmath41 diverges when the temperature @xmath54 goes to zero in the cases @xmath53 .",
    "this is the typical behavior of a system with magnetic lro . in the cases",
    "@xmath23 , all the @xmath41 approach zero when @xmath55 , a remarkable evidence to reveal the existence of the energy gap .",
    "up to now , our results verify numerically that there are magnetic lro and antiferromagnetic lro in the ground states when @xmath53 .",
    "they clearly show that the ground states are ferrimagnetic in such cases . while for @xmath23 , there should exist of spin liquid phases denoted by the vanish of the magnetizations .",
    "consequently we believe our numerical results consist correctly with the previous analytical predictions .",
    "more important , one can easily see that the magnetism decreases with decreasing of impurity concentration in the case of @xmath53 .",
    "but there is not notable change of the magnetic properties when the @xmath0 concentration decreases as @xmath23 .",
    "next , we consider the feature of the energy gap @xmath50 on different regular dilutions .",
    "not surperised for us , the energy gap is closed when @xmath16 is @xmath24 and it opens again while @xmath16 is @xmath29 as shown in fig .",
    "these results is consist with the prediction by non - linear @xmath26 model and lsm theorem @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the energy gap @xmath50 tends to be narrow as decreasing of @xmath0 concentration when @xmath23 .",
    "we confirm such behavior by fitting @xmath50 to the curve of @xmath56 as one can see in fig .",
    "[ gap ] .",
    "moreover , we show the finite - size effect of @xmath50 results for several cases with @xmath57 increasing in fig .",
    "[ size ] . in our estimations",
    ", although the gaps are not exact closed for @xmath53 due to the finite - size simulations , we find the data of the gaps decrease fast than @xmath58 , so it is obvious that the gaps will trend to zero as @xmath59 . for the cases @xmath23 , where the gap opens all the time , there is almost no finite - size effect .    in order to identify the ground state phases , we calculate the valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) @xcite order parameter @xmath60\\rangle,\\ ] ]    according to the lsm theorem , @xmath61 vanishes in the gapless phase as system size @xmath62 . on the other hand ,",
    "one expects that @xmath61 varies in between @xmath63 but @xmath64 in a given gaped phase . in exact vbs states , @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "our calculations are plotted in fig .",
    "it is clear that @xmath66 for all cases of @xmath23 to present the system located in a vbs phase ; while @xmath67 , it reveals the gapless energy spectrum for all @xmath53 cases .",
    "especially , all these ground state phases can be understood under the scenario of vbs picture . in vbs picture ,",
    "each impurity @xmath0 can be regarded as two spin-1/2 in a triplet state , these two spin-1/2 can form singlet with their nearest neighbor s=1/2 spin due to the antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "when @xmath23 , each unit have _ even _ number of s=1/2 host spins , so they can fall into singlets with their nearest neighbors including the two spin-1/2 of @xmath31 to induce the vbs order as seen in fig .",
    "[ illus_1 ] ( a ) . as a result",
    ", the system now shows a gaped energy spectrum .",
    "= 3.5 cm    but for @xmath53 , _ odd _ number of spin-1/2 exist in a unit and there will be an active spin which is not used to form singlet as shown in fig .",
    "[ illus_1](b ) , thus there is no vbs order and the system emerges no spin gap .",
    "our results of the vbs order parameter @xmath61 clearly verify this picture , @xmath68 when @xmath23 and @xmath67 when @xmath53 as shown in fig .",
    "[ vbs ] . at last",
    ", we note that the vbs phase is stable with the variation of @xmath0 concentration @xmath18 when @xmath23 .",
    "our monte carlo study verifies that two brunches of different magnetic behaviors emerge in cases of regular s=1 diluted s=1/2 host chains . according marshall theorem , the cases with @xmath53 have the ferrimagnetic ground states which can be specified by quantum number @xmath69 , so the magnetization per site is finite and it decreases linearly as a function of @xmath18 to @xmath70 , the case of the pure s=1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain .",
    "this feature can be easily observed from our results in fig .",
    "[ mz ] and fig .",
    "when @xmath16 is @xmath29 , the ground state is singlet with @xmath71 , thus the magnetization per site keeps zero and this is a non - magnetic state .",
    "as observed in our simulations there is no notable variations of the ground state magnetic properties in the cases of @xmath23 .    to compare our ground state results of the model in this letter for @xmath0 and @xmath32 ( _ system i _ ) with the one we studied previously @xcite when @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( _ system ii _ )",
    ", we collect the main points of the numerical calculations in table i.    .comparison of ground state properties of two model , where @xmath25 is effective spin in a unit , @xmath72m@xmath73 is magnetization , @xmath72m@xmath74@xmath73 is staggered magnetization , @xmath41 is uniform susceptibility , @xmath42 is staggered susceptibility , @xmath50 is energy gap and @xmath61 is vbs order parameter . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     one can easily see that both systems behave with two kinds of different ground state phases , magnetic or non - magnetic , respectively .",
    "if @xmath53 , the ground states are ferrimagnetic for both _ system i _ and _ system ii _ , and their magnetizations and staggered magnetizations are all finite and decrease linearly with decreasing of impurity concentration .",
    "however , for the cases of @xmath23 , there appears vbs order in _",
    "system i _ which is gaped , but the order is absent in _ system ii _ where the spin arrangements can not induce such order , so the gap is constantly closed .",
    "this feature reveals that this topological order plays an important role to the behavior of the energy gap in the mixed - spin system .",
    "we believe that the fitted relation of @xmath75 , to denote the energy gap as function of @xmath0 concentration , provides a good stuff to study how the topological order affects the energy gap in the mixed - spin systems .    in conclusion , we have studied the ground state and finite temperature magnetic properties of the regular @xmath0 diluted in @xmath32 antiferromagnetic chain .",
    "our calculations show that there exist different phases in the ground state as a function of @xmath1 concentration .",
    "when there is one @xmath1 impurity and @xmath29 number of host @xmath20 spins in a unit cell , the ground states are ferrimagnetic and the system has a gapless energy spectrum . the ferrimagnetism becomes weaker as the impurity concentration reduced . while for one @xmath1 and @xmath24 number of @xmath20 in one unit cell , the ground state is a vbs phase where there is a gaped energy spectrum and the energy gap gradually approaches to zero with decreasing the concentration @xmath18 .",
    "an interesting observation is that the behavior of the energy gap can be numerically well fitted by @xmath76 .",
    "further analytical work , for exmaple using the mean - field theory @xcite , is required to explain why such dependence of the energy gap exist in vbs phases .",
