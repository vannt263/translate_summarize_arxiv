    "none of the dynamical models for hadronic interactions that have been constructed in the past to microscopically describe nuclear properties is fundamental .",
    "all models are effective ones ; only the most important hadronic degrees of freedom are taken into account explicitly .",
    "effective theories in general lead to rather complicated forces , including irreducible many - body forces .",
    "the complexity and interpretation of these potentials is closely related to the chosen hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "most often the microscopic theory of nuclear phenomena is formulated in a hilbert space of nucleons only employing nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the potentials are taken to be of two - body nature , the mediating meson fields having been frozen out .",
    "many - meson exchanges and relativistic effects are absorbed into the phenomenological short - range part of the potential that is also introduced to regularize it at the origin .",
    "many - body forces are assumed to be much less important than the dominant two - nucleon force .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , since on average nucleons move relatively slowly inside nuclei , three nucleons rarely interact simultaneously due to the short - range repulsion between two of them , and the rate of nucleonic excitation into nonnucleonic states is low .",
    "the parameters of these semi - phenomenological models are calibrated to reproduce the bound - state and scattering observables of the two - nucleon systems .",
    "therefore , the three - nucleon system offers the first testing ground for the two - nucleon potentials .",
    "can a hamiltonian with only two - nucleon potentials successfully describe the trinucleon properties or not ? the qualitative and quantitative effects of three - nucleon forces must be understood .",
    "the derivation of realistic two - nucleon potentials has been steadily improved in the past .",
    "see the very good review of ref .",
    "@xcite on this subject .",
    "furthermore , the techniques to solve the three - nucleon bound - state problem have reached maturity , the vast progress became possible by the rapid advances of computational power .",
    "the trinucleon calculations made it clear that no realistic two - nucleon potential is able to reproduce the known hadronic and e.m.properties of @xmath3 and @xmath4 with satisfactory accuracy .",
    "e.g. , the triton binding energy obtained from such two - nucleon hamiltonians turns out to be about 1 mev below its experimental value .",
    "calculations of @xmath5 show a similar deficiency in binding energy @xcite .",
    "thus , three - nucleon forces have to provide additional net attraction in order to close the gap between theoretical prediction for and experimental value of nuclear binding energies .    two strategies for introducing three - nucleon forces have been investigated : in the first one a three - nucleon potential is designed to be added to a conventional hamiltonian with two - nucleon potentials @xcite . in the second one , the role of nucleonic excitation in generating three - nucleon forces is recognized : e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite three - nucleon forces are obtained by the explicit inclusion of a @xmath6 isobar in an extended hilbert space .",
    "it came as a surprise that both strategies yield rather different trinucleon binding energies , even when the underlying physical processes are thought to be comparable .",
    "an attempt to combine the two approaches has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite where also their respective advantages and disadvantages are discussed .",
    "the present paper reports on triton calculations with a new three - nucleon force @xcite that belongs to the first strategy .",
    "like all modern realistic two - nucleon potentials , the models for a three - nucleon force are based on meson exchange . since nucleons are kept apart by short - range two - nucleon repulsion ,",
    "the two - pion ( @xmath7 ) exchange part of the three - nucleon force is expected to be dominant .",
    "several @xmath7 exchange three - nucleon potentials have been worked out . when used in triton calculations they provide ample additional binding energy . however , in contrast to expectation , its effect is strongly dependent on the cut - off parameter @xmath8 entering the regularizing form factor at the @xmath0nn vertices , i.e. , it is dependent on non - pion physics .",
    "these purely phenomenological form factors are usually taken either in monopole or in square root parametrization . since the same vertex also enters all models of the two - nucleon and the pion - nucleon potentials , both nucleon - nucleon and pion - nucleon scattering",
    "have been used to extract the value of the cut - off parameter @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , the answer is not unique .",
    "the two - nucleon potentials seem to demand `` hard '' form factors with a @xmath8 of about 1.2 gev , whereas the analysis of @xmath0n scattering favors `` soft '' ones with @xmath8 typically around 800 mev ( for a discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "when such a soft form factor is employed in a @xmath7 exchange three - nucleon potential , the triton turns out to be already overbound .",
    "further increase of @xmath8 leads to unphysically large binding energies well before @xmath8 reaches the characteristic values for hard form factors .",
    "it is well known from two - nucleon potentials that the exchange of a @xmath1 meson cancels to some extent the medium range part of the one - pion exchange tensor force , providing an important medium range repulsion to the two - nucleon potential .",
    "this cancellation also reduces the cut - off dependence of the two - nucleon potential .",
    "thus , the inclusion of @xmath1 exchange into three - nucleon force models should lead to less cut - off dependent results and simultaneously to a smaller overall contribution of the three - nucleon force to the triton binding energy . in the context of strategy 2 for the three - nucleon force",
    "this hope was confirmed already a long time ago @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 contributions to three - nucleon potentials were derived already in @xcite . due to the enormous technical difficulties",
    "it is only now that they are being included in exact triton calculations .",
    "first results with the brazilian three - nucleon potential were presented in ref .",
    "they display the desired repulsive effect of the @xmath1 exchange on the triton binding , but do not study its cut - off dependence , since the authors were only interested in determining parameter combinations that fit the experimental three - nucleon binding energy .",
    "recently , coon and pea @xcite reexamined and improved the @xmath9 and @xmath10 exchange three - nucleon potential @xcite that was developed by the tucson - melbourne group as an extension of their @xmath7 exchange three - nucleon potential @xcite .",

    "@xcite was the partial wave decomposition of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 exchange three - nucleon potentials , since their structure is considerably more complex than that of the @xmath48 exchange potential .",

    "@xcite , took about 90 minutes of cpu time .",

    "[ tfull ] the results for the reid soft core @xcite , paris @xcite , nijmegen @xcite , and bonn obepq @xcite as underlying two - nucleon potentials are given .",
    "we consider these potentials as representative for various approaches to modeling the two - nucleon force : they are purely phenomenological , based on dispersion theory , non - relativistic and derived from one - boson exchange , and derived from one - boson exchange with minimal relativity , respectively .    the binding energies obtained with the complete @xmath0 and @xmath1 exchange tucson - melbourne three - nucleon potentials ( which we hereafter shorthand as `` full results '' ) scatter closely around the experimental triton binding energy of -8.482 mev .",
    "the only exception occurs in the case of the bonn obepq potential , which comes close to that value already without any three - nucleon force .",
    "the full result for the paris potential happens to deviate from the experimental value by only 12 kev .",
    "as expected , the @xmath46 three - nucleon potential decreases the trinucleon binding energy , compensating to a large extent the overbinding due to the @xmath48 potential alone .",
    "we also observe that the @xmath10 potential has only a small effect .",
    "for the @xmath6 mediated three - nucleon force of the hannover model , it was found already many years ago @xcite that the @xmath9 exchange weakens the attraction due to the @xmath7 exchange and that the contribution of the @xmath10 exchange is rather small .",
    "these findings are also in good qualitative agreement with the results obtained by sasakawa _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite for the simpler brazilian three - nucleon potentials . however , we want to point out that the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite were performed with a different two - nucleon potential , that they include only the @xmath6 part of the @xmath10 potential , and that the implemented functional form of the @xmath1 form factors as well as the values of the @xmath1 cut - off parameters are very different from ours . that the effect of the @xmath10 potential in our calculations can be attractive or repulsive , depending on the employed two - nucleon potential , while ref .",
    "@xcite reports only repulsion , is therefore not inconsistent .",
    "however , one should not take the impressive agreement of theoretical binding energies with experiment too seriously , even though no attempt was made to adjust any parameters of the three - nucleon potential in order to reproduce the experimental trinucleon binding energy .",
    "one should keep in mind that the exact values of the cut - off parameters @xmath49 are not well determined , although some arguments have been given @xcite favoring the set of parameters listed in table  [ tparameters ] .",
    "in particular , the recommended value for the @xmath2 vertex , @xmath50 mev , is based on an analysis of the goldberger - treiman relation @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties associated with the extrapolation of the physical constants in the goldberger - treiman relation to their chiral - limit values are estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite to yield a `` theoretical error bar '' of about @xmath51 mev for @xmath8 , an uncertainty which creates substantial variation in the calculated triton binding energy .    since it is known already from previous studies with the @xmath7 exchange three - nucleon force @xcite that the results are strongly dependent on the cut - off @xmath8 it is certainly necessary to reexamine that dependence for the full three - nucleon force .",
    "each full calculation still requiring enormous computational capacities , we had to restrict ourselves to a small number of combinations of the cut - off parameters . nevertheless , the studied variation is sufficient to draw some qualitative conclusions .",
    "the variation of @xmath8 is performed using the same values as before in the study of the @xmath48 exchange three - nucleon force @xcite .",
    "for the cut - off parameters connected with the @xmath1 meson we consider just two cases , i.e. , on one hand soft form factors , represented by the tucson - melbourne choice @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and on the other hand hard form factors as suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite , with @xmath54 .",
    "these two choices of @xmath1 cut - off parameters have also been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results with the paris potential as two - nucleon potential are shown in table [ tcutoff ] and in figure 4 .",
    "the strong dependence on @xmath8 is considerably reduced once the @xmath9 part is added to the three - nucleon force , although the remaining dependence is still sizeable .",
    "changing the @xmath55 cut - off parameters from `` soft '' to `` hard '' values also alters the triton binding energy : the effect of the @xmath10 part is significantly enhanced for hard form factors .",
    "it is repulsive and greater than 200 kev ( for @xmath56 ) , whereas it is less than 10 kev and attractive for soft form factors .",
    "however , there are indications that the use of hard @xmath1 cut - off parameters in the tucson - melbourne potential does not lead to physically meaningful results .",
    "although our primary reference two - nucleon potential is the paris potential , we repeated a calculation with hard @xmath55 cut - off parameters also for the reid potential .",
    "we found that the @xmath10 potential becomes so strong that no converged trinucleon binding energy could be obtained ( for @xmath56 ) .",
    "apparently , there are strong and model - dependent cancellations between different components of the @xmath10 potential which happen to reduce to a comparably small net result in the case of the paris potential , while for other potentials they can diverge .",
    "a similar problem occurs already when only the @xmath7 potential is considered : while stable trinucleon binding energies for the reid and paris potentials can be obtained when @xmath57 , they diverge for nijmegen or bonn potentials .",
    "we see two possible interpretations of these divergencies for hard cut - off parameters .",
    "either the tucson - melbourne parametrization of the three - nucleon force is valid and there are physical reasons to favor soft form factors . or the tucson - melbourne potentials are _ mathematically _ not well defined for hard form factors , i.e. , in the course of solving the three - nucleon equations the tucson - melbourne potentials are evaluated outside their range of convergence associated with various taylor expansions that are employed in their derivation .",
    "we believe it would be important to further investigate these questions . however , it is not the purpose of this paper , in which we rather want to focus on the original parametrization of the tucson - melbourne potentials .",
    "the use of the updated parameters of the tucson - melbourne potential instead of the ones of table [ tparameters ] changes the triton binding energy by very little .",
    "the check was carried out by a complete recalculation for the entry -8.494 mev under @xmath58 soft with @xmath59 for the paris potential in table [ tcutoff ] .",
    "the updated parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , in the @xmath48 part of the three - nucleon potential change the triton binding energy from -8.494 mev to -8.465 mev .",
    "the subsequent modification of the factor @xmath35 in the isospin - odd @xmath6 part of the @xmath9 potential in ( [ eprd- ] ) to the new prescription , discussed at the end of sect .",
    "ii , changes the value of -8.465 mev to -8.492 mev . clearly , the found changes are small , in particular if compared to the sensitivity of the results to variations of the cut - off parameters .",
    "table [ texpect ] lists expectation values of the various components of the tucson - melbourne three - nucleon potentials .",
    "these components are terms of different spin- , isospin- , and momentum dependence . in the @xmath7 part of the three - mucleon potential",
    "they are labeled by their respective coefficients @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath60 . in the case of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 potential they originate from distinct physical processes and are characterized accordingly as @xmath6 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "here @xmath6 stands for the contributions originating from the @xmath6 resonance , whereas @xmath61 and @xmath62 refer to the terms obtained from the kroll - ruderman and bg low - energy theorems @xcite .",
    "the superscripts @xmath63 indicate their isospin symmetry under particle exchange .",
    "the expectation values are calculated with the fully correlated wave functions , i.e. , they are obtained from the full hamiltonian including the full three - nucleon potentials .",
    "they represent therefore true expectation values and not results from first order perturbation theory .",
    "in fact , a comparison of the expectation values with the corresponding binding energy differences demonstrates again the non - perturbative character of these calculations .",
    "it can be seen that the unproportionally strong overbinding for the obepq potential is mainly caused by the @xmath33-term of the @xmath7 potential .",
    "there seems to be a correlation between the magnitudes of the expectation values and the probabilities of the wave function components .",
    "as one moves from left to right in table [ texpect ] , the triton @xmath64 state probabilities decrease whereas the absolute values of the total @xmath7 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 contributions increase .",
    "the same trend holds also for most of the individual contributions .    in the @xmath7 part of the three - nucleon potential , several physical processes lead to terms of the same spin - isospin and momentum structure",
    "they are usually not separated in order to emphasize the model - independent character of the potential .",
    "however , it is interesting to see how the three - nucleon potential is composed of physical processes , even if a certain model dependence is introduced . in ref .",
    "@xcite the four coefficients of the @xmath7 potential are split into different parts according to their physical origin .",
    "there , the given numerical values are based on the updated set of parameters .",
    "since we are working with the original set of parameters , we have to recalculate this splitting accordingly .",
    "this is the reason why our values ( [ ed ] ) are not identical to those of @xcite .",
    "the coefficients are decomposed as @xmath65 with the numerical values @xmath66 the subscripts @xmath6 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , refer to @xmath6-isobar , @xmath67-term , and z - graph contributions ; @xmath69 is a `` current algebra '' term @xcite .",
    "it represents a ( isovector ) vector - current contribution to the @xmath34 amplitude which the three - nucleon potential is based on . in a simple vector - meson dominance model it reduces to a t - channel @xmath1 exchange part of the @xmath34 amplitude .    in this context",
    "it may be worth mentioning that not only the extraction of @xmath6 contributions is model dependent , but also the separation into z - graph and @xmath67-term . in the tucson - melbourne @xmath34 amplitude",
    ", pure pseudoscalar @xmath2 coupling is assumed .",
    "the separation into z - graph and @xmath67-term would change if pseudovector coupling were introduced .",
    "the expectation values of table [ texpect ] are reorganized according to this analysis and displayed in table [ tsplit ] .",
    "the upper half contains only the results from the @xmath7 potential , the lower half adds the respective pieces from the @xmath9 and @xmath10 potentials .",
    "the kroll - ruderman term is part of what is called z - graph contributions , because as in the @xmath7 potential pseudoscalar @xmath2 coupling is assumed .",
    "the bg term is counted as a `` current algebra '' contribution , since it originates from t - channel 3@xmath1 and @xmath70 contact terms .",
    "the @xmath67-term appears only in the @xmath7 potential .",
    "the corresponding expectation values are therefore identical in the upper and lower half of the table",
    ".    the @xmath6 and @xmath67-term contributions are both attractive and comparable in magnitude in the @xmath7 potential . in the @xmath9 potential , however , the @xmath6 parts yield relatively strong repulsion , thus canceling to some extent the attraction they produce in the @xmath7 potential .",
    "the z - graph expectation values turn out to be small and repulsive , most of which is due to the kroll - ruderman term in the @xmath9 potential .",
    "the current algebra term is similar in magnitude but opposite in sign .",
    "again , the results obtained with the obepq potential take on rather extreme values . for the paris potential ,",
    "the expectation values of the @xmath6 parts are quite similar to the ones obtained with the @xmath6 mediated three - nucleon force presented in table 3 of ref .",
    "we have solved the faddeev equations with a new set of tucson - melbourne three - nucleon potentials , based on @xmath0 and @xmath1 exchange , together with realistic two - nucleon potentials for the three - nucleon bound state .",
    "we find that the @xmath9 exchange three - nucleon potential is repulsive and counteracts the too strong attraction generated by the @xmath7 potential to such an extent that the resulting triton binding energies for the reid soft core , the paris , and the nijmegen potentials are close to the experimental value .",
    "this is not true for the bonn obepq potential which yields overbinding of more than 1 mev .",
    "the strong dependence of the binding energy on the @xmath2 vertex cutoff parameter @xmath8 that was observed for the tucson - melbourne @xmath7 exchange three - nucleon potential is reduced once the @xmath1 exchange is added .",
    "the @xmath10 exchange potential has only a small effect on the triton binding energy as long as the vertex form factors are not chosen to be `` hard '' .",
    "we have calculated expectation values of the various components of the three - nucleon potentials .",
    "they are presented in two different ways : first they are grouped according to their spin - isospin and momentum dependence , and second they are rearranged to exhibit the relative strength of the underlying physical processes .",
    "we find that the contributions from the @xmath67-term and from @xmath6 excitations are dominant and attractive , compared to which the repulsive effect of intermediate z - graphs is small .",
    "it is the @xmath67-term part of the @xmath7 potential that appears to be very sensitive to details of the three - nucleon wave function and that leads to the unusually strong overbinding in the case of the bonn obepq potential .    in the derivation of three - nucleon potentials ,",
    "vertex functions are usually expanded in powers of particle momenta .",
    "the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath60 parts of the @xmath7 potential are terms two orders higher in the pion momenta than the @xmath31 term .",
    "the fact that they yield considerably larger expectation values in the triton might indicate a failure of the momentum expansion . such a failure could simultaneously be responsible for the observed strong dependence on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cut - off parameters .",
    "that the effect of the @xmath9 three - nucleon potential , although already much smaller than that of the @xmath7 potential , is still of non - negligible size suggests that other exchange processes involving heavier mesons , such as @xmath71 and @xmath72 exchange , should also be investigated . since @xmath67 and @xmath73 exchange",
    "are included in most one - boson exchange two - nucleon potentials , they should also be included in three - nucleon potentials already for reasons of consistency .",
    "these processes have been found to be important in @xmath0 production on two - nucleon systems at threshold ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we thank s.  a.  coon and m.  t.  pea for many helpful discussions on details of the tucson - melbourne three - nucleon potentials .",
