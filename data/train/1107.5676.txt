    "since the behavior of many networked dynamical processes is closely related with the laplacian eigenvalues ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , it is of interest to study the relationship between structural features of the network and its laplacian eigenvalues .    in this technical note",

    "<S> using methods from algebraic graph theory and convex optimization , we study the relationship between local structural features of a network and spectral properties of its laplacian matrix . in particular , we derive expressions for the so - called spectral moments of the laplacian matrix of a network in terms of a collection of local structural measurements . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we propose a series of semidefinite programs to compute bounds on the spectral radius and the spectral gap of the laplacian matrix from a truncated sequence of laplacian spectral moments . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the laplacian spectral moments and spectral radius are strongly constrained by local structural features of the network . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate how local structural features are usually not enough to estimate the laplacian spectral gap . </S>"
