    "the discovery by spite & spite ( 1982 ) of a plateau in the li abundances in metal - poor stars has been followed by much research to determine li in many additional ancient halo stars and to derive the primordial li abundance produced by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) ( e.g. thorburn 1994 , bonifacio & molaro 1997 , ryan et al .  1999 , 2000 ,",

    "( 2001 ) pose a question about the blue straggler phenomenon which essentially is : why should the processes that form blue stragglers be limited only to those stars that have masses _ above _ the turn - off for main sequence stars ?",

    "the phenomenon involving mass transfer and mergers could be at work in lower - mass , sub - turnoff stars as well .",

    "pritchet & glaspey ( 1991 ) conclude that the blue straggler formation must be due to binary coalescence , binary mass transfer , or other deep mixing .",
    "such stars would be thoroughly mixed .",
    "all three light elements , li , be , and b , would be destroyed in this scenario as all the atoms of these elements would be subjected to temperatures where they would be destroyed by nuclear reactions .",
    "preston & sneden ( 2000 ) argue that most field blue stragglers are produced by mass transfer events because collisions are less common in the field than in clusters .",
    "the former - giant primary that transfers the mass would deposit li - depleted deep envelope material onto the current primary .",
    "our measurement of a(be ) and thorburn s ( 1994 ) measurement of a(li ) show that both li and be are severely depleted  if present at all . we may be observing a star that is a blue - straggler - to - be .",
    "it does not have the mass to have evolved beyond the main sequence , yet it has the signature of a coalesced binary or mass transfer in its li and be deficiencies .",
    "latham et al .  (",
    "2002 ) did not find a period for g 186 - 26 .",
    "the carney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) radial velocity measurements show a variation from @xmath2317.78 to @xmath2323.19 km s@xmath10 for a range of 5.41 km s@xmath10 with measurement errors of @xmath200.71 to @xmath201.89 ( or @xmath200.98 , the mean internal error ) .",

    "four additional measurements by latham et al .",

    "there are no signs of double lines in our spectra .",
    "if there has been mass transfer from a former agb star onto g 186 - 26 , it would have left composition signatures .",
    "in particular , sneden , preston & cowan ( 2003 ) have shown that blue stragglers would have overabundances of the s - process elements , sr , ba , and pb . norris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found an overabundance of ba in g 186 - 26 , with [ ba / fe ] = 0.35 .",
    "abundances of many elements in six ultra - li - deficient halo stars were reported by elliott & ryan ( 2005 ) ; they find that sr is overabundant by + 0.5 dex and ba by + 1.0 dex in g 186 - 26 .",
    "norris et al .  (",
    "2001 ) , stephens & boesgaard ( 2002 ) and fulbright ( 2002 ) all find that such an overabundance of [ ba / fe ] is extremely rare at this low [ fe / h ]",
    ".    support for the blue straggler model for the ultra li - deficient stars comes from the apparent lack of be in g 186 - 26 .",
    "additional support for this comes from the super - solar content of neutron - capture elements .",
    "however , there is no evidence that g 186 - 26 is a binary star , but it may be a coalesced binary .      although all the li abundances in the ultra li - deficient stars are upper limits , the presence of be could indicate that rotationally - induced mixing has occurred , but not down to internal temperatures as high as @xmath73.5 x 10@xmath8 k. therefore , abundances of be in the ultra - deficient li halo stars could provide a clue about the efficiency of internal mixing .",
    "that is , if be is found to be present in the ultra - li deficient stars , that would imply that the _ li depletion _ is likely to be due to mixing caused by high initial angular momentum .",
    "the effect of rotationally - induced mixing on the li and be abundances in halo stars was first addressed by pdd92 . according to the standard models",
    ", there is no be depletion ( their tables 3a and 3b ) .",
    "the models which track the instabilities due to spin - down and angular momentum loss do predict depletion of both li and be .",
    "these authors address whether there is a range in initial rotation rates ( i.e. in initial angular momentum ) that results in a range in li at the present epoch .",
    "since li is destroyed at shallower layers than be , this mixing mechanism should produce less be destruction than li destruction , unless mixing is deep enough to deplete both elements substantially .",
    "we have tried to determine the amount of li and be depletion that is predicted for our star by the pdd92 models .",
    "therefore , we have examined the latest `` yale '' isochrones ( yi et al .",
    "2004 ) appropriate for our star s [ fe / h ] , log g , and effective temperature to find the mass for g 186 - 26 .",
    "the 13 gyr isochrone gives a mass of 0.735 m@xmath22 .",
    "tables 5a , 5b , and 5c in pdd92 show the expected depletion for li and be for z = 0.0001 for three values of the initial angular momentum .",
    "we looked at table 5c primarily , in order to find the largest li and be depletions . from our interpolation",
    "we find li depleted from the initial value by @xmath21.21 dex and be by @xmath20.40 dex , compared with at least @xmath20.8 dex in g186 - 26 .",
    "if the initial li is 2.2 dex ( like the current plateau value ) , the present value would be 1.0 dex ; the measured limit on a(li ) by thorburn ( 1994 ) is consistent at @xmath11.1 dex . the initial value for be can be found from the relationship between a(be ) and [ fe / h ] for the iron abundance in g 186 - 26 of [ fe / h ] = @xmath22.71 . from figure 5 of boesgaard",
    "( 1999 ) and figure 10.3 of boesgaard ( 2004 ) we find the initial be was about @xmath21.18 dex and thus the current value would be @xmath21.18 + @xmath20.40 = @xmath21.58 for a(be ) .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show this value in the spectrum synthesis as well as 2 and 4 times more be than that , @xmath22.00 ( 2.6 times less be ) , and zero be . although no be gives the best fit , an upper limit of @xmath22.0 dex is consistent with the noise seen in the continuum and the overall fit of the synthesis .",
    "we note there are uncertainties in the initial be assumed for this star and for the amount of be depletion from the models .",
    "newer models and observations on this issue have been discussed by pinsonneault et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2002 ) .",
    "pinsonneault et al .",
    "( 2002 ) explain that the early models of pdd92 did not take into account that there could be a saturation effect in the loss of angular momentum for the rapidly rotating stars .",
    "they state that the amount of li depletion could not be _ as large as _ the pdd92 rates .",
    "this would likely reduce the amount of be depletion also . the hypothesis that the ultra li - deficient stars were originally part of a group of very rapidly rotating stars which have now spun down , along with some destruction of li and be , is not easy to reconcile with such a low upper limit on a(be ) .",
    "this issue of be abundances should be readdressed with modern models .",
    "the nature of the ultra li - deficient metal - poor stars has been the subject of several papers and is relevant for the determination of the value of primordial li .",
    "two leading hypotheses for the li deficiencies are : ( 1 ) they are analogs to blue stragglers which have lost surface li through binary mass - transfer or mergers .",
    "( 2 ) they are the descendents of a subset of stars with initial rapid rotation that have depleted li by rotationally - induced mixing during spin - down through their evolution . in the blue straggler idea",
    "there would be complete destruction of both li and be .",
    "if extra mixing resulted from rotation , much of the li would be destroyed , but little or no be .",
    "thus be acts as a discriminator between these two hypotheses because it is less fragile than li .",
    "we have made observations of be in a li - deficient , very metal - poor halo star , g 186 - 26 .",

    "the data support the blue straggler hypothesis over rotation .",
    "a coalesced binary and mass transfer episodes could result in the observed of deficits of li and be .    for g 186 - 26",
    "the blue straggler analog fits well , but it is necessary to look at be in other ultra li - deficient , low - metal stars .",
    "to more fully evaluate the rotation hypothesis , new model predictions should be done for be .",
