    "one of the most long - standing puzzles in stellar astrophysics is represented by the observed dichotomy in the mean period of globular cluster ( gc ) rr lyrae variables pulsating in their fundamental mode ( rr0 ) .",
    "this evidence , first discovery by grosse ( 1932 ) and hachenberg ( 1939 ) , was studied by oosterhoff ( 1939 , 1944 ) who noted that gcs can be divided in two groups according to the mean period of their rr0 variables : a first group with @xmath1 ( ooi ) and a second group of clusters with significantly longer mean periods @xmath2 ( ooii ) .",
    "kinman ( 1959 ) noticed that the subdivision of the two groups correlates with the clusters metal content with the ooi group constituted by relatively metal - rich ( @xmath3<-1.0 $ ] ) clusters and the ooii group comprising the most metal - poor ones ( @xmath4<-1.6 $ ] ) .",
    "clusters of the two groups have also differences in their relative fraction of first overtone ( rr1 ) pulsator and different horizontal branch ( hb ) morphologies ( stobie 1971 ) . a third group ( ooiii ) populated by two very metal - rich clusters ( @xmath4\\sim-0.45 $ ] ; ngc6388 and",
    "ngc6441 ) which exhibit a long @xmath5 has been later defined ( pritzl et al . 2000 ) .",
    "only few clusters have a mean rr0 period in the intermediate range @xmath6 ( the so - called `` oosterhoff gap '' ) .",
    "although at the epoch of the original discovery of the oosterhoff dichotomy , the surveys of variable stars were limited to only 5 gcs , its significance has been confirmed in the subsequent years when large samples of rr0 have been observed in many gcs .",
    "the same behavior has been observed among field rr0 populating the galactic halo ( sandage 1982a ; suntzeff , kinman & kraft 1991 ; miceli et al .",
    "2008 ; szczygie , pojmaski & pilecki 2009 ) . for decades",
    "the true nature of the oosterhoff dichotomy has been debated and many solutions have been proposed ( see catelan 2009 for a recent review ) . the first attempts to interpret this evidence focused their attention on the temperature of the edges of the instability strip ( schwarzschild 1957 ) and on the mean luminosity of the hb ( sandage 1957 ) .",
    "both the above interpretations have been subsequently discarded on observational grounds ( sandage 1969 ; stobie 1971 ) . in a long series of papers a. sandage and collaborators investigated the dependence of the periods of rr0 at a given temperature on metallicity ( the so - called `` period - shift '' ; sandage , katem & sandage 1981 , sandage 1981 , 1982a , 1982b , 1990 ) .",
    "they concluded that while the progression of the average rr0 period is continuous with metallicity , the gap is caused by the non - monotonic behavior of the hb morphology with metallicity .",
    "the subsequent studies indicated as possible responsibles the hysteresis mechanism i.e. the metallicity dependence of the transition between the fundamental and the first - overtone pulsation mode ( van albada & baker 1973 ; stellingwerf 1975 ; caputo , tornambe & castellani 1978 ; bono et al .",
    "1995 ; bono , caputo & marconi 1995 ; castellani , caputo & castellani 2003 ) , the off - zero age hb ( zahb ) evolution occurring in ooii clusters rr0 ( lee , demarque & zinn 1990 ; lee 1991 ; clement & shelton 1999 ) and the age differences among the two main oosterhoff groups ( lee & carney 1999 ; gratton et al .",
    "another puzzling evidence came to light when the observations of rr0 variables in extra - galactic gcs and in nearby dwarf galaxies were available : while galactic gcs tend to avoid the oosterhoff gap , dwarf galaxies and their gcs populate preferentially the gap ( walker 1992 ; siegel & majewski 2000 ; cseresnjes 2001 ; dallora et al . 2003 ; soszynski et al . 2003 ; greco et al .",

    "2013 ; cusano et al .",
    "this finding has a deep relevance also in the context of the galaxy formation scenario since it represents a serious challenge to the identification of the dwarf galaxies as the building blocks of the milky way ( catelan 2009 ) .",
    "the clusters belonging to the ooiii group ( ngc6388 and ngc6441 ) deserve a special discussion : these clusters host a large number of rr lyrae at odds with other gcs with similar metallicity .",
    "they also show an extended hb morphology with a tilted shape ( rich et al .",
    "all these peculiarities can be explained by assuming an enhanced helium abundance for the rr lyrae in these clusters ( sweigart & catelan 1998 ; moehler & sweigart 2006 ; busso et al .",
    "2007 ; caloi & dantona 2007 ; yoon et al . 2008 ; moretti et al .",
    "2009 ) possibly linked to a self - enrichment process occurred in these gcs .",
    "in this context , the overall picture has been furthermore complicated by the discovery that gcs host multiple stellar populations with different ages and p - capture elements abundances ( carretta et al .",
    "2009b ; piotto 2009 ) .",
    "the superposition of multiple populations with differences in their chemistry ( in particular he and c+n+o abundances ) can affect the morphology of the hb ( carretta et al .",

    "2013 , 2014 ; milone et al .",
    "2014 ) as well as the properties of their rr lyrae variables ( jang et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "while the main processes producing the oosterhoff dichotomy have been recognized , their relative efficiencies have still not been quantified in a large sample of gcs .    in this paper",
    "we compare the observed color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of a sample of 13 gcs belonging to the milky way and to 4 gcs belonging to two nearby satellite galaxies ( 1 in the large magellanic cloud and 3 in the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy ) with synthetic cmds with the aim of reproducing the pulsational properties of their rr0 variables .",
    "previous analyses of this kind have been already performed in individual gcs by several groups ( marconi et al .",

    "[ per_eq ] lead to an increase of periods with age .",
    "the strongest contribution to the mean period variation is that of the increase of rr0 luminosity in old clusters .",
    "in fact , in older clusters stars reach the hb phase with a smaller mass populating the blue portion of the hb at high temperatures . at relatively young ages",
    "hb stars cover a temperature range which include the entire instability strip . in this case , most of the stars become rr0 when their luminosity is close to that of the zahb in a region of the cmd where they spend the largest fraction of their hb evolution .",
    "when the cluster age exceeds a critical value ( @xmath46 at [ fe / h]=-1.65 ) the largest fraction of hb stars start their evolution in the blue part of the hb and cross the instability strip during their off - zahb evolution at high luminosity ( see the top panels of fig .",
    "[ ageeff ] ) .",
    "a less important contribution is due to the smaller masses of rr0 in older clusters .",
    "it is interesting to note the non - monotonic contribution of the temperature variation of rr0 variables to the mean period : at ages younger than @xmath4711 gyr an increase in the cluster age has the effect of increasing the mean temperature of rr0 ( with a consequent decreasing effect on the period ) as a direct consequence of the smaller hb mass .",
    "however , at older ages the mean temperature of rr0 decreases contributing to the increase of their mean periods .",
    "this is a consequence of the hysteresis process : when the temperature of the star on the zahb is smaller than the fobe ( in young / metal - rich clusters ) it can become rr0 during its entire evolution at temperature hotter than the fre , even when it crosses the or region . on the other hand , if the hb evolution starts at temperature hotter than the fbe ( in old / metal - poor clusters ) the star crosses the or region from its blue border pulsating as a rr1 . in this last case",
    ", it becomes an rr0 only after the crossing of the fore at low temperature .",

    "it is evident that the largest impact of hysteresis on the mean rr0 period is due to its effect on the rr0 temperatures",
    ".    another interesting result of the analysis presented here is that all the ooi and ooii clusters follow the same mass loss - metallicity relation , with the most metal - poor clusters loosing a smaller fraction of mass .",
    "this evidence has been already found by gratton et al .",
    "( 2010 ) who considered a large sample of gcs spanning a wide range of metallicity . if we link the amount of mass loss to the cluster metallicity , and assume the same he , [ @xmath16/fe ] and cno content , the morphology of the hb and the mean rr0 periods turn out to depend only on the cluster metallicity and age . in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "he abundance ( y=0.26 ) , our simulation fail to reproduce the mean rr0 period ( with a predicted @xmath51 , significantly shorter than the observed value of @xmath52 ) .",
    "moreover , to fit the anomalous morphology of the hb of this cluster we need to assume a large amount of mass loss ( @xmath53 ) which stray from the mass loss - metallicity relation defined by the other clusters .",
    "many authors proposed a significantly larger he abundance for ooiii clusters to account for the extended morphology of their hbs ( sweigart & catelan 1998 ; busso et al .",
    "2007 ; yoon et al . 2008 ) .",
    "an enhanced he abundance has the effect of increasing the efficiency of the cno cycle in the hydrogen - burning shell thus increasing the hb luminosity .",
    "another effect is to accelerate the stellar evolution so that he enhanced stars reach the hb phase with a smaller mass with respect to he - normal stars of the same age .",
    "however , the least massive stars are expected to populate the blue portion of the hb at temperatures warmer than the instability strip . as a consequence ,",
    "the net effect of a he enhancement is the increase of periods ( marconi et al .",
    "we then performed a set of simulation at different he abundances by interpolating across the grid of he - enhanced tracks by basti database .",
    "the best - fit to the observed mean rr0 period is obtained by adopting a he abundance of y=0.35 .",
    "this value is in agreement with the amount needed to explain the extension and the slope of the hb of this cluster ( busso et al .",
    "another effect of this assumption is the derived age : in case of a significant he enhancement , this cluster turns out to be significantly younger than the other milky way gcs ( @xmath547 gyr ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that in he - rich stellar populations the magnitude difference between the turn - off and the hb increases because of the increased luminosity of the hb .",
    "such a combination of he enhancement and young age is however inconsistent with the observed magnitude difference of the rgb bump and the hb level ( raimondo et al . 2002 ) .",
    "a possible solution to this problem has been provided by caloi & dantona ( 2007 ) in an analogous analysis in the other ooiii cluster ngc6441 : they assumed the superposition of three stellar populations with different he abundances , as already proposed for many gcs ( piotto 2009 ; carretta et al .",
    "2009b ) and observed in ngc6388 ( moretti et al .",
    "2009 ; bellini et al .",
    "2013 ) . indeed ,",
    "if the dominant cluster population of this cluster would be he - poor it should have a red hb population which is not expected to produce a sizeable population of rr lyrae , while the positions of its rgb bump and turn - off would be compatible with that of an old gc . on the other hand a fraction of he enhanced stars populate the region bracketing the instability strip , thus producing the observed long mean rr0 period .",
    "-[fe / h ] relations for clusters with @xmath20=10 gyr ( solid line ) and @xmath20=13 gyr ( dashed line ) are shown for a set of simulations performed assuming the gratton et al .",

    "the region where ooint clusters are expected to be located is shown by the grey shaded area.,width=328 ]",
    "we included in our analysis a sample of 4 old extra - galactic gcs : one belonging to the lmc ( ngc1466 ) and 3 belonging to the fornax dsph ( f2 , f3 and f4 ) .",
    "these clusters have a metallicity comparable with that of the metal - poor ooii clusters of the milky way but show mean rr0 periods comprised within the oosterhoff gap .",
    "the results of our simulations , conducted assuming a low @xmath15=0.0 $ ] , are shown in fig .",
    "it is noticeable that our simulations overestimate the mean rr0 periods for 3 out 4 clusters ( with the only exception of f4 ) . in particular , a systematic offset of @xmath55 is noticeable for these 3 clusters .",
    "also the relative fraction of rr1 are significantly overestimated .",
    "such differences , could be produced by many uncertain assumptions we made .",
    "first , while the [ @xmath16/fe ] in these galaxies has been proved to be smaller than what observed in the milky way at the same metallicity ( venn et al .",
    "2004 ) , direct measurements of the [ @xmath16/fe ] abundance in two fornax gcs of our sample ( f2 and f3 ; letarte et al .",
    "2006 ) showed an @xmath16-enhancement comparable with that observed among galactic gcs . by repeating the simulations with the same @xmath16-enhanced mixture adopted for the milky way gcs ,",
    "the difference between the predicted and observed mean rr0 periods reduces to @xmath56 , which is comparable with the shift observed for the milky way ooii gcs .",
    "second , at least for fornax gcs , mackey & gilmore ( 2003 ) reported that because of their short observational baseline both their mean rr0 periods and the relative fraction of rr1 could be underestimated .",
    "moreover , it is worth noting that spectroscopic metallicities are not available for some of these clusters and in some case the adopted [ fe / h ] comes from photometric indices .",
    "however , in spite of these caution notes , the observed discrepancy in the mean rr0 periods is associated to an anomalously small amount of mass loss which stray from the relation defined by the milky way gcs .",
    "a small amount of mass loss has been also reported by salaris et al .",
    "( 2013 ) to reproduce the hb morphology of the sculptor dsph .",
    "note that in the present analysis the amount of mass loss is the only free parameter which determines the hb morphology , so the difference in the amount of mass loss simply reflects the differences in the hb morphology in these gcs .    in practice , as already noted by other authors ( see e.g. buonanno et al .",
    "1998 ) , extra - galactic gcs tends to show hb morphologies which are redder than those of galactic gcs with the same metallicity . although the details of the mass loss process occurring during the cluster lifetime are still uncertain , it is difficult to find a physical reason why this stellar evolution process should depend on the host galaxy environment .",
    "it is therefore likely that the variation of other hidden parameters could produce the observed differences .    in analogy with what derived for ooiii cluster , a different he abundance",
    "can significantly influence both the hb morphology and the mean rr0 periods . in this case , a depletion of he of @xmath57 is needed to reproduce the observed mean rr0 periods and hb morphology implying an amount of mass loss comparable to that of milky way gcs .",
    "however , our simulations have been already performed assuming the cosmological he abundance ( y=0.245 ; cyburt , fields & olive 2003 ; salaris et al . 2004 ) so that an unlikely sub - cosmological he abundance would be required for the extra - galactic gcs to explain the observed differences , unless some deceptive systematic uncertainties in the adopted theoretical framework are present .",
    "another parameter affecting the hb evolution is the abundance of the cno elements .",
    "it has been indeed shown that an enhanced cno abundance produces an increase in luminosity and a decrease in the effective temperature of hb tracks ( dorman 1992 ) .",
    "we then performed a set of simulation assuming an @xmath16-enhanced , cno - enhanced mixture ( [ @xmath16/fe]=+0.4 ; [ cno / fe]=+0.3 ) by interpolating across the grid of tracks by pietrinferni et al . ( 2009 ) . by adopting this chemical composition , the mean rr0 periods further decrease leading to a residual difference @xmath58 with respect to observations . in this case the amount of mass loss increase at values @xmath59 , similar to those adopted for milky way gcs of the same metallicity .",
    "in this paper we used cmd synthesis joined with the results of non - linear pulsation models to simultaneously reproduce both the cmd morphology and the pulsational properties of rr0 variables for a sample of galactic gcs which determine the oosterhoff dichotomy and for a sample of extra - galactic gcs .",
    "we find that the oosterhoff dichotomy among milky way gcs is naturally reproduced by models with metal - poor ooii gcs ( @xmath4<-1.65 $ ] ) having mean rr0 periods longer by @xmath60 with respect to ooi ones .",
    "a careful analysis of the relative impact of the main physical processes affecting the mean rr0 periods in the analysed gcs indicates that the observed difference is due to the combination of two effects : _",
    "i ) _ the systematic age difference between metal - poor and metal - rich gcs in the metallicity range @xmath0<-1.4 $ ] ( as already proposed by lee & carney 1999 ) , and _",
    "ii ) _ the hysteresis mechanism ( van albada & baker 1973 ) .",
    "the former process relies on the effect of the cluster age on the hb morphology which favors a large fraction of evolved rr0 variables in those ( old and/or metal - poor ) gcs with a blue hb morphology ( see lee et al .",
    "the latter process leads to a shift toward cold temperature ( i.e. large periods ) of the effective border of the rr0/rr1 transition in ooii clusters .    the analysed gcs belonging to the main oosterhoff groups obey to the same mass loss - metallicity relation , as already found by gratton et al .",
    "( 2010 ) while ooint and ooiii clusters stray from such a relation . in this picture , and assuming a constant he , [ @xmath16/fe ] and cno abundance , the mean rr0 periods of gcs depend univocally on their ages and metallicities .",
    "it is interesting to note that , as a consequence of the above conclusions , the oosterhoff dichotomy can be viewed as a natural consequence of the lack of old ( @xmath61 gyr ) gcs in the metallicity range ( @xmath49<-1.3 $ ] ) , and the concomitant absence of young ( @xmath62 gyr ) gcs at @xmath4<-1.6 $ ] .",
    "it is not clear whether these gaps in the age - metallicity relation of galactic gcs are due to stochastic effects or to a physical process linked to the mechanism of formation and chemical evolution of the galactic halo . in this regard",
    ", we note that these gaps are located close to the separation between the two branches of the gcs age - metallicity relation .",
    "leaman , vandenberg & mendel ( 2013 ) proposed that gcs belonging to the _ young branch _ of the age - metallicity relation could form in satellite galaxies later accreted by the milky way during the early building - up process of the galactic halo while those belonging to the _ old branch _ formed in - situ .    at odds with",
    "what happens in galactic gcs , the analysed gcs belonging to the nearby dsph ( lmc and fornax ) exhibit shorter mean rr0 periods and redder hb morphology with respect to milky way gcs of the same metallicity .",
    "this effect is compatible with the correlation between the integrated ultraviolet colors of gcs and the mass of their host galaxy found by dalessandro et al .",
    "an investigation on the effect of the various input parameters indicates as a possible solution a depleted he abundance or an increased [ cno / fe ] ratio in these clusters .",
    "the presence of such chemical differences between milky way and dsph gcs could be linked to their different chemical evolution . in principle",
    ", the @xmath63 gradient is not expected to significantly change in galaxies of different sizes ( balser 2006 ) .",
    "however , differences in the mean he content could be linked to the different gcs formation process in these galaxies .",
    "indeed , the proposed scenario for the origin of the multiple stellar populations in gcs predicts that a first generation of stars polluted the intra - cluster medium where a more concentrated second generation formed . the first generation then evaporates because of the interaction of the cluster with the host galaxy ( dercole et al .",
    "the present - day fraction of first / second generation should therefore reflect the strength of the tidal field which is expected to be smaller in dsph than in the milky way ( dantona et al .",
    "it has been shown that the chemical signatures of multiple population are present among the hb stars of many milky way gcs ( marino et al .",
    "2011 ; gratton et al .",
    "2011 , 2012a , 2013 , 2014 ) .",
    "it is not clear if the same chemical anomalies ( e.g. the na - o anticorrelation ) are present in extra - galactic gcs ( johnson , ivans & stetson 2006 ; mucciarelli et al .",
    "2009 ; mucciarelli , origlia & ferraro 2010 ; mateluna et al .",
    "if extra - galactic gcs would contain a smaller ( if any ) fraction of second generation he - enhanced stars with respect to galactic gcs , this would explain a difference in their average he content .",
    "this however should involve a problem in the zero point of the mean rr0 periods which appear to be consistent with a cosmological he abundance in galactic gcs .",
    "although the mean rr0 period is very sensitive to the uncertainties in the temperature of the fre ( mainly linked to the uncertainty on the convection theory ) and in the hb luminosity , this hypothesis requires a deeper investigation .",
    "a cno enhancement can produce a similar effect . in principle",
    "dsph , because of their shallow potential well , are expected to retain a small fraction of elements produced in sne explosions ( like fe ) with respect to those produced during the asymptotic giant branch nucleosynthesis ( like c , n and o ) .",
    "so , a larger [ cno / fe ] abundance pattern could be present in these clusters . unfortunately ,",
    "reliable measures of the c+n+o abundance are now available only for few galactic gcs , often providing conflicting results ( yong et al .",
    "2009 ; villanova , geisler & piotto 2010 ; gratton et al .",
    "2012b ) .    the comparison of the predicted and observed rr0 properties of ngc6388",
    ", the only ooiii cluster analysed here , suggests that the rr0 population of this cluster must be constituted by he - enhanced ( @xmath64 ) stars .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with what already proposed for ooiii clusters by many authors on the basis of its hb morphology ( sweigart & catelan 1998 ; moehler & sweigart 2006 ; yoon et al .",
    "however , considerations on the magnitude difference between the hb , the rgb bump and the turn - off of this cluster imply that the dominant cluster population must have a canonical he abundance and does not contribute to the rr lyrae population of this cluster .",
    "this is consistent with the evidence of multiple stellar populations observed in this gc ( moretti et al .",

    "<S> we use color - magnitude diagram synthesis together with theoretical relations from non - linear pulsation models to approach the long - standing problem of the oosterhoff dichotomy related to the distribution of the mean periods of fundamental rr lyrae variables in globular clusters . by adopting the chemical composition determined from spectroscopic observations and a criterion to account for the hysteresis mechanism , we tuned age and mass - loss to simultaneously reproduce the morphology of both the turn - off and the horizontal branch of a sample of 17 globular clusters of the milky way and of nearby dwarf galaxies in the crucial metallicity range ( @xmath0<-1.4 $ ] ) where the oostheroff transition is apparent . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the oosterhoff dichotomy among galactic globular clusters is naturally reproduced by models . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the relative impact of the various involved parameters indicates that the main responsibles of the dichotomy are the peculiar distribution of clusters in the age - metallicity plane and the hysteresis . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , there is a clear connection between the two main branches of the age - metallicity relation for galactic globular clusters and the oosterhoff groups . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of clusters rr lyrae belonging to other oostheroff groups ( ooint and ooiii ) are instead not well reproduced . while for ooiii clusters a larger helium abundance for a fraction of the cluster s stars can reconcile the model prediction with observations , some other parameter affecting both the horizontal branch morphology and the rr lyrae periods is required to reproduce the behavior of ooint clusters .    </S>",
