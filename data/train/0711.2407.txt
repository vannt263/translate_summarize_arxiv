    "the effect of the in - plane magnetic field on electron states in qws is not so pronounced as that of the perpendicular field because , due to the strong quantum confinement , the in - plane field does not form the landau levels .",
    "however , it has been established that the in - plane magnetic field leads not only to spin splitting of electron states ( the zeeman effect ) but also affects the orbital motion of free carriers .",

[ ] ) and direct optical transitions ,  @xcite and can also modify the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "@xcite    here we address the effect of an external magnetic field applied in the interface plane on the electron scattering in quantum wells .",
    "we show that the magnetic field leads to an in - plane asymmetry of the electron scattering by static defects or phonons , so that the scattering probability contains additional terms which are proportional to both the electron wave vector and the magnetic field components . taking into account this contribution one can write for the scattering rate @xmath1 where @xmath0 and @xmath2 are the initial and scattered wave vectors , respectively , and @xmath3 is the magnetic field .",
    "the scattering rate at zero field @xmath4 and the pseudo - tensor components @xmath5 are determined by the details of scattering processes and , owing to the time inversion symmetry , are even functions of the electron wave vector .",
    "note , that in fact the asymmetric part of the scattering rate can contain all terms odd in the wave vector including cubic terms .",
    "although the scattering asymmetry does not modify the energy spectrum , it can affect kinetics of the carriers .",
    "phenomenologically , asymmetric terms in the scattering rate given by eq .",
    "( [ w_kk ] ) are caused by the lack of a spatial inversion center in quantum wells due to structure and/or bulk inversion asymmetry .",
    "this follows from the symmetry analysis which does not require knowledge of microscopical mechanisms of the scattering .",

    "to be specific , we consider below ( 001)-oriented qws grown from zinc - blende - type compounds . in such structures ,",
    "the pseudo - tensor @xmath5 contains two linearly independent components and the scattering rate  ( [ w_kk ] ) assumes the form @xmath12 \\\\ & + & w_{\\mathrm{bia } } [ b_x ( k_x+k_x ' ) - b_y ( k_y+k_y ' ) ] \\nonumber \\:,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 are caused by structure and bulk inversion asymmetry , respectively , @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] are the in - plane coordinates , and @xmath17 $ ] is the qw normal .",
    "microscopically , the scattering asymmetry originates from the lorentz force which acts on moving charge carriers and modifies their wave functions . the effect is most easily conceivable for the terms in the scattering rate caused by structure inversion asymmetry , i.e. , terms proportional to @xmath18 in eq .",

    "this case is illustrated in fig .  1 for the electron scattering by impurities .",

    "this leads to modification of the function of size quantization of electrons along the qw normal @xmath28 which becomes @xmath27-dependent , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "since the @xmath19-layer of impurities is shifted from the qw center to the lower interface , the wave function of electrons with the positive velocity @xmath27 is better overlapped with the impurity potentials than the function of electrons with the negative @xmath27 . as a result",
    ", the electrons with @xmath29 are scattered by impurities at higher rate than the carriers with @xmath30 leading to the in - plane asymmetry of the scattering . since the lorentz force is proportional to both the magnetic field and the electron velocity ,",
    "the small corrections to the scattering rate are linear in @xmath0 and linear in @xmath3 . in the above model",
    ", we assumed that the structure inversion asymmetry and , consequently , @xmath0-linear terms in the scattering rate are caused by asymmetry of the doping profile with respect to the qw center .",
