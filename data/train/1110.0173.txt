    "<S> we present a solution for the geodesic motion in gdel s universe that provides a particular proof of hawking s chronology protection conjecture in three - dimensional gravity theory . </S>",
    "<S> the solution is based upon the fact that the seven - dimensional group of the automorphisms of the heisenberg motion group @xmath0 , modulo discrete sub - group @xmath1 , act isometrically on the boundary of the hyperbolic three - dimensional manifold.closed timelike curves do not exist due to the presence of a closed cauchy - riemann surface for chronology protection , with two mirror symmetric sets of helicoidal self - similar modules inside.the present solution is isometrically equivalent to a cylindrical gravitational monochromatic wave front .    in 1949 , gdel @xcite discovered a new solution for einstein s field equations in which causality is violated by the existence of periodic world lines that run back into themselves . </S>",
    "<S> the periods are given by integrals over the proper time differential @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these cycles are known as closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) . according to tipler @xcite a massive infinite rotating cylinder </S>",
    "<S> should create a frame dragging effect in the space - time giving rise to ctcs . </S>",
    "<S> tipler suggested , without proof , that in a finite rotating cylinder ctcs would arise allowing travel into the past .    the non existence of ctcs in acceptable spacetimes , </S>",
    "<S> was demonstrated by deser , jackiw and t hooft @xcite in 1992 . in the same year , hawking @xcite showed that , according to the general theory of relativity , it is impossible to build a time machine in finite regions of the spacetime without curvature singularities , due to the presence of negative energy states.hawking posited the existence of a cauchy - riemann spacelike surface with a compact horizon for chronology protection , so that causality violation could never be observed from the outside . </S>",
    "<S> this conjecture is known as the chronology protection conjecture . for </S>",
    "<S> the chronology protection conjecture see also @xcite    nowadays it is believed that some fundamental properties of supermassive black holes may be understood in the realm of a @xmath3-dimensional gdel universe . in particular , the static gimon - hashimoto solution for the @xmath4 case @xcite , has attracted considerable attention associated with @xmath5-theory , pp waves , thermodynamics of black holes and strong gravitational lensing effects and has been the focus of recent research @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the geodesic motion in gdel s universe is not yet completely understood even though great strides have been made over the past @xmath6 years @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this letter is to provide , the appropriate geometrical setting to prove hawking s chronology protection conjecture in gdel s universe . for our purpose </S>",
    "<S> it is sufficient to analyze the @xmath7-dimensional gdel universe in a finite rotating cylinder with constant angular velocity @xmath8 , and negative cosmological constant @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> first of all , we show that gdel s spacetime is invariant under local actions of the @xmath10-dimensional group of automorphisms of the reduced heisenberg motion group @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the geodesic problem is reduced to a sub - riemannian variational problem in the cotangent space , @xmath12 , of the @xmath13-dimensional heisenberg group , a well known problem in the realm of mathematical control theory @xcite .    _ the heisenberg group _ - the heisenberg group plays the fundamental role in diverse topics such as harmonic analysis @xcite , classical and quantum mechanics @xcite , and sub - riemannian geometry ( also known as carnot - charathodory geometry ) @xcite . as it is the most simple non - abelian nilpotent lie group homeomorphic to the euclidean space it offers the opportunity for generalizing the remarkable results of non - commutative harmonic analysis to soluble models of non - abelian gauge field theories . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it offers a interesting soluble scenario for gribov s theory of quark confinement@xcite    in 2000,the heisenberg group was used to prove the possible existence of bound pairs of self - dual non - abelian magnetic monopoles in high energy physics @xcite . </S>",
