    "the structure of neutron - rich nuclei in the @xmath7-shell region has attracted significant interest recently @xcite . the emergence of the @xmath8 = 16 shell and the simultaneous disappearance of the @xmath8 = 20 shell sparked the interest especially in the oxygen and fluorine isotopes @xcite .",
    "interaction- , reaction- , and charge - changing cross section @xcite as well as fragmentation cross sections @xcite have been measured and analyzed . however , a more detailed knowledge of properties of nuclei in this region is essential to understand the nuclear structure along the dripline .    in view of the emergence of the @xmath8 = 16 shell",
    "it has been suggested that the normal level structure is already influenced in @xmath6o @xcite .",
    "one would expect that the ground state of @xmath6o is an @xmath9 level with strong single particle character .",
    "however , in order to explain the measured momentum distribution it was necessary to modify the core ( @xmath10o ) structure @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is controversial because an analysis of the data based on the many - body shell model and eikonal theory did not confirm the need for any changes of the level structure in @xmath6o @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that one - nucleon knock - out reactions are a useful tool to extract spectroscopic factors @xcite .",
    "the single proton stripping reactions ( @xmath0f,@xmath6o ) and ( @xmath1f,@xmath0o ) should be a sensitive tool to study the ground state properties of @xmath6o and @xmath0o .",
    "although experimentally not confirmed the ground state of @xmath0f is most likely a @xmath11 state composed of @xmath12 coupled to a @xmath13 @xcite and the ground - state of @xmath1f is supposed to be the @xmath12 state .",
    "thus the reactions ( @xmath0f,@xmath6o ) and ( @xmath1f,@xmath0o ) should have strong couplings to the ground state of @xmath6o and @xmath0o , respectively .",
    "we have measured single - proton knock - out cross section of @xmath0f , @xmath1f , and @xmath2f to populate states of @xmath10o , @xmath6o , and @xmath0o . in most cases it its necessary to measure the reaction in coincidence with @xmath14-rays to cleanly identify the populated state @xcite .",
    "however , the search for excited states in the last bound oxygen isotopes @xmath6o and @xmath0o have been negative @xcite so @xmath14-ray coincidence measurements are not necessary in the present cases to identify the final state .",
    "the knock - out reaction of the heaviest fluorine isotope feasible up - to - date ( @xmath2f,@xmath1o ) leads to the particle - unstable nucleus @xmath1o @xcite .",
    "the experiments were performed at the coupled cyclotron facility of the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory at michigan state university @xcite . a 110 mev",
    "/ nucleon @xmath15ca@xmath16 beam was fragmented on a beryllium target .",
    "the a1900 fragment separator contained an acrylic wedge degrader at the intermediate image .",
    "the momentum acceptance of the a1900 was limited to 1% .",
    "details of the production of the secondary beams of @xmath0f , @xmath1f and @xmath2f are listed in table [ t : a1900 ] .    [ cols= \"",
    "> , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ t : sp ]    the strong population of the @xmath6o ground state in the ( @xmath0f,@xmath6o ) reaction yields additional evidence that the usual shell - model calculations give a good description of nuclei in this region @xcite . in fact ,",
    "even the simplest picture , that of the ground state of @xmath6o described as a @xmath17 \\otimes 1s_{1/2}$ ] configuration , gives a near - quantitative description , both of the present data and of the @xmath6o neutron knock - out reactions @xcite .",
    "the spin of @xmath0f , although most likely 3@xmath18 , is not essential for the argument , given that the proton in any case will be in the @xmath19 state .",
    "f ( a ) , @xmath1f ( b ) , and @xmath2f . the calculated excitation energy distribution of the spectroscopic factors ( @xmath20/500kev ) for @xmath21 ( shaded bars ) and @xmath22-shell protons are indicated on the left .",
    "the cross sections in the figure are calculated as the product of the spectroscopic factors and the single - particle cross sections of figure [ f : excitation ] . ]    for the population of the ground state of @xmath1o in the proton knock - out from @xmath2f only an upper limit can be extracted because @xmath1o is unbound and decays to @xmath0o .",
    "the ground state of @xmath0o can also be populated from the decay of excited states in @xmath1o .",
    "thus , the measured cross section of 4.1@xmath23 mb correspond to a sum of the contributions from the decay of the ground - state and excited states of @xmath1o ( see also figure [ f : schemes](c ) and the following section ) .      -shell have been calculated for three excitation energies in @xmath0f ( triangles ) , @xmath1f ( circles ) , and @xmath2f ( squares ) .",
    "the solid line shows a fit that was used to calculates the toal @xmath22-wave removal cross section . ]    the cross section for the population of other oxygen isotopes in these breakup reactions can only be estimated because several production mechanisms can contribute .",
    "in addition to the single - proton knock - out followed by subsequent neutron emission , direct population of the ground state as well as bound excited states have to be taken into account .    within the eikonal approach",
    "one can calculate the single - particle distribution due to contributions from the knock - out of protons from the @xmath22-shell .",
    "the spectroscopic strength distribution as calculated within the shell model using the universal @xmath24 ( usd ) interaction @xcite is shown on the left side of figure [ f : schemes ] .",
    "the single - particle cross section calculated in the eikonal model depends on the effective proton separation energy which is the sum of the proton separation energy and the excitation energy of the specific state .",
    "the proton separation energies for @xmath0f , @xmath1f , and @xmath2f are 14.4 mev , 15.0 mev , and 16.1 mev , respectively , figure [ f : excitation ] shows that the proton - removal cross sections are very similar for the three fluorine isotopes . in order to extract the total proton - removal cross sections from the @xmath22-shell the spectroscopic distributions were folded with the excitation - energy dependent stripping cross section of figure [ f : excitation ] .",
    "the values for the @xmath22-shell proton - removal cross sections are 25.7 mb , 25.2 mb and 25.0 mb for @xmath0f , @xmath1f , and @xmath2f , respectively , and are listed ( p,@xmath25 ) in figure [ f : schemes ] .",
    "these populations are located above the one- , two- , three- , and even the four - neutron evaporation channel .",
    "the decay branches to the individual neutron channels depend on the details of the excited states in these nuclei . as mentioned above other processes also contribute to the population of these channels , so that calculating these decay branches is not useful .",
    "the only quantitative statement that can be extracted from the present data is that the calculated @xmath22-shell proton - removal cross section should not exceed the summed cross section of the open neutron channels .    for the reaction ( @xmath0f,@xmath6o ) the 1-n to 3-n channels have to be taken into account .",
    "the threshold for the 4-n channel ( @xmath26o ) at 21 mev is located above the population for the removal of protons from the @xmath22-shell .",
    "the sum of the cross sections for these three neutron decay channels ( population of @xmath27o ) as listed in table [ t : cross ] is 39.7@xmath53.0  mb , which has to be compared to a total proton - removal cross section from the @xmath22-shell of 25.7  mb .",
    "these cross sections are also indicated in figure [ f : schemes ] .",
    "the sum of the population of the 1-n to 3-n channel ( @xmath28o ) in the reaction ( @xmath1f,@xmath0o ) is 32.4@xmath52.2 mb .",
    "this value is only slightly larger than the calculated proton - removal cross section of 25.2 mb .",
    "however , the threshold for the 4-n channel ( @xmath29o ) is located at 17.1 mev , which is below the highest energies of the distribution of @xmath22-shell proton removal so that it also could contribute .",
    "the reaction ( @xmath2f,@xmath1o ) has to be treated differently because @xmath1o is unstable and thus the contribution from @xmath22-shell removal can not be distinguished from the removal of the @xmath21 proton . the total calculated single proton - removal cross section from @xmath30- and",
    "@xmath22-wave knock - out is 32.6 mb .",
    "the open channels as indicated in figure [ f : schemes ] are the 1-n through 4-n decay , which corresponds to a cross section of 38.5@xmath55.0 mb",
    ". it might be even possible that the 5-n channel ( @xmath29o ) with a separation energy of 17 mev can contribute .",
    "for all three reactions studied , the predicted @xmath22-shell removal cross sections are consistent with the measured populations of the open neutron decay channels .",
    "it is interesting to note that the widely used empirical fragmentation model epax @xcite yields cross sections of the order of 10@xmath3120 mb for the population of these oxygen isotopes in agreement with the values listed in table [ t : cross ] .",
    "the recent measurements of fragmentation of unstable neutron - rich oxygen isotopes also included single proton knock - out cross sections @xcite .",
    "these measurements were performed at significantly higher energies ( @xmath32500 mev / nucleon ) and yielded cross sections of @xmath3320 mb .",
    "these measurements were not performed as close to the dripline as the current experiment and the populated nitrogen isotopes all had bound excited states , so a direct comparison to the present analysis is not possible . only the reaction of the most neutron - rich projectile @xmath34o populates a nucleus with no known bound excited states ( @xmath29n ) .",
    "unfortunately no cross section is quoted for this reaction @xcite .",
    "the results of the single - proton knock - out reactions were analyzed within the a theoretical approach combining many - body shell model and eikonal theory .",
    "the cross section for the reaction ( @xmath0f,@xmath6o ) is consistent with a single particle description of these nuclei , while the cross sections for the reaction ( @xmath1f,@xmath0o ) shows a suppression of @xmath3350% .",
    "however , experiments with higher precision are necessary in order to infer a change of the structure .",
    "the knock - out reactions on @xmath0f and @xmath1f are special because of the non - existence of bound excited states in @xmath6o and @xmath0o , respectively .",
    "the present method promises to be a powerful tool to extract spectroscopic information for nuclei at the very edge of the driplines because they typically do not have any bound excited states .",
    "other nuclei will require more sophisticated experimental arrangements , including @xmath14-ray coincidences .",
