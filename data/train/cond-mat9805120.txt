    "it has recently been proposed@xcite that the antiferromagnetic ( af ) and superconducting ( sc ) phases of the high-@xmath2 cuprates are unified by an @xmath0 symmetry principle .",
    "a remarkable degree of continuity between insulating and doped phase is indeed supported by a considerable body of numerical evidence@xcite .",
    "further support for this proposal came from numerical investigations , which demonstrated that the low - energy excitations of physical models for the high-@xmath2 materials , i.e. @xmath3 and hubbard models , can be classified in terms of an @xmath4symmetry multiplet structure@xcite . in these two - dimensional ( @xmath5 ) microscopic models ,",
    "the undoped situation - in agreement with the experimental situation in the cuprates - corresponds to that of a mott insulator with broken @xmath1 or spin rotational symmetry : long - range af order is realized .",
    "the @xmath4symmetry principle then tells us how this long - range magnetic order and the accompanying low - energy spin excitations are mapped onto the corresponding off - diagonal long - range sc order and the low - energy  goldstone bosons \" ( the @xmath6mode ) in the doped situation@xcite .",
    "+ however , there exists also a second class of mott - type insulators without long - range af order , i.e. spin liquids , which have a gap to spin excitations .",
    "there is growing experimental evidence that they are also intimately related to the physics of high-@xmath2 compounds : not only do these compounds show above the nel temperature and superconducting transition temperature at small dopings signs of such a spin gap , but there exist also copper - oxides with a @xmath7 plane containing line - defects , which result in ladder - like arrangements of @xmath8atoms@xcite . these systems can be described in terms of coupled two - leg ladders@xcite , which exhibit a spin gap in the insulating compound and thus belong to the spin - liquid mott - insulator variety . also the related  stripe phases \" of the @xmath5 @xmath7 planes in the cuprate superconductors",
    "have recently received considerable attention@xcite . in these systems , the apparent connection between the spin gap and superconductivity must be explained .",
    "+ in order to illustrate how the @xmath0 theory can , in principle , cope with this challenge , an exactly @xmath0 invariant ladder model has recently been constructed@xcite .",
    "it was shown that a 2-leg ladder with entirely local interactions , i.e. an on - site interaction @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the chain hopping , an intra - rung interaction @xmath11 and a magnetic rung - exchange interaction @xmath12 can have @xmath0 symmetry if these interactions are related to each other in a specific way , i.e. @xmath13 . the ground - state phase diagram of this model was determined in strong coupling and , in particular , a regime identified , where the strong - coupling ground state is a spin - gap insulator .",
    "in addition , the spin - gap magnon mode of the mott insulator was shown to evolve continuously into the @xmath6resonance mode of the superconductor .",
    "+ however , two key questions remained open , the first being the relationship of this @xmath0 ladder to the  physical \" @xmath3 or hubbard ladders and the second regarding the connection to the other variety of mott insulators , i.e. the ones with long - range af order . + with regard to the first question , progress was recently made in the regime of weak - coupling : using the weak - coupling renormalization group method , two independent works@xcite have recently demonstrated that rather generic ladder models at half - filling flows to an @xmath0 symmetric fixed point .",
    "+ in the present work , we try to attack both questions in the experimentally relevant intermediate and strong - coupling regimes .",
    "the basic idea is to derive the @xmath0 concept for a ladder or , more generally , for a spin liquid with an ",
    "rvb vacuum \" instead of an  nel vacuum \" involving a physically appealing new construction : an effective @xmath0 invariant low - energy hamiltonian is constructed in terms of a bond operator representation . in strong coupling , this is a well - established concept for spin ladders@xcite to account quantitatively for the spin excitations of heisenberg ladders ( up to the physically most relevant case of isotropic couplings in the rungs and along the ladder ) .",
    "the spin excitations are described in terms of triplet fluctuations around the rvb vacuum .",
    "the new idea is to combine this @xmath14symmetric description of the spin degrees of freedom , i.e. the triplet excitations , with the charge ( hole ) dynamics .",
    "this is accomplished by introducing two new bosons on a rung which stand for charge fluctuations , i.e. empty and fourfold occupied rungs . when combined into a 5-dimensional boson - vector , the dynamics of spin and charge excitations",
    "is captured by a manifestly @xmath0 invariant hamiltonian .",
    "+ it is shown that this formulation in terms of triplet and hole fluctuations around an  rvb vacuum \" allows for a physically transparent demonstration of the corner stone in @xmath0 theory , i.e. that af and sc are  two faces of one and the same coin \" . by starting from this  rvb vacuum \" , which represents the spin liquid state at half - filling , we demonstrate that an af ordered state can be generated by forming a coherent state @xmath15 which corresponds to @xmath16like triplets condensed into the @xmath17 state .",
    "however , in the @xmath0 theory , the @xmath16like triplet with momentum @xmath18 and the hole pair with momentum @xmath19 are components of one and the same @xmath20 vector .",
    "they are rotated into each other by the @xmath0 generating operator @xmath18 .",
    "this implies that the above coherent state with condensed triplets can be @xmath4rotated into a corresponding coherent state with @xmath21 replaced by the ( hole- ) pair creation operator @xmath22 this state corresponds to hole pairs condensed into the @xmath23 state , i.e. a superconducting state . in other words : both the af and the sc state can be viewed as a kind of condensation out of the rvb state , or the spin liquid . if the so constructed af state is the actual ground state at half - filling , then this physically very appealing @xmath0 construction yields automatically the ground state in the doped situation , i.e. the sc state .",
    "+ this construction can also shed light on the second of the above questions , namely the interrelation between the spin gap mott - insulator and superconductivity .",
    "the construction presented here rests on the special geometry of the 2-leg ladder , which suggests a unique  rvb vacuum \" , from which the af coherent state can be obtained . in @xmath24 ,",
    "such a unique vacuum does , in general , not exist , unless one takes the growing experimental evidence for some form of spatial inhomogenities such as stripes@xcite into account .",
    "however , even for a translationally invariant state , up to an additional statistical average over all possible dimer ( singlet ) coverings of the plane , the analogue of the triplet - like excitation in the ladder can still be generated : here singlet - dimers are substituted by triplet - dimers and this excited dimer propagates through the @xmath25system .",
    "again , the @xmath0 @xmath26operator converts excited dimers with momentum @xmath27 into @xmath28symmetry hole pairs with momentum @xmath29 a description of spin excitations in @xmath5 in terms of boson - like excited dimers , as for the ladder considered here , may thus be a natural starting point for clarifying the role of the spin gap ( for which the ladder is a  toy model \" ) and thus the role of the spin - liquid mott - insulators for superconductivity , in general .",
    "this will be discussed in a forthcoming paper@xcite .",
    "+ the first question , i.e. the adiabatic connection between the @xmath0 symmetric model and  physical \" ladder models , such as the @xmath3 model , is answered numerically in the present work .",
    "this is achieved by a kind of",
    " landau mapping \" of the single - and two - particle excitations of the @xmath0 ladder model onto the corresponding excitations of the @xmath3 ladder .",
    "+ as mentioned above , the empty - fourfold rung fluctuation involves , in principle , a high energy ( of order @xmath30 ) . in the @xmath0 description ,",
    "the hamiltonian is supplemented by a term which contains density and exchange interactions , and which physically pulls down the empty - fourfold fluctuation to be degenerate with the triplet - triplet fluctuation .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this can be achieved already for purely local interactions @xmath31 and @xmath12 within the rungs by choosing @xmath32 .",
    "we demonstrate numerically that , and give physical reasons why , this at first sight rather unphysical parameter condition nevertheless gives in fact an astonishingly good mapping of the @xmath0 model onto the @xmath3 model for the low - energy @xmath33 versus momentum @xmath34 dynamics .",
    "these findings strongly support the physical relevance of the @xmath0 description in physical ladder models , such as hubbard and @xmath3 models , which are of the spin - liquid mott insulator variety .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii describes the construction of an @xmath0 symmetric ladder model in terms of bond - triplet and -charge bosons , which are unified into a common @xmath0 vector @xmath35 .",
    "it also contains the coherent - state description , where an af ordered state with staggered magnetization in @xmath16direction is generated by a condensation of @xmath16like triplet excitations . when the triplets are rotated ( via the @xmath36operator ) onto the corresponding hole pairs ( with @xmath37 symmetry ) , a @xmath38 state results .",
    "iii then contains a general representation of the @xmath0 multiplet structure in terms of irreducible representations in the @xmath39 plane ( here @xmath40@xmath41@xmath42 with @xmath43 the number of electrons and @xmath44 the sunmber of sites@xcite is the pair density and @xmath45 the @xmath46-component of total spin ) .",
    "we consider here the previously studied multiplets of diamond shape@xcite ( corresponding to even numbers of electrons or holes , i.e. electron or hole pairs ) as well as multiplets evolving to a square shape .",
    "the latter correspond to odd numbers of charge carriers and are thus required for building up selction rules for photoemission .",
    "iv verifies these selelction rules in exact diagonalizations of @xmath47 @xmath0 ladders .",
    "similarly , sec .",
    "v numerically illustrates the spin and charge dynamics of the exact @xmath0 model and checks corresponding selection rules for spin- and charge correlation functions .",
    "vi discusses the  landau mapping \" and adiabatic connection to the physical @xmath3 model , and sec .",
    "vii gives a short conclusion .",
    "we begin with the standard hubbard model on a 2-leg ladder , i.e. @xmath48 the nearest - neighbor hopping integral along the legs will be called @xmath10 , the one within the rungs @xmath49 , and @xmath50 denotes the on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "we assume the strong coupling limit , @xmath51 and start out with the case of half - filling and vanishing leg - hopping @xmath10 .",
    "the system then decomposes into an array of heitler - london type dimers and the gound state is simply the product of singlets along the rungs of the ladder , with energy @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the number of rungs .",
    "this state is frequently referred to as the ` rung rvb state ' and has been the basis of many theoretical works on spin ladders@xcite .",
    "next , let us consider the effect of switching on @xmath10 .",
    "this will produce charge fluctuations , and hence exchange processes along the legs . these lead , as a first step , to the ` pair creation ' of triplets along the legs . in subsequent steps",
    ", these newly created triplets can propagate along the ladder ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) . introducing operators which create singlets and triplets@xcite : @xmath54 we can write the rung - rvb state ( which we henceforth consider as a kind of ` vacuum ' ) , as @xmath55 here , the site indices along a rung , @xmath56 , have been replaced by a single index @xmath57 labelling the rung .",
    "it has been shown by gopalan _",
    "et al._@xcite that the dynamics of the triplets can be mapped _",
    "exactly _ onto a system of three species of hard - core bond - bosons on a 1d chain .",
    "thereby the presence of the boson @xmath58 on some site means that the corresponding rung is in the triplet @xmath59 state - absence of any boson implies that the rung is in the singlet state .",
    "the @xmath60 components of the triplet on the @xmath61 rung form a @xmath60-dimensional vector @xmath62 and the hamiltonian operator governing the triplet - like bosons can be cast into the following manifestly @xmath1 invariant form@xcite : @xmath63 here @xmath64 as usually denotes normal ordering and the parameters are @xmath12@xmath41@xmath65 and @xmath66@xmath41@xmath67 .",
    "the terms in ( [ triplets ] ) describe the ` energy of formation ' of a triplet ( 1st term ) ; the pair creation of two triplets on neighboring rungs ( 2nd term ) ; the propagation of a triplet ( 3rd term ) , the simultaneous ` species flop ' of two triplets on neighboring rungs ( 4th term ) ; and the exchange of two triplets ( 5th term)@xcite .",
    "+ let us now consider a new type of fluctuation . once a charge fluctuation has been created one might envisage that the remaining electron in the singly occupied rung follows suit , so that the resulting state has one empty rung , and a fourfold occupied rung ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "again ,    in subsequent steps the empty and fourfold occupied rung can propagate , in much the same way as the triplets did . clearly , the fourfold occupied rung has a very high energy @xmath68 .",
    "following ref.@xcite however , we now amend the hamiltonian with the goal to ` pull down ' this state in energy , so as to make the empty - fourfold state degenerate with the triplet - triplet state .",
    "this can be achieved by adding terms of the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the operator of electron density on site @xmath71 , and @xmath72 the operator of electron spin .",
    "it has been shown in ref.@xcite that by retaining only a density interaction @xmath31 and exchange constant @xmath12 within the rungs , and choosing @xmath73@xmath41@xmath74 , one can reach a situation where the empty - fourfold fluctuation in figure [ fig2]c is precisely degenerate with the triplet - triplet fluctuation in figure [ fig1]c , and both of them are lower than the singly - threefold intermediate state ( figure[fig1]b , figure[fig2]b ) . in the following , we call the energy of the singlet @xmath75 , that of the triplet / empty / fourfold occupied rung @xmath76 and that of a singly / threefold occupied rung @xmath77 .",
    "the situation we want to reach is @xmath78 .",
    "we would like to stress that the parameters we need to choose to reach this ( @xmath73@xmath41@xmath74 ) are rather unphysical .",
    "physically , if we want @xmath12 and @xmath50 to be positive and @xmath12 not to be too large , this requires a large negative rung interaction @xmath31 .",
    "however , for the time being we ignore this complication and defer a discussion of the case @xmath79 to the end of this section .",
    "+ if we restrict the hilbert space to only rung triplets and singlets , the hamiltonian ( [ triplets ] ) remains valid also for the @xmath0 symmetric ladder .",
    "the only difference is a change of @xmath12 to @xmath80 and a change of the boson s ` energy of formation ' from @xmath81 .",
    "our goal is now to simply retain this hamiltonian , but enlarge the 3-dimensional vector @xmath82 into a 5-dimensional vector comprising 2 additional bosons which represent the empty and fourfold occupied rung .",
    "we introduce new bosons @xmath83 and @xmath84 , whose presence on a rung implies that the rung is empty or fourfold occupied : @xmath85 ( the extra minus sign makes sure that the state corresponding to @xmath86 can be written as @xmath87 , with @xmath88 the singlet - pairing operator along a rung ) . just as two singlets on neighboring rungs can convert themselves in a kind of pair creation process ( figure[fig1]a @xmath89 figure[fig1]c ) into two triplets , they can also convert themselves into an empty rung and a fourfold occupied rung . and , similarly as a triplet can exchange itself with a singlet , so can an empty or doubly occupied rung .",
    "an analogous process to the 4th term would be the conversion of two triplets on neighboring rungs into an empty and a fourfold occupied rung . and",
    "finally , an empty rung can exchange itself also with a triplet , which corresponds to the 5th term . in eqn.(5 ) .",
    "+ the empty rungs and fourfold occupied rungs thus will act ` almost ' like the triplets - there is , however , a subtle and crucial difference .",
    "careful calculation shows that all matrix elements for pair creation and propagation of the empty and fourfold occupied rungs have the same magnitude , but _",
    "opposite sign _ as for the triplet rungs .",
    "the ultimate reason is that a spin - flip ( which propagates a triplet ) is accomplished by a back - and - forth motion of electrons , and hence picks up a fermi minus sign , whereas the propagation of an empty rung corresponds to a net movement of charge in one direction , and hence gets no fermion minus sign .",
    "we cope with this by a rung - dependent gauge transformation for the charged bosons and introduce : @xmath90 the extra phasefactor @xmath91 precisely cancels the minus sign in the matrix elements of the two new bosons , so that we can now describe the physics of the bosons by the following manifestly @xmath0 invariant hamiltonian @xmath92 here @xmath93 denotes the 5-dimensional vector @xmath94 in terms of this @xmath95-dimensional boson - vector on a single rung the @xmath96 root generators of @xmath0 take the simple form ( suppressing the rung index ) @xmath97 which for @xmath98 reduces to a representation of the @xmath1 spin operators in the rung basis@xcite .",
    "bearing in mind that the @xmath93 are hard - core bosons , it is straightforward to show that the operators ( [ root ] ) obey the @xmath0 angular momentum algebra@xcite : @xmath99 = -i ( \\delta_{ad } l_{bc } -\\delta_{ac } l_{bd } + \\delta_{bc } l_{ad } -\\delta_{bd } l_{ac } ) .",

    "+ we can also express the @xmath0 hard - core boson hamiltonian ( [ heff1 ] ) directly in terms of a @xmath0 quantum nonlinear @xmath108 model hamiltonian by introducing the @xmath0 superspin vector at a given rung as @xmath109 and its conjugate momentum as @xmath110 in this representation , the symmetry generator takes the more familiar form @xmath111 using these operator identities , the @xmath0 hard - core boson hamiltonian ( [ heff1 ] ) can be expressed as ( repeated @xmath0 indices are summed over ! ) @xmath112 this hamiltonian is quantized using the @xmath0 commutation relations ( [ so5_algebra ] ) and @xmath113 = -i ( \\delta_{bc } x_a - \\delta_{ac } x_b ) , \\ ] ] together with the hard core constraint @xmath114 the @xmath0 ladder model can be used for a particularly simple and transparent demonstration of the key feature of the @xmath0 theory , namely the one - to - one correspondence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity .",
    "the ground state of the ladder models is actually an rvb type of vacuum without af long - range - order .",
    "however , for illustrative purposes , let us now construct an af ordered state ( which is in general not a eigenstate of the hamiltonian ) by condensing the magnons into the rvb ground state . we can obviously express the operator of staggered magnetization in @xmath46-direction as @xmath115 where e.g. @xmath116 projects onto states where the @xmath61 rung has the configuration @xmath117",

    "+ this calculation shows that by starting from an ` rvb vacuum ' , an antiferromagnetically ordered state with @xmath124 in @xmath46-direction can be generated by condensing @xmath46-like triplet - excitations into the @xmath121@xmath41@xmath104 state . at this point",
    "we can invoke the @xmath0 symmetry of the model , which tells us that since the @xmath46-like triplet with momentum @xmath104 and the hole pair with momentum @xmath19 are two different components of a 5-vector ( the difference in momenta is precisely absorbed by the gauge transformation ( [ bosons ] ) we needed to make the signs of hopping integrals consistent ) , they are dynamically indistinguishable .",
    "this means that the af state , with condensed triplets , can be @xmath0-rotated into a state with condensed hole pairs .",
    "it follows that if the antiferromagnetic state were the ground state at half - filling ( which is the case for 2d materials ) we can replace all @xmath46-like triplets by hole pairs with momentum @xmath19 and by @xmath0 symmetry automatically obtain the ground state in the doped case .",
    "the latter then consists of hole - pairs along the rungs condensed into the @xmath103 states and thus is necessarily superconducting . in other words : both the antiferromagnetic and the superconducting state may be viewed as some kind of condensate ` on top of ' the rung - rvb state .",
    "@xmath0 symmetry then simply implies that the condensed objects are combined into a single vector , whence the unification of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity follows in a most natural way .",
    "+ the above derivation makes sense only in a strong coupling limit , where a discussion starting out from rung - singlets makes sense .",
    "one might expect , however , that similar considerations will apply also for cases with a weak coupling within the rungs@xcite .",
    "+ to conclude this section , we discuss what will happen if we switch off the correction terms ( [ hcorr ] ) , which were introduced so as to enforce exact @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the crucial question is whether above considerations will retain some validity or break down alltogether .",
    "let us consider the @xmath125 plane of the @xmath95-dimensional space , i.e. the ` charge - like subspace ' . in the fully @xmath0-symmetric model the vector @xmath93 can be rotated freely in this plane .",
    "the total charge is related to the angular momentum in the @xmath125 plane , since @xmath126 . for a system with a large charge gap compared with the spin gap",
    ", one can apply a chemical potential to lower the energy of the empty rungs @xmath127 at the cost of further increasing the energy of the fourfold occupied rungs @xmath128 .",
    "the chemical potential acts like a magnetic field normal to the @xmath125 plane , and selects a particular sense of the rotation in the @xmath125 plane .",
    "therefore , the  free rotor \" in the exact @xmath0 symmetric models becomes a  chiral rotor \" in the more realistic hubbard or @xmath3 models .",
    "+ in terms of the boson model , switching off @xmath129 will lead to different energies for the different boson species , i.e. a replacement of the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 corresponds to the binding energy of a hole pair ( relative to the rung singlet ) and @xmath132 .",
    "here we are neglecting the modification of the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath133 . while @xmath134 is a huge energy , let us assume that we have a state with @xmath135 and treat this term in perturbation theory .",
    "the crucial point is now , that for total electron density @xmath136 the fourfold occupied rung @xmath137 is admixed only as a quantum fluctuation , so that we expect for the change in energy @xmath138 in the limit @xmath139 the main effect of switching to the physical hubbard or @xmath3 model _ in the hole - doped subspace _ thus is adding a chemical potential - like term @xmath140 to the hamiltonian .",
    "apart from that , having @xmath141 for states with @xmath142 merely corresponds to projecting out quantum fluctuations involving charged bosons .",
    "this may be expected to have only a minor effect .",
    "of course states with @xmath143 will have their energies shifted by @xmath144 , so that @xmath0 rotations into this sector of the hilbert space become forbidden .",
    "as long as we restrict ourselves to hole - doped states , however , one may hope that @xmath0 symmetry remains approximately valid .",
    "below we will present an explicit numerical check of this more qualitative discussion .",
    "in this section we shall briefly review the @xmath0 group theory and classify all states in the ladder model according to irreducible representations ( irreps ) of the @xmath0 lie algebra .",
    "we also discuss various @xmath0 selection rules which shall be used in the next two sections .",

    "the @xmath150 irreps form a square in the @xmath39 plane and are the spinor states found in systems with odd number of electrons .",
    "for example , the quintet @xmath76 manifold with 3 magnons and 2 pair states carry the label @xmath151 , while the quartet @xmath77 manifold with one or three electrons per rung carries the label @xmath152 .",
    "the intermediate multiplets @xmath153 are the evolution from the square to the diamond ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",

    "we have verified that from the ground states up to the highest excited states all eigenstates of the system can be classified into the multiplets shown in figure [ fig3 ] ( and more complicated ones ) . for the @xmath47 system , where a full digonalization is not feasible anymore",

    "we    = 7.5 cm    therefore expect four distinct bands in the spectrum .",
    "if , on the other hand , one takes a spin - polarized or doped state of the same multiplet as the initial state for photoemssion and inverse photoemission we expect to see only three bands since there are only three possible transitions according to the selection rules ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we expect the _ very same _ spectrum for both the polarized and the doped case since the initial states belong to the same initial multiplet as well as all target states belong to the same target multiplets and are therefore degenerate .",
    "we now want to see the practical application of the selection rules discussed in the preceeding section .",

    "final states can only belong to the @xmath167-dimensional @xmath152 representation , see figure [ fig3 ] . despite the fact that we are using very strong interaction parameters ,",
    "there is just one single electron - like band in pes , whose dispersion closely follows the noninteracting dispersion .",
    "the center of gravity of this band is given by the energy difference between a rung - singlet and a singly occupied rung , i.e. @xmath168 , i.e. @xmath169 with our present parameter values .",
    "we proceed to the spectrum of the @xmath170 state , with @xmath148@xmath41@xmath19 - this state    belongs to the fivefold degenerate @xmath171 multiplet . from figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we expect final states belonging to both the @xmath172 and the @xmath152 representation .",
    "it appears as if the bands seen in the ground state spectra remain practically unchanged - as a new feature , howewer , there appear some weak ` sidebands ' close to @xmath173 .",
    "they can be seen both in photoemission and in inverse photoemisson , so that we obviously have precisely the @xmath167 bands expected on the basis of our discussion of selection rules given above ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the physical interpretation is straightforward .",
    "the @xmath170 state has a single triplet - like boson .",
    "the ` main bands ' , which are similar to those in the ground state spectra , correspond to final states where the photohole is generated in a singlet - rung .",
    "they therefore contain the original triplet , plus a singly occupied rung which propagates through the ladder and carries the entire momentum transfer .",
    "these states therefore belong to the @xmath172 representation .",
    "the center of gravity of this band is again at @xmath174 .",
    "the two excitations ( triplet and hole ) now can scatter from each other , whence the respective band becomes broadened .",
    "there is however also a second process , namely the photohole can be created in the rung occupied by the triplet .",
    "this creates final states containing only a singly occupied rung , which must therefore belong to the @xmath152 representation .",
    "as the intensity of this second process is proportional to the triplet density , our interpretation of the sidebands can be checked numerically by comparing the mean weight of the sidebands for one - triplet - states on ladders with different numbers of rungs .",
    "on 4- , 6- , and 8-rung ladders ( which corresponds to triplet densities of @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 ) and with our parameter values , we found mean weights of @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180  a convincing proof of the interpretation given above .",
    "the center of gravity    of the resulting band is at the energy difference between a rung triplet and a singly occupied rung , @xmath181 , i.e. @xmath182 with our parameters . in this type of process",
    "the photohole has to absorb also the momentum of the triplet , @xmath105 , so that the _ dispersion _ of this band is precisely the same as that of the ` main band ' seen for the @xmath183 ground state , but shifted by @xmath105 ( note however the rigid shift of the band by @xmath184 due to the difference in initial state energy ) .",
    "literally the same arguments hold for the inverse photoemisison part , and inspection of figure [ fig6 ] shows that all of these features are observed .",
    "+ so far we have seen that spin excitations in the ground state generate additional sidebands in the single particle spectrum . at this point , however , we can invoke the exact @xmath0 symmetry of the model , which tells us that spin polarization and hole / electron doping are equivalent , in that the empty rung is the ` @xmath0 partner ' of the triplet rung .",
    "consequently , figure [ fig7 ] compares the single particle spectrum of the @xmath185 and @xmath170 states .",
    "both states belong to the same @xmath151 representation - unambiguous evidence is provided by the fact that their energies agree to computer accuracy . in figure [ fig7 ]",
    "we have chosen the @xmath148@xmath41@xmath186 member of the triplet , and study the annihilation of a @xmath187-electron .",
    "> from figure [ fig5 ] we expect that this simulation probes exclusively the @xmath172 representation . since the final states for these two different processes belong to the same @xmath0 multiplet , we expect their amplitudes to be directly related .",
    "more precisely we have @xmath188 , with @xmath189 , whence : @xmath190\\ ; c_{\\bbox{k}\\downarrow } |^1(0,0)_{-1 } \\rangle , \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\langle^1(0,0)_{-1}| c_{\\bbox{k}\\downarrow } ^\\dagger\\frac{1}{\\omega + h-\\epsilon_0 } c_{\\bbox{k}\\downarrow } |^1(0,0)_{-1 } \\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the fact that the @xmath191 operator commutes with @xmath192 and the hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , it annihilates the @xmath193 state .",
    "since they belong to the same @xmath0 multiplet , the energies of the @xmath194 and the @xmath195 state are identical , i.e. @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , as we indeed see in figure [ fig7 ] , these two correlation functions are completely identical ( within computer accuracy in the simulation ) .",
    "the physical reason is that the photohole can not be created in the triplet rung ( because the latter contains two @xmath196-electrons ) . in other words ,",
    "when ` seen through the eyes of the photohole - operator ' the triplet rung looks like it were ` empty ' , i.e. occupied by holes .",
    "_ @xmath0 symmetry thus implies that the single particle spectra in the doped ground states actually are _ identical _ to those of certain states at half - filling_. @xmath0 thus presents a very obvious rationalization for the rigid - band behavior observed numerically in the single particle spectra of the 2d @xmath3 model@xcite .",
    "+ next , we return to the photoemission spectrum for the @xmath148@xmath41@xmath19 member of the @xmath170 state . in this case",
    ", the photohole can be generated in the triplet rung , and , as discussed above , the sidebands near @xmath173 appear .",
    "the corresponding final states have only one singly occupied rung remaining in the system .",
    "then , precisely the same kind    of state results if a photoelectron is _ created _ in an empty rung . the only difference is , that in the former case the photohole has to absorb the momentum of the triplet i.e. @xmath105",
    "we can conclude that the sideband seen in pes at half - filling must disappear in pes for the two - hole case , but reappear in ipes , shifted by @xmath105 .",
    "this can also be seen explicitly by the following identity : @xmath197 where the second term in the last equation arises from the nonvanishing commutator between @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "this identity implies that @xmath200.\\ ] ] remarkably enough , the photoemission spectrum @xmath201 of the half - filled triplet @xmath159 state is related to the photoemission spectrum @xmath202 and inverse photoemission spectrum @xmath203 of the two hole ground state .",
    "inspection of figure [ fig8 ] shows the three spectra in question demonstrates that the photoemission spectrum for the doped ground state ( full line ) indeed is simply the _",
    "mean _ of the two spectra computed for the doped case .",
    "+ all in all , the preceeding discussion has shown that @xmath0 symmetry leads to at first sight unexpected behavior in the single - particle spectral function : since spin - polarization and hole doping are equivalent under @xmath0 , the pes spectra of half - filled but spin - polarized states are identical to those of doped states .",
    "this may be the key to understand the rigid - band behavior observed @xcite in the 2d @xmath3 model .",
    "moreover , sidebands which appear in pes on spin - excited states at half - filling and which originate from processes where a spin excitation is annihilated , reappear in ipes on hole - doped states .",
    "again , this was found previously also for the 2d @xmath3 model@xcite .",
    "we note that the spectroscopies shown in figures [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] , and [ fig8 ] have been performed for the actual 2d @xmath3 model as well and have produced results in strong support of @xmath0@xcite .",
    "our rung - boson model gives a description of the physics in terms of spinful and charged 2-electron excitations , and thus should be directly applicable to a discussion of the spin and charge dynamics .",
    "we introduce the spin correlation function ( scf ) and the density correlation function ( dcf ) as @xmath204 where @xmath205 and @xmath57 denote the operator of @xmath46-spin and electron density . as a first step",
    "we need representations of these operators in terms of the rung - boson operators @xmath93 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the spin operators for the @xmath61 rung and the two possible momenta in @xmath206-direction are : @xmath207 the spin operator with transverse momentum @xmath19 thus actually corresponds to a two - particle spectrum , and thus will take ( in an infinite system ) the form of a continuum , whereas the spin operator with transverse momentum @xmath104 is a single particle - like spectrum . this difference can indeed be seen in the numerical spin correlation function ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "+ the ` @xmath0 partner ' of the operator @xmath208 therefore is @xmath209 which is related to the creation and annihilation of a singlet electron pair . on the other hand ,",
    "the operator of electron density with transverse momentum @xmath19 is the ` @xmath0 partner ' of @xmath210 : @xmath211 where @xmath212 and @xmath213 were defined in ( [ bosons ] ) . comparing ( [ den0 ] ) , ( [ spin0 ] ) to ( [ root ] ) we note that the density and spin operators for transverse momentum transfer @xmath19 are actually root generators of @xmath0 - it follows that we can invoke the wigner - eckart - theorem ( or intuitive arguments ) to show that the respective spin and density spectra for certain pairs of states are identical .",
    "below we will present various examples . + as for the density operator with transverse momentum transfer @xmath104 , this is much more complicated because this operator annihilates any state corresponding to either charged or spinful bosons .",
    "this correlation function therefore will be determined by the dynamics of the singly and threefold occupied rung , which in our strong coupling limit is admixed only virtually .",
    "we therefore expect that this correlation function has only weak features at relatively high energies .",
    "+ after these preliminaries we proceed to a discussion of the numerical spectra . with regards to the scf",
    "it is important to keep in mind that all following spectra have been computed using the @xmath46-component of the spin operator .",
    "+ the half - filled ground state does not contain any bosonic excitation at all .",
    "we can obtain a nonvanishing scf only by coupling to the weakly admixed singly and threefold occupied rung , and therefore expect an extremely weak signal for @xmath214@xmath41@xmath19 .",
    "final states for the scf with @xmath214@xmath41@xmath104 are in the @xmath152 representation , and the dominant peak in the respective spectra therefore gives the dispersion of the triplet boson ( see figure [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "choosing now the lowest of these @xmath151 states , the @xmath170 , as the initial state for the calculation of the scf with @xmath214@xmath41@xmath19 , the triplet boson with momentum @xmath121@xmath41@xmath104 could in principle be scattered into a state with momentum @xmath215 , where @xmath121 is the momentum transfer along the ladder . since we are using the @xmath148 operator",
    ", however , this is not possible ( see the representation ( [ spin0 ] ) ) if we use the @xmath148@xmath41@xmath19 member of the @xmath170 state .",
    "we therefore expect a very low intensity spectrum which again is due to virtually admixed singly and three - fold occupied rungs . moreover , since the @xmath46-like triplet acts precisely like a hole pair , and since the hole    pair can not be excited by the spin operator either , the @xmath214@xmath41@xmath19 spectra of the @xmath170 state with @xmath148@xmath41@xmath19 and the @xmath185 ground state must be identical by @xmath0 symmetry ( which indeed they are , compare figure [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "the situation changes completely if we use the @xmath148@xmath41@xmath186 member of the @xmath170 triplet as initial state ( see figure [ fig10 ] ) : this state contains a mixture of the @xmath216-like and @xmath206-like triplet , which both can be excited by the @xmath148-operator with @xmath214@xmath41@xmath19 .",
    "we will therefore see a strong peak , with essentially the same dispersion as the dominant peak in the @xmath214@xmath41@xmath104 spectra in figure [ fig9 ] , but shifted by @xmath217@xmath41@xmath218 in momentum and by @xmath219 in energy . on the other hand acting with the @xmath46-like spin operator with @xmath214@xmath41@xmath104",
    "creates or annihilates a @xmath46-like boson .",
    "then , in both states , @xmath170 with @xmath148@xmath41@xmath186 and @xmath185 , annihilation of a @xmath46-like boson is not possible . creating a @xmath46-like boson",
    ", we will generate @xmath0 equivalent states , because the created @xmath46-like boson interacts with the one already present in the system ( @xmath216-like , @xmath206-like or hole - like ) in identical ways - the @xmath214@xmath41@xmath104 spectra for these states thus must be identical , which indeed they are ( compare figure [ fig10 ] ) . comparing figure [ fig10 ] with figure [ fig9 ]",
    "we see that the magnon mode with @xmath105 at half - filling evolves continuously into the @xmath104 resonance mode of the two hole state , in accordence with the analysis of reference @xcite . away from @xmath105 ,",
    "a lower energy structure emerges in the scf of the two hole state .",
    "+ on the other hand , when we switch to @xmath170 with @xmath148@xmath41@xmath19 , the parts corresponding to a creation of the @xmath46-like boson are slightly different from the spectra in figure [ fig10 ] because the final state now contains two bosons of equal ( @xmath46-like ) species , which interact differently as compared to unequal species .",
    "+ we proceed to a discussion of the dcf . in the remainder of this section",
    "we will refer only to spectra with @xmath214@xmath41@xmath19 .",
    "it follows by @xmath0 symmetry and ( [ spin0 ] ) , ( [ den0 ] ) that the density operator with @xmath214@xmath41@xmath19 takes a completely analogous form as the spin operator .",
    "when using an @xmath0 singlet as initial state , both operators thus must give the same spectrum .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the scf and dcf for the half - filled ground state , compare figure [ fig9 ] and [ fig12 ] .",
    "they are also identical when acting onto states which contain only @xmath46-like bosons - which can be excited neither by the @xmath148 or the density operator .",
    "this explains the identity of the scf and dcf for the @xmath220 state with @xmath148@xmath41@xmath19 , compare figure [ fig9 ] and figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "+ on the other hand , since the hole pair behaves like a triplet , the dcf for the two - hole ground state must be identical to the scf for the @xmath170 state with @xmath148@xmath41@xmath186 , compare figures [ fig10 ] and [ fig12 ] , right panel .",
    "+ summarizing this section , we have seen that @xmath0 symmetry enforces identity relationships between spin and charge correlation functions for different initial states , which differ by their hole number .",
    "again this implies strong continuity with hole doping .",
    "while such continuity is certain to be present in any system with ( approximate ) @xmath0 symmetry , it should be noted that the    identity relationships in the present case depend very much on the representations ( [ spin0 ] ) and ( [ den0 ] ) of the spin and density operators in terms of the rung bosons . while these are easily transferable to ladder - like systems , analogous identities for a fully planar system may be quite different and more restricted .",
    "so far , we have studied the spectra for the ideal @xmath0 symmetric model . in this section",
    "we want to investigate the effect of discarding the correction terms @xmath129 which enforced exact @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "more precisely our goal is to find , in the spirit of landau s fermi liquid theory , a ` mapping ' between the excitation spectrum of the exactly @xmath0 symmetric but in principle unphysical model , and that of a ` physical ' @xmath3 ladder .",
    "the latter , being the @xmath50@xmath221@xmath222 limit of the hubbard model , incorporates the constraint of no double occupancy which , based on erroneous mean - field calculations , has recently been argued to break @xmath0 symmetry@xcite .",
    "we compare the single particle spectra as well as the spin correlation ( i.e. a two particle spectrum ) of the @xmath0 symmetric ladder and the @xmath3 model for a @xmath223-rung ladder .",
    "thereby we adjust the parameters of the @xmath0 symmetric ladder so as to obtain an optimal fit to the @xmath3 model , for which we fix @xmath224@xmath41@xmath225 and @xmath226@xmath41@xmath225 , @xmath227@xmath41@xmath228 .",
    "we are using a relatively large value of the exchange along the rungs , @xmath66 - this is by no means adequate to describe actual materials , but our main goal here is to investigate the effect of the constraint of no double occupancies in the @xmath3 model .",
    "note that the @xmath3 model has a ` hubbard gap ' which is effectively infinite , whereas in the @xmath0 symmetric ladder hole - doped to electron - doped states are degenerate .",
    "the models thus appear at first sight entirely unrelated , but our goal is to check our above conjecture that as long as we restrict ourselves to the hole doped sector , the two models still can well have essentially the same low - energy dynamics .",
    "+ figure [ fig13 ] and figure [ fig14 ] show the photoemission spectra originating from the half - filled ground state @xmath183 , and @xmath170 with @xmath148@xmath41@xmath19 , the overall agreement of the two model s spectra was obtained choosing @xmath229@xmath41@xmath167 , @xmath230@xmath41@xmath231 , @xmath226@xmath41@xmath60 , and @xmath224@xmath41@xmath232 for the exactly @xmath0 symmetric model , followed by an energy rescaling by a factor of @xmath233 ( which amounts to setting @xmath234@xmath41@xmath235 ) .",
    "the resulting mapping is excellent : the @xmath3 model s number of peaks , their weight distribution and dispersion are accurately obtained also in the exactly @xmath0 symmetric model .",
    "in particular , the appearance of the ` sidebands ' in the spectra for spin polarized ground states can be nicely seen for both models . regarding the spin correlation for the same set of parameters ( figure [ fig15 ] )",
    ", there is still good agreement as to the    number and the weight of the peaks and the character of the dispersion .",
    "the absolute size of the dispersion is somewhat smaller in the exact @xmath0 model but the value of the ` spin gap ' at @xmath105 is reproduced quite accurately .",
    "alltogether , the mapping between the ` unphysical ' but exactly @xmath0 symmetric model and the physically better founded @xmath3 model is reasonably good , which clearly supports the physical relevance of @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we also note that the calculations are ` as close as possible ' to half - filling , where the impact of the hilbert - space projection still is presumably the largest in the @xmath3 model - yet the agreement of the low - energy physics is obviously quite good .",
    "one therefore may hope that similar mappings can be carried out also for more realistic parameter values of @xmath3 ladders , so that for @xmath3 and hubbard ladders the @xmath0 symmetric model may in fact be the generic effective hamiltonian .",
    "this is further supported by numerical studies in the case of large @xmath50@xmath41@xmath236 , @xmath12@xmath41@xmath19@xcite recently carried out by duffy , haas and kim , and renormalizatiion group calculations@xcite for the weak coupling case .",
    "in summary , we have studied the dynamics of an exactly @xmath0 symmetric ladder model .",
    "we have shown that in the strong - coupling limit the model reduces to the simplest possible @xmath0 symmetric generalization of a bosonic model derived previously by gopalan _",
    "et al._@xcite for the spin excitations of heisenberg ladders . in this limit",
    "the ` vacuum ' of the theory is the rung - rvb state , and the elementary excitations of the @xmath0 symmetric ladder correspond to uncharged triplet - like and charged singlet - like bosons .",
    "@xmath0 symmetry then simply states that the spin - like and charge - like bosons are dynamically equivalent , in the same sense as e.g. proton and neutron are considered dynamically equivalent in the isospin theory of nuclear physics . in the strong coupling limit , the low energy physics can be mapped onto a model of five species of hard - core bosons .",
    "the effective non - linear @xmath108 model description@xcite can be systematically derived in this limit .",
    "+ because the ground state of the ladder system is a mott insulator with  rvb type \" of singlet vacuum",
    ", it can serve as a reference state to consider the condensation of magnons and charged bosons on the equal footing , thereby revealing the precise analogy between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity . in a 2d system , no such reference state is found to be the ground state for any reasonable hamiltonian in the infinite system . however , the ground state of any finite cluster is a total spin singlet , and recent numerical calculations @xcite demonstrate that the ground state of the @xmath3 or hubbard model is also approximately a @xmath0 singlet .",
    "the low energy excitations of the 2d cluster are magnons and hole pairs , and share many similarities to the properties of the @xmath0 ladder system found in this work . + as shown in the present work , @xmath0 symmetry has profound implications for the dynamical correlation functions , most notably the single particle spectrum .",
    "specific predictions of @xmath0 , like a ` generalized rigid band behaviour'@xcite and the appearance of sidebands in the inverse photoemission spectrum@xcite may indeed have been observed long ago in the actual 2d @xmath3 model .",
