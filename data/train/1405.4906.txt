    "in recent years , significant improvements in optical and mechanical elements have led to the development of the field of optomechanics , where mechanical oscillators couple optical fields via the radiation pressure of light @xcite . as for force measurements such as gravitational - wave ( gw ) detectors @xcite , in which the mechanical oscillator is used as a probe of external force , its sensitivity has almost been limited by the standard quantum limit ( sql ) , whose ( double - sided ) power spectrum is given by @xcite @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is the angular frequency , @xmath2 the reduced planck constant , @xmath3 the mass of the oscillator , @xmath4 the amplitude mechanical decay rate ( i.e. , the mechanical quality factor @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 the mechanical susceptibility .",
    "also , theoretical analysis has proven that there is a connection between reaching the sql imposed on the free mass ( so - called free - mas sql ) and the generation of entanglement states , even between massive mechanical oscillators such as suspended mirrors @xcite .",
    "because of the massiveness , such states might have a key to investigate effects concerning macroscopic quantum mechanics , such as the gravity decoherence @xcite .",
    "therefore , optomechanics is not only useful as sensitive probes for the weak force , but also leads to possibilities of testing fundamental problems .",
    "one of the key milestones toward the sql is the observation of quantum back - action , whose power spectrum is given by @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the total decay rate of the cavity , @xmath10 the cavity susceptibility , and @xmath11 the light - enhanced optomechanical coupling constant .",
    "also , we naturally assume that the linewidth of the cavity is sufficiently larger than sum of the sideband frequency and the cavity detuning .",
    "the quantum back - action is a measurement - disturbance derived from the heisenberg uncertainty principle ( hup ) @xcite , and thus this is the force noise . in order to reach the sql ,",
    "the force noise should be dominated by the quantum back - action ; however , measurements are usually dominated by a strong thermal fluctuating force , whose power spectrum is given by @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath14 is the temperature .",
    "thus , reaching the sql needs the condition : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the phonon occupation number . to reduce the thermal noise",
    ", one can freely suspend a massive mirror in order to allow the mirror to be isolated from the environment .",
    "the pendulum motion of the suspended mirror is dominantly trapped by the gravitational potential , and thus the dissipation of the pendulum is gravitationally diluted by a factor of @xmath17 ( in this paper , we call it `` q enhancement factor '' ) @xcite , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the gravitational and elastic spring constants of the pendulum , @xmath20 is the radius of the wire , @xmath21 is the length of the wire , @xmath3 is the mass of the mirror , @xmath22 is the young s module of the wire , and @xmath23 is the gravitational acceleration . from eq .",
    "( [ thermal ] ) , any reduction of the dissipation results in a reduction of a thermal fluctuation force , which also drives the mechanical motion similarly to the quantum back - action , by a factor of @xmath24 .",
    "although this isolation largely reduces the suspension thermal noise , a stationary radiation force of the light exposes the free mass to instability through an optical torsional anti - spring effect as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , which is given by @xmath25 , in conventional experiments utilizing a linear optical cavity @xcite ( we suppose that the g - parameter closes to zero , which results in the smallest anti - restoring force ) . here , @xmath26 is the intra - cavity power , @xmath27 the round - trip length of the cavity , and c the speed of light .",
    "the stable condition concerning both the mechanical restoring force of the wire @xmath28 and the optical anti - restoring force @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 thus , @xmath31 should be satisfied in the case of using a single wire to suspend , where @xmath32 is the modulus of rigidity of the wire .",
    "this technical limitation becomes a significant issue , because a fundamental compromise between the stability and the sensitivity is generated ; sufficient tolerance with firm suspension increases dissipation of the pendulum through the decrease of the gravitational dilution , which results in the increase of the thermal fluctuating force .        as a result ,",
    "the enhancement of @xmath33 due to the gravitational dilution is limited by @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the q enhancement factor , and @xmath36 the round - trip time , @xmath37 the poisson s ratio , and @xmath38 the input laser power .",
    "the ratio of @xmath33 in the case of using the linear cavity is plotted as a function both of the input laser power and the q enhancement factor in fig . [ fig2](a ) .    in this paper , we describe using a triangular optical cavity to overcome this limitation , and then propose an experiment to reach the sql .    .",

    "the suspended mirror was attached to an oxigen - free copper cylinder of 3 mm diameter and 3 mm thickness , which was damped by an eddy - current using a doughnut - shaped magnet .",
    "because of its shape , the magnet damps only the pendulum motion without decreasing the mechanical quality factor of the yaw motion .",
    "the resonant frequency of the yaw motion was measured to be 369 mhz , by optical shadow sensing .",
    "the curved mirror was fixed , and was mounted on a piezoelectric transducer ( pzt ; nec tokin , ae0505d08f ) , which was used as an actuator to keep the cavity in resonance with the laser .",

    "( [ reso ] ) is suitable for modeling the torsional spring effect caused by the optical restoring force .",
    "from this result and the following consideration , the advantage of the triangular cavity can be understood .",
    "when the linear cavity is used , the instability can be mitigated by , e.g. , : ( i ) reducing the optical power ; ( ii ) shortening the cavity length ; ( iii ) using a thick wire for suspension ; ( iv ) using multiple wires for suspension ; ( v ) using the long wire ; ( vi ) active control ; and ( vii ) using a linear optical cavity that consists of fixed and suspended mirrors under the _ negative_-g condition ( i.e. , both focal points are inside the cavity ; in other words , both mirrors have a concaved structure )",
    ". however , those induce : ( i ) a reduction of the quantum back - action ; ( ii ) an increase of the linewidth of the cavity ( i.e. , reduction of laser frequency noise ) ; however , in practice it is insufficient only by it ; ( iii ) a reduction of the gravitational dilution ( i.e. , increasing the suspension thermal noise ) ; ( iv ) introducing an unexpected thermal noise through the unexpected normal mode generated by the complicated suspension system @xcite ; ( v ) a decrease of the resonant frequency of the violin mode ; ( vi ) the necessity of using a more macroscopic mirror to be attached along with the actuator , which would result in decreasing the sql ( i.e. , relatively increase of all technical noise ) , and also might introduce some other dissipation through the actuator ( to avoid these issues , using the lossless control system via radiation pressure without attached actuators has been proposed @xcite ) ; and ( vii ) the necessary of using a sufficiently concaved and small mirror in order to make the cavity length shorten and avoid the same issue of the first part of ( vi ) .",
    "( if an appropriate mirror can be manufactured , this method has no issue .",
    "we have been trying , but it is still challenging . ) on the other hand , the triangular cavity has an _ intrinsic _ stability in yaw direction . as a result , one can conclude that the triangular cavity overcomes the fundamental compromise .    until now ,",
    "we have only paid attention to the yaw .",
    "note that this is a sufficient discussion in order to consider the stability of our triangular cavity . because the suspended mirror can easily have sufficient mechanical positive torsional spring constants for a pitch without increasing the suspension thermal noise , even though the anti - torsional spring effect occurs for the pitch .",
    "this is due to the fact that the stiffness of the pitch does not depend on the radius of the wire , which mainly determines the q enhancement factor , but depends on the radius of the mirror .",
    "also , as for damping effect , it is generally stable , because phase delay of the optical torque is generally much smaller than that of the mechanical torque in the case of using a short length cavity , and thus the optomechanical damping effect can be negligible .",
    "the peak at around 10 hz is the rocking mode and at around 2 khz is the 1-st violin mode of the wire , respectively .",
    ", width=374 ]    our demonstration shows that the triangular cavity is intrinsically stable in yaw direction , and thus it can become an effective system to reach the sql .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows a design sensitivity for reaching the sql , by using the triangular cavity composed of one movable mirror and two fixed mirrors .",
    "we consider a tiny mirror of 5 mm in diameter and 0.3 mm in thickness , leading to a mass of 14.7  mg .",
    "the tiny mirror is suspended by a single thin tungsten wire ( 1 @xmath70 m in diameter and 20 mm in length ) .",
    "here , we suppose the dissipation mechanism is due to internal friction ( frequency independent internal friction ) . in addition",
    ", we suppose that the intrinsic quality factor of the wire is 3,800 , since the mechanical quality factor of the tungsten wire with 3 @xmath70 m in diameter was measured to be 3,800 @xcite .",
    "the quality factor of pendulum can be improved up to @xmath75 due to the gravitational dilution . in this case ,",
    "suspension thermal noise is shown in fig.[fig6 ] as a red line .",
    "mechanical quality factors of the coating and the silica structure of the movable mirror are estimated to be @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively . the mirror thermal noise ( sum of the coating and the substrate thermal noise )",
    "is shown in fig.[fig6 ] as a green line .",
    "the blue line shows the quantum noise ( i.e. , the quantum back - action and the shot noise ) .",
    "the input laser power is 5 mw , which results in the intra - cavity power of 3.2 w. although the laser power is about 10,000-times higher than the instability limit for the linear cavity , it is relatively weak .",
    "this is because that the frequency , where the sql equals the sum of the quantum noises ( @xmath78 hz ) should be smaller than the frequency , where the sql equals the mirror thermal noise ( @xmath79 2 khz ) .    as a result ,",
    "the sql can be reached in the range of about 240 to 1,700 hz , even at the room temperature .",
    "we measured a radiation - pressure induced angular ( yaw ) spring effect in the triangular optical cavity .",
    "theoretical calculation shows good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "this result suggests that the triangular cavity is intrinsically stable in yaw direction , and thus it is possible to store high power beam in the triangular cavity with a large gravitational dilution .",
    "therefore , the triangular cavity can overcome the trade - off between the stability and the sensitivity concerning the linear cavity .",
    "moreover , we propose the experiment using the triangular cavity , in order to reach the standard quantum limit at beyond the resonant frequency of the pendulum .",
