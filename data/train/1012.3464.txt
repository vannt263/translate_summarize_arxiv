    "strongly correlated electron systems have challenged traditional condensed matter paradigms with weakly interacting quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , theory tools originating from high - energy physics have been useful in addressing the physical properties of these materials , ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the anti de - sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence has proved successful in the investigation of strong - coupling gauge theories @xcite with its first application focusing on conformally invariant theories .",
    "other non - relativistic scaling symmetries have been proposed in the context of holography involving schrdinger symmetry @xcite or lifshitz symmetry @xcite .",
    "the progress in geometric realizations of schrdinger symmetry , with a general dynamical exponent z , aimed for condensed matter applications has paved the way to finite temperature generalizations @xcite using the null melvin twist @xcite .    ads space in the light - cone frame ( alcf ) with z=2 , has also been put forward @xcite , as such a holographic background and a corresponding schwarzschild black hole solution have been considered @xcite .",
    "notably , while schrdinger space and alcf yield the same thermodynamic properties @xcite and transport coefficients ( when the latter are independent of an embedding scalar ) @xcite , alcf is simpler and has a well - defined holographic renormalization",
    ".    here we will analyze and report on the transport properties of alcf , matching several universal experimental results of the normal - state of cuprates superconductors at very low temperatures , which have been a subject of intensive research and yet remain largely unexplained over the past two decades . while there are other types experimental data available , such as spectroscopy and thermodynamic data , we choose to analyze transport data because an understanding of the normal state transport properties of high @xmath3 cuprates is widely regarded as a key step towards the elucidation of the pairing mechanism for high - temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the holographic model we present provides a novel paradigm for the normal state of strange metals , in particular high - temperature superconducting ( high @xmath3 ) cuprates in the overdoped region , where the charge carriers added to the parent insulator exceed the value necessary for optimal superconductivity . further to describing the puzzling normal state properties of these materials , our approach leads to new falsifiable predictions for experiment .",
    "in particular , we successfully describe the @xmath4 behavior of the resistivity in @xcite and the @xmath4 behavior of the inverse hall angle observed in @xcite at _ very low temperatures _",
    "@xmath5 , where a single scattering rate is present .",
    "this newly emerging very low temperature scaling behaviors of magnetotransport properties are in accord with the distinct origin of the criticality at very low temperatures advertised in @xcite , while the higher temperature , @xmath6 , scaling has different behaviors between the linear temperature resistivity and the quadratic temperature inverse hall angle , signaling two scattering rates @xcite .",
    "in searching for quantum criticality at zero temperature and its possible connection to the origin of superconductivity , we concentrate on the lower temperature regime with a single scattering process .",
    "we also comment on how two scattering processes emerge by incorporating other mechanisms present in our model .",
    "in addition to the resistivity and inverse hall angle , very good agreement is also found with experimental results of the hall coefficient , magnetoresistance and khler rule on various high @xmath3 cuprates @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , no other model that describes all of these observables successfully .",
    "our model provides a change of paradigm from the notion of a quantum critical point , as it is quantum critical at @xmath7 on the entire overdoped region . in this sense",
    "our work breaks apart from other holographic approaches @xcite , where the measured transport is due to loop fermion effects . as such",
    ", it is applicable to a more general class of materials _ e.g. , _ @xmath8 and @xmath9-electron systems , where the low temperature resistivity varies as @xmath10 @xcite and exhibit a quantum critical line @xcite .",
    "there have been several works that use holographic approaches in order to model strange metal behavior .",
    "the fermionic structure of such systems in the ir has been analyzed in @xcite and modifications due to dipole couplings in @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was found that there is an ir scaling symmetry that could allow the realization of a marginal fermi liquid .",
    "the ir exponent would need , however , to be tuned for this to take place .",
    "the linear temperature dependence of the ohmic resistivity was realized in spaces with ads or lifshitz scaling @xcite and in schrdinger space @xcite .",
    "a linear resistivity and a crossover to quadratic behavior was found in a larger class of scaling geometries in @xcite . in the same reference ,",
    "the full set of possible holographic non - trivial low temperature behavior was classified and , as shown in @xcite , comprises all possible classes of quantum critical behavior in theories with a single scalar ir relevant operator dominating the dynamics .",
    "finally , the temperature behavior of the hall angle was addressed using lifshitz type metric with broken rotational symmetry @xcite .     in section",
    "[ sec : schrgeometry ] , we provide the basic information for the gravity background , including how to interpret the background compared to the extensively studied ads .",
    "then , we provide detailed properties and calculations of the transport data using the probe dbi technique in section [ sec : transport ] .",
    "magnetotransport coefficients are calculated and analyzed in section [ sec : halltransport ] , where we also include the analysis of higher - temperature transport properties .",
    "our data is compared to the experimental results available in the literature , focusing on the universal features in section [ exp ] .",
    "strong interactions of realistic finite - density systems have provided an arena for a wealth of techniques , geared to assess in most cases the qualitative physics .",
    "a wide range of unsolved problems remain to be addressed , especially in the realm of strange metals including condensed matter systems on the border with magnetism .",
    "there is , therefore , an inviting opportunity for new techniques and approaches to contribute in these challenging problems in modern condensed matter .",
    "an interdisciplinary approach towards this aim is the utilization of the gauge - gravity correspondence , abstracted from the correspondence between non - abelian gauge theories and string theories .",
    "so far it has been explored in several directions , providing a novel perspective both in the modelization as well as solution of some strongly coupled qfts .",
    "the hope behind potential applications to condensed matter physics is that ir strong interactions of the kondo type in materials , where spins can interact with electrons , may provide bound states that behave in a range of energies as non - abelian gauge degrees of freedom that may also be coupled to other fields .",
    "the gauge interactions are characterized by a number of charges @xmath11 that are conventionally called  colors \" .",
    "their actual number depends on the problem at hand but it is typically small .",
    "if this is the case , then in terms of the electrons and spins , the ym fields are composite . in the regime where the effective ym interaction is strong ,",
    "the physical degrees of freedom are expected to be colorless bound states .",
    "their residual interactions , analogous to nuclear forces in high - energy physics , are still strong . on the other hand",
    ", the effective interaction between colorless bound states can be made arbitrarily weak in the limit of a large number of colors , @xmath12 , as it is controlled by @xmath13 , although the original interaction of colored sources is strong . in this limit ,",
    "the theory is simplified and may be calculable .",
    "of course , typically , the original problem has a finite and sometimes small number of effective colors .",
    "the question then is : how reliable are the large @xmath11 estimates for the real physics of the system ?",
    "the answer to this varies , and we know many examples in both classes of answers .",
    "a good example on one side is the fundamental theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics based on the gauge group su(3 ) , indicating @xmath14 colors .",
    "it is by now established that for many aspects of this theory , @xmath15 , the accuracy varies in the range @xmath16 .",
    "it is also known that the analogous theory with two colors , su(2 ) , has some significant differences from its @xmath17 counterparts .",
    "there are other theories where the behavior at finite @xmath11 is separated from the @xmath18 expansion by phase transitions making large @xmath11 techniques essentially inapplicable .",
    "notably , large @xmath11 techniques have been applied to strongly coupled systems for several decades , and it is therefore natural to ask for the new contribution delivered in the present effort . in adjoint theories in more than two dimensions ,",
    "it is well known that until recently even the leading order in @xmath18 could not be computed .",
    "although some qualitative statements could be made in this limit , the number of quantitative results was rather scarce .",
    "on the other hand , t hooft observed that the leading order in @xmath18 is captured by the classical limit of a quantum string theory @xcite . finding and solving",
    "this classical string theory was therefore equivalent to calculating the leading order result in @xmath18 in the gauge theory .",
    "unfortunately , such string theories , dual to gauge theories , remained elusive until 1997 , when maldacena @xcite made a rather radical proposal : ( a ) this string theory lives in more dimensions than the gauge theory limit , and appear as an extra dimension .",
    "in general how many new dimensions may emerge in a given qft in the large @xmath11 limit is not a straightforward question to answer , although exceptions exist . ] ; ( b ) at strong coupling , it can be approximated by supergravity , a tractable problem .",
    "the concrete example proposed contained on one hand a very symmetric , scale invariant , four - dimensional gauge theory ( n=4 super yang - mills ) , and on the other a ten - dimensional iib string theory compactified on the highly symmetric constant curvature space ads@xmath19 .",
    "therefore , this correspondence becomes to be known as the ads / cft , or holographic , correspondence .",
    "although this claim is a conjecture , it has amassed sufficient evidence to spark considerable theoretical work exploring the ramifications of the correspondence , for the dynamics on one hand of strongly coupled gauge theories and on the other hand of strongly curved string theories .",
    "an important evolution of the holographic correspondence is the advent of the concept of effective holographic theories ( ehts ) @xcite in analogy with the analogous concept of effective field theories ( efts ) in the context of qft .",
    "the rules more or less follow those of efts with some obvious differences and most importantly with less intuition .    in standard efts ,",
    "there are several issues that are relevant : ( a ) derivation of the low energy eft from a higher energy theory ; ( b ) parametrization of the interactions of an eft , and their ordering in terms of ir relevance ; ( c ) physical constraints that an eft must satisfy .",
    "although the wilsonian approach has allowed a good understanding of efts , there are still general questions which can not be answered with our tools , for instance whether a given eft can arise as the ir limit of a uv complete qft .    in the context of holographically dual string theories ,",
    "many issues are still not fully understood .",
    "first and foremost is that the classical string theories dual to gauge theories can not yet be solved .",
    "the only approximation making these tractable is the ( bulk ) derivative expansion .",
    "this reflects the effect of the string oscillations on the dynamics of the low - lying string modes .",
    "it is known in many cases and widely expected that such an expansion is controlled by the strength of the qft interactions . in the limit of infinite strength , the string becomes stiff and the effects of string modes may be completely neglected .",
    "the theory then collapses to a gravitational theory coupled to a finite set of fields .",
    "since we are working to leading order in @xmath18 , the treatment of this theory is purely classical .",
    "observables ( typically boundary observables corresponding to correlators of the dual cft ) are computed by solving second - order non - linear differential equations .",
    "the effects of finite but large coupling are then captured by adding higher - derivative interactions in the gravitational action .",
    "note that this derivative expansion is not directly related to the ir expansion of the dual qft .",
    "the bulk theory , as mentioned earlier , has usually more dimensions compared to those of the dual qft .",
    "one of them is however special : it is known as the  holographic \" or  radial \" dimension , and controls the approach to the boundary of the bulk spacetime .",
    "moreover , it can be interpreted as an  energy \" or renormalization scale in the dual qft .",
    "the second order equations of motion of the bulk gravitational theory , viewed as evolution equations in the radial direction , can be thought of as wilsonian rg evolution equations @xcite .",
    "the boundary of the bulk spacetime corresponds to the uv limit of the qft .",
    "although the equations are second order they need only one boundary condition in order to be solved , as the second condition is supplied by the  regularity \" requirement of the solution at the interior of spacetime . here",
    "gravitational physics proves particularly helpful : a gravitational evolution equation with arbitrary boundary data leads to a singularity . demanding regular solutions gives a unique or a small number of options .",
    "the notion of  regularity \" can however vary , and may include runaway behavior as in the case of holographic open string tachyon condensation relevant for chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the holographic model and associated saddle point we will explore here is rather simple and does not require a very sophisticated machinery .",
    "it has , however , a non - relativistic schrndiger symmetry , and this is a realm that has not been explored fully so far .",
    "the model we present is comprised of two sectors . the first is gravitational and contains the metric as a single field .",
    "it controls the dynamics of energy in the theory , and we will analyze it in this section .",
    "the second contains the dynamics of the charge carriers and will be given by a dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action of a gauge field dual to the conserved current of the carriers .",
    "we will analyze this part in a later section where we will calculate the conductivities .",
    "the gravitational action is the einstein action with a negative cosmological constant @xmath20 where the symbols @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the determinant of the metric , the scalar curvature and the length scale of the theory related to the cosmological constant , respectively .",
    "we suppress the boundary terms needed for proper boundary conditions and renormalization , and consider the ads - schwartzschild black hole solution in light - cone coordinates @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 to ensure z=2 , we assign @xmath26 $ ] ( the scaling dimension of @xmath27 in the unit of mass ) as @xmath28 , and thus @xmath29 = -2 $ ] and @xmath30= 0 $ ] .",
    "the full 10-dimensional space , ads@xmath31 , in light - cone coordinate was written in _",
    "e.g. , _ @xcite@xcite .",
    "we drop the @xmath32 part for the rest of our discussion , except for the embedding scalar discussed below , because it is decoupled and becomes an overall factor in the probe brane dbi action @xcite .    to match the non - relativistic isometry group , one of the light - cone directions , @xmath33 with scaling dimension @xmath34 ,",
    "is identified as time , and we fix the momentum of the other light - cone coordinate , @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the alcf are identical to those of schrdinger space @xcite , explained below in section [ sec : roleofb ] .",
    "the interpretation of this coordinate system is connected to being on the infinite momentum frame along a single spatial direction , which we take here as @xmath36 . in this frame",
    ", the nontrivial physics occurs in the two transverse spatial dimensions @xmath37 .",
    "the initial geometry is the ads schwartzschild black hole , which is known to describe a strongly coupled conformal field theory ( cft ) at finite temperature .",
    "however , here it is described in the light - cone coordinate system and since @xmath38 will be taken as time , the symmetry is broken to a z=2 schrdinger symmetry . in this sense , the bulk background , equations ( [ eq : originalact])-([metriccomponents ] ) ,",
    "describe the strongly coupled `` glue '' that interpolates between conformal symmetry at high temperatures and z=2 lifshitz like non - relativistic scaling symmetry near @xmath39 .    a qualitative way to understand this is to appreciate that in these coordinates the  speed of propagation \" of signals in the bulk spacetime asymptotes to zero as we approach the black - hole horizon .",
    "this is a well known effect in black hole space - times @xcite in this coordinate system - also known as the carolean limit .",
    "this transition , from ads critical ( z=1 ) to lifshitz critical ( z=2 ) , is a key ingredient of the gravitational black hole background .",
    "it is important to identify where the transition occurs . in the bulk background",
    ", this is controlled by the parameter @xmath27 . here",
    ", @xmath27 is a length scale that parametrized precisely this transition , in a way that preserves scale covariance . in brief",
    ", the bulk geometry is an interpolation between ( z=1 ) and ( z=2 ) geometries in the ir .",
    "the associated dual theory should likewise interpolate between two energy regimes , one where it has the usual relativistic scale symmetry and another where it has the lifshitz symmetry .",
    "it should be noted that the gravitational background is 5 dimensional .",
    "apart from the holographic directions , there is a time direction and 3 regular space directions @xmath40 . in light cone coordinates , @xmath41 , one of the spatial coordinates , namely @xmath36 , is playing a special role .",
    "the schrdinger frame can be considered as an infinite boost in the @xmath36 directions ( this is the infinite momentum frame in qft ) as we discuss below . in this limit ,",
    "all dependence on @xmath36 spacial direction is redundant , hence the physics depends only on two spatial directions @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , it is these two spacial directions that the theory depends upon , and the dual quantum field theory is 2 + 1 dimensional .",
    "there are two control parameters in this model , @xmath27 and @xmath42 , which will be introduced in the following section .",
    "both are dimensionful but can form dimensionless combinations either alone or combined with temperature .",
    "the significance of the parameter @xmath27 can be appreciated physically from the thermodynamics of the same system described in @xcite@xcite .",
    "these are as follows : @xmath43 where we have defined @xmath44 and used @xmath45 .",

    "these are consistent with the dimensions of the non - relativistic systems with the dynamical exponent z=2 , as described in appendix f in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath27 can be associated with the chemical potential for the conserved particle number of the schrdinger symmetry .",
    "the dimensionless quantity @xmath58 is associated with the crossover behavior between the z=1 and z=2 regimes of the black hole solutions .",
    "it can be seen from ( [ sc ] ) that @xmath27 controls also the system s response to external pressure .",
    "therefore , different values of @xmath27 correspond to different external pressures for the  glue \" ensemble .",
    "external pressure is a widely used quantum tuning parameter to study the evolution of the ground state electronic properties in a range of strange metals including organic superconductors , heavy fermion systems and other strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "we will now add to the system , charge carriers , using d - branes . to calculate the transport properties , we follow the standard dbi probe approach @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we introduce @xmath59 d7 branes on the background and work in the probe limit , @xmath60 .",
    "the d7 branes cover three angular directions @xmath61 of @xmath32 in addition to the background ( eq .",
    "( [ adsinlightcone ] ) ) . from this embedding",
    "there are two remaining world volume scalars on the branes .",
    "one scalar is chosen to be trivially constant and the other a function of the radial coordinate @xmath62 .",
    "hence , d7 has the same metric as eq .",
    "( [ adsinlightcone ] ) with a simple modification @xmath63 .",
    "we consider the @xmath64 world - volume gauge field @xmath65 , which is dual to the conserved current @xmath66 of the charge carriers . to have an electric field @xmath42 only along the @xmath33 direction , we choose the gauge fields as @xmath67 the light - cone electric field is a vector .",
    "we turn it on in one direction only ( the @xmath68 direction above ) .",
    "the system , however , is rotationally invariant despite appearances for reasons that are explained in appendix [ sec : rotationinvariance ] , along with more detailed calculation of the transport .",
    "the resulting probe dbi action has the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the d - brane s tension , the world - volume coordinate and the @xmath64 field strength , respectively .",
    "there are three constants of motion , which we identify as three currents @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath68 .",
    "we solve the equations of motion in terms of these currents , and obtain the on - shell action along the lines of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we demand the square root in the action to be real all the way from the horizon , located at @xmath74 , to the boundary at infinity . as shown in appendix [ sec : rotationinvariance ] , it delivers two important relations : j^- = - j^+ , and ohm s law , @xmath75 , with @xmath76 where @xmath77 , and we use the dimensionless scaling variables @xmath78    equation ( [ conductivity ] ) is particularly interesting in the regime @xmath79 , @xmath80 ; @xmath81 therefore , the ohmic resistivity is linear in temperature in the low-@xmath82 regime of the model .     as a function of a tuning parameter @xmath83 and temperature @xmath82 at low temperatures .",
    "note that the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity extends over the low temperature range , with @xmath84 .",
    "compare this plot to fig .",
    "3 of @xcite . , scaledwidth=55.0% ]    we now focus on the first term of eq .",
    "( [ conductivity ] ) . at low temperatures ,",
    "this term dominates over the second one , namely when @xmath85 , @xmath80 .",
    "notably , the first term is due to the drag force exerted by the medium on heavier charge carriers ( drag limit ) @xcite . in this limit",
    ", the resistivity reads @xmath86 the drag mechanism here is purely stringy and is explained below in subsection [ sec : sctm ] .    by increasing the scaling variable @xmath87 , the temperature dependence of the resistivity crosses from linear @xmath88 to quadratic @xmath89 .",
    "this crossover is governed by the bulk parameter @xmath27 , setting the scale of the lifshitz symmetry .",
    "@xmath42 , on the other hand , is a more interesting parameter .",
    "its direct physical interpretation is not straightforward as it is the light - cone component of an electric field in the boost direction @xmath36 . in section [ sec : roleofeb ]",
    ", we also explain the interpretation of @xmath42 and discuss why we expect @xmath90 to correspond to the heavily overdoped region whereas @xmath91 to optimal doping .",
    "the crossover behavior observed is due to the fact that effectively the gravitational background ( [ adsinlightcone ] ) , interpolates between z=1 ( ads ) symmetry in the uv to z=2 lifshitz symmetry in the ir .",
    "we will now comment on the resistivity results discussed in the previous section .    in strongly coupled systems described holographically , the conductivity of charge carriers has typically two contributions ( that add quadratically ) , the  drag \" term and the  pair - creation \" term @xcite .",
    "the physical picture corresponding to the drag contribution is that a charged  quark \" moves through the strongly coupled ( glue ) plasma dragging behind its flux that is represented in the ( fundamental ) string .",
    "string \" should be considered as the glue field attached to the  quark \" .",
    "there is a world - volume horizon on that string , which has been interpreted to separate the part of the tail that has thermalized via interactions with the plasma and that is closer and follows the  quark \" .",
    "it is loosing energy because of the strong interactions with the plasma .",
    "a drude - like formula relates this energy loss and terminal velocity to the conductivity ( drag conductivity ) .",
    "although the drude formula is classical and its physics are well understood , the result of the energy loss at strong coupling is poorly understood . the same mechanism for qcd is more or less experimentally tested in heavy - ion collisions . however , there is no alternative theoretical understanding of the dependence of the energy loss on terminal velocity , etc .",
    ", apart from general symmetry considerations . the clear picture exists in the gravitational description : the resistance is due to the energy loss of a string moving in the appropriate gravitational background .",
    "the other contribution is expected to be due to light charged pairs created from the vacuum contributing to the conductivity .",
    "this contribution is boltzmann suppressed and controlled , in our model ( and in @xcite ) , by the coefficient @xmath92 given in equations ( [ conductivity ] ) and ( [ cond ] ) above . in full blown holographic models , this depends explicitly on the uv mass of charge carriers .",
    "notably , this contribution comes from strong coupling and no alternative calculations of this exist in the same regime for comparison .",
    "this term picks up at higher temperatures and is not relevant to the regimes discussed below .",
    "here , we are interested in the very low temperature regime to study the possible presence of quantum criticality and the associated superconducting mechanism .",
    "therefore , the model includes a bulk geometry representing critical  glue \" that crosses over from z=1 to z=2 behavior in the ir and massive charge carriers ( as probes ) moving in this background , losing energy via the  drag \" strong coupling mechanism .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 controls the physics of charge transport in analogy to experimental tuning parameters such as charge carrier doping , pressure , electric field or in - plane magnetic field .",
    "a priori , @xmath42 is a light - cone electric field component , @xmath93 . more precisely ,",
    "as detailed in appendix [ sec : rotationinvariance ] , it is a vector with two components , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "however , as shown there , we may set @xmath96 and describe the transport properties in terms of @xmath42 without loss of generality .    in the same appendix",
    "we also show that , despite the fact that the vector light - cone electric field is non - zero , transport is in fact rotationally invariant .",
    "since @xmath42 is the only non - zero electric field component and , in particular , does not break rotational invariance in the transverse @xmath37 directions , its presence demands an interpretation .",
    "such an electric field can be obtained by an infinite boost along the @xmath36 directions from a standard electric field @xmath97 in the @xmath68 direction . under a boost @xmath98 along the @xmath36 direction , @xmath99 therefore , to arrive at our set - up we need to send @xmath100 and @xmath101 so that the product is finite @xmath102 therefore , a non - zero @xmath42 reflects an infinite boost of the system in the @xmath36 direction and an infinitesimal electric field in the @xmath68 direction .",
    "this limiting procedure explains why we should not expect rotational invariance in the @xmath68-@xmath103 plane to be broken as demonstrated explicitly in appendix [ sec : rotationinvariance ] .",
    "to interpret the effect of varying @xmath42 , we will have to follow it through the passage to the infinite momentum frame .",
    "this translates into varying the `` speed of light '' @xmath104 that enters in the boost .",
    "therefore , fixing the same infinitesimal @xmath97 in the rest frame and varying the `` speed of light '' is equivalent to varying @xmath42 in the infinite momentum frame - in particular as @xmath105 , @xmath91 . in our metric",
    ", this variation is implemented by varying the ir scale @xmath27 that controls the passage between z=1 and z=2 scaling in the bulk geometry .",
    "this is also visible in all our expressions for the conductivity , in terms of the scaling variables where @xmath42 appears always in the combination @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , @xmath42 should not be thought as an external field but as an internal variable parameter of the system .    by the relativity principle",
    ", we conclude that the infinite momentum frame captures the physics of charge carriers in two regimes : + ( a ) the @xmath107 cft regime when @xmath108 .",
    "+ ( b ) the @xmath109 liftshitz - like regime when @xmath110 .",
    "the transition temperature is controlled by @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath90 maps to the large `` doping '' region where the resistivity is quadratic at all scales .",
    "this is the quadratic resistivity of cft and is not necessarily associated , as is now well known , to fermions or bosons ( in the @xmath111 example , it is both . )",
    "@xmath112 maps to optimal doping where the resistivity is linear at all scales .",
    "there are several side arguments that support this map .",
    "in parametrizing the resistivity as @xmath113 at low temperature , experiments indicate @xmath114 to be constant and @xmath115 to decrease rapidly with doping @xcite . in our model , @xmath114 is indeed independent of @xmath42 , while @xmath116 and vanishes across the `` overdoped regime '' ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the scaling variable for the magnetic field is @xmath117 and the conductivities depend on @xmath118 alone .",
    "this is in accordance with experimental observations , where as one moves to the overdoped region the effects of the magnetic field are stronger @xcite .",
    "this is discussed in more detail below .",
    "notably , in the families of strange metals one may vary the chemical potential also using an external magnetic and electric field and not necessarily chemical doping .",
    "it is not entirely clear at the moment how parameters such as the `` internal light velocity '' ( as defined by the holographic metric ) is related to standard physical properties of the material - charge density , velocity of quasiparticles , etc . to assert this , a more detailed analysis is necessary where",
    "several new constituents should be considered - for instance , the calculation of correlation functions of currents , couplings to fermions , and potentially others .",
    "this analysis maybe necessary to provide further features for this class of ideas . however , it is beyond the focus of the present effort .",

    "magnetotransport has been at the heart of studying the emerging properties of superconductors . here",
    ", we focus our discussion on characteristic quantities which have puzzled the condensed matter community and remain largely unexplained . we discuss especially the region where the concentration of charge carrier doping is sufficiently high to span the phase diagram from optimal superconductivity ( optimal doping ) towards its suppression due to excessive carrier concentration ( overdoping ) . for this",
    "we chose to address two prototypical copper oxide superconductors , namely @xmath143 ( lsco ) and @xmath144 ( tbco ) , for which it is possible to span the abovementioned doping range .",
    "the normal state of these superconductors may be accessed by suppressing superconductivity , for example , through the substitution of @xmath145 for @xmath146 ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) or by a sufficiently high applied magnetic field @xcite . for a nice review concerning anomalous transport properties of cuprates ,",
    "see _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has been generally accepted that at optimal doping i.e. , where the absolute value of the superfluid density is highest , the resistivity in the normal state of cuprate superconductors varies linearly with @xmath82 .",
    "this unconventional behavior has often been discussed in terms of quantum criticality . as charge carrier doping increases ,",
    "the linearity gives way to higher power laws and eventually a more or less fermi liquid regime emerges .",
    "however , recent low temperature transport data @xcite on lsco have challenged earlier works @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors reported that the suppressed superconducting region is replaced by a `` 2d strange metal '' , with the ohmic resistivity at low temperature behaving as @xmath84 .",
    "especially the doping region where the resistivity varies linearly with @xmath82 is broader than expected and continues to survive in the heavily overdoped side of the phase diagram .",
    "this result suggests a line of critical points and therefore a significant departure from our earlier understanding on the possible role of the above mentioned linearity and a well defined , singular quantum critical point coinciding with optimal superconductivity .",

    "this is clearly depicted in fig .",

    "we start by summarizing the main features of the transport properties described by our model .    1 .",
    "in the absence of an applied magnetic field , there is a linear resistivity near @xmath39 , which changes to quadratic at higher temperatures .",
    "the coefficient of the quadratic term is independent of @xmath42 , whereas that of the linear term is proportional to @xmath151 , which is directly related to the inverse of the doping .",
    "2 .   in the presence of a magnetic field",
    ", @xmath152 is linear when the resistivity is linear , and quadratic when the resistivity is quadratic .",
    "this is the behavior seen in strange metals at very low temperatures ( for example below 25 k in overdoped @xmath144 ) . at higher temperatures however , the quadratic behavior in real materials dominates the overdoped side .",
    "the magnetoresistance calculated is in agreement with experimental data at low temperatures .",
    "the model predicts that near @xmath39 the magnetoresistance dives sharply towards zero .",
    "the universal scaling behavior of hall coefficient , available in the experimental literature , is qualitatively very similar to the scaling function @xmath153 of our model .",
    "the  modified khler \" rule is known to be valid for cuprates and other related materials .",
    "khler s rule has been shown experimentally to fail at relatively high temperatures in the overdoped region .",
    "it has been argued that this is due to a superconducting instability @xcite .",
    "we show that it is also compatible with the correlation between @xmath152 and resistivity as observed experimentally at low temperatures .",
    "the model therefore predicts that at sufficiently low temperatures both the khler and modified khler rules are valid in the overdoped region .",
    "let us concentrate on the recent experimental observations on lsco and tbco at very low temperature .",
    "in overdoped tbco the resistivity in the millikelvin regime follows @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "recently , very low temperature resistivity data on lsco over a wide range of doping , namely from slight underdoped @xmath155 to heavily overdoped @xmath156 , indicate that the suppressed superconducting region in the overdoped regime has an unexpected @xmath157 behavior , with a particularly interesting linear temperature dependence of the resistivity at very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath114 was found to be doping independent , while @xmath115 decreased rapidly with overdoping .",
    "earlier works in the overdoped region ( above @xmath158 ) for lsco reported a novel power - law @xmath159 with @xmath160 dominating the resistivity over a wide temperature range ( see for example , fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",

    "a thorough investigation at very low temperature however , has yet to be performed .",
    "our results demonstrate that the resistivity and the inverse hall angle behave in a similar manner when the system is at low temperature and small magnetic fields , indicating that we are working in a linear regime or a weak field regime as defined by the experimental results for the magnetoresistance @xmath171 and hall coefficient @xmath172 @xcite .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : reshallang ] .",
    "the magnetoresistance is defined as follows : @xmath173 unlike overdoped tbco ( @xmath174 k ) , in optimally doped tbco ( @xmath175 k ) the weak magnetic field regime extends up to 60 t. this has implications on the doping dependence of @xmath176 .",
    "the scaling dependence of the resistivity on magnetic field , via the scaling in equation ( [ bcond ] ) is in qualitative agreement with experimental results @xcite .",

    "it has been argued that for lsco superconducting fluctuations play an important role in accounting for the difference between khler s rule and the modified khler rule @xcite . while in principle",
    "our model can be shown to exhibit a superconducting transition by coupling to gauge and scalar fields , in the current setup our system does not include superconducting fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , at very low temperatures in the overdoped regime we do not expect that two such scales exist , as suggested by the very low temperature measurements of magnetoresistance .",
    "our data for the khler ratio and the modified khler ratio are in general temperature dependent , but not in the small temperature and large temperature limits .",
    "indeed , the facts that the resistivity and the inverse hall angle are proportional at low temperatures and the modified khler ratio is constant implies that the khler ratio is also constant at very low temperatures .",
    "although this seems to be in contradiction with claims in the literature , we believe it should be valid at very low temperatures , in view of the proportionality of @xmath152 to @xmath185 @xcite .",
    "a simple holographic system , namely the ads - schwarzschild black hole in light - cone coordinates , provides a solvable quantum critical model of magnetotransport with a wide range of properties .",
    "the results obtained are in good agreement with those of strange metals , in particular the high-@xmath3 cuprates at very low temperatures with charge carrier concentration ranging from the optimal to the overdoped regime .",
    "an intriguing novel property emerging from our work is the scaling of the carrier doping dependence , hence , the model at @xmath186 should be considered as a quantum critical line albeit with a lifshitz scaling of z=2 , which presents a radical departure from the paradigm of the isolated critical point .",
    "this controls the linear resistivity in this regime as suggested in @xcite .",
    "recent experimental results also point in this direction .",
    "this regime crosses over to a quadratic one , controlled by a standard cft liquid .",

    "they are based on expectations of emergent strong non - abelian interactions at low energies and the ensuing holographic description .",

    "the emergence of superconductivity in this context is another important direction to be explored .",
