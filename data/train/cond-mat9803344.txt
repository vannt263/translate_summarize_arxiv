    "global optimization is a subject of intense current interest.@xcite improved global optimization methods could be of great economic importance , since improved solutions to travelling salesman type problems , the routing of circuitry in a chip , the active structure of a biomolecule , etc . , equate to reduced costs or improved performance . in chemical physics",
    "the interest in efficient global optimization methods stems from the common problem of finding the lowest energy configuration of a ( macro)molecular system .",
    "for example , it seems likely that the native structure of a protein is structurally related to the global minimum of its potential energy surface ( pes ) .",
    "if this global minimum could be found reliably from the primary amino acid sequence , this knowledge would provide new insight into the nature of protein folding and save biochemists many hours in the laboratory .",
    "unfortunately , this goal is far from being realized .",
    "instead the development of global optimization methods has usually concentrated on much simpler systems .",
    "lennard - jones ( lj ) clusters represent one such test system . here",
    "the potential is @xmath2,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the pair equilibrium well depth and separation , respectively .",
    "we will employ reduced units , i.e.  @xmath5 throughout .",
    "much of the initial interest in lj clusters was motivated by a desire to calculate nucleation rates for noble gases . however , as a result of the wealth of data generated , the lj potential has been used not only for studying global optimization but also the effects of finite size on phase transitions such as melting . through the combined efforts of many workers likely candidates for the global minima of lj@xmath6 clusters have been found up to @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite this represents a significant achievement since extrapolation of tsai and jordan s comprehensive enumeration of minima for small lj clusters@xcite suggests that the pes of the 147-atom cluster possesses of the order of @xmath8 minima.@xcite    previous studies have revealed that the mackay icosahedron@xcite provides the dominant structural motif for lj clusters in the size range 10150 atoms .",
    "complete icosahedra are possible at @xmath9 at most intermediate sizes the global minimum consists of a mackay icosahedron at the core covered by a low energy overlayer . as a consequence of the phase behaviour of lj clusters , finding these global minima is relatively easy .",
    "studies have shown that in the region of the solid - liquid transition the cluster is observed to change back and forth between a liquid - like form and icosahedral structures.@xcite as a result of this ` dynamic coexistence ' a method as crude as molecular dynamics within the melting region coupled with systematic minimization of configurations generated by the trajectory is often sufficient to locate the global minimum.@xcite    -0.2 cm -0.2 cm    however , there are a number of sizes at which the global minimum is not based on an icosahedral structure .",
    "these clusters are illustrated in figure [ fig : nonicos ] .",
    "for the lowest energy structure is a face - centred - cubic ( fcc ) truncated octahedron,@xcite and for @xmath10 , 76 , 77 , 102 , 103 and 104 geometries based on marks decahedra@xcite are lowest in energy.@xcite for these cases finding the lowest minimum is much harder because the global minimum of free energy only becomes associated with the global potential energy minimum at temperatures well below melting where the dynamics of structural relaxation are very slow . for , the microcanonical temperature for the transition from face - centred cubic to icosahedral structures has been estimated to be about 0.12@xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant , and for the estimate for the decahedral to icosahedral transition is about 0.09@xmath11.@xcite ( for comparison , melting typically occurs at about @xmath13 . )    the topography of the pes can also play a key role in determining the ease of global optimization@xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the pes has shown that there is a large energy barrier between the fcc and icosahedral structures@xcite which correspond to well - separated regions of the pes .",
    "furthermore , fcc and decahedral structures have less polytetrahedral character than icosahedral structures , and hence they have less in common with the liquid - like state , which is characterized by disordered polytetrahedral packing.@xcite since the vast majority of configuration space is dominated by ` liquid - like ' configurations , it is therefore harder to find global minima based upon fcc and decahedral packing using unbiased searches .",
    "these considerations explain why global optimization methods have only recently begun to find the truncated octahedron@xcite and why , until now , the marks decahedron has never been found by an unbiased global optimization method .",
    "the greater difficulty of finding the global minimum compared to can probably be explained by the slightly smaller transition temperature , the sharper transition and the much larger number of minima on the pes .    before we consider the effectiveness of different global optimization methods for lennard - jones clusters it is interesting to note that the use of physical principles to construct good candidate structures for the global minima@xcite or to reduce the configuration space that needs to be searched@xcite led to the initial discovery of 93% of the lj global minima in this size range .",
    "it seems that physical insight into a specific problem will often be able to beat unbiased global optimization , a view expressed by ngo @xcite in their discussion of computational complexity .",
    "one difficulty in evaluating the relative performances of different global optimization methods is that , too often , the methods have only been applied to small clusters , or to larger clusters with global minima that are especially stable , such as .",
    "it is also difficult to draw any firm conclusions about how efficient different methods may be when the number of searches employed varies widely .",
    "however , it seems reasonable to suggest two hurdles that any putative global optimization approach should aspire to .",
    "the first is the location of the truncated octahedron for , and any method which fails this test is unlikely to be useful .",
    "the second hurdle is the location of the marks decahedron for ; this problem poses a much more severe test for an unbiased search and one which does not appear to have been passed until the present work .",
    "the most successful global optimization results for lj clusters reported to date are for genetic algorithms.@xcite these methods mimic some aspects of biological evolution : a population of clusters evolves to low energy by mutation and mating of structures , and selection of those with low potential energy . to be successful new configurations produced by ` genetic manipulation ' are mapped onto minima by a local optimization algorithm such as the conjugate gradient method .",
    "the study by deaven  is particularly impressive , since these workers matched or beat all the lowest energy minima that they knew of up to @xmath14 , including the truncated octahedron ( although they probably missed the global minima at @xmath15=69 and 7578 ) .",
    "niesse and mayne were also able to locate the truncated octahedron , and report that this structure took about 25 times longer to find than the icosahedral global minima of the neighbouring sizes .",
    "another class of global optimization techniques , sometimes called hypersurface deformation methods , attempts to simplify the problem by applying a transformation to the pes which smoothes it and reduces the number of local minima.@xcite the global minimum of the deformed pes is then mapped back to the original surface in the _ hope _ that this will lead back to the global minimum of the original pes .",
    "the distinctions between the various methods of this type lie in the type of transformations that are used , which include applying the diffusion equation,@xcite increasing the range of the potential,@xcite and shifting the position of the potential minimum towards the origin.@xcite the performance of hypersurface deformation methods has been variable : the potential shift approach managed to find the 38-atom truncated octahedron , but other workers report difficulties@xcite for the trivial cases of and where there are only 8 and 21 minima on the pes , respectively .",
    "although intuitively appealing , the problem with hypersurface deformation is that there is no guarantee that the global minimum on the deformed pes will map onto the global minimum of the original surface .",
    "this difficulty is clearly illustrated when we consider stillinger and stillinger s suggestion of increasing the range of the potential:@xcite it has been shown that the global minimum may in fact depend rather sensitively on the range of the potential , with the appearance of numerous ` range - induced ' transitions.@xcite    other methods include those based on ` annealing ' .",
    "such approaches take advantage of the simplification in the free energy landscape that occurs at high temperatures , and attempt to follow the free energy global minimum as the temperature is decreased . at zero kelvin",
    "the free energy global minimum and the global minimum of the pes must coincide .",
    "standard simulated annealing@xcite was used by wille to find a few new minima at small sizes@xcite but does not appear to have been systematically applied to lj clusters .",
    "more sophisticated variants of this technique include gaussian density annealing and analogues,@xcite but again some appear to fail at small sizes.@xcite    the difficulty with the annealing approach methods is that , if the free energy global minimum changes at low temperatures where dynamical relaxation is slow , the algorithms will become stuck in the structure corresponding to the high temperature free energy global minimum . such methods are therefore likely to experience difficulties in finding the global minima for and . in the language employed in recent protein folding literature,@xcite annealing will fail when @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the ` folding ' temperature below which the global potential energy and free energy minima coincide , and @xmath18 is the ` glass ' temperature at which the system effectively becomes trapped in a local minimum .    another method which attempts to reduce the effects of barriers on the pes makes use of quantum tunnelling .",
    "the diffusion monte carlo approach is used to find the ground state wavefunction , which should become localized at the global minimum as @xmath19 is decreased to zero.@xcite a more rigorous approach has been applied by maranas and floudas , who found upper and lower bounds for the energy of the global minimum .",
    "however , the computational expense of this method , which scales as @xmath20 with the number of atoms , means that it has only been used for small systems.@xcite most of the above studies , along with the recently described ` pivot method'@xcite and ` taboo search',@xcite have yet to prove their usefulness by passing the first hurdle for suggested above .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that these approaches should be discounted , since some authors have only applied their algorithms to smaller clusters and may not have run enough searches to achieve convergence .",
    "in the present work we present the results of a basin - hopping global optimization technique for lennard - jones clusters . all the known lowest energy structures up to @xmath21 have been located successfully , including three minima not previously reported .",
    "( see tables 1 and 2 . )",
    "this method is also the first unbiased algorithm to find the global minima based on the marks decahedron around  and . for reference",
    ", we collect the rather scattered results previously reported for lj clusters to provide a complete catalogue of the energies and point groups of the lowest energy minima that we know of .",
    "the results have been collected in the first entry of the cambridge cluster database at http://brian.ch.cam.ac.uk .",
    "the present approach has been guided by previous work on energy landscapes which has identified features that enable the system to locate its global minimum efficiently.@xcite in particular , analysis of model energy landscapes using a master equation approach for the dynamics , has provided good evidence that such a surface should have a large potential energy gradient and the lowest possible transition state energies or rearrangement barriers.@xcite these results immediately suggest a simple way to transform the pes which does not change the global minimum , nor the relative energies of any local minima .",
    "we consider the transformed energy @xmath22 defined by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 represents the @xmath25-dimensional vector of nuclear coordinates and @xmath26 signifies that an energy minimization is performed starting from @xmath24 . in the present work energy minimizations",
    "were performed using the polak - ribiere variant of the conjugate gradient algorithm.@xcite hence the energy at any point in configuration space is assigned to that of the local minimum obtained by the given geometry optimization technique , and the pes is mapped onto a set of interpenetrating staircases with plateaus corresponding to the set of configurations which lead to a given minimum after optimization",
    ". a schematic view of the staircase topography that results from this transformation is given in figure [ fig : trans ] .",
    "these plateaus , or basins of attraction , have been visualized in previous work as a means to compare the efficiency of different transition state searching techniques.@xcite    0.2 cm",
    "-0.2 cm    the energy landscape for the function @xmath27 was explored using a canonical monte carlo simulation at a _ constant _ reduced temperature of @xmath28 . at each step",
    "all coordinates were displaced by a random number in the range @xmath29 $ ] times the step size , which was adjusted to give an acceptance ratio of @xmath30 .",
    "the nature of the transformed surface allowed relatively large step sizes of between @xmath31@xmath32 . for each cluster in the range considered seven separate runs were conducted .",
    "five of these each consisted of 5000 monte carlo steps starting from different randomly generated configurations of atoms confined to a sphere of radius @xmath33 reduced units .",
    "the subsequent geometry optimizations employed a container of radius one plus the value required to contain the same volume per atom as the fcc primitive cell .",
    "the container should have little effect on any of our results and is only required to prevent dissociation during the conjugate gradient optimizations .",
    "the convergence criterion employed for the conjugate gradient optimizations used in the monte carlo moves need not be very tight . in the present work we required the root - mean - square ( rms ) gradient to fall below @xmath34 in reduced units and the energy to change by less than @xmath35 between consecutive steps in the conjugate gradient search .",
    "initially it appeared that a tolerance of @xmath36 for the rms gradient was satisfactory , but this was subsequently found to cause problems for clusters containing more than about 60 atoms .",
    "the lowest energy structures obtained during the canonical simulation were saved and reoptimized with tolerances of @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the rms force and the energy difference , respectively .",
    "the final energies are accurate to about six decimal places .",
    "several other techniques were employed in these calculations , namely seeding , freezing and angular moves .",
    "here we used the pair energy per atom , @xmath39 , defined as @xmath40,\\ ] ] so that the total energy is @xmath41 if the highest pair energy rose above a fraction @xmath42 of the lowest pair energy then an angular move was employed for the atom in question with all other atoms fixed .",
    "@xmath42 was adjusted to give an acceptance ratio for angular moves of @xmath30 and generally converged to between @xmath32 and @xmath43 . each angular displacement consisted of choosing random @xmath44 and @xmath45 spherical polar coordinates for the atom in question , taking the origin at the centre of mass and replacing the radius with the maximum value in the cluster .",
    "the two remaining runs for each size consisted of only 200 monte carlo steps starting from the global minima obtained for the clusters containing one more and one less atom . when starting from @xmath46 the @xmath47 atoms",
    "were frozen for the first 100 steps , during which only angular moves were attempted for the remaining atom , starting from a random position outside the core . when starting from @xmath48 the atom with the highest pair energy , @xmath39 , was removed and 200 unrestricted monte carlo moves were attempted from the resulting geometry .",
    "the above basin - hopping algorithm shares a common philosophy with our previous approach in which steps were taken directly between minima using eigenvector - following to calculate pathways.@xcite the latter method is similar to that described recently by barkema and mousseau@xcite in their search for well - relaxed configurations in glasses .",
    "although the computational expense of transition state searches probably makes this method uncompetitive for global optimization , our study illustrated the possible advantage of working in a space in which only the minima are present .",
    "the basin - hopping algorithm differs in that it is applied in configuration space to a transformed surface , rather than in a discrete space of minima , and steps are taken stochastically .",
    "the genetic algorithms described by deaven @xcite and niesse and mayne@xcite used conjugate gradient minimization to refine the local minima which comprise the population of structures that are evolved in their procedure . hence these authors are in effect studying the same transformed surface as described above , but explore it in a rather different manner .",
    "we suspect that the success of their methods is at least partly due to the implicit use of the transformed surface @xmath22 .",
    "the transformation of the pes also reduces the barriers to dissociation .",
    "therefore , to prevent evaporation either the cluster can be by placed in a tight - fitting container or the coordinates of the current point in configuration space can be reset to that of the minimum after each successful step . in this paper",
    "we used the latter method and then the present approach is essentially the same as the monte carlo - minimization algorithm of li and scheraga,@xcite who applied it to search the conformational space of the pentapeptide [ met@xmath49enkephalin .",
    "a similar method has recently been used by baysal and meirovitch@xcite to search the conformational space of cyclic polypeptides .",
    "-0.3 cm    -0.3 cm",
    "the basin - hopping algorithm has successfully located all the lowest known minima up to , including all the non - icosahedral structures illustrated in figure [ fig : trans ] ( sizes 38 , 75 , 76 , 77 , 102 , 103 and 104 ) and three new geometries based upon icosahedra illustrated in figure [ fig : new ] ( sizes 69 , 78 and 107 ) .",
    "we believe that this is the first time any of the six decahedral global minima have been located by an unbiased algorithm .",
    "the total number of searches was fixed in our calculations to provide a simple reference criterion .",
    "in fact , most of the global minima were found in more than one of the separate monte carlo runs .",
    "the global minima for the smallest clusters were located within a few steps in each of the seven runs . to give a better idea of how the algorithm performed we will provide some more details for the sizes with non - icosahedral or newly discovered icosahedral global minima .    for the truncated octahedron was found in four out of five of",
    "the longer unseeded runs ; the first success occurred within a thousand monte carlo steps on average .",
    "not surprisingly , the global minimum was not located in the shorter runs starting from the structurally unrelated global minima for @xmath50 and 39 .    for the global minimum",
    "was found in just one of the longer monte carlo runs , and again in the short run from the global minimum for .",
    "however , the latter minimum was only found in the short runs seeded from the and decahedra .",
    "similarly , the global minimum was only found in the short run seeded from the decahedron .",
    "the decahedral global minimum for was found in four out of 100 monte carlo runs of 5000 steps each , a frequency which fits in quite well with our results for , and .",
    "a successful run requires an initial geometry which falls within the decahedral catchment area ; all the other runs produce the lowest icosahedral minimum after which the decahedron is never found",
    ". it would obviously be possible to locate global minima based upon decahedra more efficiently by biasing the starting configuration , but our intention was to analyze the performance of an unbiased algorithm in the present work .",

    "has energy @xmath51 .",
    "this structure was not found in 100 mc runs of 10000 steps each ; instead the lowest minimum located had an energy of @xmath52 .",
    "for  the truncated octahedron has energy @xmath53 . however , we located a structure of energy @xmath54 which is based upon icosahedral packing .",
    "this minimum was found in three out of 50 mc runs of 10000 steps each .",
    "for these larger systems greater efficiency could probably be achieved by varying the temperature and other parameters of the mc search .",
    "we have presented the results of a basin - hopping or monte carlo - minimization@xcite approach to global optimization for atomic clusters bound by the lennard - jones potential containing up to 110 atoms .",
    "all the lowest known minima were located successfully , including the seven structures based upon fcc or decahedral packing and three new global minima based upon icosahedra . of the latter ten structures , only the smallest has been located before by an unbiased algorithm , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the method is based upon a hypersurface deformation in which the potential energy surface ( pes ) is converted into a set of plateaus each corresponding to a basin of attraction of a local minimum on the original pes .",
    "this process removes all the transition state regions but does not affect the energies of the minima . on the original pes , most trajectories that approach the boundary between two basins of attraction are reflected back due to the high potential energy ; only if the trajectory is along a transition state valley does passage between basins become likely . in contrast , on the transformed pes it is feasible for the system to hop between basins at any point along the basin boundary which dramatically reduces the time scale for interbasin motion .",
    "we speculate that the success of a previous genetic algorithm applied to the same clusters may be at least partly due to the fact that the same space is implicitly considered in that approach.@xcite    the efficiency of the present approach could doubtless be improved by combining it with various other techniques .",
    "the most obvious short - cut would be to start not from initial random configurations but from seeds with either decahedral , icosahedral or fcc morphologies .",
    "we have already checked that such biasing is indeed effective , but our aim in the present paper was to gauge the performance of the unbiased algorithm .",
    "the temperature at which our monte carlo runs were conducted was also not optimized systematically .",
    "finally , as we noted in the introduction , global optimization for lennard - jones clusters at most sizes is a relatively easy task .",
    "a more stringent and general test is provided by morse clusters which exhibit different structural behaviour as a function of the range of the potential.@xcite at short range the task is particularly difficult because the pes is very rugged  the number of minima@xcite and the barrier heights@xcite increase as the range is decreased .",
