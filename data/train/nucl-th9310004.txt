    "spectroscopic factors and occupation probabilities are basic elements for our understanding of the nuclear structure , measuring the accuracy of the shell model description .",
    "the fundamental concept on which the shell model is based , the mean field approximation , is considered as the leading contribution in an expansion of multiparticle correlations within the general framework of the nuclear many - body theory .",
    "these correlations allow the nucleons to occupy partially different orbits above and below the fermi level .",
    "therefore , the deviation from full occupancy of the orbits below the fermi level is a measure of the correlations neglected in the mean field approach , or in other words , a check of the validity of the mean field description .",
    "the spectroscopic factor @xmath4 is defined as the probability to reach a final single particle ( hole ) state @xmath5 when a nucleon is added to ( removed from ) the target nucleus .",
    "the occupation number @xmath6 is the number of nucleons in the quantum state @xmath5 in the target nucleus , relative to the @xmath7 limit .",
    "theoretical spectroscopic factors and occupation numbers have been derived for some doubly magic nuclei , taking into account both short- and long - range correlations . in particular ,",
    "occupation numbers for the @xmath8 state in @xmath1pb have been obtained from different approaches .",
    "mahaux and sartor @xcite derived an occupation number @xmath9 and a spectroscopic factor @xmath10 by using a dispersion relation approach , which allows to extrapolate the empirical mean field from positive energies ( optical potential ) to negative energies ( shell model potential ) .",
    "slightly smaller spectroscopic factors have been obtained by ma and wambach @xcite using a quasiparticle hamiltonian which includes correlations in a phenomenological way .",
    "pandharipande and collaborators @xcite obtained an average value @xmath11 for the occupation probabilities of single - particle states just below the fermi level , using a variational calculation of nuclear matter to which a random phase approximation correction is added .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", relative spectroscopic factors have been historically determined by single - nucleon transfer reactions . in a search for absolute empirical values of spectroscopic factors ,",
    "additional experimental information has been recently collected from two new sources .",
    "one is based on a sum rule analysis @xcite of both transfer data and charge density differences of isotones extracted from @xmath12 reactions .",
    "this method allows to go from relative spectroscopic factors to an absolute occupation number ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "a typical value for the occupation number of the @xmath8 shell in @xmath1pb obtained from this method is @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the other method is the quasielastic @xmath14 reaction , which constitutes indeed a very well suited tool to extract experimental information on absolute spectroscopic factors .",
    "modern facilities allow to study this reaction in detail and high precision measurements of cross sections are available @xcite .",
    "the small strength of the electromagnetic interaction allows one to study the transition in born approximation ( ba ) by the exchange of a single virtual photon . choosing properly the momentum and energy transferred by the virtual photon in order to satisfy the quasielastic condition @xmath15 , the process can be treated with confidence @xcite in impulse approximation ( ia ) , i.e. , assuming that the exchanged photon is absorbed by a single nucleon which is the one detected . under these circumstances",
    ", it is possible to extract information on the energy and momentum distribution of the bound nucleon .",
    "although the advantages of the @xmath14 process over other possible reactions to study spectroscopic factors are widely recognized , the extraction of these factors from experiment is still not free of ambiguities . a reliable determination of spectroscopic factors requires an accurate knowledge of the mechanism of the reaction and , in this context , the exact treatment of the coulomb distortion of the electrons is important , especially in heavy nuclei such as lead .",
    "different methods have been proposed to handle the distortion .",
    "the early approaches were based on the eikonal approximation @xcite within a nonrelativistic scenario for the nuclear part .",
    "this method was applied to the analysis of @xmath14 data taken at nikhef - k @xcite , producing surprisingly low spectroscopic factors ( @xmath16 for the @xmath8 shell in @xmath1pb ) , incompatible with results obtained from other reactions as well as with theoretical predictions .",
    "this fact , together with the large difference between the results from first and second order eikonal calculations , raised the question of whether this approximation was adequate to treat the coulomb distortion or a more involved analysis was still needed .    the first realistic calculations with a more exact treatment of the coulomb distortion in ( @xmath2 )",
    "were made in 1990 by mcdermott @xcite .",
    "the incorporation of the distortion effects was achieved by means of a full partial wave analysis of the electron waves in the coulomb potential of the target , as well as of the outgoing proton waves distorted by the optical potential .",
    "the complexity of the numerical calculations required a full relativistic framework , not only for the electron vertex where the energies involved in the experiments ( hundreds of mev ) make it mandatory , but also for the nuclear vertex .",
    "nevertheless , some approximations were still made ( helicity conserved approximation , hca ) to simplify the treatment of the electron coulomb distorted waves .",
    "the spectroscopic factor for the @xmath8 shell in @xmath1pb amounts in this approximation to @xmath17 @xcite , manifestly above the value obtained within the eikonal approximation .",
    "subsequently , a new relativistic calculation was reported by jin _",
    "@xcite , where the treatment of the coulomb distortion of the electrons was exact and the above mentioned restricted approximation ( hca ) was not made .",
    "the result of this calculation @xcite for the spectroscopic factor in the same shell is @xmath18 , which is larger than the result of ref .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite reported also some discrepancies with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in the limit of plane waves for the electron ( no coulomb distortion ) and stressed the need for further investigation .",
    "this paper is an attempt to clarify this situation by an independent analysis including the development of a new code @xcite , which treats the coulomb distortion of the electron in an exact way and uses a relativistic formalism for both the leptonic and the nuclear vertices .",

    ", it is worth clarifying the situation with regards to the disagreement between the pwba results in refs . @xcite and @xcite . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , both calculations being the same in pwba should lead to the same results .",
    "we found that the reason for the disagreement is due to the fact that different wave functions were used for the bound proton . in our calculations",
    "we used the code by horowitz and serot ( timora ) with the standard set of initial conditions and obtained a result ( see dashed line in fig .",
    "2a ) in agreement with that in ref . @xcite . with the same code but changing the initial conditions to those used by mcdermott @xcite , we find a result ( see dotted line in fig .",
    "2a ) that agrees with the result in ref .",
    "as indicated in the figure , the two above mentioned results have been obtained with the operator @xmath57 , which is the operator always used in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in what follows we use always for the bound proton the wave function obtained with the standard set of initial conditions .",
    "this wave function corresponds to a binding energy of 5.7 mev .    in fig .",

    "as seen in this figure the pwba results obtained with @xmath56 ( solid ) and @xmath57 ( dashed ) current operators are very close .",
    "the main difference seen at the peaks is less than 8@xmath85 , the @xmath56 result being larger .    in fig .",

    "one can see that our results ( solid line ) and those from ref .",
    "@xcite ( dashed line ) are similar and show up the same qualitative changes with respect to the corresponding pwba results shown in fig",
    "these changes are : _",
    "i ) _ a shift in @xmath86 , _ ii ) _ an increase at the maxima , and _",
    "iii ) _ a filling of the minimum at @xmath87 mev .",
    "note that the result obtained within hca ( dotted line in fig .",
    "2b ) is not able to reproduce the two last mentioned effects ( focussing effects ) but it reproduces adequately the shift in @xmath86 .    in fig .",
    "3a we show in more detail the comparison between our pwba and dwba results shown by the dotted and solid lines , respectively . also shown in fig .",
    "3a is the pwba result with an effective @xmath69-value ( dashed line ) , @xmath88 , where the electron initial and final effective momenta are given by @xmath89 with @xmath90 fm and @xmath91 .",
    "this @xmath92 value has been adjusted to get the same coulomb potential at the origin that corresponds to the charge distribution of the nuclear target obtained from the relativistic calculation , which agrees with the experimental one @xcite .",
    "this value is somewhat smaller than the value @xmath93 , corresponding to a spherical uniform charge distribution . in parallel kinematics ,",
    "since @xmath94 is varied by varying @xmath69 , a displacement in @xmath69 produces a displacement in @xmath86 . as seen in fig .",
    "3a , with this @xmath92 value the shift in @xmath86 caused by electron coulomb distortion is well accounted for .",
    "it should be pointed out that the effect of coulomb distortion shows up differently in perpendicular kinematics ( constant @xmath69 and @xmath95 ) . to illustrate this point we show in fig . 3b the comparison between our results in pwba and dwba in perpendicular kinematics . in this case",
    "there is no observable effect of displacement with @xmath86 but there is a reduction of the cross - section in dwba at @xmath96 that , as seen in the figure , is accounted for replacing @xmath69 by @xmath97 in pwba .",
    "the reduction is due to the fact that the maximum of the bound nucleon wave function ( @xmath98-wave ) at @xmath99 is not reached when @xmath69 is replaced by @xmath97 .",
    "the actual effect of the focussing is of the same order in perpendicular kinematics than in parallel kinematics . on the other hand changing @xmath69 into @xmath97 produces quite a different effect in perpendicular kinematics because in this case @xmath86 is varied keeping @xmath69 constant and varying the angle between @xmath63 and @xmath100 . in what follows only the case of parallel kinematics",
    "is considered .",
    "the focussing effects , causing the filling of the minimum and increase of the maxima in fig .",
    "3a , are summarized in a quantitative way in table i. in this table we quote the ratios between the reduced cross - sections calculated in dwba and in pwba at the two maxima .",
    "we compare the ratios obtained in this work with the ratios deduced from other relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations previously reported . the nonrelativistic results in table i correspond to the code dweepy @xcite .",
    "this code treats the coulomb distortion in an approximate way making use of an expansion in powers of @xmath101 to first order ( dweepy1 ) or to second order ( dweepy2 ) .",
    "dweepy2 is the most commonly used approximation in the nonrelativistic analyses of the data .",
    "one can see in table i that our results and those of ref .",
    "@xcite , which also treat coulomb distortion in an exact way , are in very good agreement .",
    "the results obtained with the hca code of mcdermott @xcite do not reproduce adequately the focussing effect at the peaks . among the nonrelativistic calculations ,",
    "dweepy1 overestimates largely the effect of focussing and dweepy2 gives still an overestimation .",
    "the spectroscopic factors are very sensitive to focussing effects because these factors are derived by scaling the theoretical reduced cross - section to the experimental one .",
    "as seen in table i the various approaches to treat the electron coulomb distortion fail to account for the focussing effect obtained with the exact dwba calculation , which is non - negligible in @xmath1pb",
    ". therefore , dwba calculations are necessary to deduce reliable spectroscopic factors in heavy nuclei such as lead .    in comparing relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations , it is also important to know how different approximations for the proton wave functions affect the reduced cross - section . to this end",
    "we compare in fig .",
    "4 the results of relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations in pwba because in this case there is no effect from electron coulomb distortion and the differences come only from the various approximations at the nuclear vertex .    in fig .",
    "4 the dotted and dashed lines show the pwia results of the nonrelativistic and relativistic calculations , respectively .",
    "the solid and short - dashed lines show the results in dwia of relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations . for the relativistic calculations we use the nuclear current operator @xmath102 in eq .",
    "( [ cc2 ] ) and the standard timora solution @xcite for the relativistic bound proton wave function . for the nonrelativistic",
    "bound proton wave function we use the upper component of the relativistic one , properly normalized , in the standard nonrelativistic form of the nucleon current , based on @xmath57 @xcite .",

    "the relativistic optical potential used here was determined @xcite from a global fit to elastic proton scattering data from spherical nuclei with mass numbers @xmath103 a @xmath104208 in a wide range of projectile energies from 65 mev to 1040 mev .    as seen in fig .",
    "4 , both relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations give practically the same result in pwia .",
    "the same is true when a woods - saxon potential is used for the bound nucleon @xcite .",
    "this means that the use of nonrelativistic bound nucleon wave functions does not produce a significant change in the @xmath86 range considered .",
    "the differences between relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations are much more noticeable in dwia . as seen in fig .",
    "4 , the shape is similar in both dwia calculations but the relativistic potential leads to stronger absorption than the nonrelativistic one ( about a 20@xmath85 difference at the peaks ) .",
    "this is at first sight surprising since both potentials reproduce well the elastic scattering of protons from this nucleus at proton energies of about 100 mev .",
    "therefore , the difference seen between the dwia results in fig .",
    "4 must be attributed to details of the optical potential to which the elastic proton scattering at this energy is not sensitive .",
    "as it is well known @xcite the relativistic s - v potential gives rise to non - local terms in the nonrelativistic reduction .",
    "the effect of these terms in the ( @xmath2 ) reaction was investigated by boffi and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that these terms only affect the inelastic processes , where the nuclear interior is important , producing about a 15@xmath85 increase of the absorption due to final state interactions in the ( @xmath2 ) reaction .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with the increased absorption observed in fig . 4 in going from the nonrelativistic dwia to the relativistic dwia",
    ". it would be interesting to see to what extent the nonrelativistic reduction of the s - v optical potential @xcite may lead to a similar absorption as the relativistic dwia .",

    "to have a measure for the quality of the fit , we consider the parameter @xmath105 defined as the @xmath106-value divided by the degrees of freedom ( number of data involved minus one ) in the determination of the spectroscopic factor . in our cases @xmath107 corresponds to a good quality of the fit while @xmath108 corresponds to a poor fit .",
    "the @xmath105-values obtained for @xmath1pb are @xmath107 for both shells ( @xmath109 ) and for both types of current operators . our results in fig .",
    "5a correspond to the calculations with the @xmath56 operator , using the spectroscopic factors in column three of table ii .",
    "similar results are obtained using the @xmath57 operator and the spectroscopic factors of column four in table ii .    in the case of @xmath0ca",
    "the focussing effect is negligible and the only noticeable effect of electron coulomb distortion is a shift in @xmath86 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "5b for the @xmath20 orbital where we plot the dwba result ( solid line ) and the result in pwba with @xmath97 ( dotted line ) , both using the @xmath56 operator and the same spectroscopic factor ( @xmath110 , see table ii ) .",
    "the effective momentum corresponds to @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ shift ] ) .",
    "as seen in the figure there is no significant difference between the results in dwba and in pwba with @xmath97 .",
    "although not shown in the figure , the same is true with regards to dwba and pwba calculations for the @xmath21 orbital in @xmath0ca .    as seen in fig .",
    "5b the agreement between our theoretical results for the @xmath20 and for the @xmath21 shells in @xmath0ca with the @xmath56 current operator is not as good as that obtained for the shells in @xmath1pb .",
    "if we use instead the @xmath57 operator , the agreement is not improved for the @xmath20 shell , but it improves considerably for the @xmath21 shell .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "5b where we show our results for the @xmath21 shell with the @xmath56 and the @xmath57 operators by solid and dashed lines respectively .",
    "for the case of the @xmath20 shell the @xmath105 value is larger than 7 in all cases , showing the poor quality of the fit . for the @xmath21 shell",
    "the @xmath105 value is almost 5 in the case of the @xmath56 operator and is less than 2 in the case of the @xmath57 operator .",
    "it is important to realize that all the cases where our spectroscopic factors in columns three and four of table ii are low correspond to situations in which the shape of the theoretical curve does not match well the trend in the experimental data and the @xmath105 values are large , i.e. , the fits are poor .",
    "this is particularly the case for the @xmath20 shell in @xmath0ca , where our spectroscopic factor is as low as that obtained in the nonrelativistic analysis of ref .",
    "for the shell @xmath21 in @xmath0ca , where the fit with the @xmath57 operator is very good , we get a spectroscopic factor @xmath111 , similar to that found in @xmath1pb , and larger than the one obtained in the nonrelativistic analysis @xcite .    in the case of @xmath0ca the comparison of our results with those of ref .",
    "@xcite is not as meaningful as in the case of @xmath1pb for the two following reasons : _",
    "i ) _ the bound nucleon wave functions used in ref .",
    "@xcite were different @xcite than the standard timora solutions used here , and _",
    "ii ) _ the spectroscopic factors in ref .",
    "@xcite were derived by visual fitting .",
    "however it is interesting to see that the result of jin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite agrees with the one we obtain for the @xmath21 shell with the @xmath57 operator , where we consider our deduced spectroscopic factor to be reliable .",
    "we have analyzed the quasielastic @xmath14 reaction within a fully relativistic formalism treating the coulomb distortion of the electrons in an exact way .",
    "this analysis is expected to yield more reliable spectroscopic factors than previous analyses where the electron coulomb distortion was not fully taken into account @xcite .",
    "we present results for reduced cross - sections as functions of the missing momentum ( @xmath86 ) , corresponding to proton knock - out from the outermost shells in @xmath0ca and in @xmath1pb .",
    "we study the effects purely due to electron coulomb distortion as well as the effects due to the relativistic treatment of the initial ( bound ) and final ( distorted ) nucleon wave functions .",
    "we also study the effects of using different nucleon current operators .    in parallel kinematics ,",
    "coulomb distortion produces two effects : _",
    "i ) _ displacement of the cross - section towards higher @xmath86 values that can be simulated by the use of an effective momentum transfer @xmath97 in pwba and _ ii ) _ focussing that shows up mainly in the maxima and minima of the reduced cross - section .",
    "the focussing effect plays an important role in the determination of the spectroscopic factors in @xmath1pb . in @xmath0ca",
    "the focussing effect is much smaller than in @xmath1pb and has no influence in the extraction of spectroscopic factors , but the displacement effect is still sizeable .",
    "exact dwba calculations are worthwhile even in medium nuclei like @xmath0ca in order to determine the precise magnitude of this displacement and to avoid introducing additional parameters .",
    "we find that the main difference between the results obtained with our relativistic treatment of the nuclear vertex and with the usual nonrelativistic treatment @xcite is due to the fact that the relativistic optical potential @xcite produces more absorption in the ( @xmath2 ) reaction .",
    "this gives rise to higher spectroscopic factors in much better agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "in our view this is a strong point in favour of the relativistic s - v models that are able to account for both elastic proton - nucleus and ( @xmath2 ) data simultaneously and confirms the fact that the relativistic phenomenology is in general superior to the usual nonrelativistic phenomenology in covering a large variety of experimental information on proton - nucleus scattering and particularly in what concerns spin rotation functions ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we also find that the off - shell electron - proton cross - section is less sensitive to the choice of the nucleon current operators when using free dirac spinors @xcite than when using bound dirac spinors .",
    "thus , one should be cautious when estimating the uncertainty associated to the current operator from results based only on free spinors .",
    "actually , further work is needed to clarify the situation with regards to the best choice of the nucleon current operator in the fully relativistic treatment of the ( @xmath2 ) reaction .",
    "the spectroscopic factors have been obtained by scaling to experimental data the calculated reduced cross - sections without introducing any free parameter . for the @xmath8 and @xmath19 shells in @xmath1pb we find spectroscopic factors between 0.65 and 0.73 depending on the shell and on the nucleon current operator .",
    "high quality fits to the experimental reduced cross - sections are obtained in all the cases .",
    "these spectroscopic factors are in agreement with theoretical predictions and with the results obtained for the @xmath8 shell in @xmath1pb by jin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite from a fully relativistic analysis analogous to the one carried out here .",
    "they are considerably larger than the spectroscopic factors obtained from the nonrelativistic analyses @xcite .    for @xmath0ca",
    "we only obtain a high quality fit to the data for the @xmath21 shell when using the @xmath57 operator . in this case",
    "the value of the extracted spectroscopic factor is 0.76 , similar to those obtained in @xmath1pb . for the @xmath20 shell",
    "the quality of the fit is very poor with both @xmath56 and @xmath57 operators and , therefore , we can not consider the deduced spectroscopic factors as being reliable .",
    "in our view , if the shape of the cross - section is not well reproduced , the derived spectroscopic factor is not meaningful . for this particular",
    "orbital the wave function obtained from the timora code used here does not reproduce the experimentally observed shape of the reduced cross - section . in comparing with the results by jin _",
    "@xcite for these two orbitals in @xmath0ca , one should keep in mind that there are two main differences between their calculations and ours ; _ i ) _ the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite were obtained using a phenomenological potential fitted to reproduce single - particle properties in @xmath0ca @xcite ; _ ii ) _ their spectroscopic factors are obtained by visual fit and no quality of the fit is reported to compare with ours .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of the shell @xmath21 with the @xmath57 operator , where the quality of our fit is good , our spectroscopic factor agrees with that of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work we made no attempt to fit to experiment the r.m.s .",
    "radii and binding energies of the orbitals .",
    "thus , the fact that we get high quality fits for all the orbitals studied , except the @xmath20 in @xmath0ca , can be considered as a success of the relativistic analysis .",
    "it would be interesting to explore whether more elaborated relativistic s - v models , including non linear terms , may produce results in better agreement with experimental data on reduced cross - sections for the @xmath20 shell in @xmath0ca .",
    "we are grateful to j. mcdermott for providing us with his hca code and for useful discussions and to l. lapiks and g. van der steenhoven for communication of experimental data collected at nikhef - k .",
