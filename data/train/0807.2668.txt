    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be finite - dimensional complex hilbert spaces , and let @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the sets of linear operators acting on these spaces . by a _ super - operator _",
    "one means a linear mapping of the form @xmath4 such a super - operator is said to be _",
    "admissible _ if and only if it is both completely positive and preserves trace . in the usual ( schrdinger ) picture of quantum information ,",
    "the admissible super - operators represent valid physical operations , transforming a system having associated space @xmath0 to one with associated space @xmath1 . for this reason ,",
    "admissible super - operators are also commonly referred to as _",
    "channels_.    a super - operator @xmath5 is said to be _ unital _ if it is the case that @xmath6 , for @xmath7 and @xmath8 denoting the identity operators on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "super - operators that are both unital and admissible are said to be _",
    "doubly stochastic_. the existence of a doubly - stochastic channel of the form obviously requires that @xmath0 and @xmath1 have equal dimension @xmath9 , which is assumed hereafter in this paper .    among the doubly stochastic channels are the _ mixed - unitary _ channels : those for which there exists a collection of unitary operators @xmath10 and a probability distribution @xmath11 so that @xmath12 for all @xmath13 . ( the notation @xmath14 refers to the set of unitary mappings from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . )    for the case @xmath15 it holds that every doubly stochastic channel is mixed - unitary , but for larger @xmath9 this is no longer the case : for all @xmath16 there exist doubly stochastic channels that are not mixed - unitary @xcite .",
    "while it is computationally simple to check that a given channel is doubly stochastic , there is no efficient procedure known to check whether a given channel is mixed - unitary .",
    "several papers have studied properties of mixed - unitary channels within the last several years .",
    "for instance , gregoratti and werner @xcite gave a characterization , with an interesting physical interpretation , of the class of mixed - unitary channels : they proved that a given channel is mixed - unitary if and only if it has full _ quantum corrected capacity _ , which assumes that the correction procedure is permitted arbitrary measurements on the channel s environment .",
    "smolin , verstraete , and winter @xcite further investigated this notion of capacity , and conjectured that many copies of any doubly stochastic channel can be closely approximated by a mixed - unitary channel .",
    "buscemi @xcite investigated bounds on the number @xmath17 required in the expression for different channels ; audenaert and scheel @xcite investigated conditions under which channels are mixed - unitary ; and mendl and wolf  @xcite proved several facts about mixed - unitary channels , including the fact that a non - mixed - unitary channel can become mixed - unitary when tensored with the completely depolarizing channel .",
    "rosgen @xcite recently proved that various additivity questions about general channels reduce to the same questions on the ( potentially simpler ) class of mixed - unitary channels .",
    "this paper proves a simple fact about mixed - unitary channels , which is that every doubly stochastic channel becomes mixed - unitary when properly averaged with the completely depolarizing channel . to state this fact more precisely ,",
    "let us write @xmath18 to denote the completely depolarizing channel , which is defined as @xmath19 for every operator @xmath13 .",
    "this channel is well - known to be mixed - unitary , as it is representable as a uniform mixture over the discrete weyl operators ( also known as the generalized pauli operators ) .",
    "the claimed fact is now stated in the following theorem .    [",
    "theorem : main1 ] let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be @xmath9 dimensional complex hilbert spaces , and let @xmath20 be any doubly stochastic channel .",
    "then for @xmath21 it holds that @xmath22 is a mixed - unitary channel .",
    "it is also proved , as a corollary of this theorem , that within the smallest real affine subspace of super - operators that contains the doubly stochastic channels , there is a ball with positive radius around the completely depolarizing channel within which all super - operators are mixed - unitary channels .",
    "the purpose of this section is to introduce concepts and notation that are needed in the proof of the main result that appears in the following section .",
    "assume throughout the remainder of the paper that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are finite - dimensional complex hilbert spaces for which a common orthonormal basis @xmath23 has been fixed .",
    "we let @xmath24 denote the set of all linear operators from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , and ( as stated above ) the notation @xmath2 is shorthand for @xmath25 ( and likewise for other spaces in place of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the usual ( hilbert  schmidt ) inner product of two operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 is defined as @xmath28    with respect to the standard basis of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we define a linear bijection @xmath29 by setting @xmath30 for @xmath31 , and extending to all of @xmath24 by linearity .    the _ choi - jamiokowski representation _",
    "@xcite of a super - operator @xmath20 is defined as @xmath32 the mapping @xmath33 defined in this way is a linear bijection from the space of all super - operators of the form @xmath34 to the space @xmath35 .",
    "it holds that a super - operator @xmath20 is completely positive if and only if @xmath36 is positive semidefinite , trace - preserving if and only if @xmath37 , and unital if and only if @xmath38 . the following facts may be verified directly :    for any choice of an operator @xmath39 , the super - operator @xmath20 defined by @xmath40 satisfies @xmath41 .    for any choice of operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the super - operator @xmath20 defined by @xmath44 satisfies @xmath45",
    "when combined with the linearity of the mapping @xmath33 , these facts will allow for simple calculations of @xmath36 for particular super - operators @xmath5 appearing later in the paper .",
    "next , let us recall that the _ swap operator _ on @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 and let us write @xmath48 and @xmath49 to denote the orthogonal projections on @xmath46 defined as @xmath50 the projections @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the _ anti - symmetric _ and _ symmetric projections _ on @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "subscripts are used when it is necessary to be explicit about the spaces on which the projections @xmath48 and @xmath49 act ; so , as just defined , the operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 are written more precisely as @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and in general other spaces may be substituted for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the next section",
    "we will make use of the identities @xmath53 & = \\frac{1}{2}{\\operatorname{tr}}(x ) \\i_{\\y } - \\frac{1}{2 } x,\\\\[2 mm ] { \\operatorname{tr}}_{\\x } \\left[(\\i_{\\y } \\otimes x ) s \\right ] & = \\frac{1}{2}{\\operatorname{tr}}(x ) \\i_{\\y } + \\frac{1}{2 } x , \\end{split}\\ ] ] which hold for all @xmath13 .    finally , it is necessary that a few points on integrals over unitary operators are discussed .",
    "let us first note that the collection of mixed - unitary channels @xmath20 is convex and compact . for any measure @xmath54 on the borel subsets of @xmath14 , normalized so that @xmath55 , it follows that the super - operator defined as @xmath56 for every @xmath13 is a mixed - unitary channel  or in other words can be expressed in the form for some finite choice of @xmath17 .",
    "( it can easily be shown , using carathodory s theorem , that such an expression exists for some choice of @xmath57 .",
    "see also buscemi @xcite for bounds based on @xmath58 . )",
    "hereafter let us write @xmath59 to denote the normalized haar measure on @xmath14 .",
    "this is the unique measure on the borel subsets of @xmath14 that satisfies @xmath60 and is invariant under left multiplication by every unitary operator @xmath61 .",
    "it is clear that identity @xmath62 holds",
    ". we will also require the identity @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 represent isomorphic copies of the space @xmath0 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are isomorphic copies of @xmath1 , and we view that @xmath68 the identity may be confirmed by considering the well - known _ twirling _ operation @xcite @xmath69 and taking the choi - jamiokowski representation of both sides .",
    "( for the interested reader , it is noted that the above integrals and , as well as higher - order variants of them , may also be easily evaluated by means of a general formula of collins and niady @xcite . )",
    "we now prove the main theorem , which is restated here for convenience .",
    "theorem  [ theorem : main1 ] let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be @xmath9 dimensional complex hilbert spaces , and let @xmath20 be any doubly stochastic channel .",
    "then for @xmath21 it holds that @xmath22 is a mixed - unitary channel .",
    "given that @xmath70 is mixed - unitary , and that the set of mixed - unitary channels is convex , it suffices to consider the case @xmath71 .",
    "define a super - operator @xmath72 as @xmath73 by the above identity we have that @xmath74 and it is clear that @xmath75 is nonnegative for all @xmath76 .",
    "it follows that @xmath77 is a mixed - unitary channel . to complete the proof",
    ", it will suffice to establish that @xmath78 for then the right - hand - side will be shown to be mixed - unitary as required .    to this end , consider the choi - jamiokowski representation of @xmath77 , which is @xmath79 by the identity we have @xmath80\\\\ & \\quad + \\frac{2}{d(d+1 ) } { \\operatorname{tr}}_{\\y_2\\otimes\\x_2}\\left [ \\left(s_{\\y_1\\otimes\\y_2 } \\otimes s_{\\x_1\\otimes\\x_2}\\right ) \\left(\\i_{\\y_1\\otimes\\x_1 } \\otimes j(\\phi)\\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , in this equation , it is viewed that @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "( as in the previous section , the spaces @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 are isomorphic copies of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . )",
    "the above expression of @xmath83 may now be simplified by means of the equations .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath84\\\\ & \\quad + \\frac{1}{2d(d+1 ) } \\left [ { \\operatorname{tr}}(j(\\phi ) ) \\i_{\\y\\otimes\\x } \\,+\\ , { \\operatorname{tr}}_{\\x}(j(\\phi))\\otimes \\i_{\\x } \\,+\\ , \\i_{\\y}\\otimes { \\operatorname{tr}}_{\\y}(j(\\phi ) ) \\,+\\ , j(\\phi)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] making use of the equalities @xmath38 and @xmath37 ( which follow from @xmath5 being doubly stochastic ) , we have @xmath85 as @xmath33 is a linear bijection , this implies that equation holds , and therefore completes the proof .",
    "this theorem implies that , within the smallest real affine subspace of super - operators that contains the doubly stochastic channels , there is a ball with positive radius around the completely depolarizing channel within which all super - operators are mixed - unitary .",
    "this fact is established by the following corollary .",
    "[ cor : ball ] suppose @xmath20 is a trace - preserving and unital super - operator such that @xmath36 is hermitian and satisfies @xmath86 then @xmath5 is a mixed - unitary channel .",
    "define @xmath87 , which is clearly trace - preserving and unital .",
    "it follows from the expression @xmath88 together with the assumptions of the corollary , that @xmath77 is completely positive , and thus is doubly stochastic . by theorem  [ theorem : main1 ]",
    "we therefore have that @xmath89 is mixed - unitary , as required .",
    "as has been discussed by several authors , the choi - jamiokowski representation reveals density operator analogues to various facts about channels . in the present case ,",
    "the mapping @xmath90 gives a linear bijection from the set of doubly stochastic channels @xmath20 to the collection of density operators @xmath91 whose reduced states on both @xmath1 and @xmath0 are completely mixed : @xmath92 corollary [ cor : ball ] therefore establishes that within the smallest affine subspace that contains all such density operators , there is a ball of positive radius around the maximally mixed state containing only states that are expressible as mixtures of _ maximally entangled _ states .",
    "when expressed in these terms , it is appropriate to compare the results of the previous section with an analogous fact concerning the set of separable states , which are those expressible as mixtures of _ unentangled _ states .",
    "specifically , it follows from the results proved in @xcite that any unit - trace hermitian operator @xmath93 satisfying @xmath94 is a separable density operator . in contrast",
    ", corollary  [ cor : ball ] establishes that any unit - trace hermitian operator @xmath93 satisfying both the linear constraints and the bound @xmath95 is expressible as a convex combination of maximally entangled states .",
    "( it is clear that operators not satisfying the constraints are not expressible as convex combinations of maximally entangled states , regardless of their distance from the maximally mixed state . )",
    "it is noted that the ball defined by is properly contained in the one defined by .",
    "all of the states contained in the smaller ball are therefore representable at two extremes : as convex combinations of unentangled states and convex combinations of maximally entangled states .",
    "to what extent this fact can be generalized is an interesting question for future research ."
