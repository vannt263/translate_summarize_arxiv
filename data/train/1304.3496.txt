    "optical microcavities such as photonic crystal nanocavities @xcite , microring resonators @xcite , toroidal microcavities @xcite and crystalline whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) cavities @xcite are attractive platforms for studying the optical linear and nonlinear properties of light @xcite .",
    "these cavities have been employed in various studies including work on slow light generation @xcite , an ultra - narrow linewidth laser @xcite , an optoelectronic oscillator @xcite , nonlinear switching @xcite , frequency - comb generation @xcite , opto - mechanics @xcite , frequency conversion @xcite , and nanoparticle sensing @xcite .",
    "wgm cavities , which use internal reflection for light confinement , are particularly attractive because they can provide a very high quality factor ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "recent progress on the @xmath0 factor in such cavities has been noteworthy . in particular , cavities made of @xmath1 such as toroidal @xcite and bottle @xcite cavities exhibit a very high-@xmath0 exceeding @xmath2 because @xmath1 is a low - loss material and the laser reflow process is well established . on the other hand ,",
    "wgm cavities made of crystal materials also exhibit an ultrahigh-@xmath0 , because their absorption loss is even lower than that of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "crystalline materials are also attractive because they have various unique properties .",
    "the large @xmath4 nonlinearity is essential for making building blocks for optoelectronic modulators @xcite .",
    "it is transparent at infrared wavelengths , which is an interesting regime for gas sensing @xcite .",
    "it also has a large young s modulus , which is attractive for opto - mechanics research @xcite . with the development of ultra - precise machining ,",
    "the properties of micro - resonators made of crystal materials have improved , and they are now good candidates especially as a platform on which to study nonlinear optics .",
    "however , a high-@xmath0 crystalline wgm cavity is still difficult to fabricate because the material is hard and frangible . in particular",
    ", the fabrication of a small cavity remains a challenge .",
    "previously , we reported on the fabrication of sapphire ( @xmath5 ) wgm cavities by employing a modified laser heated pedestal growth ( lhpg ) method to overcome this problem @xcite .",
    "the lhpg method was originally developed for manufacturing fiber lasers @xcite .",
    "it has been applied to various materials such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 and yag @xcite .",
    "in contrast to earlier work , in which researchers tried to fabricate crystal rods with a thinner and uniform radius , we used this method to fabricate a rod with a locally modulated radius to enable light confinement in the longitudinal direction and excite the wgm .",
    "changing the growth rate enabled us to fabricate a swollen region , in which we obtained a wgm with a @xmath0 of @xmath8 . in our work",
    ", we demonstrate the fabrication of sapphire wgm cavities that have a hexagonal cross - section but with round edges .",
    "the controllability of the cross - section ( the sharpness of the edges ) is the key to controlling the @xmath0 factor of such a cavity .    in this paper , we analyze in detail various wg - like modes excited in hexagonal cavities with different corner curvatures . in particular , we study a quasi - wgm and a newly discovered perturbed - wgm . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time a perturbed - wgm has been characterized . by understanding the property of the perturbed - wgm , and investigating the coupling between these two modes , we reveal the limit of the @xmath0 of the quasi - wgm and study a possible way of improving the value .",
    "we also demonstrate the fabrication and optical measurement of a sapphire hexagonal wgm cavity that supports such a mode .",
    "we show that a high @xmath0 cavity is obtained with a cavity with round corners , whose growth is carefully controlled to obtain good crystal quality .",
    "the polygonal cavity analysis described in this paper is useful for cavities fabricated with lhpg , moreover it provides information needed to understand the optical properties of a polygonal toroidal microcavity @xcite , and microcavity lasers made of zno @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite , and @xmath12 @xcite , that are fabricated with the vapor phase transport method .",
    "these microlasers have recently attracted great interest .",
    "it is known that these microcavities have a polygonal cross - section as a result of their crystal structure , and various experimental and numerical studies has been conducted to understand the mode property of such cavities , especially in zno .",
    "for example , wiersing @xcite , nobis and grundmann @xcite , and huang @xcite have analyzed the features of the modes in this unique cavity with triangular , hexagonal and circular cross - sections .",
    "crystals were grown experimentally on zno with different deposition temperatures .",
    "this enabled the growth of zno micro wires with different cross - sections , including hexagonal , dodecagonal , and circular @xcite .",
    "al _ tried to improve the @xmath0 value by rounding the corners of polygons @xcite .",
    "however , the reported @xmath0 of these microresonators remains on the order of several thousand , even though the excited modes , which they call a `` quasi - wgm '' , seem to satisfy the total internal reflection in a ray - optics framework @xcite .",
    "since we have a same problem in our sapphire hexagonal cavity , the purpose of the first half of this paper is to provide a clear understanding of the limiting @xmath0 of this mode in a polygonal cavity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we introduce the structure of the cavity we fabricated for investigation .",
    "we investigate the properties of the perturbed - wgm and quasi - wgm , paying particular attention to the influence of the coupling between these two modes .",

    "iii , we describe the fabrication and optical measurement of this cavity .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec .",

    "figure  [ fig:16](c ) shows an optical microscope image of the cross - section of this cavity .",
    "the shape is hexagonal as a result of the crystal structure of the sapphire .",
    "however , the corners of the cavity are not sharp but round , and their curvature radius can be controlled by changing the growth condition .",
    "this cavity is on interest of mode analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig:0 ] shows the ray - optics description of the possible modes in a hexagonal cavity with slightly rounded corners .",
    "fabry - perot ( fp ) modes ( fig .",
    "[ fig:0](a ) and ( b ) ) are excited by reflection at the opposing disk facets or at the hexagonal facets @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:0](c ) and ( d ) show `` quasi - wgms '' in which light is reflected at the side of the polygon .",
    "since these modes satisfy the total internal reflection in a ray - optics framework , the quasi - wgm appears to exhibit an ultrahigh-@xmath0 .",
    "although , the quasi - wgm has been studied in detail in previous work @xcite , we will show below that the discovery of a different wgm , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0](e ) , is essential if we are to understand the low-@xmath0 of the quasi - wgm .",
    "we call this mode a `` perturbed - wgm '' @xcite , because this is an ultrahigh-@xmath0 wgm when the cavity is round . a complete understanding of these modes is the main aim of this paper .",
    "in addition , we show that a different mode , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0](f ) , which has usually been categorized as a quasi - wgm , originates from a higher order wgm .        to investigate these modes in detail",
    "we perform a two - dimensional finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) calculation .",
    "figure  [ fig:1](a ) shows the structure that we used for the calculation .",
    "it is a hexagonal cavity with round corners that have curvature radiuses @xmath14 .",
    "when the microcavity is a perfect circle , an ideal wgm is excited as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) .",
    "next we change @xmath14 and make the cavity slightly polygonal .",
    "then we obtain an optical mode as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) .",
    "this is the quasi - wgm shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0](d ) .",
    "the light propagates while being reflected at the side of the cavity .",
    "this simple picture leads us to expect that the resonant wavelength and the @xmath0 of the quasi - wgm do not depend strongly on the edge radius @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast , we obtained a different mode in a hexagonal cavity for the same geometry as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](d ) .",
    "this is the `` perturbed - wgm '' .",
    "the original circular wgm is perturbed as a result of the modulation of the structure from circular to hexagonal .",
    "but it retains the wgm characteristics , where the light propagates close to the surface .",
    "note that if we look very carefully , we find that the light of this mode propagates close to the surface at the corner , but it propagates slightly inwards at the side @xcite .",

    "( c )  mode profile of quasi - wgm when @xmath16 .",
    "( d )  mode profile of a perturbed - wgm when @xmath16.,width=240 ]    in contrast to the quasi - wgm , with the perturbed - wgm we can straightforwardly predict that the resonant wavelength and @xmath0 value change sensitively according to the corner radius @xmath14 .    since this mode exhibits an ultrahigh-@xmath0 when the corner is round , we expect the @xmath0 of the perturbed - wgm to be higher than that of the quasi - wgm when @xmath14 is large .",
    "however , the @xmath14 dependence of the @xmath0 is larger for the perturbed - wgm , therefore , the @xmath0 of the quasi - wgm should become higher when the corner is sharp and the cavity is hexagonal .",
    "but , this simple description is insufficient as we discuss in the following sections .        .",

    "[ fig:2](a ) that the wgm of the circular cavity shown in fig .  [ fig:1](b ) is on the same slope as the perturbed wgm in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](d ) .",
    "this indicates that the mode shown in fig .  [",
    "fig:1](d ) is indeed a `` perturbed '' wgm , and the quasi - wgm originates from a different mode from an ultrahigh-@xmath0 wgm when the cavity is circular .    .",
    "( b - e )  mode profiles of the cavity .",
    "the corresponding resonance points are shown in ( a).,width=288 ]    next , we investigate the resonance in more detail .",
    "figure  [ fig:2](b ) shows the resonant spectrum when @xmath18 .",
    "this spectrum shows that not only two modes , but also various other different modes are excited in this hexagonal cavity . to explain the property of the hexagonal cavity",
    ", we need to understand these modes .",
    "since it is difficult to characterize the property of this number of modes from this single spectrum , we need to perform calculations with different @xmath14 .",

    "however , a number of different peaks appear in addition to these two modes .",
    "although the behavior of these modes appears very complicated , they can be classified into two different groups .",
    "we clearly obtained two different slopes .",
    "figure  [ fig:3](b ) shows a quasi - wgm but with a different longitudinal mode number .",
    "similar resonance also appears at an 11.6 nm longer wavelength , where the interval is the free - spectral range ( fsr ) of this mode .",
    "indeed , we obtained a similar fsr value from a simple ray - optics estimation .",
    "similarly , fig .",
    "[ fig:3](c ) shows a perturbed - wgm with a different longitudinal mode number .",
    "the fsr for the perturbed - wgm is 11.3  nm",
    ".    however , fig .",
    "[ fig:3](c ) shows that there are a number of different modes with a similar @xmath14 dependence to that of the perturbed - wgm in the hexagonal cavity .",
    "one of the modes is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](d ) . in this mode",
    ", the light propagates not only at the surface of the cavity , but also at the inner part of the structure .",
    "this propagation occurs because the light reflects at the cavity wall with a large incident angle .",
    "the light propagation in this mode is described in terms of ray - optics in fig .",
    "[ fig:0](f ) , where the mode was originally classified as a quasi - wgm . however , the @xmath14 dependence of this mode in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) suggests that its behavior is similar to that of the perturbed - wgm .",
    "indeed , when we examine the profile at @xmath19 for this mode , namely when the cavity is circular , we observe a higher order wgm as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](e ) .",
    "hence , we can conclude that the mode shown in fig.5(d ) is the perturbed mode of the higher order wgm .",
    "it is important to understand this picture , because it indicates the difficulty of obtaining a high-@xmath0 for the mode shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](e ) , even though the ray - optics image in fig .  [ fig:0](f ) gives the impression that this mode may exhibit an ultrahigh @xmath0 even when the corner is sharp .      since the quasi and perturbed wgms ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) and ( d ) ) are the fundamental modes of this hexagonal cavity , we now focus on these two modes and analyze the @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows the @xmath0s of these two modes with different @xmath14 values .",
    "contrary to our initial expectation , the quasi - wgm exhibits a lower @xmath0 when the cavity is polygonal , although fig .",
    "[ fig:0](d ) suggests that the @xmath0 is only slightly dependent on @xmath14 .     of perturbed and quasi wgms for hexagonal cavity with different curvature radius @xmath14 values.,width=288 ]    to understand this behavior , we pay close attention to the wavelength crossing between the quasi - wgm and the perturbed - wgm .",
    "figure  [ fig:6](a ) and ( b ) show enhanced views of the crossing points between the perturbed and quasi - wgms in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) .",
    "the figures show that these two modes exhibit anti - crossing behavior , which indicates the existence of strong mode coupling between those two modes .",
    "we can derive the coupling coefficient @xmath20 from the spectrum splitting width , and we obtained @xmath21 for fig .",
    "[ fig:6](a ) and @xmath22 for fig .",
    "[ fig:6](b ) .",
    "this explains the low @xmath0 property of the quasi - wgm when the corners are sharp .    according to the ray - optics description shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0](d ) , the @xmath0 of the quasi - wgm does not depend on the edge radius @xmath14 of the hexagonal cavity and should exhibit an ultrahigh @xmath0 . however , the coupling between the quasi- and perturbed - wgms needs to be taken into account .",
    "this coupling is particularly important when @xmath14 is small .",
    "coupling between modes , for example @xmath23 , which corresponds to a @xmath0 of about @xmath24 , means that the light energy of the high-@xmath0 quasi - wgm transfers to a low-@xmath0 perturbed - wgm and then easily couples to the out - of- cavity radiation .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 of the quasi - wgm is not dependent on the @xmath0 of the perturbed - wgm and the values of those two modes become very close . since the @xmath0 value of the perturbed - wgm is low when the corner is sharp , the @xmath0 value of the quasi - wgm also decreases .",
    "the very low @xmath0 plots ( @xmath25 ) of the quasi - wgm in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] result from coupling with higher order perturbed - wgms that have a low @xmath0 .",
    "a numerical analysis revealed that the @xmath0 of quasi - wgm is fundamentally dependent on the @xmath0 of the perturbed - wgm .",
    "since the @xmath0 of the perturbed - wgm is low when the corner radius @xmath14 is small , it is not easy to obtain a high-@xmath0 cavity even when we excite the quasi - wgm .",
    "therefore , the only method with the potential to provide a high @xmath0 in such a crystalline cavity is to make the shape as circular as possible . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we show methods for fabricating circular sapphire wgm cavities by using lhpg to achieve a high @xmath0 .      in this section , we discuss the optimal radius of the hexagonal cavity .",
    "we focus on the perturbed - wgm in a hexagonal cavity with a radius @xmath26 and a curvature radius @xmath27 .",
    "it is known that the @xmath0 of a circular wgm cavity increases linearly as the radius increases @xcite . however",
    ", this characteristic has not been studied for a polygonal wgm cavity .",
    "factor of perturbed - wgm as a function of the radius @xmath26 of hexagonal cavities with a curvature radius @xmath28.,width=240 ]    figure  [ fig : diameter](a ) shows the @xmath0 factor for the perturbed - wgm for hexagonal cavities with different cavity radius @xmath14 .",
    "it clearly shows that there is an optimal point at @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath0 value decreases when @xmath30 is small , because it is difficult for the light in the cavity to satisfy the total internal reflection condition when the cavity is small .",
    "moreover , unlike a circular cavity , the @xmath0 value decreases when @xmath31 , which is difficult to explain solely in terms of total internal reflection .",
    "a careful investigation revealed that mode coupling plays an important role . in a large cavity , the mode spacing of the lowest order perturbed - wgm and that of the higher order perturbed - wgm are both very small , which results in an easy overlap between these modes .",
    "since higher order - wgms have a much lower @xmath0 , the @xmath0 of the lowest - order perturbed - wgm also decreases for a large cavity . therefore , there is an optimum radius as regards obtaining a high-@xmath0 in a hexagonal cavity .",
    "figure  [ fig:10 ] shows the experimental setup for the lhpg method .",
    "the input @xmath32 laser beam ( coherent diamond c-70 ) is formed into a doughnut shape by using a pair of axicon lenses .",
    "this minimizes the beam that hits the feed rod before it is focused with a concave mirror , and it makes the beam focusing more efficient . the @xmath32 laser beam is focused on the feed rod by using a concave mirror with a radius of 50  mm to heat the rod and form a molten zone .",
    "the laser beam spot size is about @xmath33 , and the power density is @xmath34 when the @xmath32 laser power is 4.0  w. both the seed and feed rods are fixed to a linear translation stage ( oriental motor asm46ma ) .",
    "the radius of the sapphire single crystal rods is @xmath35 for both the feed and seed rods .",
    "laser with diameter @xmath36 and beam parameter product @xmath37 is used to heat the crystal rods.,width=240 ]    then a crystal fiber is grown by pulling the feed rod upwards at a speed of @xmath38 , while the seed rod is moved in the same direction with a speed of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) . in lhpg , we can control the radius of the grown crystal rods by changing the velocity rate whose relationship is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the radiuses of the grown and feed rods , respectively .",
    "lhpg was originally developed to create crystal rods with a uniform radius .",
    "in contrast , by changing the velocity rate we can create a bulge with which we can confine light in the longitudinal direction and excite the wgm .    in the experiment , we changed the velocity rate from 1/6 to 1/3 .",
    "this corresponds to calculated @xmath44 values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , when the feed rod radius @xmath47 is @xmath35 .",
    "first , we started with standard lhpg .",
    "@xmath48 was set at @xmath49 and @xmath50 was set at @xmath51 . in brief , the @xmath52 was 1/6 and the grown rod was fabricated with a radius of @xmath53 .",
    "next , we reduced @xmath39 from @xmath54 to @xmath55 and set the @xmath52 ratio at 1/3 to fabricate a wgm cavity . the grown radius of the wgm cavity was then larger at @xmath56 . finally , we stopped the seed rod and pulled the feed rod downward .    a side view and cross - section of the fabricated cavity",

    "the cross - section of this cavity is hexagonal as a result of the crystalline structure of the sapphire .",
    "as discussed earlier in this paper , it is essential to develop a method for controlling the curvature of the edge radius of this cavity in order to increase the @xmath0 .",
    "we introduce a pre - heating method to make the cavity round .",

    "the surface roughness is 6  nm.,width=288 ]",
    "we investigated excited modes in polygonal cavities in detail and found that a perturbed - wgm exhibits an ultrahigh @xmath0 when the corner radius of the cavity is large .",
    "we found that a number of lower and higher order perturbed - wgms are present in a hexagonal cavity coupled with a quasi - wgm .",
    "although the quasi - wgm appears to exhibit an ultrahigh-@xmath0 with ray - optics , mode coupling with the perturbed - wgm limits the @xmath0 of this mode .",
    "we revealed that we need to understand the coupling between the modes to explain the low @xmath0 of the quasi - wgm when the cavity is hexagonal . as a result ,",
    "the only way to improve the @xmath0 of the crystalline cavity ( with both sapphire and zno cavities ) is to make the corner round . with this in mind , we showed pre - heating method that can control the cross - section of the fabricated cavity . although some degeneracy of the crystal was observed , this effect was limited . despite the experimental @xmath0 of the current device being limited by the surface roughness",
    ", we showed that further optimization is possible .",
    "research using wgm cavities is active in various fields including micro - laser fabrication , quantum - optics , sensing , and signal processing .",
    "however , the fabrication of a crystalline wgm remains difficult because of its fragility .",
    "this study will contribute to the provision of an alternative method for fabricating very small crystalline wgms by lhpg for use in these fields .",
