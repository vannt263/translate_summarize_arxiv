    "clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally - collapsed structures in the universe .",
    "the study of their number density and growth from high density perturbations in the early universe offers insight into the underlying cosmology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the use of clusters as a cosmological probe requires an efficient method to find clusters over a wide redshift range , an observational method of determining the cluster mass and a method to compute the selection function or the survey volume in which clusters are found @xcite .",
    "a variety of observational techniques has been brought to bear on these requirements , each with different strengths and weaknesses .",
    "early samples of clusters were based upon optical selection , however these samples have traditionally suffered from projection effects and uncertainties in the optical richness - mass relation .",
    "recently , the first clusters have been detected in blind surveys using the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "this method holds much promise due to the redshift independence of the sze @xcite , however the use of the sze as a mass estimator remains largely untested . until now , the most effective method of building large , well defined cluster samples has been via x - ray selection .",
    "the high x - ray luminosities of clusters makes it relatively easy to detect and study clusters out to high redshifts , and x - ray cluster studies have provided a means to impose tight constraints on cosmological parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a common weakness of the three techniques outlined above is that the clusters are selected based on the properties of their minority baryonic content .",
    "however , cosmological constraints from those clusters are based on their masses , dominated by dark matter .",
    "this gives rise to complications both in the estimation of cluster masses ( which must be inferred from the observed baryon properties ) and in the determination of sample selection functions .",
    "incorporating selection functions in any cosmological model depends crucially on the form and scatter of the relationship between the observable used to detect the cluster , and the cluster mass .    in principle",
    ", these complications may be avoided by defining cluster samples through gravitational lensing , the most direct observational probe of cluster masses .",
    "the development of weak lensing ( abbreviated wl throughout ) techniques has enabled the detection of clusters via the distortions of background galaxy shapes leading to the construction of wl selected cluster surveys .",
    "these include the deep lens survey @xcite and our _ subaru _ weak lensing survey @xcite , both @xmath120 deg@xmath2 , and the large ( @xmath3170 deg@xmath4 ) cfht legacy survey @xcite .",
    "however , while wl techniques are free from assumptions about the relationship between baryonic and dark matter in clusters , they are susceptible to the possibility of projection of multiple structures along the line of sight , leading to overestimates of cluster masses or false detections .",
    "this paper aims to determine the x - ray properties of clusters detected via their wl signal . by constructing scaling relations based on the measured x - ray properties",
    ", we will determine whether the clusters follow simple scaling theory , which is a key ingredient in the determination of cosmological parameters .",
    "one of the most important measurements for use in cosmological studies is that of the cluster mass .",
    "much work has been done to determine cluster masses from weak lensing observations , and the comparison to x - ray observables and x - ray determined masses , however this is primarily based on x - ray selected cluster samples .",
    "we will compare the scaling relation between the x - ray luminosity and wl mass from wl selected and x - ray selected samples .",
    "the derivation of the wl cluster mass assumes that the clusters follow spherical symmetry .",
    "we investigate this assumption and determine the dynamical state and cool - core fraction of wl selected clusters .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in @xmath5  [ sec : wlreduc ] we discuss the sample selection and data reduction .",
    "the derivation of the cluster properties is given in @xmath5  [ sec : wlprops ] .",
    "in @xmath5  [ sec : wlresults ] we present the results of our x - ray analysis and derive scaling relations .",
    "our discussions and conclusions are presented in @xmath5  [ sec : wldisc ] and @xmath5  [ sec : wlconclusion ] respectively . throughout this paper",

    "we re - derive the lm relation for the wl selected clusters , with the wl masses corrected for these effects . figure  [ fig : wllm_bias ] plots the corrected lm relation , with each of the lines corresponding to a fit with the cumulative effect of these corrections taken into account . from the final fit to the mass corrected lm relation ( fig  [ fig : wllm_bias ] , red solid line ) , we find @xmath17=(4.7@xmath00.6)@xmath1910@xmath12 ergs s@xmath9 , with the slope fixed at @xmath20=1.33 .",
    "the comparison with the @xcite lm relation has been greatly reduced , and we find that the wl selected clusters are now consistent with x - ray selected clusters samples , albeit with three clusters being low luminosity outliers .",
    "we note that the clusters are only consistent when using wl masses derived within r@xmath21 , which may obscure the underlying discrepency .",
    "these corrections therefore show that clusters detected from wl surveys suffer from biases which have a large effect on the derived lm relation . by considering a series of plausible biases on the wl mass , the discrepancy in the lm relation , when compared to x - ray selected clusters , can be resolved .      in the following sections we discuss further biases which may have an effect when comparing wl and x - ray hydrostatic mass calculations .",
    "it has been shown that correlated and uncorrelated large - scale structure ( lss ) along the los , can both induce bias and scatter in the wl mass .",
    "we should also note that the effects of lss and triaxiality are related , where it can be considered that the major axis of halos is correlated with filamentary lss .",
    "the distribution of bcg ellipticities suggests that 60@xmath22 of our clusters are viewed with the major axis close to the los , from which we can assume that they will also be affected by lss along the los .",
    "however , note that since they consider all the mass within 20 h@xmath9mpc in their lensing simulations , the effect of correlated lss is partially included in their estimate of the lensing mass .",
    "therefore , the correction applied to our wl masses in section  [ sec : wlellipt ] based upon , should partially include corrections for lss .",
    "the effect of uncorrelated lss has been found to not bias the wl mass , but adds additional scatter @xmath115 - 30@xmath22 as a function of cluster mass @xcite .",
    "simulations have shown that hydrostatic mass estimates of galaxy clusters are systematically biased towards underestimates of the true mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since hydrostatic estimates only take into account thermal pressure , the presence of additional pressure from random gas motions are neglected , and hence bias the mass low .",
    "it has been shown from simulations that up to @xmath15%-20% of pressure support comes from random gas motions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the picture from observations is unclear .",
    "a recent study of 22 clusters detected by _ planck _ , found that the average x - ray hydrostatic masses were 0.688@xmath00.072 times lower than the masses determined from wl @xcite .",
    "since the masses of the @xcite clusters are derived from a relation based upon x - ray hydrostatic mass estimates , in principle we can assume that their cluster masses are underestimated at the 10s% level .    as stated in section  [ sec : wllm ] , the masses in @xcite are derived from the gas mass .",
    "they note that they incorporate a systematic fractional bias at @xmath23 of 0.0325@xmath00.06 on the gas mass measurements , based upon the simulations of @xcite .",
    "therefore , this bias will be incorporated in the lm relation comparison . however , as our clusters probe a lower mass distribution than the @xcite sample ( all @xmath243@xmath1910@xmath25 ) , could the offset be explained by an increasing hydrostatic mass bias for lower cluster masses ?",
    "the effect would be to not only lower the normalisation of the x - ray lm relation , but to also increase the slope , further decreasing the discrepancy of the lm relations .",
    "however , our comparison to the lower mass clusters of and groups of do not offer better agreement with our wl selected clusters .",
    "this has also been investigated based on simulations .",
    "@xcite showed that there is a weak correlation of mass underestimate with cluster mass , with low mass clusters ( @xmath110@xmath26m@xmath27 ) having larger mass bias .",
    "@xcite find an underestimate of @xmath320% at 10@xmath26m@xmath27 .",
    "recently , @xcite compared x - ray and wl cluster masses for a sample of 8 clusters in the 0.4@xmath28z@xmath280.5 redshift range .",
    "they find a 1:1 correlation between the two mass estimates , but observe an intriguing mass bias at low wl masses at the @xmath32@xmath29 level .",
    "however , other studies have found no hydrostatic mass bias as a function of mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      , width=222 ]",
    "we compare to the sample of clusters studied in @xcite , which is an x - ray selected cluster sample with wl derived cluster masses .",
    "the main advantage of choosing this sample is that the wl masses are derived within a wl determined @xmath23 .",
    "as we have shown in figure  [ fig : wllm_bias ] , the choice of @xmath23 had the largest effect on the derived wl mass and may obscure any further underlying biases . by making this comparison we can remove the large effect of the choice of @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , by comparing to wl masses the effects of hydrostatic mass bias ( see @xmath5  [ sec : xmassbias ] ) , and to a lesser extent the wl mass bias due to lss ( see @xmath5  [ sec : lss ] , but could still be larger in our sample compared to @xcite , due to the wl selection ) will be reduced or removed .",
    "figure  [ fig : wllm_mahdavicomp ] plots the lm relation for our wl selected clusters ( red triangles ) , and compared to the clusters studied in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* brown circles ) .",
    "for the purposes of this comparison the x - ray luminosities are bolometric and in each case the wl masses are determined within a wl defined @xmath23 .",
    "we fit a power law of the form @xmath30 to the @xcite clusters finding a normalisation of @xmath31=(2.83@xmath00.47)@xmath1910@xmath32ergs s@xmath9 and slope @xmath33=1.89@xmath00.83 , with @xmath34=8@xmath1910@xmath26m@xmath27 .",

    "for a given mass we find that our wl selected clusters are 5.4@xmath01.4 times under - luminous as compared to the @xcite clusters in terms of the lm relation , with the masses derived from wl and within a wl determined @xmath23 ( corrected for centroid position , eddington bias and triaxiality ) .",
    "conversely , the masses are over - estimated by a factor 2.4@xmath00.3 for a given luminosity . to validate that the x - ray selected clusters of @xcite , whose masses are derived from wl and within r@xmath36 , follow other x - ray selected clusters , we plot the clusters ( fig  [ fig : wllm_mahdavicomp ] , green squares ) .",
    "clearly , the two x - ray selected samples are in agreement , even though the mass estimates are from two different methods , with our wl selected clusters offset from both samples .",
    "we note that if the @xcite wl masses are calculated within an x - ray derived @xmath23 , this has a negligible effect on their lm relation .",
    "since the discrepancy with the @xcite sample is still prevalent ( see fig  [ fig : wllm_mahdavicomp ] ) , even after correcting our wl masses for centroid position , eddington bias and triaxiality , this implies that there is still some underlying effect due to the wl selection of these clusters .",
    "in section  [ sec : systematics ] we have shown that by considering various systematic effects on the wl cluster mass , we are unable to reconcile the differences seen in the lm relation ( see figure  [ fig : wllm_mahdavicomp ] ) , without including corrections for r@xmath37 which we argue masks the true discrepancy ( see @xmath5  [ sec : wlmasscomp ] , fig  [ fig : wllm_mahdavicomp ] ) . not only that , our previous work ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 5 ) found that the wl mass is consistent with previous studies when compared to the velocity dispersion ( @xmath38 ) .",

    "* @xmath38=1402@xmath41 km s@xmath9 ) is likely an overestimate .",
    "we therefore re - derive @xmath38 from our tree analysis using the galaxies from group b ( see fig  [ fig : slj1634 ] , balck squares ) , as two of these galaxies are associated with the x - ray emission , finding @xmath38=390@xmath0220 km s@xmath9 .",
    "we find that five of the wl selected clusters are clearly under - luminous for their velocity dispersion .",
    "these results imply that there is a strong systematic effect remaining that is influencing the wl and dynamical properties , the icm properties , or both .",
    "we consider the most plausible effect to be a high incidence of projected filamentary structure along the los to these wl selected clusters , leading to enhanced wl masses and @xmath38 relative to halo mass . from the spectroscopic follow - up , many of the clusters show signs of non - gaussianity in their velocity dispersion histograms ( see fig 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would be consistent with projected filament structure .",
    "this however is based on relatively small numbers of spectra in each case ( an average of 14 galaxies per cluster ) , so a more detailed analysis is unable to be performed .",
    "@xcite investigated a sample of optically selected , x - ray under - luminous clusters and proposed two scenarios for their observed offset in the @xmath42-@xmath38 relation . either the clusters have not yet formed or are at a stage of rapid mass accretion , which would be manifested in a low x - ray luminosity .",

    "other previous studies looking at x - ray under - luminous clusters favour the scenario that these clusters are still in a stage of formation or that the gas has been expelled . however , since we have measured temperatures for the majority of our clusters and shown that the gas properties scale consistently in the luminosity - temperature relation ( and consistent to x - ray selected cluster samples ) , we favour the scenario that the wl selected clusters are embedded in filaments viewed near the los .",

    "the centroid shifts for the wl clusters show that the majority appears dynamically unrelaxed compared to x - ray selected samples , suggesting x - ray cluster surveys preferentially detect clusters that are morphologically relaxed and/or wl selection favours morphologically disturbed clusters .",

    "<S> we present the results of an x - ray follow - up campaign targeting 10 weak lensing ( wl ) selected galaxy clusters from a _ subaru _ wl survey . </S>",
    "<S> eight clusters were studied with dedicated _ chandra _ pointings , whereas archival x - ray data were used for the remaining two clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the wl clusters appear to fit the same scaling relation between x - ray luminosity and temperature as x - ray selected clusters . </S>",
    "<S> however , when we consider the luminosity - mass relation , the wl selected clusters appear underluminous by a factor 3.9@xmath00.9 ( or , alternatively , more massive by 2.9@xmath00.2 ) , compared to x - ray selected clusters . only by considering various observational effects that could potentially bias wl masses , </S>",
    "<S> can this difference be reconciled . </S>",
    "<S> we used x - ray imaging data to quantify the dynamical state of the clusters and found that one of the clusters appears dynamically relaxed , and two of the clusters host a cool core , consistent with sunyaev - zeldovich effect selected clusters . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that regular , cool core clusters may be over - represented in x - ray selected samples .    </S>",
