    "dileptons are powerful probes that deliver multi - faced information : from the in - medium properties of hadrons to the nature of the deconfinement phase transition and to the properties of the deconfined state itself . already in 1978 ,",
    "e.  shuryak proposed to use dileptons as probes of the qgp @xcite because the temperature of the plasma should be given by the inverse slope of the expected exponential spectral shape of its dilepton radiation . on the other hand ,",
    "dileptons are emitted over the entire space - time evolution of the heavy - ion collision , from the initial nucleon - nucleon collisions through the hot and dense phase and to the hadron decays after freeze - out .",
    "this is both a challenge and advantage of the probe .",
    "early concepts of the qgp were guided by the idea of a weakly interacting system of partons which might be described by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "however , experimental observations at the relativistic - heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) indicated that the new medium created in ultrarelativistic au+au collisions was interacting more strongly than hadronic matter and consequently this concept had to be given up .",
    "in the present work , the dynamical evolution of the system is described by the phsd transport approach  @xcite incorporating the off - shell propagation of the partonic quasi - particles according to  @xcite as well as the transition to resonant hadronic states ( or strings ) in line with lorentz - invariant off - shell transition rates ( cf  @xcite ) for the fusion of quark - antiquark pairs to mesonic states or three quarks ( antiquarks ) to baryonic states .",
    "dilepton radiation by partonic off - shell quasi - particles is calculated in an effective field theory  @xcite . by comparing our results to experimental data",
    ", we aim to deduce the in - medium vector meson properties as well as the properties of the nonperturbative qgp .",
    "[ offshell ]    a consistent dynamical approach ",
    "valid also for strongly interacting systems  can be formulated on the basis of the kadanoff - baym equations @xcite or off - shell transport equations in phase - space representation , respectively @xcite . in the kadanoff - baym theory",
    "the field quanta are described in terms of propagators with complex selfenergies . whereas the real part of the selfenergies can be related to mean - field potentials , the imaginary parts provide information about the lifetime and/or reaction rates of time - like particles @xcite .",
    "once the proper ( complex ) selfenergies of the degrees of freedom are known , the time evolution of the system is fully governed by off - shell transport equations ( as described in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the phsd approach is a microscopic covariant transport model that incorporates effective partonic as well as hadronic degrees of freedom and involves a dynamical description of the hadronization process from partonic to hadronic matter @xcite . whereas the hadronic part is essentially equivalent to the conventional hsd approach @xcite the partonic dynamics",
    "is based on the dynamical quasiparticle model ( dqpm ) @xcite which describes qcd properties in terms of single - particle green s functions ( in the sense of a two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) approach ) and leads to effective strongly interacting partonic quasiparticles with broad spectral functions as degrees of freedom .",
    "the off - shell parton dynamics also allows for a solution of the hadronization problem : the hadronization occurs by quark - antiquark fusion or 3 quark/3 antiquark recombination which is described by covariant transition rates .",
    "since the dynamical quarks become very massive , the formed resonant pre - hadronic color - dipole states ( @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) are of high invariant mass , too , and sequentially decay to the ground state meson and baryon octets increasing the total entropy .",
    "this solves the entropy problem in hadronization in a natural way  @xcite .",
    "the elementary processes involved in the dilepton radiation by the strongly interacting qgp are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] .",
    "the diagrams look like those in pqcd , however , we use an effective theory , where important modifications to pqcd are incorporated : 1 ) the non - perturbative spectral functions and self - energies of the quarks , anti - quark and gluons are taken into account ( _ i.e. _ the quark and gluon lines are dressed ) , 2 ) the running dpqm coupling @xmath5 depends on the local energy density @xmath6  @xcite related to a temperature @xmath7 by the lqcd equation of state . in particular , a non - zero width of quarks leads to higher - twist corrections to the standard pqcd approach  @xcite .",
    "note that the processes sub - leading in @xmath5 are not small in this phenomenological model . to make quantitative comparison to data",
    ", we include the following @xmath8 partonic processes as sources of the dileptons in addition to the simple leading order drell - yan @xmath9 annihilation mechanism : gluon compton scattering ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and quark + anti - quark annihilation with gluon bremsstrahlung in the final state ( @xmath12 ) . by implementation of the off - shell cross sections into the phsd transport we can calculate the dilepton radiation from the nonequilibrium strongly - interacting qgp .",
    "[ data ]    let us start with results on the in - medium properties of vector mesons and move to the dilepton radiation from the qgp later on .",
    "various models predict that hadrons change in the ( hot and dense ) nuclear medium ; in particular , a broadening of the spectral function or a mass shift of the vector mesons was expected to be considerable .",
    "furthermore , qcd sum rules indicated that a mass shift may lead to a broadening and vice versa  @xcite ; therefore both modifications should be studied simultaneously , too . thus we explore three possible scenarios : ( 1 ) a broadening of the @xmath13 spectral function , ( 2 ) a mass shift , and ( 3 ) a broadening plus a mass shift .",
    "the hsd off - shell transport approach allows to investigate in a consistent way the different scenarios for the modification of vector mesons in a hot and dense medium . in the off - shell transport ,",
    "meson spectral functions change dynamically during the propagation through the medium and evolve towards the on - shell spectral function in the vacuum .    as we find in fig .",
    "[ excessspectra ] the na60 data favor the scenario of the in - medium broadening of vector mesons .",
    "note that in the data - presented in this plot - the d - meson contribution has not been subtracted .",
    "the na60 collaboration has published acceptance corrected data with subtracted charm contribution recently . the comparison to the new data set leads to the same conclusions as here and will be presented in an extended publication @xcite .",
    "note that a comparison of hsd results for the free case and the three in - medium scenarios to the ceres data in  @xcite also has shown that the spectrum is described better , if a broadening of the @xmath13-meson spectral function in the medium is assumed ( cf .",
    "fig . 4 in  @xcite ) .",
    "[ a ] [ b ]    on the other hand , there is a discrepancy between the hsd ( hadronic ) results and the data in the intermediate of mass range above 1  gev .",
    "this discrepancy is not accounted for by hadronic sources in hsd  in - medium or free  and might be seen as a signal of partonic matter , manifest already at the top sps energy .",
    "the calculation of the qgp contribution in phsd fully accounts for the observed excess ( cf .",
    "the bands in fig .",
    "[ excessspectra ] ) .",
    "the intriguing finding of the na60 collaboration is that the effective temperature of the dileptons in the intermediate mass range is lower than the @xmath14 of the dileptons from the hadronic phase !",
    "this implies that the quark - antiquark annihilation ( or partonic channels ) occur dominantly before the collective radial flow has developed .",
    "this feature of the data is also reproduced in phsd ( cf .",
    "[ slopes ] , rhs ) .",
    "a detailed look at the phsd results confirms that the lower mass region is dominated by hadronic sources while the spectrum in the intermediate mass range is dominated by the off - shell partonic channels in the qgp  @xcite .",
