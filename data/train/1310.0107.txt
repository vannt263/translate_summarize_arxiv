    "<S> [ eq : wp ] does not support a polarized state , but as the cell expands , the polarized state and homogeneous state are both stable . </S>",

    "<S> we expect that the dominant contribution to the cell s displacement over time will be the distance that it crawls while polarized ; when the cell is polarized , it contracts . </S>",
    "<S> we can then approximate the amplitude of periodic migration as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the cell center of mass velocity in the contraction phase , and @xmath86 the time required to contract from @xmath83 to @xmath82 . </S>",

    "<S> the cell must also grow while unpolarized for periodic migration to occur ; this condition depends on @xmath94 .    for the amplitude of periodic migration to become large , protrusion and retraction must be balanced so that @xmath95 is small . </S>",

    "<S> . however , our mechanism of periodic migration may be more general if cell polarization is coupled to other mechanical properties . </S>",
    "<S> cell - surface adhesion is a natural choice , as periodic motion arises in @xcite when the adhesion protein zyxin is depleted . </S>",
    "<S> if cells only polarize when sufficiently adherent to the surface , and this adhesion changes with cell motion , our periodic migration scheme may be recapitulated with adhesion in place of cell area .    </S>",
    "<S> periodic migration as observed in our simulations is a new , interesting , and tractable example of the complex dynamics resulting from coupling cell shape and polarity . </S>",
    "<S> periodic migration requires a balance between contraction and protrusion ( eq .  </S>",

    "<S> removing features or varying parameters ( appendix ) changes migration amplitude , but if the fundamental aspects illustrated by the 1d model are present , periodic migration exists . </S>",
