    "many biological processes involve the complexation between a charged macroion and an oppositely charged chain .",
    "a prominent example is the complexation of dna with histone proteins which is the basic step of dna compaction into chromatin in the cells of animals and plants  @xcite .",
    "complexation between macroions and synthetic polymers is also encountered in many technological applications as a means to modify macroion solution behavior ; examples are the complexation of polymers with charged colloidal particles  @xcite and charged micelles  @xcite .",
    "there is now a large body of theoretical studies on this set of problems , most of them have appeared within the last three years  @xcite ( cf . also earlier related studies  @xcite ) .",
    "they vary widely with respect to the methods and the level of approximations used and also with respect to the physical properties assumed for the chain and the macroion ",
    "the latter usually being modelled as a charged sphere .",
    "some studies  @xcite assume the chain to be so highly charged that counterion release is the dominant mechanism for the sphere - chain complexation , whereas most of the other studies assume weakly charged components attracted via standard electrostatics . in some cases",
    "the ball - chain complexes interact via a short - range attraction  @xcite corresponding to high ionic strengths  @xcite .",
    "the investigated systems also vary with respect to the chain flexibility : semiflexible chains are considered in refs .",
    "@xcite whereas the other studies assume flexible polymers .",
    "references  @xcite were devoted to the diffusion ( repositioning ) of the complexed sphere along the chain . and",
    ", finally , complexes between a chain and several spheres have been considered  @xcite .",
    "the space available here does not allow us to give a detailed account of the different approaches as well as of the phenomenons predicted like overcharging , conformational symmetries of the adsorbed chain etc .",
    "a critical survey will be provided in a topical review that is in preparation  @xcite .",
    "sphere - chain complexes have also been investigated in several computer simulations  @xcite .",
    "wallin and linse  studied the effect of chain flexibility  @xcite , line charge density  @xcite and sphere radius  @xcite on the geometry of a complex between a charged sphere and a polyelectrolyte in a monte carlo simulation that took counterions explicitly into account ; they also considered the case when there are many chains present  @xcite .",
    "chodanowski and stoll  @xcite investigated the adsorption of a flexible chain on a sphere assuming debye - hckel interaction .",
    "the case of multisphere adsorption on flexible  @xcite and semiflexible chains  @xcite was studied by jonsson and linse .",
    "messina , holm and kremer  @xcite demonstrated that in the case of strong electrostatic coupling it is even possible that a polyelectrolyte chain forms a complex with a sphere that carries a charge of the _ same _ sign  a phenomenon made possible by correlation effects due to neutralizing counterions .",
    "finally , a recent systematic study by akinchina and linse  @xcite focused again on the role of chain flexibility on the structure of the sphere - chain complex .",
    "the overall picture emerging from this multitude of theoretical and simulation studies is still not very clear .",
    "partly this has to be attributed to the fact that there are many free parameters determining the properties of the sphere - chain complex , especially the length of the chain , its linear charge density and persistence length , the macroion radius and charge and the screening length of the salt solution .",
    "this makes it difficult to develop a theory that covers the whole range of possible structures .",
    "the current study is an attempt to give a scaling theory that allows an approximate treatment of the chain - sphere complex over the whole range of parameters and that especially fills the gaps that were left open by the existing theories and simulations .",
    "it allows to identify the few independent scaling parameters in this system and leads to the construction of two - dimensional phase diagrams ( one for short and one for large screening lengths ) that cover the whole range of all the other parameters .",
    "this paper has been induced by a comparison of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . in the former paper we studied the complexation behavior of a semiflexible chain and a  sticky  sphere . in the context of electrostatics",
    "this corresponds to high salt concentrations where the debye screening length is much shorter than the sphere radius . in that paper",
    "we calculated the zero - temperature configurations modelling the polymer by the worm - like chain .",
    "we found two typical structures that occur in this system .",
    "if the sphere is sticky enough , i.e. , if the chain adsorption energy per length is large , the chain wraps around the sphere  as long as there is enough surface available . when the adsorption energy is decreased there is a point at which the bent chain unwraps in a strongly discontinuous fashion .",
    "the new structure that emerges has multiple point contacts between the sphere and the chain and large low - curvature loops connecting them .",
    "we called this class of structures the _ rosette _ configurations .    on the other hand , the latter work , ref .",
    "@xcite , presented a monte carlo study of the complexation of a semiflexible charged chain with an oppositely charged ball that carries the same absolute charge as the chain ( isoelectric complex ) .",
    "no small ions were present so that the charged monomers were attracted to the sphere via an unscreened long - range @xmath0-interaction .",
    "the authors simulated systems with different persistence lengths , linear charge densities of the chain and ball radii .",
    "depending on the choice of parameters they encountered a multitude of structures  ranging from collapsed structures with a  tennisball seam pattern  or solenoid arrangement of the wrapped chain  @xcite to open multi - leafed structures very much resembling the ones found in ref .",
    "their rosette structures occur for stiffer chains on smaller spheres .",
    "that work demonstrates that the rosette structure is quite robust with respect to the range of interaction . at the same time it also hints towards major differences between these two cases :",
    "the short - ranged case predicts clearly a strongly discontinuous unwrapping transition into large - leafed rosettes when the adsorption energy is decreased or the chain stiffness is increased  @xcite . in the simulation  @xcite , however , the rosette evolved continuously with increasing chain stiffness from a tightly wrapped state via slightly more open structures with many small loops to large - leafed rosettes",
    ".    how can one reconcile these findings ?",
    "for that purpose we reconsider in section ii the chain - sphere complexation for the case of short - ranged attraction  @xcite , formulating now the interaction in the language of strongly screened electrostatics instead of some short - ranged stickiness .",
    "then , in section iii , we give the scaling description in the case of weak screening . by focusing on the unwrapping transition we contrast the two cases in section iv . in the final section",
    "we compare our findings to computer simulations and experimental observations on the dna - histone complex .",
    "consider a polymer chain of length @xmath1 , radius @xmath2 and persistence length @xmath3 .",
    "the chain carries negative charges on its backbone  a distance @xmath4 apart  which leads to a linear charge density @xmath5 .",
    "the macroion is modelled as a sphere of radius @xmath6 that carries a positive charge @xmath7 .",
    "the reduced electrostatic potential is assumed to be smaller than unity everywhere so that the electrostatic interaction can be described by standard debye - hckel theory : two elementary charges at distance @xmath2 interact with the potential @xmath8 with @xmath9 ( @xmath10 : dielectric constant of the solvent , @xmath11 : thermal energy ) , the bjerrum length , and @xmath12 , the debye screening length for monovalent salt of concentration @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is of the order of @xmath15  in water at room temperature .    in this section",
    "we assume strong screening such that the screening length is much smaller than the radius of the ball , @xmath16",
    ". we will assume throughout the chain to be so thin that @xmath2 is the smallest length scale in our system , especially that always @xmath17 .",
    "the adsorption energy per length can then be estimated from the debye - hckel electrostatic potential close to the surface of the sphere which mimics for @xmath18 that of a plane with a surface charge density @xmath19 .",
    "one has then @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the distance from the surface ( cf .",
    ", for instance , ref .",
    "this leads to the following adsorption energy per length ( in units of @xmath11 ) @xmath22 now the chain will only wrap on the sphere when @xmath23 is large enough , namely so large that it exceeds @xmath24 , the bending energy per length  @xcite .",
    "the ( free ) energy of the wrapped chain - sphere complex is then given by @xmath25 this leads to the prediction of an unwrapping transition at @xmath26 when the chain stiffness @xmath27 is reached . since the wrapping path of the chain on the sphere can be quite intricate ( cf .",

    "( 35 ) coincides with eq .",
    "[ unwrap ] ) .    for larger persistence lengths than the one given in eq .",
    "[ unwrap ] the chain has to completely unwrap from the sphere .",
    "this led the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to the prediction of an  all - or - nothing  picture : either the chain is wrapped or it is unwrapped  with a single adsorption point or even completely desorbed .",
    "we showed however in a later study that the chain can lower its energy considerably by having multiple point contacts to the sphere which leads to the rosette structures  @xcite .",
    "let us call @xmath28 the energy per contact point ( in units of @xmath11 ) .",
    "its value @xmath29 follows from the length @xmath30 of a chain portion around a point contact that is located within the distance @xmath31 from the sphere .",
    "the free energy of an @xmath32-leafed rosette has then approximately the following form @xmath33 the first term describes the energy required to bend the @xmath32 chain pieces between the point contacts , each of length @xmath34 , into leaves with typical curvature @xmath34 , the second term account for the @xmath35 point contacts .",
    "we do not account here for the entropy of the chain configurations that can be safely neglected for large point contact energies @xmath36 ( see below ) .",
    "the optimal number of leaves follows from the minimization of the ( free ) energy to be @xmath37 which leads to leaves of size @xmath38 as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite each leaf minimizes its bending energy by assuming the shape of a so - called yamakawa - stockmayer ( ys ) loop , namely a lemniscate - shaped loop with an 81-degree apex angle  @xcite ( cf . also ref .",
    "@xcite for an approximate derivation of the ys loop ) . as a cautionary remark we mention that the bending energy of ys loops leads to the numerical prefactor 14.04 for the first term in eq .",
    "[ leaves1 ]  @xcite  clearly demonstrating that one should not extract from this theory any numbers but just scaling relations .",
    "the leaves show negligible shape fluctuations for @xmath39 , i.e. for @xmath36",
    ". then also @xmath40 , eq .  [ nstar ] , is essentially fixed and the rosette has a well - defined leaf number  as implicitely assumed here .    .",
    "depicted is the `` phase '' diagram as a function of the total length @xmath1 of the chain and of its persistence length @xmath41 divided by the point contact energy @xmath42 .",
    "the thick vertical bar denotes the discontinuous unwrapping transition . to the left",
    "are the wrapped complexes , to the right the rosettes.,width=302 ]    in fig .  1 we summarize our results in a  phase diagram  of total chain length @xmath1 vs. @xmath43 ( which is in the case of rosettes nothing but the leaf - size , cf .",
    "eq .  [ lleaf ] ) . for small values of @xmath44 we have wrapped structures , for large values rosette conformations .",
    "the unwrapping transition occurs at @xmath45 ( cf .",
    "[ unwrap ] and [ mu ] ) in a strongly discontinuous fashion indicated by a thick vertical line .",
    "the other lines indicate transitions between different ground states , namely rosettes with different numbers of leaves .",
    "additional features arise from the fact that the sphere surface is finite .",
    "as we will show now this can lead to the formation of tails for the case of wrapped structures and to the melting of rosettes .",
    "consider first a wrapped chain configuration , i.e. , assume some fixed value for @xmath46 , and increase @xmath1 , i.e. , go along a vertical line in the diagram , fig .",
    "it is clear that at a certain point the wrapping has to stop .",
    "locally the wrapped chain forms a nearly planar lamellar phase with a distance @xmath47 between neighboring chain sections .",
    "this distance follows from the competition between the chain - sphere attraction and the repulsion between neighboring chain segments  @xcite @xmath48 this leads to a wrapping length @xmath49 which is just the isoelectric wrapping length , the length at which the wrapped chain portion just compensates the sphere charge .",
    "chains that are shorter than this length , @xmath50 , will be completely wrapped , chains that are longer , @xmath51 , will have their extra length @xmath52 dangling from the complex in the form of one or two tails . the tail formation at @xmath53 has been indicated in fig .  1 by a horizontal dashed line",
    ". we also note that if @xmath54 in eq .",
    "[ dist ] , i.e. , if @xmath55 ( large sphere ) , the lamellar spacing is reduced to the value @xmath31 as pointed out by netz and joanny  @xcite .",
    "now let us consider the rosettes .",
    "choose some arbitrary value for @xmath56 and increase @xmath1 .",
    "then each time when the chain length is increased by an amount @xmath43 an additional leaf is formed .",
    "however , packing constraints imply an upper limit for the number of loops of the order @xmath57 ; this is the maximal number of contacts , each excluding an area @xmath58 , that can be closely packed on the surface of the sphere . for a rosette with the maximal number of leaves ( in fig .",
    "1 we chose arbitrarily @xmath59 ) an increase in @xmath1 leads to an increase of the leaf size .",
    "@xmath60 reaches the persistence length when @xmath61 . at that point melting of",
    "the rosette takes place , i.e. , for larger values of @xmath1 the leaf size distribution is heterogeneous , the ys loops show shape fluctuations and also the tails start to grow .",
    "entropic effects are then important .",
    "the thermodynamics of this melting process is quite intricate and can be calculated by mapping this problem on an exactly solvable one - dimensional many body problem  @xcite . in the current study",
    "we will not discuss the rosette melting further and merely indicate it in fig .  1 by an arrow pointing towards the direction of the @xmath1-axis .",
    "also shown in this figure is the direction where the chain desorption is to be expected .",
    "it should occur when the complexation free energy of the rosette , eq .",
    "[ leaves1 ] , becomes smaller than @xmath11 , i.e. for @xmath62 .",
    "the rosette configurations discussed in the last section occur for chains that are so stiff that wrapping would be too costly .",
    "it allows a small fraction of the chain to be close to the sphere in the form of point contacts .",
    "the majority of the monomers resides in the loops that do not  feel  the presence of the sphere but are needed to connect the point contacts via low curvature sections . at first sight one might thus expect the rosette configurations to be a special feature for chain - sphere complexes with a short ranged mutual attraction .    that this is not true",
    "has already been pointed out in the introduction . as observed in the simulations by akinchina and linse  @xcite rosettes",
    "are in fact quite robust and occur also in systems with a much larger range of interaction .",
    "we shall give now a scaling theory that provides us with a diagram of states for the chain - sphere complex for the case of weak screening , @xmath63 .",
    "we will first treat the case of short chains @xmath64 where the chain charge is smaller than ( or equals ) the sphere charge .",
    "the free energy of the rosette with @xmath32 leaves is then approximately given by @xmath65 the first term is the bending energy of @xmath32 leaves as already discussed after eq .",
    "[ leaves1 ] .",
    "the second term accounts for the attraction between the ball charge @xmath7 and the chain charge @xmath66 over the typical distance @xmath67 .",
    "all other contributions to the electrostatics like the monomer - monomer repulsion are smaller and neglected in eq .",
    "[ rosette1 ] .",
    "remarkably this free energy has the same form as the free energy  [ leaves1 ] of the rosette for short - ranged interaction .",
    "we just have to identify the point contact energy @xmath68 ( for the strong screening case ) with the single leaf - sphere interaction @xmath69 for the unscreened case .",
    "the optimal leaf number is thus again given by eq .",
    "[ nstar ] and the leaf size by eq .",
    "[ lleaf ] but now with @xmath68 given by eq .",
    "[ rosette2 ] .",
    "note that these scaling results remain even true if the leaves grow so large that their outer sections do not interact with the sphere due to screening , @xmath70 .",
    "this is so because the electrostatic rosette - sphere attraction still scales like @xmath71 : a fraction @xmath72 ( i.e. @xmath73 charges ) of each of the @xmath32 leaves interacts with the sphere at a typical distance @xmath74 .",
    "the rosette state competes with the wrapped state .",
    "we expect that the rosette state is _ continuously _ transformed into the wrapped state when @xmath75 ; then the leaves become so small that they touch with their contour the surface of the sphere .",
    "indeed , by setting @xmath76 in eq .",
    "[ rosette1 ] one finds @xmath77 which can be considered as the free energy of the wrapped state : the first term is the bending energy required to wrap the chain around the sphere and the second accounts for the electrostatic attraction between the wrapped chain and the sphere . all other electrostatic contributions ( as discussed in detail by nguyen and shklovskii  @xcite ) are less important and do not occur on this level of approximation . on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ rosette4 ] we arranged the terms in such way that one can deduce directly an unwrapping transition , namely at @xmath78 which can be rewritten as @xmath79 comparing eqs .",
    "[ fwrap ] and [ rosette4 ] one might expect that the chain unwraps in a strongly discontinuous fashion as discussed in the previous section . however , this ",
    "unwrapping point  corresponds just to the point @xmath80 when small loops start to grow on the sphere ; we thus expect the transition to be continuous as pointed out before eq .",
    "[ rosette4 ] . that the unwrapping transition occurs rather smooth at low ionic strength and in a strongly discontinuous way at high ionic strength has been predicted by netz and joanny  @xcite ; however , in that study the authors did not allow for rosette structures .    to complete the picture we finally have to consider chains that are longer than the isoelectric length , @xmath51 .",
    "we need then at least three terms to capture the essential physics of the rosette state : @xmath81 here we  allow  the monomers to distribute between the rosette of length @xmath82 and a tail of length @xmath83 .",
    "the first two terms in eq .",
    "[ rosette6 ] are then as above , eq .",

    "[ rosette7 ] , is minimized for the following number of leaves : @xmath87 hence  on this level of approximation ",
    "@xmath88 , i.e. , the rosette monomers just compensate the central ball charge ; the rest of the monomers extends away from the rosette in one or two tails of total length @xmath89 .",
    "each leaf is of size @xmath90 the rosette disappears for @xmath91 , i.e. , when eq .",
    "[ rosette5 ] is fulfilled .",
    "it is then replaced by a wrapped structure of length @xmath92 and one or two tails having the total length @xmath89 .    .",
    "the axes are chosen similar to fig .  1 with @xmath42 now being the leaf - sphere attraction in the rosette structures .",
    "the unwrapping is here rather smooth ( dashed vertical line ) .",
    "complexes with long chains , @xmath51 show tails.,width=302 ]    in fig .  2 we depict the complete diagram of the sphere - stiff chain complexes to be expected in the unscreened case .",
    "we again plot @xmath1 vs. @xmath43 , the leaf size .",
    "when one starts in this diagram at a large value of @xmath43 and goes towards smaller values of ( with some arbitrarily fixed value @xmath50 ) then all leaves shrink and more and more leaves can form . at @xmath93",

    "the chain wraps around the sphere . for long chains , @xmath51 ,",
    "the excess charges are accommodated in tails and all rosettes have the same length @xmath92 .",
    "the borderlines between different rosette ground states are then independent of the total length of the chain and thus appear as vertical lines .",
    "desorption occurs when the free energies , eqs .",
    "[ rosette1 ] and [ rosette6 ] , equal the thermal energy @xmath11 .",
    "this point is reached when @xmath95 for short chain , @xmath96 , and when @xmath97 for long chains , @xmath51 .",
    "we indicate in fig .  2 the direction where desorption occurs by an arrow .",
    "we take now a closer look at the unwrapping transition , contrasting the short- and the long - range case .",
    "the former case , @xmath18 , is depicted in fig .",
    "as discussed in section ii we expect the unwrapping transition to occur at @xmath98 which leads to eq .",

    "the dominant contribution to the complexation energy is then the release of counterions that were condensed on the sphere and on the chain before complexation .",

    "the chain is touching the sphere over some finite section ( similarly to the geometry discussed by netz and joanny  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , we predict @xmath148 by going from the reference system ( ii ) to this case .",
    "altogether , our scaling approach is in quite satisfactory agreement with the observations made in the monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "interesting would be to test our predictions also for chains that are shorter or longer than the isoelectric length .",
    "corresponding simulations are already on the way  @xcite    now we compare our scaling results with an experimental system , the nucleosome  @xcite .",
    "the wrapping of dna around protein spools , octamers of so - called histones , is the basic step in the condensation of dna into the dense chromatin complex inside the nuclei of plant and animal cells .",
    "each repeating unit of this complex , wrapped dna , histone octamer and a stretch of linker dna ( connecting to the next such protein spool ) is called nucleosome . when the linker is digested away the remaining complex ,",
    "the so - called nucleosome core particle , consists of 147 basepairs ( @xmath149 ) dna wrapped in 1-and-3/4 left - handed superhelical turns around the octamer .",
    "the core particle which has a radius of @xmath150  and a height of @xmath151  is documented in great detail on the basis of high - resolution x - ray analyses  @xcite .",
    "the histone octamer contains 220 basic side chains ( arginine and lysine )  @xcite . from these",
    "are about 103 located in flexible histone tails that dangle of the core particle and/or are complexed with the wrapped dna  @xcite .",
    "the rest , 117 residues , are in the globular part of the octamer , of which 31 are exposed to the solvent , the rest being involved in intra- and interprotein ionic interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "one has 147 bps of dna wrapped around the octamer , each contributing two phosphate groups .",
    "hence there are 294 negative charges from the dna versus 220 positive charges of the octamer , i.e. , the nucleosomal complex is overcharged by the dna .",
    "yager , mcmurray and van holde  @xcite characterized the stability of the nucleosome core particle as a function of the salt concentration ( nacl ) . using a variety of experimental methods ( e.g. gel electrophoresis ) they arrived at the following main conclusions :",
    "the core particle is stable for ionic strengths ranging from @xmath152 to @xmath153 ( this includes physiological relevant salt concentrations around @xmath154 ) . for slighly higher salt concentrations",
    "the dna is partially dissociated ; an equilibrium between histones , free dna and core particles is observed . at salt concentrations beyond @xmath155 the core particle",
    "is completely dissociated into histone oligomers and free dna . on the other end ,",
    "for very low salt concentration @xmath156 one finds an  expanded  state of the nucleosome .",
    "khrapunov et al .",
    "@xcite came via fluorescence measurements to similar conclusions : for ionic strengths between @xmath134 and @xmath157 the core particle is intact . at larger ionic strength ( @xmath158 )",
    "the terminal regions of the dna unwrap and two histone dimers are dissociated and at a even larger value ( @xmath159 ) the remaining tetramer leaves the dna .",
    "finally , at low salt concentrations one encounters an open state : the dimers break their contact with the tetramer and the dna termini unwrap .    the key features of the behavior of core particle dna ( neglecting the substructure of the octamer ) were recovered in a numerical study by kunze and netz  @xcite .",
    "they considered the complexation of a charged , semiflexible chain with an oppositely charged sphere , interacting via a screened debye - hckel potential .",
    "the optimal dna configuration was derived numerically from the minimization of the energy . for a reasonable set of parameters ( comparable to the one of the core particle ) they found for vanishing ionic strength ( @xmath160 ) an open , planar configuration where only a small fraction of the chain is wrapped whereas the two tails ( of equal length )",
    "are extended into roughly opposite directions .",
    "this is reminiscent of the open structures reported in the experimental studies  @xcite .",
    "upon addition of salt the structure goes from a two- to a one - tail configuration and the chain begins to wrap more and more . already well below physiological ionic strengths",
    "the chain is almost completely wrapped .",
    "the chain stays in this wrapped state up to very high salt concentrations .",
    "only then the chain unwraps in a discontinuous fashion when the chain - sphere attraction is sufficiently screened .",
    "also these features of the complex ( a wrapped compact state in a wide range around physiological conditions and unwrapping at high salt content ) reflect the experimental finding in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "how are these findings related to our scaling study ?",
    "let us start at physiological salt concentrations around @xmath154 .",
    "then @xmath161  is much smaller than the particle size @xmath162  and we have the short - range case .",
    "since @xmath163 , i.e. , @xmath164 for physiological conditions , and since the binding sites between dna and the histones are quite specific  @xcite , the estimation of @xmath23 in eq .",
    "[ lamda ] is not reliable .",
    "@xmath23 can be derived instead experimentally from competitive protein binding to nucleosomal dna  @xcite to be of the order @xmath165  which is roughly 10 times smaller than what eq .",
    "[ lamda ] would predict ( but note also that contact is made mainly between dna minor grooves which are 10 basepairs apart ! ) .",
    "this short - range attraction is largely balanced by the strong bending contribution ( @xmath136  for dna and hence @xmath166 ) . in any case , eq .",
    "[ unwrap ] predicts an unwrapping for sufficiently small values of @xmath167 but the numbers are not reliable .",
    "the more interesting case is that of the core particle at low ionic strength around @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) . at that salt concentration @xmath170 and we enter the long - range case .",
    "apparently , the completely wrapped configuration is not stable at this point anymore .",
    "this is not surprising since the nucleosomal dna overcharges the protein octamer by at least 74 negative charges ( if not by @xmath171 charges since 86 charged residues are buried inside the octamer ) .",
    "we thus expect a considerable part of the terminal dna to unwrap and to be part of one or two tails . in fig .  2",
    "this corresponds to the wrapped chain structures with tail that are found for small values of @xmath172 , @xmath94 , and large values of @xmath1 , @xmath51 .",
    "it would be interesting to redo the experiments with dna pieces that are longer than 147 basepairs .",
    "for sufficiently large salt concentrations there might be then the occurrence of rosettes ( if there is no interference with the partial disintegration of the octamer ) .",
    "for the other limit , it might be appropriate to use the argument for highly charged chains and spheres as given at the end of the previous section .",
    "the linear charge density of dna is very high ( 2 phosphate groups per base pair , i.e. , per 3.4 ) . manning theory  @xcite",
    "indeed predicts that counterion condensation reduces the linear charge density to @xmath173 with @xmath174 .",
    "also the charge of the histone octamer is so high that counterion condensation is important . for that case",
    "we predicted above the unwrapping to take place around @xmath175 .",
    "however , since the dna persistence length is smaller than @xmath176@xmath177  we expect the wrapped state to be stable at low ionic strength and no rosettes should occur in this limit .    concluding , we have presented a scaling theory for the complexation between a charged chain and an oppositely charged sphere for the two limits of high and low ionic strength . for strong screening",
    "one encounters with increasing chain stiffness a strongly discontinuous transition from a wrapped to an open multi - leafed rosette structure as already predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the case of",
    "weak screening one has again wrapped structures for sufficiently flexible chains and rosettes for stiffer chains . the unwrapping transition , however , is rather smooth in this case .",
    "that this is a characteristics of a system with long - ranged interaction has been further supported by extending this theory to power law attraction with arbitrary exponents and to the nonlinear limit of highly charged systems .",
    "we hope that the presented  phase diagrams  for the two cases are helpful for further theoretical and experimental studies ."
