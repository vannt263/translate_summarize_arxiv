    "although charmonium suppression was anticipated as a key signature of the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite , the suppression of @xmath8 mesons has been found to be relatively independent of beam energy from super proton synchrotron ( sps ) to relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) energies  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be attributed to @xmath8 regeneration by the recombination of uncorrelated @xmath9-@xmath10 pairs in the deconfined medium  @xcite that counterbalances the dissociation process .",
    "in addition , cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects , dissociation in the hadronic phase , and feed - down contributions from excited charmonium states and @xmath11 hadrons can alter the suppression pattern from what would be expected from debye screening .",

    "<S> the present measurement extends the number of participant nucleons in the collision ( @xmath7 ) by 20% compared to au+au collisions , and allows us to study a system with higher energy density . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a suppression in both the @xmath4 and @xmath6 yields in central u+u data , which consolidates and extends the previously observed suppression trend in au+au collisions . </S>"
