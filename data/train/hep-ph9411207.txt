    "non - decoupling effects of heavy particles in the low energy observables have been for a long time an indirect but crucial test for the discovery of new particles .",
    "the most recent example is the top quark , which contributes significantly to the observables that measure the electroweak ( ew ) radiative corrections , as for instance @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the latest global fit of the electroweak parameters from lep data gives a quite strong constraint for the allowed top mass value @xcite .",
    "this indirect search supports the recently announced evidence of @xmath1 production at cdf @xcite and will certainly contribute to get a final confirmation of the existence of the quark top .",
    "the non - decoupling effects of the higgs boson are , however , weaker than in the case of the top quark due to the screening theorem @xcite . according to this theorem ,",
    "the sensitivity in the low energy observables to the higgs boson mass is at most logarithmic at one loop .",
    "this fact has made in the past a difficult task to disentangle the higgs from the dominant fermionic effects and , therefore , no significant bound on the higgs mass has been obtained so far from the analysis of lep data .",
    "this situation , however , will likely improve in the near future due to the increasing precision of electroweak measurements and the forthcoming cdf data .",
    "a confirmation of the top quark is still needed , as well as a precise measurement of the top quark mass , but the important point is that it is now beginning to be plausible the search for evidence of the higgs boson in electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "on the other hand , regarding the theoretical aspects , the leading logarithmic higgs mass effects in the low energy observables are known up to one - loop level since the pioneering works by appelquist and bernard @xcite and by longhitano @xcite .",
    "their strategy was to use the symmetry properties of the @xmath2 gauged non - linear @xmath3-model ( gnl ) @xcite along with a systematic power - counting analysis to provide a list of these logarithmic higgs mass dependent terms .",
    "however , at present , it is known that these leading logarithmic terms are not sufficient to discriminate a heavy higgs possibility from an alternative symmetry breaking scenario to which one requires to respect the same sm symmetries .",
    "these logarithmic contributions are a consequence of the general gauge and custodial symmetry requirements of the low energy structure of ew interactions and therefore they will be the same irrespective of the particular choice for the breaking dynamics , with the higgs mass being replaced by some alternative physical mass .",
    "thus , if one wants to reveal the nature of the symmetry breaking from low energy observables , one has to go beyond the leading logarithmic effects .    in this paper , we present the complete calculation of the leading and next - to - leading non - decoupling effects of a heavy higgs boson in the sm to one loop level . these genuine higgs boson effects can not be obtained using the gnl as in @xcite , but must be calculated directly from the evaluation of the one loop diagrams in the sm .",
    "futhermore , in order to classify in a systematic way those effects , we will use here the electroweak chiral lagrangian ( echl ) @xcite .",
    "our approach is based on effective field theory methods , in which the non - decoupling effects of a heavy higgs boson are represented , at energies below the higgs mass , by certain set of gauge invariant effective operators of the echl .",
    "the echl is basically a non - linear sigma model coupled to the @xmath2 gauge fields , where the higgs field has been removed from the physical spectrum of the theory .",
    "the model respects the fundamental symmetries of the sm , namely @xmath2 gauge invariance spontaneously broken to @xmath4 and the custodial symmetry @xmath5 of the pure scalar sector , but does not include explicitely a particular dynamics for the symmetry breaking @xcite-@xcite .",
    "although this higgs - less parametrization of ew interactions is non - renormalizable , the theory can be rendered finite to one loop by adding gauge invariant operators up to dimension four .",
    "these effective operators parametrize the low energy effects of the underlying fundamental dynamics of the symmetry breaking .",
    "in particular , the echl can be regarded as an effective theory of the sm in which the higgs field has been integrated out , and its effects at energies well below the higgs mass are parametrized by the chiral effective operators @xcite .",
    "we believe that this kind of approach may be interesting for several reasons .",
    "first of all , it provides a gauge invariant way of separating the non - decoupling higgs boson effects from the rest of the ew radiative corrections . on the other hand ,",
    "the echl is a general framework in which one can analyze the low energy effects not only of a heavy higgs in the sm , but of more general breaking dynamics characterized by the absence of ligth modes @xcite .",
    "it is then desirable to have the echl that parametrizes a sm higgs as a fundamental reference model .    in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "we discussed a general procedure to obtain the echl operators by matching the sm predictions in the limit of large higgs mass with the predictions from the echl to one loop order .",
    "the subset of echl operators involved in the two and three - point green s functions of the gauge fields were also obtained there . in this work ,",
    "we complete the calculation of the echl operators by analyzing the four - point green s functions for gauge fields .",
    "we will also discuss here in more detail the relation between the renormalization of both the sm and the effective theory , which is crucial for understanding the true meaning of the effective operators .",
    "we will show with some explicit examples how to calculate observables in the echl parametrization of ew interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section two is a survey of the electroweak chiral lagrangian approach , in which we also include a brief discussion of the formal renormalization procedure of the effective theory and the matching conditions .",
    "section three is devoted to describe the computation of the sm four - point green s functions in the large @xmath6 limit .",
    "the renormalization prescription chosen for the sm is fixed in this section to be the on - shell scheme .",
    "the matching equations will be solved in section four where we present the results for the complete set of echl bare parameters .",
    "section five is devoted to discuss the dependence of the bare echl parameters on the renormalization prescription fixed for the underlying sm .",
    "we explain in section six the relation between the bare echl parameters and the renormalized echl parameters for different renormalizations of the effective theory . in section seven",
    "we explain how to compute observables to one loop with the echl and demonstrate by choosing some simple observables that the result agrees with previous calculations in the literature .",
    "finally , section eight is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "the echl is the most simple effective theory of ew interactions that parametrizes the physics of the @xmath2 breaking dynamics at low energies .",
    "the assumption made in this approach is that , whatever the @xmath2 breaking interactions may be , the particles involved in the symmetry breaking are heavier than the w and z bosons .",
    "the echl is then a low energy formulation of ew interactions which contains just the `` light '' gauge and would - be goldstone fields , satisfying the basic requirement of @xmath2 gauge invariance spontaneously broken to @xmath7 : @xmath8 its basic structure is a gauged non - linear sigma model @xmath9 , where a non - linear parametrization of the would - be goldstone bosons is coupled to the @xmath2 gauge fields @xmath10 + \\frac{1}{2}\\ ; tr\\left [ \\wtd \\wtu + \\btd \\btu \\right ] + \\cl_{\\rm r_\\xi } + \\fpnl , \\label{nll}\\ ] ] where the bosonic fields have been parametrized as @xmath11 and the covariant derivative and the field strength tensors are defined as @xmath12 \\wtd & \\equiv &   \\partial_\\mu \\wh_\\nu - \\partial_\\nu \\wh_\\mu - g [ \\wh_\\mu , \\wh_\\nu],\\nonumber\\\\[2 mm ] \\btd & \\equiv &   \\partial_\\mu \\bh_\\nu - \\partial_\\nu \\bh_\\mu . \\label{ften}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the physical fields are given by @xmath13 z_\\mu & = & c\\ ; w^3_\\mu - s\\ ; b_\\mu \\nonumber , \\\\[2 mm ] a_\\mu & = & s\\ ; w^3_\\mu + c\\ ; b_\\mu,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and the weak angle is defined by @xmath15 .",

    "we will work in a generic r@xmath32 gauge , the gauge fixing term @xmath33 and the faddeev - popov lagrangian @xmath34 in eq.([ecl ] ) were given in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to this work for the detailed formulas and a discussion on these terms .",
    "it is worth just recalling here that @xmath34 does not coincide with the usual faddeev - popov lagrangian of the sm due to the non - linearity of the would - be goldstone bosons under infinitesimal @xmath2 transformations .",
    "furthermore , because of the non - linear realization of the gauge symmetry , some of the couplings in @xmath9 have different feynman rules than in the sm .",
    "we collect in fig.(1 ) the subset of them that are relevant for the present calculation .",
    "it is also important to mention that in a r@xmath32 gauge , the complete electroweak chiral lagrangian must be brs invariant and include also effective operators involving the ghost fields .",
    "longhitano@xcite showed , however , that the subset of operators given above is sufficient to absorb the divergences of the gauged non - linear sigma model if the landau gauge is chosen .",
    "as it will be shown later , we have demonstrated in this work that the set of operators given in eq.([li ] ) is also enough , in a general r@xmath32 gauge , to render finite the two , three and four - point green s functions with external gauge fields .    the non - linear sigma model in eq.([nll ] ) is not a renormalizable theory , as increasing the number of loops in a calculation implies the appearence of new divergent structures of higher and higher dimension .",
    "however , the echl is an effective theory that can be renormalized order by order in the loop expansion . in particular , at one loop order , the new divergences generated by a one loop calculation with @xmath9 can be absorved into redefinitions of the effective operators given in eq.([li ] ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can obtain finite renormalized green s functions if one makes a suitable redefinition of the fields and parameters of the echl , among which the chiral parameters @xmath35 must be included @xcite- @xcite .",
    "formally , one defines the renormalized quantities in the effective theory by the following relations    @xmath36 \\vec{w}_\\mu^b \\ ; = \\ ;   \\widehat{z}_w^{1/2}\\ ; \\vec{w}_\\mu , &   g^b \\ ; = \\ ; \\widehat{z}_w^{-1/2}\\ ; ( g - \\widehat{\\delta g } ) , \\\\[2 mm ] \\vec{\\pi}^b \\ ; = \\ ; \\widehat{z}_\\phi^{1/2}\\ ; \\vec{\\pi } , & v^b \\ ; = \\ ; \\widehat{z}_\\phi^{1/2}\\ ; ( v -\\widehat { \\delta v}),\\\\[2 mm ] \\xi_b^b \\ ; = \\ ; \\xi_b\\ ; ( 1 + \\widehat{\\delta \\xi}_b ) , \\hspace{1 cm } & \\xi_w^b \\ ; = \\ ; \\xi_w \\ ; ( 1 + \\widehat{\\delta \\xi}_w ) , \\end{array}$ ] @xmath37    where the renormalization constants of the effective theory are @xmath38 and the superscript b denotes bare quantities .",
    "we use the hatted notation to distinguish counterterms and green s functions in the effective theory from the corresponding quantities in the sm .",
    "the 1pi renormalized green s functions of the effective theory to one loop will be generically denoted by @xmath39 where the superscript r denote renormalized function and the superscripts t , c and l denote the tree level , counterterm and loop contributions respectively .",
    "we will discuss in section 6 the on - shell renormalization of the effective theory , giving explicit expressions for the counterterms introduced in eq.([ret ] ) . for the moment , in order to discuss the matching procedure , we will treat the counterterm contributions to the renormalized functions of eq.([gfe ] ) just at a formal level .",
    "we would like to focus now our attention on the chiral parameters .",
    "once a particular renormalization scheme has been chosen to fix the counterterms of the effective theory , the renormalized @xmath40 parameters remain as free parameters that can not be determined within the framework of the low energy effective theory .",
    "the values of the renormalized chiral parameters can be constrained from the experiment , as they are directly related to different observables in scattering processes @xcite,@xcite-@xcite and in precision electroweak measurements ( @xcite-@xcite,@xcite , see also section 7 ) ; but to have any theoretical insight on their values , one has to relate the effective theory with a particular underlying fundamental dynamics of the symmetry breaking .",
    "if the underlying fundamental theory is the standard model with a heavy higgs , the chiral parameters can be determined by matching the predictions of the sm in the large higgs mass limit and those of the echl , at one loop level . by heavy higgs we mean a higgs mass much larger than any external momenta and light particle masses ( @xmath41 ) so that one can make a low energy expansion , but smaller than say 1 tev , so that a perturbative loop calculation is reliable .",
    "we will impose here the strongest form of matching @xcite by requiring that all renormalized one - light - particle irreducible ( 1lpi ) green s functions are the same in both theories at scales @xmath42 .",
    "the 1lpi functions are , by definition , the green s functions with only light particles in the external legs and whose contributing graphs can not be disconnected by cutting a single light particle line .",
    "this matching condition is equivalent to the equality of the light particle effective action in the two descriptions .",
    "some other forms of matching have been discussed in the literature , by requiring the equality of the two theories at the level of the physical scattering amplitudes @xcite or connected green s functions @xcite .",
    "these requirements , however , complicate the calculation unnecesarily while give at the end the same results for the physical observables .",
    "there is also some discussion in the literature @xcite on the dependence of the green s functions on the parametrization chosen for the would - be goldstone bosons .",
    "we will fix here the particular parametrizations of eq.([fpar ] ) in the effective theory and eq.([smpar ] ) in the sm .",
    "of course , the physical observables will not depend on this particular choice .    in order to completely determine the chiral parameters in terms of the parameters of the sm",
    ", it is enough to impose matching conditions in the two , three , and four - point 1lpi renormalized green s functions with external gauge fields .",
    "we have worked in a general r@xmath32-gauge to show that the chiral parameters @xmath35 are @xmath43-independent .",
    "we use dimensional regularization and the on - shell substraction scheme .",
    "the sm green s functions are non - local ; in particular , they depend on @xmath44 through the virtual higgs propagators .",
    "one has to make a large @xmath45 expansion to represent the virtual higgs boson effects by the local effective operators @xmath46 . in this step ,",
    "care must be taken since clearly the operations of making loop integrals and taking the large @xmath6 limit do not commute .",
    "thus , one must first regulate the loop integrals by dimensional regularization , then perform the renormalization with some fixed prescription ( on - shell in our case ) and at the end take the large @xmath6 limit , with @xmath6 being the renormalized higgs mass . from the computational point of view , in the large @xmath6 limit we have neglected contributions that depend on @xmath47 and/or @xmath48 and vanish when the formal @xmath49 limit is taken . we show in appendix a one illustrative example of how to take the large @xmath6 expansion of the loop integrals .",
    "the matching procedure can be summarized by the following relation among renormalized 1lpi green s functions @xmath50 where the large higgs mass expansion of the sm green s functions has to be made as explained above .",
    "this matching condition imposes a relation between the renormalization of the sm and the renormalization of the effective theory .",
    "we have chosen to renormalize both theories in the on - shell scheme , so that the renormalized parameters are the physical masses and coupling constants .",
    "therefore , the renormalized parameters are taken to be the same in both theories and the matching conditions will provide relations between the sm and the echl counterterms . ) in both theories has also been discussed . in that case",
    ", the matching procedure relates the running @xmath51-renormalized parameters , that are different in the fundamental and the effective theories . ]",
    "the matching condition ( [ match ] ) represents symbolically a system of tensorial coupled equations ( as many as 1lpi functions for external gauge fields ) with several unknowns , namely the complete set of parameters @xmath52 that we are interested in determining . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we solved the subset of coupled equations involving the two - point and three - point functions . from this subset",
    ", we were able to determine the chiral parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in section 4",
    ", we will solve the matching equations for the four - point green s functions , thus the set of echl parameters for a heavy higgs will be completed .",

    ", we should give now the whole set of renormalization conditions defining the sm on - shell scheme .",
    "however , to extract from the matching conditions the values of the chiral parameters @xmath35 , we only need for the moment to evaluate explicitely the sm counterterms that enter in the renormalization of the diagrams @xmath69 in figs.(3 ) , that is , the tree level diagrams with an intermediate higgs boson . furthermore",

    "the calculation of the one loop contributions @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the most involved part .",
    "one must include all the 1pi diagrams in the echl and all the 1lpi diagrams in the sm .",

    "one gets one equation `` per '' coefficient of the polinomial in each independent tensorial structure and in each green s function .",
