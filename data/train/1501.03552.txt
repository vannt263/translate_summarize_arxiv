    "the celebrated particle observed by the atlas @xcite and the cms @xcite collaborations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in july 2012 is mostly consistent with the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson than any other extensions of the sm @xcite , at least in terms of some statistical measures .",
    "the sm higgs boson was proposed in 1960s @xcite , but only received the confirmation recently through its decays into @xmath10 and @xmath11 modes .",
    "although the data on higgs signal strengths are best described by the sm , the other extensions are still viable options to explain the data .",
    "numerous activities occurred in the constraining the sm boson @xcite , higher dimension operators of the higgs boson @xcite , the two - higgs doublet models @xcite , and in the supersymmetric framework @xcite .",
    "a very recent update to all the data as of summer 2014 was performed in ref .",
    "we shall describe the most significant change to the data set in sec .",
    "iii . in this work ,",
    "we perform the fits in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) to all the most updated data on higgs signal strengths as of summer 2014 .    in our previous analysis of the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm )",
    "@xcite , we do not specify which neutral higgs boson is the observed higgs boson , so that the whole scenario can be described by a small set of parameters .",
    "the bottom and leptonic yukawa couplings are determined through the top yukawa coupling , and the @xmath12 coupling is determined via @xmath13 and top yukawa , so that a minimal set of parameters includes only @xmath13 and the top yukawa coupling .",
    "we can easily include the effects of the charged higgs boson by the loop factor in the @xmath2 vertex , and include possibly very light higgs bosons by the factor @xmath14 .",
    "here we follow the same strategy for the global fits in the framework of mssm , the higgs sector of which is the same as the type ii of the 2hdm , in order to go along with a minimal set of parameters , unless we specifically investigate the spectrum of supersymmetric particles , e.g. , the chargino mass .    in this work ,",
    "we perform global fits in the mssm under various initial conditions to the most updated data on higgs boson signal strengths .",
    "a few specific features are summarized here .    1",
    ".   we use a minimal set of parameters without specifying the spectrum of the susy particles .",
    "for example , all up- , down- and lepton - type yukawa couplings and the gauge - higgs coupling are given in terms of the top yukawa coupling , @xmath13 , and @xmath15 , where @xmath15 is the radiative correction in the bottom yukawa coupling defined later .",
    "effects of heavy susy particles appear in the loop factors @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 vertices , respectively .",
    "effects of additional light higgs bosons or light neutralinos that the 125.5 gev higgs boson can decay into are included by the deviation @xmath14 in the higgs boson width .",
    "4 .   cp - violating effects can occur in yukawa couplings , which are quantified by the cp - odd part of the top - yukawa coupling .",
    "effects of other cp sources can appear in the loop factor of @xmath1 and @xmath2 vertices .",
    "we label them as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have computed all the higgs - mediated cp - violating contributions to the electric dipole moments ( edms ) and compared to existing constraints from the edm measurements of thallium , neutron , mercury , and thorium monoxide . nevertheless , we are content with cp - conserving fits in this work .",
    "5 .   we impose the existing limits of chargino and stau masses when we investigate specifically their effects on the vertex of @xmath2 .",
    "the current limit on chargino and stau masses are @xcite @xmath20 similarly , the current limits for stop and sbottom masses quoted in pdg are @xcite @xmath21 which will be applied in calculating the effects in @xmath2 and @xmath1 vertices .",
    "note that the current lhc limits on the stop and sbottom masses are @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 gev at @xmath24% confidence level in a simplified model with @xmath25 gev  @xcite .",
    "however , there often exist underlying assumptions of search strategies and the mass of the lightest neutralino . therefore , we conservatively take the above mass limits on the stops and sbottoms in most of the analysis .",
    "since we shall try to find the implication of the current higgs signal strength data on the susy spectrum , which in practice affects the lightest higgs boson mass , we therefore also calculate the corresponding higgs boson mass and impose the current higgs mass constraint of @xmath26 gev , taking at a roughly @xmath27-@xmath28 level .",
    "the organization of the work is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the convention and formulas for all the couplings used in this work . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe various cp - conserving fits and present the results . in sec .",
    "iv , we specifically investigate the susy parameter space of charginos , staus , stops , and sbottoms .",
    "we put the synopsis and conclusions in sec . v.",
    "for the higgs couplings to sm particles we assume that the observed higgs boson is a generic cp - mixed state without carrying any definite cp - parity .",
    "we follow the conventions and notation of cpsuperh  @xcite .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm is essentially the same as the type ii of the 2hdm .",
    "more details of the 2hdm can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the mssm ,",
    "the first higgs doublet couples to the down - type quarks and charged leptons while the second higgs doublet couples to the up - type quarks only .",
    "after both doublets take on vacuum - expectation values ( vev ) we can rotate the neutral components @xmath29 and @xmath30 into mass eigenstates @xmath31 through a mixing matrix @xmath32 as follows : @xmath33 with the mass ordering @xmath34",
    ". we do not specify which higgs boson is the observed one , in fact , it can be any of the @xmath31 .",
    "we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the bottom and lepton yukawa couplings can be expressed in terms of the top yukawa coupling in general 2hdm .",
    "we can therefore afford a minimal set of input parameters .",
    "the effective lagrangian governing the interactions of the neutral higgs bosons with quarks and charged leptons is @xmath35 at the tree level , @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , and @xmath40 is the ratio of the vevs of the two doublets .",
    "threshold corrections to the down - type yukawa couplings change the relation between the yukawa coupling @xmath41 and mass @xmath42 as and @xmath43 are usually the same , but @xmath44 could be very different because of the third generation squarks . however , our main concern in this work is the third - generation yukawa couplings .",
