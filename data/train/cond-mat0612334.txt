    "we present a fokker - planck formulation for the full problem including both thermalized initial condition and reversal orbit with estimates for the reversal time and its distribution .",
    "fokker - planck equations have been successfully applied to macro - spin systems with a static thermal distribution for the extraction of a small thermal escape probability .",
    "for example , the distribution for a thermally activated reversal has been analytically and numerically obtained when the applied magnetic field is smaller than the coercive field @xcite . there",
