    "we note that these edge modes are predicted by the mirror chern number in the bulk .",
    "these results demonstrate that six pairs of majorana modes are protected by the symmetry because a phase with the mirror chern number @xmath265 is topologically equivalent to a phase having two pairs of helical majorana modes predicted by the mirror chern number @xmath266 in the bulk . besides that , the chiral majorana modes and odd number of helical majorana modes are robust against interactions@xcite .",

    "<S> in addition , ( ii ) finite temperature effects can restore the gapless edge modes for @xmath87 , in contrast to the case of @xmath131 , because the chern numbers are still well - defined with the green s function and take nontrivial values even when the gapless edge modes are destroyed at zero temperature , provided that the perturbation expansion of the green s function in terms of interactions still works .    _ </S>",
    "<S> -summary- _ in this paper , we have proposed the @xmath0 superlattice as a possible experimental test bed for the reduction of the topological classification in free fermion systems . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis has elucidated the following results : in the presence of two - body interactions , the classification for the topological crystalline superconductor at the non - interacting level , @xmath2 , collapses into @xmath3 , and helical edge modes in the quad - layer system are completely gapped out in the presence of two - body interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the number of @xmath1 layers is essential for detecting the reduction ; the minimum number of @xmath1 layers for the reduction is four . besides that </S>",
