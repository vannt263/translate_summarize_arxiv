    "at present , most physical problems of interest can be solved neither exactly nor in terms of the canonical perturbation theory ( cpt ) , therefore a considerable attention is given to the development of methods of nonperturbative analysis of quantum systems ( see , e.g. , review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of such methods , called the operator method ( om ) of approximate solution of schrdinger equation , proved to be very effective .",
    "the om was presented in @xcite and approved for a number of physical problems including those with many degrees of freedom @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the main advantages of the om are defined by the fact that its zeroth order approximation allows one to calculate the hamiltonian eigenvalues and eigenvectors with rather high accuracy in the entire range of both the hamiltonian parameters and quantum numbers of the states . besides , the further approximations of the om lead to the sequences converging to the exact solutions .",
    "however , most of the particular applications of the om have been considered before for the systems in pure  quantum states .",
    "the nonperturbative methods are of great interest also in quantum statistics , when calculating thermodynamic characteristics of quantum systems .",
    "these characteristics can be expressed through either the partition function or the free energy of a system .",
    "most of known nonperturbative methods in quantum statistics are based feynman path integrals ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . however , an alternative representation of the partition function based on the direct summation over the energy states is also important because it could be more convenient and descriptive for some applications , especially in the atomic and molecular physics when the system is characterized by a large but finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , the additional procedure of bosonization is necessary when the functional integrals are used for the spin systems , and that leads to complication of the real hamiltonian ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize the om for the nonperturbative calculation of the thermodynamic values in quantum statistics with the schrdinger representation for quantum systems .",
    "a specific feature of this problem in comparison with application of the om for `` pure '' quantum states is that the partition function is defined by an energy spectrum as a whole and include the summation over all states . as a result , the accuracy of calculation of the thermodynamic values for some temperature interval can be rather low even in the case when the hamiltonian eigenvalues are found with high precision ( see example in sec.2 ) .",
    "therefore we should analyze whether the om accuracy for the spectral problem @xcite ensures the calculation of the thermodynamic values in the entire temperature range .",
    "besides , some additional procedure should be developed for approximate summation over the states .",
    "it is shown in the paper that the regular nonperturbative method for calculation of the thermodynamic values can be developed on the basis of the om combined with the cumulant expansion ( ce ) @xcite . in order to approve our approach and compare it with other approximate methods ,",
    "the boltzmann diatomic molecular gas is considered and the partition function and the free energy corresponding to the molecular internal degrees of freedom are calculated .",
    "it is shown for some particular examples that the zeroth order approximation of the proposed method leads to the uniformly suitable estimation for the thermodynamic values in the entire range of both temperature and hamiltonian parameters . the systematic procedure for calculation of the consequent approximations",
    "is also considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we discuss some general definitions of uniformly suitable estimation that concerns any nonperturbative approach . the procedure for nonperturbative calculation of the hamiltonian eigenvalues on the basis of the operator method is described in sec.3 as the first part of the proposed approach .",
    "the approximate summation over the states by means of the cumulant expansion is considered in sec.4 as the second part of our method . in order to approve this expansion , the analytical formula for interpolation of the rotational partition function of the diatomic molecular gas",
    "is obtained in the same section on the basis of the method proposed . in sec.5",
    "we use our approach for calculation of the partition function and the free energy for an equilibrium system of the anharmonic oscillators and compare the calculated values with the results of other methods .",
    "the obtained results are of interest not only as the approval of the considered method , but also for the description of thermodynamic characteristics of real molecular systems when anharmonic effects should be taken into account .",
    "it is well known that if the hamiltonian of some quantum system includes a small parameter , the regular procedure of calculation of the observable characteristics of this system can always be constructed in the form of a power series in this parameter .",
    "for example , it can be the canonical form of the perturbation theory with expansion in a power of small coupling constant ( @xmath0 ) ; an expression as powers in @xmath1 for the strong coupling limit ; a series in terms of powers of @xmath2 in the quasi - classical approximation ; low- or high - temperature expansions for thermodynamic values .",
    "however , in most cases these expansions are the asymptotic ones , and hence can not be used directly in a wide range of the hamiltonian parameters . on the contrary ,",
    "the main goal of the nonperturbative methods is to calculate physical characteristics of a system in the entire range of its parameters .",
    "further in the paper , when we refer to the nonperturbative calculation of some physical values , we assume that either there is no small parameter in the system , or its value lies out of the domain of applicability of the asymptotic expansions @xcite - @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to define the concept of the `` uniformly suitable estimation '' ( use ) in this case .",
    "let us consider some physical variable with eigenvalues @xmath3 depending on the quantum number @xmath4 and the physical parameter @xmath5 ( the totality of the parameters and quantum numbers are implied for systems with many degrees of freedom ) .",
    "let us introduce    * definition 1 * : the function @xmath6 is the use for @xmath7 if the following inequality holds in the entire range of variation of the values @xmath4 and @xmath8    @xmath9    here the parameter @xmath10 is assumed to be independent of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and defines the accuracy of the use .",
    "we also consider    * definition 2 * : there are the sequence of functions @xmath11 and the method for their calculation corresponding to the decreasing sequence of the parameters @xmath12 , so that    @xmath13    it seems that definition 1 is not constructive because the exact values @xmath7 are unknown in general case . however , there are several possibilities to estimate the value @xmath14",
    ". in particular , one can compare the asymptotic series for @xmath7 in various limit cases either of the parameter @xmath8 or of the quantum number @xmath4 with the corresponding expansions of the function @xmath6 taking into account that inequality ( [ 1 ] ) should hold for all cases simultaneously .",
    "besides , an estimation for @xmath14 can be found as the difference between @xmath15 and @xmath6 .",
    "for example , we can refer to the use for the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian calculated for various physical systems in pure  states on the basis of the om @xcite - @xcite .",
    "considerable advantage of the use for various applications in comparison to the asymptotic expansions is the possibility to investigate the qualitative peculiarities of the quantum system in the intermediate range of the parameters connected with hamiltonian and the external conditions . at the same time ,",
    "rather high precision of the use in the zeroth order is of great use for practical calculations and it defines the rate of convergence of the consecutive approximations to the exact solution .    let us consider from this point of view the thermodynamic perturbation theory in the schrdinger representation of the quantum statistics .",
    "usually it is formulated for the free energy of the system @xcite and the leading terms are the following    @xmath16 + \\cdots .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here we have introduced @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the temperature and @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the exact and approximate free energies respectively ; @xmath22 are the eigenvalues of the unperturbed hamiltonian and @xmath23 are the matrix elements of the perturbation operator with the following form of the total hamiltonian    @xmath24    and @xmath25}$ ] is the unperturbed density matrix",
    ".    any partial sum of this series does not yield the free energy in the whole range of the temperature and the perturbation parameter @xmath26 even in the simplest cases .",
    "let us illustrate this by means of the model hamiltonian used earlier in @xcite for the convergence analysis of a usual perturbation series for pure  states    @xmath27 } ; \\nonumber \\\\ v_{mn } = ( n + \\frac{1}{2})\\delta_{m , n } + \\frac{1}{2}[\\sqrt{(n+1)(n+2 ) } \\delta_{m , n+2 } + \\sqrt{n(n-1 ) } \\delta_{m , n-2 } ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 is the kroneker symbol .",
    "certainly , the exact free energy is well - known for this model ( @xmath29}$ ] ) but if we use these matrix elements in formula ( [ 3 ] ) , then rather simple calculation leads to the following result    @xmath30 } + \\frac{\\mu}{2}% \\coth{\\frac{\\beta}{2 } } -   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\mu^2}{8}[1 + \\coth{\\frac{\\beta}{2 } } + \\frac{1}{2\\sinh^2{\\frac{\\beta}{2% } } } ( 1 + 2\\beta ) + \\cdots].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is evident that this series does not satisfy the use criteria with respect to both essential parameters of the system . in the low temperature limit ( @xmath31 ) ,",
    "formula ( [ 6 ] ) leads to the power series of @xmath26 for the ground state energy and this series diverges in the range of @xmath32 because of a singular point of the exact eigenvalue @xmath33 in the complex plane of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , definition 1 breaks also for the free energy dependence on the parameter @xmath34 .",
    "when the temperature increases ( @xmath35 ) , the second order correction has a stronger singularity ( @xmath36 ) than the exact free energy .",
    "thus , our objective is to formulate another regular method , different from ( [ 3 ] ) , which allows us finding the use for the free energy of a quantum system with an arbitrary energy spectrum @xmath37 .",
    "as mentioned above , in order to obtain the use for the partition function one has to solve two problems : 1 ) to find such an approximate representation for the energy levels of a system under consideration , which holds in the whole range of the hamiltonian parameters , and 2 ) to perform approximate summation on quantum numbers so that the result remains uniformly suitable with any temperature . for the former purpose we shall use the operator method ( om ) of approximate solution of schrdinger equation .",
    "this method is described in details in review paper @xcite .",
    "let us consider here only the basic expressions defining the consecutive approximations of the om for the eigenvalues @xmath37 and eigenvectors @xmath38 of a hamiltonian @xmath39 of some quantum system ( the index @xmath4 may involve the whole set of quantum state numbers )    @xmath40    let us introduce the complete set of state vectors @xmath41 , depending on the same quantum numbers and arbitrary parameters @xmath42 . in the canonical perturbation theory ( cpt ) the eigenfunctions of some part @xmath43 of the full hamiltonian ( zeroth order approximation hamiltonian )",
    "are used as such a complete set .",
    "the schrdinger equation for that part is assumed to be exactly solvable . in terms of the om ,",
    "the vectors @xmath41 are considered as a set of variational wave functions .",
    "thus , the choice of these vectors is rather arbitrary and is defined by qualitative features of the system under consideration and by the possibility of rather simple calculation of the matrix elements of the total hamiltonian @xmath39",
    ". then we can represent the solution of equation ( [ 61 ] ) in the form of expansion    @xmath44    and choose the normalization of the exact solution as the following    @xmath45    as a result , the initial eigenvalues problem ( [ 61 ] ) exactly reduces to the system of infinite number of nonlinear algebraic equations for @xmath37 and coefficients @xmath46 @xcite    @xmath47^{-1 } \\bigl[h_{mn } + \\sum_{k \\not= m , n } c_{nk } h_{mk}\\bigr ] ; \\quad m \\not= n.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as shown in @xcite , the most effective method for solving this system of equations is an iterative scheme , in which the exact solutions are calculated as the limit of the sequences ( and not by summation of series , as in the cpt )    @xmath48    and the consecutive approximations in ( [ 65 ] ) are calculated by means of recurrence relations    @xmath49^{-1 } \\bigl[h_{mn } + \\sum_{k \\not= m , n } c^{(s-1)}_{nk } h_{mk}\\bigr ] ;   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "e^{(0)}_n = e^{(1)}_n = h_{nn } ; \\quad c^{(0)}_{nk } = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as shown for various physical systems @xcite - @xcite , recurrence relations ( [ 66 ] ) rapidly converge to the exact solutions , and the choice of the parameter @xmath42 influences only the rate of this convergence . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves with expressions for the energy after the second iteration ( the first one coincides with the zeroth order approximation by definition ) , as we are interested mainly not in strict numerical calculations , but in constructing of the use for the eigenvalues , the partition function and the free energy .",
    "the second iteration leads to the following approximation    @xmath50^{-1 } h_{nm}h_{mn}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    strictly speaking , this expression is suitable if the diagonal matrix elements    @xmath51 for the considered value of the parameter @xmath52 and for all states from the set @xmath53 in expansion ( [ 62 ] ) .",
    "if for some concrete values m and @xmath54    @xmath55 one should extract the state @xmath56 from expansion ( [ 62 ] ) and solve the secular equation in the om zeroth order approximation analogously to the canonical perturbation theory in case of degenerate states @xcite .",
    "some applications of the om for physical systems with such features were considered in papers @xcite , @xcite .    for systems with several degrees of freedom the state vector @xmath57 in equation ( [ 61 ] )",
    "may also depend on some additional index @xmath58 .",
    "the energy level @xmath59 is supposed to be independent of this index .",
    "actually it means that the wave function is also the eigenvector of some operator    @xmath60 = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "as shown in paper @xcite , in such a case the projection operator @xmath61 for the state with fixed quantum number @xmath58 should be used in series ( [ 62 ] ) in order to solve both equations ( [ 61 ] ) and ( [ 67a ] ) simultaneously .",
    "it leads to unessential modification of recurrence equations ( [ 66 ] ) but does not change the properties of the om consecutive approximations .    in this paper",
    "the generalization of the om for quantum statistics is of main interest and thus we shall not consider the above mentioned more complicated systems .    in spite of the formal similarity of formula ( [ 67 ] ) and the expression obtained in the second order of the cpt ( see formula ( [ 3 ] ) ) , the former one maintains some essential differences .",
    "first , the matrix elements of the operator @xmath39 are calculated with the set of state vectors @xmath62 for the whole hamiltonian ( and not for its unperturbed part as in the cpt ) . according to @xcite , this circumstance is essential for the convergence of the consequent approximations of the om .",
    "in particular , this convergence depends on the numerical dimensionless parameter , defined by the ratio of the diagonal and nondiagonal matrix elements of the total hamiltonian    @xmath63    this value is independent of the physical parameters of the hamiltonian and defines both the convergence of the consequent approximations of the om , and the accuracy of the use for the zeroth order approximation of the om @xcite in accordance with definition 1 .",
    "another specific feature of approximation ( [ 67 ] ) is that it depends on some undefined parameter @xmath42 , which should be chosen so that to provide the best accuracy of the use in the zeroth order approximation of the om .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , that the best zeroth order approximation of the om for the energy level with the quantum number @xmath4    @xmath64    is achieved when @xmath65 is chosen as the solution of the equation    @xmath66    it should be underlined , that equation ( [ 69 ] ) is not the variational principle for the excited states .",
    "the point is that the artificial parameter @xmath42 defines actually the representation for the wave functions , and hence , the exact eigenvalues of the hermitian hamiltonian should not depend on its choice .",
    "the exact condition is    @xmath67    therefore , equation ( [ 69 ] ) can be considered as the om zeroth order approximation for the exact condition ( [ 70 ] ) .",
    "it is essential that the optimal value of the parameter @xmath68 depends on the quantum number of the considered state .",
    "this means that the orthonormal set of basic vectors used in expansion ( [ 62 ] ) should be chosen for every state in different ways . as a result ,",
    "the consecutive approximations of the om ( [ 66 ] ) have local  character in the space of quantum numbers , i.e. , they are calculated independently with different sets of state vectors for every state of the system . on the contrary , in terms of the cpt",
    "the corrections for all quantum numbers are defined by the same spectrum and basic state vectors of the unperturbed hamiltonian .    in this paper",
    "we use model physical systems in order to illustrate the applicability of the om in statistical physics .",
    "in particular , let us consider the quantum anharmonic oscillator ( qao ) with the hamiltonian    @xmath69    it is well known , that the cpt expansion for this system has zero radius of convergence with respect to the parameter @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the qao is widely used for approbation of various nonperturbative methods , and all approximations can be compared with the detailed numerical analysis of this problem in @xcite . in the problem of the qao the most adequate choice of the full set of state vectors for the om algorithm is the set of eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator with an arbitrary frequency , playing a role of the parameter @xmath42 .",
    "at the same time , it is convenient to perform all the necessary calculations of the matrix elements in an algebraic form , using the representation of the secondary quantization @xcite . in such a case",

    "one can see that only approximation for the functions @xmath76 obtained in terms of the om does satisfy the definition ( [ 1 ] ) for the use approximated energy levels of the qao .",

    "it should be pointed out , that for single - dimensional systems the latter problem is less important .",
    "it is sufficient to use expression ( [ 67 ] ) for the energy levels , obtained in terms of the om , to derive the use for thermodynamic values and to carry out direct numerical summation ( see below ) in ( [ 8a ] ) .",
