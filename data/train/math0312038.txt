    "<S> of such wavelets , the easiest to describe are the haar wavelet and the shannon wavelet in @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> the theory also unifies both lang s and kozyrev s wavelets within a much broader setting .    besides identifying haar and shannon wavelets in this context , </S>",
    "<S> the main purpose of this paper is to give examples of some of the groups and constructions considered in @xcite in an expository setting . in section  [ sect : motiv ] , we present a concrete example of a haar / shannon wavelet , in the cantor dyadic group @xmath6 . </S>",
