    "the value of the microlensing optical depth toward the galactic bulge field has been evolved with the refinement of both experimental measurements and theoretical predictions . @xcite and @xcite first predicted the optical depth of @xmath4 assuming all events were caused by known disk stars .",
    "however , the first measurement of the optical depth of @xmath5 reported by ogle @xcite was significantly higher than the earlier predictions .",
    "this prompted @xcite to evaluate the lens contribution of bulge stars in addition to disk stars .",
    "soon after , optical depths based on more refined models of the galactic bulge were suggested by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "the values of the new predictions were in the range of @xmath6 , but these values still fall systematically below the measurements by ogle and macho @xcite .    to reconcile the predictions and measurements ,",
    "various explanations were suggested .",
    "a set of these explanations suggested new populations of events .",
    "@xcite pointed out non - negligible contribution of disk self - lensing events .",
    "@xcite indicated that disk source stars behind the bulge has much higher optical depth than bulge stars , and thus although they are a very small fraction of the stars in the baade s window , they can contribute @xmath7 of the optical depth .",
    "@xcite pointed out similar contribution of events associated with source stars belonging to the sagittarius dwarf galaxy .",
    "@xcite mentioned the possibility of events caused by lenses in an inner ring located roughly halfway between the observer and bulge .",
    "another set of explanations pointed out potential biases in the optical depth measurements .",
    "one of such biases is the the `` magnification - bias effect '' @xcite , pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the bulge is very crowded field and thus the images of stars suffer from severe blending . for efficient processing of images taken toward such a crowded field ,",
    "earlier lensing experiments registered bright resolved stars on a template image and monitored the brightness variation of only these stars . for such experiments , although a source star is fainter than the detection limit imposed by crowding and thus not registered , it is still possible to detect an event if the star is located close to the seeing disk of a bright registered star .",
    "the optical depth is measured based on the number of monitored stars , @xmath8 , by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total observation time , @xmath11 is the total number of detected events , @xmath12 are the einstein timescales of the individual events , and @xmath13 is the detection efficiency of events as a function of @xmath14 . then , if these faint source stars are not taken into consideration , the number of source stars effectively monitored by the survey is systematically underestimated , and thus the optical depth is overestimated .",
    "observational efforts to refine the optical depth measurements were focused also on blending .",
    "one simple but efficient method for the accurate determination of the optical depth was measuring @xmath0 based on events associated with only clump giant ( cg ) source stars , because these bright bulge stars are not strongly affected by blending .",
    "four optical depth measurements based on cg - associated events were reported by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these values range @xmath15 , approaching close to the theoretical predictions .",
    "another effort of minimizing the blending effect was the adoption of a new photometry technique that measures the source star flux variation on images obtained by subtracting observed images from a seeing - convolved reference image @xcite . by suing the dia method",
    ", one can improve the photometry of events because the measured flux variation is not affected by blending .",
    "the optical depth measurements by using this so called `` difference image analysis '' ( dia ) method based on all events with source stars down to the detection limit were published by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these estimates range @xmath16 , and thus they are systematically greater than the estimates based on cg stars and the theoretical predictions .    prompted by the difference between the optical depth estimates based on cg stars and the dia result , we investigate the effect of unresolved binary companions to source stars on the microlensing optical depth determination . due to the characteristics of the dia photometry ,",
    "a significant fraction of events are associated with faint source stars which could not be identified by the traditional dophot @xcite .",
    "therefore , estimation of the optical depth based on the dia photometry requires consideration of faint stars effectively working as source stars to lensing . in the previous dia estimates",
    ", this has been done based on a luminosity function ( lf ) obtained by using high - resolution instruments such as the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) .",
    "however , companions to source stars can not be resolved even with the _ hst _ , and thus the contribution of the companions to the effective number of source stars has _ not _ been taken into consideration in the previous optical depth estimations . considering that majority of stars",
    "have companions @xcite , the fraction of events associated with companion stars might not be negligible and could explain a significant fraction of the gap between the optical depth estimates based on cg stars and the dia results .",
    "let us think about an event occurred on a companion star whose image is blended with that of its brighter primary star .",
    "the separation between the primary and companion stars is , in general , much larger than the einstein ring radius of a typical galactic bulge event caused by a low - mass star of @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of the lens , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the distances to the lens and source , respectively .",
    "then , the primary star , in most cases , is not participating in the lensing magnification and thus it simply works as a blending source @xcite . in this case , the apparent magnification of the event is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the true magnification of the event occurred on the companion star , @xmath23 is the lens - source ( companion star ) angular separation in units of the angular einstein ring radius @xmath24 , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the fluxes of the primary and companion stars , respectively .",
    "the true magnification is related to the normalized lens - source separation @xmath23 by @xmath27    although the image of a companion star is blended , the event associated with the companion star can be detected if its flux is magnified highly enough to make the apparent magnification of the combined flux of the primary and companion higher than a threshold value . due to blending",
    ", the threshold magnification for the event detection becomes higher .",
    "the increase threshold magnification is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the threshold magnification without blending .",
    "then , the threshold lens - source separation ( impact parameter ) corresponding to the increased threshold magnification is @xmath30^{1/2 } , \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] implying that as long as the lens approaches the companion star closer than @xmath31 , the event associated with the companion can be detected .",
    "therefore , companions can work effectively as source stars to lensing and thus the events associated with them should be taken into consideration in the optical depth determination .",
    "then , how much is the contribution of events associated with companion stars to the total optical depth , @xmath32 , toward the galactic bulge field . for this estimation , we compute the ratio of the number of events associated with companions , @xmath33 , to the total number of events , @xmath11 . the optical depth is related to the mass distribution along the line of sight toward the observation field , while the event rate is additionally dependent on the mass function of the lens matter .",
    "however , since the lens does not discriminate whether the source star is primary or companion , the optical depth contribution of the companion - associated events is equivalent to their contribution to the total event rate , i.e.  @xmath34 .",
    "lcc current - type & @xmath35 & @xmath36 + future space - based & @xmath37 & @xmath38 +    we estimate @xmath39 as follows .",
    "first , we assume that companions follow the same lf as that of primary stars @xcite . with this assumption",
    ", we assign the brightnesses of the primary and companion source stars based on the binary - corrected @xmath40-band lf of stars in the solar neighborhood listed in @xcite .",
    "once each pair of the primary and companion stars is produced , we then calculate the threshold magnification @xmath41 required for the event detection and the corresponding threshold impact parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the number of events having magnifications higher than @xmath42 is directly proportional to @xmath43 because the distribution of events is uniform in impact parameter .",
    "then , the contribution of the companion - associated events to the total event rate is computed by @xmath44 where @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 is the total number of monitored source primaries that would have produced events in the absence of binarity , @xmath3 is the binary frequency , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 represent the threshold impact parameters of the events associated with the primary and companion , respectively .",
    "we note that the event associated with the primary star is also affected by blending caused by the flux from the companion star , and thus @xmath50 and @xmath51 . for the computation of the threshold impact parameter , we assume that events are detected when @xmath52 adopting the conventional threshold magnification .",
    "we also assume that the combined ( primary plus companion ) brightness of the source star monitored by the current surveys is in the range of @xmath53 . with the distance modulus of @xmath54 and extinction of @xmath55",
    ", this range corresponds to the apparent magnitude range of @xmath56 . as the brightness of the monitoring source star decreases , the relative companion / primary flux ratio increases , and thus the rate of the companion - associated events increases .",
    "the future space - based lensing survey using the _ galactic exoplanet survey telescope _",
    "( _ gest _ ) mission proposed by @xcite plans to monitor faint main - sequence stars to optimize the detections of terrestrial planets by minimizing finite - source effect . to examine the dependence on the source star brightness",
    ", we also estimate the fraction of the companion - associated events from this future survey to examine the effect of source star brightness . for this estimation , we assume that the range of the source star brightness is @xmath57 , which corresponds to early f to late k - type main - sequence stars .    in tabel  [ table1 ] , we present the estimated contribution of the companion - associated events to the total event rate expected from the current and future lensing surveys . in figure",
    "[ fig : one ] , we also present the lfs of the primary and companion source stars effectively participating in lensing ( _ effective luminosity function _ ) , where the companion lf is for the case @xmath58 to show the possible maximum contribution of the companion - associated events .",
    "the result says that the contribution of the companion - associated events is @xmath59 for the current lensing surveys and it is slightly higher values of @xmath2 for the future lensing survey .",
    "therefore , these events do contribute to the total bulge event rate and thus to the optical depth",
    ". however , the contribution is not large enough to explain an important fraction of the gap between the optical depth estimates based on cg stars and the dia results , implying that exploring other possible reasons that can explain the gap is needed .",
    "prompted by the gap between the microlensing optical depth estimates based on cg stars and the dia result , we investigated the previously unconsidered effect of unresolved binary companions to source stars on the determination of the optical depth toward the galactic bulge field . by carrying out simulations based on the assumption that companions follow the same lf of primary stars , we assessed the contribution of the companion - associated events to the total optical depth would be @xmath60 for current lensing surveys and can reach up to @xmath2 for future surveys monitoring fainter stars . we , therefore , conclude that events associated with companion stars comprises a non - negligible fraction of the total events , but their contribution to the optical depth is not large enough to explain the systematic difference between the optical depth estimates based on the two different methods .",
