    "we have checked it by an explicit calculation of the coefficients @xmath47 up to @xmath165 and found that the two methods give identical results ( [ f - results ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we extended the calculation via the painlev v equation up to @xmath166 : this allowed us to calculate the first 15 coeffiencts @xmath47 and verify the expansion ( [ gfh-1])([gfh-2 ] ) up to @xmath144 .",
    "the main result of this work is the conjecture of the `` periodic form '' of the asymptotic expansion ( [ gfh-1])([gfh-2 ] ) for the wiener  hopf determinant ( [ chi - def1 ] ) .",
    "this expansion is based on the proven form ( [ expansion - general ] ) , together with the `` periodicity conjecture '' ( [ periodicity - conjecture ] ) .",
    "the latter can be verified to any order in @xmath10 by an explicit calculation .",
    "our methods only allow to establish the asymptotic expansion away from the fisher  hartwig switching points @xmath50 . however , we believe that it also holds there [ this is supported by the numerical calculation of ref .   in the lattice case ] , which would result in a uniform [ with respect to @xmath167 estimate : @xmath168 + o ( e^{-2\\i \\kappa\\ , x } x^{-n_0})\\ , , \\label{gfh - uniform}\\ ] ] where @xmath169 @xmath170 denotes the integer part , and we assume @xmath171 .    in the context of the generalized fisher  hartwig conjecture",
    ", our expansion ( [ gfh-1 ] ) , ( [ gfh-2 ] ) may be viewed as a detailed description of the switching between fisher  hartwig branches as a function of the parameter @xmath17 . in physical terms , this switching between asymptotic branches is a particular example of a more general notion of `` counting phase transition '' introduced for full - counting - statistics problems in ref .  .",
    "a practical application of our result is a convenient method of computing cumulants of the number of fermions @xmath15 on a line segment of length @xmath16 in the free - fermion problem described in section  [ sec : formulation ] . while those cumulants may , in principle , be computed using the wick theorem ( see , e.g. , ref .  )",
    ", the complexity of such calculations grows rapidly with the order of the cumulant and with the degree of the @xmath172 correction .",
    "remarkably , the same cumulants may be obtained by the straightforward taylor expansion of our series ( [ gfh-1 ] ) , ( [ gfh-2 ] ) at @xmath173 .",
