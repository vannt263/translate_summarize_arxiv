    "the standard approach to modeling a large on - line social network is to treat it as a single graph with an enormous number of nodes and a sparse pattern of connections .",
    "increasingly , however , many of the key problems encountered in managing an on - line social network involve working with large collections of small , dense graphs contained within the network .",
    "on facebook , for example , the set of people belonging to a group or attending an event determines such a graph , and considering the set of all groups or all events leads to a very large number of such graphs . on any social network , the network neighborhood of each individual  consisting of his or her friends and the links among them  is also generally a small dense graph with a rich structure , on a few hundred nodes or fewer @xcite .",
    "if we consider the neighborhood of each user as defining a distinct graph , we again obtain an enormous collection of graphs .",
    "indeed , this view of a large underlying social network in terms of its overlapping node neighborhoods suggests a potentially valuable perspective on the analysis of the network : rather than thinking of facebook , for example , as a single billion - node network , with a global structure that quickly becomes incomprehensible , we argue that it can be useful to think of it as the superposition of a billion small dense graphs  the network neighborhoods , one centered at each user , and each accessible to a closer and more tractable investigation .    nor",
    "is this view limited to a site such as facebook ; one can find collections of small dense graphs in the interactions within a set of discussion forums @xcite , within a set of collaborative on - line projects @xcite , and in a range of other settings .",
    "our focus in the present work is on a fundamental global question about these types of graph collections : given a large set of small dense graphs , can we study this set by defining a meaningful ` coordinate system ' on it , so that the graphs it contains can be represented and understood within a common space ?",
    "with such a coordinate system providing a general - purpose framework for analysis , additional questions become possible . for example , when considering collections of a billion or more social graphs , it may seem as though almost any graph is possible ; is that the case , or are there underlying properties guiding the observed structures ? and how do these properties relate to more fundamental combinatorial constraints deriving from the extremal limits that govern all graphs ? as a further example , we can ask how different graph collections compare to one another ; do network neighborhoods differ in some systematic way , for instance , from social graphs induced by other contexts , such as the graphs implicit in social groups , organized events , or other arrangements ?    [ [ the - present - work ] ] * the present work * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this paper we develop and analyze such a representation , drawing on the theory of _",
    "graph homomorphisms_. roughly speaking , the coordinate system we examine begins by describing a graph by the frequencies with which all possible small subgraphs occur within it .",
    "more precisely , we choose a small number @xmath0 ( e.g. @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) ; then , for each graph @xmath3 in a collection , we create a vector with a coordinate for each distinct @xmath0-node subgraph @xmath4 , specifying the fraction of @xmath0-tuples of nodes in @xmath3 that induce a copy of @xmath4 ( in other words , the frequency of @xmath4 as an induced subgraph of @xmath3 ) . for @xmath5 , this description corresponds to what is sometimes referred to as the _ triad census _ @xcite .",
    "the literature on _ frequent subgraph mining _",
    "@xcite , and _ motif counting _",
    "@xcite is also is closely related , but focuses on connected subgraphs .",
    "with each graph in the collection mapped to such a vector , we can ask how the full collection of graphs fills out this space of subgraph frequencies .",
    "this turns out to be a subtle issue , because the arrangement of the graphs in this space is governed by two distinct sets of effects : extremal combinatorial constraints showing that certain combinations of subgraph frequencies are genuinely impossible ; and empirical properties , which reveal that the bulk of the graphs tend to lie close to a simple one - dimensional curve through the space .",
    "we formulate results on both these types of properties , in the former case building on an expanding body of combinatorial theory @xcite for bounding the frequencies at which different types of subgraphs can occur in a larger ambient graph .",
    "the fact that the space of subgraph frequencies is constrained in these multiple ways also allows us to concretely address the following type of question : when we see that human social networks do not exhibit a certain type of structure , is that because such a structure is mathematically impossible , or simply because human beings do not create it when they form social connections ?",
    "in other words , what is a property of graphs and what is a property of people ?",
    "although this question is implicit in many studies of social networks , it is hard to separate the two effects without a formal framework such as we have here .",
    "indeed , our framework offers a direct contribution to one of the most well - known observations about social graphs : the tendency of social relationships to close triangles , and the relative infrequency of what is sometimes called the ` forbidden triad ' : three people with two social relationships between them , but one absent relationship @xcite .",
    "there are many sociological theories for why one would expect this subgraph to be underrepresented in empirical social networks @xcite .",
    "our framework shows that the frequency of this ` forbidden triad ' has a non - trivial upper bound in not just social graphs , but in all graphs . harnessing our framework",
    "more generally , we are in fact able to show that _ any _ @xmath0 node subgraph that is not a complete or empty subgraph has a frequency that is bounded away from one .",
    "thus , there is an extent to which almost all subgraphs are mathematically ` forbidden ' from occurring beyond a certain frequency .",
    "we aim to separate these mathematical limits of graphs from the complementary empirical properties of real social graphs .",
    "the fact that real graph collections have a roughly one - dimensional structure in our coordinate system leads directly to our first main question : is it possible to succinctly characterize the underlying backbone for this one - dimensional structure , and can we use such a characterization to usefully describe graphs within our coordinate system in terms of their deviation from this backbone ?    the subgraph frequencies of the standard erds - rnyi random graph @xcite @xmath6 produce a one - dimensional curve ( parametrized by @xmath7 ) that weakly approximates the layout of the real graphs in the space , but the curve arising from this random graph model systematically deviates from the real graphs in that the random graph contains fewer triangles and more triangle - free subgraphs .",
    "this observation is consistent with the sociological principle of _ triadic closure _  that triangles tend to form in social networks . as a means of closing",
    "this deviation from @xmath6 , we develop a tractable stochastic model of graph generation with a single additional parameter , determining the relative rates of arbitrary edge formation and triangle - closing edge formation .",
    "the model exhibits rich behaviors , and for appropriately chosen settings of its single parameter , it produce remarkably close agreement with the subgraph frequencies observed in real data for the suite of all possible 3-node and 4-node subgraphs .",
    "finally , we use this representation to study how different collections of graphs may differ from one another .",
    "this arises as a question of basic interest in the analysis of large social media platforms , where users continuously manage multiple audiences @xcite  ranging from their set of friends , to the members of a groups they ve joined , to the attendees of events and beyond .",
    "do these audiences differ from each other at a structural level , and if so what are the distinguishing characteristics ? using facebook data , we identify structural differences between the graphs induced on network neighborhoods , groups , and events .",
    "the underlying basis for these differences suggests corresponding distinctions in each user s reaction to these different audiences with whom they interact .",
    "throughout our presentation , we analyze several collections of graphs collected from facebook s social network .",
    "the collections we study are all induced graphs from the facebook friendship graph , which records friendship connections as undirected edges between users , and thus all our induced graphs are also undirected .",
    "the framework we characterize in this work would naturally extend to provide insights about directed graphs , an extension we do not discuss .",
    "we do not include edges formed by facebook ` subscriptions ' in our study , nor do we include facebook ` pages ' or connections from users to such pages .",
    "all facebook social graph data was analyzed in an anonymous , aggregated form .",
    "for this work , we extracted three different collections of graphs , around which we organize our discussion :    * * neighborhoods * : graphs induced by the friends of a single facebook user _ ego _ and the friendship connections among these individuals ( excluding the ego ) . *",
    "* groups * : graphs induced by the members of a ` facebook group ' , a facebook feature for organizing focused conversations between a small or moderate - sized set of users . * * events * : graphs induced by the confirmed attendees of ` facebook events ' , a facebook feature for coordinating invitations to calendar events .",
    "users can response ` yes ' , ` no ' , and ` maybe ' to such invitations , and we consider only users who respond ` yes ' .",
    "the neighborhood and groups collections were assembled in october 2012 based on monthly active user egos and current groups , while the events data was collected from all events during 2010 and 2011 . for event graphs , only friendship edges formed prior to the date of the event were used .",
    "subgraph frequencies for four - node subgraphs were computed by sampling 11,000 induced subgraphs uniformly with replacement , providing sufficiently precise frequencies without enumeration .",
    "the graph collections were targeted at a variety of different graph sizes , as will be discussed in the text .",
    "in this section , we study the space of subgraph frequencies that form the basis of our coordinate system , and the one - dimensional concentration of empirical graphs within this coordinate system .",
    "we derive a model capable of accurately identifying the backbone of this empirical concentration using only the basic principle of _ triadic closure _ , showing how the subgraph frequencies of empirical social graphs are seemingly restricted to the vicinity of a simple one - dimensional structure .",
    "formally , the subgraph frequency of a @xmath0-node graph @xmath8 in an @xmath9-node graph @xmath3 ( where @xmath10 ) is the probability that a random @xmath0-node subset of @xmath3 induces a copy of @xmath8 .",
    "it is clear that for any integer @xmath0 , the subgraph frequencies of all the @xmath0-node graphs sum to one , constraining the vector of frequencies to an appropriately dimensioned simplex . in the case of @xmath5 ,",
    "this vector is simply the relative frequency of induced three - node subgraphs restricted to the 4-simplex ; there are just four such subgraphs , with zero , one , two , and three edges respectively .",
    "when considering the frequency of larger subgraphs , the dimension of the simplex grows very quickly , and already for @xmath11 , the space of four - node subgraph frequencies lives in an 11-simplex .

    "the three collections discussed in section [ sec : data ] , totaling 51,000 graphs at each size .",
    "because these frequency vectors are constrained to the 4-simplex , their distribution can be visualized in @xmath12 with three of the frequencies as axes .",
    "notice that these graph collections , induced from disparate contexts , all occupy a sharply concentrated subregion of the unit simplex .",
    "the points in the space have been represented simply as an unordered scatterplot , and two striking phenomena already stand out : first , the particular concentrated structure within the simplex that the points follow ; and second , the fact that we can already discern a non - uniform distribution of the three contexts ( neighborhoods , groups and events ) within the space  that is , the different contexts can already be seen to have different structural loci .",
    "notice also that as the sizes of the graphs increases  from 50 to 100 to 200  the distribution appears to sharpen around the one - dimensional backbone .",
    "the vast number of graphs that we are able to consider by studying facebook data is here illuminating a structure that is simply not discernible in previous examinations of subgraph frequencies @xcite , since no analysis has previously considered a collection near this scale .",
    "the imagery of figure [ f:3d ] directly motivates our work , by visually framing the essence of our investigation : what facets of this curious structure derive from our graphs being social graphs , and what facets are simply universal properties of all graphs ?",
    "we will find , in particular , that parts of the space of subgraph frequencies are in fact inaccessible to graphs for purely combinatorial reasons  it is mathematically impossible for one of the points in the scatterplot to occupy these parts of the space .",
    "but there are other parts of the space that are mathematically possible ; it is simply that no real social graphs appear to be located within them .",
    "intuitively , then , we are looking at a population density within an ambient space ( the facebook graphs within the space of subgraph frequencies ) , and we would like to understand both the geography of the inhabited terrain ( what are the properties of the areas where the population has in fact settled ? ) and also the properties of the boundaries of the space as a whole ( where , in principle , would it be possible for the population to settle ? ) .",
    "also in figure [ f:3d ] , we plot the curve for the frequencies for 3 node subgraphs in @xmath13 as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "the curves are given simply by the probability of obtaining the desired number of edges in a three node graph , @xmath14 .",
    "this curve closely tracks the empirical density through the space , with a single notable discrepancy : the real world graphs systemically contain more triangles when compared to @xmath13 at the same edge density .",
    "we emphasize that it is not a priori clear why @xmath13 would at all be a good model of subgraph frequencies in modestly - sized dense social graphs such as the neighborhoods , groups , and events that we have here ; we believe the fact that it tracks the data with any fidelity at all is an interesting issue for future work . beyond @xmath13 , in the following subsection",
    ", we present a stochastic model of edge formation and deletion on graphs specifically designed to close the remaining discrepancy . as such",

    "we first describe this basic version of the model ; we then add a component to the model that captures a triadic closure process , which produces a close fit to the properties we observe in real graphs .",

    "thus the single parameter @xmath19 , the effective formation rate of edges , completely characterizes the process .",
    "notice that this process is clearly irreducible , since it is possible to transition between any two graphs via edge additions and deletions .",
    "since @xmath16 is irreducible , it possesses a unique stationary distribution .",
    "the stationary distribution of an irreducible continuous time markov chain can be found as the unique stable fixed point of the linear dynamical system @xmath20 that describes the diffusion of probability mass during a random walk on @xmath9-node graphs , where @xmath21 is the generator matrix with transition rates @xmath22 and @xmath23 , all depending only on @xmath24 .",
    "the stationary distribution @xmath25 then satisfies @xmath26 .",

    "all other transition rates are zero .",
    "we call this new chain the _ labeled chain _ , and",
    "the original chain the _ unlabeled chain . _    now , suppose there is a transition from unlabeled graph @xmath32 to unlabeled graph @xmath33 in the unlabeled chain , with transition probability @xmath34 .",
    "this means that there are @xmath0 ways to add an edge to a labeled copy of @xmath32 to produce a graph isomorphic to @xmath33 .",
    "now , let @xmath28 be any graph in the labeled chain that is isomorphic to @xmath32 . in the labeled chain , there are @xmath0 transitions out of @xmath28 leading to a graph isomorphic to @xmath33 , and each of these has probability @xmath35 . thus , with probability @xmath34",
    ", a transition out of @xmath28 leads to a graph isomorphic to @xmath33 .",
    "a strictly analogous argument can be made for edge deletions , rather than edge additions .",
    "this argument shows that the following describes a markov chain equivalent to the original unlabeled chain : we draw a sequence of labeled graphs from the labeled chain , and we output the isomorphism classes of these labeled graphs .",
    "hence , to compute the stationary distribution of the original unlabeled chain , which is what we seek , we can compute the stationary distribution of the labeled chain and then sum stationary probabilities in the labeled chain over the isomorphism classes of labeled graphs .",
    "it thus suffices to verify the detailed balance condition for the distribution on the labeled chain that assigns probability @xmath36 to each labeled graph @xmath28 .",
    "since every transition of the labeled walk occurs between two labeled graphs @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with @xmath37 , the only non - trivial detailed balance equations are of the form : @xmath38 & = & q_{ji } { { \\text{pr}}}[x(t ) = g_j]\\\\   { { \\text{pr}}}[x(t ) = g_i ] & = & \\nu { { \\text{pr}}}[x(t ) = g_j ] \\\\ { { \\text{pr}}}[x(t ) = g_i ] & = & \\frac{p}{1-p } { { \\text{pr}}}[x(t ) = g_j].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the probability assigned to the labeled graph @xmath28 by @xmath13 is simply @xmath36 , detailed balance is clearly satisfied .

    "this framework makes it possible to model random graphs where certain types of edge formations or deletions have irregular probabilities of occurring , simply via small perturbations away from the classic @xmath13 model . using this principle",
    ", we now characterize a random graph model that differs from @xmath13 by a single parameter , @xmath39 , the rate at which 3-node paths in the graph tend to form triangles .",
