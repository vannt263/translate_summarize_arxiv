    "natural systems store , retrieve , transmit , and exchange information by means of a wide variety of mechanisms .",
    "this diversity is apparent if we compare , for instance , the genetic code , a bird song , and a written text .",
    "genetic information , which contains the instructions to build up proteins out of the chemical substrate inside living cells , is processed at the level of dna molecules , involving chemical reactions and elementary quantum - mechanical interactions . at a much more macroscopic level",
    ", the elaboration , emission , and reception of a bird song a courtship call , for instance activates a series of intermingled processes which involve at least several regions of the brain , the vocal tract , and the ear . a written text , characteristic of some human languages , presupposes a conventional agreement for the symbolic representation of meaningful phoneme sets the words . information processing through written language always requires , to some extent , resorting to artificial human - made tools , from pen and paper to computers .",
    "it is remarkable that , in spite of the essential differences in nature between the basic phenomena which sustain information processing in its various forms , some universal features can still be found to underlie the way in which information is organized in different systems .",
    "one of these features , directly related to the sequential character of information processing , is associated with the possibility of translating pieces of information into ordered series of symbols . identifying the proper information units to be translated into individual symbols may be easier although rarely trivial in some systems such as dna molecules or human languages , and more complicated in others , such as animal calls .",
    "a complex message conveying information simultaneously at many sensorial layers , such as a musical piece , may even admit several very different symbolic codings , emphasizing different informational aspects of the same message .",
    "however , once a translation code has been agreed upon , symbol streams can be generated and analyzed as a consistent representation of the information contents of the system under study .",
    "due to the very essence of information , a symbolic sequence representing a message is expected to possess nontrivial structural properties at many length scales . over short ranges ,",
    "such properties are governed by a set of rules which govern the combination of adjacent symbols or , in other words , by grammar . at this level ,",
    "the structure of many human languages is reasonably well understood , which has also led to the development of an abstract mathematical theory of ( natural and artificial ) languages . in the case of dna molecules ,",
    "localized patterns are directly related to the coding of individual proteins , which control in turn specific phenotypic traits in the organism . for other informational systems , on the other hand , even short - range structures have unidentified functional roles . over larger scales , long streams of human language",
    "should reveal patterns associated with meaning , context , and style @xcite .",
    "these global properties are also expected to appear in long musical compositions @xcite .",
    "long - range structures in dna , extending over several thousand nucleotides , are by far less understood and their interpretation is controversial @xcite .",
    "while extracting grammar rules from the symbolic sequences of any kind of language requires a detailed inspection of the local configuration of symbols , regularities at larger scales are better detected by statistical means .",
    "dna @xcite and language sequences @xcite have already been analyzed in this way , revealing long - range correlations which , due to their power - law dependence on length , seem to point out the presence of some kind of overall fractal structure . in the case of dna ,",
    "such correlations have been ascribed to the presence and organization of `` patches '' with different nucleotide composition @xcite . to disclose and characterize this patchiness ,",
    "a segmentation algorithm for dna sequences has been proposed on the basis of maximizing the compositional difference between the resulting segments @xcite , as measured by the jensen - shannon divergence @xcite .",
    "the method is aimed at detecting domains within which the relative frequencies of the four nucleotides may sensibly differ from other portions of the sequence .",
    "besides giving an acceptable definition of `` patch '' , by its identification with a segment , the recursive application of the segmentation algorithm has made it possible to reveal power - law distributions for the segment length @xcite .",
    "this broad distribution of patch sizes has recently been proposed as a fingerprint of complexity in the analyzed symbolic sequence @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to illustrate the result of applying the segmentation algorithm to other classes of symbolic sequences , specifically , to sequences of linguistic or musical origin .",
    "the possibility of detecting segments with different composition in this class of sequences is particularly appealing , since such segments may be identified with contextual domains .",
    "understanding context as the emergent property of a message which sustains its intelligibility in the long run @xcite , those domains would correspond to portions where the distinct internal distribution of perceptual elements determines specific contextual features .",
    "which of these features are detected by segmentation depends , as shown below , on the choice of the collection of symbols out of which the sequence under study is built up . in the examples presented here , we focus on the variation in the distribution of characters along a theatrical play , and in the domains of tonal context in a musical composition . in the next section , the segmentation algorithm is introduced .",
    "sections [ lit ] and [ mus ] are respectively devoted to the segmentation analysis of sequences of literary and musical origin .",
    "results , as well as limitations and perspectives of the method , are discussed in the last section .",
    "as advanced in the introduction , the segmentation algorithm used below is based on the calculation of the jensen - shannon ( js ) divergence @xcite . given two probability distributions @xmath0 and @xmath1 over @xmath2 discrete states",
    ", @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the js divergence defines a distance between the two distributions , as @xmath5 = h[w_p { \\bf p}+w_q { \\bf q}]-w_p h[{\\bf p } ] -w_q h[{\\bf q}],\\ ] ] where @xmath6= -\\sum_{i=1}^k p_i \\log_2 p_i\\ ] ] is shannon s entropy for the distribution @xmath7 .",
    "the positive weights @xmath8 and @xmath9 satisfy @xmath10 , and the linear combination @xmath11 is a probability distribution with components @xmath12 . it is assumed that the distributions @xmath7 and @xmath13 are normalized to unity , so that @xmath14 .",
    "this implies that @xmath11 is also normalized .    as a distance between two distributions ,",
    "the js divergence verifies some desirable properties .",
    "in particular , it is symmetric : @xmath15 = d[{\\bf q},{\\bf p}]$ ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath16 > 0 $ ] for all @xmath17 , and @xmath16 = 0 $ ] if and only if @xmath18 .",
    "suppose now to have a sequence of length @xmath19 , whose elements are taken from an `` alphabet '' of @xmath2 different symbols @xmath20 .",
    "consider the two subsequences given by the first @xmath21 elements of the sequence and the remaining @xmath22 elements .",
    "in the first subsequence , of length @xmath21 , the frequency of the symbol @xmath23 is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of occurrences of @xmath23 in that subsequence .",
    "note that , since @xmath26 , the distribution @xmath27 is normalized to unity .",
    "proceeding in the same way for the second subsequence , the frequency of symbol @xmath23 is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the total number of occurrences of @xmath23 in the whole sequence .",
    "again , the distribution @xmath30 is normalized to unity .",
    "the distributions @xmath31 and @xmath32 characterize the frequencies of symbols in each subsequence , and their js divergence gives a measure of how different they are .",
    "in other words , @xmath33 $ ] quantifies the compositional difference between the two subsequences . the weight of each distribution in the js divergence is usually taken to be proportional to the length of the corresponding subsequence @xcite , i.e. @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we thus calculate @xmath36 = h\\left [ \\frac{n}{n } { \\bf f}+ \\left ( 1-\\frac{n}{n } \\right){\\bf g}\\right]-\\frac{n}{n } h[{\\bf f } ] - \\left ( 1-\\frac{n}{n } \\right ) h[{\\bf g}].\\ ] ] the subindex @xmath21 emphasizes the fact that , generally , the value of the js divergence depends on where the whole sequence is divided into the two subsequences . note that , in the trivial limits @xmath37 and @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 . varying @xmath21 from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , the point @xmath42 where @xmath43 reaches a maximum can be readily detected . at that point ,",
    "the compositional divergence of the two subsequences is largest : @xmath44 for all @xmath21 .",
    "the first segmentation is therefore performed at @xmath42 , and two segments with maximal compositional divergence result .",
    "once the first segmentation step has been achieved , the algorithm can be applied to the resulting segments .",
    "further iteration the process will produce , at successive segmentation levels , four , eight , sixteen , @xmath45 segments of decreasing length . at any level , each pair of contiguous segments will represent the optimal division of one the segments of the previous level with respect to their compositional divergence .",
    "therefore , the segmentation obtained at each level contains increasingly detailed information about variations in the frequency of different symbols along the original sequence .    in principle , since @xmath43 will always reach a maximum within any segment of length larger than or equal to @xmath46 , the segmentation process can be iterated until segments are reduced to a minimal length of @xmath47 .",
    "it is obvious , however , that well before the original sequence becomes atomized into such minimal segments , the resulting segmentation will cease to bear any information related to long - range compositional variations .",
    "when segments are short enough , the algorithm will be rather detecting the effect of random - like local fluctuations in the distribution of symbols , with no significant connection with long - range structures .",
    "a criterion for halting the iteration of the segmentation algorithm can be established by comparing the maximal value of the js divergence along the ( sub)sequence being processed with the typical value expected for @xmath43 in a random sequence of identical length and the same symbol frequencies @xcite .",
    "for instance , we can assume that the maximum in the js divergence is significant if it is larger than the sum of the average value of @xmath43 plus its mean dispersion in the random sequence .",
    "unfortunately , evaluating statistical properties of the js divergence , such as its mean value and dispersion , is not an easy task even for a random uncorrelated sequence although approximations have been provided @xcite . in our analysis of linguistic and musical sequences , on the other hand ,",
    "we have adopted a heuristic approach which , operationally , turns out to be quite convenient . after calculating the js divergence along the ( sub)sequence to be segmented and detecting its maximum @xmath48 ,",
    "we randomly shuffle the ( sub)sequence and calculate @xmath43 again .",
    "the typical result , as a function of @xmath21 , is a kind of noisy signal whose average value and mean dispersion can be calculated in the standard way : @xmath49 here , @xmath50 is the length of the ( sub)sequence .",
    "the above - stated criterion would imply that the segmentation is significant if @xmath51 .    in the following sections",
    ", we illustrate the application of these methods to two sequences , respectively , of literary and musical origin .",
    "of course , a preliminary , not necessarily trivial task is to decide how to extract a symbolic sequence out of a written text or a musical composition .",
    "once this point is defined , however , the above algorithm can be straightforwardly applied to segment the sequence , the significance of segmentation can be evaluated , and results can be discussed in the perspective of the contents of the literary and musical works under consideration .",
    "a written text can naturally be thought of as a sequence of symbols . at the level of the semantic contents of the message , i.e. of its meaning ,",
    "individual symbols can be identified with single words .",
    "this choice immediately posses the problem that , in any text of substantial length , the number of different symbols is enormous .",
    "for instance , a literary work of the size of dickens s david copperfield or of cervantes s don quijote , whose length spans a few hundred thousands words , uses some 20,000 to 30,000 different words . on the average , thus , each word appears some ten times all over the work .",
    "the evaluation of probabilities from such small frequencies would hardly be statistically significant .",
    "there is moreover the problem that those words whose frequency is high enough as to allow for a satisfactory determination of a probability distribution , are usually irrelevant in defining the text s semantic contents .",
    "the most frequent words in any human language in english , for instance , the words _ the _ , _ and _ , _ a _ , _ of _ , etc. convey no specific information on the contextual domain .",
    "we conclude that a sequence of symbols derived from a written text must be built up in a different manner .    in a previous work @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that , over a large literary corpus , different words are distributed more or less homogeneously depending on their grammatical function .",
    "nouns and , most particularly , proper nouns are much more specific to localized domains of the corpus than , for instance , verbs or adverbs . in other words , the former are distributed less homogeneously that the latter , thus conveying more information about the local context . in the frame of the present study",
    ", this property can be exploited by choosing as a set of symbols a selection of those words with larger specificity , and building up a sequence with just such symbols . in the following , we apply these ideas to extract a sequence of symbols from shakespeare s play othello @xcite .    from the viewpoint of the text structure ,",
    "a play is a succession of ( usually not very long ) speeches , alternatively uttered by the various characters .",
    "let us call each one of these successive speeches a _",
    "line_. let us moreover associate a symbol to each character .",
    "if each line is now assigned the symbol of the character who utters it , the succession of lines along the play defines a sequence of symbols which represents the progressive participation of the different characters .",
    "for instance , othello s first act , which opens with a dialog between roderigo ( r ) and iago ( i ) , with the later entrance of brabantio ( b ) , is represented by the sequence ririririririribribi ... the choice of a sequence built up by these symbols would lead the segmentation process to reveal the presence of domains with relatively different relevance of the various characters .",
    "it thus focuses on the specific component of context determined by character presences and absences as the action proceeds .",
    "shakespeare s othello has @xmath52 `` actors '' ( characters ) @xcite , and spans @xmath53 lines .",
    "therefore , each symbol in the sequence appears an average of some @xmath54 times .",
    "however , the five most important characters utter a total of more than @xmath55 lines .",
    "these are othello ( @xmath56 lines ) , iago ( @xmath57 lines ) , desdemona ( @xmath58 lines ) , cassio ( @xmath59 lines ) , and emilia ( @xmath60 lines ) ; the next most important character reaches less than @xmath61 lines . along the play ,",
    "frequency changes in the appearance of the five main characters on scene dominate the compositional variation between different parts of the sequence and , thus , have an essential role in determining the result of segmentation .",
    "the role of other characters is secondary though , as we show below , they have an effect at certain segmentation levels .",
    "the play is divided into five acts .",
    "the first act takes place in venice , while the remaining of the action is in cyprus .",
    "since not all the characters migrate from venice to cyprus , we expect that the change of geographical environment be associated with a variation in the relative distribution of characters , which may be detected by segmentation .",
    "more subtle location transitions such as , for instance , between different places in venice during the first act may also induce compositional variations in the sequence .",
    "each act is divided into two to four scenes of rather disparate lengths . unlike the classical convention which prescribes a change of scene each time a character enters or exits , shakespeare s division of acts into scenes is freer .",
    "still , scene beginnings and ends are usually associated with major changes in the action and its agents .",
    "segmentation could therefore be also related to the division in scenes .",
    "figure [ oth1 ] shows the js divergence for the whole sequence of @xmath53 lines .",
    "vertical full and dashed lines indicate the division into acts and scenes , respectively .",
    "rather unexpectedly , the maximum in the js divergence , at line @xmath62 , does not coincide with any of those divisions .",
    "it is therefore not revealing a mere localized exchange of characters or an episodic turning point in the action , but rather a more global and perhaps more subtle change in the characters relevance on stage .",
    "in fact , an analysis of the progressive appearances of individual characters shows that , in the first third of the play , the protagonists othello and desdemona utter only one sixth of their total number of lines . during this",
    "first third , both of them appear episodically in most occasions , usually in the company of several other characters , and do not participate of long dialogues . in the remaining two thirds of the play , on the other hand , othello and desdemona",
    "are practically omnipresent either together or not and , except for some short scenes , clearly dominate the action progression .",
    "the maximum in the js divergence corresponds to this major , but not necessarily obvious , change in the participation of the protagonist couple .",
    "the js divergence after the first segmentation step is shown in figure [ oth2 ] . in the first part",
    ", it shows a sharp peak at line @xmath63 , at the precise end of act i. as mentioned above , in the transition form the first to the second act the action is transferred from venice to cyprus .",
    "correspondingly , several relatively dominant characters of act i such as brabantio , the duke and the senators definitively disappear from the stage .",
    "thus , through this sudden change in the appearance frequency of otherwise minor characters , the js divergence detects the shift in the geographical setting . in the second segment",
    ", the js divergence reaches its maximum at line @xmath64 .",
    "this line does not coincide with a scene transition , but lies in a zone of considerable frequency changes in two characters , cassio and desdemona .",
    "after an appearance at the beginning of act iv , cassio is absent for the rest of the act .",
    "desdemona , on the other hand , dominates vast sections from its second scene .",
    "the next segmentation level is depicted in figure [ oth3 ] . in the fist segment ,",
    "the maximum occurs at line @xmath65 , just at the end of the second scene of act i. again , this maximum is detecting a setting transition .",
    "while the two first scenes take place in a venetian street , the third scene unfolds in a `` council chamber '' presumably , in the ducal palace with the ensuing change in the dominant characters .",
    "the duke and the senators are specific to this scene , and pervade the dialogue up to its end . in the second segment , the js divergence is maximal at line @xmath66 , in the middle of the first scene of act ii .",
    "this maximum can be ascribed to a rather abrupt growth in the appearance frequency of cassio . during act",
    "i and the first part of act ii , he plays an essentially marginal role , with some @xmath67 lines . by the end of act ii , however , he has had more than @xmath68 lines . in the third segment ,",
    "the js divergency attains a sharp maximum at line @xmath69 .",
    "this is again due to cassio , who has remained silent for most of act iii , but reappears with many lines by the end of that act and the beginning of the following .",
    "at the same time , desdemona and emilia , who had been on stage during large sections of act iii , become considerably less frequent until their reappearance by the middle of the act iv .",
    "finally , the maximum at the fourth segment , line @xmath70 , coincides exactly with the last utterance by desdemona , at the fatal moment where she dies by his jealous husband s hand .",
    "figures [ oth1 ] to [ oth3 ] show , as horizontal lines , the average values and dispersions of the js divergence for random sequences with the same lengths and symbol frequencies as the corresponding segments , calculated as explained in section [ anal ] .",
    "all the maxima in the js divergence are well above the intervals @xmath71 , indicating that at the analyzed levels the segmentation is detecting highly significant non - random compositional differences .",
    "let us point out a few relevant facts .",
    "note first that cassio and desdemona are involved in the determination of many segmentation points at least , up to the segmentation level considered here .",
    "this is due to the fact that , among the main characters , their appearance frequencies varies most irregularly .",
    "both are absent during rather long sections , but participate actively when they are on scene . on the other hand , the ubiquitous , evil - doer iago the second most frequent protagonist is evenly present over the whole play .",
    "his role in defining contextual segments is therefore not important at the considered levels .",
    "secondly , note that , at the last segmentation level ( figure [ oth3 ] ) , most transitions between contiguous scenes and acts correspond either to a segmentation point or to a local maximum in the js divergence .",
    "although local maxima are not involved in the segmentation process , they also reveal points with high compositional differences at both sides . at this level , thus , the js divergence is detecting the domains chosen by shakespeare to divide his play .",
    "finally , also in figure [ oth3 ] , note the occurrence of many u - shaped structures , some of them indicated by arrows .",
    "they correspond to dialogues between two characters , whose alternate utterances give rise to this characteristic profile .",
    "the insert in the figure is a close - up of the main plot in one of these regions , showing the correspondingly alternating values of the js divergence .",
    "such small - scale structures are already clearly discerned at this segmentation level .",
    "the relative frequency in the use of the different tones of the twelve - tone musical scale is the primordial element determining what in modern ( post - renaissance ) western music is called the tonality of a composition , or of one of its parts .",
    "conditions of consonance and dissonance of simultaneously sounding tones , as well as the aesthetic viability of certain tone sequences , determine how often they occur with respect to each other . in the tonality of c major , for instance , the tone g ( the so - called dominant of c ) is expected to occur much more frequently than g sharp ( g # ) , while the opposite is true in e major ( where g # is part of the fundamental chord , e@xmath72g#@xmath72b ) @xcite . in connection with the present discussion , tonality defines a contextual frame associated with the more or less frequent occurrence of different tones .",
    "tones are the perceptual elements which define the tonal context @xcite .    since the early baroque period",
    ", a systematic way for adding interest to a musical composition has been to modify the tonality as the composition progresses a procedure called modulation . as a result of modulation",
    ", successive parts of the composition correspond to different tonal contexts .",
    "this procedure proved to be so aesthetically convincing that certain musical forms ( such as the sonata ; see below ) developed standardized modulation motifs .",
    "the segmentation of a symbolic sequence representing the succession of tones in a musical composition should disclose the structure associated with the transitions between tonal contexts . to show this , we first identify each of the twelve tones as a different symbol .",
    "second , we must overcome the drawback that a composition is not just a sequence of tones since , at a given time , many of them may sound simultaneously .",
    "this can be solved by exploiting the discreteness of time patterns in most musical styles , defined by rhythm , to introduce a kind of coarse - grained discretization of the succession of tones .",
    "rhythm beats are grouped into bars ( also called measures ) , all of them usually containing the same number of beats .",
    "bars are the basic units underlying the rhythmic pattern .",
    "every tone can be unambiguously assigned to the bar where it begins . in this way , it is possible to build a sequence with the number of occurrences of each symbol in each bar in the succession .",
    "when calculating the js divergence , the relative frequencies of symbols are obtained as the normalized sum of those numbers to the right and to the left of the segmentation point .",
    "we apply the segmentation algorithm to a sequence obtained from the first movement of the keyboard sonata in c major k.  545 by mozart , which spans @xmath73 bars .",
    "the sequence is built automatically from a digital version of the composition in midi format @xcite .",
    "the result of the three first segmentation steps is shown in figure [ k545 ] .",
    "as explained in the following , the analysis of the musical score reveals that _ all _ the segments detected by the algorithm can be identified with well - defined domains of tonal context in the composition .",
    "the first movement of the sonata k.  545 has a standard ternary structure which , rather confusingly , is called sonata form usually denoted as @xmath74 .",
    "section @xmath75 corresponds to the exposition , where the main musical material of the composition is introduced ; @xmath76 is the development section , where the material is elaborated in various forms ; finally , in the recapitulation @xmath77 the material is again presented in its original form , usually with some variations , leading to the conclusion . as shown in the upper panel of figure [ k545 ] , the js divergence calculated over the whole sequence of @xmath73 bars has a well - defined maximum at bar @xmath78 , which exactly coincides with the end of section @xmath75 . in this composition , a sudden tonality change , from g major to g minor , occurs at the transition from section @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "this is detected by the js divergence as the most important boundary of frequency difference in the use of tones .    within the exposition section @xmath75",
    ", the standard sonata form prescribes the presentation of two different melodic themes , in two different tonalities : the main tonality of the composition ( in our case , c major ) and , typically , its dominant ( g major ) .",
    "the remaining of the composition , sections @xmath76 and @xmath77 , can have a freer form .",
    "in the first movement of k.  545 , section @xmath76 is an elaboration of part of the second theme presented in @xmath75 combined with new melodic material , and progresses from the tonalities of g minor to d minor .",
    "the recapitulation @xmath77 re - introduces the first and the second theme of section @xmath75 but now in f major and c major , respectively before proceeding to the coda and ending the movement .    in the middle panel of figure [ k545 ]",
    ", we see that the maximum of the js divergence in the first segment occurs at bar @xmath79 .",
    "this is the first bar of the second theme s exposition in section @xmath75 .",
    "the maximum thus coincides with the tonal transition between the two themes , from c major to g major . in the second segment ,",
    "the maximum is at bar @xmath54 , the last bar in the f major part of section @xmath77 . here",
    ", again , the js divergence is detecting a tonality change , from f major to c major .    at the next segmentation level , shown in the lower panel of figure [ k545 ]",
    ", the js divergence reveals more subtle tonal structures .",
    "still , one of the maxima corresponds to a tonality change . in the third segment ,",
    "the maximum at bar @xmath80 coincides with the boundary between sections @xmath76 and @xmath77 , with a modulation from d minor to f major . at this level , thus , the three sonata sections become separated from each other .",
    "the maximum in the first segment , at bar @xmath81 , discriminates between the bulk of the first theme , in c major , and two bars where the modulation to the second theme s g major takes place . in the second segment ,",
    "the maximum is at bar @xmath82 .",
    "this divides the presentation of the simple second theme s melodic line from the ensuing episode , a rather long series of arpeggio figures .",
    "the tonal progression in this episode has the form of a sequence of fifths , a well - known procedure by which the composition passes between several , slightly different tonality contexts .",
    "this relative tonal richness contrasts with the second theme s line .",
    "finally , the maximum in the fourth segment at bar @xmath83 separates the re - exposition of the second time in section @xmath77 , in the tonality of c major , from the coda .",
    "this last segment begins at bar @xmath84 with the use of a rather special tone combination , a diminished seventh cord , which before the relaxation of the final bars establishes a moment of tonal tension , clearly detected by js divergence .",
    "at the three levels , the maxima in the js divergence are above the intervals @xmath71 , shown in figure [ k545 ] by horizontal lines .",
    "those intervals , however , are relatively wider than in the case of the symbolic sequence considered in section [ lit ] .",
    "this can be ascribed to the fact that the whole musical sequence , as well as any of its segments , are considerable shorter than those of literary origin , which enhances the effect of fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , all the segmentations performed on the musical sequence can be confidently associated with significant divergence in the symbol frequencies .",
    "we have illustrated the application of a segmentation algorithm , based on the comparison of the compositional difference between segments through the jensen - shannon divergence , to symbolic sequences of literary and musical origin .",
    "the main aim has been to test whether a method already used to detect structural heterogeneities in arrays of symbols conveying information specifically , dna sequences was able to produce any significant result when applied to sequences derived from information processing at a much higher level , such as in human languages .",
    "the answer is positive : most of the segments resulting from the application of the algorithm can be clearly identified with contextual domains inherent to the standard structure of the literary and musical works from where the analyzed sequences were extracted .",
    "other segments , whose interpretation requires effectively inspecting the changes in the frequency of symbols along the sequence , point out more subtle patterns , specific to the works in question . in all cases , however , the segmentation procedure has amply fulfilled the significance criterion used to discern long - range compositional divergence from random - like local fluctuations .",
    "the present segmentation algorithm has been able to detect , by means of an unsupervised procedure , most of the structural division of a theatrical play into acts and scenes , as designed by the play s author . for the sequence of musical origin",
    ", it has been able to disclose the same tonal patterns that would arise from the analysis performed by a purposefully educated human .",
    "this suggests that such analysis could be automatized , and eventually used as a helpful instrument in such tasks as information processing , classification , and retrieval in digitalized corpora and databases .",
    "it is however clear that human intervention is expected at least at two stages .",
    "first , an intelligent choice is needed for the translation of a generic message into a symbolic sequence , which may depend on the kind of contextual information to be extracted .",
    "second , as illustrated in the case of the sequence of literary origin , the full interpretation of results may require their further elaboration and comparison with information from other sources .",
    "on the other hand , our contribution shows that significant results can be obtained from an information - theoretical analysis of such objects as literary or musical works which , traditionally , are treated by means of less quantitative methods .",
    "the complementarity of both approaches should emphasize the interdisciplinary interest of the present study .",
    "i would like to thank ana majtey , from universidad nacional de crdoba , argentina , for pointing out the jensen - shannon divergence as a tool for the analysis of symbolic sequences ."
