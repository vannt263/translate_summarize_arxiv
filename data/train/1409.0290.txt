    "determinations of atomic and molecular structural properties have a long tradition in physical sciences . some quantities , such as atomic energy level positions and ground state hyperfine",
    "coupling constants can , and have been , experimentally determined to extraordinary precision . on the other hand ,",
    "excited state properties such as , for instance , excited - state hyperfine coupling constants , multipole matrix elements or other parameters that depend on such matrix elements ( such as atomic polarizabilities ) , can normally be measured to much lower precision .",
    "for example , atomic dipole matrix elements have been measured in the best cases to only several parts in @xmath1 @xcite .    over the past decade ,",
    "there have been two important motivating factors for more precise determinations of atomic dipole matrix elements .",
    "one of these is the need to extract weak interaction coupling constants from atomic physics parity violation measurements in atomic cesium and francium @xcite .",
    "another is the need in precision measurements for so - called magic - wavelength optical dipole traps @xcite . in such traps ,",
    "the trap - induced light shift is the same for two states of the system under study , permitting long and nearly perturbation - free measurement times , among other things . in each of these cases , calculating the necessary atomic quantities for a given atomic system requires a large number of very - well - known dipole matrix elements . for this reason ,",
    "precise measurements of accessible atomic parameters is essential to provide fiducial or benchmark values to assess the reliability of theoretical approaches used to calculate them .",
    "benchmark values of matrix elements provide one measure of such reliability .",
    "similarly , measurements of atomic hyperfine coupling constants , which provide information on nuclear charge or current distributions , also give a measure of electronic wave functions at small distances from the nucleus , where relativistic effects on the wave functions are quite influential .",
    "in this paper we describe and apply an extension of a pump - probe hyperfine quantum beats approach developed earlier @xcite . in previous measurements ,",
    "a short - pulse linearly polarized pump beam generated an initial value of electronic alignment components @xmath2 in an excited atomic level . here",
    "the subscript @xmath3 is a component index .",
    "the alignment components evolve in time according to @xmath2@xmath4 , where @xmath4 is a time - dependent coefficient that contains the hyperfine coupling constants .",
    "measurement of time dependence of @xmath2@xmath4 allows extraction of excited state hyperfine coupling constants at a relative precision @xmath5 @xmath1 , even in cases where the hyperfine splittings are masked by the natural width of the excited level .",
    "previously , @xmath2@xmath4 was experimentally determined by time - delayed and polarization - dependent probing with a short - pulse probe laser tuned to a more energetic excited state level .",
    "although this approach works well in many cases , it becomes increasingly difficult to generate an optical probe when the probed level has to be close to the ionization level of the atom under study .",
    "one of several possible approaches to overcoming this limitation , and one that we introduce here , is to probe the time - dependent alignment by stimulated emission probing to a lower energy level . with this approach , it is possible to access energetically high lying atomic or molecular level , and yet probe via optical optical double resonance to a level that provides a convenient fluorescence channel for detection .",
    "the remainder of this report is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe the experimental approach , including the general scheme , and experimental details as necessary .",
    "this is followed by the details of the analysis required to extract the hyperfine coupling constants .",
    "the measurement and analysis results are presented in the next section , along with comparisons with earlier measurements of the hyperfine coupling constants for the atomic cs @xmath6 level .",
    "in this section we give a brief overview of the experimental scheme and arrangement that was used to perform the experiments . the basic scheme is illustrated by the partial energy level diagram for @xmath7cs in figure 1 . from the figure",
    ", we refer to resonant laser excitation of the @xmath6 level as the pump transition , and subsequent stimulated emission on the @xmath6 @xmath8 @xmath9 as the probe transition .",
    "cascade fluorescence from the @xmath9 level populates the @xmath10 level nearly exclusively , which subsequently decays by spontaneous emission to the @xmath11 level .",
    "this decay channel then serves as a convenient monitor of the initial excitation process .",
    "@xmath12    [ fig1 ]    tunable dye lasers to excite the pump and probe transitions are pumped by a pulsed neodymium - doped yttrium aluminum garnet ( nd : yag ) laser , operating simultaneously at 532 nm and at 355 nm .",
    "the pulse repetition rate is 20 hz .",
    "this laser is used to drive two home - built tunable dye lasers , the so - called pump and probe lasers .",
    "the pump laser is used for excitation of the @xmath6 level at 387.92 nm and the probe laser is used to stimulate emission from the @xmath6 level to the @xmath9 level at 894.72 nm .",
    "each dye laser is highly linearly polarized through use of glan - thompson calcite prism polarizers having extinction ratios of better than 10@xmath13 .",
    "the dye laser cavities are of the grazing incidence littman - metcalf design .",
    "a temperature - controlled liquid crystal variable retarder ( lcr ) is used to electronically vary the linear polarization direction of the probe laser to be parallel or perpendicular to that of the pump laser .",
    "the average power of the lasers is @xmath14 1 mw and lasers are collimated to a beam diameter of about 0.3 cm .",
    "polarization switching of the lcr was achieved by applying the necessary voltage to the retarder via a computer - controlled liquid crystal digital interface .",
    "the beams of the pump and probe pulsed dye lasers propagate collinearly , but in opposite directions , into the interaction region of the cesium sample cell .",
    "a resistively heated nonmagnetic cylindrical aluminum oven was used to generate the desired vapor pressure of atomic cs in the cell .",
    "the oven , which houses the pyrex cell containing cesium vapor , was wrapped with an aluminum oxide blanket to maintain the temperature at @xmath15c with the uncertainty under @xmath16c via a temperature controller .",
    "@xmath17    [ fig1 ]    the intensities of the cascade fluorescence from the @xmath10 level to the ground @xmath11 level were recorded at 852.12 nm by using an infrared sensitive cooled photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) which was located at right angles to the propagation directions of the lasers .",
    "a combination of interference and color glass filters was used in front of the pmt in order to remove background light .",
    "all the cables used in the experiment were electrically shielded and the optical table was grounded in order to eliminate electronic pick - up and noise on the observed signal .    the recorded signal collected for each state of laser polarization consists of 100x10@xmath18 data points accumulated during 4 seconds .",
    "the boxcar integrator / averager was set to average every 100 data samples , where each sample of the data set is continuous over a 50 ms time period . since the lifetimes of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 levels are shorter than the lifetime of the @xmath6 level ( 305 ns  @xcite ) we distinguished the signal from the background which consists of the spontaneous emission decay of the atoms from the @xmath6 level to the lower levels .",
    "the output of the pmt was amplified using a two - stage amplifier and processed in the boxcar integrator / averager with a 50-ns gate - width , opened after a 10 ns delay following the laser pulses . the boxcar integrator operated in a 30 sample averaging mode , where the average single - shot level within the detection gate is digitized .",
    "our typical signal size is about 10@xmath19 photons for each laser pulse .",
    "the digitized signals were stored on a computer using a labview program while monitoring the size of the signal within the gate - width in real time using a digital oscilloscope operating at 500 mhz with 2 gsa / s .",
    "comparison of the signals , detected when the probe polarization angle is @xmath20 = 0 versus @xmath20 = @xmath21/2 allows definition of a linear polarization degree .",
    "in particular , from the measurements , a linear polarization degree is formed from the measured intensities i(@xmath20=0 ) and i(@xmath20 = @xmath21/2 ) according to    @xmath22    @xmath23 , whose value can depend on the hyperfine energy separations in the probed @xmath6 level , is the main quantity to be further analyzed in the experiment .",
    "as we see in the following section @xmath23 depends experimentally on the time delay between the pump and probe laser beams .",
    "this time delay is generated by construction of an optical delay line , from which the geometrical properties yield a variable time delay .",
    "although not very convenient for long delays , an optical delay line has the advantage of generating a time base that is both of the necessary precision and largely free of important systematic errors .",
    "linear polarization measurements depend mainly on the absolute intensity ratio of the signals for two different polarization directions of the lasers , and are quite insensitive to other experimental factors . therefore , any variations of the laser intensities with experimental factors such as absorbing medium density , fluorescence background , and sensitivity of the gated boxcar averager generally have negligible effect on the intensity ratio .",
    "laser power and temperature tests show that the amplified spontaneous emission , stimulated raman scattering , radiation trapping or other phenomena do not affect the measured linear polarization .      in the previous section we defined a linear polarization degree in terms of measured quantities .",
    "here we sketch the necessary theoretical results with which the the experimental measurements are to be further analyzed to obtain the hyperfine coupling constants associated with the atomic cs @xmath6 level .    in the present experiment , excitation of the atomic cs @xmath6 level",
    "is made with linearly polarized light tuned to the @xmath11@xmath8@xmath6 level .",
    "further , the bandwidth of the optical excitation is much larger than the hyperfine splitting in the final level .",
    "this means that the excited level may be characterized by an overall population and the axially symmetric electronic alignment tensor component @xmath24 .",
    "thus , measured intensities in eq .",
    "2.1 can be defined in terms of alignment and general analysis of this situation  @xcite yields the following expression for the linear polarization degree associated with the stimulated emission probing described in the previous section .",
    "@xmath25    we described in detail the definition of the intensity of emitted radiation in terms of average electronic alignment in our earlier two - photon polarization spectroscopy experiments  @xcite . in the above expression , @xmath26 is a coefficient which is unique to each optical transition from an electronic level of atomic angular momentum @xmath27 to @xmath28 . in the present case ,",
    "@xmath27 = 3/2 and @xmath28 = 5/2 , these associated with the stimulated transition @xmath6 @xmath8 @xmath9 . here , @xmath26 = -1/4 .",
    "further , we create by optical excitation on the @xmath11 @xmath8 @xmath6 transition an initial value of electronic alignment @xmath29 = -4/5 . in the absence of further disturbance",
    "this quantity evolves in time according to @xmath30 = @xmath31 , where the quantity @xmath4 is given by the following expression :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the time delay between creation of the alignment , the symbol @xmath34 is a 6-j coefficient , @xmath35 is the hyperfine frequency of the splitting between the @xmath36 and @xmath37 hyperfine energy sublevels .",
    "the nuclear spin of @xmath38 is @xmath39 = 7/2 . for the present case , the theoretical expression for the linear polarization degree",
    "is given by    @xmath40    here the time dependent depolarization coefficient @xmath4 is given by    @xmath41 \\\\ \\nonumber & + & 0.2009\\ cos\\left[2\\pi\\nu_{24}t\\right ] \\\\",
    "\\nonumber & + & 0.0375\\ cos\\left[2\\pi\\nu_{34}t\\right ] \\\\",
    "\\nonumber & + & 0.16042\\ cos\\left[2\\pi\\nu_{35}t\\right ] \\\\",
    "\\nonumber & + & 0.28875\\ cos\\left[2\\pi\\nu_{45}t\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in terms of the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole coupling constants a and b , the hyperfine frequencies to be inserted in this equation are given by    [ eq5 ] @xmath42    we finally point out that at @xmath33 = 0 , the depolarization coefficient @xmath43 = 1 .",
    "then the ideal linear polarization degree for very short times following excitation is given by @xmath23 = 1/7 ( 14.29% ) .",
    "as described in the previous section , the basic quantities obtained in the experiment are light intensities for the two cases when the exciting and probing linear polarization degrees are collinear or orthogonal .",
    "these quantities , along with their associated uncertainties , are measured as function of the time delay between the pump and probe lasers .",
    "the measured values are summarized in table 1 .",
    "[ table1 ]    .tabulation of measured time delay between the pump and the probe beams , the measured linear polarization degrees , and the associated estimated uncertainties .",
    "the estimated uncertainty in the time delay is about 0.16 ns for each time delay . [",

    "we have introduced a new technique to measure the hyperfine energy level separations in the 8p @xmath0 level of atomic cs .",
    "the approach is based on the influence of oscillating atomic multipoles in the excited states on the probe light polarization dependence of the stimulated emission rate to a lower energy level .",
    "we anticipate that this technique is applicable to measurements of small energy separations in many atomic systems .",
    "it further should be extremely useful for measuring structural properties of diatomic molecules , particularly rotational energy separations and finer structure within rotational levels ( hyperfine structure and lambda doubling for instance ) .",
    "the experimental approach , combination of pulsed optical pumping and time - delayed stimulated emission probing , has been used to measure the magnetic dipole ( a ) and electric quadrupole ( b ) hyperfine coupling constants in the atomic cs 8p @xmath0 level .",
