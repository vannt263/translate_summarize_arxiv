    "a recent information - theoretic breakthrough established that at the high signal - to - noise ( snr ) regime every user in a @xmath0-user wireless interference network can enjoy half the capacity of the interference free case @xcite .",
    "therefore , interference is not a fundamental limitation for such networks since it accounts for only constant scaling of the interference free case capacity , provided that it is sufficiently mitigated .",
    "such a surprising result is possible when interference alignment is employed .",
    "ia is a sophisticated technique first presented in @xcite and subsequently utilized in @xcite as a means of showing the achievability of @xmath1 degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) for the @xmath0-user interference channel .",
    "the dof of an interference channel can be interpreted as the number of interference free signaling dimensions , including time , frequency , or space .",
    "intuitively , ia serves as a means for obtaining as many interference free dimensions for communication as possible and in practice stands for designing the transmit and receive strategies for each user - receiver pair of a wireless network @xcite-@xcite . for the case of static flat - fading mimo channels , such as the ones studied in @xcite and @xcite , where both transmitter and receiver have perfect channel knowledge ,",
    "the flexibility is confined to designing the transmit precoding and receive zero - forcing matrices to maximize the achievable _ spatial _ dof .",
    "unfortunately , such matrices are np - hard to obtain @xcite , closed form solutions have been found only for a few special cases such as @xcite and @xcite , and the problem is open for limited dimensions @xcite . even characterizing",
    "the feasibility of perfect ia is a highly non - trivial task as discussed in recent work  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the hardness to either find perfect ia solutions or even decide for feasibility is the cost of the problem s over constrained nature .",
    "a review of the current status of ia techniques is presented in @xcite .    as an alternative to closed form designs ,",
    "several algorithmic approaches have been proposed in the literature such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "many of those methods aim to minimize the _ interference leakage _ at each receiver so that -at best case- interference alignment is perfectly attained .",
    "the suggested insight for their effectiveness is that when _ perfect _ interference alignment is possible , then interference leakage will be zero and such algorithms may obtain the optimal solutions .",
    "although a fair metric to optimize , as we show in this paper , interference leakage is not the tightest approximation to the notion of dof which is typically the desired objective . when perfect alignment of interferences is not attained , the objective remains to maximize the available spatial dof , that is the prelog factor of the capacity at the high - snr regime .    in this work",
    ", we present a variational characterazation of ia in terms of signal and interference space ranks .",
    "specifically , we pose full rank constraints on the useful signal spaces and minimize the rank of the interference spaces .",
    "the full rank constraints ensure useful signal spaces spanning all available spatial dimensions .",
    "the rank minimization guarantees interference spaces collapsing to the smallest dimensional subspaces possible .",
    "we show that under the full rank constraints , minimizing the sum of ranks of the interference matrices is equivalent to maximizing the sum of spatial dof for static flat - fading mimo systems . the variational characterization , even though it is harder to solve exactly than solving a set of bilinear equations for perfect ia as the ones in @xcite and @xcite , suggests a natural relaxation that leads to a good approximation algorithm .    hence , we establish a new heuristic for near optimal interference alignment and maximization of the sum of spatial dof . using results from @xcite and @xcite",
    "we suggest that the sum of the nuclear norms of the interference matrices is the best objective function in terms of convex functions and is equivalent to the @xmath2-norm of the singular values of the interference matrices .",
    "as intuition suggests , the @xmath2-norm minimization of the singular values of interference matrices will provide sparse solutions , translating to more interference free signaling dimensions .",
    "interestingly , we show that the leakage minimization techniques presented in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite minimize the @xmath3-norm of the singular values of the interference matrices which accounts for `` low '' energy solutions rather than sparse ones .",
    "to deal with the ( non - convex ) full rank constraints we suggest that positivity constraints on minimum eigenvalues of positive definite matrices serve as a well motivated approximation .",
    "an interesting aspect of our approach is its inherent robustness to a challenging caveat that the leakage minimization approaches face : for some cases of special interest , such as symbol extended single antenna interference channels , the iterative leakage minimization approaches may converge to zero dimensional , or rank deficient signal spaces , yielding zero or very low dof @xcite .",
    "this caveat is due to the fact that the beamforming and zeroforcing matrices for ia are constructed as a function only of the interference links .",
    "then , the randomness of the wireless medium is left to take care of the full rank signal space conditions , which it does when the channel matrices are full and do not have a specific structure .",
    "our nuclear norm heuristic avoids these singularities due to positivity constraints on eigenvalues , explicitly enforced on all signal spaces ; these constraints involve all direct links of the network .",
    "therefore , our approach can be used to generate interference alignment beamforming and zeroforcing matrices for any channel structure of interest .    then , we extend our approximation algorithm to the @xmath0-cell interference channel @xcite , where each cell consists of several users and show that additional affine constraints on the precoding matrices are posed .",
    "these affine constraints are tractable and can be added in a straightforward manner to our approximation , hence , we develop a similar convex programming approach .",
    "this approximation is once more motivated by the fact that ia can be posed as a rank constrained rank minimization on an interference channel with structural constraints on the beamforming matrices .",
    "the last section contains an experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm .",
    "our experiments suggest that the proposed scheme is sum - dof optimal for many setups where perfect ia is possible .",
    "furthermore , in some cases it provides extra dof compared to the leakage minimization approach , when perfect ia is not attained and is robust to singularities met by the leakage minimization approach on diagonal channel structures .",
    "we conclude with a discussion on further research directions .",
    "we consider static flat - fading @xmath0-user mimo interference wireless systems consisting of @xmath0 transmitters and @xmath0 receivers .",
    "we assume that each transmitting user is equipped with @xmath4 transmit antennas , each receiver with @xmath5 receive antennas , and all @xmath0 transmitting users are synchronizing their transmissions .",
    "each user , say @xmath6 , wishes to communicate a symbol vector @xmath7 to its associated receiver , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represents the `` pursued '' dof by user @xmath10 , that is the number of symbols it wishes to transmit . to aid intuition",
    ", we note that achievable dof can be perceived as the number of signal space dimensions that are _ free _ of interference .",
    "prior to transmitting , user @xmath6 linearly precodes its symbol vector to obtain @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the precoding matrix whose @xmath9 columns are linearly independent .",
    "we consider signal vectors with an expected power constraint @xmath13 , for all @xmath6 .",
    "the downconverted and pulse matched received signal at receiver @xmath10 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the channel `` processing '' between the @xmath16th user and the @xmath17th receiver and @xmath18 denotes the zero - mean complex additive white gaussian noise vector with covariance matrix @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "each receiver @xmath21 , linearly processes the received signal to obtain @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the corresponding linear zero - forcing filter with @xmath9 linearly independent columns .",
    "hence , @xmath24 constitutes the useful signal space in which receiver @xmath21 expects to observe the symbols transmitted by user @xmath10 , while @xmath25 is the space where all interference is observed .",
    "we denote by @xmath26 the horizontal concatenation of matrices @xmath27 .",
    "we denote this @xmath0-user mimo interference channel as an @xmath28 system , in the same manner as in @xcite , where all signal spaces span all available dimensions .",
    "for all the cases considered we assume @xmath29 .    for practical reasons one might consider @xmath30 , for all @xmath6 .",
    "this might be a setting where each column of @xmath31 represents a beamforming ( or signature ) vector assigned to a user in a group ( or a cell ) of @xmath9 users and enforces orthogonality among user signal subspaces .",
    "accordingly , we may as well assume that the columns of each zero - forcing filter @xmath32 , for all receivers @xmath6 , form an @xmath9-dimensional orthonormal basis , if practical interest requires such a construction .",
    "we note that for simplicity we made the assumption that the number of transmit antenna elements are the same at all transmitters or receivers and all users wish to transmit @xmath33 symbols .",
    "however , the results that follow can be easily carried to the case where transmitters and receivers might not have the same number of antennas .",
    "in this section we show that for each user @xmath6 , the maximum achievable dof can be put in the form of an rcrm problem .",
    "we suggest a new optimization framework for the interference alignment problem instead of the one for _ perfect _ ia as presented in @xcite .",
    "the optimization aims for the maximum interference suppression possible , when the signal space of each user is required to span exactly @xmath9 spatial dimensions worth of communication .",
    "the perfect ia conditions being stricter require that interference signals are nulled out using linear processing of the received signal at each receiver , when the useful signal space spans @xmath9 dimensions . to generalize the perfect ia framework , we use ranks of matrices to account for the number of useful signaling and interference dimensions .",
    "interestingly , we show that the rcrm formulation is equivalent to the sum dof maximization in an @xmath34 system , where each useful signal space spans @xmath9 dimensions",
    ". then , we use this framework to develop a new approximation algorithm and compare its tightness to existing interference leakage minimization approaches .",
    "we begin by stating the perfect ia requirements . in an @xmath34 system and for all @xmath35 perfect ia",
    "requires that @xmath36 where ( [ req1 ] ) enforces all interference spaces to have zero dimensions posterior to zero - forcing and ( [ req2 ] ) enforces the useful signal to span all @xmath9 dimensions .",
    "observe that ( [ req1 ] ) is a set of bilinear equations in the unknown precoding and zero - forcing filters .",
    "recently , a feasibility question has been raised as to whether a system admits perfect interference alignment or not . when the channel coefficients are selected randomly and independently",
    ", @xcite claimed that proper systems should have a perfect alignment solution almost surely .",
    "an @xmath34 system is called _ proper _ , i.e. perfect ia is expected to be feasible almost surely , when the number of variables is less than or equal to the number of equations , and this is equivalent to @xmath37 .    interestingly ,",
    "if we look at the problem of finding the precoding and zero - forcing matrices when the channel coefficients are arbitrary and given , the problem is computationally intractable .",
    "in particular , razaviyayn _ et al _ recently established that for an arbitrary @xmath0-user mimo interference channel , checking the achievability of a certain dof tuple @xmath38 is np - hard when each user and transmitter has more than @xmath39 antennas @xcite .",
    "therefore , solving the perfect ia set of bilinear equations in a single - shot manner can not be performed efficiently , in the general case .",
    "additionally , scenaria of multiple symbol extensions for the mimo case , or multi - cell systems as the ones presented in @xcite , lack a similar definition to a proper system , however the sum dof maximization is still an achievement one should be aiming for .",
    "hence , it is interesting to obtain a more general framework for the ia problem that not only captures the notion of what are the maximum dof conditions , but also quantifies what one should be optimizing to achieve this dof . of course , a hard optimization problem might be equivalently or even harder than solving a set of bilinear equations .",
    "however , generalizing the formulation will provide helpful cues for good approximation schemes and better understanding of the problem .",
    "we continue with rewriting ( [ req1 ] ) @xmath40&=\\left[{\\bf 0}_{d\\times d}\\ldots{\\bf 0}_{d\\times d}\\right]\\\\ \\leftrightarrow { \\bf u}_k^h\\left[\\left\\{{\\bf h}_{k , l}{\\bf v}_l\\right\\}_{l=1,l\\ne k}^k\\right]&={\\bf 0}_{d\\times ( k-1)d } , \\nonumber \\end{split}\\ ] ] and defining the _ signal _ and _ interference _",

    "the space spanned by the columns of @xmath44 is the space in which the @xmath10th receiver expects to observe the transmitted signal @xmath46 .",
    "accordingly , the space spanned by the columns of @xmath45 accounts for the interference space at receiver @xmath6 .",
    "now , we restate ( [ req1 ] ) and ( [ req2 ] ) in terms of ranks @xmath47 for all @xmath21 .    to motivate the rank notation we use the following lemma to characterizes the spatial degrees of freedom for a given user @xmath10 of an @xmath28 static flat - fading mimo interference system .",
    "let @xmath48 be a given set of precoding filters and @xmath32 be a given zero - forcing filter employed by user @xmath6 .",

    "the above result is possible due to the eigenvalues of the @xmath54 and @xmath55 scaling linearly with @xmath56 for given precoding , zero - forcing , and channel matrices .",
    "@xmath57 + lemma 1 implies that to maximize the per user dof we have to design transmit and receive strategies in a sophisticated way , such that this difference of ranks is maximized .",
    "more precisely , for an @xmath28 system where each user aims for @xmath9 dof , the following set of @xmath0 `` parallel '' rank constrained rank minimization problems has to be solved @xmath58 it is obvious , that when perfect ia is possible ( [ minreq1 ] ) and ( [ minreq2 ] ) will find it , or else the best possible solution will be obtained for user @xmath6 , which will be equal to @xmath59    as noted before , for the constant @xmath0-user mimo interference channel it is known that the maximum per user achievable dof using linear precoding and zeroforcing schemes is @xmath60 , almost surely @xcite , hence aiming for more than @xmath61 seems unmotivated . in that regard , when aiming for @xmath62 , we should expect that optimally the rank of each interference can go down to zero , as perfect ia requires . hence , why use the rank formulation ? as we see in the following ,",
    "the fact that the rank formulation completely captures the notion of per user dof assists us in tightly approximating this objective .",
    "the nature of our approximation favors solutions where the interference has low rank ( i.e. , users get higher dof ) , instead of low energy ( i.e. , small interference leakage ) .",
    "this is of particular interest when perfect ia is feasible but hard to obtain , or for interference channels where the notion of proper is not clearly defined , such as cellular networks .",
    "apparently , it is not trivial to solve in parallel a set of the @xmath0 optimization problems in ( [ minreq1 ] ) and ( [ minreq2 ] ) .",

    "interestingly , our approach is robust with respect to channel structures since it explicitly involves a positivity constraint on the minimum eigenvalue of the signal space matrix , that is ( [ req2 ] ) will always hold for _ any _ set of channel matrices .    to conclude this section ,",
    "we have introduced an alternating nuclear norm minimization scheme to approximate the sum dof maximization in the @xmath10-user mimo interference channel .",
    "our approximation is motivated by our rcrm formulation for the sum dof maximization , when useful signal spaces span all available dimensions . in our approach",
    ", we relax the rank cost function to its convex envelope , the nuclear norm of interference singular values .",
