    "e.  g. , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) that the counting current is conserved .      in a typical mesoscopic transport problem",

    "terminals provide boundary conditions to green s function far away from the scattering region .",
    "these are usually determined by external current or voltage sources and include material properties like superconductivity .",
