    "studies of correlated electron systems have led to the discovery of many novel ordered phases , sometimes characterized by subtle broken symmetries .",
    "it is often challenging , however , to understand these ordered phases , as it is a common problem that no experimental probe couples in a simple way to the microscopic order parameter .",
    "this makes it difficult to determine how the order manifests itself in terms of the quantum states of the electrons , and sometimes even to determine how strong the order is .",
    "for example , the true nature of spin arrangements in antiferromagnets was  hidden \" for several decades , until the development of neutron diffraction as a probe that couples to the order parameter @xcite .",
    "there are several modern examples of hidden order , which are among the most active topics of investigation in the field of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "these include electronic nematics ",
    "states that are characterized macroscopically as translationally invariant electronic states that break the rotational symmetry of a crystal  and exotic superconducting states .",
    "it is believed that nematic states arise from fluctuating density waves , but in systems of interest such as the bi - layer ruthenate sr@xmath4ru@xmath5o@xmath6 , quantum hall systems , and some cuprate and iron - pnictide superconductors , the microscopic nature of these broken - symmetry electronic states has not been directly observed @xcite . in systems such as the heavy fermion superconductor upt@xmath4 , the order parameter can be difficult to determine , because there are no available probes that couple directly to the gap function @xcite .    electric multipole order of the kind observed in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 is a type of hidden order widely observed in @xmath2-electron materials @xcite , in which the electron density around some atoms in the unit cell spontaneously distorts in a repeating pattern throughout the crystal .",
    "the change in electron density is a very small perturbation of the total electron density , so that traditional probes such as x - rays couple only very weakly .",
    "neutron scattering may couple indirectly to multipolar order if there is an admixture of magnetic dipole as well as charge order , or if there is a sufficiently large lattice distortion @xcite but there are cases of quadrupolar order where neutron diffraction patterns are unchanged upon entry into an afq phase @xcite .",
    "a well - known example of a system with hidden order that may be due to multipolar charge ordering is uru@xmath5si@xmath5 , for which several different varieties of multipolar order , from quadrupolar to hexadecapolar , as well as a number of other scenarios , have been proposed @xcite . here",
    ", we show that precise measurements of the volume of the fermi surface can reflect the modified charge density of multipolar - ordered states , allowing such order to be measured at very low temperatures .",
    "in multipolar order , degenerate or nearly degenerate localized electronic states form superpositions that lower the energy of the ground state . in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 , the material we study , antiferroquadrupolar ( afq ) order arises in the doubly occupied @xmath7-electron shell of the pr ions .",

    "application of a magnetic field causes the ground state to acquire a small admixture of the @xmath14 triplet state , @xmath15 , and , more importantly , it splits the @xmath16 members of the triplet state , so that the spin - up branch of the triplet , @xmath17 , crosses @xmath11 near 8 t @xcite , as shown schematically in fig .",

    "the dhva effect has played a prominent role in condensed matter physics since it s discovery over 80 years ago but this capability has not previously been exploited and may have important applications , in particular because of the excellent sensistivity of the dhva technique at millikelvin temperatures .",

    "the residual resistivity ratio , defined as the ratio of the zero - field resistance at room temperature to that extrapolated to absolute zero , measured on samples from the same batch , fell in the range 70 to 80 .",
    "the crystal was heat - sunk to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator through an annealed silver wire that was soldered to one corner of the sample .",
    "the dhva effect was measured using the standard field - modulation technique with second - harmonic detection , with the sample in an astatic pair of pick - up coils .",
    "the modulation frequency was 6 hz , with modulation field amplitudes of 0.0126 t for fields from 2.5 to 8 t , and 0.021 t for fields from 7 to 18 t. the signal from the pick - up coils was measured using a lock - in amplifier , via a low - temperature transformer with a turns ratio of approximately 100 , and a low noise preamplifier .",
    "the sample and pick - up coils were placed in a graphite rotation mechanism with a rotation range of approximately 90@xmath33 .",
    "measurements were performed with @xmath27 parallel to both the ( 110 ) and ( 100 ) crystallographic directions . in this paper , only the former measurements are reported because @xmath34 is lower along the ( 110 ) direction , and quantum oscillations were therefore better resolved across the entire afq phase for @xmath22 .",

    "the amplitude @xmath42 is given by the lifshitz - kosevich expression @xmath43 the important factors in this expression are : the spin damping term @xmath44 , which arises from the interference of the quantum oscillations from the spin - up and spin - down branches of the fermi surface ; the dingle factor @xmath45 , which accounts for damping of quasiparticles by scattering , where @xmath46 is the cyclotron radius and @xmath47 is the quasiparticle mean free path ; and the cyclotron frequency @xmath48 .",

[ fig - oscs]b consists of sharp peaks arising from well - defined extremal areas of the fermi surface , and , indeed , sharp peaks corresponding to the low frequency oscillation of fig  [ fig - oscs]a can be seen below 0.3 kt .",
    "the @xmath3 peak , however , is a broad clump of peaks .",

    "this is shown in appendix 1 .",
    "in particular , unlike @xmath70 , @xmath69 does not depend on the field - derivative of @xmath40 .",
    "thus @xmath69 is easier to interpret than @xmath70 : when @xmath83 increases , the fermi surface is expanding , and vice - versa .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - phivst ] , we plot @xmath69 at several magnetic fields spanning the afq phase , finding large , systematic and often non - monotonic temperature dependence .",
    "according to our intepretation of the @xmath65 data in fig .",
    "[ fig - fvsb ] , these changes reflect the relative occupancies of @xmath11 and 4p .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , although the changes we observe in @xmath84 are proportional to changes in @xmath85 , the magnetization is not _ causing _ the changes in @xmath40 . what we see as a single quantum oscillation frequency is actually the superposition of oscillations from spin - up and spin - down branches of the fermi surface , which have very nearly the same back - projected oscillation frequency @xcite .",
    "changing the polarized magnetic moment on the localized @xmath7 states will produce a contribution to the spin splitting of these branches of the fermi surface , additional to the pauli paramagnetic spin splitting that the applied magnetic field alone would produce .",
    "however , it will not change their _ average _ back - projected dhva frequency , which is what we observe .",
    "the field and temperature dependence of @xmath86 must primarily reflect changes in the _ charge _ distribution on the pr @xmath2-orbital as the relative occupation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 changes .",
    "this is important because it means that , even if the crystal field levels were both non - magnetic singlets , the fermi volume measurement would still be sensitive to changes in their occupancy , although the magnetisation @xmath58 would not .",
    "if we examine the temperature dependence of @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ fig - phivst ] , much of this behaviour can be easily understood within the existing model of the crystal field states of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 , when we consider that the @xmath3-sheet expands when the occupancy of @xmath11 increases at the expense of 4p , and vice - versa .",
    "thus , for magnetic fields below the lower boundary of the afq phase ( at 4.25 t , for example ) @xmath83 decreases monotonically ( the @xmath3 fermi surface contracts ) with increasing @xmath35 because the 4p state is becoming thermally occupied at the expense of the @xmath11 ground state . for fields above the upper boundary of the afq phase ( e.g.  13 t ) we see the opposite behaviour because the relative positions of @xmath11 and 4p are now reversed : @xmath83 _ increases _ monotonically ( the @xmath3 fermi surface expands ) with increasing @xmath35 because pr @xmath7 electrons are being thermally excited from the 4p ground state to the @xmath11 excited state .    for magnetic fields corresponding to the afq region , the behaviour of @xmath69 is more complicated , but we assume that it still reflects the relative occupations of the crystal field states as we have described . for @xmath87 there is a maximum in @xmath69 at the afq thermal phase boundary @xmath34 .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvst ] , as well as in several curves in fig .",
    "[ fig - phivst ] . as noted in the introduction ,",
    "afq order involves a superposition at each pr site of the form @xmath88 , where @xmath19 indexes the afq sublattice and @xmath20 indexes the triplet crystal - field sublevels ( see appendix 2 )",
    ". as the temperature increases in this field and temperature range , the amplitude of the afq order parameter decreases .",
    "this is reflected in a decrease in the @xmath89 and a corresponding increase in @xmath90 : 4p is higher in energy than @xmath11 , so its incorporation into the ground state costs crystal field energy that can only be compensated by afq energy .",
    "thus , as @xmath35 increases towards @xmath34 , the occupancy of @xmath11 increases at the expense of @xmath12 , and the @xmath3 fermi surface expands . for @xmath91 , afq order",
    "is gone , and there is an incoherent , thermal superposition of the crystal field states on the pr sites .",
    "the occupation of @xmath11 therefore _ falls _ while that of 4p rises , as pr 4f electrons are thermally excited into the 4p state causing the @xmath3 fermi surface to shrink and @xmath69 to fall .",
    "the non - monotonic behaviour of @xmath69 thus reflects a change in regime from coherent superposition to incoherent thermal occupation of crystal field states .",
    "for @xmath92 , we would expect this situation to be reversed due to the crystal field level - crossing , producing a _ minimum _ in @xmath69 at @xmath34 .",
    "this minimum is observed up to 9.75  t , but above this field we see @xmath83 , and therefore @xmath11 occupancy , monotonically increasing with increasing @xmath35 at all temperatures , even within the afq phase .",
    "we do not fully understand this behaviour , but it appears to signal a change in the afq ground state in this field region , perhaps to an admixture of the different @xmath12 states with very little @xmath11 , consistent with previous suggestions that the ordered structure changes at a first - order phase transition within the afq phase ( shown as the higher - field purple line in fig .  [ fig - phasedia])@xcite",
    ".    temperature dependence of fermi surface areas is a subject that has only rarely been discussed with respect to quantum oscillations @xcite , and such a strongly temperature dependent phase , particularly a non - monotonic variation of @xmath69 , has not to our knowledge been previously reported .",
    "this does not mean that temperature dependence of the fermi surface is uncommon , but the usual way of analysing dhva oscillations using fourier transforms could cause such temperature dependent phases to have gone unnoticed .",
    "application of eq .",
    "[ eq - deltaphi ] to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig - phivst ] illustrates how sensitive the dhva phase is to variations in fermi surface area : a tiny change in @xmath40 leads to a large change in @xmath56 . at 10  t , for example",
    ", @xmath83 reaches about 11 radians at 2.5 k , which corresponds to a change in @xmath40 of only @xmath93% .",
    "the high sensitivity of the dhva technique , particularly at millikelvin temperatures , has allowed us to observe some unexpected behaviour in the @xmath94 k limit .",
    "figure [ fig - phivst]b shows that there is a clear difference between data outside the afq phase ( at 4.25  t , 4.5  t , 12.5  t and 13.0  t ) , in which @xmath69 approaches @xmath95 k with zero slope , and data within the afq phase , which show a distinctly positive slope as @xmath96 k. we have found similar behaviour with the magnetic field parallel to the ( 100 ) direction ( data not shown ) .",
    "the sign of the @xmath96 slope is positive everywhere within the afq phase , independent of whether the magnetic field is higher or lower than the singlet - triplet level crossing near 8 t. the change in the slope of @xmath69 at low temperature can be seen very clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvst ] , setting in near 250 mk .    in a mean - field picture ,",
    "the afq order parameter should saturate as @xmath96 k , so the naive expectation is that the occupancy of @xmath11 and @xmath12 should stop changing with temperature . in terms of afq order , @xmath79",
    "should , therefore , have a slope that goes to zero for @xmath97 , rather than a slope that _ increases _ , as we observe .",
    "although the behaviour we observe is not expected , a hint as to its origin can be found in thermal expansion measurements , which also showed temperature dependence for @xmath97 , a result that was ascribed to the nuclear hyperfine interaction @xcite .",
    "the nuclear hyperfine interaction normally has a negligible effect on crystal field levels , but is enhanced in pr compounds with singlet ground states @xcite .",

    "the @xmath101 term , and the fact that @xmath102 for @xmath11 , means that the hyperfine splitting will be proportional to the amount of 4p in the electronic ground state . a key point , however , is that the off - diagonal @xmath103 and @xmath104 terms mix 4p and @xmath11 , so that , within the hyperfine manifold , different states can have differing weights of 4p and @xmath11 , with the hyperfine ground state expected to have the most 4p .",
    "outside the afq phase this mixing is weak because @xmath11 and 4p are separated in energy , so the perturbation is second order in @xmath105 . within the afq phase , however ,",
    "the ground state is a superposition of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , so there is a first - order matrix element and the mixing is much stronger , i.e.  it is proportional to @xmath106 , rather than @xmath107 .    within this picture ,",
    "the low temperature contraction of the @xmath3 fermi surface within the afq phase can be understood : for temperatures above about 300 mk , all of the hyperfine states of the ground state manifold are equally thermally populated , but as @xmath35 falls towards 0 k the lower hyperfine states , which have more 4p character , become preferentially occupied . because the @xmath3 fermi surface ` does nt like ' @xmath12 , ( as we have discussed above ) it shrinks . in appendix 2",
    "we present a toy model that illustrates and supports this interpretation . the observed effect on",
    "the fermi surface is only of the order of 0.08% of @xmath40 , but is still easily observed by quantum oscillations : at several magnetic field values , the hyperfine interaction is actually a stronger influence on the admixture of @xmath11 and 4p than the afq order .",
    "we note that the hyperfine interaction may have a profound effect on the phase transition line at the quantum critical point marking the lower boundary of the afq phase , since hyperfine mixing should stabilize the afq order .",
    "thus we would expect that the phase line could show deviations from the predictions of simple afq theory in the low mk temperature range .",
    "there may also be enhanced nuclear adiabatic demagnetization effects on crossing the afq phase boundary .",
    "we are not aware of any other technique that can so sensitively detect changes in electronic states in this low temperature regime , although similar conclusions could perhaps be drawn from similarly detailed thermal expansion measurements , if they were performed .",
    "we note that the exact energy splitting of the hyperfine levels will be very sensitive to the electronic states that form the hidden order in a multipolar system , so it may be possible , by detailed fitting of the temperature dependence , to test models of hidden order electronic states .",
    "this is an interesting possibility in other hidden order systems .",
    "in conclusion , we have observed a qualitatively new effect in quantum oscillations , which arises from the temperature dependent expansion and contraction of a fermi surface as the population of localized electronic states changes .",
    "this very sensitive method of measuring the temperature dependence of the fermi volume has allowed us to map the relative occupation of crystal field levels in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 , including the change from boltzmann - type thermal occupation to the coherent superposition of crystal field levels that signals afq order in this material .",

    "[ eq : lk ] ) .",
    "because @xmath28 appears in combination with @xmath110 , it can not be extracted from the observed quantum oscillation frequency @xcite . to see this , consider a field sweep centered on a field @xmath81 , and expand @xmath86 to first order in @xmath111 : @xmath112 where we have used the shorthand notation @xmath113 .",
    "the frequency @xmath114 is called the  back - projected \" frequency , and it is the frequency that is observed in a quantum oscillation measurement .",

    "[ fig - fvsb]b .",
    "the blue curve gives a possible field dependence of the fermi surface cross - sectional area : we hypothesize that the @xmath3 fermi surface shrinks continuously with increasing field , but the slope is more negative within the afq region .",

    "the reason that @xmath55 jumps up when the afq phase is entered is not because @xmath40 itself changes suddenly , but rather because its slope changes suddenly , causing the back - projection to jump . this hypothesis is supported by the field - dependence of the magnetization , which looks similar to the blue curve ( but with a positive slope ) @xcite .",

    "however , in the case of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 , the rapid field dependence of the fermi surface in some regions ( e.g.  at the boundaries of the afq phase ) led us to restrict our analysis to very narrow field ranges , and fitting the frequency of only a few oscillations is inherently noisy , as can be seen in fig .",

    "then , showing the field dependence explicitly so that the back - projection can be included at the appropriate time , we write @xmath123 that is , a small correction to the frequency of an oscillation can , over a range of a few periods , be accurately be treated as a phase shift , @xmath124 and @xmath125 with e.g.  @xmath126 t , @xmath127 t and @xmath128 t , over the range @xmath129 . ]",

    "of course , the occupancies of the hyperfine states will eventually saturate , and the fermi surface will become temperature independent , but , in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 , this may not happen until low millikelvin temperatures are reached .",

    ", we find that this translates to a fractional change of the extremal area of @xmath169 , which is three orders of magnitude larger than the effect we would predict using equation [ eq : dkf ] and the data in reference @xcite , and it has the wrong sign : rather than expanding , the fermi surface should shrink as @xmath170 increases .",
