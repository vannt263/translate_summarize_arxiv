    "the systematic behavior of the low - lying collective states of even - even nuclei has been extensively studied in different phenomenological and microscopic model approaches @xcite . in particular , some algebraic classification schemes provide a convenient way to systematize the general collective characteristics of these states in terms of the basic nuclear structure quantities , such as the nuclear mass number , the proton or neutron numbers , as well as the total number of neutron and proton pairs in nuclear valence shells @xcite . these quantities and their combinations can naturally be treated as the quantum numbers of the irreducible representations associated with the respective groups of symmetry . in this framework",
    "the low lying collective energy levels exhibit various kinds of smooth systematic dependence on the different quantum numbers , which can be evaluated empirically @xcite .    from another point of view",
    ", however , the current studies of various fine effects in the structure of collective interactions and the respective energy spectra suppose the presence of quite a complicated behavior of nuclear collective characteristics .",
    "thus , the application of the discrete approximation of a high order derivative of given nuclear characteristics as a function of particular physical quantity reveals various kinds of staggering effects which carry detailed information about the fine properties of nuclear interactions and the respective high order correlations in the collective dynamics of the system .",
    "typical examples are the @xmath7 staggering effects ( with @xmath8 being the angular momentum ) in the collective @xmath9- bands @xcite and nuclear octupole bands @xcite , the @xmath10 and @xmath11 , staggering in superdeformed nuclear bands @xcite and the @xmath12 staggering in the ground - state bands ( gsb ) of normally deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "another example is the odd - even staggering in nuclear binding energies @xcite or the behavior of the nuclear masses @xcite as a function of the atomic number @xmath13 , for which the influence of different pairing , @xmath14like quartetting and mean - field effects are considered to play a role .    in the above aspect",
    ", a natural question is whether the application of a high order discrete derivative analysis to the low lying collective states in wide range of nuclear chart would provide any staggering behavior of the respective energies as functions of the quantum numbers of an appropriate classification scheme .",
    "the answer of this question could open a new fine tool in the interpretation and the systematic study of nuclear collective interactions and their symmetries .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to examine the above problem with respect to the low lying collective states of even - even nuclei in the framework of an algebraic @xmath15 classification scheme @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption of this scheme is that the structure of nuclear proton and neutron valence shells can be characterized in a unique way by the quantum numbers of the irreducible representations ( irreps ) of the algebra @xmath16 and the ladder representations of the algebra @xmath17 which are subalgebras of  the boson representation of @xmath18 considered as a classification group . as a result",
    "the even - even nuclei of each major ( proton and neutron ) shell can be classified into sets of @xmath1-spin multiplets @xcite , where any nucleus is uniquely identified by the total number of valence bosons @xmath0 ( pairs of protons and neutrons ) and the third projection @xmath19 of the @xmath1-spin .",
    "it is known that in each @xmath1-spin multiplet the energies of the low lying yrast states exhibit a smooth and periodic behavior as functions of @xmath0 . on this basis ,",
    "a unified theoretical description of gsb energies in even - even nuclei has been obtained @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we apply the high order discrete derivative analysis to the both experimental and theoretical @xmath20 energies as functions of the quantum number @xmath0 in the framework of the respective @xmath1- multiplets appearing in the @xmath15 scheme .",
    "the same analysis is also applied to the next higher @xmath21 and @xmath22  levels of the yrast bands of the classified nuclei and some typical results are presented . as it will be seen the experimental data exhibit considerable @xmath5 staggering behavior in all considered @xmath1-multiplets ( with @xmath0 even or odd ) and also very well pronounced @xmath4 staggering effect in the cases when two neighboring @xmath23- multiplets are united into one single multiplet ( with both even and odd @xmath24 ) .",
    "in addition , we extend the study in some isotopic chains , where a tedious @xmath4 staggering effect can be observed also but its general magnitude is quite small compared to the patterns observed in the @xmath1-spin multiplets .",
    "we will see that these phenomena are reproduced theoretically by a generalized phenomenological energy expression derived in the framework of the classification scheme . on this basis",
    "we are able to provide an adequate physical interpretations of the observed staggering patterns in terms of the related collective model characteristics and the high order @xmath6-like quartetting and pairing nucleon interactions as well .    in sec .",
    "2 we briefly outline the algebraic base of the @xmath15 classification scheme . the high order discrete derivative formalism and its meaning in the context of the present theory is given in sec .",
    "3 . experimental and theoretical staggering patterns with @xmath5 in the @xmath1 - multiplets and with @xmath4 in the combined ( neighboring ) @xmath1 - multiplets and isotopic chains",
    "are presented in sec .",
    "4 . a detailed analysis of their form and amplitudes in the different multiplets",
    "is also given .",
    "in sec.5 the obtained results are analyzed in terms of the model characteristics of the classification scheme .",
    "some comments and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "the nuclear @xmath15 classification scheme is based on the use of two kinds of bosons , proton @xmath25  and neutron @xmath26 bosons , interpreted as pairs of the respective nucleons , confined in the valence orbits .",
    "the boson representation of the algebra @xmath2  is generated through the respective creation and annihilation operators as follows @xcite :    @xmath27    the following subset of the above operators ( [ spge ] ) : @xmath28 generates a @xmath29 algebra so that a @xmath30spin quantum number is assigned to the considered boson system with a mathematical structure similar to that of the isospin .",
    "the operator @xmath31  commutes with all the operators ( [ suf2 g ] ) acting in this way as a first order invariant of an @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the space @xmath35 in which the boson representation of @xmath2 acts is reducible and the operator @xmath36 splits it into two irreducible spaces @xmath37 and @xmath38 corresponding to @xmath0 even or odd respectively . acting on these spaces the operator of the total number of particles @xmath0 reduces them into a direct sum of a totally symmetric unitary irreps of @xmath39 labeled by @xmath40 for @xmath37 and @xmath41 @xmath42 for @xmath43 @xmath44 the operator @xmath19 ( [ suf2 g ] ) does not differ essentially from the first order casimir operator of the noncompact @xmath45 hence it reduces the spaces @xmath37 and @xmath43 to the ladder series defined by its fixed eigenvalues .",
    "the states from a given ladder , are defined by the eigenvalue of @xmath19 and are obtained by the subsequent action of the operator @xmath46 on the lowest weight state .",
    "the operator @xmath19 reduces each @xmath47 representation ( with fixed value of @xmath0 ) to the representations of @xmath48 labeled by @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( [ spge ] ) respectively . the same is obtained by reducing the @xmath17 ladders with the operator @xmath0 .    in terms of the well known and rather successful language of ibm-2 @xcite , the algebraic operators ( [ spge ] )",
    "obtain the physical meaning of basic nuclear characteristics inherent for the @xmath15 classification scheme .",
    "thus the eigenvalues of the operators @xmath51 and @xmath50 @xmath52 are naturally interpreted as the numbers of valence proton and neutron pairs for a nucleus of a given shell . here",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 are the proton and neutron numbers respectively of the double magic nucleus at the beginning of the shell , considered as the `` vacuum state '' for the symplectic representations .",
    "a basic point in the present classification scheme is that the major shells , which are defined by their bordering magic numbers @xmath55,@xmath56 ( with @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) are mapped on two @xmath59- multiplets @xmath55,@xmath60 , with @xmath0 being even @xmath61 or odd @xmath62 . in these terms",
    "the total number of valence bosons , @xmath0 , and the third projection of the @xmath1-spin , @xmath19 , are exactly the operators that reduce the @xmath2  spaces to a definite vector in one of the @xmath63 subspaces , corresponding to a given nucleus with fixed @xmath0 and @xmath19 . in this way the nuclei of given major shell are naturally classified into @xmath64 - multiplets ( with fixed @xmath19 and @xmath0 taking all its possible values @xcite ) , unified in each of the symplectic spaces @xmath65 and @xmath66 the nuclei belonging to each of these multiplets differ by @xmath5 , an @xmath6- like cluster ( two protons and two neutrons ) created by the operator @xmath67([spge ] ) . it is important to remark that another kind  of @xmath5 nuclear sequences @xcite can be defined in the symplectic spaces @xmath68  and @xmath69 by the action of the operators @xmath70  ( or @xmath71 )  on the minimal weight states of each @xmath72  - multiplet .",
    "these sequences correspond to the even - even nuclei from a given isotonic ( or isotopic chain),which differ by four protons ( or neutrons ) with @xmath19 differing by @xmath73 ( or @xmath74 ) .",
    "furthermore , if the anticommutation relations of the boson creation and annihilation operators @xmath75  and @xmath76 @xcite are formally introduced , one can easily see that @xmath2 is the even part of a superalgebra , which has the single boson operators as odd generators .",
    "these operators practically relate the even and odd symplectic multiplets . on this basis",
    "any two neighboring @xmath19- multiplets from @xmath37 and @xmath77 , can be united into one single odd ",
    "even @xmath19- multiplet in which the neighboring nuclei are determined by the subsequent alternative action of the operators @xmath78(@xmath79 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81  and thus differ alternatively by @xmath82 .",
    "in addition the nuclei belonging to such odd - even @xmath19- multiplets differ by @xmath4 . in the same way the isotonic and isotopic nuclear chains of even even nuclei with @xmath4 can be obtained by  the respective consecutive action of @xmath78(@xmath83  and @xmath84 ( @xmath85 without a change in the sign of @xmath86 .",
    "the above formalism has been applied for classifying the even - even nuclei into symplectic spaces mapped on the respective major nuclear shells @xcite .",
    "moreover , it provides a natural systematic of the yrast energy bands observed in these nuclei .",
    "it has been shown that the low - lying yrast energies exhibit a smooth and periodic behavior in each @xmath19 - multiplet , which allows their unified description in terms of the nuclear collective characteristics inherent for the @xmath15 classification scheme . on this basis",
    "the following generalized energy expression has been proposed @xcite : @xmath87 the second term of eq .",
    "( [ enom ] ) represents the generalized collective interaction characterized by the geometrical parameter @xmath88 the latter has the physical meaning of a measure for the interplay between the vibrational ( @xmath89  and the rotational ( @xmath90 collective modes ( [ enom ] ) and reflects the respective changes in nuclear shape . since in heavy nuclei the shape is changed from almost spherical at the beginning of given shell to axially deformed in the midshell region and back towards spherical at its closure , the parameter @xmath91 changes respectively from @xmath92 to @xmath93 and then again to @xmath94 .",
    "the values of @xmath91 have been determined @xcite for each of the classified nuclei by using the experimental yrast energy ratios @xmath95 which are known to provide a reliable criteria @xcite of nuclear collectivity .",
    "so , the assigned integer values of @xmath91  for each of the classified nuclei ( fixed values of @xmath0  and @xmath19 )  determine its type of collectivity .    the first term in eq .",
    "( [ enom ] ) , @xmath96 , is a dynamical ( inertial ) coefficient determined as a function of the six quantum numbers @xmath97 @xmath98 , which are specific for each nucleus in a given shell .",
    "generally , the variables @xmath99 depend on the number of protons @xmath100 and neutrons @xmath101 and the four magic numbers @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and can be expressed in terms of the classification quantum numbers @xmath0 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus for a fixed nuclear shell the inertial parameter is given by the expression : @xmath106 where @xmath107 are phenomenological parameters determined overall for all nuclear shells @xcite .",
    "in general , the geometrical parameter @xmath91 has its specific values for each of the classified nuclei .",
    "the inertial parameter @xmath96 is a function only of @xmath0 in each @xmath19 - multiplets , and of the two classification numbers in the combined odd - even and isotopic multiplets .",
    "as it became clear from sec . 2 ,",
    "the even - even nuclei of given @xmath19- multiplet appearing in the considered @xmath15 classification scheme are uniquely determined by the subsequent even ( or odd ) values of the valence boson number @xmath0 .",
    "this allows us to apply the high order discrete derivative analysis to the low  lying gsb energies @xmath108 for a given angular momentum @xmath109 in any considered @xmath19- multiplet , as a function of the quantum number @xmath0 , by analogy to the staggering analysis of rotational band energies applied in terms of the angular momentum @xmath8 @xcite .    since for any given @xmath19- multiplet",
    "the values of the quantum number @xmath0 of the neighboring members differ by @xmath5 ( @xmath110particle ) , the following quantity can be introduced : @xmath111 where @xmath112 the point function @xmath113 is proportional to the discrete approximation of the fourth derivative of the function @xmath114 , and obviously , to the fifth derivative of the energy @xmath108 : @xmath115 ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as such , it naturally obtains zero values for any polynomial form of @xmath108 of power less or equal to four .",
    "therefore , any non - zero values of the quantity @xmath113 will imply a higher order functional dependence .",
    "moreover , any staggering ( zigzagging ) behavior of the @xmath113- values will suggest the presence of quite complicated non - polynomial dependence of the lowest collective energy and the respective nuclear interactions on the quantum number @xmath0 .    on the above basis",
    "it is expected that the application of the quantity @xmath116 to the low - lying collective nuclear states within the @xmath19-multiplets of @xmath15 could provide a detailed information about the possible influence of @xmath6-particle - like high order quartetting interaction ( @xmath117 ) of nucleons on the systematic behavior of collective excitation energies .",
    "we should remark , that the application of the function @xmath113 for the energies of the nuclei in the isotopic and isotonic chains is restricted , since even in the larger shells there is not enough number of points ( observed excitation energies ) .",
    "actually this is due to the circumstance that the available data are separated in the two spaces @xmath37 and @xmath66the above  restriction is naturally released in the extended regions of exotic nuclei ( such as with @xmath118 and close to the drip lines ) , where the number of newly obtained experimental data grows continuously .",
    "now , we can extend the framework of the fine systematic analysis of low - lying collective energies by considering the unified odd - even @xmath19 - multiplets . within these multiplets",
    "the neighboring members differ by @xmath4 ( a proton or neutron pair ) in a way that the increasing @xmath0 corresponds to a _",
    "subsequent alternative _ adding of proton and neutron pairs to the valence shells . in this case",
    "the systematic behavior of the excitation energies can be characterized analogously to eq .",
    "( [ stag ] ) by a discrete approximation of the fourth derivative of the energy difference for @xmath4 : @xmath119 where @xmath120    the use of the same order in the discrete derivative approximations , ( [ stag ] ) and ( [ stag1 ] ) , for the @xmath19-multiplets with @xmath5 and the combined odd - even and isotopic multiplets with @xmath4 respectively , allows one to treat the @xmath121- particle quartetting and the different kinds of nucleon pairing correlations in nuclei on the same footing , as well as to compare quantitatively their fine systematic influence on nuclear collectivity .",
    "also , in this way the present classification scheme allows the standard analysis of the @xmath4 staggering effect in isotopic chains of even even nuclei . in the isotonic chains this analysis is limited due to the coulomb restriction on the possible proton numbers , but nevertheless it seems to be perspective in view of the current progress in the experimental investigations of proton rich nuclei .",
    "we have applied the functions @xmath113 ( [ stag ] ) and @xmath122 ( [ stag1 ] ) for the analysis of the experimental data @xcite on the lowest collective energies of even - even nuclei classified in the respective symplectic multiplets . in all the considered cases these functions are oscillating in respect to the zero of their scale , with a changing amplitude , i.e. exhibit staggering patterns , which will be analyzed bellow .    the function ( [ stag ] ) has been used in all possible cases , in which the @xmath19-multiplets of the considered @xmath15 classification scheme @xcite , contain more than 8 nuclei . for all of them",
    "we observe @xmath5 staggering behavior of the @xmath20 energy .",
    "some typical staggering patterns including either odd or even @xmath19-multiplets are shown on * fig",
    "we see , that for the different @xmath19-multiplets the general scale of the staggering amplitude depends essentially on the particular valence shells .",
    "thus , for the two multiplets @xmath123 * ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) * and @xmath124 * ( fig .",
    "1(c ) ) * , belonging to the essentially different ( light and heavy ) valence shell configurations @xmath125 and @xmath126 respectively , the staggering amplitude generally differs by more than one order in magnitude . while for the lighter shells @xmath127  the function @xmath113 oscillates between @xmath128 and @xmath129 mev * ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) * , for the heavier ( rare earth ) shells it drops in the interval @xmath130 $ ] mev * ( fig .",
    "1(c))*. some intermediate staggering magnitude in the interval @xmath131 $ ] mev is observed for the multiplet @xmath132 * ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , * which belongs to the  intermediate  valence space @xmath133 .    as a result",
    ", we find that the general @xmath5 staggering scale tends to be large for the light nuclear valence shells and essentially smaller , by more than one order in magnitude , for the heavy nuclear regions .",
    "however , we should remark that the more detailed comparison is restricted due to the fact that the  length  of the @xmath19- multiplets increases towards the heavier valence shells and , as it will be pointed out below , more complicated structure of the staggering patterns appears there .",
    "so , in the region of heavy nuclei we find that for any particular @xmath19 -multiplet the @xmath5 staggering function strongly varies in dependence on the quantum number @xmath0 . on * fig .",
    "1(c ) * we show three well developed ( long enough ) patterns obtained for the multiplets @xmath124 of the rare earth valence shells @xmath134 .",
    "we find that in the beginning of any multiplet @xmath135 as well as near its end @xmath136 a considerable staggering amplitudes of about @xmath137 mev are observed , while in the middle of the multiplet @xmath138 , which corresponds to the effective middle of the valence shells , the staggering effect is essentially suppressed to practically zero amplitude .",
    "also , we remark that in some cases ( see the multiplet @xmath139 on * fig .",
    "1(c)*)the transitions between the beginning , middle and the end of the multiplet are characterized by irregularities in the zigzagging curve with subsequent changes in the phase of the staggering pattern .",
    "this is a specific indication for some kind of phase transition in nuclear collectivity within the particular multiplet .",
    "further , in * fig .",
    "1(d ) * we illustrate the @xmath5 staggering patterns obtained for the experimental levels with angular momentum @xmath109 within the long @xmath140  multiplet .",
    "the different curves are characterized with the same phases of the oscillation , while the amplitude increases with the increasing of the angular momentum , conserving the same dependence on the quantum number @xmath0 .",
    "now , let us consider the fine structure of the odd  even @xmath141 multiplets obtained by uniting two neighboring @xmath19-multiplets from the spaces @xmath142  and @xmath69 .",
    "the respective @xmath20- energy sequences are obtained by switching between the subsequent members of the two considered multiplets .",
    "the unified odd - even @xmath141 multiplets contain much larger number of nuclei than the single multiplets , which allows one to extend the analysis by applying the discrete function  ( [ stag1 ] ) to all the nuclear shells , including the first @xmath143  and the last ( open ) @xmath144  major shells . in all of them we found that the experimental energies exhibit rather well pronounced @xmath4staggering patterns .",
    "some typical examples illustrating different combinations of odd - even multiplets from all the shells are shown in * fig .",
    "first of all , we see that the general scale of the @xmath4staggering is larger by almost one order of magnitude than the scale in the @xmath5  staggering patterns of the respective separate @xmath19-multiplets .",
    "( for example , compare * fig .",
    "2 ( c ) * and * fig .",
    "1(c ) * . )",
    "further , we find that the trend of the decrease of  the staggering amplitude with the increase of the shell dimension is observed with no exceptions in this case , like in the @xmath5  case .",
    "this can be seen , for the odd - even multiplets with @xmath145from the shell @xmath146  on * fig .",
    "2(a ) * and from the shell @xmath144  @xcite on * fig .",
    "2(d ) * , where the maximal staggering amplitude drops from @xmath147  in the first one , to @xmath148  in the last one .",
    "this decrease is gradual through the consecutive shells * ( fig .",
    "2(a ) -(d ) ) . *    as in the @xmath5  case",
    ", we observe that in the beginning and the end of any particular unified odd  even multiplets the staggering amplitude is larger , than in the middle of it .",
    "it is however important to remark that in the middle of the unified @xmath141multiplets in the ",
    "lightershells @xmath146 , @xmath149  and @xmath150 the decrease in the staggering magnitude is not very well expressed ,  as could be seen for the multiplets @xmath151 on * fig .",

    "the staggering amplitude is almost vanishing , as illustrated for the @xmath157  multiplet on * fig .",
    "* the application of  ( [ stag1 ] ) * *  * * to the energies of the next exited states @xmath158  in the combined odd - even multiplets , shows as in the @xmath3 staggering , that all the typical features of the energy behavior of the @xmath20-states , outlined above are even enhanced with the increase of the angular momentum .",
    "an example for one of the longest combined multiplets @xmath159 from the shell @xmath160 is given on * fig .",
    "*    the nuclear isotonic chains obtained in the scheme are too short , so * *  * * the @xmath122  function is investigated only in the isotopic chains of even- even nuclei , obtained by the consecutive action of the boson operators @xmath161 ( pairs of neutrons ) . it does not exhibit a pronounced staggering effect .",
    "an exception is presented on * fig .",
    "3 * , for the @xmath162 isotopes , but the  maximal amplitude in this case is two orders smaller @xmath163  than the odd - even @xmath4  staggering in the same shell**(fig .",

    "*    now , we turn to the analysis of above phenomena in terms of the collective model characteristics inherent for the applied @xmath15 classification of the theoretical energies ( [ enom ] ) are obtained as functions of coefficients @xmath96 and through them on the classification numbers @xmath0 , @xmath19 ( [ nip ] ) and the relevant value of @xmath91 for each nucleus .",
    "thus , the theoretical energies @xmath164 successfully reproduce the respective experimental data @xcite allowing us to apply our fine systematic analysis by situating them into the considered multiplets of the classification .",
    "hence , we apply the staggering filters ( [ stag ] ) and ( [ stag1 ] ) on the theoretically obtained by means of ( [ enom ] ) energies of the low lying collective states of even  even nuclei in all the multiplets , in which experimental @xmath5 and @xmath4 staggering was observed .",
    "we found that the behavior of the ( [ stag ] ) and ( [ stag1 ] ) is reproduced rather well by the theoretical energies .",

    "4(b ) * , respectively .",
    "we see that in both cases with @xmath5 and @xmath4  the specific systematic dependence of the staggering magnitude on the quantum number @xmath0 is reproduced .",
    "moreover in the ends of the multiplets the larger amplitudes are reproduced together with the correct signs .",
    "the theoretical amplitude is a bit smaller than the experimental one and its irregularity is more clear in the region of the well deformed nuclei . as illustrated on * fig .",

    "this means , that all the presented in this work analysis for the first  exited @xmath20 states is appropriate for all the higher yrast states , which were included in the fitting procedure , when ( [ enom ] ) was deduced in @xcite .",
    "the slight discrepancies in the theoretical reproduction of the staggering amplitudes are due to the accuracy of the phenomenological description and the restriction to integer values of @xmath88",

    "the typical model distribution of @xmath20 energy levels between the different @xmath91- modes of collective motion is illustrated on * fig .",
    "5 * for the long @xmath176 multiplet of the shell @xmath134 .",

    "we see that in the beginning of the multiplet ( @xmath180 ) the theoretical @xmath20 energies start from the high @xmath181  vibrational  curve , but with the increase of @xmath0 they rapidly dump down ( through @xmath182 ) to the  rotational iso - line  with @xmath93 which  receives  all levels in the middle region @xmath183 .",
    "further , in the end of the multiplet ( shell closure region @xmath184 ) several jumps up to the transitional ( @xmath185 ) collective modes are observed .",
    "namely , the above * *  * * rather large discrete jumps of energy as a function of @xmath0  between the different @xmath91- lines cause the pronounced @xmath5 staggering effect in the beginning and the end of the theoretically  filled  @xmath19-multiplet .",
    "the small ( but non zero ) staggering amplitudes appearing in the middle region can be considered as the effect of the five - point discrete derivative , ( [ eq : stagen ] ) , which has a  memory  of the preceding states and also  propagates  the information about  what happens  in the ends .",
    "[ fig:5 ]    at the same time , the change in the geometric factor @xmath169 trough its dependence on @xmath0 , reflects phenomenologically the respective change in the intrinsic nuclear structure and its influence on the character of collective motion .",
    "on this basis we can directly interpret the experimental @xmath5 staggering patterns as the result of rapid change in nuclear collective properties with respect to different intrinsically determined modes , related in this case to the accumulation of @xmath186like clusters .",
    "now , we can directly extend the above considerations with respect to the @xmath187 staggering patterns corresponding to changes in the intrinsic nuclear structure with alternating kinds of nucleon pairs . in the combined symplectic multiplets",
    "the analysis concerning the geometric factor @xmath91 and its contribution to the fine systematical behavior of @xmath20 energies is still valid for their members , but their more gradual change must be taken into account .",
    "it provides an analogous explanation of the large @xmath4 staggering amplitudes in the ends of given odd - even multiplet .",
    "however , in this case there is another factor that appears to be decisive especially for the essentially larger staggering scale compared to the @xmath5 case . in the single @xmath19 multiplet",
    "the difference between two neighboring energies is entirely determined by the quantum number @xmath0 and the geometric factor @xmath91 ( all other model quantities and parameters are fixed ) . in the combined multiplets",
    "there is additional dependence on the quantum number @xmath19 ( [ nip ] ) .",
    "the alternative change of the @xmath19- values with @xmath188 then @xmath189 in the two neighboring @xmath19- multiplets provides respective change in the inertial factors  @xmath96 ( [ nip ] ) and thus apriori produces a mutual energy oscillation in the respective energy sequences . * *  * * hence , even in the energy difference ( [ edn1 ] ) some staggering is obtained , due to its dependence on  the oscillating values of @xmath19 as seen on * *  * fig .",
    "6*. * *    the latter results in magnifying the @xmath4 staggering background .",
    "thus , our theoretical analysis suggest that the form and the sensitivity of @xmath187 staggering effect to the nuclear shell structure are determined by discrete changes of the quantum number @xmath91 in respect to @xmath0 , but its general magnitude is also determined by the fluctuations of the @xmath141values .",
    "the magnitude and the form of the staggering pattern , together with the respective set of phenomenological @xmath91-values provide both relevant qualitative and quantitative characteristics of nuclear collectivity in the framework or the @xmath15 classification scheme .",
    "the results presented so far allow us to outline the following systematic behavior of the experimentally observed low lying collective energy levels in the framework of the considered @xmath15 model scheme .",
    "the energies of the levels classified in any single @xmath19-multiplet of @xmath15 exhibit @xmath3 staggering behavior , while the levels of more general odd - even -multiplets provide respective @xmath4 staggering patterns of their fifth order discrete derivative . in both cases",
    "the general staggering magnitude is relatively large for the light nuclear valence shells and considerably smaller for the valence shells of heavy nuclei . in addition , both @xmath5 and @xmath4 staggering patterns of heavy nuclei are characterized by relatively large amplitudes in the ends and their suppression in the middle region of the respective single and combined odd - even @xmath19-multiplets . on the other hand , we find that the @xmath190 staggering effect is by an order of magnitude _ stronger _ and more _ regular _ in form than the @xmath5 staggering . for the odd - even @xmath191-multiplets the staggering is inherent even for the energy differences of the neighboring states ( [ edn1 ] ) , with @xmath19 integer and half integer .",
    "the weakest staggering effect is observed in the isotopic nuclear chains , where there is no oscillation of the @xmath86 values@xmath44    the application of the @xmath15 classification scheme provides relevant physical interpretation of the experimentally observed @xmath5 and @xmath187 staggering effects in terms of the nucleon correlations in nuclear valence shells .",
    "the @xmath5 effect indicates very fine systematic behavior of nuclear collectivity associated with the _ simultaneous _ adding of proton and neutron pairs ( @xmath6-like  clusters ) to valence shells , relevant to the effect of four nucleon interaction . in the @xmath4 staggering effect",
    "the situation is different . here",
    "the filling of valence shells is realized in two ways :    1 .   in the odd",
    "- even multiplets by the alternative adding of proton and neutron pairs ,  which is reflected by the alternative change of the @xmath141values and thus strongly magnifies the staggering effect , 2 .   in the isotopic multiplets by adding of only neutron pairs , which gives a very small staggering .    in these two cases",
    "the observed effect is due to the pairing correlations , which are of  lower order , but its magnitude strongly depends on the charge fluctuations in the consecutive adding of the nucleon pairs .",
    "this analysis provides an indication of the different ways of influence of the different orders of valence nucleon correlations ( pairing and quartetting ) on the fine systematic characteristics of the nuclear collectivity .",
    "the general formula for the yrast energies  @xmath164 obtained for the even - even nuclei , as classified in the symplectic multiplets reproduces rather accurately the experimental @xmath5 and @xmath187 staggering . .",
    "the geometric parameter @xmath91 , introduced in @xcite , not only unifies the description of the energies of the ground state bands of the spherical , transitional and well - deformed nuclei , but also is the main reason for obtaining the effects of the shape transitions reflected in both staggering effects .",
    "the amplitude of the staggering generally follows the same trend as @xmath91 , so it could be considered as relevant characteristic of the type of collectivity * *  * * of nuclear spectra and respectively the nuclear shape . * *  * * in the region of the well deformed nuclei , when @xmath91 @xmath192 the  staggering effect is strongly suppressed , which is observed in the rare -earth and actinide shells and is the reason for the larger scale in the light ones .",
    "the generalizations of the interaction coefficient  @xmath96 ( [ nip ] ) , as functions of the classification quantum numbers , case is important for the reproduction of the staggering effects . in the @xmath5 case @xmath19 is fixed , as well as in the isotopic multiplets with @xmath190 , while in the combined odd - even multiplets its values oscillate from a state to state .",
    "this reflects in the bigger values of the amplitudes and their regularity in the @xmath122 * *  * * function in the combined multiplets .",
    "the investigation in this work , reveals once again that the symplectic classification scheme is rather convenient for a generalization and reproduction of important physical properties of the even -even nuclei . it also has a predicting power , since in the consideration of the staggering @xmath187 effects in the last shell , we used experimental data @xcite , which was not included in the fitting procedure in @xcite . as the ladder series of the boson representations",
    "are infinite  dimensional , the symplectic multiplets can be extended with the newly obtained data for exotic nuclei and they can be considered as a new test for this kind of fine structure investigations .",
    "moreover the suggested quantitative analysis could provide a rather fine estimation of the possible energy regions , where low lying collective excitations of exotic nuclei can be expected .    in conclusion ,",
    "the above results show that the investigation of the different types of the staggering effects based on a convenient classification scheme is an useful tool to understand not only the collective properties of the lowest states of even  even nuclei , but also provides various quantitative considerations on the fine structure of the changes in nuclear collectivity .",
