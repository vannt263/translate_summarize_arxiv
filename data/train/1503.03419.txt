    "conventional phases and their transitions in condensed - matter systems can be understood by landau symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "however , new phases have emerged over the past few decades such as integer quantum hall  @xcite and fractional quantum hall  @xcite effects have evaded the usual landau - ginzburg - wilson paradigm .",
    "more recently , microscopic spin models exhibiting topological orders were also constructed , such as the toric code , quantum double models and string - nets  @xcite .",
    "these new quantum phases are called topological phases and they can not be characterized by a local order parameter . instead , they are found to possess the so - called topological order  @xcite characterized by properties such as the ground - state degeneracy , nontrivial quasiparticle statistics  @xcite , and more recently nonzero topological entanglement entropy  @xcite .",
    "recent progress on the general scheme of classifying these topological orders is also vitalized by using the notation of entanglement  @xcite . specifically , intrinsic topological orders have patterns of long - range entanglement that can not be achieved via local unitary transformation from a trivial product state .",
    "the local unitary transformations can only remove short - range entanglement , i.e. , quantum correlations between neighboring sites .",
    "due to its robustness against the local operations , the long - range entanglement gives rise to topological order of the nontrivial ground state .",
    "long - range entanglement is manifested in the so - called topological entanglement entropy  @xcite and other related entanglement quantities   @xcite .",
    "however , in general , it is still numerically challenging to access large system sizes to extrapolate accurately the topological entanglement to determine whether a topological phase exists . even if one manages to obtain nonzero topological entanglement entropy , there are possibly different topological phases that possess the same value of the entanglement .",
    "quasiparticle statistics , related to the generally non - abelian geometric phases , represented by the modular @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite matrices , provide a more refined characterization of a topological order . @xmath1 and @xmath2 are representations of @xmath4-rotation and the dehn twist , respectively , on a two - dimensional torus .",
    "these topological quantities do not depend on the microscopic details of the hamiltonian , and can be used as order parameters , albeit non - local .",
    "it turns out that one can , given a complete basis states in the degenerate ground space , exploit entanglement , with respect to a bipartite cut , to deduce the set of minimally entangled states ( mess ) .",
    "these states form a special complete set of bases  @xcite in the ground space , and from them the modular matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 can actually be deduced .",

    "the recent development of matrix product states ( mps )  @xcite and the 2d tensor product states ( tps )  @xcite , which are the generalization of the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method  @xcite has given rise to alternative approaches to obtain ground states and thus mess . these tensor - network or",
