    "the problem of fluctuation is particular striking approaching the critical temperature .",
    "the improved estimators in a cluster algorithm have much less variation and lead to more accurate results .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that the correlation function can be reliably determined with the single cluster algorithm of wolff @xcite by comparing our results with known exact results in @xmath0 and the results from series expansion in @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite . + the paper is organized in the following way . in section [ corr ]",

    "the connected pair correlation function @xmath16 for an ising model is defined as @xmath17 @xmath18 denote the sites of a d - dimensional simple cubic lattice of linear dimension @xmath19 with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath20 means the thermal average at temperature @xmath21 taken with an energy @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 projects on next neighbours of @xmath25 . + below the critical temperature a magnetization term has to be subtracted from @xmath26 in order to obtain a reasonable behaviour at large distances @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath16 can be considered as a @xmath28 matrix .",
    "usually its inverse ( the proper vertex function in field theory ) has a simpler behaviour .",
    "by means of translation invariance we can write @xmath29 @xmath30 is a @xmath31 dimensional vector whose components @xmath32 are restricted to the first billouin zone @xmath33 and have the form @xmath34 with integer @xmath35 .",
    "the positive function @xmath36 is simply the fourier transform of @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath38 it has the expansion @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the susceptibility in units of the curie susceptibility and @xmath41 the effective correlation length .",

    "the critical indices and the amplitudes @xmath47 and @xmath48 are known exactly @xcite , but the exact known @xmath49 refer to the true correlation length @xmath50 which is defined by the exponential decay of the correlation function @xmath51 for large separations and may differ especially for @xmath52 from @xmath53 .",
    "theoretical information on @xmath2 in @xmath0 and @xmath1 comes from series expansion @xcite and on the ratio @xmath54 in @xmath1 from renormalized perturbation theory @xcite . as discussed in the next section @xmath55",

    "in @xmath1 we will restrict our numerical analysis to the small @xmath30 region .",
    "in @xmath0 we can test in addition the following hypothesis stated by fisher et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "motivated by the results of the high temperature expansion they conjectured , that for all @xmath0 ising models @xmath55 is a function of the lattice generating function @xmath63 only which is given on a square lattice by @xmath64 since @xmath65 is a function of one variable only , @xmath66 and @xmath67 must satisfy the following relation @xmath68 provided @xmath69 is connected to @xmath60 by @xmath70 even if eq([rl ] ) would not be true , expansion of @xmath71 in powers of @xmath72 consists in a very accurate representation of @xmath16 . writing @xmath73 only @xmath74 with @xmath75 are present up to @xmath76 . converting eq.([exp ] ) in position space we get from eq.([fou ] ) @xmath77 where @xmath78 projects on points @xmath18 having euclidean distance @xmath79 .",
    "the high temperature expansion of ref @xcite for @xmath80 are given for convenience in appendix a. @xmath81 is of order @xmath82 and therefore very small .",

    "for @xmath86 the first two terms in eq.([gpos ] ) give a very accurate representation of @xmath87 , which may be useful in applications @xcite .",
    "a direct simulation of the disconnected correlation function @xmath88 is prohibitive both from storage requirement and computational effort , even the latter can be reduced by boolean operations ( since @xmath14 are two valued quantities ) and multi spin update @xcite . taking translation invariance within periodic boundary conditions into account",
    "only @xmath89 is needed , or @xmath90 having cured the storage problem the computational problem remains that eq.([g0y ] ) requires @xmath91algebraic operations per single spin update .",
    "for the observables discussed in section [ corr ] not the full fourier transform of @xmath10 is needed but rather @xmath92 or @xmath93 with @xmath94 @xmath95 the value at @xmath96 has to be determined by an extrapolation @xmath97 .",
    "the difference of this extrapolated value and the actual value of the r.h.s . of eq.([gfou ] ) gives @xmath98 .",
    "since @xmath60 in eq.([gfou ] ) can assume only @xmath19 different values the computational effort can be tolerated .",
    "however , eq.([gfou ] ) will still not lead to any meaningful result if one uses a conventional mc method with single spin update .",
    "the reason are the cancellations in the sum involved in eq.([gfou ] ) necessary to obtain a finite value for @xmath99 .",
    "the corresponding fluctuations in each single measurement prevent any convergence of the average value inside present computing facilities .",
    "these fluctuations can be avoided by using a cluster algorithm .",
    "its merit is not so much the reduced autocorrelation time between different configurations because this is balanced by the better vectorization of the local algorithms @xcite , but the existence of improved estimators for spin expectation values as ( [ gsim ] ) . for the single cluster method",
    "the estimator for the correlation function can be written as ( see appendix b ) @xmath100 \\ { } means an average over all single clusters @xmath47 and @xmath101 denotes the number of sites in @xmath47 . comparing eq.([gfou ] ) and eq.([gimp ] )",
    "we notice the absence of the spin factor @xmath14 which is due to the fact that all cluster spins have the same value .",
    "moreover the sum over @xmath15 extends only over the cluster instead of the whole lattice as in eq.([gfou ] ) . since the size of a cluster in the high temperature phase",
    "is governed by the correlation length @xmath53 , the phase factor will not vary substantialy for @xmath102 of @xmath103 which is precisely the region we are interested in an application of eq.([gimp ] ) . since the cancellations are only needed to render @xmath99 to be an decreasing function of @xmath60 they are no problem at all .",
    "note that this improvements hold only for cases where the magnetization is small .",
    "for @xmath52 and finite @xmath104 a fraction @xmath105 of the clusters will extend over the whole lattice and the same problems as in the single spin mc will reappear . therefore we can use our method in the ordered phase in a narrow region of @xmath106 only .",
    "+ for an error estimate one has to keep in mind that the autocorrelation time @xmath107 for a cluster algorithm even much smaller than for single spin update may not be small absolutely . therefore we divide the number of generated clusters into @xmath108 blocks of size @xmath109 . in each block the average of any observable is taken .",
    "the final mean value of the observable and its error are calculated from the different means of the blocks .",
    "this procedure will protect against autocorrelation times @xmath110 .",
    "typically we take a ratio @xmath111 .",
    "also functions of observables ( f.e.@xmath112 ) including their error may be easily estimated .",
    "in @xmath0 exact expressions for the behaviour of @xmath113 at small values of k are known . for a comparism we used the cluster algorithm on a @xmath114 lattice to simulate @xmath115 .",
    "typically we generated @xmath116 clusters in the high temperature phase and @xmath117 clusters in the ordered phase .",
    "the range of temperatures @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 was motivated because the correlation length must be small compared to the lattice size in order to avoid any finite size corrections . in fig .",
    "1 we show @xmath122 as function of @xmath123 for various temperatures @xmath124 . superimposed",
    "are straight line fits to points restricted to @xmath125 .",
    "for @xmath126 the data exhibit a linear behaviour in @xmath127 in the whole @xmath30 region .",
    "approaching @xmath128 deviations from this behaviour become important in agreement with the high temperature expansion .",
    "@xmath129 exhibits the same behaviour .",
    "since the statistical accuracy of @xmath67 is much better and the extrapolation of @xmath66 to @xmath130 is compatible with the one obtained from @xmath67 we discuss only the latter .",
    "the straight line fits yield us values for @xmath62 and @xmath131 according eq.([effective ] ) .",
    "these fits are represented by the lines in fig .",
    "1 . the resulting @xmath62 and @xmath53",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "2 on a double log scale as function of @xmath132 . the lines give the exact theoretical result @xcite , which agree well with the extrapolations of our data .",
    "the same analysis can be done for @xmath52 . due to the non vanishing magnetization less statistic is available and",
    "the quality is poorer as compared to @xmath124 .",
    "the deviation from a straight line behaviour sets in much earlier than for @xmath124 , as can be seen from the big difference of data and the corresponding lines fitted to the small @xmath30 region . from the fits we obtain @xmath62 and @xmath53 which are also shown in fig.2 .",
    "again we notice the agreement with the exact results @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath133 can be translated via eq.([conn ] ) in a value for the magnetization .",
    "the values for @xmath104 are divided by the theoretical value @xcite @xmath134 as one sees from fig .  2 ,",
    "this ratio is compatible with 1 inside the small errors . in this case",
    "straight line fits to m are not very meaningful , since eq.([magth ] ) predicts a substantical deviation from the power law ( [ indices ] ) in our range of @xmath132 values . to demonstrate the statistical accuracy we fit our values of @xmath62 and @xmath53 with the power laws ( [ indices ] ) . in fit",
    "a we fix the exponents to the theoretical values @xmath135 and @xmath136 , in fit c we fit in addition the exponents @xmath137 resp .",
    "@xmath138 simultaneously to the data for @xmath139 .",
    "the resulting parameters are displayed in table 1 together with the known exact values , resp .",
    "the values from the series expansion for the effective correlation length @xmath2 from ref @xcite . both agree within the statistics which shows that the cluster algorithm leads to reasonable values for the correlation function .",
    "+ in @xmath0 we can test apart from the behaviour near @xmath128 also the results of the high temperature expansion .",
    "if the coefficients @xmath74 for @xmath140 in the expansion of @xmath141 can be neglected , @xmath142 and @xmath143 can be determined from @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the experimental value of coefficients @xmath142 and @xmath143 are obtained by eq.([a(t ) ] ) .",
    "these values divided by the series expansions ( [ app ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "4 as function of @xmath144 for various values of the lattice size @xmath19 . below @xmath145",
    "the first two coefficients in the expansion ( [ gpos ] ) computed by the high temperature series give a good description of the correlation function which can be used in practical applications @xcite .",
    "the deviations above @xmath146 are not due to finite size effects .",
    "they signal not so much a breakdown of the series expansion for @xmath147 but rather the appearance of higher coefficients @xmath148 which spoil the relations ( [ a(t ) ] ) between @xmath149 and @xmath147 .",
    "this is corroborated by the values of @xmath150 obtained by eq.([a(t ) ] ) which are zero below @xmath145 and quickly exceed the value expected from eq.([app ] ) by an order of magnitude .",
    "whereas finite size corrections are negligiable for leading effects discussed up to now , a test of the fisher hypothesis @xmath55 being a function of the lattice generating function only is very sensitive on small finite size corrections .",
    "this is because any deviation from the relation ( [ a(t ) ] ) can be a small effect only and the cancellations necessary to suppress the low order @xmath144 terms in @xmath74 are no longer effective at order @xmath151 .",
    "we can control these corrections by the number of clusters with loop number @xcite non zero ( clusters wrapping around the lattice at least once ) . requiring the fraction of those clusters to be less than @xmath152 we have to choose on a @xmath153 lattice an inverse temperature not larger than @xmath154 . in order to make a small effect visible",
    ", we divide both @xmath155 and @xmath156 by a common linear factor r @xmath157 obtained by a fit to @xmath112 . in fig .",
    "5 @xmath158 and @xmath159 are shown as function of @xmath160 .",
    "if @xmath149 would be linear in @xmath160 , both data points would fall on a constant line at 1 .",
    "the deviation from 1 signalizes the appearance of higher coefficients @xmath74 with @xmath161 as expected from the series expansion .",
    "if the hypothesis ( [ a(t ) ] ) is true , both sets of data points have to agree , which is obviously not the case inside our errors .",
    "since at the level of accuracy of @xmath162 finite size corrections can be neglected , our data are in disagreement with fishers conjecture .",
    "+ for @xmath1 we restrict ourselves to the behaviour near @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "the computational effort increases rapidly with @xmath19 , especially in the ordered phase at @xmath164 . the data for a @xmath165 lattice shown in fig .",
    "6 needed @xmath166h on a cray ymp .",
    "since the correlation lengths are smaller in @xmath1 , we can cover the same range of @xmath132 as in @xmath0 .",
    "as before the function @xmath167 has smaller errors than @xmath66 .",
    "we do not show a plot of @xmath67 , since its behaviour is very similar to the @xmath0 case . performing linear fits in the small @xmath30 region",
    "we obtain @xmath168,@xmath169 and @xmath170 shown in fig . 6 on a double log scale . from the linear behaviour",
    "we see that the power laws predicted by eq.([indices ] ) are well satisfied . to obtain values for exponents and amplitudes we performed the following fits with or without correction to scaling : @xmath171 in principle the correction terms should be parametrized by nonlinear power laws , but within our statistics a determination of an exponent in the nonleading term is not possible .",
    "we checked that replacing @xmath172 by @xmath173 in the correction does not change the values of exponents or amplitudes . in fit",
    "a we fix the exponents to the generally accepted values @xcite and leave out the corrections which are allowed in fit b. the fits c and d are similar to a and b except that also the exponents @xmath137,@xmath138 and @xmath174 are free parameters .",
    "the resulting values and the corresponding @xmath175 are given in table ii .",
    "in the fits to @xmath62 and @xmath104 correction terms are definiteley needed , whereas for @xmath53 inclusion of the latter does not improve @xmath176 . in the case of the susceptibility variation of @xmath137 does not reduce @xmath175 . therefore we believe that fit b is the most reliable one and is also shown in fig .",
    "the values for the amplitudes are in agreement with the series expansion ( last column in table ii ) .",
    "variation of the exponent @xmath138 for the correlation length leads to a value very close to the accepted value of @xmath138 .",
    "since including corrections in fit b did neither change the values of @xmath2 nor improve @xmath175 fit d should not be trusted so much . in this case",
    "we adopt fit c as the most reliable one . a common feature of fit a , b and c is a consistent @xmath177 deviation in @xmath178 from the series expansion . the universal ratio ( from fit c )",
    "@xmath54 @xmath179 disagrees with ref @xcite , but is in agreement with a recent calculation using renormalized perturbation expansion in @xmath1 @xcite and with experimental data @xcite . in the case of @xmath104 fit d",
    "is definitely preferred due to the acchieved @xmath175 . both exponent @xmath174 and the amplitude @xmath48",
    "are somewhat smaller as compared to the series expansion but are consistent within the errors . in table",
    "ii our final values for the amplitudes are underlined . with the exception of @xmath178 the cluster monte carlo method yielded values compatible with the series expansion with similar accuaracy .",
    "due to fluctuations the correlation function @xmath10 in ising models for @xmath12 can not be determined with local monte carlo methods except for rather modest lattice sizes .",
    "since the improved estimators in a cluster algorithm exhibit much less fluctuation the fourier transform of @xmath10 can be measured .",
    "we used the known results in @xmath0 to demonstrate the validity of our method . as a byproduct",
    "we show that a hypothesis of fisher may not be true . in @xmath1",
