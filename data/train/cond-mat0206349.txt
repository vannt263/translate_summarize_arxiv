    "in order to establish a sound understanding for any scientific phenomenon , one has from numerical data to obtain laws which can be next derived theoretically .",
    "some difficulty arises in particular in nonlinear dynamical systems because of the problem to sort out noise from both chaos and deterministic components [ bhattacharya and kanjilal , 2000 ; provenzale et al . ,",
    "moreover , algorithms for solving the inverse problem for nonlinear systems with underlying unknown dynamical processes are notoriously hardly reliable [ theiler , 1992 ] .",
    "in fact , to extract dynamical equations for chaotic - like data is an enormous challenge [ rowlands , 1992 ] . practically one is often led to empirical relationships .",
    "this is the case of the meteorology field where there is a widely mixed set of various ( sometimes ) unknown influences , over different time and space scales .",
    "works of interest for sorting out deterministic ingredients in chaotic systems , as in [ hilborn , 1994 ; ott , 1993 ; schreiber , 1999 ; celluci , 1997 ; davis et al . ,",
    "1996a ] , can be mentioned for general purpose though this is not an exhaustive list of references .",
    "it is known that two equivalent @xmath3 @xmath4 govern the dynamics of a system , i.e. the fokker - planck equation and the langevin equation , the former for the probability distribution function of time and space signal increments , the latter for the increment themselves [ reichl , 1980 ; ernst et al . , 1969 ; risken , 1984 ; hggi and thomas , 1982 ; gardiner , 1983 ] .",
    "they are both condensates of the huge set of ( 6n ) hamilton equations which should in practice describe the whole dynamics of the system of n particles by giving the time evolution of both coordinates and momenta of each individual particle .",
    "this is a highly unrealistic scheme of work , and therefore conservation laws are used in order to derive the navier - stokes equations , from the averaging of basic quantities weighted by the above probability functions [ reichl , 1980 ; huang , 1967 ] .",
    "such a `` micro - turned - macro - scopic description '' can be by passed when describing the _ evolution of the quasi - equilibrium probability distribution function _ of such particles , i.e. in writing a boltzmann equation [ huang , 1967 ] .",
    "however this corresponds to a mean field description of the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) [ reichl , 1980 ; ernst et al .",
    ", 1969 ; risken , 1984 ; hggi and thomas , 1982 ; gardiner , 1983 ] , an approximation which might be too rough for this sort of nonlinear system dynamics .",
    "recently much advance has been made in describing nonlinear phenomena in meteorology , after the canonical lorenz approximation [ lorenz , 1963 ; schuster , 1984 ] of the navier - stokes equations for sorting out some deterministic and stochastic components of turbulent fluid motion in the atmosphere .",
    "in fact , turbulence [ frisch , 1995 ; parisi and frisch , 1985 ; hunt , 1999 ] seems now to be part of more general class of problems similar to those found when there are long range fluctuations , as in financial data [ ghashghaie et al .",
    ", 1996 ; mantegna and stanley , 1995 ] , traffic [ chowdhury et al . ,",
    "2000 ] , dielectric breakdown [ vandewalle et al . , 1999 ] , heart beats [ ivanov et al . ,",
    "1999 ] , etc ... such observations corroborate the idea that scaling [ stanley , 1971 ] and fractal geometry [ schuster , 1984 ] principles could be useful in such studies on atmospheric turbulence [ marshak et al . , 1997 ] . thus to derive the fpe [ risken , 1984 ; hggi and thomas , 1982 ; gardiner , 1983 ] for some meteorological effect is of primary interest .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive such an fpe , in a first principle statistical approach , from given raw data , i.e. for the liquid water path ( lwp ) fluctuations in clouds , - in terms of a drift @xmath5 and a diffusion @xmath6 coefficient .",
    "much following the lines of thought of [ friedrich et al . ,",
    "2000 ] it will be shown that the fpe ( also known as the kolmogorov equation ) can be derived up to the _ first two _ moments of the ( _ measured _ ) conditional probability distribution functions @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a signal increment and @xmath9 a time delay .",
    "thus the method is not anymore based on the conventional phenomenological comparison between models and several stochastic aspects , but is a @xmath10 @xmath11 ( or first principle , _ from a statistical point of view _ ) approach .",
    "this allows us to examine long and short time scales on the _ same footing _ , and suggests new features to be implemented in related weather forecasting .",
    "indeed _ it is here below verified _ that the solution of the fpe yields the probability distributions with high accuracy , including the long and high tail @xmath8 and @xmath9 events . in some sense",
    "the agreement proves that searching for more improvement with including further event of similar cases is not necessary .",
    "furthermore the so found analytical form of both drift @xmath5 and diffusion @xmath6 coefficients has a simple physical interpretation .",
    "it is also shown that a truncation of the fpe expansion in terms of high order joint probabilities to the first two terms is quite sufficient .",
    "moreover the identification of the underlying process leading to the heavy tailed probability density functions ( pdf ) for the lwp fluctuation correlation with @xmath9 and the volatility clustering ( as seen in fig .",
    "3 below ) seems to be a new observation leading to an interestingly new set of puzzles for this sort of clouds [ cahalan et al . ,",
    "1995 ] , and more generally in atmospheric science .",
    "the changes in a time series for a signal @xmath12 are commonly measured by the quantity @xmath13 , or increments @xmath8 = @xmath14 . results of the analysis of a data set @xmath15 , selecting among others lwp observations , are presented here .",
    "the 25 772 data points are taken from microwave radiometer measurements at the southern great plains site of atmospheric radiation measurement ( arm ) ] of department of energy during the period january 9 - 14 , 1998 as used by [ ivanova et al . ,",
    "the microwave radiometer measures the brightness temperature at two frequency channels , one at 23.8  ghz and the other at 31.4  ghz .",
    "then both brightness temperature data series are used to retrieve the vertical columnar amount of water vapor and vertical columnar amount of liquid water in the cloud , i.e. the so - called liquid water path .",
    "the raw data @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is equivalent to a time index ) of the liquid water path in stratus clouds is shown in fig . 1",
    ".    the first thing is to consider whether the distribution function of increments has short or long tails , and whether there is some scaling law involved .",
    "next the central issue is the understanding of the statistics of fluctuations which determine the evolution of the cloud .",
    "there are different estimators for the short and/or long range dependence of fluctuations correlations [ taqqu et al . ,",
    "1995 ] . through a detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa )",
    "method [ ausloos and ivanova , 1999 ] we show first that the _ long range correlations _ are not brownian .",
    "the method has been used previously in the meteorological field [ ivanova et al . , 2000 ; ausloos and ivanova , 1999 ; koscielny - bunde et al . , 1998",
    "; ivanova and ausloos , 1999 ] and its concepts are not repeated here .",
    "we show on fig .",
    "2a the final result , for the    @xmath18}^2 } } \\sim \\tau^{\\alpha}\\ ] ]    indicating a scaling law characterized by an exponent @xmath19 , markedly different from @xmath20 , thus indicating antipersistence of the signal from about 3 to about 150  minutes . next the power spectrum @xmath21 with spectral exponent * @xmath22 * is also shown ( see fig .",
    "2b ) [ davis et al . , 1996b ] .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test on surrogate data has indicated the statistical validity of the value and error bars .",
    "thereafter we focus on the lwp changes measured as increments @xmath8 which are given in fig . 3",
    "in units of the standard deviation @xmath23 of @xmath8 at @xmath24  s. ln order to characterize the statistics of these lwp changes , lwp increments @xmath25 , @xmath26 for delay times @xmath27 , @xmath28 at the same time @xmath29 are considered .",
    "the corresponding joint probability density functions are evaluated for various time delays @xmath27 @xmath30 @xmath28 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath30 ... directly from the given data set .",
    "one example of a contour plot of these functions is exhibited in fig .",
    "4 . if two lwp changes , i.e. @xmath25 and @xmath26 are statistically independent , the joint pdf should factorize into a product of two probability density functions :    @xmath32    leading to a camelback or an isotropic single hill landscape .",
    "the tilted anisotropic form of the joint probability density ( fig .",
    "4 ) clearly shows that such a factorization does not hold for small values of @xmath33log(@xmath34)@xmath33 , whence both lwp changes are _ statistically dependent_. the same is found to be true for other ( @xmath35 ) ratios .",
    "this is in agreement with the hint taken from the above observations for the long range cross - correlation functions with the dfa .",
    "this implies a ( fractal - like ) hierarchy of @xmath1 scales .",
    "if fluctuations in lwp went up over a certain @xmath36 , then it is more likely that , on a shorter @xmath27 within the larger one , the lwp went down instead of up . to analyze these correlations in more detail , the question on what kind of statistical process underlies the lwp changes over a @xmath37 of nested time delays @xmath38 of decreasing duration should be raised .",
    "a complete characterization of the statistical properties of the data set in general requires the evaluation of joint pdf s @xmath39(@xmath25,@xmath27; ... ;@xmath40,@xmath41 ) depending on n variables ( for arbitrarily large n ) . in the case of a markov process ( a process without memory ) [ schuster , 1984 ] ,",
    "an important simplification arises : the n - point pdf @xmath39 is generated by a product of the conditional probabilities @xmath42(@xmath43,@xmath44,@xmath45 ) = @xmath42(@xmath43,@xmath46;@xmath47,@xmath48)/ @xmath42(@xmath47,@xmath45 ) for i = 1, ... ,n-1 .",
    "the conditional probability is given by the probability of finding @xmath49 values for fixed @xmath47 .",
    "as a necessary condition , the chapman - kolmogorov equation    @xmath50    should hold for any value of @xmath51 , with @xmath27 @xmath30 @xmath51 @xmath30 @xmath36 .",
    "we checked the validity of the chapman - kolmogorov equation for different @xmath45 triplets by comparing the directly evaluated conditional probability distributions @xmath42(@xmath52 ) with the ones calculated ( @xmath53 ) according to eq.(3 ) , in fig.5 .",
    "the solutions of eq .",
    "( 4 ) usually give rise to exponential laws , but initial conditions must be taken into account for adjusting the constants of the integration . starting with a stretched exponential ,",
    "the latter is conserved after successive integrations , with a width varying with @xmath9 .",
    "the power law probability density function _ which is observed _ is thus a signature of fractal properties of the signal increments because the tails of the pdf are not truly exponential ones . in fig .",
    "5a , the contour lines of the two corresponding pdf s for all values of @xmath25 are shown .",
    "there are mild deviations , probably resulting from a finite resolution of the statistics .",
    "cuts for some exemplarily chosen values of @xmath25 are shown in addition in fig . 5 ( b - d ) .",
    "as is well known , the chapman - kolmogorov equation yields an evolution equation for the change of the distribution functions @xmath42(@xmath54 ) and @xmath42(@xmath8,@xmath9 ) across the scales @xmath9 [ reichl , 1980 ; ernst et al .",
    ", 1969 ; risken , 1984 ; hggi and thomas , 1982 ; gardiner , 1983 ]",
    ". for the following it is convenient ( and without loss of generality ) to consider a normalized logarithmic time scale @xmath55= @xmath56 ( 640/@xmath9 ) .",
    "the limiting case @xmath45 @xmath57 0 corresponds to @xmath55 @xmath57 @xmath58 .",
    "the chapman - kolmogorov equation formulated in differential form yields a master equation , which can take the form of a fokker - planck equation ( for a detailed discussion , we refer the reader to [ reichl , 1980 ; ernst et al . , 1969",
    "; risken , 1984 ; hggi and thomas , 1982 ; gardiner , 1983 ] ) to @xmath55 is non linear and might be debatable if the following equations ( 4 ) and ( 9 ) are integrated with respect to time .",
    "this is not done here .",
    "the integrations discussed in the text are made at fixed @xmath9 or @xmath55 . ] :    @xmath59 p ( \\delta x , \\tau)\\ ] ]    in terms of a drift @xmath5(@xmath8,@xmath55 ) and a diffusion coefficient @xmath6(@xmath8,@xmath55 ) .",
    "note that the fokker - p1anck equation results from a truncation of the master equation expanded in terms of high order joint probabilities . according to pawula s theorem [ risken , 1984 ] ,",
    "such a truncation is valid provided that the fourth order coefficient @xmath60 vanishes .",
    "we did check the @xmath60 coefficient for @xmath61 $ ] and obtained values that are two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath6 and three decades smaller than @xmath5 , which we consider justifies the truncation .",
    "the functional dependence of the drift and diffusion coefficients can be estimated directly from the moments @xmath62 of the conditional probability distributions ( cf .",
    "5 ) :    @xmath63    for different small @xmath64 s ( fig .",
    "6 ) , such that    @xmath65    for @xmath66 .    the coefficient @xmath5 shows a linear dependence on @xmath8 , while @xmath6 can be approximated by a polynomial of degree two in @xmath8 .",
    "this behavior was found for all scales @xmath55 and @xmath64 .",
    "therefore the drift term @xmath5 is well approximated by a linear function of @xmath8 , whereas the diffusion term @xmath6 follows a function quadratic in @xmath8 . for large values of @xmath8",
    "the statistics becomes poorer and the uncertainty increases . from a careful analysis of the data based on the functional dependences of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "6 a - b ) , the following approximations hold true :    @xmath67    @xmath68    it may be worthwhile to remark that the observed quadratic dependence of the diffusion term @xmath6 is essential for the logarithmic scaling of the intermittency parameter in previous studies on turbulence . finally , the fpe for the distribution function is known to be equivalent to a langevin equation for the variable , i.e. @xmath8 here , ( within the ito interpretation [ reichl , 1980 ; ernst et al . , 1969 ; risken , 1984 ; hggi and thomas , 1982 ; gardiner , 1983 ] )    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is a fluctuating @xmath71-correlated force with gaussian statistics , i.e. @xmath30 @xmath70 @xmath72@xmath73 = 2@xmath74 .",
    "at least since the pioneering work of lorenz [ lorenz , 1963 ] stochastic problems in turbulence are commonly treated as processes running in time @xmath29 with long time correlations .",
    "inspired by the idea of an existing energy cascade process [ cahalan , 1994 ] we present here a new approach , namely , we investigate among other related phenomena , how lwp changes are correlated on different time steps @xmath9 .",
    "the pdf shape expresses an unexpected high probability ( compared to a gaussian pdf ) of large lwp changes which is of utmost importance for forecasting . in recent works [ friedrich et al . , 2000 ;",
    "friedrich and peinke , 1997 ] this finding leads to postulating the existence of hierarchical features , i.e. an energy cascade process from large to small time scales .",
    "the existence of finite non gausssian tails for large events is thought to be due or to imply drastic evolutions , as for earthquakes , financial crashes or heart attacks .",
    "one unexpected result is the time dependence of the tails ( fig.3 ) which seems quite smooth for the lwp case .",
    "this puzzle should initiate new research with a goal toward forecasting , in particular to find cases in which such a smoothness does not hold .",
    "this evolution shows _ how the pdf s deviate more and more from a gaussian shape _ as @xmath9 increases or @xmath55 decreases .",
    "this definitely is a new quality in describing the hierarchical structure of such data sets , - not seen in the dfa nor spectral result .",
    "now it becomes clear that one must not require stationary probability distributions for lwp differences for different @xmath55 ; on the contrary the coupling between different scales @xmath55 via a markov process is essential .",
    "thus also a proper modeling of the time evolution of lwp differences for a fixed time delay must take into account the coupling of these quantities to lwp differences on different time delays .",
    "furthermore , it is stressed that in contrast to the use of phenomenological fitting functions , the above method provides the evolution process of pdf s _ from small time delays to larger ones_. interestingly this is through an analogy with two physically meaningful coefficients , a drift term @xmath5 and a diffusion term @xmath6 .",
    "the first one linearly behaves , thus looks like a `` restoring force '' , the second behaving quadratically in @xmath8 , is obviously like an autocorrelation function as for _ bona fide _",
    "( chemical ) diffusion .",
    "of course further theoretical work is needed before understanding the numerical values in eqs .",
    "( 7)-(8 ) .",
    "finally , the present report presents a method on how to derive an underlying mathematical ( _ statistical or model free _ ) equation for a lwp cascade directly .",
    "the method yields an effective stochastic equation in the form of a fpe in the variable @xmath9 .",
    "the excellent agreement between the experimental and the statistical approach removes the need for much further proof based on examining many other cases for the same type of clouds .",
    "the fpe provides the complete knowledge as to how the statistics of lwp distribution change correlations on different delay times .",
    "since this includes an autocorrelation analysis in time @xmath29 for a scalar @xmath8 , it is suggesting that the findings could be implemented in atmospheric weather low dimensional @xmath75 [ grabowski and smolarkiewicz , 1999 ; ragwitz and kantz , 2000 ] .",
    "consequently , even though for the first time in atmospheric science , a stochastic equation ( of lwp evolution ) is hereby introduced from first principles , several interesting statements can be presented and new questions opened .",
