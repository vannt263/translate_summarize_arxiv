    "gravitational waves represent one of the great challenges of fundamental physics and will open a new window in the astronomy ( e.g. misner et al . 1973 , centrella 2003 , mio 2006a , 2006b ) .",
    "no one has ever detected directly the ripples in a curved space - time generated by accelerated masses .",
    "a ( quasi-)periodic source is the most promising candidate for the first detection . hence , ( quasi-)periodic sources have been studied for the last few decades in numerous articles , where they assume a single star in rotation / oscillation ( e.g. kokkotas and schmidt 1999 , stergioulas 2003 ) or double stars in binary motion ( e.g. asada and futamase 1997 , blanchet 2006 ) . in particular , event rates of an inspiraling and finally merging compact binary ( curran et al .",

    "2003 ) are discussed by taking account of large - scale detectors such as ligo , virgo , geo600 , tama300 and lisa ( centrella 2003 , mio 2006a , 2006b ) .",
    "furthermore , gravitational waves generated by a binary system have been intensively studied by perturbations such as the post - newtonian approximation ( e.g. asada and futamase 1997 , blanchet 2006 , faye et al .",
    "2004 , berti et al .",
    "2006 ) , or by full numerical simulations for neutron stars ( shibata 1999 ) and for black holes ( pretorius 2005 , campanelli et al .",
    "2006b , baker et al .",
    "2006 , diener et al .",
    "however , much less attention has been paid to n - body gravitating systems because of their chaotic orbits when @xmath1 .",
    "there are existing works which are limited in the sense that they study a binary system affected by the existence of a third body , namely perturbations induced by the third object ( ioka et al .",
    "1998 , wardell 2002 , campanelli et al .",
    "2006a ) . here",
    ", one may ask whether or not n - body systems can generate ( quasi-)periodic gravitational waves .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to answer this question .",
    "the main results of this paper are two ; ( 1 ) for the first time as far as we know , we show that some of triple stars are capable of generating periodic waves if a certain condition is satisfied . this illustration would imply that a class of n - body gravitating systems may be relevant to the gravitational waves generation . ( 2 ) we show also that a solution employed as a specific model does not radiate the angular momentum .",
    "a well - known example in which no angular momentum is radiated away is two non - spinning black holes in a head - on collision ( smarr 1979 , price and pullin 1994 ) , where this system is axisymmetric and thus has a rotational killing vector .",
    "therefore , we can easily understand no angular momentum loss . on the other hand ,",
    "the specific system employed in this paper has no killing vector as seen below .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in this paper , we restrict ourselves within 3-body systems for convenience . in section 2 , we assume the newtonian gravity for motion of a 3-body system . in section 3 , the waveform and the loss rate of the energy and the angular momentum are estimated by using the so - called quadrupole formula for simplicity .",
    "finally , we discuss the the time scale for radiation reaction in order to estimate merging event rates .",
    "it is impossible to describe all the solutions to the 3-body problem even for the @xmath2 potential .",
    "the simplest periodic solutions for this problem was discovered by euler ( 1765 ) and by lagrange ( 1772 ) . the euler s solution is a collinear solution , in which the masses are collinear at every instant with the same ratios of their distances .",
    "the lagrange s one is an equilateral triangle solution in which each mass moves in an ellipse in such a way that the triangle formed by the three bodies revolves . built out of keplerian ellipses , they are the only explicit solutions . in these solutions , each mass moves on an ellipse ( a circle for the equal mass case ) .",
    "therefore , the associated gravitational waveform is a superposition of a waveform for each mass orbiting in an ellipse .",
    "an interesting solution that three bodies move periodically in a figure - eight was found firstly by moore by numerical computations ( moore 1993 ) .",
    "the existence of such a figure - eight orbit was proven by mathematicians chenciner and montgomery ( chenciner and montgomery 2000 ) .",
    "this solution is shown to be stable in the newtonian gravity ( simo 2002 , galan et al .",
    "the figure - eight seems unique up to scaling and rotation according to all numerical investigations , and at the end its unicity has been recently proven ( montgomery 2005 ) .",
    "many efforts have been paid to reveal some properties such as the convexity in the figure - eight solution ( kapela and zgliczynski 2003 , fujiwara and montgomery 2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is shown numerically that fourth , sixth or eighth order polynomial can not express the figure - eight solution ( simo 2002 ) .",
    "nevertheless , no analytic expressions in closed forms for the figure - eight trajectory have been found up to now .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of investigating gravitational waves , we numerically prepare the figure - eight orbit .    for simplicity",
    ", we assume a 3-body system with each mass equal to @xmath3 .",
    "without loss of the generality , the orbital plane is taken as the @xmath4 plane .",
    "the position of each mass is denoted by @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath34 , respectively .",
    "this plot is in contrast to that of an equal - mass binary , for which gravitational waves are expressed as a simple sine curve with one maximum and one minimum . on the other hand",
    ", there is a small valley between the nearest maxima and a small ridge between the nearest minima in figure 3 . at the bottom of the valley and the top of the ridge , one of the three masses",
    "passes the knot of the figure - eight , corresponding to figs . 1 and 2 , respectively . ,",
    "width=302 ]    the loss rate of the energy @xmath35 and the angular momentum @xmath36 is given by the quadrupole formula ( misner et al .",
    "1973 , blanchet 2006 ) .",
    "because of @xmath37 for each mass , @xmath38 and @xmath39 vanish . in a case of the figure - eight solution , we can show numerically that @xmath40 vanishes .",
    "one may ask why the emitted waves carry away no total angular momentum , though each body is likely to lose its orbital angular momentum by gravitational waves .",
    "this apparent paradox happens because the total angular momentum of this 3-body system vanishes , while the angular momentum of each body does not necessarily , as seen from fig .",
    "1 . as a result ,",
    "gravitational waves carry away the angular momentum of each body , while it is impossible for this system to lose the total angular momentum as the sum .",
    "for instance in fig . 1 , at the initial time , the particle labeled by 3 has no orbital angular momentum .",
    "the particle 1 has the orbital angular momentum , which is carried away by gravitational waves .",
    "it is true of the particle 2 but in the opposite sign . therefore , these changes in the orbital angular momentum cancel each other .",
    "this cancellation is expressed as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes the angular momentum of each body .",
    "no angular momentum radiation as a consequence of such a cancellation is in contrast to the case of the head - on collision of two non - spinning black holes ( smarr 1979 , price and pullin 1994 ) . in the head - on collision case , each black hole moves without any orbital angular momentum with respect to the common centre of mass .",
    "in fact , the angular momentum of each black hole is not carried away ( @xmath43 for each black hole ) .",
    "clearly no total angular momentum is carried away .",
    "the energy loss rate is estimated as @xmath44 as a result , the radiation reaction time scale is evaluated as @xmath45 which gives a rough estimate of the collision time .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the dependence of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 on @xmath3 and @xmath49 is the same as that on the mass and separation of a binary , as implied also by a dimensional analysis .",
    "let us consider a ` compact ' system of three black holes just before merging .",
    "to do so , we take @xmath49 as a much shorter distance , say a dozen of the schwarzschild radius of each mass . then , the orbital period of this system is of the order of a few milli - seconds .",
    "the frequency of the associated gravitational waves becomes a few khz , around which the large - scale interferometric detectors ( ligo , virgo , geo600 , tama300 ) is most sensitive .",
    "we obtain the amplitude of the gravitational waves as @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the schwarzschild radius .",
    "clearly we have to take account of relativistic corrections such as the back - reaction on the evolution of the orbit .",
    "if the system is secularly stable against the gravitational radiation , one might see probably a shrinking ( @xmath52 ) figure - eight orbit as a consequence of decreasing the total energy ( @xmath53)and keeping the vanishing total angular momentum ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "indeed , a chirp signal caused by the back - reaction at the inspiraling phase plays a crucial role in the gravitational waves detection .",
    "furthermore , the numerical relativity seems necessary for evolving the system in its merging phase after the last stable orbit .",
    "a figure - eight orbit for a 3-body system illustrated that some of triple stars are capable of generating periodic waves .",
    "we showed also that the total angular momentum of this 3-body system is not carried away by gravitational waves .",
    "a waveform generated by this system is volcano - shaped and thus different from that of a binary system .",
    "our result will call our further attention to , for instance , n=4 ( or more ) cases .    before closing this paper , we mention the possibility of gravitational waves from 3-body systems in a ` periodic ' orbit such as a figure - eight .",
    "clearly the possibility seems extremely low though it is quite uncertain .",
    "a quick order - of - magnitude estimate is made as follows . as a new outcome of binary - binary scattering",
    ", the figure - eight orbit was discussed for presenting a way of detecting such an orbit in numerical computations ( heggie 2000 ) . according to the numerical result ,",
    "the probability of the formation of figure - eight orbits is a tiny fraction of one percent . here , we assume rather optimistically one per galaxy , which implies @xmath55 figure - eight systems within 100mpc . if @xmath49 distributes randomly with its mean of o(1au )",
    ", we use eq . @xmath56 to obtain @xmath57 gyr for @xmath58au . as a result , merging event rates are of the order of @xmath59 event / gyr within 100 mpc , which is extremely low .",
    "therefore , the above estimate suggests that figure - eight sources may be less relevant to ligo and other detectors .",
