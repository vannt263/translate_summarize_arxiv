    "<S> we establish a simple method to assess the quantum fisher information required for resolving two incoherent point sources with an imaging system . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting cramr - rao bound shows that the standard rayleigh limit can be surpassed by suitable coherent measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly find these optimal strategies and present a realization for gaussian and slit apertures . </S>",
    "<S> this involves a projection onto the optimal bases that is accomplished with digital holographic techniques and is compared with a ccd position measurement . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results unequivocally confirm unprecedented sub - rayleigh precision .    </S>",
    "<S> optical resolution is a measure of the ability of an imaging system to resolve spatial details in a signal . as realized long ago  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this resolution is fundamentally determined by diffraction , which smears out the spatial distribution of light so that point sources map onto finite spots at the image plane . </S>",
    "<S> this information is aptly encompassed by the point - spread function  ( psf )  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the diffraction limit was deemed an unbreakable rule , nicely epitomized by the time - honored rayleigh criterion  @xcite : points can be resolved only if they are separated by at least the spot size of the psf of the imaging system .    the conventional means by which one can circumvent this obstruction are to reduce the wavelength or to build higher numerical - aperture optics , thereby making the psf narrower . </S>",
    "<S> in recent years , though , several intriguing approaches have emerged that can break this rule under certain special circumstances  @xcite . despite their success , these techniques are often involved and require careful control of the source , which is not always possible in every application .    quite recently , a groundbreaking proposal  @xcite has re - examined this question from the alternative perspective of quantum metrology . </S>",
    "<S> the chief idea is to use the quantum fisher information to quantify how well the separation between two poorly resolved incoherent point sources can be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> the associated quantum cramr - rao lower bound ( qcrlb ) gives a fair bound of the accuracy of that estimation . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly enough , the qcrlb maintains a fairly constant value for any separation of the sources , which implies that the rayleigh criterion is secondary to the problem at hand .    in this letter , we elaborate on this issue presenting quite a straightforward way of determining the quantum fisher information . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , we find the associated optimal measurement schemes that attain the qcrlb . </S>",
    "<S> we study examples of gaussian and sinc psfs , and implement our new method in a compact and reliable setup . for distances below the rayleigh limit , </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty of this measurement is much less than with direct imaging .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first set the stage for our simplified model . </S>",
    "<S> we follow lord rayleigh s lead and assume quasimonochromatic paraxial waves with one specified polarization and one spatial dimension , @xmath0 denoting the image - plane coordinate . to facilitate possible generalizations , we phrase what follows in a quantum parlance . a coherent wave of complex amplitude @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> can thus be assigned to a ket @xmath2 , such that @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a vector describing a point - like source located at  @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we consider a spatially - invariant unit - magnification imaging system characterized by its psf , which represents its normalized intensity response to a point light source . </S>",
    "<S> we shall denote this psf as @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> two incoherent point sources are imaged by that system . for simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> we consider them to have equal intensities and to be located at two unknown points @xmath7 of the object plane . </S>",
    "<S> the task is to give a sensible estimate of the separation @xmath8 . the relevant density matrix , which embodies the image - plane modes , can be jotted down as @xmath9 where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the momentum operator that generates displacements in the @xmath0 variable . in the @xmath0-representation , @xmath12 appears as the normalized mean intensity profile , which is the image of spatially - shifted psfs ; namely , @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that the momentum acts as a derivative @xmath14 , much in the same way as in quantum optics .    for points close enough together ( @xmath15 ) , which we shall asume henceforth </S>",
    "<S> , a linear expansion gives @xmath16 where @xmath17^{-1/2}$ ] is a normalization constant . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial point is that @xmath18 , so the spatial modes excited by the two sources are not orthogonal , in general . </S>",
    "<S> this overlap is at the heart of all the difficulties of the problem , for it implies that the two modes can not be separated by independent measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> to bypass this problem , we bring in the symmetric and antisymmetric states @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are normalization constants . when @xmath22 , these modes are orthogonal . </S>",
    "<S> this happens when ; for example , the psf is inversion symmetric , which encompasses most of the cases of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the modes in ( [ eq : modes ] ) constitute a natural set for writing the density operator . actually , in this set @xmath12 is diagonal @xmath23 , with eigenvalues @xmath24 and @xmath25 .        as we are estimating the separation @xmath26 , the pivotal quantity is the quantum fisher information  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is defined as @xmath27 $ ] , where the symmetric logarithmic derivative @xmath28 is the selfadjoint operator satisfying @xmath29  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a direct calculation finds that @xmath30   \\simeq    \\langle \\psi | p^{2 } | \\psi \\rangle \\ , , \\ ] ] and @xmath31 turns out to be independent of @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> the qcrlb ensures that the variance of any unbiased estimator @xmath33 of the quantity @xmath26 is then bounded by the reciprocal of the fisher information ; viz , @xmath34 as this accuracy remains also constant , considerable improvement can be obtained if an optimal quantum measurement , saturating ( [ eq : qcrlb ] ) , is implemented .    </S>",
    "<S> before we proceed further , we make a pertinent remark . </S>",
    "<S> the classical fisher information for this problem reads as @xmath35 performing again a first - order expansion in @xmath32 , @xmath36 can be expressed in terms of the psf @xmath37 : @xmath38^{2}}{i ( x ) }    \\ , \\mathrm{d}x \\ , .\\ ] ] now , @xmath39 goes to zero quadratically as @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , in this classical strategy , detecting intensity at the image plane is progressively worse at estimating the separation for closer sources , to the point that the classical crlb diverges at @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this divergent behavior has been termed the _ </S>",
    "<S> rayleigh s curse _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , there is much more information available about the separation of the sources in the phase of the field than in the intensity alone .    from our previous discussion </S>",
    "<S> , it is clear that the projectors @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) comprise the optimal measurements of the parameter @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fishq ] ) , the antisymmetric mode @xmath44 gives the leading contribution and thus most useful information can be extracted from the @xmath45 channel . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the wave function of the optimal measurement becomes @xmath46 where the @xmath0 representation of the quantum fisher information is @xmath47^{2 } \\ </S>",
    "<S> , \\mathrm{d}x \\,.\\ ] ] let us consider two relevant examples of psfs ; the gaussian and the sinc : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are effective widths that depend on the wavelength . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fishqx ] ) it is straightforward to obtain the quantum fisher information for these two cases : @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal measurements are then @xmath53 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to project on these functions , one needs to separate the image - plane field in terms of the desired spatial modes . </S>",
    "<S> this has been implemented in our laboratory with the setup sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] . </S>",
    "<S> two incoherent point - like sources were generated by a digital light projector ( dlp ) lightcrafter evaluation module ( texas instruments ) , which uses a digital micromirror chip ( dmd ) with square micromirrors of 7.6  @xmath54 m size each . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for a precise control of the points separation by individually addressing two particular micromirrors . </S>",
    "<S> the dmd chip was illuminated by an intensity - stabilized he - ne laser equipped with a beam expander to get a sufficiently uniform beam . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial incoherence is ensured by switching between the two object points , so that only one was on at a time , keeping the switching time well below the detector time resolution .    </S>",
    "<S> the two point sources were imaged by a low numerical - aperture lens and shaped by an aperture placed behind the lens . </S>",
    "<S> a circular diaphragm produced airy rings , but these are well approximated by a gaussian psf . </S>",
    "<S> the sinc psf was obtained by inserting a squared slit . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally measured the values @xmath55  mm and @xmath56  mm . </S>",
    "<S> the rayleigh criterion for these values are @xmath57 and @xmath50 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the two - point separations @xmath26 were varied in steps of @xmath58  mm , which corresponds to steps @xmath59 for the gaussian and @xmath60 for the sinc . </S>",
    "<S> the smallest separations attained are 13 times smaller than the rayleigh limit for the gaussian and 10 times for the sinc .    </S>",
    "<S> the projection onto any basis is performed with a spatial light modulator ( crl opto ) in the amplitude mode . </S>",
    "<S> we prepare a hologram at the image plane produced as an interference between a tilted reference plane wave and the desired projection function @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> when this is illuminated by the two - point source , the intensity in the propagation direction of the reference wave is @xmath62 different projections can be obtained with different reference waves .    to prepare the hologram , </S>",
    "<S> nominal psf parameters ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) were measured in advance . for the gaussian psf , we prepared projection on both the zeroth- and first - order hermite - gaussian modes . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of the zeroth - order mode is used to assess the total number of photons in each measurement run . for the sinc </S>",
    "<S> , the image was also projected on the psf itself and its first spatial derivative .    </S>",
    "<S> the desired projection is carried by the first diffraction order . to get the information , </S>",
    "<S> the signal is fourier transformed by a short - focal lens and detected by a cooled electron - multiplying ccd ( emccd ) camera ( raptor photonics ) working in the linear mode with on - chip gain to suppress the effects of read - out noise and dark noise . as sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] , the outcome of a measurement consists of two photon counts detected from the fourier spectrum points representing spatial frequencies connected with the reference waves . </S>",
    "<S> this data carries information about the separation of the two incoherent point sources .    </S>",
    "<S> the excess noise of emccd gain @xmath63 constitutes a remaining noise source . </S>",
    "<S> the numbers of photons @xmath64 and @xmath65 detected in the psf @xmath66 and antisymmetric ( optimal ) modes @xmath67 , respectively , was determined by using the emcccd pixel capacity and @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the relative frequency of measuring the antisymmetric projection was calculated as @xmath68 , the denominator @xmath69 being roughly the total number of detected photons . </S>",
    "<S> the estimator of the separation is then obtained by solving the relation @xmath70 for @xmath32 . in doing </S>",
    "<S> so we make no assumption about the smallness of @xmath26 , which helps to produce unbiased estimates of larger separations .    </S>",
    "<S> to determine estimator characteristics , 500 measurements for each separation were carried out . </S>",
    "<S> results are sumarized on the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results ] . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal method overcomes the direct position measurement for small and moderate separations . for the gaussian psf ( left panel ) and the smallest separation @xmath59 , </S>",
    "<S> the experimental mean squared estimator ( mse ) is 2.35@xmath71qcrlb ; i.e. , more than 20 times smaller than the error of the position measurement ( @xmath72qcrlb ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the sinc , the experimental mse is @xmath73qcrlb for the smallest separation , which is @xmath74 times lower than the error of the position measurement ( @xmath75qcrlb ) . </S>",
    "<S> we mention in passing that the optimal measurement of the sinc psf is more challenging due to very fast oscillations of the psf derivative . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the results are quite satisfactory good and in complete agreement with the theory .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have developed and demonstrated a simple technique that surpasses traditional imaging in its ability to resolve two closely spaced point sources . </S>",
    "<S> the method does not require any exotic illumination and is applicable to classical incoherent sources . </S>",
    "<S> much in the spirit of the original proposal  @xcite , our results stress that diffraction resolution limits are not a fundamental constraint but , instead , the consequence of traditional imaging techniques discarding the phase information present in the light .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our treatment also suggests other directions of research . whereas the point source represents a natural unit for image processing ( upon which hinges the very definition of psf ) , other `` quantum units '' </S>",
    "<S> can be further expanded and processed in a similar way . </S>",
    "<S> optimal detection can then be tailored to suit the desired target . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown this for two particular cases of projections . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly provides a novel and not yet explored avenue for image processing protocols . </S>",
    "<S> we firmly believe that this approach will have a broad range of applications in the near future .    </S>",
