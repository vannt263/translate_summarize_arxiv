    "ever since its discovery , the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite has fascinated physicists for its quantum - mechanical implications , which are completely foreign to our classical prejudices .",
    "it also has also proved useful in producing fractional statistics for charged particles in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite . as the particle completes a circuit around a localized magnetic flux core as in fig .",
    "1(a ) , its wavefunction will pick up a phase , altering the naive expectation that bosons ( fermions ) must always be in symmetric ( antisymmetric ) wavefunctions .",
    "similarly , in 3 + 1 dimensions , a coupling of the form @xmath0 would produce the same type of effect , whereby a particle ( coupled to @xmath1 ) passing through a closed loop ( coupled to @xmath2 ) acquires a statistical phase @xcite @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) .    an instantonlike mechanism to utilize this fact in heterotic superstring theory @xcite ( where such a @xmath3 coupling arises naturally from anomaly cancellation ) was proposed by harvey and liu @xcite , whereby one string will momentarily open up and pass over another string before collapsing again , as shown in figure 2 . the magnitude of this spin - statistics - violating effect was estimated to be of order @xmath4 , assuming that one string must open up to at least the de broglie wavelength of the other .",
    "naively , @xmath5 gev , and so this is prohibitively too small to be observed , but if @xmath6 tev ( as in some recent warped models @xcite @xcite ) then perhaps this effect is observable at achievable energies and worth revisiting .",
    "note that this intrinsically stringy effect would never show up in the spacetime effective action , which is a perturbative expansion in small @xmath7 .    in this paper ,",
    "i attempt to explicitly construct these worldsheet instantons but find there are no solutions in the model proposed by harvey and liu .",
    "i then consider additional terms that may yield a solution but are considerably more difficult to analyze .",
    "these solutions , if they exist , would likely scale not with the energy but rather with fixed parameters in the theory , making them easier to detect with current experiments at low energy .",
    "we will assume that this instanton process happens in 3 + 1 minkowski space after compactification .",
    "the action for the first string with momentum @xmath8 and coupled to the kalb - ramond 2-form @xmath9 is @xmath10.\\ ] ] note that the term containing @xmath9 is imaginary and thus produces a phase in the path integral , and that we are considering worldsheet instanton solutions so the momentum @xmath8 is real .",
    "the action for the second string ( which we approximate as a particle ) with momentum @xmath11 coupled with charge @xmath12 to the pseudoanomalous @xmath13 gauge field @xmath14 is @xmath15.\\ ] ] again note that the term coupling to @xmath14 is imaginary .",

    "this spacetime action is introduced as @xmath21 [ \\mathcal d b ] \\",
    "e^{is_{gauge}}\\ ] ] meaning the imaginary string source terms for @xmath9 and @xmath14 are real source terms from the perspective of the spacetime action .",
    "the worldsheet and worldline then produce , respectively , @xmath22 and @xmath23 flux tubes with width @xmath24 ( this is reversed from the usual case due to the @xmath25 term ) .",
    "if we approximate these as infinitesimally thin , we may neglect the gauge kinetic terms and integrate the fields out , resulting in the effective action equal to@xmath26 thus the phase shift of the wavefunction will be proportional to this  linking number , \" a topological quantity equal to the number of times the worldline @xmath27 will pass through the worldsheet @xmath28 .",
    "we will now attempt to construct solutions whereby this happens dynamically .",
    "in the heterotic string theory , with different compactifications we can get different values of @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is determined by the massless fermion content of the theory . in the case of compactification on a calabi - yau manifold @xcite",
    "we break @xmath31 and then embed the spin connection in the gauge group .",
    "this yields @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the euler number of the calabi - yau , and the fermion charges are @xmath34 .    rather than simply look for generic solutions to the equations of motion",
    ", we look for solutions which minimize the action for a given value of the linking number . to facilitate this ,",
    "let us repeat the previous derivation of the phase shift more explicitly . by taking the strong coupling limit @xmath35 for fixed @xmath20 as above , we can neglect the gauge kinetic terms and so easily obtain exact solutions @xmath36 } , \\\\",

    "for the zero - modes @xmath43 this is trivial , as can be seen by momentarily considering the first string to also be pointlike . by choosing @xmath44",
    ", the strings will both simply travel along straight lines in the direction of their respective momenta until they intersect at @xmath45 , then a linking is obtained by briefly expanding the first string s worldsheet . any other choice of @xmath46 or @xmath47",
    "would require the strings to either  swerve \" or else further enlarge the worldsheet , both of which increase the action .",
    "we can then perform a bogomolnyi transformation and express the ( real part of the ) action as a sum of squares plus a topological term : @xmath48 the constant @xmath49 is yet to be determined .",
    "a minimal - action solution is then obtained by setting the two squared terms to zero .",

    "they can not be massless and so @xmath52 is spacelike . the bps equation for @xmath53",
    "can then be written as @xmath54 to solve this we decompose @xmath42 into a complete basis , beginning with ( timelike ) @xmath55 and then defining the three spacelike unit vectors @xmath56 as transverse to this , such that @xmath57 are also transverse to @xmath58 .",
    "the ansatz then consists of a complex function @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) representing the positive ( negative ) chirality in the @xmath61 plane and a real function @xmath62 in the @xmath63-direction , @xmath64 then @xmath65 .",
    "choosing the convention @xmath66 , we can substitute ( [ x ] ) into ( [ bpsx ] ) to see that the @xmath55 component is trivially satisfied , whereas @xmath59 and @xmath62 must obey the relations @xmath67 , \\\\",

    "the lack of instanton solutions should have been anticipated from the action in ( [ wspi ] ) , which shows that there is no interaction between the two strings , merely a phase . with nothing to set a lower bound on how close the strings may approach , all paths are smoothly contractable to the trivial solution .",
    "the intuition of @xcite that a distance cutoff is fixed via the de broglie wavelength fails because the linking number projects onto the transverse worldsheet - worldline separation and so is not aware of their respective momentum eigenstates .",
    "one may try to remedy the situation by relaxing the assumption of infinite coupling and instead consider a finite value of @xmath79 .",
    "such an approach would modify the green s function to give the flux tubes widths and so might seem to provide a distance cutoff @xmath80 .",
    "unfortunately this would still not produce an interaction term in the worldsheet action , merely change the action s topological term from the linking number into a finite - width - version of the linking number .    the most natural way to produce",
    "a valid interaction is to recall that the ( left - moving component of the ) first string may also carry a charge @xmath81 under the pseudoanomalous @xmath13 gauge field , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the holomorphic @xmath13 current normalized so that @xmath84 . were we to also approximate this string as infinitesimally thin , a kaluza - klein reduction of the worldsheet would result in the purely imaginary term @xmath85 just like the analogous term in @xmath86 , which contributes only a path integral phase , but at nonzero string size this also contains a real component , which affects the worldsheet dynamics . at infinite coupling @xmath35",
    "this additional term produces only worldsheet self - interactions , so we must go to finite coupling to yield an interaction between the two strings .",
    "the maximal radius @xmath87 of the worldsheet should be where the tension of the string @xmath88 is balanced by the force of electrostatic repulsion @xmath89 , so there is an equilibrium reached at roughly @xmath90 the addition of ( [ ds1 ] ) to the action for strings with @xmath91 could then plausibly produce instanton solutions , and could be analyzed using techniques similar to those employed here . unfortunately , explicit solutions for this model are likely much more difficult to construct due to the necessity of finite coupling .",
    "if such instantons did exist , they would produce phases in the path integral leading to small violations of spin - statistics , most noticeably the pauli exclusion principle ( pep ) for fermions . depending on whether they scaled with energy or fixed parameters in the theory , observing these violations",
    "could either come from high - energy or high - precision experiments .",
    "energy scales of order 14 tev will soon be available from the large hadron collider , though it is uncertain to what extent it would be sensitive to extremely small phases in scattering amplitudes .",
    "the first precision test of the pep was performed by ramberg and snow @xcite by running current through a copper cylinder and looking for forbidden x - ray transitions . a similar technique used by the ongoing vip ( violations of the pauli exclusion principle )",
    "experiment @xcite has thus far constrained the deviation away from fermi statistics in terms of the ignatiev - kuzmin - greenberg - mohapatra @xmath92 parameter @xcite @xcite as @xmath93 this bound is expected to improve another 2 orders of magnitude over the next few years due to larger integrated currents . though the energy scale is low at only 8 kev , the incredible precision means this might be a viable way of detecting superstring - motivated violations .",
    "in this paper we have examined heterotic string worldsheet instantons , which could potentially produce a statistical phase and violate spin - statistics . they are found to not exist in the simplest case considered here but more general models may produce solutions .",
    "unfortunately the analysis of such generalizations is beyond the scope of this paper , requiring explicit solutions to gauge theories at finite coupling . in the auspicious case",
    "in which there is a measurable effect , this could be an experimentally viable way of testing string theory and could provide detailed information about the microscopic parameters .",
    "it would also be interesting to include the effects of extra dimensions rather than a simple compactification .",
    "the violation of spin - statistics , even if slightly , could have dramatic physical and even cosmological @xcite consequences .",
