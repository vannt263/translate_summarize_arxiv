    "gravitational microlensing occurs when a foreground object passes through or very near the line of sight of a background source star generating a well known symmetric light curve profile .",
    "if the foreground lens object is a star with an orbiting planet , then the presence of the planet may be detectable via a brief disturbance in the single lens light curve @xcite .",
    "this effect can potentially be utilized to detect planets with masses ranging from those of gas giants right down to terrestrial planets @xcite .",
    "the short timescales of these deviations , ranging from a few days for giant planets to hours for terrestrial planets , and their unpredictability , present considerable challenges in any observational program . while some encouraging results have been obtained @xcite , no firm detections of planets by microlensing",
    "have previously been obtained .    in this letter",
    "we report observations , obtained by ogle and moa , of the event ogle  2003blg235/moa  2003blg53 ( hereafter o235/m53 ) that was independently detected in both survey programs .",
    "we observed a 7 day deviation that was strongly detected in both surveys .",
    "we show that an extreme mass ratio binary microlensing model best reproduces the observed features in the light curve .",
    "presently , galactic bulge microlensing events are discovered and then alerted by the two independently operating survey groups ogle @xcite and moa @xcite .",
    "the microlensing event ogle  2003blg235 ( @xmath3=18:05:16.35 , @xmath4=@xmath528:53:42.0 , j2000.0 ) was first identified and alerted by the ogle ews system @xcite on 2003 june 22 .",
    "it was independently detected by moa on 2003 july 21 and alerted as moa  2003blg53 .",
    "ogle observations were carried out with the 1.3 m warsaw telescope at las campanas observatory , chile , which is operated by the carnegie institute of washington , equipped with a mosaic ccd camera with 8192@xmath68192 pixels .",
    "the images were obtained in the i band with an exposure time of 120 seconds each .",
    "the observations presented here come from the ogle - iii phase of the ogle survey and started in august 2001 .",
    "additional photometry of the star was also collected during ogle - ii phase ( 19972000 ) .",
    "this dataset indicates , however , no variability of the object during that period and was not used in further analysis .",
    "moa observations were carried out from the mt john observatory in new zealand with a 0.6 m telescope equipped with a mosaic ccd camera with 4096@xmath66144 pixels .",
    "the moa images were obtained using 180 second exposures with a broad band red filter with its throughput centered on the standard i band .",
    "the photometry was derived using difference imaging analysis carried out independently by the ogle and moa teams on their respective datasets .",
    "this method is the current state - of - the - art for photometric accuracy in crowded fields @xcite .",
    "our analysis resulted in two sets of time - series photometry in the i band corresponding to 183 ogle measurements and 1092 moa measurements during 20002003 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] we show the light curve for this event on various timescales from march 2000 to the present .",
    "the long term behavior is typical for single point mass microlensing events , and it is similar to the almost 2000 other events discovered in the galactic bulge since 1993 .",
    "the unique feature of o235/m53 is , however , a short duration deviation from the profile expected for a single lens , seen clearly in both datasets during 2003 july 1421 .",
    "moreover , a spike , characteristic of those binary microlensing events where the source enters or exits a bounded `` caustic '' region in the magnification map projected on the sky , was observed and well covered by moa on 2003 july 21 .",
    "this caustic region was crossed in 12% of the overall lens einstein radius crossing time .",
    "this short duration , combined with the small ( @xmath025% ) amplitude of the photometric deviation in the caustic region interior , suggests an extreme mass ratio binary system .    as well as",
    "regular monitoring in the i band , several v band observations were obtained by ogle at various magnifications of the event .",
    "these were not used in the microlensing modeling , but they were used to constrain the source and lens star properties . by plotting the linearized fluxes in the i and v bands against each other , a model independent measurement of the color index of the source star was determined .",
    "we obtained @xmath7 .",
    "using @xmath8 mag for the interstellar reddening towards the source @xcite , the corrected color index of @xmath9 indicates a g type source star .",
    "the modeling of the observed light curve of o235/m53 was performed independently by three groups using different methods to generate numerical binary microlensing light curves @xcite , and all three found the solution that is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] .",
    "the observable quantities for all microlensing events are the einstein radius crossing time , @xmath10 , the impact parameter @xmath11 ( in einstein radius units ) of the source star trajectory with respect to the lens center - of - mass ( c.o.m . ) , and the time , @xmath12 , of the closest approach to the c.o.m . for binary microlensing events ,",
    "one also measures the mass ratio , @xmath13 , the transverse separation , @xmath14 , of the lens components , and the position angle , @xmath15 , of the binary with respect to the source  lens transverse velocity . for caustic crossing events ,",
    "one also measures the ratio , @xmath16 , of the apparent angular radius of the source star to that of the einstein ring .",
    "in addition to these 7 physical parameters , there are two linear scaling parameters between the magnification and the flux units for each passband , giving a total of 11 parameters for the modeling . in our modeling procedure , we searched for local @xmath17 minima using minimization procedures that allowed all 11 parameters to vary simultaneously .",
    "our light curve modeling also employed a surface limb darkening profile appropriate for a g type star assuming a metalicity that is approximately solar .    in table",
    "[ tab : param ] , we list the physical microlensing parameters for the best fitting model shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : lc ] .",
    "this model has @xmath18 for 1267 degrees of freedom and an extreme mass ratio of @xmath19 , which is a strong indication that the secondary may be a planet .",
    "since microlensing light curves generally allow a much more accurate determination of the secondary : primary mass ratio , than the absolute mass of either body , the most sensible way to distinguish planetary microlensing events from those due to binary systems is through a criterion based on the mass ratio parameter @xmath20 .",
    "there is a well known minimum in the distribution of mass ratios for binary stars and planetary systems , which is known as the  brown dwarf desert .",
    "\" there are few systems known with @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "thus it is sensible to define the boundary between stellar binary and planetary binary microlensing events in between these @xmath20 values to minimize any possible ambiguity .",
    "this leads to a criterion of @xmath22 for a planetary microlensing event , and so o235/m53 is clearly in the planetary event category .",
    "we have carried out a systematic search in parameter space to try to find sets of model parameters that might explain the observed light curve with a larger mass ratio .",
    "binary microlensing models with @xmath23 that traverse a caustic curve in @xmath24 days have much larger magnifications inside the caustic curve than is observed for o235/m53 .",
    "these binary lens events also have much larger deviations from a single lens light curve before and after the caustic crossings .",
    "as the mass ratio is decreased , the best fit light curves approach the observed light curves , with much weaker caustic crossing deviations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : caustic ] , we show a close - up of the 7 day deviation with the best fit planetary model , compared with the best non - planetary model with @xmath25 and best fit single lens model .",
    "the non - planetary binary models and single lens models are strongly disfavored with fit @xmath17 values that are larger by @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath17 improvement for the best fit model is quite significant in both the moa and ogle data sets ( see table  [ tab : param ] ) .",
    "the failure of the non - planetary binary model can be seen in the fig .",
    "[ fig : caustic ] inserts .",
    "this model predicts both stronger caustic signals and significant deviations 1320 days after the second caustic crossing that are not consistent with the observations .",
    "this model also shows some discrepancies at magnifications @xmath28 , but these are not as strongly excluded due to the higher photometric uncertainties at lower magnification .    also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : caustic ] is a planetary model with an earlier caustic crossing and a larger planet mass ratio : @xmath29 .",
    "this fit represents a distinct local minimum of the @xmath17 surface , and is disfavored by only @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "this is not accounted for by our 1@xmath32 uncertainty on @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , we have increased the upper error estimate on the planetary mass ratio to 0.0011 , so that the actual uncertainty in @xmath20 will be bounded by our error estimates at the 3@xmath32 level . in table",
    "[ tab : param ] we also list the parameters for these alternative models .    finally , the first ogle observation after the second caustic crossing indicates a magnification below all of the binary models shown by about @xmath33 .",
    "such an outlier is not unusual because the real photometric error distributions for crowded field photometry generally have larger wings than a gaussian distribution .",
    "three of the 183 ogle measurements are outliers from the best fit by @xmath34 , and 16 are outliers by @xmath35 .",
    "these outlier points do not appear to cluster in the vicinity of the planetary deviation .",
    "if this single data point did indicate a real light curve deviation , it could be explained by a small variation to the planetary microlensing model , such as a moon orbiting the planet , but there is no non - planetary model that could help to explain it .",
    "most microlensing events have only a single measureable parameter , @xmath10 , that constrains the lens mass , distance , and tranverse velocity with respect to the line - of - sight to the source .",
    "however , time resolved observations of binary event caustic crossings resolve finite source star effects and partly remove these degeneracies @xcite , by allowing a measurement of the einstein angular radius given by @xmath36 .    using the flux parameters of the microlensing fit , we obtained @xmath37 for the source star and @xmath38 for the blended component .",
    "this source star magnitude , plus the v ",
    "i color from section 2 , can be compared to the bulge color magnitude diagram of @xcite , and this indicates that the source is probably a bulge star near the main sequence turn - off . to determine the angular radius of the source star we used the color - color relations of @xcite together with empirical relations between @xmath39 and surface brightness derived from interferometry observations of nearby main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath40 @xmath41as , which combined with our measurement of @xmath42 , yields @xmath43 @xmath41as .",
    "this yields the following relation between the lens mass and distance @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "if we combine this relation with the mass luminosity relations of @xcite for main sequence stars , and require that the lens luminosity at a given distance does not exceed the blend flux , we obtain an upper limit ( 90% confidence ) of @xmath46 kpc .",
    "thus , if the lens is a main sequence star , it must be in the galactic disk .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : like ] , we show eqn .",
    "[ eqn : md ] together with the results of a maximum likelihood analysis based on our measurements of the einstein ring and its characteristic crossing time .",
    "the likelihood function was calculated using the galactic disk models of @xcite .",
    "we then obtain with 90% confidence : @xmath47 kpc from which we infer the lensing system to comprise an m2m7 dwarf star of mass @xmath48 m@xmath49 with a giant planetary companion of @xmath50 m@xmath51 ( jupiter masses ) .",
    "the planet is in a wide orbit with a transverse separation of @xmath52 au .",
    "another possibility for the lens is that it could be a remnant object such as a white dwarf , neutron star , or black hole .",
    "if the lens is a white dwarf with mass 0.6 m@xmath49 , eqn .",
    "[ eqn : md ] would place it a distance of 5.5 kpc . in this case",
    ", the microlensing parameters would imply a 2.5 m@xmath51 planet orbiting the white dwarf with a transverse separation of 2.8 au .",
    "in section  3 we concluded that the observed light curve of o235/m53 is best described by a binary lensing model with an planetary mass ratio of @xmath19 .",
    "our definition of the planetary nature of the secondary lens by means of the mass ratio is optimal when the mass ratio can be measured , but it is useful to consider other possible definitions . another potential dividing line between planets and brown dwarfs",
    "is the solar metalicity threshold for sustained deuterium burning at 13.6 m@xmath51 , although deuterium burning itself has little relevance for planet formation .",
    "the situation in the case of o235/m53 was helped by the measurement of finite source effects .",
    "if the lens is a main sequence star , then as shown in the previous section , it must be an m dwarf with a @xmath53m@xmath51 planetary companion .",
    "there is a non - negligible chance that the lens is a white dwarf and a much smaller chance that it is a neutron star , but in both cases , a planetary companion below the nominal 13.6 m@xmath51 threshold is required . only in the unlikely case of a massive black hole primary , could the secondary be outside the range traditionally associated with a planet .",
    "there are some prospects for follow - up observations of this event .",
    "our measurements of the finite source effects imply a proper motion of the lens with respect to the source of @xmath54 .",
    "high resolution imaging carried out @xmath55years from now with jwst or adaptive optics systems should be able to resolve the lens and source stars providing direct measurements @xcite of the color and brightness of the lens , as well as confirmation of the proper motion measurement .",
    "we present these observations as a demonstration of the planetary microlensing phenomenon .",
    "the power of microlensing is in its ability to acquire statistics on many systems @xcite .",
    "these include planets in wide orbits , very low mass planets , and even planets in other galaxies @xcite .",
    "the challenge now to the microlensing community is to develop effective strategies to find more planetary microlensing events .",
