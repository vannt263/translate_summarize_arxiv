    "detecting electron counting statistics has become a major experimental challenge in mesoscopic physics .",
    "first attempts to measure non - gaussian effects in current noise have revealed that the detection problem is quite subtle . in particular , the experiment@xcite found that the third current cumulant was not described by the simple theoretical prediction,@xcite but was masked by the influence of the measurement circuit causing an additional `` cascade '' correction.@xcite recent experiments demonstrated a measurement of the third current cumulant without cascade corrections,@xcite and the detection of individual electron counting statistics.@xcite stringent bandwidth requirements in measuring the third cumulant suggested that further experimental advances would require a new approach .    a conceptually different way to measure rare current fluctuations is with a threshold detector,@xcite the basic idea of which is analogous to a pole vault : a detection event occurs when the measured system variable exceeds a given value .",
    "a natural candidate for such a detector is a metastable system operating on an activation principle.@xcite by measuring the rate of switching out of the metastable state , information about the statistical properties of the noise driving the system may be extracted . a threshold detector using an on - chip conductor which contains a region of negative differential resistance@xcite was proposed by the authors and shown to be capable of measuring large deviations of current .",
    "tobiska and nazarov proposed a josephson junction ( jj ) threshold detector,@xcite the simplest variant of which ( see fig .  [ circuit ] ) operates essentially in a gaussian regime.@xcite the third cumulant contribution is small@xcite and may be extracted using the asymmetry of the switching rate with respect to bias current , as has been demonstrated in recent experiments.@xcite    = 6.5 cm    [ circuit ]    in this letter we solve kramers problem@xcite of noise - activated escape from a metastable state beyond the gaussian noise approximation and investigate how the measurement circuit affects threshold detection . starting with general hamiltonian - langevin equations which includes deterministic dynamics , dissipation , and fluctuations ,",
    "we represent the solution as a stochastic path integral of hamiltonian form@xcite by doubling the number of degrees of freedom . in the weak damping case ,",
    "the dynamics is dominated by energy diffusion , which we account for by a change of variables , enabling an effectively two - dimensional representation .",
    "we calculate the escape rate via an instanton calculation , and obtain a formal solution of kramers problem.@xcite applying these general results to a jj threshold detector , we account for the influence of the measurement circuit and find that the cascade corrections are a consequence of the non - equilibrium character of the noise.@xcite",
    "in order to reformulate and solve kramers problem beyond gaussian noise , we introduce a theoretical framework that relies on a separation of time scales : slow motion of a deterministic system on a time scale @xmath0 is affected by quickly fluctuating noise sources with correlation time @xmath1 .",
    "quite generally , this situation can be described by hamiltonian - langevin ( hl ) equations .",
    "for instance , in a two - dimensional phase space @xmath2 the equations of motion are @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hamiltonian that generates deterministic motion , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are white noise sources . on the intermediate time scale @xmath7 ,",
    "such that @xmath8 , the sources are markovian and fully characterized by the generating function @xmath9 of their cumulants ( irreducible moments ) : @xmath10 .",
    "while langevin equations may be solved by standard methods in stochastic physics,@xcite the methods fail when applied to higher - order cumulants .",
    "the reason is that slow variations of @xmath11 and @xmath12 affect the noise sources and lead to _",
    "cascade corrections_,@xcite which can not be obtained from linearized differential equations ( [ hle ] ) . following the steps of refs .",

    "we obtain the probability distribution @xmath20 , while fixing the final @xmath21 variables turns the spi into the moment generating function @xmath22 .",
    "the large parameter @xmath23 allows the saddle - point evaluation of the spi and thus requires solving hamilton s equations of motion in the extended space.@xcite there always exists a trivial solution @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , that describes the `` average '' dynamics in physical space with a null action @xmath27 , giving the proper normalization of the distribution @xmath28 . in the context of the generalized kramers problem , one has to find a non - trivial _ instanton _ solution @xmath29 of eq .",

    "below we apply the theory outlined here to the stochastic dynamics of a josephson threshold detector .",
    "the circuit in fig . 1 shows the essential part of the detector comprised of the jj with josephson energy @xmath59 , and the capacitor , @xmath60 .",

    "this leads to the equation of motion for the superconducting phase @xmath67 , @xmath68 where we used the relation @xmath69 .    in order to simplify the following analysis and concentrate on our main message",
    ", we make a number of assumptions , most of which will be relaxed later .",
    "first , we consider an ohmic system and bias resistor , so that @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , @xmath73 are the system and bias conductances , and the constant currents @xmath74 , @xmath75 are just tunable parameters .",

    "we further assume a high - impedance circuit , so that the back flow part of the bias current @xmath77 and the nyquist noise may be neglected , @xmath78 , which we refer to as the _ ideal detection _ scheme .",

    ", we define the normalized total bias current as @xmath85 .",
    "dissipation leads to relaxation of the jj into one of its metastable states . in the supercurrent state ,",
    "the phase is localized in one of the potential wells , so that @xmath86 . in the dissipative state , the phase drifts along the bias which generates the non - zero voltage drop @xmath87 . in the remaining part of the paper we investigate noise",

    "here the system conductance is small , @xmath88 , so the phase oscillates with the plasma frequency @xmath89 , where @xmath90 .",
    "the energy relaxes slowly with the rate @xmath91 to the local potential minimum .",
    "we further assume the separation of time scales , @xmath92 , so that the noise source @xmath62 is markovian . comparing ( [ hle - phase ] ) and ( [ hle ] ) ,",
    "we identify @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , so the equations for the escape rate and `` instanton line '' read @xmath96 where @xmath49 is the generator of the cumulants of the dissipative part of the system current , @xmath84 , and @xmath97 plays the role of an effective charge .",
    "we first consider the system in thermal equilibrium with gaussian nyquist noise , @xmath98 , as a checkpoint of the theory .",
    "the cumulant generator acquires the simple form @xmath99 , where the first term comes from the linear response of the system current @xmath100 to the potential @xmath69 , while the second term is the noise contribution . averaging @xmath49 over the period of oscillations , we observe that the term @xmath101 cancels , so that @xmath102 . using eq .",

    "two terms which contain @xmath119 and @xmath120 come with the factor @xmath121.@xcite this factor vanishes to leading order in damping , because for fixed energy @xmath122 is an odd function of time over the oscillation period .",

    "this contribution is analogous to the cascade correction@xcite directly observed in third cumulant.@xcite the correction is generally not small and may even change the sign of the total cumulant .",
    "for instance , for systems far from equilibrium @xmath135 , where @xmath136 are the dimensionless fano factors , we obtain @xmath137 .",
    "in this regime the conductance is large , @xmath138 , and the dynamics is entirely due to slow phase relaxation with the rate @xmath139 .",

    "the following analysis is analogous to that of the weak damping regime .",
    "we first expand @xmath49 to second order in @xmath143 and find from the equations of motion that @xmath144 and @xmath145 . substituting these results back to the action we immediately obtain kramers formula ( [ kramers ] ) with @xmath115 replaced with @xmath146 .",
    "next we observe that the argument of @xmath49 is small , namely @xmath147 due to the separation of time scales requirement .",
    "we collect all the terms to third order in this parameter and evaluate them perturbatively using the above results for @xmath143 and @xmath122 .",

    "we now remark on the application of our results to the detection of non - gaussian fluctuations .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ parameters ] that @xmath154 as @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , in the strong bias regime the third cumulant contribution in ( [ wdr ] ) and ( [ sdr ] ) is suppressed compared to the kramers term @xmath155 . but even for a relatively weak bias , when @xmath156 , non - gaussian effects are small .",
    "indeed , it is easy to estimate the correction as @xmath157 , where the jj quality factor @xmath158 in the weak damping regime ( wd ) , and the ratio @xmath159 due to the separation of time scales .",
    "similarly , in the strong damping regime ( sd ) , @xmath160 , the correction is of order @xmath161 , where @xmath162 due to the separation of time scales . since @xmath163 itself can not be too large for the escape to be detected , in experiments one should try to saturate the above inequalities and use the asymmetry of the third cumulant ( [ cumulant1 ] ) as a function of the current bias @xmath164 .",
    "next , we briefly discuss nonideal detection and nonlinear effects .",
    "the finite conductance of the bias resistor @xmath73 contributes to the total conductance of the circuit @xmath165 and the nyquist noise @xmath166 adds to the total noise power .",
    "therefore , in eqs .",
    "( [ wdr]-[sdr ] ) one has to replace @xmath72 with @xmath167 and the effective temperature with @xmath168 .",
    "the nonlinearity of the system current leads to the correction @xmath169 to @xmath49 , and thereby to an additional contribution to the total third cumulant , @xmath170 , in both transport regimes considered above .",
    "quite remarkably , this total third cumulant is related via @xmath171 to the instantaneous fluctuations of the voltage @xmath87.@xcite    we finally note that in the experiment of ref .  [ ] the circuit corrections have not been observed , which we explain by a very low impedance of the circuit , @xmath172 , operating in the weak damping regime with @xmath173 . indeed , in this case @xmath174 ( assuming @xmath175 ) , therefore the circuit corrections are suppressed by a small factor @xmath176 . on the other hand , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ rate1 ] ) is @xmath177 and the second term can be estimated as @xmath178 , where @xmath179 in this case .",
    "therefore the relative contribution of the third cumulant to the total action increases by the factor @xmath180 , which makes it favorable to use a low - impedance circuit .    in conclusion",

    "we have applied this result to the josephson junction threshold detector and evaluated the third current cumulant contribution to the escape rate .",
    "the back action of the electrical circuit on the measured noise is entirely a non - equilibrium effect , which leads to `` cascade '' corrections for the third cumulant",

[ circuit ] ) , so we also expand the second current cumulant in the voltage @xmath87 , namely @xmath184 , where we recall that @xmath185 is the voltage across the system , and the coefficients above are evaluated at @xmath134 . using the josephson relation @xmath186 , and averaging ( [ a1 ] ) over the oscillation period at fixed energy , we now need to find the instanton line and solve the equation @xmath187 for @xmath188 .    as argued in the text ,",
    "the instanton solution @xmath188 is small for the jj , so the series may be inverted to find to third order in @xmath189 , @xmath190 inserting this instanton solution into the action , we obtain for the activation rate @xmath191    however , to leading order in damping , the average @xmath192 vanishes because @xmath193 is an odd function of time over the interval of one period .",

    "therefore , we use @xmath201 to write @xmath202 where the integral starts from the turning point nearest to the top of the barrier , @xmath203 .",
    "this is done because the escape of the jj into the running state happens at the top of the barrier , so the last part of the trajectory before escape must be fully accounted for .    integrating by parts , @xmath204 , we keep only the change in energy , and neglect the change in the turning point to this order . using the result ( [ edot ] ) ,",
