    "the study of particle correlations has been suggested as a means to search for a possible phase transition in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions.@xcite these particle correlations have the potential to probe the early stages of heavy ion collisions .",
    "if a deconfined phase of quarks and gluons exists in these collisions , the presence of these partonic degrees of freedom could directly influence the results of a correlation measurement .",
    "one such measurement is the study of long - range multiplicity correlations that extend over a range in pseudorapidity ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "a linear relationship has been experimentally shown in hadron - hadron collisions relating the multiplicity in the forward direction ( @xmath2 ) to the average multiplicity in the backward direction ( @xmath3).@xcite    @xmath4    the coefficient @xmath5 is referred to as the correlation coefficient .",
    "the value , @xmath6 , is a measure of uncorrelated particles . in the definition provided in  `` eq .",
    "( [ linear ] ) '' the maximum value of @xmath5 is one , corresponding to complete correlation between the produced particles . for @xmath7 ,",
    "all particles are uncorrelated .",
    "this relationship can be expressed in terms of the following expectation value:@xcite    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the backward - forward and forward - forward dispersions , respectively .",
    "this result is exact and model independent.@xcite all quantities in  `` eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) '' are directly measurable .",
    "the large pseudorapidity and angular coverage of the star experiment at rhic provides an ideal means to measure particle correlations with precision.@xcite    in phenomenological particle production models , the hadronization of color strings formed by partons in the collision account for the produced soft particles . in the dual parton model ( dpm ) , at low energies these strings are formed between valence quarks.@xcite at higher energies , there are additional strings formed due to the increasing contribution from sea quarks and gluons . in the dpm , this production mechanism is predicted to produce long - range multiplicity correlations in pseudorapidity . a long - range correlation could be an indication of multiple elementary inelastic collisions in the initial stages of an a+a collision.@xcite additionally , the color glass condensate ( cgc ) model predicts long - range correlations.@xcite the cgc model is a description of high density gluonic matter at small - x . in the cgc model , the incoming , lorentz",
    "contracted nuclei are envisioned as two sheets of colliding colored glass.@xcite in the initial stage of the collision , the color fields are oriented transverse to the beam direction . after the collision these color fields realign longitudinally .",
    "this produced state is referred to as the glasma , an intermediate state between the cgc and quark gluon plasma ( qgp).@xcite these longitudinal fields provide the origin of the long - range correlation and are similar to the strings in the dpm .",
    "the data utilized for this analysis are from year 2001 ( run ii ) @xmath0 = 200 gev au+au and year 2004 @xmath0 = 62.4 gev collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , as measured by the star ( solenoidal tracker at rhic ) experiment.@xcite the main tracking detector at star is the time projection chamber ( tpc).@xcite the tpc is located inside a solenoidal magnet generating a constant , longitudinal magnetic field . for this analysis ,",
    "data was acquired at the maximum field strength of 0.5 t. all charged particles in the tpc pseudorapidity range @xmath11 and with @xmath12 gev / c were considered .",
    "this @xmath1 range was subdivided into forward and backward measurement intervals of total width 0.2@xmath1 .",
    "the forward - backward correlations were measured symmetrically about @xmath13 with varying @xmath1 gaps ( measured from the center of each bin ) , @xmath14 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , 1.0 , 1.2 , 1.4 , 1.6 , and 1.8 units in pseudorapidity .",
    "fig [ fig1 ] depicts a schematic representation of the forward - backward correlation and its measurement .",
    "the collision events were part of the minimum bias dataset . the minimum bias collision centrality was determined by an offline cut on the tpc charged particle multiplicity within the range @xmath15 .",
    "the centralities used in this analysis account for 0 - 10 , 10 - 20 , 20 - 30 , 30 - 40 , 40 - 50 , 50 - 60 , 60 - 70 , and 70 - 80% of the total hadronic cross section .",
    "an additional offline cut on the longitudinal position of the collision vertex ( @xmath16 ) restricted it to within @xmath17 cm from @xmath18 ( center of the tpc ) .",
    "approximately two million minimum bias events at @xmath0 = 200 gev and 0.7 million events at @xmath0 = 62.4 gev satisfied these requirements and were used for this analysis .",
    "corrections for detector geometric acceptance and tracking efficiency were carried out using a monte carlo event generator and propagating the simulated particles through a geant representation of the star detector geometry .        in order to eliminate the effect of statistical impact parameter ( centrality ) fluctuations on this measurement , each relevant quantity ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 )",
    "was obtained on an event - by - event basis as a function of star reference multiplicity , @xmath23 .",
    "a linear fit to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , or a second order polynomial fit to @xmath21 and @xmath22 was used to extract these quantities as functions of @xmath23 .",
    "tracking efficiency and acceptance corrections were applied to each event .",
    "these were then used to calculate the backward - forward and forward - forward dispersions , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , binned according to the star centrality definitions and normalized by the total number of events in each bin .",
    "an autocorrelation exists if the centrality definition overlaps with the measurement interval in @xmath1 space .",
    "therefore , there are three @xmath1 regions used to determine reference multiplicity : @xmath15 ( for measurements of @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 ( for measurements of @xmath26 ) , or @xmath27 ( for measurement of @xmath28 ) .",
    "this is possible due to the flat @xmath1 yield of the star tpc within the measurement ranges being considered .",
    "fig . [ fig2 ] presents the mean multiplicity @xmath19 and @xmath20 , in a forward and backward pseudorapidity region along with @xmath21 and @xmath22 as functions of reference multiplicity , @xmath23 .",
    "the results are calculated event - by - event for every unit @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 demonstrate a linear dependence over much of the centrality range .",
    "only statistical uncertainties are present and are less than 1% , except for the highest multiplicities . the results in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are uncorrected for tracking efficiency and acceptance . due to statistical limitations",
    ", it is not possible to apply corrections for every value of @xmath23 .",
    "one value for the correction , calculated for each centrality , is applied to the resultant values @xmath29 , and @xmath22 for every event in that centrality .",
    "therefore , all events falling within a particular centrality have the same correction .    fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the results for the correlation coefficient @xmath5 and the backward - forward and forward - forward dispersions , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , for most central ( 0 - 10% ) au+au collisions at @xmath0 = 200 gev .",
    "the correlation is approximately flat as a function of the pseudorapidity gap .",
    "it is expected that if only short - range correlations are present ( mostly from sources such as cluster formation , jets , or resonance decay ) , then @xmath5 would decrease rapidly as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "it has been argued that the presence of these long - range correlations at larger than @xmath28 can not be due to final state effects , and are therefore due to the conditions in the initial state.@xcite this may be phenomenologically similar to fluctuations larger than the event horizon being created during an inflationary phase in the early universe that later become smaller than the event horizon.@xcite        a comparison of the correlation coefficient , @xmath5 , in 0 - 10% most central @xmath0 = 200 and 62.4 gev is shown in fig .",
    "there is a slight difference in the evolution of the correlation at small values of @xmath30 , but for @xmath31 the value of the correlation coefficient is approximately flat as a function of @xmath30 for the two energies .",
    "however , for the @xmath0 = 62.4 gev data , the value of @xmath5 is lower by up to @xmath32 15% .",
    "it is expected that @xmath5 has a dependence on incident energy ( and atomic number ) of the colliding nuclei.@xcite data for cu+cu collisions at the same energies are currently under study .",
    "the measurement of a long - range correlation demonstrates a coherent phenomenon in the initial state of these heavy ion collisions .",
    "it may then be possible to correlate this effect with that of another collective phenomenon , percolation .",
    "the particle production mechanism in high - energy heavy ion collisions can be described by the hadronization of color strings stretched between the colliding nuclei.@xcite at high energies it is possible for partons from different nucleons to begin to overlap in the plane transverse to the propagation direction of the nuclei , forming clusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]).@xcite at the percolation threshold , a cluster that spans the entire system is formed .",
    "this point can be characterized by the critical percolation density parameter , @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath33 has been predicted theoretically@xcite and the percolation density parameter itself has been measured experimentally in heavy ion collisions by the star experiment.@xcite .",
    "it has been shown by these measurements that the critical value , @xmath33 , for the `` local '' prediction ( @xmath33 = 1.72 ) is exceeded in most centralities of au+au collisions at @xmath0 = 200 , while for @xmath0 = 62.4 au+au collisions all centralities lie at or below the critical percolation threshold . a slightly lower value for @xmath33 is predicted in the infinite ( continuum ) system . in that case ,",
    "central au+au at @xmath0 = 62.4 gev will lie above @xmath33 .",
    "it is thus important to try and experimentally constrain @xmath33 .",
    "if the presence of long - range correlations and percolation are related , it may be possible to constrain @xmath33 by examining the long - range correlation as a function of the measured percolation density parameter , shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath5 shown here is the long - range component only.@xcite it is seen that the extracted long - range component of the correlation coefficient @xmath5 crosses zero in the area around a percolation density parameter value of two .",
    "this is higher than most theoretically predicted values for @xmath33 .",
    "though this result is intriguing , further study is required .",
    "results have been presented on the energy dependence of the forward - backward correlation coefficient , @xmath5 , in au+au collisions .",
    "it is seen that the value of @xmath5 is approximately flat over a wide range in pseudorapidity gap , @xmath30 , at @xmath0 = 200 gev .",
    "this indicates a long - range correlation as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "were only short - range correlations present , a rapid decay in the value of @xmath5 would be expected as @xmath30 increases .",
    "these long - range correlations can be ascribed to multiple elementary inelastic collisions . these are predicted in models such as the dual parton model and the color glass condensate / glasma phenomenology .",
    "the long - range correlation appears to persist at @xmath0 = 62.4 gev , though at a lower value than @xmath0 = 200 gev .",
    "further investigations are proceeding to determine an experimental range for the critical percolation density parameter , @xmath33 . at the point where the extracted long - range correlation value goes to zero ,",
    "the value of the percolation density parameter is @xmath32 2 .",
    "this is larger than several theoretical predictions for @xmath33 .",
    "additional study is required to characterize this relationship .",
