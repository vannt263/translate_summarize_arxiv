    "( ct ) is a phenomenon of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , whose characteristic feature is that small color - singlet objects interact with hadrons with small cross sections @xcite .",
    "cross section for the interaction of such small object , or small size configuration ( ssc ) , with a hadron target has been calculated in qcd using the factorization theorem @xcite .",
    "these qcd calculations confirmed the hypothesis of f. low @xcite on smallness of the cross section for the interaction of ssc with a hadron , if the gluon density in the hadron is not very high ( moderately small @xmath5 ) .",
    "they also predict a related phenomenon of _ color opacity _ when the gluon density becomes very large ( at small @xmath5 ) and ssc interacts with the hadron with large cross section @xcite .",
    "the prerequisite for observing ct is to select a sample containing ssc s via a hard process ( i.e. with large @xmath6 , high @xmath7 , or large produced mass ) . to suppress non - perturbative ( not ssc ) background different additional restrictions",
    "should be imposed depending on the process .",
    "for instance for hard exclusive @xmath8 leptoproduction , in addition to large @xmath0 , selection of the longitudinally polarized mesons is required .",
    "to measure the ssc - nucleon cross sections one should study absorption of the ssc propagating through nuclear matter . in order to clearly observe ct",
    "it is necessary that the ssc lives long enough to traverse distances larger than the size of the target nucleus .",
    "another requirement is that ssc stays small while propagating through the nucleus .",
    "these requirements , which are quantified in terms of the coherence length and the formation length , are discussed later .",
    "various processes have been proposed to study ct phenomenon .    * coherent vector meson ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) production at small @xmath12 . for near - forward",
    "( @xmath13 ) coherent production and complete ct , one expects that the cross section for the nuclear target is related to that for the nucleon target by @xmath14 gluon shadowing / antishadowing in nuclei is neglected in this formula , but for moderately small @xmath15 this effect is expected to be small . usually in experiments the @xmath12-integrated coherent cross sections are measured , for which ct predicts an approximate @xmath16 dependence . using more realistic nuclear form factors one predicts @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "+ otherwise , if the color - singlet objects , while propagating in nuclear matter , interact with nucleons with large cross sections , the expected @xmath18-dependence is weaker ; @xmath19 for the cross sections comparable or larger than the pion - nucleon cross section . * incoherent ( quasi - elastic ) vector meson ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) production on nuclei . for complete ct and neglecting effects of the gluon shadowing / antishadowing in the nuclei one expects @xmath20 here , for the nuclear target the meson @xmath21",
    "is produced on a single nucleon of the nucleus and @xmath22 denotes the system of spectator nucleons .",
    "* coherent or incoherent production of excited vector meson states @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "ct predicts the same @xmath18 dependence of @xmath9 and @xmath23 , or @xmath10 and @xmath24 .",
    "this contrasts with the naive expectations whereby one may expect larger absorption for excited mesons since they are larger .",
    "* coherent diffractive dissociation of hadrons or photons into high @xmath25 di - jets .",
    "such process probes the small transverse - size component of the projectile wave - function as well as ct effects . for ct",
    "the @xmath12-integrated cross section of coherent diffractive production of high @xmath25 di - jets has the same @xmath18-dependence as for the processes ( a ) . using more realistic wave functions",
    "one predicts for asymptotically high energies @xmath26 dependence , where @xmath27 is in the range 1.45  1.60 , depending on @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "* coherent vector meson production on light nuclei ( deuteron , helium ) in the large @xmath12 range , where the effects of double ( multiple ) scattering are important .",
    "ct will suppress the double ( multiple ) scattering contribution to the differential cross section @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "* @xmath18-dependence of the fraction of large rapidity gap ( diffractive ) events .",
    "ct predicts an @xmath18 independent fraction ; otherwise it will grow with @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "* large @xmath0 quasielastic @xmath29 scattering on nuclei , @xmath30 . in the ct",
    "limit the cross section will be proportional to @xmath18 , as for process ( b ) @xcite . *",
    "large @xmath12 quasielastic @xmath31 scattering on nuclei , @xmath32 .",
    "also for this process , for complete ct the expected @xmath18 dependence is like for process ( b ) @xcite .    in searches for ct",
    "a commonly used quantity , measured in experiments , is the _ nuclear transparency _",
    "@xmath33 which is the ratio of the cross section per nucleon for a selected process on a nucleus @xmath18 to the corresponding cross section on a free nucleon . for the incoherent processes",
    "ct predicts @xmath34 independently of @xmath18 . for the large absorption in the nuclear matter",
    "@xmath35 will be smaller than unity and will decrease with @xmath18 .",
    "although the nuclear transparency could be defined also for coherent processes , usually cross sections for coherent production on different nuclei are compared directly . as mentioned above , for @xmath12-integrated coherent cross sections ct predicts @xmath36 , whereas for a larger absorption the @xmath18-dependence is weaker .    in the following discussion we concentrate on exclusive vector meson production ( vmp ) , the processes ( a)(c ) , which could be studied at the compass experiment @xcite .",
    "exclusive meson production on the nucleon , free or bound in the nucleus , can be viewed as proceeding according to the diagram shown in fig .",
    "kinematic variables used in this paper are listed in table [ kinvar ] .",
    ".kinematic variables used in the text .",
    "[ kinvar ] [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in this section we compare compass capabilities to demonstrate ct to those of previous experiments in which exclusive @xmath8 leptoproduction on nuclear targets was studied .",
    "we concentrate on this reaction , as among different exclusive vmd channels it has the largest cross section . for the comparison we have selected experiments which covered @xmath0 range extending to large values , bigger than 2 gev@xmath1 .",
    "this condition is satisfied for the following experiments : hermes @xcite , nmc @xcite and e665 @xcite .    the published results from the hermes experiment concern the incoherent exclusive @xmath8 production on @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 targets .",
    "the electron beam energy was 27.5 gev and the covered @xmath0 and @xmath41 ranges are @xmath42 and @xmath43 fm .",
    "like in all fixed - target experiments with lepton beams , the covered kinematic range is such that for a given @xmath0 the average value of @xmath41 decreases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the highest values of the hermes data where one may expect to observe the onset of ct are correlated with the small values of @xmath41 below 2 fm .",
    "the increase of the nuclear transparency observed for @xmath40 is explained as due to the reduced coherence length , without resorting to ct .",
    "wider kinematic ranges were coverd by experiments using high - energy muon beams .",
    "nmc has published the data on coherent and incoherent exclusive @xmath8 production on @xmath38 , c and ca targets .",
    "the muon beam energy was 200 gev and the data cover the ranges @xmath44 and @xmath45 fm .",
    "for the nmc kinematic range , the large values of @xmath41 which exceed the diameter of the largest target nucleus ( ca ) , @xmath46 fm , correspond to @xmath47 . in principle , in this range it is possible to study @xmath0 dependence of nuclear absorption in order to observe ct not obscured by effects of small @xmath41 .",
    "however , due to the moderate statistics of the data , such detailed analysis was not possible for nmc .",
    "the most favourable kinematical conditions were realised in the e665 experiment due to the high muon beam energy of 470 gev .",
    "the experiment has published the data on incoherent exclusive @xmath8 production on @xmath37 , @xmath38 , c , ca and pb targets .",
    "the data were taken in a wide @xmath0 range , including also very small values @xmath48 , and in a wide range of @xmath41 , @xmath49 fm . at small and moderate @xmath0 values , @xmath50 gev@xmath1 , which correlate with @xmath41 values exceeding the diameter of the lead nucleus , precise measurements of the nuclear transparency were obtained .",
    "they indicate strong nuclear absorption . at the highest @xmath0 bin , @xmath51 , the nuclear transparency increases in qualitative agreement with ct .",
    "however , the data in this bin correspond to a wide range of @xmath41 , @xmath52 fm , and therefore could be affected by effects due to the reduced coherence length .",
    "the low statistics in the large @xmath0 bin did not allow more detailed studies .",
    "the compass data at medium and large @xmath0 ( ft trigger ) will cover the kinematic range similar to that of the nmc data .",
    "the expected statistics for the carbon target will be about 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the nmc data for the same target .",
    "this increase is in particular due to higher beam intensity and larger acceptance in the compass experiment . similarly like in the e665 experiment compass",
    "will use also lead target and will extend measurements to small @xmath0 .",
    "the statistics of compass data will be significantly higher also than that of e665 .",
    "for example , for incoherent events at @xmath51 the ratio of nuclear transparencies for lead and carbon will be determined with accuracy better than 3% , comparing to about 30% for e665 . another more sensitive method to study nuclear effects in exclusive @xmath8 production , the one by using coherent production ,",
    "will be employed in compass as well . due to large statistics",
    "splitting of compass data in several @xmath0 and @xmath41 bins as well as the selection of events with longitudinal or transverese @xmath8 polarization will be possible .",
    "in addition to the @xmath8 production , we will study exclusive production of @xmath9 , @xmath11 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 and their ratios in order to demonstrate ct . for these channels",
    "the analysis will be similar to that for @xmath55 , but the rates will be lower due to the smaller production cross sections .",
    "the estimates of the required period of data taking and of the target thicknesses are subject of further analysis .",
    "we consider also a possibility to study ct via coherent production of hadron pairs with large relative transverse momenta .",
    "the experimental procedure would be similar to that used in the fermilab experiment e791 @xcite , in which ct was observed in coherent diffraction of pions into high-@xmath25 di - jets .",
    "we will select a sample of events with high-@xmath25 hadron pair and an additional requirement that all observed charged hadrons carry at least 90% of the energy of @xmath56 .",
    "an estimate of @xmath12 will be obtained using momenta of all measured charged hadron tracks .",
    "the expected resolution in @xmath12 , which will be crucial for selection of the coherent sample , will be determined from a dedicated simulation and reconstruction of events with high-@xmath25 hadron pairs .",
    "finally we mention few experimental aspects which have to be further investigated .",
    "+ here we propose to position the nuclear targets downstream of the polarized target .",
    "then the ct physics could complement the standard compass program by using the downstream nuclear targets simultaneously with the polarized target .",
    "similar target configuration was already used during the 1985 running of the emc experiment , when the polarized target was used together with several nuclear targets situated downstream of pt .",
    "the effect of the downstream nuclear targets on the hadrons coming from the polarized target should be small .",
    "for instance , for the reconstructible tracks of hadrons from pt , only about 4% of slow pions from @xmath57 decays and about 1% of hadrons from @xmath58 decays will be in the acceptance of the proposed nuclear target @xcite .",
    "for the scattered muon coming from pt and passing through the nuclear target , the additional multiple coulomb scattering should result in a small increase of the errors of the reconstructed position of the event vertex .",
    "assuming a dedicated run with unpolarized targets , different target configurations for ct studies are possible .",
    "with more available space one could envisage targets at least about 4 times thicker than the thin targets presented earlier .",
    "thus the four - fold reduction of the data taking time will be possible . with an even larger amount of available beam time",
    ", one could expose more nuclear targets of different materials , and in addition the liquid hydrogen or deuterium targets .",
    "the latter ones are also important for measurements of _ off - forward parton distributions _",
    "( also referred to as _ skewed parton distributions _ or _",
    "generalized parton distributions _ ) @xcite . for a dedicated run with unpolarized targets",
    ", one could take advantage of a possibility of adding a recoil detector .",
    "this is crucial for certain processes , e.g. deep virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , but in any case it will help to reduce the non - exclusive background for any exclusive process .",
    "we have simulated and analysed exclusive @xmath59 muoproduction @xmath60 and @xmath61 at the compass experiment using thin nuclear targets of carbon and lead . for muon beam energy of 190 gev and a trigger for medium and large @xmath62 ,",
    "the covered kinematic range is @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "good resolutions in @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath12 ( @xmath67 ) and @xmath68 are feasible . an efficient selection of coherent or incoherent events is possible by applying cuts on @xmath67 . in order to obtain the samples of events initiated with a probability of about 80% by either @xmath69 or @xmath70 ,",
    "the cuts on the @xmath59 decay angular distribution of @xmath71 will be used .",
    "the search for ct could be facilitated by using the events with @xmath72 values exceeding the sizes of the target nuclei .",
    "the fraction of such events is substantial and the covered @xmath62 range seems sufficient to observe ct .",
    "we showed high sensitivity of the measured ratio @xmath73 of nuclear transparencies for lead and carbon for different models of nuclear absorption .",
    "good statistical accuracy of the measured @xmath73 may be achieved already for one year of data taking .",
    "these measurements , taken at different @xmath62 intervals , may allow to discriminate between different mechanisms of the interaction of the hadronic components of the virtual photon with the nucleus .    in conclusion",
    ", the planned comprehensive studies of exclusive vector meson production on different nuclear targets at the compass experiment should unambiguously demonstrate ct .",
