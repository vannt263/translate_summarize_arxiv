    "x - ray transients are a subclass of x - ray binaries whose brightness can vary by a factor of more than 100 .",
    "the main reason for those variations are changes in the mass accretion rate on to the compact object .",
    "the variations of the mass accterion rate can be related to an eccentric orbit , changes in the companion star , or instabilities of the accretion disk .",
    "igr  j19140 + 098  ( simbad corrected name igrj19140 + 0951 ) is an x - ray transient that was detected by integral  @xcite on march 6th during an observation of grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "it has also been observed later by rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) and ground - based optical and radio telescopes such as the nordic optical telescope ( not ) and the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) .",
    "integral  observed grs  1915 + 105   during revolution 48 ( 2003 mar 6 - 9 ) .",
    "a transient source was discovered @xcite in the field , @xmath0 from grs  1915 + 105   ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "standard integral  off - line science analysis software ( osa ) was used for the jem - x ( osa version 3 ) and ibis / isgri ( version 2 ) data reductions .",
    "mosaic images and combined spectra for the entire grs  1915 + 105   pointing were created following the standard data reduction process @xcite . the isgri 20 - 40 kev image of this observation is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the integral  position of igr  j19140 + 098  is @xmath1 , with an accuracy of 1.    a 2.2 ksec rxte observation was made on 2003 mar 10 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the rxte data was analyzed with the rex script available at the heasarc web site .",
    "proportional counter array ( pca ) spectra and lightcurves ( in 2 - 8 and 8 - 20 kev bands ) were extracted with standard screening criteria .",
    "the pca lightcurves ( figure 2 ) show some variations on timescales of one hundred seconds , but no periodicity is found .",
    "the observed hardness variations are not statistically significant .",
    "the timescale of the variations suggests a galactic origin .     and width @xmath2 .",
    "north is up and east is to the left .",

    "cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : fits ]    the spectra were analyzed with the xspec ( version 11.3 ) software . for pca ,",
    "the 3 - 20 kev energy range was used , and systematic errors of 1% have been used in the fitting . in the initial absorbed powerlaw fit , large residuals clustering around 6 kev are found when the spetrum is fitted with an absorbed powerlaw . adding a gaussian line at 6.5 kev to the model removed these residuals . with this model",
    "we obtain a @xmath3 of 1.4 .",
    "the hydrogen column is @xmath4 .",
    "the galactic column in this direction is @xmath5 ( ftool nh ) , the excess is probably either intrinsic to the system or caused by small - scale structures of the ism .",
    "the powerlaw photon index is @xmath6 , and the @xmath7 unabsorbed flux is @xmath8 , corresponding to @xmath9 .",
    "the gaussian line center is at 6.5 kev and equivalent width is 600 ev , which is very strong for an x - ray binary .",
    "we fitted the jem - x data between 3 - 20 kev and isgri data between 20 - 80 kev .",
    "systematic errors of 2% ( 10% for 4 - 7 kev data and",
    "20% for 3 - 4 kev data ) have been added to the jem - x spectrum .",
    "the data can be fitted with a simple absorbed powerlaw model , with column density fixed to @xmath10 .",
    "no normalization constant has been used between the instruments , as fitting gave a result of @xmath11 for the constant .",
    "the fit has @xmath12 that could be improved by 0.1 by adding an iron line , or allowing a freely varying absorbing column .",
    "however , removing the instrumental feature at 30 kev would improve the @xmath3 by 0.2 , so any smaller improvements to the fit can also be attributed to systematic effects .",
    "the powerlaw photon index is @xmath13 , and unabsorbed @xmath7 flux during the integral observation is @xmath14 , giving a luminosity of @xmath15 .",
    "the powerlaw photon indices of the isgri / jem - x and pca spectra are 2.8 vs 1.6 , each with an error of 0.1 .",
    "the 5 - 20 kev flux during the integral   observation is about four times higher than during the rxte observation .",
    "( the 5 - 20 kev band is used instead of the more common 2 - 10 as the former is entirely covered by the instruments and less affected by absorption or possible low - energy comptonization cut - off . )",
    "this suggests that a state transition between a steep power - law and a low - hard state has been observed .",
    "such states are characteristic of black hole low - mass x - ray binaries ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and therefore we suggest that igr  j19140 + 098  is a low - mass x - ray binary , possibly containing a black hole . to determine the nature of donor and compact object ,",
    "further observations are needed .",
    "igr  j19140 + 098  is in the error circle of the x - ray source exo  1912 + 097 @xcite , so it probably has been detected by exosat .",
    "( see also @xcite for bepposax wide field camera observations of the field . )",
    "the integral  field of igr  j19140 + 098  was observed with the nordic optical telescope ( not ) in spring 2003 . infrared images ( jhk ) of the field",
    "were taken , but no obvious counterpart for the source could be detected .",
    "unfortunately , the observations are too short to allow reliable photometry in any of the used bands . this summer , two nights of not observing time is allocated for further obervations of this field .",
    "the gmrt observations @xcite revealed one 3.5 mjy source within the error circle , but a probability of a spurious source at that brightness level is above 90% .",
    "a new x - ray source , igr  j19140 + 098  has been discovered with integral .",
    "analysis of integral  and rxte data shows that the spectral and temporal variability of igr  j19140 + 098  are best explained by a galactic x - ray binary , preferably one with a low - mass donor and a black hole",
    ". however , further observations are needed to determine the binary component types .",
