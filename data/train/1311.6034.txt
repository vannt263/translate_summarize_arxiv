    "among the three founders of hyperbolic geometry - lobachevsky , bolyai and gau    lobachevsky was the first to publish a complete treatise on the subject , namely , his _ elements of geometry _ @xcite ( 1829 ) .",
    "in fact , three years before that publication ( more precisely , on february 23 , 1826 ) , lobachevsky gave a lecture ( in french ) at the physical and mathematical section of kazan university , titled _ exposition succinte des principes de la gomtrie avec une dmonstration rigoureuse du thorme des parallles _ ( a brief exposition of the principles of geometry with a rigorous proof of the theorem on parallels ) .",
    "the exact content of the lecture is lost , but we know from lobachevsky s own report in his _ elements of geometry _ that the first part of that treatise is based on the material of the 1826 lecture .",
    "lobachevsky s _ elements of geometry",
    "_ , together with his later writings on hyperbolic geometry , constitute a corpus of memoirs which is much more than an introduction to hyperbolic geometry .",
    "they contain a complete development of differential and integral calculus in a non - euclidean setting and they reflect their author s profound vision on mathematics .",
    "we shall dwell on that in this article .",
    "let us mention right away gau s words , in his letter to the astronomer h. c. schumacher , dated 28 november 1846 , talking about one of lobachevsky s memoirs :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ in developing the subject , the author followed a road different from the one i took myself ; lobachevsky carried out the task in a masterly fashion and in a truly geometric spirit .",
    "i consider it a duty to call your attention to this book , since i have no doubt that it will give you a tremendous pleasure ... gaus s correspondence is published in volume viii of his _ collected works",

    "the reason was certainly the strong belief within the mathematical community that euclid s parallel axiom is a consequence of the other axioms of euclidean geometry and , therefore , that a geometry in which one takes as an axiom the negation of the parallel axiom , leaving all the other axioms of euclidean geometry ( that is , the lobachevsky geometry ) , would be self - contradictory .",
    "after his _ elements of geometry _",
    "@xcite , lobachevsky wrote several memoirs on the same subject , reworking some of the proofs , improving some details , and highlighting applications of his work outside the world of pure geometry , with the hope of attracting the attention of his colleagues .",
    "his efforts in that direction were vain , and his work was acknowledged only ten years after his death .",
    "these memoirs that he left , despite the fact that they all have the same aim , namely , to convince the reader that hyperbolic geometry exists , contain at some places remarks , examples , details and new computations which make them different from each other .",
    "these memoirs include the _ new elements of geometry _ @xcite ( 1835 ) ( a revised version of the 1829 _ elements of geometry _ ) , the _ applications of imaginary geometry to certain integrals _ @xcite ( 1836 ) , _ imaginary geometry and its applications _",
    "@xcite ( 1835 ) , _ imaginary geometry _ @xcite 1837 ( a revised version , in french , of the preceding memoir ) ,",
    "geometrical researches on the theory of parallels _",
    "@xcite ( 1840 ) , in german , and finally , his _ pangeometry _ @xcite ( 1855 ) , published first in russian and then in french .",
    "the _ pangeometry _ is lobachevsky s last work , written the year before his death .",
    "this memoir is a rsum of lobachevsky s work on non - euclidean geometry and its applications , and it is probably his clearest account of the subject .",
    "it is also the conclusion of his lifetime work , and the last attempt he made to acquire recognition .",
    "the subject of the present paper is not the birth of hyperbolic geometry .",
    "we shall rather focus on some important ideas contained in the _ pangeometry _ ( and in the previous papers ) , which include the following :    1 .",
    "the trigonometric formulae , which express the dependence of angles and edge lengths of triangles , are not only tools , but they are the basic elements of any geometry . in fact , lobachevsky shows that all the analytical and geometrical theorems follow from these formulae . 2 .",
    "analysis in the sense of differential and integral calculus can be done in hyperbolic space without the use of any euclidean model of hyperbolic space .",
    "( and indeed , lobachevsky developed differential and integral calculus without knowing of any euclidean model of his geometry .",
    "we recall by the way that the first such model was given by beltrami in 1868 , that is , more than twelve years after lobachevsky s death ) .",
    "3 .   there exist models of spherical and of euclidean geometry within hyperbolic geometry .",
    "4 .   if hyperbolic geometry were contradictory , then one could find a contradiction within euclidean or spherical geometry .",
    "the fact that lobachevsky expressed these ideas is rather unknown to mathematicians . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we shall see how these ideas arise in lobachevsky s work , and we shall comment on them .",
    "trigonometric formulae for spherical geometry , that is , equations giving relations between the side lengths and the angles at the vertices of spherical triangles , were known since greek antiquity .",
    "the classical proofs of these formulae use the embedding of the sphere in the ambient three - space , where the sides of triangles are arcs of great circles , that is , intersections of the sphere with planes passing through the origin , and the angles of triangles are the dihedral angles between the corresponding euclidean planes .",
    "these formulae were recovered and reproved , using various methods , by many mathematicians over several centuries .",
    "lobachevsky , in his memoirs on geometry , established a complete set of spherical trigonometric formulae .",
    "his methods of proof are based on a construction in hyperbolic 3-space which uses the notion of parallelism in hyperbolic geometry .",
    "we recall this notion before reporting on that proof .",
    "let us first remind the reader that the notion of parallelism in non - euclidean geometry is not identical to the euclidean one . in euclidean geometry , two lines are said to be parallel if they are coplanar and if they do not intersect .",
    "furthermore , in this setting , given a line @xmath0 and a point @xmath1 not on @xmath0 , there is a unique line containing @xmath1 and disjoint from @xmath0 , namely , the line containing @xmath1 and making a right angle with the segment joining perpendicularly @xmath1 to @xmath0 .",
    "now we consider the situation in the hyperbolic plane .",
    "let @xmath0 be a line and @xmath1 a point not on @xmath0 .",
    "the line that contains @xmath1 and makes a right angle with the perpendicular from @xmath1 to @xmath0 does not intersect @xmath0 ( otherwise we would have a triangle whose angle sum is greater than two right angles , which is not possible in neutral geometry , that is , in the geometry where one takes the euclidean axioms without the parallel postulate , that is , this axiom is neutralized : it may hold or may not hold ) .",
    "however , this line is not the unique line that contains @xmath1 and that is disjoint from @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , in hyperbolic geometry , one makes a distinction between two classes of disjoint pairs of lines , namely , _",
    "parallel _ lines and _ hyperparallel _ lines . a line _",
    "parallel _ to @xmath0 through @xmath1 is a line that does not intersect @xmath0 and that is the limit of two families of lines , those that intersect @xmath0 and those that do not intersect @xmath0 . with this definition , there are exactly two distinct lines through @xmath1 that are parallel to @xmath0 ( see figure [ loba38 ] ) .",
    "a line is said to be _ hyperparallel _ to @xmath0 if it is not parallel to @xmath0 and if it is disjoint from @xmath0 .    in the memoirs that lobachevsky wrote before the _ pangeometry _ , e.g. in his _ geometrische untersuchungen zur theorie der parallellinien _ to which he constantly refers in his _ pangeometry",
    "_ , he studied in detail this relation of parallelism , showing in particular that it is symmetric and transitive .",
    "the definition of parallelism in dimension @xmath2 is based on the planar definition .",
    "more precisely , two lines in hyperbolic @xmath2-space are said to be parallel if they are coplanar and if they are parallel in the hyperbolic plane that contains them .",
    "now we can review lobachevsky s proof of the spherical trigonometric formulae .",
    "lobachevsky starts with a hyperbolic triangle @xmath3 with a right angle at @xmath4 and with edges @xmath5 opposite respectively to the vertices @xmath6 .",
    "he considers the plane containing this triangle as sitting in hyperbolic 3-dimensional space and he makes the following construction .",
    "let @xmath7 be a geodesic line perpendicular to the plane of the triangle and consider the two planes @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( figure [ loba35 ] ) . in the plane @xmath8 ,",
    "construct the line @xmath10 parallel to the line @xmath7 . consider a third plane , containing the line @xmath10 and the point @xmath4 .",
    "this plane intersects the plane @xmath9 in a line @xmath11 parallel to @xmath7 .",
    "( lobachevsky proves this fact . )",
    "lobachevsky shows that the dihedral angles of the solid figure that is constructed over the base @xmath3 are completely determined by the angles of the triangle @xmath3 .",
    "now consider in the 3-dimensional space a geometric sphere centered at @xmath12 and of radius smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "it intersects the three planes passing by @xmath12 at three points @xmath14 .    in this situation , and in analogy with usual",
    "spherical geometry ( the geometry of a sphere embedded in euclidean 3-space ) , a spherical segment is defined as an arc in the intersection of the sphere by a ( hyperbolic ) plane passing through the center of the sphere , and a spherical triangle is defined as a triple of points joined by three spherical segments .",
    "( strictly speaking , one has to consider only spherical triangles contained in a hemisphere , in order to avoid pairs of points which can be joined by two distinct segments . )",
    "distances and angles on this geometric sphere are also defined in analogy with those of spherical triangles on a standard sphere embedded in euclidean 3-space : the distance between two points on the sphere is the ( hyperbolic ) angular distance of the rays starting from the origin and passing through these points , and the angle between two lines is defined as the dihedral angle made by the planes that pass through the center of the sphere and that contain these two lines .",
    "for instance , in figure [ loba35 ] , the angle at @xmath15 of the spherical triangle @xmath16 is the dihedral angle made by the planes @xmath17 and @xmath18 , etc .    from the dihedral angles of the solid figure constructed on the base @xmath3 , the angles of the spherical triangle @xmath16 are determined .",
    "lobachevsky shows in particular that the angle at @xmath19 is right .",
    "he then deduces the trigonometric formulae for the right spherical triangle @xmath16 using the ambient hyperbolic space , as in the classical way where one deduces the trigonometric formulae for a spherical triangle using the embedding of the sphere in a euclidean 3-space .",
    "passing to more standard notation where we have a spherical triangle @xmath3 with right angle at @xmath4 and with edges @xmath5 opposite to the vertices",
    "@xmath6 respectively , lobachevsky writes the following formulae :    @xmath20        after these trigonometric formulae for the right triangle , lobachevsky obtains the following formulae that are valid for an arbitrary spherical triangle , with sides @xmath5 opposite to angles @xmath6 ( figure [ loba36 ] ) :    @xmath21    he then notices that these formulae for the sphere in hyperbolic space coincide with the formulae of usual spherical geometry .",
    "he concludes with the following ( @xcite p. 22 of the english translation ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ it follows that spherical trigonometry stays the same , whether we adopt the hypothesis that the sum of the three angles of any rectilinear triangle is equal to two right angles , or whether we adopt the converse hypothesis , that is , that this sum is always less than two right angles .",

    "below , we shall point out another argument for the non - contradiction problem , which is also based on lobachevsky s work .",
    "we note by the way that this formal analogy was noticed by several authors , before and after lobachevsky .",
    "for instance ,",
    "j. h. lambert ( 1728 - 1777 ) , in his _ theorie der parallellinien _",
    ", written in 1766 and published posthumously , ( see @xcite and the forthcoming edition @xcite ) observed that certain geometrical properties of hyperbolic geometry  which for him was hypothetical  are obtained from analogous properties of spherical geometry by multiplying some distances by the imaginary number @xmath44 .",
    "he declared then that one should almost conclude that this geometry takes place on a  sphere of imaginary radius \" .",
    "f. a. taurinus ( 17941874 ) ( a contemporary of lobachevsky ) made a similar remark . in his memoir , also called _ theorie der parallellinien _",
    "( 1825 ) @xcite , taurinus obtained fundamental trigonometric formulae for hyperbolic geometry ( which was , from his point of view , like it was for lambert , purely hypothetical ) .",
    "he noticed the formal analogy between the spherical and the hyperbolic cases and he also declared that the hyperbolic trigonometry formulae are obtained by working on a sphere of  imaginary radius \" .",
    "likewise , beltrami , in his _ saggio di interpretazione della geometria non - euclidea _",
    "@xcite , showed that the trigonometric formulae for the pseudo - sphere ( which is a model he had constructed for the hyperbolic plane ) can be obtained from those of the usual sphere by considering the pseudo - sphere as a sphere of imaginary radius @xmath44 , and he attributed this observation to e. f. a. minding and to d. codazzi .",
    "soon after beltrami , klein , in his _ on the so - called non - euclidean geometry _",
    "( 1871 ) , while he worked for a common ground for the three geometries ( euclidean , spherical and hyperbolic ) in the setting of projective geometry , made the same remark :  the trigonometric formulae that hold for our measure result from the formulae of spherical trigonometry by replacing sides by sides divided by @xmath45 . \" ( @xcite  12 ) .",
    "we also refer the interested reader to the comments in the english translation of the _ pangeometry _ @xcite .",
    "let us also note that euler had also noticed the analogies between euclidean and spherical geometry formulae , and in several memoirs , he proved euclidean theorems and then their spherical analogues .",
    "for instance , in his memoir _ geometrica et sphaerica quaedam _ ( concerning geometry and spheres )",
    "@xcite euler considers the following problem : given a triangle and three segments , each segment joining the vertex of a triangle to the line containing the opposite side , find a condition so that the three segments lie on three lines that have a common point .",
    "then , denoting by @xmath6 the vertices of the triangle , @xmath5 the points on the respective sides and @xmath46 the intersection point of the three lines ( figure [ concourantes ] ) , euler finds , in the euclidean case , the relation @xmath47 in the spherical case , he finds the relation @xmath48          thus if we believe , like lobachevsky , that the trigonometric formulae are at the basis of all of geometry , then looking at the formal analogies between the formulae in the three geometries , one can try to argue ( as lobachevsky did ) that if there were a contradiction in one of the geometries then there would also be one in the other two , or at least in one of the other two .",
    "there is another argument that lobachevsky could have used for the consistency of his geometry .",
    "this is the fact that the _ proof _ of the trigonometric formulae of hyperbolic geometry are derived from the formulae of euclidean and of spherical geometry , as we pointed out in ",
    "[ s : spherical ] and  [ s : tr ] and , therefore , one might conclude that the ( hypothetic ) existence of a contradiction in hyperbolic geometry would come from a contradiction in euclidean or in spherical geometry .",
    "finally , let us recall that the consistency question was raised in precise terms by david hilbert , who reduced the consistency of the axiom set of euclidean geometry ( and of hyperbolic and spherical geometries ) to that of arithmetic .",
    "we also recall that gdel , in 1931 , proved that arithmetic with multiplication can not be shown to be consistent within arithmetic . in conclusion ,",
    "the consistency question of non - euclidean ( and euclidean ! ) geometries has been a long and difficult issue and it is not surprising that lobachevsky , who constantly thought about the consistency of his geometry , did not succeed in settling it , although there is more than enough evidence in his works to conclude with the relative consistency .",
