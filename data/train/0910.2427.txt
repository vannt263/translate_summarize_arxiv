    "the effects of imperfections and decoherence are arguably the most serious obstacle faced when trying to design a quantum computer .",
    "their study has led to the development of elaborate schemes for fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "these efforts have culminated in the _ threshold theorem _",
    "@xcite , which establishes that reliable computation is in principle possible given a sufficiently low error probability of each individual gate .",
    "a central idea underlying these results is the concatenation of codes , first formalized by forney  @xcite and later generalized to quantum error - correcting codes  @xcite . here",
    ", logical information is encoded in a recursive fashion , where the qubits constituting a codeword are themselves represented by an error - correcting code .",
    "this leads to an exponential reduction of the effective error rate in the number of concatenation levels .",
    "_ topological quantum computation _ ( tqc ) is an alternative ( and in some sense complementary ) approach to fault - tolerance  @xcite .",
    "the basic steps for tqc can roughly be summarized as follows ( but see  @xcite for an alternative complete set of basic operations ) : ( i )  create a certain initial state of non - abelian anyons ( e.g. , the state of many particle - antiparticle pairs , as explained below ) , ( ii )  braid the anyons around each other to perform gates , and ( iii )  measure the resulting state ( that is , the total topological charge of a region ) .",
    "the non - local nature of the encoding used here is expected to lead to significantly lower error rates compared to more standard implementations .",
    "moreover , gates are intrinsically robust due to the fact that  ( ii ) only involves topological operations .",
    "unfortunately , steps  ( i ) and ( iii ) of tqc are generally system - dependent , and require performing non - topological operations which are not naturally protected against noise .",
    "for example , measurement of topological charge involves making interferences from the observation of a non - topological quantity ( e.g. , current ) through approximate relations valid only in the given experimental setup .",
    "here we focus on the state preparation problem  ( i ) .",
    "we give a scheme for creating a suitable initial state purely by braiding , starting from an unknown state supported on a physically relevant subspace .",
    "this reduces tqc to a sequence of braids followed by measurement .",
    "it eliminates all unprotected operations apart from those at the end of the computation .",
    "the basis for our scheme is the fact that a region of a topologically ordered 2d - quantum medium can be regarded as a dot where a composite anyon resides .",
    "this composite object carries the total ( topological ) charge of all the anyons contained in that region .",
    "anyon systems therefore provide a natural mechanism for concatenated coding : fusion basis states of composite objects can be used to encode information . at each level of concatenation",
    ", a number of subregions are joined into a region forming a new composite object . ignoring the degrees of freedom within subregions ,",
    "the resulting encoding has the structure of a subsystem code  @xcite , where the hilbert space decomposes as  @xmath0 , and the logical information is encoded in  @xmath1 . here  @xmath2 describes the internal degrees of freedom of the composite anyons .",
    "importantly , computations in the code space  @xmath1 can be performed in the same manner as for the bare anyons . in particular",
    ", the complexity of braiding two regions around each other only scales polynomially with the size of their boundary .",
    "( this can be seen explicitly for schemes based on local code deformations . ) a similar statement can be made for the measurement of composite topological charge , which can be achieved by anyon interferometry  @xcite , for example .",
    "to compute , it is therefore sufficient to be able to prepare any state supported on the subspace  @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a state of a fixed number of anyons representing the logical state  @xmath5 of  @xmath6  computational qubits .",
    "we consider ( mixed ) states supported on a physically relevant subspace .",
    "we show that any such state  @xmath7 can be turned into a state supported on @xmath8 using reversible gates .",
    "moreover , we construct braid sequences implementing this efficiently . in other words , we construct a distillation procedure which concentrates the entropy of  @xmath7 into  @xmath2 . using this distillation procedure",
    "circumvents the need for measurements when preparing the initial state for computation .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : anyonbackground ] , we give some background on anyons and explain the action of the braid group . in section  [ sec : compositeanyondistillation ] ,",
    "we present our scheme for distillation of composite anyons .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect is the most well - known example of a topologically ordered state of matter . at filling fraction @xmath9 ,",
    "this system is believed to be in the universality class of the moore - read pfaffian state  @xcite , which is the @xmath10 state in the read - rezayi - sequence of states  @xcite .",
    "similarly , for @xmath11 , the system is believed to be described by the  @xmath12 read - rezayi - state .",
    "quasi - particle excitations above these states are superconducting vortices carrying fractional ( electric ) charge  @xmath13 .",
    "they are predicted theoretically to correspond to the anyons described by @xmath14  chern - simons - witten theory . in principle , these realize two of the most basic non - abelian phases : the ising tqft ( for @xmath10 ) and the fibonacci tqft ( for @xmath12 ) . at present , though , there is only some experimental evidence for the existence of these quasiparticles , and it is restricted to the former case  @xcite .",
    "fqh systems are not the only candidate systems for building a topological quantum computer . of particular interest",
    "are qudit lattice hamiltonians with topological order .",
    "examples are kitaev s toric code  @xcite , kitaev s honeycomb model  @xcite or levin- and wen s hamiltonian  @xcite . while these hamiltonians are unlikely to occur in nature , it is in principle possible to engineer systems with corresponding interactions , and some experimental proposals for doing so exist ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) . with an appropriate choice of hamiltonian ,",
    "anyons corresponding to any `` doubled '' ( non - chiral ) tqft can be obtained from such a construction .",
    "this approach to achieving topological order also has an additional advantage : the local hamiltonian terms can be interpreted as local stabilizers of a quantum error - correcting code of qudits . using this code for storage and processing of quantum computation",
    "merely requires the ability to measure syndromes locally , instead of requiring a system described by the hamiltonian . in this setting",
    ", the problem of decoherence at non - zero temperature ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) can be overcome by performing active error - correction  @xcite .",
    "indeed , this gives rise to excellent threshold results for quantum error - correction  @xcite .    to use a topologically",
    "ordered medium for computation , one requires the experimental ability to manipulate , i.e. , create , move ( braid ) and measure anyons . for fqh states , proposals for implementing anyonic charge measurements are most developed .",
    "these employ beams of probe quasiparticles ( e.g. , constituting a current along an edge ) , which are sent through an interferometric setup ( e.g. , by deforming the edge around a region to be measured ) .",
    "because of the non - abelian statistics , topological charge information can be deduced from the interference pattern observed by detecting whether a quasiparticle is present at the outputs of the interferometer . since the latter detection requires coupling to e.g. , the electric charge of the probe anyons ,",
    "this is a rather indirect procedure which is susceptible to noise . nevertheless , this is at present the most promising experimental approach to observing anyonic statistics .",
    "in contrast to measurements , current theoretical proposals in the fqh setting for other operations , such as controlled movement of individual particles , perhaps have little chance of actually being realized .",
    "the manipulations required to perform a topological quantum computation in a qudit lattice system consist of local unitaries and measurements acting on a small number of qudits at a time . this has been studied in detail for the toric code  @xcite and the levin - wen - hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "anyons are created and moved by applying certain `` ribbon operators '' ( which can be decomposed into locally acting operators ) .",
    "some proposed schemes  @xcite directly use a topologically degenerate ground space and proceed by adiabatically deforming the hamiltonian in a local fashion .",
    "measurements of topological charge require decoding the encoded information , and thus are automatically subject to noise .",
    "corresponding circuits are discussed e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "we formulate our scheme for the fibonacci theory , the simplest computationally universal anyon model .",
    "we proceed with a short description of the corresponding braid group representation . for more details",
    ", we refer to the literature .",
    "excellent introductions can be found e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "the fibonacci model has only one non - trivial particle  @xmath15 with fusion rule @xmath16 . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a ( infinite ) plane with @xmath17  localized dots , each of which can support a @xmath15 particle ( but may also have trivial topological charge ) .",
    "we assume that the total topological charge is  @xmath18 .",
    "the hilbert space then decomposes into a direct sum @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the space of @xmath6 @xmath15-anyons localized at dots specified by the subset  @xmath21 .",
    "universal quantum computation can be performed in a subspace @xmath22 , but here we take a more general viewpoint .",
    "the space  @xmath23 of @xmath17  @xmath15-anyons is characterized by the action of the braid group . in the fqh setting , it is the degenerate eigenspace of states with localized excitations at specified locations ( i.e. , the dots ) . in topological computation schemes based on the degenerate ground space of a qudit lattice model , the space  @xmath23 is a certain subspace of the ground space . here",
    "dots correspond to defects , i.e. , holes in the latttice structure or ( possibly extended ) areas where the local hamiltonian terms are different from the bulk .",
    "the mapping between states of the physical system and the abstract anyonic space  @xmath24 is discussed extensively in the literature ( see e.g. ,  @xcite and  @xcite for lattice systems ) .",
    "similarly , braids correspond to certain ( physical ) operations on the system , as discussed above . here",
    "we will restrict our discussion to the abstract anyonic formalism which provides a system - independent description of the action of the braid group .",
    "we use the standard diagrammatic representation of states and operators on @xmath25 ( see e.g. ,  @xcite for more details ) : to every tree with trivalent vertices and  @xmath17  leaves , we can associate an orthonormal basis of @xmath25 with elements given by different labelings of the edges by @xmath26 consistent with the fusion rules ( i.e. , with the number of edges labeled  @xmath15 incident to any vertex not equal to  @xmath18 ) .",
    "we fix the label at the root of the tree to  @xmath18 corresponding to the trivial topological charge at the @xmath27-boundary .",
    "the labels attached to the edges connected to the leaves determine which of the spaces @xmath20 a labeling corresponds to .",
    "the tree specifies the order of fusing , and basis elements corresponding to different trees are related by so - called @xmath28-moves . in the following diagrams ,",
    "we represent edges with the label  @xmath15 by solid lines , whereas edges with the trivial label  @xmath18 will be dotted or omitted altogether .",
    "an @xmath28-move then is a local substitution of subgraph by a linear combination as specified by the identities @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the golden ratio .",
    "the braid group @xmath31 on @xmath17  strands is generated by the elementary braids  @xmath32 satisfying the artin relations @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "to describe the action of  @xmath31 on  @xmath25 , one represents the generators as @xmath37 group multiplication then corresponds to stacking such diagrams . to apply a braid  @xmath38 to a basis element  @xmath39 ,",
    "one attaches the graphical representation of @xmath40 to the leaves of the tree specifying  @xmath41 , and then reexpresses the result in the original basis using a set of local rules .",
    "these allow to arbitrarily add and remove edges with the trivial label  @xmath18 in addition to isotopic deformations that keep the leaves fixed , @xmath28-moves as in  , substitutions of bubbles by scalars as specified by @xmath42 and resolution of crossings using the @xmath43-matrix .",
    "the latter take the form @xmath44    the space @xmath45 has dimension @xmath46 .",
    "it is invariant under the action the purebraid group  @xmath47 on @xmath17  strands .",
    "this is the subgroup of the braid group  @xmath31 where each strand begins and ends in the same position .",
    "the restriction of this group action to  @xmath20 has a dense image in the unitary group  @xmath48 modulo global phase factors  @xcite ( i.e. , is computationally universal ) .",
    "more precisely , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the subgroup of @xmath51 generated by @xmath52 .",
    "let us identify physically relevant states .",
    "we envision the dots to be arranged in spatially separated pairs , see fig .",
    "[ fig : anyonarrangement ] .",
    "@xmath53    let @xmath54 be the ( up to a phase ) unique state of no particles .",
    "we could imagine the system to be initially prepared in this vacuum state , but subsequently undergo processes which create particle - antiparticle pairs locally at pairs of dots .",
    "we expect tunneling of ( topological ) charges between different pairs to be exponentially suppressed in the inter - pair distance ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . due to the geometric arrangement of the dots",
    ", the resulting state will therefore essentially be a mixture of superpositions with trivial charge for each pair of dots , but having @xmath55-pairs within some of them .",
    "it is natural to ask for the distribution of @xmath55-pairs in such a state . here",
    "we will make the minimal assumption that within region  @xmath56 containing @xmath57  pairs of dots , there is a non - zero number of @xmath55-pairs except with a probability exponentially small in  @xmath57 .",
    "more precisely , let  @xmath58 denote the projection onto the subspace spanned by states where all pairs in @xmath56 have trivial total topological charge and at least one @xmath55-pair is present .",
    "we assume that the states are supported on the image of @xmath58 up to a fraction exponentially small in  @xmath57 .",
    "states of this form are the starting point for our braiding procedure .    as a prototypical example of a state satisfying our assumptions ,",
    "suppose @xmath59 is the result of a process @xmath60 which creates particle pairs with probability  @xmath61 locally",
    ". then the number of pairs in a region  @xmath56 is binomially distributed with parameters @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "we will assume that after the initial pair creation processes , the dots are moved apart from each other so that further particle tunneling is suppressed .",
    "we will show how states satisfying our assumptions can be efficiently mapped to a subspace @xmath3 ( up to a negligible error ) by braiding , where @xmath64 is the state of @xmath65  composite @xmath55-pairs each with trivial topological charge .",
    "the latter can be identified with the state  @xmath66 of  @xmath67  logical qubits in a standard encoding .",
    "we conclude this section by commenting on the physical systems where our scheme may be applicable . because of the restricted repertoire of currently realizable operations in the fqhe setting , the proposed procedure may be more useful in the lattice hamiltonian setting ( if such a system can be realized ) .",
    "furthermore , in quantum hall states , anyons typically carry additional quantum numbers such as electric charge .",
    "this should simplify their detection by local measurements ; it also leads to an additional energetic cost for having anyon pairs .",
    "in contrast , anyons encoded in the ground space of a lattice system ( as in  @xcite ) have degenerate energies even for different topological charges .",
    "also , these anyons are not naturally localized , but correspond to topologically non - trivial loops around holes . to measure these topological charges requires non - local measurements which are susceptible to noise .",
    "thus such lattice systems are natural candidates for the application of the proposed scheme .      for simplicity , we first consider the problem of `` distilling '' a single composite @xmath55-pair , i.e. , @xmath68 , and generalize to @xmath69 later .",
    "we show the following : consider a region @xmath70 partitioned into disjoint sets @xmath71 each containing @xmath72 pairs of dots .",
    "then there is an efficiently computable sequence of @xmath73 elementary braiding operations within  @xmath56 with the following effect : the image @xmath74 of any state @xmath75 can be approximated in trace norm to distance  @xmath76 by a superposition of states with a composite @xmath55-pair between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "pictorially , @xmath79 where the notation @xmath80 indicates that the result is approximate up to an error  @xmath76 in trace norm .",
    "this picture is to be understood in a basis where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the leaves of two subtrees joined together . in other words ,",
    "the resulting state is supported on the subspace @xmath81 , where the code space @xmath82 is the space of @xmath83  composite @xmath15-anyons defined by the subregions @xmath71 , and the space  @xmath2 corresponds to the internal degrees of freedom in the subregions ( represented by boxes ) .",
    "elementary braiding operations are defined as clockwise or counterclockwise exchanges of regions contained within @xmath56 , and thus have a polynomial complexity in the length of the boundary of  @xmath56 .    to establish our main claim ,",
    "consider the special case where @xmath84 , i.e. , @xmath77 and @xmath78 each contain a pair of dots . here",
    "the subspace @xmath85 is spanned by states which locally have the form of the three states @xmath86 our goal is to map such states to states of the form @xmath87 by an appropriate braid of the dots . by the density result mentioned above ( applied to the space @xmath88 )",
    ", there is an element  @xmath89 which approximately maps @xmath90 up to an irrelevant phase . using the fact that @xmath40  is a purebraid ,",
    "we conclude that the other two states are mapped to themselves up to phase factors , i.e. , @xmath91 note that , by the kitaev - solovay theorem  @xcite , a sequence of @xmath92 ( where @xmath93 is a constant and @xmath94 ) generators implementing a braid  @xmath40 with the desired property can be found efficiently . executing this sequence",
    "is the first step in our procedure .",
    "it remains to map the two states in   to states of the form  , _ while leaving the rhs .  of   invariant_. for this purpose ,",
    "we use the _ injection weave _ construction proposed in  @xcite .",
    "this is an element @xmath95 with the following properties : ( i )  up to an error  @xmath76 , it acts as the identity on the space of three @xmath15-anyons , ( ii )  it is a _ weave _ ,",
    "i.e. , only a single strand , the _ warp_-strand is moved around  @xmath83 stationary strands and ( iii )  the warp strand starts in the right - most position , and is transferred to the leftmost position . fig .",
    "[ fig : injectionweave ] shows the form , i.e. , conditions ( ii ) and ( iii ) defining such a braid . as for the braid  @xmath40 ,",
    "an injection weave  @xmath96 of length  @xmath97 can be found efficiently using the kitaev - solovay algorithm  ( see  @xcite for a general discussion of the existence of injection weaves and its application to the construction of `` pureweaves '' for universal computation ) .",
    "it is clear that applying such an element  @xmath96 to the three rightmost strands maps @xmath98 for some phases @xmath99 , while approximately preserving the state on the rhs .  of   up to an error  @xmath76 by property  ( i ) .",
    "importantly , the precision  @xmath76 of @xmath40 and @xmath96 can be improved exponentially by a polynomial increase in the length of the braids .",
    "we conclude that the composition @xmath100 achieves the desired result in the case where @xmath84 .",
    "to prove our claim in the general case , consider a region  @xmath56 containing @xmath101  pairs of dots .",
    "we divide these into groups of @xmath102  dots ( two pairs ) , and apply @xmath100 to each of these groups . picking an area around each pair , we can think of the result in terms of `` superdots '' ( each containing a pair ) where composite @xmath15-anyons may reside . inspecting the previous analysis",
    ", we conclude that by going from dots to composite objects , we half the number of objects , while effectively increasing the density of @xmath55-pairs .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath103 be defined in the same way as  @xmath58 , but for the @xmath104  pairs of superdots .",
    "then the map @xmath105 takes @xmath106 and is composed of @xmath107 elementary braiding operations .",
    "here we used the triangle inequality to give an upper bound on the error .",
    "finally , we use this procedure recursively : at the @xmath108-th level ( with @xmath108 decreasing from @xmath109 to @xmath18 ) , we divide the given @xmath110  regions into groups of four , apply @xmath111 and obtain @xmath112  superregions containing pairs of regions .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit ] ( cf .",
    "[ fig : anyonarrangement ] ) .",
    "we are interested in composite @xmath55-pairs among pairs of these superregions ( at most  @xmath113 may be present ) , and define  @xmath114 accordingly . by induction using  ,",
    "we conclude that after @xmath115 steps , we obtain a map @xmath116 furthermore , this requires @xmath117 elementary braiding operations .",
    "we conclude that any desired precision @xmath118 can be obtained with @xmath119 elementary braiding operations .",
    "furthermore , by definition of  @xmath120 , the resulting state has a ( composite ) @xmath55-anyon between two regions of  @xmath56 having  @xmath121  points each .",
    "we have thus established our main claim for @xmath68 encoded @xmath55-pair .",
    "let us now generalize this result to the generation of @xmath69 composite @xmath55-pairs . since the transformation   does not affect the region outside @xmath56 , we can simply repeat it @xmath65  times .",
    "that is , we fix a partition @xmath122 of the system into sufficiently large regions  @xmath123 , each containing  @xmath124 pairs of dots  ( @xmath124  is a power of @xmath83 ) . as argued above , the space @xmath125 , which is the space of states having at least one @xmath55-pair in each region , essentially supports all states of interest . applying the transformation   for each @xmath126 maps any such state into a state of @xmath65  encoded @xmath55-pairs with error at most @xmath127 ,",
    "i.e. , ( for  @xmath12 ) @xmath128 the code space  @xmath129 is the space of @xmath130  composite @xmath15-anyons defined by subregions @xmath131 , where we have chosen a bipartition @xmath132 for each @xmath133 with @xmath134 .",
    "the space  @xmath2 represents the internal degrees of freedom in the subregions .",
    "note that the resulting state can be used to represent the state @xmath66 of @xmath67  logical qubits in a `` computational '' subspace @xmath135 using a standard encoding  @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "our braiding sequence is efficiently computable and creates @xmath65  composite @xmath55-pairs from any state supported on  @xmath136 .",
    "any desired precision  @xmath76 is obtained using a polynomial number  @xmath137 of elementary braiding operations .",
    "the latter are defined as clockwise or counterclockwise exchanges of regions contained within the sets  @xmath123 , and thus have a polynomial complexity in the length of the boundary of  @xmath123 .",
    "we have demonstrated that using composite anyons in conjunction with specific braiding sequences can eliminate the need for preparing a particular initial state for topological quantum computation .",
    "our scheme is highly parallelizable , and bears a remarkable similarity with entanglement renormalization methods  @xcite , suggesting that these concepts might extend to the setting of anyons .",
    "our work is merely a proof of principle and is restricted to fibonacci anyons , though our arguments can be adapted to give procedures for the anyons of @xmath138  chern - simons - witten theory along the lines of  @xcite , as well as to e.g. , the doubled fibonacci theory . whether or not similar schemes can be constructed for more general anyon models is an interesting open problem which goes beyond commonly considered universality questions .",
    "computational universality allows to implement not - type gates using pure - braids , and also gives rise to injection weaves  @xcite , but this is not necessarily sufficient to provide a distillation scheme along the lines explained here .",
    "another challenging problem is the examination of the robustness of the scheme with respect to different initial states having composite topological charge . in practice",
