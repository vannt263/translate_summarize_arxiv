    "<S> @xmath118 in is an active tension @xcite , arising , for example , via an interplay of the active polymerization and the polar anchoring modelled by the free - energy cost @xmath119 in . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling generates a term of the form @xmath120 in the @xmath100 equation and , therefore , because of propulsion , an effective tension in the @xmath79 equation . </S>",
    "<S> was obtained by projecting onto the reference horizontal , with @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> the term with coefficient @xmath122 arises from the frank elasticity of the polar filaments . </S>",
    "<S> note the absence of a term proportional to @xmath123 in , a consequence of three - dimensional rotation invariance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the propulsive velocity @xmath91 in is taken to depend only on @xmath14 as @xmath11 has been set to a constant value . </S>",
    "<S> we turn next to some original instability mechanisms emerging from .    </S>",
    "<S> first consider the case of large positive @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath112 is then deep in the isotropic phase , and can thus be eliminated in favour of @xmath79 and @xmath14 on timescales long compared to its finite relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting equations are then those of @xcite , with a modified diffusivity @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> the complete problem , including the dynamics of @xmath112 , is characterized by two eigenmodes with relaxation rates @xmath126 and two of order @xmath127 , unaffected to leading order in @xmath128 by the coupling @xmath129 in the @xmath112 equation . </S>",
    "<S> a large enough negative @xmath42 leads to an instability with aggregation of @xmath14 and modulation of @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this picture is borne out by a linear stability analysis in which the dynamics of @xmath112 is retained @xcite , revealing an eigenvalue of order @xmath130 that changes sign for sufficiently large negative @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> the projection of the corresponding eigenvector onto @xmath79 grows with increasing @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying process involves the focusing of @xmath132 and hence the concentration , leading , through the @xmath133 term in , to growth of the height field . whether the focusing of @xmath112 takes the form of asters or walls , leading respectively to height modulations in the form of tubules or ridges , requires a numerical calculation . </S>",
    "<S> if both @xmath124 and @xmath42 are negative , an extrapolation of the results of @xcite would suggest the formation of ordered modulations of @xmath79 .    in flocking models </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , just past the onset of the ordered phase of @xmath134 , the coupled dynamics of @xmath14 and @xmath112 gives rise , through the @xmath14 dependence of @xmath124 , to a state with travelling bands of concentration @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . in the present context where the dynamics takes place on a membrane this should be accompanied , through @xmath133 in , by a one - dimensional fore - aft asymmetric modulation of the membrane height .    </S>",
    "<S> the coupled dynamics of @xmath134 and @xmath79 with @xmath14 fixed shows a distinct class of modes and instabilities deep in the regime where @xmath112 is ordered . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath135 there is a travelling instability with relaxation rate of transverse fluctuations @xmath136 , if the ordering direction is taken along @xmath1 . as @xmath99 </S>",
    "<S> is increased this crosses over to @xmath137 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note , despite the similarity of form with the mode structure of @xcite , that the detailed mechanisms are different .    to summarize : we have shown that the equations of motion for an active membrane @xcite emerge from the dynamics of an ordinary fluid membrane coupled to a medium with active , motile filaments . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the resulting equations display spontaneous sustained oscillations driven by the active motion of the membrane normal to itself which are the natural explanation of membrane waves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , when polar  horizontal filaments \" @xcite are included , the coupled dynamics of their concentration and orientation and the membrane height leads to instabilities towards one- or two - dimensional modulations , as well as travelling undulations . </S>",
    "<S> deep in the orientationally ordered phase of the filaments we find propagating instabilities with singularly anisotropic dependence on wavevector . </S>",
    "<S> ongoing numerical studies of the long - time dynamics emerging from these instabilities find a varied range of behaviors including stable tubules and spatiotemporal chaos @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , we look forward to tests of our predictions in actomyosin extracts with atp and actin nucleators in contact with model lipid membranes .    </S>",
