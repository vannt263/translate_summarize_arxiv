    "to uncover formation mechanisms of diverse exoplanetary systems , the ( mis)alignment between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar spin axis , which can be measured via the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect ( e.g. , @xcite ) or spot - crossing events ( e.g. , @xcite ) , has been recognized as an useful clue .",
    "previous observations have revealed that about one third of hot jupiters have tilted or even retrograde orbits relative to their host star s spin ( e.g. , ) .",
    "this indicates that not only disk - planet interaction but also few - body interaction ( planet - planet scattering and/or the kozai mechanism ) play an important role in planetary migration processes . moreover , some studies pointed out the interesting facts that spin - orbit misalignments in planetary orbits are apparently correlated with host star s temperature @xcite and age , while these correlations can be explained by the properties and evolution of the internal structure in host stars @xcite .",
    "those correlations are important clues to understand the whole picture of planetary migration .",
    "however , previous discussions often overlooked the possible presence of faint distant companions . in most of the rm measurements , except for some obvious cases ( e.g. , xo-2 , hd80606 )",
    ", observers did not check whether the host star has outer companions .",
    "thus any correlation between the spin - orbit misalignment and the existence of binary companions has not been well investigated . to solve this problem ,",
    "we have started high - contrast direct imaging observations for known transiting planetary systems in the course of the seeds ( strategic explorations of exoplanets and disks with subaru ; @xcite ) project .",
    "@xcite reported two candidate companions around hat - p-7 , which was known to have a retrograde hot jupiter hat - p-7b @xcite . in this letter , we present evidence that one of the two candidate companions is indeed a true companion of hat - p-7 , confirmed by the common proper motion and the distance from earth inferred from its spectral type and apparent magnitude .",

    "for high - contrast direct imaging , we employed ircs ( for @xmath13 , @xmath17 , @xmath20 bands ) and hiciao ( for @xmath1 band ) with ao188 @xcite on the subaru 8.2 m telescope .",
    "our observation logs ( observing dates , instruments , filters , exposure times ) and properties of the candidate companions are summarized in tables  1  and  2 .",
    "magnitudes of the bright companion are derived by relative photometry with the host star using unsaturated images , and then magnitudes of the faint companion are similarly derived by relative photometry with the bright companion using saturated images .",
    "figure  1 shows pictures of hat - p-7 in different epochs and bands .",
    "figure  2 plots time changes of positions of the candidate companions . based on the tycho-2 catalogue",
    ", hat - p-7 has a proper motion of @xmath43 mas / yr in right ascension ( ra ) and @xmath44 mas / yr in declination ( dec ) . from figure  2",
    ", we find that the motion of the western ( fainter ) candidate is consistent with a background star ( @xmath45 for a degree of freedom of 6 ) , while the motion of the eastern ( brighter ) candidate is different from a background star ( @xmath46 for a degree of freedom of 6 ) and consistent with a common proper motion with hat - p-7 .",
    "in addition to the common proper motion , the spectral type of the eastern candidate supports a consistent distance with hat - p-7 , as follows .",
    "the distance to hat - p-7 was estimated as @xmath47 pc by @xcite , based on the yonsei - yale stellar evolution models @xcite and sme ( spectroscopy made easy : ) analysis .",
    "on the other hand , using the available colors ( @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath13 , @xmath1 , @xmath17 ) , we confirm that the eastern companion is an m5.5v dwarf ( see figure  3 ) . based on the absolute magnitude of an m5.5v dwarf in @xmath1 band @xcite",
    ", we estimate a distance modulus of @xmath48 , which corresponds to @xmath49 pc .",
    "thus the spectro - photometric distance to the eastern companion is in good agreement with the distance to hat - p-7 from earth .",
    "we thus conclude that hat - p-7 has a common proper motion stellar ( m5.5v ) companion at a projected separation of @xmath0 arcsec ( @xmath50  au ) .",
    "note that assuming a random distribution for the companion orbit , the expected unprojected separation is @xmath51 times larger than the projected separation ( see also table  6 of @xcite for a conversion factor from the projected separation to the semi - major axis ) .",
    "here we name the eastern companion as `` hat - p-7b '' ( hereafter , just `` b '' ) .",
    "( 75mm,75mm)fig3.eps    ( 85mm,85mm)fig4.eps",
    "@xcite reported the possible existence of a third ( different from hat - p-7b and hat - p-7b ) companion from a long - term radial velocity ( rv ) trend observed with the keck hires between 2007 and 2009 .",
    "we confirm the long - term trend based on rvs measured with the subaru hds in 2008 and 2010 ( the rvs are available upon request ) .",
    "figure  4 shows the rvs taken with the subaru hds and residuals from the best - fit one - planet model with and without a long - term linear rv trend @xmath52 ( see @xcite , for the fitting procedure ) .",
    "we find @xmath53  m  s@xmath54  yr@xmath54 , which agrees well with @xcite ( @xmath55  m  s@xmath54  yr@xmath54 ) .",
    "note that `` b '' can not explain the observed long - term rv trend .",
    "thus we conclude that there is the third companion in this system . here",
    "we name the long - term rv companion as `` hat - p-7c '' ( hereafter , just `` c '' ) .",
    "the trend corresponds to the mass constraint of `` c '' as , @xmath56 the orbital period of `` c '' is presumably longer than 10  yr , since the trend is still approximately linear .",
    "thus `` c '' is likely to be more massive than jupiter .",
    "we do not detect `` c '' in high - contrast direct images , because it is too close to the host star .",
    "@xcite pointed out that hat - p-7b ( hereafter , just `` b '' ) can not be migrated by the kozai mechanism caused by `` b '' in the presence of `` c '' in the system .",
    "however , they also pointed out that there is another possibility of `` sequential '' kozai migration ( see e.g. , @xcite ) in this system .",
    "namely , an inclined outer stellar companion `` b '' causes the kozai mechanism for the outer `` c '' first , and then the inclined `` c '' induces the kozai mechanism for the inner `` b '' . such an initial inclined configuration can be formed by planet - planet scattering of `` b '' and `` c '' ( and other possible undetected massive planets )",
    "recently , @xcite pointed out the interesting fact that the spin - orbit alignment timescale of hat - p-7 due to the tidal effect is much shorter than the star s age ( see figure  25 of @xcite ) .",
    "namely , the retrograde orbit of hat - p-7b appears to be a strong outlier which should be aligned at the age of hat - p-7 .",
    "however , they did not consider the existence of the outer companions `` b '' and `` c '' .",
    "here we propose an alternative reason of the outlier : if the kozai oscillation of `` b '' caused by `` c '' had once happened , the tidal timescale for spin - orbit alignment can be much longer . based on equation ( 1 ) and the timescale of the kozai oscillation as , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the host star s mass , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are the mass , orbital period , and eccentricity of `` c '' , and @xmath62 is the orbital period of `` b '' @xcite , we estimate that the timescale of kozai oscillation of `` b '' caused by `` c '' is comparable to the age of hat - p-7 ( @xmath63  gyr ) .",
    "thus a possible slowly - changing orbital inclination due to the kozai oscillation might have prevented hat - p-7b from achieving a spin - orbit alignment .",
    "we note that , however , the above discussion may be still optimistic , as the kozai oscillation is easily suppressed by other effects such as general relativity , tides , stellar distortion , or extra bodies ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . at the current position of `` b '' , the timescale of general relativity is indeed shorter than the timescale of kozai oscillation of `` b '' caused by `` c '' .",
    "this means the kozai oscillation does not extend the timescale of spin - orbit alignment any more , although it might have once happened .",
    "we thus note that we may still overlook other special conditions that inhibit the spin - orbit alignment in this system .",
    "thus far , the existence of possible faint outer companions around planetary systems has not been checked and is often overlooked , even though the kozai migration models assume the presence of an outer companion . to further discuss planetary migration using the information of the rm effect / spot - crossing events as well as significant orbital eccentricities ,",
    "it is important to incorporate information regarding the possible or known existence of binary companions .",
    "this is also because a large fraction of the stars in the universe form binary systems @xcite .",
    "thus it would be important to check the presence of faint binary companions by high - contrast direct imaging .",
    "in addition , if any outer binary companion is found , it is also necessary to consider the possibility of sequential kozai migration in the system , since planet - planet scattering , if it occurs , is likely to form the initial condition of such planetary migration .",
    "we present evidence that hat - p-7 has a common proper motion stellar companion by high - contrast direct imaging with subaru hiciao and ircs .",
    "the companion is located at @xmath0 arcsec to the east and estimated as an m5.5v star based on its colors .",
    "we also confirm the presence of the third companion hat - p-7c by rv measurements with the subaru hds .",
    "our finding that hat - p-7 is a wide binary system increase the potential that the sequential kozai migration had once occured in this system .",
    "this scenario may be favorable to explain the discrepancy between the spin - orbit alignment timescale for hat - p-7b and the stellar age noted by @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", a number of rm and spot - crossing observations have provided useful information on the spin - orbit ( mis)alignment , which is an important clue to understand the variety of planetary migration mechanisms .",
    "the same holds for eccentric planetary systems , since the eccentricity is another important clue to discuss planetary migration by few - body interactions .",
    "we thus propose that high - contrast direct imaging observations should be made for known planetary systems to check the presence of outer faint companions .",
    "since the dependence of the spin - orbit ( mis)alignment or significant eccentricity on the existence of outer companions is still unclear , it is important to conduct such observations to understand the entire picture of planetary migration .",
