    "the quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) @xcite predicts that matter changes its phase at high temperature and density and bound ( colorless ) hadrons dissolve to interacting ( colored ) quarks and gluons , i.e. to the quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "such extreme conditions have existed in the early expansion of the universe and now can be realized in the laboratory by collisions of heavy - ions at ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "the study of the phase boundary and the properties of the qgp are the main goal of several present and future heavy - ion experiments at sps ( super proton synchrotron ) , rhic ( relativistic heavy - ion collider ) , lhc ( large hadron collider ) and the future fair ( facility for antiproton and ion research ) and nica ( nuclotron - based ion collider facility ) @xcite .",
    "since the qgp is created only for a short time ( of a couple of fm / c ) it is quite challenging to study its properties and to find the most sensible probes .",
    "the advantage of hard probes such as mesons containing heavy quarks ( charm and beauty ) is , firstly , that due to the heavy masses they are dominantly produced in the very early stages of the reactions with large energy - momentum transfer , contrary to the light hadrons and electromagnetic probes .",
    "secondly , they are not in an equilibrium with the surrounding matter due to smaller interaction cross sections relative to the light quarks and , thus , may provide an information on their creation mechanisms .",
    "moreover , due to the hard scale , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) should be applicable for the calculation of heavy quark production . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fonll calculations are in good agreement with the experimental observables on charm meson spectra in p+p collisions .",
    "this provides a solid reference frame for studying the heavy - meson production and their flow pattern in heavy - ion collisions .    the first charm measurements at rhic energies by the phenix@xcite and star @xcite collaborations were related to the single non - photonic electrons emitted from the decay of charm mesons .",
    "however , recently the star collaboration measured directly the nuclear modification factor and the elliptic flow of @xmath3 mesons in au+au collisions at @xmath6200 gev  @xcite which allows for a straightforward comparison with the theoretical model calculations . it has been observed that the @xmath7 and @xmath2 of charm mesons show a similar behavior as in case of light hadrons contrary to expectations from pqcd .",
    "similar observations have been made at lhc energies , too @xcite .",
    "it still remains a challenge for the theory to reproduce the experimental data and to explain simultaneously the large energy loss of charm quarks ( @xmath7 ) and the strong collectivity ( @xmath2 ) ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "commonly , the interactions of charm quarks with the partonic medium are based on pqcd with massless light quarks and a fixed or running coupling . however , lattice qcd and quasiparticle approaches lead to the notion of massive degrees - of - freedom with finite spectral width @xcite . in this case",
    "the pqcd cross sections are no longer meaningful . moreover ,",
    "the conclusions on the amount of suppression due to collisional energy loss by means of the elastic interactions of charm quarks with the qgp partons versus the radiative energy loss due to the emission of soft gluons ( i.e. gluon bremsstrahlung ) are still far from being robust",
    ". also the influence of hadronization and especially hadronic rescattering is not yet settled , too .",
    "our goal here is to study the charm dynamics based on a consistent microscopic transport approach for the charm production , hadronization and rescattering with the partonic and hadronic medium . in this study",
    "we will confront our calculations within the parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) approach to the experimental data on charm at rhic and lhc energies and discuss the perspectives / problems of using the charm quarks for the tomography of the qgp . to achieve this goal we embed the heavy - quark physics in the existing phsd transport approach @xcite which incorporates explicit partonic degrees - of - freedom in terms of strongly interacting quasiparticles ( quarks and gluons ) in line with an equation - of - state from lattice qcd ( lqcd ) as well as dynamical hadronization and hadronic elastic and inelastic collisions in the final reaction phase .",
    "since phsd has been successfully applied to describe the final distribution of mesons ( with light quark content ) from lower sps up to lhc energies @xcite , it provides a solid framework for the description of the creation , expansion and hadronization of the qgp as well as the hadronic expansion with which the heavy quarks interact either as quarks or as bound states such as @xmath0-mesons .",
    "we note in passing that in the hadronic phase phsd merges with the familiar hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd ) approach @xcite .",
    "before studying the charm production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , we discuss the charm production in p+p collisions at the top rhic energy of @xmath8 = 200 gev .",
    "the charm production in p+p collisions also plays the role as a reference for the nuclear modification factor @xmath7 in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we use the pythia event generator to produce charm and anticharm quarks in p+p collisions with the parameters parp(91)=1.0 gev / c and parp(67)=1.0 as in ref .",
    "the former parameter is the gaussian width of the primordial transverse momentum of a parton which initiates a shower in hadrons and the latter the parton shower level parameter .",
    "we note that by an additional suppression of the transverse momenta of charm and anticharm quarks by 10 % and a suppression of rapidities by 16 % the transverse momentum spectrum as well as rapidity distribution of charm and anticharm quarks from the pythia event generator are very similar to those from the fonll calculations in p+p collisions at @xmath9200 gev as shown in fig .",

    "we can see that our results reproduce the experimental data from the star collaboration @xcite reasonably well .",
    "since charm - quark production requires a high energy - momentum transfer , the number of produced charm quark pairs in relativistic heavy - ion collisions is proportional to the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath15 . since the probability to produce a charm quark pair depends on invariant energy and is less than that for primary hard collision in the phsd , the binary nucleon - nucleon collisions producing charm quark pairs in phsd are chosen by monte carlo from the ratio of the cross section for charm production in nucleon - nucleon collisions , @xmath16 , to the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "the actual charm cross section @xmath16 ( red solid line ) is shown in fig . 1 ( r.h.s . ) in comparison to the experimental data from @xcite .",
    "quarks , antiquarks , and gluons are dressed in the qgp and have temperature - dependent effective masses and widths . in the dqpm , the mass and width of the light partons are given by thermal quantum - field theory assuming leading order diagrams but the strong coupling @xmath17 is fitted to lattice data on energy and entropy densities , etc .",
    "note that a nonzero width of a parton reflects the off - shell nature as well as the strong interaction of the quasi - particle and finite life - time .",
    "the charm and anticharm quarks produced in early hard collisions interact with the dressed off - shell partons in the qgp .",
    "the cross sections for the charm quark scattering with massive off - shell partons are calculated considering the mass spectra of final state particles  @xcite . in the current study",
    "the charm quark mass is taken to be 1.5 gev and its mass spectrum is neglected for simplicity .    in the present study",
    "we consider only elastic scattering of charm quarks by light quarks and gluons .",
    "we do not consider yet the radiative processes which generate radiative energy loss because we expect that , due to the large gluon mass in the dqpm , the radiative processes are sub - dominant as compared to the collisional ones , especially for low charm - quark momenta @xmath18 .",
    "we expect the radiative energy loss to contribute at very high @xmath5 as accessible experimentally at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the transport coefficient @xmath19 for charm quark diffusion  extracted from our microscopic calculations  and its agreement with the lqcd results ( within errors ) and the corresponding @xmath0 meson @xmath19 in hadronic medium validate our description for the coupling of charm with the qgp matter @xcite .",
    "since the hot and dense matter created by a relativistic heavy - ion collision expands with time , the energy density of the matter decreases and the deconfined degrees - of - freedom hadronize to color neutral hadronic states .",
    "once the local energy density in phsd becomes lower than 0.5 @xmath20 , the partons are hadronized .",
    "first we look for all combinations of a charm quark and light antiquarks or of an anticharm quark and a light quark and calculate the probability for each combination to form a @xmath0 or @xmath10 ( or @xmath21 ) meson .",
    "the probability for a quark and an anti - quark to form a meson is given by @xmath22 , \\label{meson}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the degeneracy of the meson @xmath24 , and @xmath25 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the mass , position and momentum of the quark or antiquark @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the width parameter @xmath30 is related to the root - mean - square radius of the meson produced through @xmath31 and thus determined by experiment ( if available ) .",
    "however , we will use this radius as a free parameter and evaluate the coalescence for a @xmath0-meson radius of 0.5 and 0.9 fm ( see below ) .",
    "for further details we refer the reader to @xcite .    collecting all possible combinations of a charm or an anticharm quark with light quarks or antiquarks and calculating the coalescence probability for each combination from eq .",
    "( [ meson ] ) , we obtain the probability for the charm or the anticharm quark to hadronize by coalescence in the actual space - time volume @xmath32 .",
    "whether the charm or the anticharm quark is actually hadronized by coalescence is decided by monte carlo .",
    "once the charm or the anticharm quark is decided to be hadronized by coalescence , then we find its partner again by monte carlo on the basis on the probability of each combination in the selected local ensemble . in case the charm or anticharm quark",
    "is decided not to hadronize by coalescence , it is hadronized by the fragmentation method as in p+p collisions ( cf .",
    "section 2.1 ) .",
    "since the hadronization by coalescence is absent in p+p collisions , it can be interpreted as a nuclear matter effect on the hadronization of charm and anticharm quarks .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath10 mesons produced through coalescence or fragmentation interact with the surrounding hadrons in phsd .",
    "the presence of several resonances close to threshold energies with dominant decay modes involving open - charm mesons and light hadrons suggests that the scattering cross sections of a @xmath33 off a meson or baryon , highly abundant in the post - hadronization medium , could manifest a non - trivial energy , isospin and flavor dependence .",
    "an example of these states is the broad scalar resonance @xmath34 , which decays into the pseudoscalar ground state @xmath0 by emitting a pion in the @xmath35-wave ( similarly to the heavy - quark spin partner @xmath36 , decaying into @xmath37 ) .",
    "moreover , the similarity between the @xmath38 and the @xmath39 has driven the attention to the fact that the latter could be playing the role of a sub - threshold resonance in the @xmath40 system , connected to the latter by coupled - channel dynamics .",
    "all these features have been addressed within several recent approaches based on hadronic effective models which incorporate chiral symmetry breaking in the light sector .",
    "the additional freedom stemming from the coupling to heavy - flavored mesons is constrained by imposing heavy - quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) . whereas chiral symmetry fully determines the scattering amplitudes of goldstone bosons with other hadrons at leading order in a model independent way , by means of hqss the dynamics of the pseudoscalar and the vector mesons containing heavy quarks",
    "can be connected , since all kinds of spin interactions are suppressed in the limit of infinite quark masses @xcite .",
    "for further details we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite and the original literature cited therein .",
    "we now turn to actual nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic and lhc energies . here",
    "the nuclear modification of @xmath0 mesons is expressed in term of the ratio @xmath7 which is defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are , respectively , the number of @xmath0 mesons produced in au+au collisions and that in p+p collisions , and @xmath44 is the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions in au+au ( pb+pb ) collisions for the centrality class considered . if the matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions does not modify the @xmath0 meson production and propagation , the numerator of eq .",
