    "the @xmath0 meson discovered by the cdf collaboration @xcite in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath5 tev completes the family of mixed flavor mesons .",
    "the @xmath0 meson has a @xmath6 anti - quark and a @xmath7 quark .",
    "current and future experiments at the tevatron and lhc are expected to provide large samples of the excited states of the @xmath0 mesons @xcite .",
    "this will make possible the study of the spectroscopy and the decays of the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the @xmath0 meson family lies intermediate in mass and size between the @xmath8 @xmath9 and the @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) families where the heavy quark interactions are believed to be understood rather well .",
    "comparison between experimental measurement and theoretical results will improve our understanding of these interactions and guide us in the search for multiquark and molecular exotics such as the recently claimed ( discovered ) @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "different models @xcite including various versions of potential models and qcd sum rules have been used to evaluate the @xmath0 spectrum yielding results consistent with the experimentally measured ground state mass and lifetime .",
    "the @xmath0 mesons have non - vanishing flavor quantum numbers which are conserved in strong and electromagnetic interactions . therefore , the @xmath0 states , below the open flavor @xmath1 threshold , can only decay weakly or radiatively .",
    "these states are expected to be relatively long - lived and easier to be observed experimentally . from the theoretical side , weak and radiative decays are free from uncertainties encountered in strong decays which makes the decays of these states theoretically more tractable .    in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we have evaluated a limited set of the @xmath0 spectrum using a model based on reductions of the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) .",
    "we have used a set of parameters fixed from previous investigations of other meson spectra .",
    "our results agreed very well with the experimentally measured ground state mass and lifetime .",
    "we also evaluated the @xmath0 decay constant , the @xmath6 antiquark and the @xmath7 quark inclusive decay widths and the weak annihilation width .",
    "we also evaluated the exclusive semileptonic ( @xmath14 ) and two - body nonleptonic ( @xmath15 ) decay widths @xcite , where p ( v ) denotes a pseudoscalar ( vector ) meson .",
    "we used the bse amplitudes to evaluate the semileptonic form factors and used factorization to obtain the nonleptonic decay widths in terms of the semileptonic form factors and the weak decay constants .    in the present paper , we evaluate the complete @xmath0 spectrum below the open flavor @xmath1 threshold and consider the radiative @xmath16 and @xmath17 electromagnetic transitions .",
    "this complements our picture @xcite of the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "radiative decays are the dominant decay modes of the @xmath0 excited states having widths of about a fraction of mev , much greater than the weak widths at the order of mev . therefore , accurate determination of the masses and the radiative decay widths will be extremely important for understanding the @xmath0 spectrum and distinguishing exotic states .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly outline our model and compare our spectrum with those of other models .",
    "we then evaluate the @xmath16 and @xmath17 radiative decays .",
    "finally we discuss our results .",
    "we applied a relativistic model based on reductions of the bse to evaluate the @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "the bse is a suitable starting point for treating hadrons as relativistic bound states of quarks and antiquarks , just as the dirac equation provides a relativistic description of a fermion in an external field .",
    "the bse for a bound state may be written in momentum space in the form @xcite    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the four - momentum of the bound state , @xmath20 is the relative four - momentum of the constituents .",
    "the bse has three elements , the two particle propagator ( @xmath21 ) and the interaction kernel ( @xmath22 ) which we provide as input , and the amplitude ( @xmath23 ) obtained by solving the equation .",
    "we also solve for the energy , which is contained in the propagator .",
    "we used a reduction of the bse where the two particle propagator is modified in a way that keeps covariance and reduces the four - dimensional bse into a three - dimensional equation @xcite .",
    "we considered an interactional kernel that consists of two terms , one for the short range one gluon exchange @xmath24 and the other for the long range phenomenological confinement interaction @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "@xmath26    here , @xmath27 is the strong coupling , which is weighted by the meson color factor of @xmath28 , and the string tension @xmath29 is the strength of the confining part of the interaction . while the one gluon exchange @xmath24 has the vector nature , we adopt a scalar lorentz structure for @xmath25 as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we solve for the energies and the amplitudes in momentum space and transform these amplitudes into coordinate space .",
    "we have included seven parameters in our model , four masses ( @xmath30 ) , two parameters to fix the strong coupling @xmath27 and control its running with the meson mass , and the last parameter is the string tension @xmath29 of the confining interaction .",
    "we fixed the parameters of our model by fitting the spectra of other mesons as described in @xcite .",
    "we obtained a good fit for a wide range of meson masses with root mean square deviation from experimental masses of about 50 mev .",
    "table [ parameters ] compares the parameters relevant to the @xmath0 mesons of our model with those of different models in the literature . in table",
    "[ parameters ] , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the masses of the @xmath7 and @xmath33 quark respectively , while @xmath27 is the strong coupling of the one gluon exchange and @xmath29 is the string tension of the confining interaction . in many models , including ours , @xmath27 runs with the meson mass , thus table [ parameters ] gives @xmath27 at the scale of the ground state mass of the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the model used in @xcite employs the martin potential @xcite which is not linear but varies with powers of the quark antiquark distance .",
    "we notice that our @xmath31 and @xmath32 values are smaller that those of other models , while our string tension @xmath29 is larger .",
    "the values of the strong coupling @xmath27 are consistent around 0.36 except in @xcite where @xmath27 is 0.265 and in @xcite where @xmath27 is 0.21 .",
    ".[parameters]the parameters of different models relevant to the @xmath0 mesons . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    table [ m1 ] shows differences between the transition energies ( spin - spin splittings ) , while the transition matrix elements are comparable .",
    "it also shows that hindered transitions have widths at the same level as the allowed ones .",
    "we have evaluated the @xmath0 spectrum below the @xmath1 threshold using a reduction of the bse . we have made predictions for the transition rates of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 radiative decays .",
    "we compared our results with the results of other models in the literature .",
    "experimental results will help clarify the spin - spin and spin - orbit splittings of different models and consequently improve our knowledge of physical quantities such as the quark masses and the strong coupling @xmath27 at the scale of @xmath34 .",
    "measurements of radiative transitions and comparison with such results may indicate the existence of exotic multiquark or molecular exotics .",
