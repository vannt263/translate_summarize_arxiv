    "in this section , we have first classified the cooperativity of a single oligomeric enzyme on the basis of the nature of the enzyme - substrate binding and then proposed a stochastic description for each class in terms of a one - dimensional random walk problem .",
    "here we have provided a master equation approach for the description of spatial and temporal cooperativity which is suitable for the calculation of entropy production .",
    "here we have considered that the substrate molecules can bind to the subunits of the oligomeric enzyme sequentially or independently as already discussed in the introduction section . in the oligomeric enzyme kinetics reaction ,",
    "the substrate molecules bind to the subunits of the oligomeric enzyme in a stepwise manner with different affinity which was first proposed by adair to explain the cooperativity phenomenon observed in the oxygen - binding to the hemoglobin at equilibrium@xcite .",

    "hence the site - dependent total formation and dissociation rate constants in the case of the oligomeric enzyme kinetics are similarly defined as @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "the dynamics of the substrate binding mechanisms are quantified by counting the number of occupied sites present in the oligomeric enzyme at a particular instant of time . if at time t , ` @xmath18 ' number of occupied sites are present in the oligomeric enzyme ( the state @xmath3 ) then at time @xmath19 , the number of occupied sites may be increased or decreased by one unit due to the occurrence of a formation or a dissociation reaction . during the time evolution ,",
    "the number of occupied sites is a fluctuating quantity .",
    "therefore , the system performs a one - dimensional random walk along the finite number of states where state-@xmath18 of the system is equivalent to the conformational state @xmath3 , as shown in figure [ fig_1 ] .",
    "the kinetic scheme of the spatially cooperative system is given in figure [ fig_1](a ) .",
    "as the subunits get occupied sequentially starting from subunit-1 , so when we say that the @xmath18-th subunit is occupied it automatically means that @xmath18 number of sites are occupied in total . here",
    "the forward and the backward transition probabilities depend only on the total formation and dissociation rate constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively which are generally site - dependent .",
    "this is so because after the filling of one subunit , there is no other choice for the next substrate molecule but to fill up the next adjacent subunit and as this is true for all the subunits , there is no combinatorial term in the transition probability .",
    "the kinetic scheme for the temporal cooperativity is shown in figure [ fig_1](b ) . here",
    "the substrate molecules can bind independently with any one of the @xmath1 number of subunits .",
    "the state-@xmath18 of the system represents @xmath18-number of occupied sites of the enzyme . in this mechanism ,",
    "the forward transition probability of the n - th state at time t is given by the product of the total formation rate constant @xmath20 with the number of distinct combinations of unoccupied sites present at that time .",

    "these rate constants are taken to be site - dependent in general .",
    "if all the rate constants are site - independent , then the system will be non - cooperative .",
    "the main difference of the sequential binding scheme from the independent one is as follows : _ for the sequential scheme , the system will show spatial cooperativity in substrate binding even when the formation and dissociation rate constants are not site - dependent . _      for the time - dependent description of the spatial cooperativity , we have constructed the corresponding master equation for this cooperativity mechanism as @xmath22 with @xmath23 to match the boundary terms . here",
    ", @xmath24 is the probability of having @xmath25 number of occupied sites at time t. we have given an analytical expression for the solution of the master equation by setting @xmath26 . the steady state distribution of the spatial cooperativity is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28+k_{2}^{(j)}}{k_{-1}^{(j+1)}+k_{-2}^{(j+1)}}$ ] with @xmath29 .",

    "we can obtain the probability distribution as @xmath36 where @xmath37 as already defined with @xmath38 the average number of occupied sites at the ness is simply expressed as @xmath39    now positive cooperativity in this scenario means a higher affinity of a second substrate molecule to attach with the oligomeric enzyme compared to that of the first substrate molecule which is already bound and so on .",
    "therefore , in this case , the successive binding affinity of the substrate molecule increases . so naturally here we take the binding rate constants , @xmath40 as follows @xcite @xmath41 here the site - dependent overall association rate constant @xmath20 is defined as @xmath42 and similarly , the overall site - dependent dissociation rate constant is written as @xmath43 .",
    "we take the rate constants @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 to be site - independent .",
    "this is due to the fact that to get a cooperative behavior for the independent binding case , it is not necessary to take all the rate constants of the reaction system to be site - dependent that will also make the results obtained hard to analyze .",
    "then the site - dependent quantities @xmath47 for positive cooperativity maintain the relation : @xmath48    similarly , negative cooperativity arises as a second substrate molecule binds to the oligomeric enzyme with a lower affinity than that of the first substrate molecule .",
    "therefore , the substrate binding reaction rate constants for different sites obey the inequalities @xmath49 then taking the rate constants @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 as site - independent constants , we have @xmath50    if all the association and dissociation rate constants are site - independent , then the enzyme becomes non - cooperative .",
    "thus the steady state distribution , eq.([stdisttemp ] ) reduces to @xmath51 where @xmath52 . by inserting the value of x",
    ", the above equation can be written as a binomial distribution given by @xmath53 this is expected , as in the absence of any cooperativity , the distribution of the occupied sites must follow a binomial distribution .",
    "so for a system with no cooperativity , the average number of occupied sites at the ness is @xmath54 and the average number of unoccupied sites is @xmath55 we mention that , in addition to the overall association and dissociation rate constants being site - independent , if the rate constant @xmath56 is also negligibly small , then the enzyme kinetics becomes simply the michaelis - menten type . if @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is taken to be much less than the other rate constants , then we have @xmath59}{k_m^{(j ) } } , \\label{kmstpwise}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 can be described as the stepwise michaelis - menten constant .",

    "the system entropy production rate(epr ) can be split as@xcite @xmath86 here the first term in the r.h.s . of equation([2ndlaw ] ) gives the total entropy production rate and the second term denotes the medium entropy production rate due to the entropy flux into the surroundings .",

    "\\(i ) it is clear that if we do not consider the presence of the product species then there will be just two sets of rate constants , @xmath96 and @xmath97 . then at the steady state , the balance condition that holds is obviously the detailed balance which gives @xmath98 then from eq.([stotness ] )",
    ", we have @xmath99 at the steady state which is reduced now to an equilibrium . now from eq.([kmstpwise ] ) , the quantity @xmath47 under this condition becomes @xmath100}{k_{-1}^{(j+1)}}$ ] where @xmath101 are the stepwise equilibrium ( binding ) constants .",
    "so in this limit , theoretically there is no difference between our model and a protein - ligand binding model which generally does not consider the product formation .",
    "\\(ii ) another interesting point is that if we consider the case where @xmath102 ( with @xmath45 being already considered negligible ) then this corresponds to the pre - equilibrium limit or simply the equilibrium limit .",
    "the assumption is valid when fast reversible reactions precede slower reactions in a reaction network . now in this situation also , the quantity @xmath47 is defined in terms of the stepwise equilibrium ( binding ) constants . in this context , we mention that the original derivation of the enzyme catalysis reaction by michaelis and menten involved the pre - equilibrium assumption with the equilibrium dissociation constant parameter . the more general derivation by briggs and haldane used the steady state approximation and their expression contained the actual michaelis - menten constant . in our case",
    "also we see the same features in the quantity , @xmath47 which is the parameter of our model study . in the general nonequilibrium case",
    ", @xmath47 is related to the stepwise michaelis - menten constant , @xmath103 ( see eq.([kmstpwise ] ) with @xmath57 considered negligible ) whereas in the absence of product species leading to equilibrium or under the pre - equilibrium assumption , @xmath47 is related to the stepwise equilibrium ( binding ) constant , @xmath104",
    "in this section , we have calculated the medium , system and the total entropy production for the spatial and temporal cooperative systems . for a given initial condition ,",
    "the oligomeric enzyme system reaches ness at a particular time which depends on the chemiostatic condition , _",
    "i.e _ , the value of the constant substrate concentration .",
    "the initial condition is taken as the fully unbound state of the enzyme with all the subunits being vacant _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath105 .",
    "this condition leads to zero system entropy at t=0 . for the time - dependent system entropy production calculation in general",
    ", one needs the time - dependent solution of the master equation , @xmath62 .",
    "but here the final time in the calculation of the entropy production over the time interval ( starting at @xmath106 with the specified initial condition above ) is taken such that by then the system reaches the ness and hence steady state solutions are all we need to get the system entropy production over the length of the trajectory . the total entropy production for a single trajectory is calculated over the time interval where the determination of the medium entropy production requires the detailed information of the path and not just the initial and final points .",
    "we run the simulations in all the cases up to a fixed point of time taken to be the same for all the binding mechanisms . as the steady state",
    "is an ness ( and not an equilibrium ) , total and medium entropy production increase linearly with time and hence if the final point of time is not the same for all the cases , one can not compare the various entropy production values for the different cooperative systems .      along a single stochastic trajectory",
    "the system entropy production can be defined as@xcite @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the solution of the stochastic master equation for a given initial condition , @xmath109 , taken along the specific trajectory @xmath110 .",
    "note that , the single trajectory entropy is denoted by ( bold ) @xmath111 whereas the trajectory - average entropy production ( equivalent to ensemble average ) is denoted by @xmath112 .",
    "now at the microscopic level , the number of occupied sites of the oligomeric enzyme becomes a fluctuating quantity due to the random occurrence of the different reaction events within the random time interval .",
    "this develops the concept of different trajectories . here",
    "the state of the system can change by any one of the four reactions ( denoted with index @xmath68 ) as discussed in sec.iic .    a stochastic trajectory , @xmath110 starting at the state @xmath113 , jumping at times @xmath114 from the state @xmath115 to the state @xmath116 and finally ending up at @xmath117 with @xmath118 is defined as , @xmath119 here @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the stoichiometric coefficient of the @xmath68-th reaction along a trajectory and @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the time interval between two successive jumps . during the jump from the @xmath124 state to the @xmath125 state , any one of the four reactions will occur ( see eq . ( [ e2esn ] ) and eq . ( [ e2es ] ) ) .",
    "the rate constant of the reaction @xmath68 is denoted as @xmath79 .",
    "the time interval @xmath123 between the two jumps is a random variable following the exponential distribution@xcite @xmath126 with @xmath127 . here",

    "it is clear from the plots that both the quantities grow with a sigmoidal shape as a function of substrate concentration indicating positive cooperativity in substrate binding . according to eq.(@xmath151 ) , this is due to the higher power ( @xmath153 ) dependence of @xmath154 on the factor @xmath155 which is proportional to the substrate concentration . as the rate constants are taken as site - independent , the positive cooperativity generated in the system is inherent in the binding mechanism .",

    "we have plotted the ensemble average system entropy production , @xmath180 as a function of the substrate concentration in figure [ fig_6 ] for all the cases . in figure [ fig_6](a ) , @xmath180 is plotted for spatial cooperativity and in figure [ fig_6](b - d ) it is shown for the positive , negative and non - cooperative cases , respectively which belong to the class of temporal cooperativity .",
    "the first thing evident from the plots is that @xmath180 passes through a global maximum for all the cases and in the case of negative cooperativity , there is also a local maximum with the parameters of our system .",
    "we have plotted @xmath179 as a function of the substrate concentration in figure [ fig_7](a - d ) with the steady state ( ` @xmath181 ' ) superscript being dropped for simplicity .",
    "figure [ fig_7](a ) shows the curves for spatial cooperativity .",
    "we can see that they all cross almost exactly at the same point , @xmath12 \\sim 600\\hspace{0.1 cm } \\mu m$ ] giving rise to the maximum in @xmath182 for spatial cooperativity at this point ( see figure [ fig_6](a ) ) . in figure [ fig_7](b ) , we have shown the curves for the positively cooperative system . at @xmath12\\sim 60\\hspace{0.1cm}\\mu m$ ] , the curves cross in a pairwise fashion ; curves of @xmath183 and @xmath184 cross each other at this point as well as curves for @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "this particular substrate concentration corresponds to the maximum of @xmath182 in this case ( see figure [ fig_6](b ) ) .",
    "the case of negative cooperativity requires a bit more attention .",
    "there is again pairwise curve crossing of the two sets of probabilities same as in the case of positive cooperativity at the same substrate concentration shown in figure [ fig_7](c ) .",
    "this gives rise to the global maximum in the curve of @xmath182 for this type of binding shown in figure [ fig_6](c ) .",
    "the local maximum can be explained as follows .",
    "unlike the plots in figure [ fig_7](a ) and ( b ) , the probability curves @xmath186 and @xmath184 remain at significant values over the substrate range studied and the dominance of these two probability curves in figure [ fig_7](c ) ( actually when @xmath186 and @xmath184 cross , they are close to @xmath187 at @xmath12 \\sim 1800 \\hspace{0.1cm}\\mu m$ ] ) over a large substrate range gives rise to an increase of @xmath182 , albeit slow .",
    "finally we come to the case of non - cooperativity in figure [ fig_7](d ) where again there is the pairwise crossing of the same set of probabilities as in figure [ fig_7](b ) but at @xmath12 \\sim 600 \\hspace{0.1cm}\\mu m$ ] that again gives rise to the maximum of @xmath182 shown in figure [ fig_6](d ) . in this case too , there are more than one dominating probability curves before and after the pairwise crossing over similar substrate range as in figure [ fig_7](c ) . but the @xmath182 in this case shows a slow but steady decrease with substrate concentration after passing through the maximum without any unusual behavior",
    ". this may be due to the fact that here at least three of the four probabilities are significant ( with comparable values ) over a large substrate range and so they do not cross the value of @xmath187 in this range unlike the case in figure [ fig_7](c ) .",
    "it is clear that arbitrary variation of the rate constants of the system in each binding step can make life more complicated and then the maxima in the @xmath182 curve may or may not be associated with the binding probability curve crossings .",
    "we can justify the curve crossings , whether they all cross or cross pairwise at a particular substrate concentration , by inspecting the expressions of the steady state probability distributions .",
    "we see from the steady state distribution for the spatial cooperativity , eq.([geometricdistribution ] ) , that if one of the probabilities , say @xmath188 is approximately equal to any other probability , say @xmath189 , then @xmath190 ( but obviously not exactly equal to 1 ) and this automatically leads to the near equality of all the probabilities at this value of @xmath155 .",
    "this is true for all the probabilities and hence in this case the probabilities can only cross simultaneously at @xmath190 . as the probabilities are equal at this point which corresponds to @xmath12\\sim 600 \\hspace{0.1cm}\\mu m$ ] , this obviously gives the maximum system entropy production in this case .",
    "now we take the steady state distribution of the non - cooperative case , eq.([binom ] ) .",
    "it can be easily seen that here only @xmath191 leads to the equality @xmath192 at @xmath193 giving the maximum of @xmath182 again at @xmath12\\sim 600 \\hspace{0.1cm}\\mu m$ ] .",
    "so in the context of the system entropy production the spatial cooperative system shows some similarity with the non - cooperative system . with the same set of site - independent rate constants ,",
    "the spatial cooperative system is also associated with larger system entropy production compared to that of the non - cooperative case .",
    "this is because all the binding probabilities become equal for the spatial cooperativity whereas they become equal pairwise for non - cooperative binding .",
    "the cases of positive and negative cooperativity belonging to the class of temporal cooperativity are a bit complicated .",
    "we have considered a 10-fold increase of the substrate binding rate constant for each successive binding in the case of positive cooperativity whereas a 10-fold decrease in the corresponding rate constant for each successive binding for negative cooperativity .",
    "this symmetry ensures that in both the cases only @xmath191 leads to the equality @xmath192 at @xmath194 . this can be easily proved from eq.([stdisttemp ] ) .",
    "but if the rise or fall of the value of the substrate binding rate constant in each successive step of binding is not by the same factor , then the pairwise equality of the binding probabilities is not possible at a given substrate concentration .",
    "here we have discussed on the determination of the hill coefficient from the master equation corresponding to the different binding schemes .",
    "we have also introduced an index of cooperativity in terms of the stochastic system entropy associated with the fully bound state of the cooperative and non - cooperative cases .",
    "we have analyzed its connection to the hill coefficient using some relevant experimental data which gives a realistic application of the proposed scheme of measurement of cooperativity .      in the traditional enzymology ,",
    "the characterization of cooperativity is carried out by measuring the hill coefficient @xcite . for positive and negative cooperative cases ,",
    "the hill coefficient becomes greater than or less than one , respectively , whereas the non - cooperative case is characterized with hill coefficient equal to one .",
    "experimentally it is obtained by determining the fractional saturation , @xmath195(@xmath196 ) at various substrate concentrations @xmath12 $ ] , constructing the hill plot ( @xmath197 vs. @xmath198 $ ] ) and then finding the slope at the half - saturation point , @xmath199 or at a point where the slope deviates maximum from unity . on the other hand ,",
    "hill coefficient is theoretically defined as the ratio of the variances of the binding number of the cooperative and non - cooperative cases at the half - saturation point with the non - cooperative binding case following the binomial distribution@xcite .",
    "we briefly mention the features of the hill plot for the model binding schemes studied here .",
    "the slope of the hill plot is generally given by @xcite @xmath200(d\\theta / d[s])}{\\theta(1-\\theta)}. \\label{slope}\\ ] ] for temporal cooperativity , the fractional saturation can be written as ( see eq.([navrgind ] ) ) @xmath201^n}{n_t\\sum_n b_n[s]^n},\\ ] ] where @xmath202 with @xmath203 then one gets @xmath204 where @xmath205 and @xmath206 are the variances of the binding numbers of the temporal and non - cooperative cases , respectively .",
    "the hill coefficient , @xmath207 is given at the half - saturation point as@xcite @xmath208 .",
    "similar expressions hold for the spatial cooperative binding .",
    "we have already mentioned in sec.iib that if all the rate constants of the independent binding scheme are site - independent , then the binding is non - cooperative with binomial distribution of the binding probability .",
    "here we discuss the corresponding scenario for the sequential binding ( leading to spatial cooperativity ) to be non - cooperative in terms of the variance of the binding number . in the case of spatial cooperativity ,",
    "the variance of the binding number , @xmath209 is given by @xmath210 where @xmath155 and @xmath211 are as given in eq.([geometricdistribution ] ) and eq.([avgpopspace ] ) .",
    "now for @xmath212 , this reduces to @xmath213 and then the slope of the hill plot becomes @xmath214 for any substrate concentration .",
    "so for sequential binding , the cooperative behavior is absent only if the enzyme is monomeric .",
    "here we introduce an index of cooperativity .",
    "first we build up the concept from binding probabilities and then demonstrate how this index can indicate the nature of the cooperativity . for positive cooperative binding , one expects that full occupancy of the enzyme is more probable compared to the case of non - cooperativity .",
    "similarly , for negative cooperativity , the full occupancy of the enzyme is less probable . now",
    ", if the probability of an event - n is @xmath215 , then the associated surprisal is given by @xmath216 and more probable the event , the less is its surprisal .",
    "so the ratio of the surprisals , associated with the probability of the system to remain in a fully occupied state without and with cooperativity at ness , should be greater than @xmath217 for positive cooperativity and less than @xmath217 for negative cooperativity .",
    "hence we define the index of cooperativity , denoted by @xmath218 in terms of the ratio of the surprisals , associated with the probability of the system to remain in a fully occupied state without and with cooperativity at ness as @xmath219 where the binomial distribution , @xmath220 is the reference corresponding to the non - cooperative case and the distribution @xmath221 corresponds to the cooperative binding case .",
    "the rate constants of the reference non - cooperative system ( binomial ) must be the same as those of the starting or initial rate constants of the cooperative system for the comparison to be valid .",
    "the relation is then independent of the actual value of the ( constant ) substrate concentration .",
    "we point out that the surprisal is equivalent to the single trajectory stochastic system entropy@xcite ( associated with the fully occupied state ) .",
    "so the index , c is truly an entropic estimate of cooperativity at the microscopic level .",
    "based on the above argument , next we theoretically analyze the probability to remain in a fully occupied state for different cooperative systems and compare that with the non - cooperative case to formulate the criteria of cooperativity in terms of c. for spatial cooperativity , the ratio of its steady state distribution ( eq.([geometricdistribution ] ) ) and the reference binomial distribution ( eq.([binom ] ) ) for @xmath222 is given by @xmath223 @xmath224 } { ( 1-x^{n_t + 1})}. \\label{rsp}\\ ] ] > from the above expression it is clear that for all values of @xmath155 , either greater than or less than 1 , the quantity @xmath225 is greater than 1 indicating positive cooperativity .",
    "this will lead to the condition @xmath226 for the case of spatial cooperativity for any substrate concentration . only in the case of monomeric enzyme , ( @xmath227 )",
    ", the system will be non - cooperative with @xmath228 as already discussed in terms of variances at the end of sec.iva .    in the case of temporal cooperativity , the corresponding ratio",

    "now both @xmath234 and @xmath235 tend to 1 at large @xmath236 _ i.e. _ large substrate concentration .",
    "but it is clear that for positive cooperative binding with @xmath237 , the last term in the denominator of @xmath234 dominates the previous terms more readily compared to the case of @xmath235 .",
    "hence at a particular substrate concentration , @xmath234 is closer to 1 compared to @xmath235 and so @xmath229 is greater than 1 . for negative cooperativity with @xmath238 , the situation is obviously reverse and @xmath229 is less than 1",
    "therefore , in the light of the above discussions and eq.([surp ] ) , we write down the condition of cooperativity in terms of @xmath218 as @xmath239 this is the same criteria of cooperativity as given in terms of the hill coefficient . to find out the hill coefficient , _",
    "i.e. , _ the variances theoretically , it is necessary to know the probability distribution of the corresponding positive and negative cooperativity cases , respectively .",
    "now our measure of cooperativity , the index c , is also related to the probability distributions ; but it is defined in terms of the ratio of a specific term of the distributions , namely the probability of the fully occupied state .",
    "so apparently there is no straightforward connection between the hill coefficient and c. the hill coefficient is the slope of the binding curve at a particular substrate concentration corresponding to the half - saturation point whereas the index c is defined independent of the substrate concentration and the characterization of cooperativity in terms of c is valid at any substrate concentration .",
    "we have plotted the quantity , c in figure ( [ fig_9 ] ) for positive cooperative system ( independent binding ) and also for the spatial cooperative binding for different values of @xmath240 as a function of substrate concentration . for the positive cooperativity case ,",
    "the substrate binding rate constants , @xmath96 increase by a factor of @xmath241 in each step .",
    "the value of c grows with substrate concentration , starting just above @xmath242 and finally saturates .",
    "one can see from eq.([surp ] ) , that the limiting value of c ( obtained at high substrate concentration ) in case of spatial cooperativity is @xmath240 whereas for temporal cooperativity it is given by @xmath243 where @xmath244 .",
    "these results are discussed in detail in the appendix . here",
    "we specifically mention the case of @xmath245 for the positive cooperativity where the limiting value of @xmath218 is @xmath246 .",
    "it is evident from figure ( [ fig_9])(a ) that this is indeed the case .",
    "although apparently there is no straightforward connection between the hill coefficient , @xmath207 and c , first of all it is clear that the well - known criteria of cooperativity in terms of @xmath207 is exactly the criteria we have given in terms of the cooperativity index , c in eq.([mratio ] ) .",
    "both the measures are equal to @xmath247 in the absence of cooperativity whereas for cooperative binding , the criteria are the same although the actual values of @xmath207 and c will be generally different . here",
    "we will try to illustrate this point using some experimental data from the work of kolodziej _ et al . _",

    "the values of the hill coefficient , @xmath207 in the parentheses are from the experimental work , given for comparison with the values determined here . the cooperativity index , c characterizes the cooperative behavior successfully as can be seen by comparing it with @xmath207 .",
