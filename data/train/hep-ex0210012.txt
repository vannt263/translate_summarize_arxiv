    "in 1973 kobayashi and maskawa ( km ) proposed a model where @xmath3 violation is incorporated as an irreducible complex phase in the weak - interaction quark mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of the @xmath3-violating parameter @xmath4 by the belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite collaborations have clearly established @xmath3 violation in the neutral @xmath2 meson system that is consistent with km expectations .",
    "the next step in the program is measurements of other @xmath3-violating parameters .",
    "here we describe recent measurements of @xmath3-violating asymmetries in the mode @xmath5  ; these are sensitive to the parameter @xmath6 ( also known as @xmath7 ) .",
    "to measure @xmath8 ( a.k.a @xmath9 ) , the two most promising approaches involve the use of the decay modes @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the former is an example of a cp eigenstate and is thus the most straightforward approach as well as the mode with the best senstivity .",
    "the interference in the @xmath12 mode between the direct decay and the decay via mixing leads to a cp violating asymmetry with a sin - like time modulation as in charmonium cp eigenstate modes such as @xmath13 .",
    "the km model predicts sizeable @xmath3-violating asymmetries in the time - dependent rates for @xmath14 and @xmath15 decays to a common @xmath3 eigenstate , @xmath16 . in the decay chain @xmath17 , where one of @xmath2 mesons decays at time @xmath18 to @xmath16 and",

    "the experimental technique is similar to that used for the @xmath35 measurement @xcite .",
    "however , there are several additional complications and differences .",
    "the decay amplitude for @xmath0 contains a contribution from a tree diagram ( @xmath36 ) as well as a cabibbo suppressed penguin diagram ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the penguin contribution is not negligible and has a weak phase that is different from the phase of the larger tree amplitude , which is zero in the usual parameterization . in general",
    ", the penguin contribution will also have a strong phase .",
    "therefore the time dependent asymmetry , proportional to @xmath38 and parameterized by @xmath29 , which is measured is not equal to @xmath6 but instead will have a large unknown correction .",
    "the presence of the extra contribution also induces an additional time dependent term proportional to @xmath39 , parameterized by @xmath30@xcite .",
    "this is called _",
    "penguin pollution_. as the notation @xmath30 suggests , the asymmetry term with @xmath39 modulation is due to direct cp violation . note that unlike the mixing induced cp violation , the direct cp violation term does not time integrate to zero .",
    "there are a number of other purely experimental complications .",
    "the branching fraction for the @xmath0 decay is quite small ( see table  [ table_bf ] ) compared to the charmonium modes , only @xmath40 .",
    "thus , very large data samples are required .",
    "the babar results are based on a sample of @xmath41 @xmath42 pairs .",
    "belle has recorded a sample of comparable size , but has published results with a subset of @xmath43 @xmath42 pairs .",
    "the other challenging requirement for the detector is the separation of kaons from pions at high momentum .",
    "this is needed to distinguish @xmath44 from @xmath45 , which has similar kinematics and a branching fraction about three times larger .",
    "two approaches to high momentum particle identification have been implemented at the @xmath2 factory experiments .",
    "both are based on the use of cerenkov radiation .    at belle ,",
    "aerogel cerenkov radiators are used .",
    "blocks of aerogel are readout by fine - mesh phototubes that have high - gain and operate comfortably in a 1.5 tesla magnetic field . since the threshold for the aerogel is around 1.5 gev , below this momentum k/@xmath46 separation",
    "is carried out using high precision time - of - flight scintillators with resolution of 95 ps .",
    "the aerogel and tof counter system are complemented by de / dx measurements in the central drift chamber .",
    "the de / dx system provides additional k/@xmath46 separation around 2.5 gev in the relativistic rise region as well as below 0.7 gev . for high momentum kaons ,",
    "an efficiency of 88% with a misidentification probability below 9% has been achieved .    at babar ,",
    "cerenkov light is produced in quartz bars and then transmitted by total internal reflection outside the detector through a water tank to a large array of phototubes where the ring is imaged .",
