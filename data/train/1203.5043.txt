    "standard model ( sm ) of particle physics does not admit mass terms for the neutrinos .",
    "this was motivated by the absence of observational evidence of right handed neutrinos . however , in the last decades , neutrino interferometry experiments have observed oscillation of neutrinos .",
    "this is ascribed to neutrino mass and their mixing among different generations .",
    "neutrino oscillation data gives neutrino mass squared differences , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , to the order of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ev@xmath5 respectively @xcite . also from cosmology",
    ", we have an upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses @xcite which is @xmath6 ev . from the results of these observations",
    "it is clear that the neutrino masses are orders of magnitude smaller than other fermions _",
    "i.e. _ charged leptons and quarks .",
    "a standard procedure to generate such a small neutrino mass naturally is to add heavy fields to the sm particle spectra . below the mass scale of the heavy field",
    ", it gets integrated out from the theory and gives rise to the effective lagrangian containing higher dimensional operators .",
    "these operators are _ non - renormalizable _ , and sm gauge group invariant .",
    "the lowest dimensional of such operators is the dimension-5 operator @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the sm lepton and higgs doublets . as we can see from the above expression",
    ", @xmath10 has the dimension of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the mass of the right handed heavy particle .",
    "this operator violates lepton number by two units and leads to majorana masses for neutrinos . after spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb )",
    ", the @xmath9 field acquires vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath13 and consequently neutrino mass becomes ; @xmath14 . with @xmath15 gev , to produce neutrino mass of @xmath16 ev , @xmath12 has to be of the order of @xmath17 gev ) .",
    "this way of generating small neutrino masses , by integrating out the heavy field is popularly called seesaw mechanism ( type - i ) @xcite .",
    "the next set of higher dimensional operators that arise in the theory are the dimension six operators .",
    "list of different dimension six operators can be found in @xcite .",
    "a linear combination of two such operators is of special relevance in connection with the neutrino mass and mixings @xcite .",
    "this operator is expressed as @xmath18 note that this operator is of dirac type in contrast with the majorana type operator ( [ kappa - intro ] ) .",
    "after symmetry breaking , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ non - unin - intro ] ) becomes @xmath19 which makes the coefficient of neutrino kinetic term deviate from unity by an amount of @xmath20 .",
    "now , in order to bring the kinetic term in its usual canonical form , the field @xmath21 is rescaled with a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "this also modifies the charged current interaction .",
    "consequently the lepton mixing matrix , @xmath0 , becomes non - unitary by a factor of @xmath23 @xcite . because of this , the operator in eq .",
    "( [ non - unin - intro ] ) is called the non - unitary operator and @xmath24 is called the non - unitary parameter .",
    "the dimension of @xmath24 is @xmath25 . with @xmath12",
    "is of the order of @xmath17 gev ) , non - unitarity is highly suppressed .",
    "signature of such heavy neutrinos can not be tested at colliders as their mass scale is way beyond the reach of these experiments .",
    "therefore , from the point of view of testability at collider , one needs to bring down the seesaw scale to tev .",
    "one way to circumvent this problem is provided by inverse seesaw @xcite . in these scenarios ( _ i.e. _ tev scale seesaw @xcite ) , mass scale of the heavy field is of the order of @xmath26 gev ) and hence non - unitarity can be appreciable _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath27 .",
    "consequently the deviation of @xmath0 from unitarity can be significant and can have testable consequences @xcite .    as we know",
    "that these type of operators arise at comparatively higher scale whereas observations are made at a much lower scale @xcite , the effect of renormalization group evolution ( rge ) needs to be incorporated .",
    "rge for the dimension five operator , in the context of seesaw mechanism , is well known in the literature @xcite .",
    "rge of the non - unitary operator is , however , not as widely studied . in @xcite only part of the @xmath28-function of the non unitary parameter is computed .",
    "here we shall present a detailed analysis of the origin of the non - unitary operator in the context of type - i seesaw and one loop correction to that . since the non - unitary operator becomes significant in tev scale models , the rg running of this operator from the tev scale to the electro - weak symmetry breaking scale",
    "is not expected to be as large as operators which are significant at very high energy ( @xmath29 gev ) .",
    "but as neutrino physics has entered the precision era , so strictly speaking , rge of the non - unitary operator should be explored . also for some cases , _",
    "e.g. _ , where symmetry enforces @xmath30 to be zero , a small rg running could evade the symmetry and may give a non - zero value of @xmath30 as indicated by present data @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows ; in section 2 we shall present the lagrangian , origin of non - unitarity at high scale and its renormalization procedure . in section 3",
    "we give the one loop correction to the non - unitary operator , lepton doublet and higgs doublet .",
    "section 4 contains @xmath28-function of the non - unitary operator .",
    "we summarize in section 5 .",
    "appendix a contains the feynman rules and appendix b contains the divergent part of different feynman diagrams .",
    "we add right handed gauge singlet heavy field to the sm particle spectra with mass is @xmath31 .",
    "the extended part of the lagrangian is @xmath32 where @xmath9 denotes @xmath33 higgs doublet with @xmath34 ; @xmath35 is the @xmath36 anti - symmetric tensor .",
    "the lepton doublet of generation @xmath37 is denoted by @xmath38 , and @xmath39 denote the heavy neutrino fields .",

    "one can construct four possible dimension-6 dirac type operators in the context of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , two in each cases . here we present one from each of them .",
