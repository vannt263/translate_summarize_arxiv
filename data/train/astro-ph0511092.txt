    "dust in disks can be quite different from dust in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "observations and chemical modeling ( @xcite , @xcite ) suggest that the dust in the early stages of star formation is primarily composed of small ( @xmath31  @xmath1 m ) amorphous silicates with strong features at approximately 9.7 and 18.5  @xmath1 m ( for a summary , see * ? ? ?",
    "large modifications of the dust occur in the envelopes and disks around young stars , as the initially small grains are processed via collisions and coagulation .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( sed ) indicate that grain growth , and the corresponding settling of large grains to the disk midplane , is occurring in some disks .",
    "dust settling and growth affect disk temperatures and vertical structures , resulting in dust photospheres that are flatter rather than flared ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , some main sequence stars show evidence of a `` second generation '' of small grains in a debris disk , produced by the collision and fragmentation of planetesimals , that may be quite different from the `` primordial '' dust .    the spectroscopic study of silicate emission has proven a valuable tracer of grain processing within young circumstellar disks .",
    "this method probes small grains via optically thin emission from the surface layer of generally optically thick disks .",
    "studies of @xmath010  @xmath1 m silicate emission from herbig ae / be stars ( hereafter haebe ) and t  tauri stars ( hereafter tts ) with disks show early evidence of the growth of these surface - layer grains from @xmath00.1 to 2.0  @xmath1 m ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "detections of additional spectral features arising from crystalline silicate emission in some haebe and tts disks @xcite , the debris disk @xmath4 pictoris ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and comets ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide evidence for silicate processing during the disk phase .",
    "although changes in grain size and composition are closely linked to disk properties and planet formation , the rate and mechanism of grain growth and processing in disks are still not well understood .",
    "previous studies of silicate emission from tts disks were primarily focused on the si - o stretching mode feature near 10  @xmath1 m , which can be observed from the ground .",
    "grain growth and crystallization , however , have similar effects on the shape of the 10  @xmath1 m feature . in these previous studies ,",
    "the presence of crystalline silicates was often established through the presence of flux at 11.3  @xmath1 m , corresponding to an emission feature of the crystalline mg - rich silicate forsterite , in addition to the presence of an amorphous olivine feature at 9.8  @xmath1 m .",
    "the combined effect is a broad , trapezoidal silicate emission feature with a peak near 9.7  @xmath1 m and a secondary peak near 11.3  @xmath1 m .",
    "if crystalline silicates are abundant , the feature can appear broader and flatter .",
    "in contrast , growth of amorphous olivines can mimic the effects of crystalline - amorphous silicate mixtures , resulting in weaker , `` flat - topped '' 10  @xmath1 m silicate features , with similar flux at 9.8 and 11.3  @xmath1 m ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the above studies showed that the flattened silicate features were well matched by models of purely amorphous olivines with grain sizes ( radii ) of 2  @xmath1 m .",
    "therefore , evaluation of the grain size and/or crystallinity requires observations of a larger spectral region , in which the presence of distinct forsterite or enstatite features ( and pahs , which emit near 7.7 , 8.5 , and 11.2  @xmath1 m ) can be assessed .",
    "complementary studies of the o - si - o bending mode near 20 @xmath1 m probe slightly cooler dust and combined give a better sense of the grain size and crystalline fraction in the disk .",
    "spectra covering a large spectral region , including several isolated crystalline silicate features ( 27.5 , 33.5 , 35.8 and 70  @xmath1 m ) , were obtained for disks around haebe stars ( and some tts ) with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) .",
    "iso observations of several disks around intermediate - mass haebe stars clearly established the presence / absence of crystalline silicates ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews )",
    ". additionally , iso observations probed the @xmath010 and @xmath020  @xmath1 m emission features from amorphous silicates in haebe disks , allowing grain growth to be studied ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . due to sensitivity limitations , iso studies of silicates focused primarily on intermediate or high - mass stars .",
    "studies of tts have therefore been limited , for the most part , to the 10  @xmath1 m region .",
    "although changes in the shape of the 10  @xmath1 m emission features are observed in small samples of tts @xcite , the cause of these changes is unclear and could be a combination of silicate grain growth and crystallization .    in this study ,",
    "the improved sensitivity of the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) aboard the spitzer space telescope was used to expand such spectroscopic studies to include a large sample of disks around low - mass , sun - like stars , creating a database analogous to iso studies of @xmath0high / intermediate - mass stars .",
    "a few haebe stars were also observed for comparison .",
    "the data presented here are part of the c2d spitzer legacy program designed to study the evolution of circumstellar matter ` from molecular cores to planet - forming disks ' @xcite .",
    "this paper contains preliminary results from the program and will focus on statistical analysis of the strongest silicate features .",
    "it will be followed by a more detailed study of weaker features , including emission from crystalline silicates .",
    "the spitzer irs observations are described in @xmath52 . in @xmath53",
    ", an inventory of the most prominent silicate emission features will be presented .",
    "the observed spectra will be compared with models of amorphous silicates in @xmath54 .",
    "we perform a statistical analysis of the 10 and 20  @xmath1 m silicate features and interpret these trends in terms of grain growth in @xmath55 . then in @xmath56",
    ", we examine the relationship between the strength - shape trends found in @xmath55 and spectral type , stellar age , and h@xmath2 equivalent width . finally , in @xmath57 , we discuss the crystalline silicate emission features in the observed spectra .",

    "a correction to the zero level was applied to correct for background emission .",
    "good sections of the background corrected spectra were used to estimate the zero level in the other modules .",

    "the lattice modes of crystalline silicates at @xmath13  @xmath1 m appear to be more prominent than the 11.3  @xmath1 m feature in our data and do not suffer from confusion with pah emission .",
    "approximately half of the disks in our sample show emission features near 28  @xmath1 m and in the 33 - 35  @xmath1 m region , characteristic of crystalline enstatite and forsterite .",

    "* for summary ) .",
    "as the 10 and 20  @xmath1 m emission features from amorphous silicates are the most easily identified and isolated , the rest of this paper will focus on the analysis of these features .",

    "these sources will be discussed in more detail in brown et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "the continuum fits are overlaid on the observed spectra in figures  [ fig : spec_tt ] and [ fig : spec_h ] as dash - dotted lines . the continuum fitting regions were chosen to represent the areas least affected by features in the spectra and , as shown , vary slightly from source to source .",
    "opacities obtained from laboratory spectra of amorphous olivines ( see @xmath54 ) indicate that the regions chosen above should be clear of amorphous silicate emission features , with the exception of the region from @xmath01315  @xmath1 m , which likely contains contributions from the wings of both the 10 and 20  @xmath1 m features .",
    "thus , the feature strengths obtained from the continuum normalized spectra will be underestimated .",
    "after the continuum fitting was performed , the normalized spectra @xmath14 were obtained via application of the formula , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the observed spectrum and @xmath17 is the fitted continuum , both in units of jy , and @xmath18 is the frequency averaged continuum flux .",
    "we divide by a frequency averaged value of the continuum flux in order to remove any dependence on the slope of the continuum .",
    "this normalization method , including the offset of 1.0 , is consistent with the method used by @xcite and @xcite , to which we compare in @xmath55 .",
    "as the continuum may change dramatically between 10 and 20  @xmath1 m for some sources ( e.g. , coku tau 4 ) , @xmath18 is calculated separately for regions of @xmath1913  @xmath1 m and @xmath2037  @xmath1 m .",

    "the spectral indices are calculated as , @xmath27 where @xmath28  @xmath1 m , @xmath29  @xmath1 m , and @xmath30 is the flux - density at wavelength @xmath31 in units of erg @xmath32 s@xmath33  @xmath1m@xmath33 .",
    "the bulk of the spectra are relatively flat or falling in units of @xmath34 , with @xmath351 and @xmath361.5 ( see figure  [ fig : cont20um ] ) .",

    "we have used the grain radius ( @xmath46 ) of the filled , homogeneous sphere as a proxy for the grain mass , which is held constant for both mie and dhs models .",
    "as indicated in figure  [ fig : qabsoliv ] , the slope of the overall spectrum varies significantly as a function of grain size .",

    "we will compare the 10 and 20  @xmath1 m silicate features in the observed spectra to the mie and dhs models ( figure  [ fig:4 ] ) .",

    "this may be explained , if the emission is optically thin , by a difference in the @xmath96 surface depth as a function of wavelength of the emission ; 20  @xmath1 m features probe a deeper layer of the disk where grain sizes are likely larger due to larger density and dust settling .",
    "one would also expect , however , that dust at larger radii ( and lower temperature ) , which is likely smaller due to decreased densities , contributes more to the 20  @xmath1 m feature than the 10  @xmath1 m feature .",

    "this may explain why most of the data points are centered around the dashed lines that denote equal grain sizes for 10 and 20  @xmath1 m emission .",
    "in the case of the outliers , enhanced dust settling may make the disk height differential between dust probed by the two features more important than the difference in radius .",

    "additionally , the 10 and 20  @xmath1 m ratios of models of varying grain composition and crystallinity encompass ranges in which no observational data lie .",
    "in particular , spectra showing weak 10  @xmath1 m features ( @xmath100 ) _ and _ strong 20  @xmath1 m features can be easily produced with models of small - sized ( @xmath101  @xmath1 m ) amorphous silicate / carbonaceous grains or moderately - sized ( @xmath102  @xmath1 m ) crystalline silicate grains , but they are not seen in the @xmath60 sample .",
    "these absences confirm the idea that the 20  @xmath1 m feature probes regions of larger grain size than does the 10  @xmath1 m feature , irrespective of grain composition and crystallinity .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig : f10vs20]f we explore the effects of grain opacity by increasing the vacuum fraction of a set of olivine grains and by using the distribution of hollow spheres method ( dhs ) . in both cases , we integrate over a grain size distribution as in figure  [ fig : f10vs20]d  e . the primary difference between the two methods",
    "is that the opacities calculated with dhs are the average of a set of hollow spheres of varying vacuum fractions for a given mass , which is translated to grain size .",

    "variations in dust porosity can only explain a fraction of the bulk of the sample , which overlaps with the regions covered by models of varying grain composition , and can not explain the outliers .",

    "in order to evaluate the dependence of the strength - shape trend noted in @xmath55 on stellar and disk parameters , we plot the 10  @xmath1 m shape versus strength again in figures  [ fig : vbprop]a  c , color - coded by spectral type , stellar age , and h@xmath2 equivalent width ( for tts only ) .",
    "stellar / disk parameters for each source observed in this study ( _ c2d _ ) were collected from the literature and are shown in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "stellar / disk parameters for 10  @xmath1 m data obtained from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( _ lit _ ) are shown in table  [ tab : lit ] .",
    "we evaluate the probability that the sets of spectral type , stellar age or h@xmath2 equivalent width bins are drawn from the same distribution on the 10  @xmath1 m feature shape - strength relation shown in figure  [ fig : vb]a by evaluating the two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov statistic ( @xmath103 )   for each stellar / disk parameter .",
    "as we are evaluating the dependence of the strength - shape trend on stellar / disk parameters , we use only the sources with @xmath104 , thus removing sources with substantial emission from crystalline silicates and/or pahs .",
    "some stellar / disk parameters are not available in the literature , and therefore not all sources are included in figures  [ fig : vbprop]a , b , and c.          as the data in our sample ( filled symbols ) appear to be consistent with the largest silicate grain sizes , and probe disks around primarily k and m stars , we first looked for connections between grain size and spectral type .",
    "we divide the sample by spectral type into four groups : 1 ) a / b , 2 ) f / g , 3 ) k and 4 ) m. the a and b stars and f and g stars were combined into single groups as few stars of each type were observed .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test is used to compare two arrays of data values and the process is repeated for each combination of groups 1 through 4 . in general",
    ", there appears to be a dependence on spectral type , with a / b stars being clustered toward the middle and lower right of the 10  @xmath1 m feature strength - shape trend and m stars being more clustered toward the upper left of figure[fig : vbprop ] .",
    "this can be more easily seen in figure  [ fig : histsptype ] , where histograms of the 10  @xmath1 m shape - to - strength ratio for a / b stars and m stars are compared .",
    "the population of a / b stars peaks at ratios near 0.1 and decreases for larger ratios , while only a few m stars have shape - to - strength ratios near 0.1 and the population increases for larger ratios to peak near 0.50.6 .",
    "although it appears that 10  @xmath1 m silicate emission may be different in a / b stars versus m stars , a larger data set is needed to confirm this result .",
    "the calculated probabilities that these groups are drawn from the same distribution range from 15% ( @xmath105 ) for spectral types a / b and m to 98% ( @xmath106 ) for spectral types a / b and f / g .",
    "objects that are close in spectral type , in subsequent groups ( e.g. , 1 vs. 2 , 2 . vs. 3 ) , have large probabilities ( 6998% ) of being drawn from the same distribution .",
    "groups with larger differences in spectral type ( e.g. , 1 vs. 3 , 2 . vs. 4 ) have smaller probabilities ( 1550% ) .",
    "of all these comparisons , however , only the k - s test for group 1 vs. 4 ( a / b vs. m ) indicates a low enough probability ( @xmath107% , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to suggest that the differences in the populations are statistically significant . furthermore , the number of objects in each group is still quite low ( 13 a / b stars , 4 f / g stars , 24 k stars , and 15 m stars ) and the spectral types typically have errors on the order of 3 subclasses .    the dependence of the strength - shape trend with spectral type may be explained in terms of the disk temperature and density structure .",
    "if we assume that the 10  @xmath1 m feature always probes grains of roughly the same temperature , then the radius being probed by the 10  @xmath1 m emission will change as a function of the temperature structure of the disk .",
    "the disk temperature @xmath108 varies as a function of radius as @xmath109 ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath2 is the disk flaring angle and @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the stellar radius and temperature .",
    "@xmath112 is the radius corresponding to temperature @xmath108 , in this case the dominant radius being probed by the silicate emission feature , which we will call @xmath113 .",
    "assuming that @xmath114 and @xmath2 are constant over the entire disk sample , and using typical values of @xmath110 and @xmath111 for a / b and m stars , @xmath115@xmath116 .",
    "so the radius probed by the 10  @xmath1 m emission feature is quite different for stars of spectral types a / b and m. furthermore , the density generally increases with decreasing radius and grain growth increases at higher density , while dust settling decreases at higher density .",
    "thus , the combination of faster grain growth and slower dust settling at smaller radii could lead to the larger grains that we see in m stars versus a / b stars .",
    "although this simple theory is consistent with the observed correlation of grain size with spectral type , several other spectral - type dependent factors ( e.g. , x - rays , uv radiation , stellar / disk winds , etc . )",
    "likely influence grain size in these disks .",
    "although one might expect grain growth and crystallization to occur over time , as the disk matures , we see no clear relationship between the strength - shape trend and stellar age ( figure  [ fig : vbprop]b ) .",
    "the ages for our sample are culled from the literature and range from 0.5 to 6 myr with errors of up to a few myr ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore divide up the sample into three approximately equally sized groups : stars with ages of 1 ) @xmath3 1.5 myr , 2 ) 1.54 myr , and 3 ) @xmath8 4 myr , and follow a similar method as described above for the analysis of spectral type",
    ". the strength - shape trend does not appear to be strongly related to the age of the star ( figure  [ fig : vbprop]b ) , with probabilities of @xmath847% that all three groups are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "however , this analysis would be more conclusive for stars within one cluster with a well defined age , for which relative ages could be more accurately determined . with the available ages ,",
    "these results indicate that the stellar age of pms stars is not directly related to the state of the small , @xmath1m - sized grains in these disks .",
    "in addition to the difficulties in determining the disk age , the lack of an age dependence of the shape - strength trend can be understood when grain fragmentation and disk turbulence are considered .",
    "@xcite find that in models including only basic coagulation mechanisms grain growth occurs very quickly , such that the seds show much weaker ir excess ( even at young ages of 1 myr ) than do disks around most classical tts .",
    "the settling of small grains , removing them from the disk surface , occurs over even faster time scales .",
    "the lack of sources with strongly peaked 10  @xmath1 m features ( and therefore small grains ) in the substantial sample observed here is consistent with this fast timescale for grain growth ( to 1  @xmath1 m sizes ) .",
    "the presence of strongly peaked 10  @xmath1 m features in some sources ( particularly in the @xmath59 sample ) may be indicative of the replenishment of small grains in disk surface layers through mechanisms such as fragmentation and/or turbulent mixing .",
    "( some amount of large grains will also be mixed into disk surface layers ) .",
    "the models presented in @xcite suggest that such mechanisms may allow disk systems to maintain quasi - stationary grain size distributions , with grain growth and small - grain replenishment rates in equilibrium for long periods of time ( @xmath1171 myr ) .",
    "thus the typical grain sizes found in disks around pre - main sequence stars are likely not to be directly related to disk age , but indicative of a number of other factors , such as the strength of the turbulence and the gas mass in the disk .",
    "we also do not see a correlation of the strength - shape trend with the equivalent width of the h@xmath2 emission lines ( h@xmath2ew ) , probing disk evolution ( figure  [ fig : vbprop]c ) .",
    "the h@xmath2 equivalent width is a tracer of active stellar accretion from the inner disk .",
    "thus clearing of the inner disk will result in lower h@xmath2ew . in figure  [ fig : vbprop]c , we separate the tts in our sample into two groups using the equivalent width of h@xmath2 : 35 classical t  tauri stars ( ctts ; h@xmath118ew  @xmath119  @xmath120 ) and 14 weak - lined t  tauri stars ( wtts ; h@xmath118ew  @xmath121  @xmath120 ) . although there is no clear observational evidence that ctts are progenitors to wtts , wtts are often described as ctts in which the inner disk has dissipated . therefore , we might expect that the clearing of the inner disk , and thus the transition between the classical and weak - line t  tauri star phases , would be related to grain growth and the 10  @xmath1 m feature strength - shape trend .",
    "we find that there is a high probability ( @xmath070% ) that the two groups are drawn from the same distribution , however , indicating that there is no clear relationship between h@xmath2ew and grain growth in these disks .",
    "this indicates that either h@xmath2ew is not a good probe of the disk evolutionary state or stellar accretion rate or that grain growth is not related to these quantities .",
    "we also note that h@xmath118 emission can be quite variable and the values used here are time averages , using the full range of observed h@xmath118ew as error bars .",
    "the relation between h@xmath118ew and silicate feature shape - strength would more precisely tested with simultaneous mir and optical spectroscopy .",
    "spectra in the @xmath0535  @xmath1 m region have been obtained for disks around 40 tts and 7 haebe stars using the spitzer space telescope , as a subset of the c2d irs survey .",
    "this is the first significant sample of t  tauri stars for which both 10 and 20  @xmath1 m features are available .",
    "broad silicate features at 10 and 20  @xmath1 m , similar to emission from amorphous silicates , are prominent toward the observed sample of tts and haebe stars . emission features from crystalline silicates",
    "are also evident in the observed spectra , with the most prominent features visible in the 33 - 36  @xmath1 m region .        if the full irs spectra are considered , the data are most consistent with source - to - source variations in grain size , with the bulk of the sources in our sample indicating sizes of 1  @xmath1 m or greater .",
    "this and the lack of strongly peaked 10  @xmath1 m sources in our sample of 40 sources is consistent with fast grain growth ( from 0.11.0  @xmath1 m sizes ) in the surfaces of these disks .    long wavelength ( 33 - 36  @xmath1 m ) crystalline silicate features are seen toward @xmath0half of the tts disks in our sample .",
    "this indicates that significant dust processing is also occuring in these disks .",
    "only 13 of these spectra also exhibit 11.3-to-9.8  @xmath1 m ratios that can not be reproduced by models of amorphous silicates , suggesting that the degree of crystallinity deduced from the 10  @xmath1 m region alone is underestimated .",
    "a subset of the observed spectra have particularly large 10-to-20  @xmath1 m ratios , which can only be reproduced with much smaller grains emitting at 10  @xmath1 m ( @xmath122  @xmath1 m ) than at 20  @xmath1 m ( @xmath123  @xmath1 m ) .",
    "this can be explained if the 20  @xmath1 m emission arises from deeper in the disk than the 10  @xmath1 m emission in disks where dust settling has occurred .",
    "the 10  @xmath1 m feature strength vs. shape trend _ is not _ correlated with age or disk evolutionary state ( h@xmath2ew ) .",
    "this suggests the importance of turbulence and the regeneration of small ( @xmath1m - sized ) grains on the disk surface .    the 10  @xmath1 m feature strength vs. shape trend _",
    "is _ related to spectral type , with m stars showing significantly flatter silicate features ( larger grain sizes ) than those of a / b stars .",
    "this may be related to a difference in the radius probed by the emission , which should increase as a function of the disk temperature , and thus stellar luminosity .",
    "however , the observed correlation could also be indicative of other spectral - type dependent factors ( e.g , x - rays , uv radiation , stellar / disk winds , etc . ) .",
    "as the observed features arise from silicate emission in the disk surface layers , and the largest grains will gravitationally settle to the disk midplane , the emitting grains likely represent the small - size tail of the silicate grain size distribution within the disk .",
    "this simple picture of grain growth and settling is complicated by vertical mixing , which can bring both large and small grains back to the disk surface , and fragmentation , which results in the replenishment of small grains throughout the disk .",
    "comparisons with probes of grain size in the disk midplane and inner disk clearing , as well as probes of disk turbulence and gas - dust interactions , are vital to understanding the results presented here in the context of planet formation .",
