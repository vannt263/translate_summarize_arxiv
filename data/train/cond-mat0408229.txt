    "the possibility of the states in which the dissipative electric current in a nonequilibrium electron system ( a system in which a majority of electrons have negative effective mass ) flows in the direction opposite to the electric field , i.e. , the usual ( or absolute ) conductivity of the system is negative , was discussed by kroemer in the late 50s  @xcite .",
    "rather realistic mechanisms of such an absolute negative conductivity ( anc ) in two- and three - dimensional substantially nonequilibrium electron systems ( 2dess and 3dess ) in magnetic field were considered more than three decades ago  @xcite . at the same time , the mechanism of anc in a 2des subjected to magnetic field and irradiated with microwaves associated with impurity scattering of 2d electrons accompanied by the absorption of microwave photons was proposed by one of us  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the dissipative conductivity is an oscillatory function of the ratio of the microwave frequency @xmath0 to the electron cyclotron frequency @xmath1 . at @xmath0 somewhat exceeding @xmath1 or a multiple of @xmath1 , the photon - assisted impurity scattering of 2d electrons with their transitions between the landau levels ( lls ) results in a contribution to the dissipative current flowing opposite to the electric field . at sufficiently strong microwave radiation",
    ", this scattering mechanism can dominate leading to anc when @xmath2 , where @xmath3 the transformation of the dissipative current vs electric field characteristic is schematically shown in fig.1 .     without ( @xmath4 ) and with ( @xmath5 ) microwave irradiation.,width=264 ]     and @xmath6 and ( b ) photon - assisted acoustic phonon scattering mechanisms ( only transitions for @xmath7 are shown).,width=302 ]    the effect of vanishing electrical resistance ( in the hall bar configuration ) and of vanishing electrical conductance ( in the corbino configuration ) in a 2des in magnetic field irradiated with microwaves has recently been observed by mani _",

    "according to anderson and brinkman  @xcite , andreev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and volkov and co - workers  @xcite    suggested that this effect , i.e. , the appearance of zr - states ( and zc - states ) , is attributed to anc associated with photon - assisted impurity scattering of 2d electrons ( put forward in  @xcite ) and an instability of homogeneous states in a conductive media with anc .",
    "the latter was noted by zakharov  @xcite and discussed in early papers on anc in 2dess ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of the electric - field distributions corresponding to zr- and zc - states arisen as a result of the instability is determined by the shape of the current - voltage characteristic ( in particular , by the value of @xmath8 ) and the features of the diffusion processes .",
    "recent experimental findings  @xcite have stimulated a surge of experimental  ( for example ,  @xcite ) and theoretical papers ( for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "preliminary brief overviews can be found in  @xcite . in particular , the results of early theoretical studies of anc caused by photon - assisted impurity scattering were generalized by the inclusions of the ll broadening and high microwave power effects  @xcite .",
    "a quasi - classical model which is valid at large filling factors and sufficiently strong electric field ( or when a long - range disorder determines the dissipative current ) was developed by vavilov and aleiner  @xcite .",
    "possible role of photon - assisted acoustic phonon scattering was discussed in  @xcite .    a theoretical model for zr- and zc - states should explain at least the following details observed experimentally : ( a ) the phase of the magnetic - field dependence of the resistance ( dissipative conductivity ) , i.e. , the positions of maxima and minima , ( b ) very slow dependence of the magnitude of the dissipative conductivity maxima and minima on the microwave power ( tending to saturation in the range of elevated powers ) , ( c ) steep decrease in the maxima and minima magnitude resulting in vanishing of anc and , hence , in vanishing zr- and zc - states with increasing temperature , and ( d ) relatively small magnitude of the minima and maxima in 2dess with moderate electron mobility that makes impossible the attainment of anc and its consequences .    in this letter",
    ", we discuss a scenario for the appearance of zero - resistance ( zr ) as well as zero - conductance ( zc ) states in 2dess invoking the concept of anc associated with photon - assisted impurity scattering complicated by electron - electron interaction and photon - assisted acoustic phonon scattering .",
    "the proposed scenario provides plausible explanations of main experimental facts .",
    "the effect of anc in a 2des system in magnetic field under microwave irradiation is associated with the following  @xcite .",
    "the dissipative electron transport in the direction parallel to the electric field and perpendicular to the magnetic field is due to hops of the electron larmor orbit centers caused by scattering processes .",
    "these hops result in a change in the electron potential energy @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the dc electric force acting on an electron which is determined by the net in - plane dc electric field including both the applied and the hall components , and @xmath11 is the displacement of the electron orbit center .",
    "if the electron orbit center displaces in the direction of the electric force ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , the electron potential energy decreases . in equilibrium , the electron orbit center hops in this direction are dominant , so the dissipative electron current flows in the direction of the net dc electric field .",
    "however , in some cases , the displacements of the electron orbit centers in the direction opposite to the electric force ( with @xmath14 and , hence , @xmath15 ) can prevail resulting in the dissipative current flowing opposite to the electric field .",
    "indeed , if an electron absorbs a photon and transfers to a higher ll , a portion of the absorbed energy @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the planck constant ) goes to an increase of the electron kinetic energy , hence , the change in the electron potential energy is @xmath18 . if @xmath19 , so that @xmath20 ( see fig.2a ) , the potential energy of electrons increases with each act of their scattering .",
    "summarizing the results of previous calculations  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , the variation of the dissipative dc current under the effect of microwave radiation ( photocurrent ) can be presented as @xmath21 ^ 2}\\ ] ] if @xmath22 , @xmath23\\ ] ] when @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and @xmath26 when @xmath24 and @xmath27 ( smooth disorder ) .",
    "here @xmath28 the electron charge , @xmath29 is the ll broadening , @xmath30 is the magnetic length , @xmath31 is the spacing between 2des and the donor sheet , @xmath32 is the hall drift velocity , @xmath33 is the mcdonald function , and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the electron temperature .",
    "factor @xmath36 is due to the contribution of scattering processes with both absorption and emission of microwave photons . coefficients @xmath37 are determined by the matrix elements of photon - assisted interaction of electrons with impurities ( remote ones and those in 2des ) and surface roughness as well as by the amplitude of the ac microwave electric field @xmath38 and the electron distribution function . as follows from  ( 1 ) -",
    "( 3 ) , the microwave photocurrent reaches the maxima at @xmath39 and minima at @xmath40 with @xmath41 . according to  ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) , the net dissipative",
    "current approximately coincides with its dark value at the resonances @xmath42 . at @xmath40 and sufficiently strong microwave radiation ( when @xmath43 ) ,",
    "the net dissipative dc current @xmath44 becomes directed opposite to the electric field resulting in the instability .",
    "this pattern of the oscillatory behavior of the microwave photocurrent is in line with qualitative reasonings in the previous section .",
    "it is consistent with the experimental results  @xcite .",
    "as shown , the photon - assisted acoustic phonon scattering processes ( see fig.2b ) also lead to an oscillatory dependence of the microwave photoconductivity .",
    "however , the phase of these oscillations is opposite to that in the case of photon - assisted impurity scattering  @xcite .",
    "this can add complexity to the microwave photoconductivity oscillations and can even result in their suppression , particularly , at elevated temperatures ( see sec .",
    "the dependence of the factor @xmath37 microwave field is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the bessel function and @xmath47 is proportional to the amplitude of classical oscillations of the electron orbit center in the microwave field ( see , for example  @xcite ) .",
    "the terms with @xmath48 correspond to the transitions with the absorption and emission of @xmath49 real microwave photons .",
    "thus , the magnitudes of the microwave photoconductivity maxima and minima @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , are generally nonlinear functions of the microwave power @xmath53 .",
    "this is due to the effect of virtual photons absorption and emission on the electron scattering processes . at low microwave powers , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "however , when @xmath47 approaches @xmath56 , where @xmath56 corresponds to maximum value of @xmath46 , the magnitude of @xmath50 fairly slow increases with microwave power @xmath57 in line with experimental observations  @xcite and others .",
    "this occurs at such powers that the amplitude of classical oscillations of the electron orbit center in the microwave field becomes of the order of @xmath30 .",
    "the pertinent characteristic power @xmath58 increases with @xmath0 approximately as @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "another consequence of the nonlinear mechanism in question is that at high microwave powers the magnitudes of maxima and minima corresponding to higher resonances ( @xmath60 with @xmath61 ) are not too small compared to those near the cyclotron resonance(@xmath62 ) .",
    "slowing down of the increase in @xmath50 and @xmath51 with increasing microwave power can be also associated with some heating of the 2des .",
    "as shown below , an increase in the electron temperature leads to broadening of the ll and , consequently , to smearing of the resonances .",
    "as seen from ( 1 ) , the microwave photoconductivity @xmath63 markedly decreases due to the processes with emission of microwave photons .",
    "this effect becomes essential when the electron temperature increases from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "the microwave photoconductivity maxima and minima also strongly depend on the ll broadening .",
    "the latter can be rather sensitive to the temperature .",
    "in particular , at moderate microwave powers @xmath57 , for the lorentzian shape of the lls , one obtains the following temperature dependence : @xmath66 here the dark conductivity and photoconductivity stem from the scattering processes involving inpurities , while the value @xmath63 depends on the sharpness of the resonances and , hence , on the net ll broadening .",
    "the net ll broadening is determined by the impurity ( and roughness ) scattering processes and by the electron - electron interaction .",
    "the ll broadening due to electron - electron interaction steeply increases with the electron temperature . taking into account that in the experimental situations the 2des fermi energy @xmath67 , one can use the following temperature dependence  @xcite : @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the effective rydberg . for @xmath70  ghz ,",
    "the factor associated with the emission of microwave photons in  ( 4 ) reduces approximately by half with the temperature increasing from 1  k to 3 - 4  k. setting @xmath71  mev , we find that @xmath72 . hence , according to ( 4 ) , in a 2des with high electron mobility ( in the absence of magnetic field ) in which @xmath29 is determined primarily by the electron - electron scattering so that @xmath73 , the span of the dissipative conductivity oscillations , i.e. , the values @xmath50 and @xmath51 can decrease by several orders of magnitude when the temperature increases by a few k. however , in 2dess with moderate electron mobility ( limited , say , by residual impurities and interface roughness ) in which @xmath74 , an increase in @xmath29 with increasing temperature and , hence , a decrease in @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be less pronounced as confirmed by experimental data .    since photon - assisted acoustic phonon scattering provides the microwave photoconductivity maxima and minima at @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , i.e. , approximately at the point where photon - assisted impurity scattering yields , on the contrary , the microwave photoconductivity minima and maxima , the former mechanism can interfere with the latter one modifying the oscillations and even effectively suppressing them",
    "this is possible if photon - assisted acoustic phonon scattering becomes essential with increasing temperature  @xcite .",
    "a marked intensification of this mechanism occurs when @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the speed of sound . in the experimental situations , @xmath79  k.",
    "although the oscillations of microwave photoconductivity as a function of the cyclotron frequency ( i.e. , the magnetic field ) were observed in 2dess with the electron mobility in rather wide range , sufficiently deep microwave photoconductivity minima which can result in anc were observed only in the samples with fairly high electron mobility . in the framework of the model under consideration , this can be explain as follows .",
    "the relative amplitude of the microwave photoconductivity oscillations is very sensitive to the ll broadening . in sufficiently perfect 2dess with weak scattering of electrons on residual impurities immediately in the 2des and on the interface roughness , the ll",
    "broadening is determined primarily by the electron - electron interaction .",
    "indeed , when the electron sheet concentration @xmath80 is about the sheet concentration of remote impurities @xmath81 , the ratio of quantities @xmath82 and @xmath83 can be estimated roughly as @xmath84 .",
    "the exponential factor in this formula is due a spatial separation of electrons and donors which gives rise to an exponential decrease in the matrix element of electron - impurity interaction .",
    "hence , at @xmath85 , one obtains @xmath86 . in the experiments with 2dess having high electron mobility , @xmath87 , so that the latter exponential factor is about of 0.06 .",
    "since the electron - electron scattering processes are effectively suppressed with decreasing temperature  @xcite , the microwave maxima and , what is more important , minima are well pronounced and can surpass the dark conductivity at low temperatures and when the microwave radiation is strong enough .",
    "this leads to anc in some ranges of magnetic field when certain relations between @xmath0 and @xmath1 are met .",
    "in contrast , in the samples with moderate electron mobility , a significant contribution to the ll broadening is provided by residual impurities and interface roughness .",
    "this prevents the attainment of a sufficiently large ratio @xmath88 necessary for anc .",
    "we believe that main experimental facts on zr- and zc - states and related effects can be explained in the framework of the concept based on anc caused by photon - assisted impurity scattering of electrons and affected by electron - electron and photon - assisted acoustic phonon interactions .",
