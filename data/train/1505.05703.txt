    "the strong and hard ( @xmath49 ) ( epic - pn ) powerlaw and a weak disk component are typical of black hole x - ray binaries in the hard state .",

    "the apparent inner disk radius @xmath26 inferred from the diskbb component is related to the realistic inner disk radius @xmath55 by @xmath56 @xcite where @xmath57 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the ratio of colour temperature to effective temperature , and @xmath58 is a correction factor to account for the fact that the maximum disk temperature @xmath59 , occurs at a radius slightly larger than the actual inner radius @xmath55 .",

    "it is difficult to directly compare the different spectral parameters from previous works on this source owing to the different spectral models used for the analysis .",

    "the photon index ( @xmath0 ) from the analysis of both observations is consistent with previous estimates from _ suzaku _ data by ap09 .",

    "ap09 ascribes the difference to effects from instrumental cross - calibration .",
    "also , the source being close to the galactic centre , possible contamination from the galactic background may affect spectral analysis of data from _",

    "indeed the neutron star swift  j1749.42807 ( within @xmath63 radius of igr  j174972821 ) was also active during this period as reported by @xcite .",
    "however , the qualitative trend for the results from different instruments is similar , and the @xmath28 was nearly constant during the outburst .",
    "_ suzaku _ and _ chandra _ observations showed the evidence of an accretion disk with inner disk temperature @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , as reported in ap09 and ap07 respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the value obtained for our analysis of the two _ xmm - newton _ observations ( @xmath66 ) . to compare with previous results ,",
    "we have computed the apparent inner disk radius assuming an inclination angle of @xmath67 and distance @xmath68 .",
    "we found @xmath69 and @xmath70 for obs 1 and obs 2 , respectively . comparing the results we find that the radii estimated from the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations are close in value , within errors , whereas that from the _ suzaku _ data on 25th , september is lower than the above estimates , indicating the formation of an accretion disk",
    ". however , the discrepancy could also be be due to different models and energy bands used for calculation of disk radius with different instruments .",
    "the _ rxte / pca _ light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig.pcu2 ] ) shows a monotonic variation in the count rate .",
    "[ param_var ] shows that the @xmath71 flux measured with _",
    "suzaku _ is significantly lower by @xmath72 than that measured with _",
    "rxte_/pca on the same day .",
    "this difference is likely to be due to the uncertainties in the absolute flux calibration of _ rxte_/pca and the burst and window modes of _ suzaku_/xiss .",
    "the lower inner radius measured with the _ suzaku _ data may be due to the lower diskbb normalization which in turn may be related to the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration .",
    "the lowest panel of fig .",
    "[ param_var ] shows the variation of the flux scaled to the @xmath33 energy band , calculated from the reported best fit model parameters by rw07 , jr07 , ap07 and ap09 .",
    "flux of the source shows gradual decrease with time with the flux on 2006 october 01 ( ap07 ) being nearly 20 times lower than that at the beginning on 2006 september 19 .",
    "we have presented the variation of hardness ratio ( ratio of counts in @xmath34 to @xmath35 energy bands ) as defined in ) with the average pcu2 counts ( @xmath73 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig.hid ] .",
    "the source is clearly seen to have hardness @xmath74 throughout the outburst . from the overall results of the spectral analysis",
    ", the source appears to stay in the hard state during its entire outburst with @xmath75 .",
    "although differing in frequency and energy range , the full band ( @xmath76 ) pds derived from the timing mode epic - pn data are similar to that obtained from the _ rxte _ data performed by @xcite ( jr07 ) . as in jr07 , we require three lorentzian components to fit the pds ( low frequency noise component ( lfn ) , mid - frequency noise component ( mfn ) and high frequency noise component ( hfn ) for @xmath77 hz ) . such broad features is typical of black hole binaries ( e.g. cyg x-1 and gx  3394  @xcite ) .",
    "characteristic frequencies of lfn , hfn and mfn are consistent with the jr07 . for same frequency ( 0.01 - 40hz ) and energy ( 2 - 10kev ) range ,",
    "the fit parameters of the lfn , mfn and hfn are similar for both the rxte and xmm observations .",
    "however the integrated rms for the xmm data was found to be @xmath78 , larger than that of the rxte ( @xmath79 ) .    based on our energy dependent timing analysis of _ xmm - newton _ and _ rxte _ , we find that the timing behaviour of igr  j174972821 strongly depends on the energy band .",
    "the mfn feature is not present in the low energy band ( 0.3 - 2 kev ( xmm - newton ) , 2 - 5 kev ( rxte ) ) , which could be due to poor signal to noise ratio in this band but variation of rms is found to be strongly dependent on energy bands .",
    "softer energy bands had higher fractional rms e.g. rms of the energy band @xmath80 of _ xmm - newton _ data was nearly @xmath6 times that of the energy bands 2 - 5 and 5 - 10 kev . however , at higher energies , the rms variability was found to to increase with energy .",
    "such a behaviour though typical for blackholes in high / soft state @xcite , is not common for sources in hard state .",
    "increased variability at higher energy in the hard state of some sources e.g. 1e  1740.7 - 2942 and cyg x-1 have been reported by @xcite .    also , we see from fig",
    ".  [ rmsvar ] , that the magnitude of the rms variability is lower for _ rxte _ observations than that of _ xmm _ data . a possible reason for the above could be increase of the mean flux due to contribution from the galactic ridge emission to the _ rxte _ data ( see sec .",
    "[ ref.append ] ) .",
    "although the accreting milli - second pulsar swift  j1749.42807 , within the rxte field of view of igr  j174972821 , was also present in outburst at the same time @xcite , its flux was @xmath81 3000 times less than that of igr j17497 - 2821 , could not have contributed to the background .",

    "_ rxte_/pca being a non - imaging detector with a large field of view , is more susceptible to contamination from background x - ray flux due to the galactic ridge emission , as opposed to _ xmm - newton_. excess background can lower the net observed fractional rms variability ( rms / mean ) .",
    "following @xcite if we consider the _ rxte _ obsid 30185 - 01 - 20 - 00 to represent the galactic background emission , the mean count rate of the background emission then was found to be @xmath82 counts  s@xmath51 in the 2 - 10 kev band . using the webpimms tool , we find the equivalent rxte / pca count rate of the 2 - 10  kev flux of igr j17497 - 2821 measured with xmm - newton to be 51 counts s@xmath51 .",
