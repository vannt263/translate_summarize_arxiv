    "it is well known that normal discs of spiral galaxies have a component which can be fitted to an exponential ( freeman , 1970 ) with a radial scale length @xmath6 .",
    "there are two basic reasons to undertake a new determination of the parameter @xmath6 in the milky way :    \\a ) there is a very large scatter in the values found in the literature .",
    "for instance , kent , dame and fanzio ( 1991 ) after reviewing previously reported values , found that they range from 1 to 5.5 kpc , and proposed an intermediate value of 3 kpc .",
    "van der kruit ( 1986 ) obtained 5.5 kpc ; lewis and freeman ( 1989 ) gave a value of 2.5 kpc , and so did robin , crez and mohan ( 1992 ) , among others .",
    "this uncertainty is also too large in the nir .",
    "mikami and ishida ( 1981 ) obtained a value of 1 kpc , jones et al .",
    "( 1981 ) 2 kpc , and eaton et al .",
    "( 1984 ) 3 kpc .",
    "values of @xmath6 in the nir seem to be lower , but even this fact remains uncertain , despite its interest in the dynamic evolution of the disc .",
    "\\b ) even if @xmath6 is simply a fitting parameter for a distribution with frequent deviations from an exponential , it has became a natural radial length unit , very useful when comparing spiral galaxies with different sizes or unknown distances , and physically more significant than true length of angle units .",
    "the position of any morphological feature or typical lengths of disc phenomena are usually and hopefully expressed taking @xmath6 as unit .",
    "some of these features in our own galaxy may be considered normal or exceptional depending on the value of this normalizing length .",
    "probably the large scatter of data is a result of managing a large amount of data concerning different regions of the sky , which are difficult to analyse because of the contribution of many other complex components , such as bulge , star formation ring associated with the gas ring , bar , spiral arms , warp and so on .",
    "however , a proper choice of the wavelength and the region of the sky may render this problem a very simple one , which implies a more confident obtention of the parameter @xmath6    this search specifically deals with , and aims at an improved determination of the radial scale length of the milky way disc .    we have chosen the k - band , in which extinction is very low .",
    "this also implies that the observed distribution closely resembles the true one .",
    "in addition , we have taken measurements at @xmath7 , rendering extinction negligible .",
    "we then surveyed a galactic longitude range from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "this practically eliminates the contribution of bulge , ring and bar ( hammersley et al . , 1994 ) which take place for @xmath8 , and the contribution of the local arm , warp and truncation ( porcel et al . , 1997 ) , which take place for @xmath9 .",
    "the contribution of the other spiral arms ( not the local arm ) is minimized taking @xmath7 , as they remain closer to the plane .",
    "another advantage of working in the k - band is that the observed stars in the 9 - 10 magnitude range are practically only k2-k5 iii stars , through the surveyed sky zone .",
    "this fact was realised after taking into account the previous analyses of ruelas - mayorga ( 1991 ) , wainscoat et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , calbet et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and our own initial calculations ( porcel , 1997 ) .",
    "the light coming from these stars is 80 % of the total light from all stars in this magnitude range .",
    "this greatly simplifies the problem as the luminosity function can be approximated by a dirac s delta function .",
    "observations were carried out with the carlos snchez 1.5 m telescope at the teide observatory , as part of the two micron galactic survey ( tmgs ) project ( garzn et al . , 1993 ; hammersley et al . , 1994",
    "; calbet et al . ,",
    "interpolation techniques were used to obtain a regular mesh from the series of discrete scans ( porcel , 1997 ; porcel et al . 1997 ) .",
    "as explained above we consider k2-k5 iii stars .",
    "the luminosity function @xmath10 is defined as usual , i. e. @xmath11 gives the number of stars per @xmath12 with an absolute k magnitude in the interval @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "it is here approximated by a dirac s function , i. e. @xmath14 centred at @xmath15 .",
    "its true dispersion is only 0.6 mag .",
    "the effect of a non - vanishing dispersion on absolute magnitude could be important , as the resulting value for the scale length could be affected by some sort of malmquist bias .",
    "we have performed several numerical calculations using a gaussian distribution for the luminosity function , obtaining similar results .",
    "the final value of the estimated error is not affected either , as it mainly arises from the fitting process .",
    "even though these kind of effects are difficult to evaluate , the approximation of the luminosity function by a @xmath16 was found to be a satisfactory assumption . in the fundamental equation of",
    "star counts ( e. g. mihalas and binney , 1981 ; gilmore and reid , 1983 ; calbet et al . , 1995 )",
    "the density function is also taken into account .",
    "it was assumed that : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the density function , i. e. the number density of stars taking its local value as unit , @xmath19 is the galactocentric distance , and @xmath20 is the vertical coordinate .",
    "we take @xmath21 .",
    "the vertical exponential profile and the value of @xmath22 were adopted from wainscoat et al .",
    "we have repeated these calculations for different values of @xmath23 and we have obtained similar results , i. e. neither the proposed value of @xmath6 nor its estimated error are affected . actually @xmath6 is found to be noticeably independent of @xmath23 .",
    "we therefore think that this choice for @xmath23 can not be an important source of errors .    defining as usual @xmath24 , as the number of stars per squared degree with magnitude between 9 and 10 , the fundamental equation of star counts becomes @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the solid angle",
    ", @xmath27 is a constant and @xmath28 is the distance from the sun .",
    "this expression is easily transformed into @xmath29 where @xmath30 @xmath31 is another constant , and @xmath32    as @xmath33 is taken to be constant , @xmath34 is a function only of @xmath35 , and therefore @xmath36 is a function only of @xmath35 .",
    "equation ( [ eq3 ] ) predicts a linear function relation between @xmath37 and @xmath34 .",
    "the results are plotted in figure [ fig1 ] . in this figure ,",
    "error bars represent poisson errors . after fitting ( using a standard chi - squared method as described in press et al . , 1992 )",
    ", we obtained @xmath38",
    "the value we propose , @xmath39 has been obtained by choosing the most appropriate conditions for this task .",
    "this value is similar to typical values for other galaxies ( de grijs and van der kruit , 1996 ; peletier et al . , 1994 ;",
    "de jong , 1996 ) .",
    "this value seems quite low when compared with the obtained values in the optical ( see for instance van der kruit , 1986 ; and barteldress and dettmar , 1994 ) but it is well known than the exponential scale lengths decrease with increasing wavelength ( de grijs and van der kruit , 1996 ; peletier et al . , 1994 ; de jong 1996 , tully et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "peletier et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found that the ratio @xmath40 is in the range 1.2 - 2 in a sample of 37 sb s and sc s edge - on galaxies , with this ratio increasing with axis ratio , showing that it is an effect that is mostly due to extinction . in this case",
    "our determination of the radial scale length of the milky way is compatible with values in optical bands as large as 4 kpc .",
    "our value is virtually free of extinction effects , so it is a proper determination of the true scale length of the mass distribution of the milky way disc .",
    "a similar value ( @xmath41 kpc ) has been obtained by ruphy et al .",
    "fux and martinet used indirect methods based on the asymmetric drift equation , and also obtained a similar value ( @xmath42 kpc ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that with respect to the radial scale length , our galaxy is a typical one .",
