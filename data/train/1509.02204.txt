    "we consider the charged polymer chain introduced in kantor and kardar  @xcite .",
    "the polymer chain is modelled by the path of a simple random walk on @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "each monomer in the polymer chain carries a _ random electric charge _ , drawn in an i.i.d .  fashion from @xmath2 .",
    "each self - intersection of the polymer chain contributes an energy that is equal to the product of the charges of the two monomers that meet ( i.e. , a negative energy when the charges have opposite sign and a positive energy when the charges have the same sign ) .",
    "the polymer chain has a probability distribution on path space that is given by the _ gibbs measure _ associated with the energy .",
    "our goal is to study the scaling properties of the polymer as its length tends to infinity .",
    "very little is known mathematically about the _",
    "quenched _ version of the model , where the charges are frozen .",
    "the two main questions of interest are :    * is the free energy self - averaging in the disorder ? * is there a phase transition from a ` collapsed phase ' to an ` extended phase ' at some critical value of the temperature ?",
    "we expect that the answer to ( 1 ) is yes and the answer to ( 2 ) is no .",
    "all we are able to show is the following ( see appendix  [ appb ] ) :    * if the average charge is non - zero , then the number of different sites visited by the polymer is proportional to its length . * in @xmath3",
    ", if the average charge is sufficiently positive or negative and the temperature is sufficiently low , then the polymer behaves ballistically .",
    "we expect that in any @xmath1 the scaling of the polymer is similar to that of the _ self - avoiding walk _ when the average charge is non - zero .",
    "we further expect that the polymer is subdiffusive when the average charge is zero .",
    "all these problems remains open .    in the present paper we focus on the _ annealed _ version of the model , where the charges are averaged out",
    "this version , which we study in @xmath3 only , is easier to deal with , yet turns out to exhibit a very rich scaling behavior .",

    "the latter corresponds to an inhomogeneous strategy for the polymer to realise a large deviation .",
    "we identify the scaling of the free energy in the limit of small average charge and small inverse temperature , which exhibits anomalous behaviour .",
