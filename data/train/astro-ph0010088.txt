    "observed bright elliptical galaxies ( begs ) have the common interesting properties , which are expected to provide strong constraints on their formation scenario .",
    "for example , davies et al .  ( 1983 ) found that the ratios of the rotation velocity to the velocity dispersion , @xmath0 , of begs are much smaller than those of faint ellipticals .",
    "in photometric properties , the light profile of begs is well described by the de vaucouleurs law , whereas faint ellipticals usually have an exponential light profile ( e.g. , caon , capaccioli , & donofrio 1993 ) .    on the other hand",
    ", kawata ( 1999 ) showed that in the cdm universe , i.e. , the hierarchical clustering scenario , elliptical galaxies can be formed from a low - spin overdense region , using numerical simulation which includes almost all the important physical processes in galaxy formation self - consistently .",
    "he adopted a semi - cosmological model proposed by katz & gunn ( 1991 ) . in this model ,",
    "the process of galaxy formation is mimicked by a collapse of a top - hat over - dense sphere ( a seed galaxy ) which initially follows a hubble flow expansion and has a solid - body rotation as an effect of the external tidal field .",
    "the amount of the initial solid body rotation is specified by a dimensionless spin parameter , @xmath1 ( peebles 1971 ) .",
    "in addition , small - scale density fluctuations expected in the cdm universe are superposed on this sphere which consists of dark and baryonic matter . using this model , katz & gunn ( 1991 ) , katz ( 1992 ) , and",
    "steinmetz & mller ( 1994 , 1995 ) studied only the case of @xmath2 and seemed to succeed in forming a system which has similar properties to an observed disk galaxy in several respects ( see also koda , sofue , & wada 2000a ; 2000b , who presented , in the same way , that disk - like systems are formed for a range of @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , the spin parameter of the virialized dark matter falls in a range 0.020.11 with a median value of 0.05 , according to the results of n - body simulations ( e.g. , barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; warren et al .  1992 ) and analytical works ( e.g. , steinmetz & bartelmann 1995 ; eisenstein & loeb 1995 ) , in which @xmath2 is near a high - end value . kawata ( 1999 ) studied the evolution of a seed galaxy which has a slow rotation corresponding to @xmath4 and showed that the end - product reproduces the observed properties of elliptical galaxies very well .",
    "cosmologically , a small spin - parameter is preferred in a galactic halo collapsing at a high redshift ( heavens & peacock 1988 ) .",
    "moreover , elliptical galaxies are considered to be a system whose stellar component is old and rotates slowly .",
    "thus , it is a quite natural consideration that most elliptical galaxies were formed in a halo collapsing at high redshift and rotating slowly .",
    "kawata s study was based on the hierarchical clustering scenario , because in his simulation the galaxy forms through mergers of sub - clumps caused by initial small - scale density fluctuations ( see fig .  1 of kawata 1999 ) .",
    "the question we have to ask here is how the clustering of sub - clumps acts on the formation of elliptical galaxies from a low - spin seed galaxy . in order to understand further the role of the clustering , we compare the evolution of a low - spin seed galaxy including small - scale density perturbations with that of a uniform one , as the opposite case .",
    "then , we focus on massive seed galaxies , and examine whether both types of seed galaxy can reproduce the observed properties of begs quantitatively , because the properties of begs , as mentioned above , are expected to be able to provide constraints on their formation scenario . if the uniform low - spin seed galaxy also succeeds in forming a system similar to begs , small - scale density fluctuations superposed on the initial slow - rotating sphere will not be indispensable to the model .",
    "the present study will thus clarify the role of the clustering of the sub - clumps induced by small - scale density fluctuations in galaxy formation from a massive low - spin seed galaxy .",
    "the plan for the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section 2 , the numerical method and the model",
    "are described .",
    "section 3 presents results of numerical simulations .",
    "conclusion is described in section 4 .",
    "details of our code are described in kawata ( 1999 ) .",
    "it is essentially based on the treesph ( hernquist & katz 1989 ; katz , weinberg , & hernquist 1996 ) , which combines the tree algorithm ( barnes & hut 1986 ) for the computation of the gravitational forces with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ; lucy 1977 ; gingold & monaghan 1977 ) approach to numerical hydrodynamics .",
    "the dynamics of the dark matter and stars is calculated by the n - body scheme , and the gas component is modeled using the sph .",
    "it is fully lagrangian , three - dimensional , and highly adaptive in space and time owing to individual smoothing lengths and individual time steps .",
    "it self - consistently includes almost all the important physical processes in galaxy formation , such as self - gravity , hydrodynamics , radiative cooling , star formation , supernova feedback , and metal enrichment .    the radiative cooling which depends on the metallicity ( theis , burkert , & hensler 1992 ) is taken into account . the cooling rate of a gas with the solar metallicity is larger than that for a gas of the primordial composition by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "thus , the cooling by metals should not be ignored in numerical simulations of galaxy formation ( kellander & hultman 1998 ; kay et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the star formation occurs where the gas density is greater than a critical density , @xmath5 , and the gas velocity field is convergent .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a dimensionless sfr parameter and @xmath8 is the dynamical time , which is longer than the cooling time in the region eligible to form stars .",
    "this formula corresponds to a schmidt law in which sfr is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "we apply a salpeter imf with the lower mass limit of @xmath10 and the upper mass limit of @xmath11 .",
    "after stars have formed , the massive stars ( @xmath12 ) die immediately , accompanied by supernova explosions which inject thermal energy and metals to the surrounding gas .",
    "we adopt the same stellar nucleosynthesis yields as kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) .",
    "type ia supernovae are not taken into account in this paper .",
    "we use the models which are almost the same as kawata ( 1999 ) .",
    "we consider an isolated sphere as a seed galaxy and compare the two models whose initial conditions are different .",
    "the only one difference between the two models is whether small - scale density fluctuations following a cdm power spectrum are superimposed on the initial isolated sphere ( hereafter model 1 ) or not ( hereafter model 2 ) . in model 1",
    "the small - scale cdm density fluctuations are generated by bertschinger s software cosmics ( bertschinger 1995 ) .",
    "to incorporate the effects of fluctuations with longer wavelengths , the density of the initial sphere has been enhanced and a rigid rotation corresponding to a spin parameter , @xmath1 , has been added .",
    "the initial condition is determined by four parameters @xmath1 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 : the spin parameter is defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total angular momentum of the system , @xmath18 is the total energy , and @xmath13 is the total mass of this sphere , which is initially composed of dark matter and gas ; @xmath14 is defined only in model 1 and specifies an rms mass fluctuation in a sphere of radius @xmath19 mpc , which normalizes the amplitude of the cdm power spectrum ; @xmath20 is the expected collapse redshift . if the top - hat density perturbation has an amplitude of @xmath21 at an initial redshift , @xmath22 , we obtain @xmath23 approximately ( e.g. , padmanabhan 1993 ) .",
    "thus , when @xmath15 is given , @xmath21 at @xmath22 is determined .",
    "since we focus on the evolution of a massive low - spin seed galaxy , we set these parameters , @xmath4 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , which corresponds to an over - density of @xmath26 for a cdm power spectrum with @xmath27 ( white & frenk 1991 ) . in model 1",
    "we employ @xmath28 .",
    "in model 2 the initial sphere does not have any small - scale density fluctuations , i.e. , the sphere has a completely uniform density .",
    "we assume a flat universe ( @xmath29 ) with a baryon fraction of @xmath30 and a hubble constant of @xmath31 .",
    "we carry out these two simulations using 9171 particles for gas and dark matter respectively .",
    "the masses of individual gas , stellar , and dark matter particles are @xmath32 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 respectively , and softening lengths of gas , stellar , and dark matter particles are @xmath34 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "we simulated the evolution of the two models from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "[ anim1 ] and [ anim2 ] show the evolution of the system in model 1 and model 2 respectively .",
    "these panels show the projection of the particles onto the @xmath38@xmath39 plane , where we take the @xmath39-axis to be the initial rotational axis .",
    "the evolution in model 1 resembles fig .  1 of kawata ( 1999 ) , although he simulated the evolution of a lower mass system ( @xmath40 ) than that of this paper . in fig .  1 the system has already turned around at @xmath41 .",
    "we can observe the sub - clumps caused by initial small - scale density fluctuations . at @xmath42 ,",
    "these clumps merge at the center of the system .",
    "the whole system has collapsed and settled into a spherical system at @xmath43 .",
    "after that , the system evolves little morphologically .",
    "the evolution of model 2 is quite different ( fig .",
    "[ anim2 ] ) .",
    "the gas is accreted to the center very smoothly , which induces star formation .",
    "although the initial angular momentum is very small , a disk - like object is formed by contraction along the initial rotation axis .",
    "model 2 also evolves little morphologically from @xmath43 to @xmath37 .    figs .",
    "[ h1 ] and [ h2 ] show the time variation of the star formation rate , the angular momentum of the baryon component , and the number of the stellar clumps in model 1 and model 2 respectively .",
    "here , a clump means a bound object which is identified by applying to the stellar particles the friend - of - friend ( fof ) algorithm with a linking length of 0.2 times the particle separation required to attain the mean density of the universe at each redshift and with a threshold particle number of 10 .",
    "since model 2 initially has no internal small - scale density fluctuation causing formation of sub - clumps and its subsequent structure is also very smooth ( fig .",
    "[ anim2 ] ) , we do not plot the history of the number of the clumps in fig .",
    "[ h2 ] .    in model 1 star formation begins in the sub - clumps before the whole system collapses .",
    "the major star formation occurs due to the collapse of the whole system and continues for about 1 gyr .",
    "the star formation ceases owing to consumption of the gas .",
    "when the whole system collapses , the number of the clumps decreases suddenly ( see also fig .",
    "[ anim1 ] ) .",
    "this clearly shows that the galaxy is built through the mergers of sub - clumps , i.e. , the hierarchical clustering . at the same time , the angular momentum of the gas component decreases well before the gas is transformed into stars .",
    "this provides an evidence that the mergers of the sub - clumps lead to the angular momentum transfer from the gas component to the dark matter .",
    "we have confirmed that the angular momentum of the dark matter increases , at the expense of the decrease in that of the baryon component , which consists of gas and stars .",
    "we can see that the formation of a spherical system supported by random motions in model 1 is caused by the mergers of the sub - clumps which lead to the angular momentum loss of the baryon component and increase the velocity dispersion .    on the other hand , in model 2 , the angular momentum of the baryon component is almost conserved during the collapse of the system ( fig .  [ h2 ] ) .",
    "the star formation begins just when the system has collapsed and hence the gas density has become high enough . for this reason , the star formation has a very high rate and a short period .",
    "model 2 produces a disk - like object , because the baryon component conserves the angular momentum unlike model 1 .",
    "its collapse along the radial direction is halted at the point where the centrifugal force is balanced by the gravitational force , whereas the system is able to collapse along the initial rotation axis without limit .    in the next section we present the properties of the end - products of the above evolution .",
    "in addition , we quantitatively examine whether each model can reproduce the observed properties of begs .",

    "[ last ] shows final distributions of stellar particles .",
    "these panels show a clear difference between the two configurations .",
    "the end - product of model 1 has a nearly spherical shape , whereas that of model 2 is flat .",
    "these stellar particles contain the information about their age and metallicity owing to the self - consistent calculation of the chemical and dynamical evolution . by means of the population synthesis",
    ", we can derive the photometric properties of the stellar system from this information . here",
    ", the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each stellar particle is assumed to be that of a single stellar population ( ssp ) that means a coeval and chemically homogeneous assembly of stars .",
    "the sed in a projected region , corresponding to one pixel of ccd , is obtained by the summation of the seds of the stellar particles whose projections fall within this region as follows : @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are the mass , age , and metallicity of @xmath50-th stellar particle and @xmath51 is the sed of ssp of 1 @xmath52 with the age , @xmath53 , and the metallicity , @xmath54 .",
    "here we used the data of ssps of kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) . since the observational data with which",
    "our results should be compared provide the luminosity distribution projected to a plane , we first derive the projected distribution of sed from the three dimensional distribution of stellar particles . fig .",

    "a 501 @xmath56 501 pixel mesh is chosen to span the squared region with 50 kpc on a side , and the flux of each stellar particle is smoothed using a gaussian filter with the filter scale , @xmath57 , of 1/4 times the softening length of the stellar particle , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "we discuss the dependence of the results on @xmath57 later .",

    "this corresponds to the de vaucouleurs ( @xmath69 ) law when @xmath70 , whereas the profile with @xmath71 corresponds to the exponential law , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the scale length and @xmath74 is the surface brightness at the center .",

    "the best - fit parameters are shown in the lower left corner in each panel as well as in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the best - fit @xmath76 in model 1 is almost equal to four , and the de vaucouleurs law also provides a good fit .",
    "therefore , model 1 succeeds in reproducing the light profile of begs , which is well fitted by the de vaucouleurs law . on the other hand ,",
    "the best - fit @xmath76 in model 2 is close to one , i.e. , its profile is well described by the exponential law .",
    "this profile resembles the luminosity distribution of a disk galaxy rather than that of begs . however , the central luminosity is too large for disk galaxies ( @xmath77 mag arcsec@xmath78 ) .    to see the robustness of these surface - brightness profiles",
    ", we examined the effects of @xmath57 and the number of particles on these profiles . here",
    "we focus on model 2 , because model 2 provides a more compact system and is likely to be affected by the spatial resolution more severely than model 1 and the robustness of the profiles in model 1 has already been examined in kawata ( 1999 ) .",
    "a large @xmath57 is likely to lead to an artificially spread luminosity distribution and a large half - light radius .",

    "[ last ] and [ sfb ] .",
    "the radial surface - brightness profile obtained with a bin size of @xmath80 are indicated by points .",
    "although the @xmath55 band surface - brightness distribution is not smooth , the best - fitting parameters to the profile agree well with the ones in fig .",
    "this demonstrates clearly that the profile in fig .",
    "[ sfb ] is not artificially spread .",
    "in addition , we carried out the same simulation as model 2 using a smaller number of particles , i.e. , 5575 particles for gas and dark matter respectively .",
    "we call this simulation `` model 2s ''",
    ". the softening lengths of gas , stellar , and dark matter particles are set to @xmath81 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "since model 2s employs a smaller number of particles and smaller softening lengths for gas and stars , this model has a more favorable condition for the artificial two - body scattering than model 2 .",
    "[ ns2dppr ] shows the luminosity distributions in model 2s .",
    "here we use @xmath58 .",
    "the artificial two - body scattering is expected to lead to a more extended surface - brightness profile than that of model 2 . however , there is little difference in the images and the profiles between model 2 and model 2s .",
    "therefore we conclude that the numerical resolution in model 2 is sufficiently fine for the discussion of the luminosity distribution to be meaningful .",
    "it is known that a violent relaxation ( lynden - bell 1967 ) in sufficiently deep central potentials reproduces the de vaucouleurs law ( hjorth & madsen 1991 and references therein ) .",
    "a deep potential causes a strong scattering of tightly bound particles passing near the center , and leads to the outer envelope of the de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "in addition , the clumpiness can strengthen the violent relaxation so that particles are thrown to large radii .",
    "van albada ( 1982 ) showed that a cold collapse with the formation and destruction of substructures is preferred in producing a de vaucouleurs profile in dissipationless collapse .",
    "carlberg , lake , & norman ( 1986 ) found that dissipation , leading to a deep central potential , could help get a good de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "katz & gunn ( 1991 ) and katz ( 1992 ) presented that dissipational hierarchical clustering is suitable for bulge formation .",
    "our results also indicate that a collapse accompanied with the dissipation and the mergers of the sub - clumps is quite appropriate for reproducing the de vaucouleurs profile .",

    "the color gradients are obtained by setting annuli of various radii in the @xmath55 and @xmath87 band images and subtracting the @xmath87 band magnitude from the @xmath55 band magnitude in each annulus .",
    "we made the projected images also for the metallicity , and obtained their radial profile .",

    "the profiles of color and metallicity [ defined as @xmath89 are fitted by linear regression . in fitting , we excluded the data at radii less than the softening length and greater than the radius at which the @xmath55 band surface brightness is @xmath90 ( open symbols in fig.[grad ] ) , because the inner region is affected by the smoothing of gravitational forces whereas the number of particles within an annulus is too small in the outer region .",
    "the best - fit gradients are shown in the lower left corner of each panel in fig .",
    "[ grad ] and table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the data obtained from the simulation results have large errors leading to large errors in the calculated gradients .",
    "however negative gradients are clearly seen in colors and metallicity , i.e. , the color ( metallicity ) at the center is redder ( higher ) than that in the outer region . from the observational studies",

    "1990 ) and @xmath92 ( kobayashi & arimoto 2000 and references therein ) . in model 1",
    "the gradients of both the color and the metallicity are in fairly good agreement with the observed gradients of begs . on the contrary , these gradients are too steep in model 2 .",
    "model 1 is thus favored over model 2 in reproducing the color and metallicity gradients as well as the surface - brightness profiles .",
    "carlberg ( 1984 ) showed that the dissipational collapse of a proto - galaxy with a uniform density leads to a steep metallicity gradient of @xmath93 , using the numerical simulation .",
    "it has already been a serious problem that a metallicity gradient expected in the uniform collapse becomes steeper than the observed one ( e.g. , davies , sadler , & peletier 1993 ; kobayashi & arimoto 2000 ) .",
    "the negative gradients in both the color and the metallicity mean that the star formation persists over longer time in the inner region than in the outer region , due to dissipative infall of gas .",
    "since the residual gas is polluted by the past star formation , metal - rich stars are formed in the central region ( kawata 1999 ) . in model 1 the star formation which occurs in the sub - clumps before the whole system collapses decreases the amounts of the residual gas infalling dissipatively , leading to an appropriate shallower gradients . in addtion",

    "the shallower gradients of model 1 seem to be caused by the combination of these two effects .",
    "the results of our realistic numerical simulations suggest that the formation and clustering of sub - clumps are preferred in producing the observed color and metallicity gradients .    in fig .",

    "there is no difference between model 1 and model 2 in the total magnitudes of the final objects .",

    "owing to the loss of the angular momentum ( fig .",
    "[ h1 ] ) , the end - product in model 1 is a system supported by the random motions and hence rotating slowly .",
    "furthermore , the small - scale initial density fluctuations allow star formation in the sub - clumps before the whole system begins to collapse and the collisionless property of the stellar component prevents the dissipative contraction of the system , leading to an appropriate half - light radius in model 1 . on the other hand , in model 2",
    "the end - product is a nearly rotation - supported system , owing to the angular momentum conservation ( fig .",
    "in addition , the initial - small angular momentum requires a large contraction along the radial direction for producing enough centrifugal force , leading to a small half - light radius .",

    "we showed that the luminosity profile , color and metallicity gradients , half - light radius , and @xmath0 of the end - product formed by clustering of sub - clumps are in very good agreement with those of the observed begs quantitatively . since the cdm cosmology naturally predicts the existence of massive low - spin seed galaxies including small - scale density fluctuations , the cdm scenario is quite suitable for the formation of begs from a massive low - spin seed galaxy , in which the clustering of sub - clumps plays an essential role .    on the other hand , in a massive low - spin seed galaxy including no initial small - scale density fluctuation , the small initial spin leads to a compact disk - like object dominated by the rotation owing to the angular momentum conservation .",

    "<S> we reveal the role of clustering of sub - clumps , which is expected in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe , in forming a bright elliptical galaxy ( beg ) from a low - spin seed galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done by comparing the evolution of a low - spin seed galaxy including small - scale density fluctuations expected in the cdm universe ( model 1 ) with that of a completely uniform one ( model 2 ) , using numerical experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we show that model 2 can not reproduce the properties of begs and forms a disk which is too compact and too bright due to the conservation of the initial - small angular momentum . in model 1 clustering of the sub - clumps caused by initial small - scale density fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> leads to angular momentum transfer from the baryon component to the dark matter and consequently a nearly spherical system supported by random motions is formed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the collisionless property of the stars formed in the sub - clumps prevents the dissipative contraction of the system , leading to a large measured half - light radius . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the end - product is quite well reproduces the observed properties of begs , such as the de vaucouleurs light - profile , typical color and metallicity gradients , the large half - light radius , the small ratio of the rotational velocity to the velocity dispersion ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the clustering of sub - clumps , i.e. , the hierarchical clustering , plays a crucial role in the formation of begs from a low - spin seed galaxy . </S>"
