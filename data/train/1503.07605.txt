    "images from gravitational lensing allow us to understand the detailed mass structure of the intervening galaxy as well as the background source structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , a detection or absence of a central lensed image offers a unique opportunity to map the innermost mass distribution of the lensing galaxy and to directly measure the mass of the central supermassive black hole ( smbh , @xcite ) .",
    "precise mass modeling requires sensitive , extinction - free , and extremely high resolution imaging toward the very center of a lensing galaxy @xcite .",
    "this is now possible with long baseline capabilities offered by the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) . here",
    "we present a detailed modeling of a mass profile of the @xmath0 elliptical galaxy , which is the foreground galaxy in the galaxy  galaxy lensing system h - atlas j090311.6 + 003906 ( sdp.81 ) , using 30 milli - arcsec ( mas ) resolution 1-mm images obtained at alma .",
    "sdp.81 is a gravitationally lensed @xmath7 galaxy discovered in the _ herschel _ astrophysical terahertz large area survey ( h - atlas , @xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic features ( `` einstein ring '' ) are evident in the @xmath8 resolution interferometric maps @xcite and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) image @xcite , indicating strong magnification .",
    "carbon monoxide ( co ) and water ( h@xmath9o ) emission were successfully detected from the background galaxy @xcite .",
    "the foreground elliptical galaxy is identified in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) as sdss  j090311.57 + 003906.5 ( hereafter sdss",
    "j0903 ) with a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we hereafter refer to the foreground and background galaxies as sdss  j0903 and sdp.81 , respectively .",

    "the alma data at wavelengths of 1.0 , 1.3 and 2.0  mm were obtained during the long baseline campaign of science verification @xcite . the resulting spatial resolution achieved at 1.0 , 1.3 and 2.0  mm are @xmath19 mas ( pa = 15@xmath20 ) , @xmath21 mas ( pa = 20@xmath20 ) and @xmath22 mas ( pa = 18@xmath20 ) , with r.m.s .  noise level of 10 , 10 , and 9  @xmath23jy beam@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the co ( 54 ) , ( 87 ) and ( 109 ) images were also taken simultaneously in the 2.0 , 1.3 and 1.0  mm bands , respectively .",
    "the co images are @xmath24-tapered to @xmath25  mas in order to increase the sensitivity to extended structure .",
    "details of the observations are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a three - color image composed from the 1.0 and 1.3  mm data are shown in figure  [ fig : fig1]a . the quadruple images of sdp.81 are clearly resolved , three of which are bridged by a @xmath26-long arc .",
    "the arcs consist of four bright knots connected by thin smooth filaments .",
    "the grainy clumps seen around the arcs are not coherent among the different frequency bands ( figure  [ fig : fig1]a ) , and thus they are likely to be artifacts due to phase calibration residuals . on the other hand , we find fainter , but significant knots embedded in the arcs that are consistent in all different waveband images . these are real features that are likely tracing the internal substructures of sdp.81 . a central point source bracketed by the long and short arcs",
    "is not resolved with the band 7 beam and has a 1.02.0  mm power - law spectral index of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the extrapolated flux at 20  cm is consistent with that of the cataloged radio source first  j090311.5 + 003906 ( @xmath28  mjy  beam@xmath14 , @xcite ) . the power - law spectral index from 1.0  mm to 20",
    "cm is @xmath29 ( see inset of figure  [ fig : fig1]b ) , which is consistent with the spectral index measured for 1.02.0 mm . if the non - thermal emission arises from sdp.81 , it should also dominate the emission from the arcs . however , the observed spectral index of the arc is positive ( typically @xmath30 ) , meaning that dust emission is the better model to explain the emission characteristics of the arc @xcite .",
    "furthermore , no molecular lines of co and h@xmath9o at @xmath7 are found at the position .",
    "it is therefore likely that the non - thermal emission arises from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) of sdss  j0903 .",
    "we retrieve the archival hst image ( proposal i d : 12194 , @xcite ) taken with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) at 1.6  @xmath31 ( f160w , _ h _ band ) .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) is 151  mas in fwhm .",
    "we calibrate the coordinates of the wfc3 image using the catalog data from the sdss data release 12 .",
    "we use 46 sdss objects located in the wfc3 image to derive the astrometric fit using iraf . the r.m.s .",
    "errors of the fit are 85  mas in right ascension and 100  mas in declination . the nominal center of sdss  j0903 matches the position of the central non - thermal source in the alma images within 15  mas .",
    "we use the galfit software ( version 3.0.5 , @xcite ) to deblend the stellar light in sdp.81 from sdss  j0903 . following the procedure adopted by @xcite",
    ", two srsic profiles are simultaneously fitted to the hst image . as a result ,",
    "the radial profile of sdss  j0903 is decomposed into a brighter ( _ h_-band absolute ab magnitude of @xmath32 ) elliptical with a srsic index of @xmath33 and a fainter ( @xmath34 ) exponential disk with @xmath35 .",
    "although our total flux is @xmath36 higher , this is consistent with the model presented by @xcite .",
    "the residual image shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] clearly exhibits the stellar arcs which are significantly ( @xmath37  mas ) offset from the 1-mm alma arcs ( see paper ii for the interpretation ) .",
    "we use the glafic software @xcite to reproduce the lensed image using an isothermal ellipsoid with a flat core .",
    "the choice of an isothermal ellipsoid is supported by the fact that the radial density profile of sdss  j0903 is consistent with @xmath38 @xcite , which is the profile expected for an isothermal ellipsoid .",
    "the structure of sdp.81 is , however , too complex to be accounted for by a single isothermal ellipsoid alone .",
    "we examine the sdss cluster catalog of @xcite and find a cluster of galaxies at @xmath39 with the richness of @xmath40 and located @xmath41 away from sdss  j0903 .",
    "therefore we include the third - order and quadrupole perturbations of mass for the quadrupole perturbation ( equation  13 of @xcite ) .",
    "the central positions of the perturbation components are fixed to that of the isothermal ellipsoid .",
    "] , in addition to the standard external shear , to take into account the gravitational influence of the cluster and large - scale structure .",
    "we identify compact knots in the arcs that are common in the 1.0 , 1.3 , and 2.0  mm images and then identify two sets of counter - images of the knots in sdp.81 .",
    "these are shown as open squares in figure  [ fig : fig1]b ( a and e ) .",
    "the counter - images of each set are extracted by visually identifying continuum intensity peaks which share the same / similar co ( 54 ) and ( 87 ) spectral profiles at each of the peaks .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1]b shows how the counter - images are identified ; all of the co ( 54 ) spectra at the positions of a have a peak at @xmath42 km  s@xmath14 while the peaks at e appear near @xmath43 km  s@xmath14 and have broader line profiles than a , which likely correspond to the red and blue components reported by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "this method allows us to predict that the knots a are quadruple lensed images of a single source , whereas the knots e are double images and thus the ( tangential ) caustics should lie between a and e on the source plane .",
    "first , we obtain an initial mass model only with the isothermal ellipsoid and external shear using the positions of a and e. then we use the initial mass model to identify groups of counter - images of knots found in the 1.0-mm continuum image .",
    "the knots within @xmath44 mas from the predicted positions are identified as the counter - images , resulting in identifications of 46 images .",
    "we then refine the mass model by adding the higher - order perturbations ( the number of independent parameters is 12 ) and fitting all of the identified multiple images . in the model calculation",
    ", we also consider two sets of double images identified with the 1.6-@xmath31 hst image , which is indicated by star symbols in figure  [ fig : fig1]a .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) is thus @xmath45 .",
    "the positional uncertainty of the knots used for optimization is set to 20  mas , while the uncertainties of the 10 knots which are close to the critical curve and/or possibly suffering from blending are set to 100200  mas .",
    "the uncertainties of the four hst images are set to 130200  mas .",
    "the best - fit parameters of the mass model are listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] , where the @xmath46 confidence intervals are computed by marcov - chain monte carlo simulations as shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "note that the core radius ( @xmath47 ) and velocity dispersion ( @xmath48 ) of the isothermal ellipsoid are highly degenerate .",
    "the central position of the isothermal ellipsoid is not only consistent with the brightness peak of the stellar distribution within the @xmath46 astrometric uncertainty of hst ( @xmath49  mas ) , but also with the location of the candidate agn , i.e. , @xmath50 , to within @xmath5  mas ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this suggests that the agn is indeed located at the bottom ( innermost @xmath51-pc ) of the potential well of sdss  j0903 .",
    "the best - fit parameters of the isothermal ellipsoid and external shear are in good agreement with those independently obtained using the same alma images @xcite used in @xcite is related by @xmath52 . ] and the hst images @xcite at @xmath46 level .    the crosses in figure  [ fig : fig1]b mark the positions of the counter - images predicted by this model , and we find that the model is qualitatively consistent with the peak positions of the 1.0-mm brightness distribution ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : fig1]c and [ fig : fig1]d show the predicted brightness distributions on the image and source planes , respectively .",
    "the observed images are reproduced by 35 @xmath2-pc - sized knots embedded in an extended ( @xmath54  kpc ) disk .",
    "while the uncertainty is relatively large , the total magnification factor is expected to be @xmath55 .",
    "this is consistent with the value obtained by @xcite ( @xmath56 for total , @xmath57 for a central star - forming disk ) , while it is @xmath58 higher than the value previously obtained with the sma ( @xmath59 , @xcite ) .",
    "this is likely because , as suggested by @xcite , the alma image allows us to identify more compact structures close to the caustics , resulting in higher magnifications than those obtained previously .      in figure",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we show the surface mass profile of the gravitational lens model normalized by a cosmological critical density for a source redshift @xmath17 ( i.e. , convergence @xmath60 ) and a radial profile of the 1.6-@xmath31 stellar light obtained by the hst / wfc3 f160w imaging observations .",
    "the critical density is @xmath61 @xmath62 kpc@xmath63 , and the stellar surface mass is scaled using a fiducial mass - to - light ratio of @xmath64 at @xmath65 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is a typical value for local massive ellipticals . because the stellar profile is lowpass - filtered by the psf of hst ( 151  mas , see the dotted curve ) , the profile is only reliable at @xmath66 .",
    "it is evident that there is a knee in the stellar profile at a characteristic radius of @xmath67 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we also show the lensing mass profile smoothed by the hst psf .",
    "the knee position and the amplitude of the profile are in agreement with the lens model .",
    "although the derived core ( @xmath68  mas , which corresponds to a core diameter of @xmath69400  pc ) is slightly smaller than the stellar core ( @xmath70  mas ) , the two core radii are consistent to within the @xmath46 uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , the position angle of the isothermal ellipsoid ( @xmath71 ) is consistent with that of the stellar profile ( @xmath72 , @xcite ) , suggesting that the baryonic matter , traced by the stellar light , dominates the mass in the inner 1-kpc region of the galaxy . at larger radii ( @xmath73  kpc ) , however , the stellar light falls below the model surface density ( @xmath74 ) , which can be interpreted as the presence of dark matter in the outer parts of sdss  j0903 .",
    "the non - detection of the central ` odd ' image of sdp.81 in the deep alma images rules out a top - flat plateau in the gravitational potential , but instead requires the presence of a steep ( or cuspy ) radial profile in the innermost potential distribution .",
    "a smbh can make the central potential more cuspy even if the stellar mass distribution is top - flat as suggested from the wfc3 radial profile . as a consequence",
    ", this can erase the central image if the black hole is massive enough to fully perturb the core potential . since there is a clear sign of the presence of an agn at the center of sdss  j0903",
    ", we add a point source mimicking the smbh to the lens model in order to investigate how the smbh affects the flux of the central image .",
    "a point mass with @xmath75 to @xmath76 is placed at the position of the agn and @xmath47 is fixed to the stellar core radius of @xmath77  mas , while the rest are treated as free parameters ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4 ] shows s@xmath79/s@xmath80 ( i.e. the ratio between the flux from the central image to all of the counter - images ) as a function of @xmath81 .",
    "the fit to the model is generally good ( @xmath82 ) in the range of @xmath83 .",
    "the ratio is insensitive to the black hole mass if it is less than @xmath84 @xmath85 , but the central image rapidly dims as the black hole mass is higher than @xmath86 .",
    "the horizontal dotted line shows the @xmath87 upper limit of the 1.0-mm image ( 30  @xmath23jy ) divided by the total flux ( @xmath88 mjy , @xcite ) , suggesting that the alma non - detection places a constraint to the black hole mass of @xmath89 .",
    "note that if we adopt @xmath90  mas , the limit is slightly relaxed to @xmath91 .",
    "a black hole mass can independently be estimated from the well - known correlation between black hole mass and the velocity dispersion of the bulge ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the black hole estimated from the velocity dispersion of the lens ( @xmath92  km  s@xmath14 , table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) and using the local correlation @xcite is @xmath93 @xmath85 , which is consistent with the lower limit derived above .",
    "it will difficult to detect the central image of sdp.81 even in future alma observations if @xmath94 .",
    "we demonstrate in this work that the detailed gravitational lens modeling using sensitive , high - resolution imaging with alma is capable of constraining the central @xmath95  kpc mass profile and the black hole mass , which will help us understand the co - evolution of the smbhs and the host galaxies through , for example , smbh scouring @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that a similar conclusion on the mass of the smbh ( @xmath96 ) was made by a recent analysis by @xcite , where they used an independent code glee @xcite and different sets of multiple images from the alma images tapered to @xmath97 mas to construct a lens model .",
    "nevertheless , we prefer to use the full resolution alma images ( up to 23 mas ) , which allows us to ( 1 ) accurately model higher - order perturbations , and to ( 2 ) robustly identify multiple features in the images and construct a reliable lens model .",
