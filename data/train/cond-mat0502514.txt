    "the composite fermion approach@xcite has had a great number of extremely impressive successes in describing the physics of electrons in high magnetic fields . in this picture ,",
    "fractional quantum hall systems in total magnetic field @xmath8 are described in terms of noninteracting  composite fermions \" in an effective magnetic field @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the flux quantum , @xmath11 is the electron density , and @xmath1 is a positive integer .",
    "this maps , for example , fractional quantum hall states at filling fractions of the form @xmath12 to integer quantum hall states for the composite fermions at filling fraction @xmath13",
    ". we will denote such composite fermions with @xmath14 flux quanta attached to them as @xmath15cf .",
    "jain s original approach to composite fermions@xcite constructed highly accurate trial wavefunctions by taking simple wavefunctions for the noninteracting ( composite ) fermions in the effective magnetic field , multiplying by jastrow factors , and then projecting the result into the lowest landau level",
    ". the early successes of this method were impressive@xcite , despite the fact that the method was limited by the extreme numerical difficulty of performing projections for systems with more than roughly 10 electrons .",
    "a major theoretical breakthrough came when jain and kamilla@xcite discovered a new way of writing composite fermion trial wavefunctions ( described below ) , which involves a very minor modification of the projection .",
    "these new trial states seemed to be just as good as the originally proposed wavefunctions and could be numerically generated even for systems with many electrons ( 40 electrons or more ) . since that time , many important studies have been achieved using this method@xcite .",
    "however , so far this method has been restricted to cases where the effective magnetic field has the same sign as the external magnetic field .",
    "results using this method have been published for filling fractions of the form @xmath0 with @xmath16 but not for @xmath5 . in the current paper",
    ", we extend the work of jain and kamilla@xcite so that we are able to handle states with @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 states take more computational resources than the case of @xmath4 , and the difference in the computational resources between the two cases increases with the absolute value of the effective flux .",
    "however , the computational problems turn out to be more severe for the smallest @xmath19 , where the number of particles in the system increases most slowly with each flux added .",
    "fortunately , we probably need not go to particularly large systems to understand the physics of small @xmath19 . for large @xmath19 , describing the approach to the fermi liquid - like composite fermion state , the system size is already large for relatively small effective flux , i.e. the differences of the computational requirements in the case of @xmath4 and @xmath17 become relatively less important .",
    "although the case of negative @xmath2 has not previously been studied for large systems , we point out that for @xmath3 the series of states with negative @xmath2 and the series of states with positive @xmath2 are essentially equivalent due to an exact particle - hole symmetry in the lowest landau level .",
    "in fact , below , we exploit this symmetry to check the validity of our method .",
    "once we have verified the method , we can study the properties of the @xmath6 series for negative @xmath2 and compare the results to those of the positive @xmath2 members of this same series as well as to those of the @xmath3 series .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : jk ]",
    "we briefly review the jain - kamilla method .",
    "as mentioned above , the method has only been used previously for the case of positive @xmath2 . in appendix",
    "[ app : jk ] we show in detail how the crucial projection scheme of jain - kamilla can easily be generalized to handle negative @xmath2 also .",

    "[ sec : phsym ] we test our approach by examining the @xmath20cf series @xmath21 . in particular , we examine ground state energies , excitation spectra , and energy gaps .",

    "we also do not see signs of the experimentally observed diverging effective mass as @xmath102 is approached .",
    "our values of the effective mass are somewhat less than that obseved experimentally in general .",
    "however , it is known that finite well width corrections tend to increase the effective masses@xcite .",
    "two additional data points are shown in this figure ( not mentioned in the legend ) which give results obtained by treating @xmath79 as a @xmath20cf state . ]",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath109 similarity in spectra found here differs from the particle - hole symmetry correspondence of @xmath2 with the @xmath110 states in the @xmath21 series shown above in section [ sec : phsym ] .",
    "one might naively expect that the particle - hole symmetry @xmath111 for states in the @xmath20cf series @xmath21 above survives the composite fermionization attachment of two more jastrow factors and results in an approximate symmetry for @xmath97 states .",
    "for example , we could take the symmetry related @xmath3 pair ( @xmath112 ) and ( @xmath113 ) at @xmath114 on table [ tab : results_m1 ] and add two jastrow factors so @xmath115 resulting in an approximate symmetry relating ( @xmath116 ) to ( @xmath117 ) in table [ tab : table_m2 ] .",
    "however , when we examine the overall shape of the resulting excitation spectra , we find very little relation between the two spectra related by @xmath118 for @xmath22cfs .",
    "in contrast we see in figure [ fig : spectra_m2 ] that the @xmath109 related states have quite similar dispersions , and the similarity appears to increase with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "we comment that another interesting test of our approach can be obtained by constructing a trial wavefunction for @xmath79 as the @xmath119 member of the @xmath97 series .",
    "we find that the ground state energy of this wavefunction is , within numerical precision , precisely the same as that of the laughlin @xmath79 trial wavefunction , which leads us to believe that we have precisely constructed that state .",
    "similarly , we can examine the excitation spectrum of @xmath79 by using a @xmath20cf wavefunction of the series @xmath120 with @xmath80 or by using a @xmath22cf wavefunction of the series @xmath106 with @xmath119 .",
    "we find that the spectra obtained in these two approaches are quite similar to each other ( albeit not quite identical ) , which gives us still further confidence in our approach .",
    "the values of the magneto - roton gap appear to be almost exactly the same in both cases . yet , examining the large @xmath96 gap , the @xmath22cf trial wavefunction using negative flux ( @xmath119 ) yields a slightly larger value , which decreases slightly more rapidly with the system size though , and seems to extrapolate to almost the same value at infinite @xmath70 ( see figure [ fig : gap_thermo ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : gap_thermo ] shows the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit of the data given in table [ tab : table_m2 ] , comparing gaps at @xmath2 with those of states at @xmath105 .",
    "a comparison of the excitations at @xmath79 considered in the two different manners discussed above is also displayed there .",
    "further , this figure gives us an idea of the quality of our extrapolation .",
    "where the extrapolation is not particularly smooth , we can not claim to deliver more than a rough result .",
    "the extrapolation of @xmath107 appears to be the most difficult , since it is not easy to distinguish a clear linear dependence of the large @xmath96 gap as a function of @xmath121 for the initial data set .",
    "the reason for this problem appears to be that the magnetoroton gap is located at a large value of @xmath60 , so that in the smaller systems , the magnetoroton gap is located very close to the largest @xmath96 available , or even coincides with this point . for the @xmath122 case",
    ", we can see the error in this extrapolation clearly by comparing our extrapolated result to a result of a similar calculation using larger system sizes from ref . .",
    "this comparison is show in figure [ fig:4cfmasses ] ( see below ) .",
    "we might guess that the error in extrapolation for @xmath82 is of similar magnitude .    in order to obtain the composite fermion effective mass",
    ", we equate the activation gap @xmath123 ( determined from the excitation energy at the maximum angular momentum , i.e. biggest particle - hole separation ) to the cyclotron energy of cfs in their effective magnetic field : @xmath124 since the gap is measured in units of the coulomb interaction , we write @xmath125 .",
    "further taking into account @xmath126 for gaas and the free electron mass as our point of reference , we find the dimensionless normalized effective mass @xmath127})$ ] to be given by @xmath128 .",
    "the @xmath22cf - masses we obtain are displayed in figure [ fig:4cfmasses ] together with the large @xmath96 gaps from which they are deduced .",
    "in addition , for @xmath129 ( positive @xmath2 ) we have shown data from ref .",
    "where larger systems were used than we have used here ( when we also use larger system sizes , our results agree very will with those of ref . ) . for @xmath79 , as discussed above , we have shown results that treat this either as a @xmath119 point of the @xmath106 series or a @xmath80 point of the @xmath120 series . for the latter case , we have likewise included the result from the above mentioned larger system calculation .    in figure [ fig:4cfmasses ]",
    ", we have intentionally displayed data extrapolated from a restricted set of small systems sizes with positive @xmath2 so as to match the same set of system sizes that we study for negative @xmath2 where we can not go to very large systems .",
    "one can estimate the finite size error for our negative @xmath2 calculations by examining the deviations between these restricted extrapolations at positive @xmath2 compared to the larger system calculations of ref .",
    "( also displayed in our figure ) .",
    "the behavior of the negative @xmath2 fractions seems to roughly mirror the behavior of the positive @xmath2 fractions . as was seen previously in ref .",
    "for @xmath4 it is seen that the effective mass increases with @xmath130 .",
    "as @xmath102 is approached from either side , it is not clear if the effective mass will converge to a constant as would be predicted by theory ( up to logarithmic corrections@xcite ) . in the experiments of ref . , a striking asymmetry of the effective mass beween the high field and low field sides of @xmath102 has been observed .",
    "while we can not rule out some asymmetry from our data , we certainly can not claim to see the extremely strong differences that are observed experimentally .",
    "this , however , is not surprising .",
    "experimentally , the asymmetry is attributed to the proximity of a wigner crystal state@xcite .",
    "since we are using a trial wavefunction approach , we should not see the effects of any imminent phase transition .",
    "perhaps the most interesting data point in figure [ fig:4cfmasses ] is the one at @xmath79 . whether we treat this point as the @xmath119 member of the series @xmath106 or the @xmath80 member of the series @xmath120 , we find almost identical results of a very large gap , which establishes a continuity between the cf masses around @xmath93 and @xmath102 .",
    "furthermore , we note that this point is quite asymmetric with its reflection at @xmath108 .",
    "certainly the hypothesis of constant effective composite fermion mass does not extend all the way from @xmath102 out to both @xmath108 and @xmath79 .",
    "below quarter filling , one observes a continuous increase of this mass .",
    "a similar trend appears at small values of the effective magnetic field above this point , but then the mass drops down again at @xmath79 , the final point of this series .    generally , our values for the effective mass seem to be lower than those measured in the experiments of ref . by a factor of roughly @xmath131 .",
    "this error is rather expected , since similar discrepancies have been observed in previous studies based on the composite fermion picture@xcite .",
    "it is known , however , that taking into account the finite width of the 2d electron gas changes the interaction so as to increase the effective mass@xcite .",
    "we note that we are not able to find any evidence of the divergence of @xmath132 as we approach @xmath102 from either side , which is observed experimentally in ref . .",
    "this is not surprising for several reasons .",
    "first of all , the experiment only sees strong divergences extremely close to @xmath102  which we can not access numerically .",
    "furthermore , one might suspect that the disorder might be the source of the divergences in the measurements used by pan .",
    "more importantly , however , even if there were genuine infra - red divergences@xcite of the effective mass as @xmath102 is approached , one would not necessarily expect such divergences to be properly represented in a trial wavefunction approach .",
    "we emphasize that the most important achievement of this paper is not any particular numerical result .",
    "if genuine numbers were desired for comparison to experiment , we would want to use a more realistic interaction , accounting for finite well width@xcite , as well as perhaps landau - level mixing , and we would want to use a more powerful computer to analyze ever larger systems . instead we would like to emphasize in this paper that we have clearly demonstrated that we can extend the approach of jain and kamilla@xcite to treat negative effective magnetic field , and we can study these negative @xmath2 composite fermion wavefunctions for reasonably large systems , which has not been done before . in this paper",
    "we have tested this method by using particle - hole symmetry for the @xmath20cf series and we have found our method to be quite accurate . we have then applied this method to @xmath22cfs to study , for the first time , large systems for filling fractions @xmath106 with negative @xmath2 .",
    "our main physical result is that the effective mass appears to be roughly symmetric around and close to @xmath102 although larger system calculations would be desirable .",

    ", we focus on the case where @xmath149 , since the @xmath150 case has already been discussed in detail in ref . .",
    "for the rest of this paragraph , we thus assume @xmath149 .",
    "expanding the jacobi polynomials in terms of the spinor coordinates @xmath151 and @xmath152 , one obtains @xmath153 this expression can equally well be obtained from the relation for complex conjugation of the monopole harmonics@xcite , if one corrects kamilla s formula by replacing @xmath104 by @xmath154 in the appropriate places .",
    "we now use the @xmath155 as single particle wavefunctions ( written as @xmath26 in the main text ) and composite fermionize by attaching jastrow factors . as discussed in the main text",
    ", we can construct the many particle composite fermion trial wavefunctions by bringing the jastrow factors inside the slater determinant of single particle states , which may then be projected individually .",
    "note , that in the spherical geometry , the jastrow factor becomes @xmath156 the details of the required projection @xmath157 are discussed next .",
    "first , we remark that the jastrow factor , according to kamilla s notation , whereas @xmath1 , that had been used for this purpose in section [ sec : jk ] to comply with the common notation for the filling fractions of jain s series , is already used for the eigenvalue of @xmath158 here . ]",
    "@xmath159 is a lll function , with @xmath160 zeros in @xmath161 , i.e. it is a lll wavefunction for flux @xmath162 .",
    "since @xmath70 is in general a big number , we have @xmath163 .",
    "the resulting wavefunction , in turn , has to be a valid wavefunction for a total number of flux @xmath164 . secondly ,",
    "since projection is a linear operation , we may consider the action of projection on each of the basis states @xmath165 separately , by expanding @xmath159 in this basis .",
    "in general multiplication by a basis state @xmath166 followed by projection can be described as a linear operator called hereafter @xmath167 .",
    "@xmath168 since we know the entire basis of the subspace that we project upon , namely the lll for flux @xmath169 with states @xmath170 , and @xmath171 , the projection operator is @xmath172 .",
    "we now show , how this leads to an expression for @xmath167 as a differential operator in the coordinate representation , in which ( [ projection_of_basis_states ] ) becomes @xmath173 integration over the longitudinal angle @xmath136 singles out one nonzero scalar product for @xmath174 , and the one remaining integral over the azimuthal angle @xmath133 yields a well known binomial coefficient . simplifying the normalization factors of @xmath165 on both sides , we have : @xmath175 using the explicit form of the normalization @xmath176 and remarking that the fractions of factorials that are left in this expression equal those that appear by the multiple derivation of a monomial @xmath177 @xmath178 we may deduce @xmath167 by comparison of both sides : @xmath179 let us remark that this result reproduces the known result , that the projection on the lll is achieved by performing the habitual procedure of moving all @xmath180 s and @xmath181 s to the far left , and replacing them with derivatives according to @xmath182 nevertheless , performing this explicit projection gives us a supplementary information in the form of a weight factor @xmath183 for the different landau levels before projection , which of course does not matter for the problems discussed here , but may play a role in other cases@xcite .    practically , we would like to obtain a form of ( [ eq : projop ] ) with the derivatives moved to the extreme right , which may be calculated using a straightforward application of the leibniz rule for multiple derivatives in both @xmath184 and @xmath185 : @xmath186 this yields a triple sum with the inner summation ranges being dependant on the outer summation index @xmath187 .",
    "one finds that the summation ranges can be made independent of @xmath187 since the summand becomes zero outside of the given intervals .",
    "as such the sum over @xmath187 may be evaluated using @xmath188 since the result yields a kronecker delta , one of the remaining sums becomes trivial , and after shifting the remaining summation index , the final result is revealed to be exactly like ( [ eq : projop ] ) , but with all derivatives placed at the very right .    the projected composite fermion wavefunction is nothing but this operator applied to the single particle jastrow factor : @xmath189    in order to perform numerical calculations with this wavefunction , we need to evaluate the derivatives explicitly .",
    "one may use jain and kamilla s approach@xcite , to commute the derivatives through the jastrow factors as @xmath190 \\intertext{with } & \\hat u_i = j_i^{-p } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i}j_i^p,\\text { and } \\,\\hat v_i = j_i^{-p } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_i}j_i^p\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] constructing a many - particle wavefunction out of these projected cf wavefunctions in the form of a slater determinant , one may factor out the jastrow factors again , and thus obtains a form which resembles single particle wavefunctions , on a basis of projected states @xmath191 with : @xmath192\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of course , this only appears to be a one particle wavefunction , since there is an implicit dependence of the positions of all other electrons in the system hidden in the operators @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the complexity of this expression increases with the total number of derivatives per term , given by @xmath195 for negative @xmath104 compared to @xmath196 for positive effective flux .",
    "in the lowest landau level , on the sphere , there are @xmath197 single particle eigenstates where @xmath100 is the flux through the sphere .",
    "we label these eigenstates by the @xmath54-component of their angular momentum @xmath1 .",
    "for a two - body interaction we can write the hamiltonian as @xmath198 as usual , the normal ordering of the operators accounts for the uniform positive background . as usual , the fermion operators have anticommutation relations @xmath199",
    ". the interaction matrix @xmath200 must have the following symmetries @xmath201 furthermore , for any rotationally ( translationally ) invariant interaction , we must have angular momentum conservation , which implies that the matrix element is zero unless @xmath202    we define the vacuum state @xmath203 , to be the state which contains no electrons at all . the filled landau level , which we can also think of as the vacuum for holes is written as @xmath204 for holes , given by @xmath205 which also obey the usual anticommutations @xmath206 .",
    "we now rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of these hole operators . using the commutation relations as well as above",
    "described symmetries of @xmath200 we obtain @xmath207 where @xmath208 and @xmath209    we show below that for any rotationally invariant interaction , @xmath210 is actually independent of @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , it is very easy to show that the energy of the entirely filled landau level is given by @xmath211 thus we have @xmath212 and @xmath213 is the number of holes ( i.e. , the eigenvalue of @xmath214 ) .    a general state containing @xmath70 electrons in the lll can be written as : @xmath215 electrons .",
    "note that both of these states  live \" in the same lowest landau level which has @xmath216 single particle eigenstates ( indexed by @xmath1 ) .",
