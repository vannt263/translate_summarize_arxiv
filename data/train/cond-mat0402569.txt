    "the intra - chain excitations of a conjugated polymer in the solid state are often strongly screened by the environment of the other polymers .",
    "this screening causes significant reductions of the ionic single - chain excitation energies and charge gaps , and thus single - chain calculations are expected to considerably over - estimate the actual excitation energies of polymers in the solid state . in particular ,",
    "the energy of a point charge is typically reduced by approximately @xmath1 ev , while the excitation energy of the lowest dipole allowed exciton is reduced by approximately @xmath2 ev , implying a deviation of approximately @xmath3 ev in the single - chain calculated exciton binding energy in comparison to the solid state measurements.@xcite    it is useful to consider two limiting cases for the interaction between the electron - hole pair and the polarization of the dielectric medium , namely solvation - like versus dispersion - like interactions . by solvation ,",
    "we mean a polarization that develops around the electron and hole and follows the motion of these charged species ( that is , the dielectric is fast compared to the electron - hole motion ) . in this case , the effects of the polarization can be absorbed into a static screened electron - hole coulomb interaction . by dispersion ,",
    "we mean the interaction between fluctuating dipoles , such as may arise between the fluctuating dipole of the bound electron - hole pair in an exciton and the dipoles of the dielectric medium .",
    "the interactions become dispersion - like when the time scale of the electron - hole motion is comparable to or less than the time scale of the dielectric response ( that is , the electron - hole motion is fast compared to the dielectric ) . in this case",
    ", the dielectric polarization does not identically follow the electron - hole motion , but rather fluctuates in a manner that is correlated with the motion of the electron - hole pair .",
    "now , the effects of the polarization may be modelled by a dynamically screened electron - hole coulomb interaction .",
    "the nature of the screening thus depends on the relative time scale of the electron - hole motion , which is approximately inversely proportional to the exciton binding energy@xcite , versus the time scale of the dielectric polarization , which is inversely proportional to the optical gap of the dielectric medium . in inorganic semiconductors ,",
    "the exciton binding energy is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the optical gap .",
    "the polarization is then much faster than the electron - hole motion , such that it can follow the electron - hole motion and effectively screen the coulomb interaction.@xcite in organic semiconductors , the exciton binding energy is comparable to the optical gap and we expect the interaction between the exciton and the dielectric polarization to have a dispersion - like character . in this regime",
    ", there is no _ a priori _ reason to suppose that a static dielectric response function will correctly describe the relevant physics@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a dynamic model of the dielectric - making no assumptions about time scales - with which we attempt to understand the screening of the key excited states of conjugated polymers .",
    "we consider the rle of lengths scales ( namely , the electron - hole separation versus the length scales in the monopole - dipole interaction ) , time scales ( namely , exciton excitation energy versus binding energy ) , and ionicity versus covalency in the excited states .",
    "the correlated electron dynamics within a single chain are modelled by the pariser - parr - pople ( p - p - p ) model , while the dielectric is treated as a linear chain of quantized dipoles .",
    "this model is solved essentially exactly via the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method.@xcite    the plan of this paper is as follows : in the next section the model is introduced and parameterized . in the following section we discuss our results , and finally conclude .",
    "the model is designed to represent the dielectric response of an array of conjugated polymers parallel to the solute ( or test ) chain . the dielectric function , @xmath4 , of an assembly of polymers is@xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the frequency and oscillator strength for the @xmath8th transition , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the electronic charge and mass , @xmath11 is the dielectric constant of free - space , and @xmath12 is the number of polymers per unit volume . in this paper",
    "we consider a ` two - state ' model , namely we only consider excitations of the dielectric from the ground state to the first dipole - allowed state ( e.g. the @xmath13 state in centro - symmetric polymers ) .",
    "then , using the oscillator sum rule , @xmath14 where , @xmath15 we have @xmath16 in this expression , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the transition dipole moment and frequency of the excited state .",
    "@xmath19 corresponds to the optical gap of the polymers .",
    "we note that for @xmath20 eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) becomes , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the plasma frequency .",
    "this frequency is typically @xmath23 evs - much larger than the optical gap or the energy scale of the electron - hole motion - so this limit need not concern us here .",
    "since the dipole moment of the chain is parallel to the chain axis , we consider a line of longitudinal dipoles , each oscillating with a characteristic frequency , @xmath18.@xcite the dipole at @xmath24 interacts with a point - charge on the solute chain at @xmath25 via the monopole - dipole interaction , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the dipole moment , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the normal distance of the line of dipoles from the chain , as illustrated in fig .  1 .    [ fig1 ]    a realistic model of the dielectric would consist of a three - dimensional array of lines of dipoles surrounding the solute chain",
    ". however , such a model would not be easily soluble by the dmrg method .",
    "instead , we consider a one - dimensional model and derive an effective interaction between the monopoles and the three - dimensional array of dipoles by integrating over a cylinder with inner and outer radii of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively : @xmath32.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath33 is the number density of dipoles and @xmath34 is the linear separation ( for convenience taken to be the separation between the sites on the chain ) .",
    "the purpose of this integration procedure is that it performs a type of average over the distances between the line dipoles and the solute chain .",
    "however , @xmath30 is still the effective length scale in the interaction , as shown in  fig .  2 , which shows @xmath35 for different @xmath31 for fixed @xmath30 .",
    "for both @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath37 @xmath35 is strongly peaked at approximately the value of @xmath30 .",
    "thus , using a single line dipole a distance @xmath30 away would give very similar results to the cylinder of inner radius @xmath30 .",
    "[ fig2 ]    the hamiltonian is thus , @xmath39 where , @xmath40 is the p - p - p model , describing the interacting electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "@xmath41 creates an electron with spin @xmath42 in the @xmath43-orbital on site @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 is the ohno - coulomb repulsion , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the dielectric constant ( generally taken to be @xmath1 ) , the bond lengths are in @xmath37 and @xmath49 .",
    "the bond lengths , @xmath34 , used in the evaluation of @xmath46 are @xmath50 @xmath37 , and the bond angle is @xmath51 .",
    "the transfer integral is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the bond dimerization parameter .",
    "the hamiltonian , @xmath54 describes the oscillating dipoles .",
    "@xmath55 is a boson operator creating a quantum of energy @xmath56 in a linear harmonic oscillator located at @xmath24 .",
    "this term describes the non - interacting self - energy of the oscillating dipoles .",
    "however , in this model we neglect the dipole - dipole interactions , as in one dimension this induces an unphysical spontaneous dipole moment .",
    "thus , the classical limit ( defined as @xmath57 ) is not completely described by this model .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) , the monopole - dipole hamiltonian is , @xmath58 ( \\hat{n}_i-1 ) \\lambda \\frac{(b^{\\dagger}_j + b_j)}{2},\\ ] ] where we define the dimensionless monopole - dipole coupling constant , @xmath59 , as , @xmath60 and we have used @xmath61 @xmath62 is the transition dipole moment of the solvent chains associated with the @xmath0 exciton@xcite and @xmath63 is the dimensionless operator corresponding to the displacement of the oscillator .    in the absence of electron - electron interactions and for only local monopole - dipole interactions the hamiltonian , @xmath64 , is the holstein model , which is widely used to study charge - density - wave phenomena in molecular solids .",
    "the monopole - dipole interactions imply that @xmath64 possesses a special type of particle - hole symmetry .",
    "in particular , @xmath64 is invariant under the simultaneous particle - hole transformation of@xcite @xmath65 and a reversal of parity in the boson operator , @xmath66    @xmath56 is the excitation energy of the @xmath13 exciton and @xmath62 is its corresponding transition dipole moment .",
    "these are determined by solving the single chain p - p - p model in the absence of monopole - dipole interactions .",
    "@xmath33 is the only adjustable parameter in the model , and is adjusted to reproduce the solvation energy of a point charge found by yaron and moore @xcite for particular values of the p - p - p parameters , namely , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath53 . having fixed @xmath33 for one set of p - p - p parameters the model can be transferred to another set of p - p - p parameters , by recalculating the unscreened values of @xmath19 and @xmath69 , and the solvation of states as a function of these parameters can be monitored .",
    "moore and yaron@xcite studied solvation effects in polyacetylene by surrounding a central solute chain by increasing numbers of solvent chains , arranged as in the crystal structure of ref@xcite , and extrapolating to an infinite system .",
    "the central chain was treated with a p - p - p model with parameters , @xmath70 ev , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ev ( corresponding to @xmath73 ev and @xmath74 ev ) and the solvent chains were treated in an independent - electron approximation .",
    "coulomb interactions were included between all chains .",
    "replacing the central solute chain with a point charge led to an estimate of about 1 ev for the solvation energy of a point charge . in the assumption of an infinitely fast dielectric , where the solvent polarization is equilibrated to the instantaneous position of the electron and hole , the solvation energy of a well separated electron and hole is about 1.9 ev . using a model that approximates the dynamic response of the dielectric , the free electron and hole",
    "become dressed by the dielectric response of the solvent chains to form polarons and the solvation energy drops to about 1.5 ev . using the _",
    "ab initio _ dft - gwa - bse method , bobbert and co - workers calculated a point charge screening in polythiophene of @xmath75 ev , i.e. @xmath76 for the charge gap@xcite .",
    "notice that for the parameter values used by moore and yaron the p - p - p model is strongly correlated@xcite .",
    "the triplet , @xmath77 , state is more properly described as a magnon than the @xmath78 mott - wannier triplet exciton .",
    "similarly , the @xmath79 state is not the @xmath80 mott - wannier singlet exciton , but a bi - magnon , whose energy lies below the @xmath78 singlet exciton , namely the @xmath0 state.@xcite the unscreened energies of a @xmath81 site chain are shown in table i.    we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) by the dmrg method@xcite using a program well - tested on similar electron - boson models@xcite .",
    "since the boson energy scale , @xmath82 , is comparatively large compared to the electronic excitation energies , we found that only one boson per site is required for the excitation energies to converge to within @xmath83 ev .",
    "the number of superblock states was typically @xmath84 and one finite - lattice sweep at the target chain size was always performed to ensure convergence .",
    "taking @xmath85 @xmath37 , @xmath86 @xmath37 and @xmath87 , we obtain a screening energy of @xmath88 ev for the point charge .",
    "this is intermediate between the values of bobbert@xcite and moore - yaron@xcite and is close to the charged - polaron result of @xmath89 for @xmath81 sites.@xcite the distance dependence of the charge - charge screening arising from the dielectric model of eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) is similar to that obtained from the explicit solvent model of moore and yaron@xcite , suggesting that the longitudinal dipoles provide a reasonable description of the dielectric medium .    .",
    "unscreened energies , the transition moment , @xmath90 , and the dipole ` polarizability ' , @xmath91 of a @xmath81-site polymer chain modelled by the p - p - p model .",
    "the energies are in evs . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ ta:4 ]    length scales also play a rle in the screening of the excited states and the charge gap . as the separation between a polymer and a line of dipoles , @xmath29 , is increased the typical distance in the monopole - dipole interaction increases .",
    "when this interaction distance is larger than the particle - hole separation , the charge character of the exciton approaches that of a point dipole .",
    "for the line dipole used here , the ratio of the screening energy of the @xmath0 state versus the charge gap is @xmath92 when @xmath93 @xmath37 and reduces to a roughly constant value of @xmath94 at @xmath95 @xmath37 .",
    "this indicates that a substantial fraction of the screening energy of the @xmath0 exciton is from dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "in this paper we introduced a dynamical model of a dielectric to investigate the screening of intra - chain excitations by the environment .",
    "this model consisted of a linear array of quantized longitudinal dipoles interacting with a conjugated polymer , represented by the pariser - parr - pople model .",
    "the dipole parameters are adjusted to provide a realistic model of the dielectric .",
    "the model reproduces the expected solvation energy of a point charge in these materials and sets the frequency of the dielectric response to the optical gap of the material .",
    "the model is one - dimensional and is solved by the density matrix renormalization group method .",
    "the one - dimensionality of the model does mean that it is impossible to include dipole - dipole interactions , and thus the model misses some of the physical characteristics of real dielectric materials .",
    "we make the following conclusions from our results .",
    "( 1 ) the @xmath0 exciton binding energy is typically reduced by ca .",
    "1 ev to just over 1 ev .",
    "thus , this relatively simple one - dimensional model of the screening of conjugated polymers by the environment predicts @xmath0 binding energies rather close to the experimentally accepted solid state values of ca .",
    "@xmath1 ev .",

    "one consequence of this symmetry is that the electronic ground state is associated with a manifold of ` vibrational ' states , with a spacing @xmath19 and alternating between @xmath100 and @xmath101 symmetry .",
