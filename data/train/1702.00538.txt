    "for one alive cockroach we observed a weak stable - in - time signal and this dataset is not included in the average calculation .",
    "for another alive cockroach we observed magnetisation revival after the exponential decay , see appendix .",
    "all measured dead cockroaches gave rise to a stable in time magnetic field similar to data presented in fig .",
    "the decay times have the average of @xmath1 hours .    in order to gain further insight into the origin of the observed magnetism we conducted a remanent hysteresis measurement the results of which",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_hysteresis ] .",
    "we model the observed decays with brownian rotations of magnetic materials .",
    "the variation in the decay times from alive and dead cockroaches is explained by post - mortem increase in viscosity of the environment of the magnetic particles .",
    "different ratios of initial magnetisation of alive and dead cockroaches follow from varying degree of alignment of the magnetic particles in the magnetising field .",
    "let us assume that the @xmath16th magnetic particle has magnetic dipole moment @xmath17 .",
    "initially the cockroaches are magnetised along @xmath18 with macroscopic magnetic moment @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the total number of rotating particles , @xmath21 is the mean dipole moment and @xmath22 is an offset value due to non - rotating magnetic materials .",
    "diffusion causes rotations of the magnetic deposits , and due to the random character of thermal forces components of the macroscopic moment orthogonal to @xmath18 vanish , @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath18 component decays as now the @xmath16th rotated microscopic moment contributes with the projection @xmath24 along the @xmath18 axis .",
    "it is convenient to first consider the contribution to the average macroscopic moment from the particles with the same volume . for brownian rotations the average cosine at time",
    "@xmath25 is well known and given by the exponential decay : @xmath26 , where the decay time , @xmath27 , is the inverse of the doubled rotational diffusion coefficient . for simplicity",
    "we assume spherically shaped rotating deposits and the decay time reads : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hydrodynamic volume of the deposit , @xmath30 viscosity of its environment , @xmath31 denotes the environment s temperature and @xmath32 boltzmann constant .",
    "smaller magnetic particles give rise to a faster decay and they also produce a weaker magnetic field as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the saturation magnetisation .",
    "the macroscopic moment is obtained by additional averaging over the volumes and reads @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the volume distribution .",
    "we take the exponential distribution @xmath37 , with @xmath38 being the average volume , and note that similar results are obtained with a log - normal volume distribution .",
    "the average macroscopic moment can now be integrated to the closed form : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denotes the modified bessel function of the second kind .    for the degree of alignment of magnetic particles in the magnetising field",
    "we treat their rotation as overdamped harmonic oscillators .",
    "this is a suitable approximation in the highly viscous environment and one verifies that our estimated parameters are consistent with this assumption .",
    "thermal effects are neglected due to the much higher magnetic interaction energy . in the overdamped regime ,",
    "the angle between magnetic moment and the external field ( counted from the field direction ) changes as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the initial angle and the alignment time @xmath44 reads ( see appendix ) : @xmath45 note the independence of the particle size . since unmagnetised cockroaches show no magnetic field , we assume a uniform in space distribution of initial magnetic moments .",
    "it follows that at time @xmath25 the distribution of angles is still uniform , but in a smaller range @xmath46 $ ] , where @xmath47 .",
    "this leads to the @xmath18 component of the macroscopic dipole moment being diminished by a factor of @xmath48 as compared to the value when all magnetic moments are aligned .    in our experiments",
    ", the cockroaches were initially magnetised for @xmath49 minutes and hence we use this number for @xmath25 in @xmath50 .",
    "the saturation magnetisation is chosen as @xmath51 a / m , with the order of magnitude matching magnetite and greigite .",
    "after magnetisation it then takes @xmath52 minutes to mount the cockroach container in the magnetometer during which brownian rotations cause partial demagnetisation according to eq .",
    "( [ mz ] ) . at this stage",
    "we fit the model to match the ratio of initially measured magnetisations as well as the decay times . as a result",
    "we obtain the viscosity of the environment in alive insects on the order of @xmath53 pa sec . for the dead animals the environmental viscosity increases markedly to @xmath54",
    "the radius of magnetic particles is typically in the range @xmath55 nm . two datasets could not be fit with a single exponential volume model but were consistent when a bimodal volume distribution was assumed with some particles exceeding @xmath56 nm radius .",
    "this is the case with the data shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_decay ] which intuitively can be understood as follows .",
    "the small particles decay faster and this combined with the effect of the large viscosity difference leads to the big discrepancy between initial magnetisations of alive and dead insect",
    ". however , this decay is too fast to match the experimental decay times and therefore larger particles have to be introduced .",
    "the obtained high values of viscosity agree with estimations for cytoskeleton inside cells , which was suggested to be a glassy material  @xcite . the origin of high viscosity in our approach can be traced back to the alignment in the magnetising field . in most of the datasets the initial field from the dead cockroach is below the initial field of the alive cockroach . since decay times of magnetic field from the dead cockroaches are larger than those from alive insects the only explanation is the partial alignment of the magnetic materials in the dead cockroach within the comparatively short magnetisation time frame",
    "the order of magnitude of the viscosity can be estimated from eq .",
    "( [ eq_align ] ) . for the effect of partial alignment",
    ", time @xmath57 has to be comparable with @xmath49 minutes and hence viscosity of the environment in the dead animal should be on the order of @xmath58 pa sec .",
    "the increment in viscosity of the environment inside alive and dead cockroaches follows from the expected physiological changes .",
    "the dead cells permanently dehydrate causing an increase in volume fraction of cytoskeleton which in turn increases environmental viscosity .",
    "our measurements are consistent with a viscosity increase of two orders of magnitude .",
    "the increase in viscosity has already been independently observed inside dying cells  @xcite .",
    "we note that the estimated size of magnetic materials is in the range of biogenic clusters of magnetic particles that were extracted from two species of termites  @xcite .",
    "this might not be a coincidence as termites are eusocial cockroaches  @xcite .",
    "they belong to the same order dictyoptera and have closely related symbionts .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasise that our experiments do not prove biogenic magnetism because environmental ferromagnetic contaminants could still be present in the tissues  @xcite .",
    "the hysteresis measurement ( see fig .  [ fig_hysteresis ] ) reveals a small value of the coercive field , @xmath59 g. this is typical for multi - domain materials or single - domain greigite  @xcite , but not single - domain magnetite found in various other animals for which the corresponding coercive field is about @xmath60 g  @xcite .",
    "we pursue further the hypothesis of single - domain greigite . ref .",
    "@xcite identified a black region in the cockroach , _ eublaberus posticus _",
    ", hindgut rich in metal sulphides .",
    "unknown organisms producing h@xmath61s were also found in the flora around the black band .",
    "greigite could form there naturally by reduction of iron in h@xmath61s rich environment with low oxygen level .",
    "since guts are well - nerved one can even speculate that cockroaches could sense magnetic field based on greigite deposits connected to nerves in their hindgut .",
    "some evidence already exists for magnetic sensing ability in cockroaches .",
    "cockroach mobility increases when it is placed in an earth - strength magnetic field ( @xmath62 g ) with periodically varying direction  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , magnetic deposits of sizes similar to our estimations were reported in the specimen of dead bees , ants and termites  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore tempting to conjecture that these deposits are responsible for magnetic sensing .",
    "our in - vivo experiments disprove this conjecture .",
    "although a single - domain greigite particle of radius @xmath63 nm has the magnetic energy in the earth s magnetic field almost @xmath56 times above the thermal energy at room temperature , the determined high viscosity causes its alignment time in the order of hours .",
    "this form of compass is hence too slow for biological purposes .",
    "other mechanisms might be responsible for magneto - reception , such as the radical pair model for which independent experimental support exists in cockroaches  @xcite .    in conclusion , we realised a non - invasive method of magnetic field measurements applicable to biological systems at room temperature .",
    "the method employs an atomic magnetometer with periodically moved sample .",
    "when applied to american cockroaches it allows quantitative estimation of sub - micron size magnetic particles in their bodies and clearly discriminates between dead and alive insects .",
    "we propose that its physical origin lies in the post - mortem change of the viscous intracellular environment surrounding the particles .",
    "more generally , this technique can be used to test physiological processes or gain insights into the study of stochastic processes driving the motion of biomolecules or magnetic tracer substances inside cells .",
    "independent of any potential magneto - receptive suitability , the characterisation of physical properties of magnetic particles found in biological tissues of various species , even in the human brain , is worth studying .",
    "it may help to establish their physiological purpose which is largely unknown and to distinguish biogenic precipitates from magnetic contaminants .",
    "alive adult female and male cockroaches were kept in transparent insectaria with unlimited water and a diet consisting of cat food pallets and photoperiod of @xmath64light : @xmath64dark hours . before the experiment",
    "the insectarium was placed in a @xmath65c environment in order to immobilise the insects .",
    "the experiments on dead cockroaches took place at least @xmath52 days after death and the dead cockroaches were kept in the @xmath65c environment to slow down putrefactive processes .",
    "the death was induced by a nitrogen gas atmosphere and thereafter the cockroaches were washed in an ultrasonic bath confirming interior origin of the observed magnetic signal .",
    "every immobilised or dead cockroach was placed in a plastic bag which in turn was put in - between two characterised permanent magnetic plates producing a field of @xmath66 kg at the cockroach location .",
    "the direction of induced dipole moment is indicated in fig .  1 .",
    "after @xmath49 minutes of magnetisation the sample was mounted on a motorised translation stage inside the optical caesium atomic magnetometer as shown in fig .",
    "we periodically varied the distance between the sample and the cs cell for at least @xmath5 hours .",
    "one period takes @xmath49 seconds .",
    "the recorded data - points are obtained by averaging over @xmath49 periods .",
    "each data - point has a magnetic field uncertainty of @xmath67 g .",
    "we verified that the bag alone produces a stable magnetic field over the timespan of our experiment ( @xmath68 g ) .",
    "layer magnetic shield to suppress ambient fields .",
    "after the light passes through the cell the induced polarisation rotation is recorded by a wollaston prism ( wp ) and balanced detector assembly ( d1 and d2 ) .",

    "[ fig_setup ] and described in detail in reference  @xcite for a similar setup .",
    "the highly sensitive optical caesium atomic magnetometer is based on nonlinear magneto - optical ( faraday ) rotation , where the polarised incident laser beam is altered by atomic cs vapour subjected to an external magnetic field .",
    "we placed a dead cockroach in between two n52 grade neodymium permanent magnet plates so that the applied magnetic field is oriented as in fig .  1 .",
    "by changing the separation between the plates the magnitude of the magnetic field at the cockroach position was varied .",
    "the magnetic field variation over the cockroach body is at most @xmath69 .",
    "the magnetisation time is @xmath5 minutes .",

    "the theory outlined in the main text explains an exponential magnetic field decay which was observed for most cockroaches . for this one insect , however ,",
    "we have seen a revival of the magnetic field as shown in the figure .",
    "[ fig_revival ]",
    "we verified that the food pallets given to cockroaches can be magnetised and therefore conducted the experiment with fasted cockroach in order to exclude the hypothesis that the observed decay is due to ingested magnetism of the food .",

    "we therefore fasted the cockroach for @xmath7 days , giving it only water , and found that this had no effect on the decaying magnetic field .",
    "this is not a conclusive proof of biogenic magnetism because environmental ferromagnetic contaminants could still be present in the tissues  @xcite .",
    "consider a spherical particle endowed with magnetic moment @xmath73 and surrounded by an environment with viscosity @xmath30 at room temperature @xmath31 .",
    "if the particle is subject to an external magnetic field @xmath74 , its rotational motion is described by the newton law : @xmath75 here @xmath76 denotes the angle between @xmath74 and @xmath73 ( counted from @xmath74 ) , @xmath77 stands for the moment of inertia of the sphere , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is the rotational friction coefficient , @xmath80 .",
    "the next term gives magnetic torque and the last term is the thermal torque whose influence we will ignore here because the strong aligning field of @xmath66 kg gives rise to @xmath81 even for very small magnetic moments .",
    "our aim is to calculate the time it takes the particle to align with the field , @xmath57 .",
    "note that @xmath57 is longer than the alignment time @xmath82 obtained when the magnetic torque is replaced by a stronger torque .",
    "similarly , @xmath57 is shorter than the alignment time @xmath83 obtained if the magnetic torque is replaced by a weaker torque .",
    "we show a simple upper and lower bound on the strength of the magnetic torque leading to alignment times that differ only by a constant factor of order one .",
    "hence the obtained formula also holds for @xmath57 .",
    "consider first the stronger torque @xmath84 .",
    "the problem reduces to the damped harmonic oscillator . due to the high estimated viscosity @xmath85 , the oscillation is overdamped with the general solution @xmath86 where @xmath43 is the initial angle and @xmath87 since @xmath88 we simplify : @xmath89 furthermore , both @xmath90 are negative with @xmath91 and therefore @xmath92 quickly decays to zero .",
    "the long time dynamics is governed by the decay @xmath93 , which admits alignment time : @xmath94 note that this time is independent of the volume of the particle as well as its initial angle .    for the estimation of @xmath83 consider the magnetic moment at the initial angle @xmath43 .",
    "since the torque tends to align it with the field , the accessible angles are from @xmath43 to @xmath95 .",
