    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most luminous phenomena in the universe .",
    "they are transient , intense flashes of gamma - rays occurring at cosmological distances .",
    "one of their peculiar features is the rapid variability in their prompt emission light curves . the observed spectrum is highly non - thermal and it is often described by the empirical band function @xcite that has a smoothly jointed broken power - law shape .",
    "the typical break ( peak ) energy is observed around @xmath3 , while the typical photon indices of the low and high energy spectrum are found at @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that the prompt emission is originated in an ultra - relativistic jet .",
    "however , despite the extensive studies in the past decades , exactly how the gamma - rays are produced within the jet remains unclear .",
    "optically thin synchrotron emission originating from internal shocks @xcite has been considered as a standard model for many years . in this model , highly non - thermal features showing a broken power - law and the observed rapid time variability can be achieved naturally . on the other hand , however , it is known that this model faces several difficulties . since the internal shocks can only convert the kinetic energy associated with the relative motion within the jet into the gamma - rays , it suffers from poor radiation efficiency @xcite .",
    "additional difficulties are also found in the spectra . a natural mechanism to realize clustering of peak energy at @xmath6 is uncertain .",
    "moreover , the synchrotron model predicts the low energy photon index at @xmath7 for the electrons in fast cooling regime which conflicts with the observed typical value ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "furthermore , non - negligible fraction of the observed bursts shows low energy slope harder than the death line @xmath9 which can not be produced by usual synchrotron emission @xcite .    due to these difficulties ,",
    "photospheric emission model is considered as one of the most promising alternative scenario for the prompt emission mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the photospheric emission is an inherent feature of the original fireball model in which the internally trapped photons that accelerate outflow to ultra - relativistic velocity are eventually released at the photosphere @xcite . unlike in the internal shock model , high radiation efficiency as well as clustering of the peak energies",
    "can be achieved quite naturally .",
    "recent detections of quasi - thermal component in the observed grb spectra provide a further support that the prompt gamma - rays , at least in part , are originated from the photosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "since thermal photons are expected in a simple photospheric emission model , it is difficult to reproduce the broad non - thermal shape of the observed spectra .",
    "hence , in order to explain the overall spectrum with the photospheric emission alone , an additional mechanism which leads to the broadening in the spectra is required .",
    "several authors claim an efficient dissipation around the photosphere can provide such an effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the electrons ( and positrons ) that are heated via dissipative processes such as shocks , magnetic reconnection and proton - neutron collisions can give rise to the non - thermal spectrum close to the observations .",
    "however , it seems quite questionable whether dissipative processes can operate efficiently to deposit the copious amount of energy in relativistic electrons ( and positrons ) .",
    "alternatively , recent studies have shown that broadening of spectrum can also be originated by the effect of geometrical structure of the jet . by considering a gradually decaying profile in the lateral distribution of the bulk lorentz factor of the jet",
    ", @xcite found that the typical low energy photon index ( @xmath4 ) can be reproduced by the photospheric emissions .",
    "similar to their approach , but with a larger gradient ( velocity shear ) in the lateral profile , @xcite ( hereafter , paper i ) have shown that , by imposing a sharp gradient on the lateral distribution , fraction of photons that cross the velocity shear region multiple times can gain energy via fermi - like acceleration mechanism .",
    "it is demonstrated that the accelerated photons can give rise to non - thermal tail above the peak energy which reproduces the typical high energy photon index ( @xmath5 ) of the observed spectra .",
    "however , how the structure of the jet is naturally regulated to such a geometry , which can reproduce the observations , remains unclear .",
    "in addition to the spectral features , polarization measurement may be useful to give a further constraint on the prompt emission mechanism .",
    "the first detection of linear polarization in the prompt emission was reported by rhessi from grb 021206 @xcite .",
    "however , independent groups did not confirm the polarization signals using same data @xcite .",
    "similarly , integral - spi and -ibis data showed detection of polarization from grb 041219 , but the results of spi and ibis appear inconsistent @xcite .",
    "the instrumental systematics are the main obstacles to obtain a convincing result .",
    "recent observation by gap instrument on board ikaros realized a detection with quite low systematic uncertainty @xcite .",
    "high degree of linear polarization in the prompt emission of grb 100826a ( @xmath10 ) , grb 110301a ( @xmath11 ) , and grb 110721a ( @xmath12 ) were reported in the observations @xcite .",
    "it is noted , however , that these results still suffer from low statistics , and @xmath13 polarization degree can not be ruled out at @xmath14 confidence level .",
    "future polarimeter missions , such as tsubame @xcite and polar @xcite , are awaited to provide more accurate data .    in order to use the polarization measurement as a probe for the prompt emission mechanism , it is essential to evaluate the polarization signal associated in each emission models .",
    "the polarization properties of optically thin models such as synchrotron and inverse compton emissions have been extensively studied by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "on the other hand , only few studies explored the polarization signals associated with photospheric emissions .",
    "first detailed study on this issue was carried out by @xcite .",
    "he solved a transfer of photons within a steady relativistically expanding opaque outflow , under the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "contrary to naive expectation , it is found that significant anisotropy develops in the photon distribution around the photosphere not only in the laboratory frame but also in the fluid comoving frame . due to the anisotropy",
    ", photons released at the photosphere can achieve high level of polarization through last scatterings .",
    "however , although the photons released at a local emitting regions can be strongly polarized , superposition of each emission component vanishes the net polarization in the observed emissions for a spherically symmetric outflow .",
    "therefore , to produce a non - negligible polarization signal in the observed emission , the emitting region must show a break of rotational symmetry around the line of sight of the observer within an angle @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow .",
    "this is indeed shown by @xcite who studied the polarization properties of the photospheric emission from a jet having lateral structure .",
    "the considered geometry is identical to those considered in their previous study @xcite which focused on the spectral features .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor of the jet near the center is approximately constant up to a certain angular width and an approximately power - law decaying profile is imposed at a larger angle @xmath17 . by solving the photon transfer , they found that a significant polarization signal can be accompanied in photospheric emissions originating from a jet with such a geometry .",
    "particularly , they showed that a narrow jet that has a steep lorentz factor gradient at the outer region can produce a quite high polarization degree up to @xmath18 .",
    "it is noted , however , that high polarization degrees @xmath19 can be detected only by an observer that has line of sight , hereafter called los , aligned in the outer regions .",
    "the emissions viewed by such an off - axis observer are much dimmer than those observed by an on - axis observer . moreover , while they showed that a highly non - thermal broken - power law shape of the spectra is an inherent feature of the emissions , the spectral slopes have a strong dependence on the observer position particularly at high energies and may deviate largely from the typically observed ones at a large fraction of observers .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the strong dependence of the spectral slopes on the observers can be reduced when a velocity shear regions are present at various lateral position of the jet .",
    "for example , if a velocity shear region is distributed within the entire jet , non - thermal photons originated at the velocity shear regions due to photon acceleration can be prominent for all observers .",
    "indeed , such a rich internal structure within the jet is inferred in a recent numerical simulations @xcite . in these simulations",
    ", they explored the evolution of the transverse structure of the relativistic jet during its propagation in a dense medium .",
    "their results indicated that hydrodynamical instabilities such as rayleigh - taylor and richtmyer - meshkov instabilities produce small scale filamentary structures that have sharp interface to distribute in entire jet regions .",
    "motivated by these backgrounds , we explore the photospheric emissions from a stratified jet that has velocity shear regions at various angular ( @xmath0 ) positions in the present study .",
    "main purpose of our study is to further investigate the effect of jet geometry on the spectral and polarization properties .",
    "analogously to paper i , here it is assumed that components with uniform fluid properties are separated by a sharp boundary transition layers .",
    "we show , in particular , that , when a velocity shear region is closely spaced within an angular scale @xmath20 , typical band spectra can be reproduced irrespective to the observer position .",
    "we also show that a high polarization degrees @xmath19 can be detected not only by the observers viewing dim emissions , but also those viewing brightest emissions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ model ] , we describe our model and numerical procedures used in our calculations .",
    "we present the main results in  [ result ] .",
    "discussions are given in  [ discussions ] .",
    "the summary of our main findings is given in  [ summary ] .",
    "in the present study , we evaluate the photospheric emissions from an ultra - relativistic jet with a half - opening angle @xmath21 in which a stratified structure is present in the lateral ( @xmath0 ) direction .",
    "we consider two types for the stratification : ( i ) two - component ( spine - sheath ) jet in which fast spine jet is embedded in a slower sheath outflow and ( ii ) multi - component jet which is composed of multiple outflow layer of finite lateral width .",
    "the schematic picture of the two models are shown in figs .",
    "[ modeltwo ] and [ modelmul ] .    in both models ,",
    "we assume a sharp transition layer between each component that has lateral width @xmath22 . as for the two - component jet model , the spine region defined as a region of conical outflow with a half - opening angle @xmath23 , while the sheath is a region that surrounds the spine and has an angular extension of @xmath24 . in the multi - component jet model ,",
    "two components having fixed widths of @xmath25 ( component 0 , hereafter c0 ) and @xmath26 ( component 1 , hereafter c1 ) alternately appear in the transverse direction . while the first component located at the center is a conical outflow with a half - opening angle @xmath27 , other components have sheath structures which have the same central axis .",
    "the repeated pattern of this transverse structure continues until the total angular extension reaches the half opening angle of the jet , @xmath21 .",
    "as described below , the properties of the spine ( sheath ) in the two - component jet model are determined in the same manner as c0 ( c1 ) in the multi - component jet model .",
    "hereafter , the quantities corresponding to the spine ( c0 ) and sheath ( c1 ) regions are denoted by subscripts @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the quantities without the subscript refer to all regions including the boundary transition layers .",
    "it is noted that the two - component jet model is introduced to clarify the effects of sharp velocity gradients on the resulting spectra and the polarization .",
    "main difference between the present paper and paper",
    "i is that here we include and quantify the polarization signal . on the other hand , multi - component jet model",
    "is introduced in order to explicitly show that the existence of sharp velocity gradient regions within an angular scale @xmath20 is essential to reproduce the typical observed spectra of grbs and to quantify the polarizations associated with these emissions .",
    "although the assumed geometry of the employed models is somewhat artificial , it is stressed that similar results are expected if sharp velocity shear regions are present in the transverse structure of the jet and are closely distributed within a small angular scale @xmath20 .",
    "such a rich internal structure is indeed inferred from the recent numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we will mention on this issue later in  [ multi ] and  [ stdis ] .",
    "we consider a steady radially expanding axisymmetric outflow , and the radial profile of the fluid properties are described by the standard adiabatic fireball model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the former condition comes from the fact that , at a radius far below the photosphere ( @xmath146 ) , the photon distribution does not deviate from the isotropic planck distribution and remains unpolarized , if velocity shear is not present ( see next section ) , and its temperature evolution is well described by eq .",
    "( [ tev ] ) .",
    "the latter condition is required , since the photons near the jet edge escape during their propagation .",
    "larger fraction of photons escape when smaller injection radius is assumed .",

    "however , it is noted that , while the dependence is strong for an observer that have los located outside the lateral jet boundary ( @xmath147 ) , weak dependence is found at smaller observer angle , and quantitatively similar results are obtained when the injection radius is set far below the photosphere .",
    "therefore , in the present study , we focus on the observers that have los aligned within the jet region @xmath148 and do not consider the cases for larger observer angles .    as mentioned above , circular polarization is absent and only linear polarization is found in our calculation , since the circular polarization parameter always satisfies @xmath94 . also , due to the imposed axisymmetry and the employed coordinate system for the stokes parameters ( fig .",
    "[ axis ] ) , the parameter @xmath89 vanishes after summing up ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we have checked this in our calculation and indeed found that the parameter @xmath89 converges to @xmath28 as the number of photon packets increases .",
    "the number of the packets employed in our calculation is sufficiently large to consider that this convergence is achieved .",
    "therefore , the non - zero stokes parameters are @xmath87 and @xmath88 . as a result ,",
    "the polarization state of the observed emissions are characterized by the two parameters and the degree of polarization given by @xmath149 .",
    "when @xmath88 is positive ( negative ) , the electric vector of the polarized emission is aligned to @xmath150-axis shown in fig .",
    "hence , the positive @xmath88 corresponds to the case for electric vector aligned in the plane formed by photon propagation direction ( los ) and jet axis , while the negative @xmath88 corresponds to the case for that aligned to perpendicular to the plane .",
    "finally , let us comment on the expected polarization signature in the stratified jet . as mentioned above , electron scattering of an unpolarized photon packet results in a linearly polarized outgoing photon packet",
    ". in thomson regime ( majority of scatterings in our calculation occurs in this regime ) , the degree of polarization depends only on the scattering angle @xmath151 , and @xmath152 polarization is found when @xmath153 .",
    "the electric vector of the scattered photon is perpendicular to the plane in formed by the incoming and outgoing photon directions .",
    "hence , emissions from scattering dominated photosphere have a potential to produce large linear polarization degree .    in order to produce non - zero polarization degree in the net polarization of the emitted photons ,",
    "photon distribution in the comoving frame must be anisotropic near the photosphere ( last scattering surface ) .",
    "this is because isotropically distributed photons do not have preferential direction in the scattered photon field , and all the polarization signal produced by the scattering will vanish as a whole .",
    "as shown by @xcite , anisotropy is naturally produced in a scattering dominated photosphere of relativistically expanding fireball . in a relativistically expanding outflow ,",
    "mean free path of the photons has large dependence on the propagation direction .",
    "the photons that propagate along the fluid velocity ( radial direction ) have larger mean free path than those propagating in other direction .",
    "this effect leads the photons to become concentrated in a radial direction . on the other hand",
    ", scattering tends to reduce the anisotropy by re - randomizing the propagation direction of the photons . when the photons are far below the photosphere , mean free path of the photons is small enough to keep the photons to be isotropic due to the latter effect .",
    "however , when the photons reach near the photosphere the former effect can be significant to produce the anisotropy in the comoving frame , since the mean free path becomes large . as a result , substantial degree of polarization ( @xmath154 ) can be found in the photons released at the last scattering surface .",
    "the strongest polarization is found for the photons that propagate in the direction at an angle @xmath155 respect to the radial direction in the comoving frame .",
    "this is due to the fact , that the photons are mainly composed of population that have scattered in an angle close to @xmath156 , since the photon intensity is concentrated in the radial direction .",
    "hence , in an laboratory frame , the strongest polarization is found in the photons that are emitted ( last scattered ) at an angle @xmath15 respect to the radial direction .",
    "the electric vector of the linearly polarized photons is aligned to the direction perpendicular to the plane formed by photon propagation direction and radial direction .",
    "it is noted , however , that producing a polarized emissions at a local emitting region is not a sufficient condition for a polarization signal to be present in the detected emissions .",
    "this is because the polarization can vanish when contributions from the total emitting regions are summed up . in an outflow that is expanding in a radial direction with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath16 ,",
    "most of the detectable emissions come from the regions within the cone of half opening angle @xmath15 around the los of a given observer . hence ,",
    "if the emission region is spatially axisymmetric within the cone , the emitted polarized signatures cancel out as a whole .",
    "therefore , in addition , break of the axisymmetry in the emission region around the los within an angle @xmath15 is also a required condition for producing the detectable polarization @xcite .",

    "therefore , the observed net polarization have a positive @xmath88 . as the observer angle becomes much closer to the jet edge , also the regions emitting photons having positive @xmath88 begins to be cut away .",
    "hence , it leads to the decrease in @xmath176 .",
    "the photon fluxes with positive and negative @xmath88 nearly balance at @xmath184 to produce unpolarized signature .    regarding the dependence on the frequency , the increase and decrease in @xmath176 tend to appear at smaller @xmath140 for low energy photons ( @xmath177 ) than those for higher energy photons .",
    "this is due to the fact that the photon with energies far below the peak is produced mainly at the regions more off - aligned from the los than those with higher energies .",
    "the contribution of off - aligned component becomes important at low energies because the doppler factor is smaller .",
    "here we show the results for a two - component stratified jet model in which the width of the boundary transition layer is infinitesimal ( @xmath185 ) .",

    "this is particularly important , since the energy bin is relevant to the recent and future polarimeters such as gap ( @xmath299 ) , tsubame ( @xmath300 ) and polar ( @xmath301 ) .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that a broad non - thermal spectra are produced in a photospheric emission from a stratified jet .",
    "particularly , it is demonstrated that a multi - component jet that has interfaces of strong velocity gradient closely spaced within a small angular scale @xmath302 can reproduce the typical band spectra irrespective to the observer angle .",
    "although , we only explored the cases of relatively narrow jet ( @xmath228 and @xmath303 ) , same results are expected for a wider jet , if similar structure develops in the entire jet .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the structure is more complex , we expect that the properties of the resulting emissions such as broad non - thermal spectra and high polarization degree are similar to the multi - component jet model . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear whether the structure of the jet is naturally regulated to such a geometry which can reproduce the typical band function .",

    "therefore , simulations that follow the evolution of the jets in three - dimensions with extremely high spacial resolution are required .",

    ", we have shown that the a significant polarization is an inherent feature of photospheric emissions from a stratified jets .",
    "recently , @xcite have performed a similar study on the photospheric emissions .",
    "the setup of their calculation is basically the same as ours , but the imposed structure in the jet is different .",
    "while we considered a multi - component jets having sharp velocity gradient in its interfaces , they considered a smoothly decaying velocity profile in lateral direction at the outer regions of the jet ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "as in the present study , they also found that a broad non - thermal spectrum and significant polarization signal can be realized in the resulting emissions .",
    "it is noted , however , in their model , that high polarization degrees @xmath19 can be detected only by an observer that has los aligned in the outer regions .",
    "the corresponding observed luminosities are much dimmer than that observed by an on - axis observer which views brightest emissions by an orders of magnitude .",
    "moreover , the shapes of the spectra have strong dependence on the observer angles , and can deviate largely from the typical observations in a wide range of observer angles particularly at high energies . the main difference from their study and",
    "the most important findings of the present study are that the photospheric emissions associated in the stratified jet model can reproduce the typical observed spectra irrespective to the observer angles , and a high polarization degree @xmath19 can be found not only in the observers that view dim emissions , but also those viewing brightest emissions .",
    "let us also consider the comparison with the synchrotron emission .",
    "the polarization properties of the synchrotron emission have been extensively studied previously @xcite . in the case of the synchrotron emissions ,",
    "configuration of the magnetic field as well as the structure of the jet determine the observed polarization signal .",
    "globally ordered magnetic field configuration ( e.g. , helical magnetic fields around the jet axis ) and wide opening angle of jet ( @xmath304 ) are favored to produce large polarization degree @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", the resulting polarization degree can be as high as @xmath305 at large fraction of observer angle including those viewing the brightest emissions @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , although high polarization degree up to @xmath306 can be achieved at higher frequencies , our results suggest that the polarization degree does not likely exceed @xmath307 at @xmath308 ( energy ranges that are relevant for polarimetry observations ) in the photospheric emissions . hence ,",
    "if the detection polarization signal is confirmed at higher level ( @xmath309 ) , synchrotron emission is favored for the emission mechanism of grbs .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the high polarization degree found in the synchrotron emission model is a result of the idealized assumptions such as ordered magnetic field and uniform jet structure .",
    "disruption of magnetic field configuration and/or jet structures tend to reduce the net polarizations significantly .      as discussed in",
    " [ prestudy ] , observations of polarization may give crucial constraint to the emission mechanisms of grbs .",
    "up to now , there are only few reports for the detection of polarization but most of the results are considered to be controversial , since instrumental systematics can not be ruled out @xcite . among them ,",
    "the most reliable measurement is provided by the recent observations by gap instrument on board ikaros . in the observation",
    ", they detected quite high degree of linear polarization in the three bright grbs which are grb 100826a ( @xmath10 ) , grb 110301a ( @xmath11 ) , and grb 110721a ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "if such high polarizations ( @xmath310 ) are confirmed at the high confidence level , synchrotron emission ( or other optically thin emission models ) may be preferred for the emission mechanism @xcite rather than the photospheric emissions as discussed above .",
    "it is noted , however , that the measurements have large uncertainty due to the lack of photon statistics and are still consistent with unpolarized photons at @xmath311 confidence level .",
    "therefore , robust discussion using the polarization measurement is not possible at present .",
    "future missions such as tsubame @xcite and polar @xcite may help to resolve these issues .",
    "in addition to the indication of high degree of polarizations , gap also reports on the time evolution in the polarization angle ( the direction of electric vector of the polarized emission ) in one of the observed bursts .",
    "when the observed data are split into two time intervals , a shift in the polarization angle of @xmath155 was found for grb 100826a .",
    "it is worth noting that this rotation can be explained within the framework of our model . as shown in ",
    "[ multi ] , the polarization signal @xmath176 has a bumpy dependence on the observer angle and changes signs ( @xmath312 ) rapidly within a small angular scale @xmath15 .",
    "since the positive and negative @xmath88 photons flux have polarization angle perpendicular to each other , the shift in @xmath156 can be result from the time variability in the jet properties such as change in the width of each component and/or bends in the jet which effectively changes the observer angle ( similar discussion is also given in * ? ? ?",
    "in the present study , we have explored spectral and polarization properties of photospheric emission from ultra - relativistic jets which have a structure in the transverse direction . for the jet structure , we considered two - component and multi - component outflows that have sharp velocity shear regions between each component .",
    "the fluid properties such as electron number density @xmath313 and bulk lorentz factor @xmath314 are determined by applying the adiabatic fireball model in each region independently .",
    "initially , unpolarized thermal photons are injected at a radius far below the photosphere ( @xmath315 ) . using a monte - carlo technique , we solve the evolution of the energy and polarization state of the injected photons via electron scatterings until they reach the outer boundary located far above the photosphere ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "below we summarize the main results and conclusions of the present study :    \\1 . while the majority of the injected photons escapes from the photosphere as adiabatically cooled thermal photons , small fraction of photons gains energy via fermi - like acceleration mechanism by crossing the velocity shear regions multiple times . as a result",
    ", the accelerated photons produce a non - thermal tail above the thermal peak energy in the observed spectra . the non - thermal tail becomes harder as the velocity gradient in the shear region becomes larger due to the increase in the acceleration efficiency .",
    "regarding the observer dependence , the non - thermal tail is most prominent when the line of sight of the observer is aligned to the velocity shear region .",
    "\\2 . the presence of stratified structure within the jet produces large asymmetry in the emission region around the line of sight of the observer . as a result",
    ", polarization signal is inevitably accompanied in the photospheric emission .",
    "the polarization degree tends to increase as the velocity gradient increases , since the asymmetry in the emission region is enhanced . regarding the energy dependence ,",
    "emissions at high energies tend to show higher polarization degree than those at lower energies .",
    "this is because the emissivity of high energy ( non - thermal ) photons has stronger dependence on the lateral position ( @xmath0 ) than that of the lower energy photons , since the high energy photons produced by the photon acceleration process are concentrated near the narrow velocity shear regions .",
    "regardless of the observer angle , photospheric emission from a multi - component jet can reproduce the typical observed spectra when the velocity shear regions are spaced within an angular scale @xmath20 .",
    "prominent non - thermal tail that has photon index similar to the typical value @xmath316 can be present at any observer angle , since the velocity shear regions are always located within an angle @xmath15 from the los",
    ". meanwhile , the spectrum below the peak energy is also modified from the pure thermal one , since any observer can view the thermal photons that are originated in the different components in the jet which have different peak energies .",
    "this multi - color effect leads to softening which can result in a photon indices similar to the observed ones @xmath317 .",
    "the maximum energy of the accelerated photons are limited by klein - nishina effect , and therefore the spectrum shows a cut - off at @xmath318 this is also consistent with the recent observation by lat/_fermi _ , which favor distinct emission components at energies below and above @xmath195 .",

    "here we describe how the polarization effect is taken into account in the scattering process self - consistently in our calculation . it is noted that the method is basically identical to that used in @xcite . in our code , each photon packet carries four - momentum @xmath320 ( or equivalently , the frequency @xmath84 and the propagation direction @xmath85 ) and stokes parameters @xmath321 here , the parameter @xmath87 is set to be equal to the total energy carried by the corresponding photon packet .",
    "the remaining parameters are always defined in a coordinate system in which the @xmath322axis is parallel to the photon propagation direction @xmath85 .",
    "we use the convention that @xmath323 ( @xmath324 ) corresponds to a @xmath152 linear polarization parallel to the @xmath325axis ( @xmath326axis ) of the coordinate system , @xmath327 ( @xmath328 ) corresponds to a @xmath152 linear polarization in the direction pointing at @xmath91 from the @xmath325axis in the anti - clockwise ( clockwise ) direction and @xmath329 ( @xmath330 ) corresponds to a full right ( left ) handed circular polarization . and",
    "@xmath92 have opposite signs compared to those of @xcite merely due to differences in their definition . due these this differences , there are also slight changes in the formulas of the differential cross section for the scatterings and the scattering matrix shown in eq .",
    "( [ dsdo ] ) and ( [ scmatrix ] ) , respectively , from those used in their study . ] as mentioned in  [ mccode ] , while the global propagation of photons is computed in the laboratory frame , the scattering process which changes the four momentum and polarization state are calculated in the fluid ( electron ) comoving frame .",
    "hence , in each scattering event , we first perform lorentz transformation of the photon four - momentum and stokes parameters from the laboratory frame to the comoving frame . then , based on the obtained quantities in the comoving frame , the four - momentum and stokes parameters of the scattered photons are calculated ( for details of the lorentz transformation , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "hereafter , we focus on the description of the calculations performed in the comoving frame , and all physical quantities are evaluated in the corresponding frame .    in fig .",
    "[ scfig ] , we show the coordinate systems that are used to define the stokes parameters of the incident and scattered photons . in each scattering event , the propagation direction of the photon after the scattering is determined based on the differential cross section of the electron scattering that depends on the polarization state of the incident photon ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while the klein - nishina effect is taken into account for an incident photon that has energy @xmath331 above @xmath332 , we neglect the effect in lower energies .",
    "hence , for a given set of stokes parameters ( defined in the @xmath333-@xmath334 coordinate system shown in fig .",

    ", we assumed averaging over the isotropic electron spin distribution .",
    "once the scattering angles ( @xmath151 and @xmath340 ) are determined , we update the four - momentum of the photon by replacing it with that of the scattered photons .",
    "then , we update the stokes parameter by calculating the stokes parameter of the scattered photon . in this procedure , it is convenient to employ coordinate systems that have their @xmath342 planes coinciding with the scattering plane to define the stokes parameters for both the incident and scattered photons ( @xmath343@xmath344 and @xmath345@xmath346 coordinate systems shown in fig .",
    "[ scfig ] for the incident and scattered photon , respectively ) .",

    "the rotational transformation of the stokes parameters is performed as @xmath350 , where @xmath351 is the rotation matrix given by @xcite @xmath352 using the transformed stokes parameters , stokes parameters after the scattering defined in the coordinate system that has @xmath342 plane coinciding with the scattering plane , @xmath353 , can be calculated by using the scattering matrix @xcite @xmath354 as @xmath355 .",
    "it is obvious from the above matrix that a photon with @xmath94 does not obtain any circular polarization from the scattering as mentioned in  [ mccode ] . to sum up , for a given set of scattering angles and initial stokes parameters ,",
    "the stokes parameters of the scattered photon are calculated as @xmath356 finally , we normalize the obtained stokes parameters so that the first component @xmath87 is equal to the total energy of the photon packet .",
    "since the packet is treated as an ensemble of photons having equal frequency , the change in the total energy due to scattering is computed in the same way as its frequency ( eq .",

    "the three @xmath90 coordinate systems are introduced to define the stokes parameters of the incident and scattered photon .",
    "the initial stokes parameters of the incident photon @xmath335 is determined in the @xmath333-@xmath334 coordinate system .",
