    "the properties of vector mesons are predicted to change in the presence of a hot and dense nuclear medium .",
    "especially interesting are the light vector mesons , namely the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6-mesons , because of their electromagnetic decay properties . their in - medium changes are reflected in the invariant @xmath0-spectra of the produced dileptons and",
    "hence their spectral properties are one of the essential ingredients for the calculation of thermal dimuon emission .",
    "this emission rate needs to be convoluted with a dynamical model for the space - time evolution of matter created in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "in addition , dilepton emission from a partonic phase and from four - pion annihilation are important thermal sources , in addition to non - thermal sources such as resonance decays or primordial drell - yan processes .",
    "a detailed description of the dynamical evolution model employed here is given in @xcite .",
    "the in - medium changes in the heat bath of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 at finite temperature and density are obtained by calculating the self - energies from the real and imaginary parts of the forward scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6-meson s in - medium modifications are not yet included into this framework .",
    "four pion - annihilation processes are calculated by lichard @xcite in an hadronic approach which is constrained e.g. by the recent babar data on lepton annihilation into four pions @xcite .",
    "we employ a quasi - particle model to calculate contributions from a thermalized partonic evolution phase @xcite .",
    "this approach is successful in describing the @xmath1 integrated invariant @xmath0-spectrum as well as the @xmath0-shape for the low and high @xmath1 data selection @xcite .",
    "while the success of the model to describe the shape in invariant mass allows for the conclusion that the @xmath5- and @xmath4-vector meson are considerably broadened in the nuclear medium , further information can be gained from understanding details of the transverse @xmath1 spectra in different mass windows .",
    "this is not only a consistency test for the model and the freeze - out prescription , but also allows for a better understanding of the dominant source in the mass region @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the dilepton spectrum is calculated as a convolution of the dynamical evolution with the local rate    @xmath8    which is inferred from the averaged virtual photon spectral function @xmath9 as @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the four - momentum of the emitted muon pair , @xmath12 is the temperature and @xmath13 is the baryon density , while the fireball evolution encodes information on the radiating volume , namely temperature , baryon density , local transverse flow and longitudinal rapidity as well as non - equlibirum properties such as pion- and kaon chemical potentials .",
    "finite lepton masses are accounted for by the appropriate additional factor .",
    "the role of transverse flow is determined by evaluating @xmath14 , see @xcite .",
    "the temperature @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ e - rate ] ) together with the flow field entering via @xmath14 sets the basic scale possibly modified by the momentum ( and density ) dependence of the spectral function @xmath15 . in the absence of flow and for moderate momentum and density dependences of the spectral function",
    "the thermal part of the dilepton @xmath1-spectra at a given mass would occure simply as a superposition of contributions from different @xmath12 weighted by the radiating volume at that temperature into the acceptance .",
    "in such a scenario the low @xmath1 region would be dominated by late , low @xmath12 emission wheras at larger @xmath1 the harder slopes of earlier emission from hotter regions will gradually become visible .",
    "the presence of a flow field ( which is essential in any realistic description of the evolution ) changes this picture .",
    "since initially transverse flow @xmath16 is small and @xmath12 is large whereas at late stages the situation is reversed , there are no cold emission sources without flow distortion , but hot emission regions are ( almost ) unaffected by flow . if @xmath16 is larger at fixed @xmath12 the @xmath1-spectrum becomes blueshifted and hardens , at some @xmath1 ( as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath16 ) this hardening becomes maximally and then drops again . since",
    "electromagnetic spectra are integrated quantities over the evolution , this effect has to be quantitatively averaged . an additional contribution to the @xmath1-spectra can emerge from the decays of light - vector mesons in vacuum after freeze - out . for this contribution",
    "we calculate the momentum spectrum of the @xmath4-mesons after decoupling using the cooper - frye formula , for details see @xcite .",
    "the na60 collaboration has measured @xmath1-spectra in three different mass windows , a lower mass window with @xmath17 , the @xmath4-like window with @xmath18 and a higher mass window @xmath19 .",
    "we present a calculation of both spectra and effective temperature in fig . 1 as inferred from the model . via a fit of the form",
    "@xmath20 $ ] with @xmath21 . ]",
    "there is a clear discrepancy between the model s prediction and the data in the low @xmath22 region for all masses .",
    "experimentally values of @xmath23 as low as about @xmath24 are observed .",
    "this can not be accounted for by flow characteristics . without flow and assuming a thermal emission",
    "the source would have a temperature of about @xmath25 , with flow the temperature in the radiating volume would be even lower .",
    "the strict anticorrelation of @xmath12 and flow in any hydrodynamically motivated model makes it very questionable that this low effective @xmath23 contribution could result from any thermal source .",
    "we will therefore not address the region below @xmath22 in the following discussion .",
    "the lower mass and the @xmath4-like region receive dominant contributions from the late hadronic evolution stages , especially from regions with temperatures @xmath26 and the vacuum @xmath4-contribution .",
    "this implies that the blueshift of the spectra s effective temperature by flow is large - it amounts to about @xmath27 which is larger than the maximum temperature variation in the hadronic phase which is only @xmath28 . in particular it is larger than the changes in effective temperature caused by the @xmath1 dependence of the spectral function in the hadronic phase - even neglecting any @xmath1 dependence of the spectral function would amount to a change of less then @xmath29 in slope .",
    "the difference between the low mass and the @xmath4-like region is caused by the contribution of the vacuum @xmath4 which receives the maximum amount of flow and predominantly contributes to the @xmath4-like region at @xmath30 .",
    "we find @xmath31 for that contribution .",
    "this puts severe experimental constraints on the flow field close to freeze - out and by backward extrapolation on the transverse and longitudinal flow fields also at earlier times .",
    "the interested reader can find a result of the calculation of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath0 in fig . 2 of @xcite which illustrate even more clearly the significant differences in @xmath23 as a function of mass .",
    "the prominent role of the vacuum @xmath4 contribution is clearly apparent from this figure .",
    "the higher mass region above @xmath32 is dominated in our evolution model by contributions from high temperatures .",
    "since this contribution stems predominantly from early evolution stages in which considerable flow has not yet been built up , the predicted effective temperature is lower than in the low mass and @xmath4-like region .",
    "this leads to good agreement with the @xmath23 data in the @xmath33 region .",
    "one can turn this argument around and generalize it beyond our specific evolution model : if one assumed that the source were predominantly from cooler hadronic stages , @xmath34 , and one would allow for adjustments in the flow field in the model to account for the observed @xmath23 in the higher mass region hadronic contributions would have to cease rather suddenly at around @xmath35 , otherwise the strong flow field ( required by the lower mass bins which are dominated by emission from those regions ) would push the @xmath23 above the data .",
    "even if this fine tuning were performed and hadronic sources in the range of @xmath36 contributed dominantly the substantial flow field needed is a strong indication for a higher temperature precursor state .",
    "this especially puts strong constraints on claims that four - pion annihilation processes might be the dominant source in the higher mass dimuon region @xcite .",
    "they can have considerable contributions to the yield only from emission at temperatures close to @xmath37 due to the growing fugacity factor @xmath38 with smaller @xmath12 .",
    "explicit calculations employing four - pion annihilation rates @xcite show that the dimuon yield from these processes is not enough to account for the observed yield in the mass region @xmath39 even if fine - tuning of the source is performed to enforce the compatibility of the measured @xmath23 in the higher mass region .",
    "we point out that this investigation only implies that the _ dominant _ source in the @xmath40 mass region of the dimuon spectra are not four - pion annihilation processes , it is still possible that these processes contribute subdominantly . for a more detailed discussion of this issue , see @xcite .",
    "one can therefore conclude that the significant lower effective temperature in the @xmath40 region is a strong argument for a dominant contribution from stages of the evolution which radiate with high @xmath41 .",
