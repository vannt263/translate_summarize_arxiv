    "@xmath0 cas ( hd224014 ) is a naked - eye variable supergiant star ( @xmath1 = @xmath2 , @xmath3 = @xmath4 ) with a long history of photo - visual photometric and spectroscopic observations .",
    "it was observed with the first near - infrared ( nir , 13@xmath5 m ) spectrographs in the late 1970s @xcite , but has been somewhat neglected since then .",
    "this paper discusses recent spectroscopic monitoring of the nir spectrum of this remarkable hypergiant star , revealing a wealth of remarkable temporal spectral features whose interpretation remains elusive .",
    "for example the cores of numerous strong absorption lines always appear double .",
    "the apparent line core splitting results from a static central emission component .",
    "however in certain variability phases @xmath0 cas also reveals a prominent optical and nir emission line spectrum that can indicate a common physical origin with the central emission components of split absorption lines .",
    "an important question to further address the peculiar nature of @xmath0 cas emission spectrum is therefore if the central emission lines and the prominent emission line spectrum form in similar circumstellar conditions ( e.g. at similar distances from the surface of the hypergiant with comparable geometric density distributions ) .",
    "detailed spectroscopic studies of the circumstellar environments of cool hypergiant stars are scarce , although they are absolutely required to properly understand the physical mechanisms that can explain their uncommonly large observed mass - loss rates . for example , can the large mass - loss rates observed in f- and g - type hypergiants , such as @xmath0 cas ( that are too cool to accelerate the radiatively line - driven winds of luminous hot stars ) , result from atmospheric pulsations , since their extended winds are too warm to be accelerated by dust - driven mechanisms commonly proposed in red supergiants ? can the observed properties of @xmath0 cas variable emission line spectrum be reconciled with the pulsation kinematics of the extended atmosphere and with its uncommonly large mass - loss rates ?    with a spectral type of f8-g2 ia0 (",
    "@xmath6 = 6500 - 7200 k ) , and a luminosity of log @xmath7/@xmath8 @xmath9 5.7 ( @xmath10 @xmath11 400 - 500 r@xmath12 ) , @xmath0 cas is one of a small sample of known yellow hypergiants in the galaxy . in",
    "quiescent variability phases the star looses mass at a rate of few @xmath13 , which is intermediate for cool hypergiant stars , but can increase by two orders of magnitude during rare outburst episodes @xcite .",
    "evolutionary tracks ( e.g. @xcite ) and possible membership to the cas ob5 association @xcite indicate a stellar mass of @xmath940  m@xmath12 and possible ages of 46 myr",
    ". observations of cno - processed abundances in its extended na - enriched atmosphere @xcite signal that this yellow supergiant has gone through dredge - up in the red supergiant stage , and is presently evolving bluewards .",
    "the star is about to cross the so - called atmospheric instability region in the upper hr - diagram : `` the yellow evolutionary void '' @xcite , where due to the enormous atmospheric scale height of these massive evolved stars , coupled with a large temperature in the shell - burning layers , the effective surface acceleration essentially vanishes , producing dynamically unstable stellar atmospheres .",
    "@xmath0 cas s atmospheric instability is manifested in both its quasi - periodic photometric behavior and unusual spectral variability .",
    "it normally pulsates semi - regularly ( srd ) with @xmath14 @xmath15 320 - 500 d , and an amplitude of @xmath16 @xmath17 ( @xmath1 band ) @xcite . once",
    "every 20 to 50 years , however , this hypergiant goes into an outburst by dimming more than a full visual magnitude , decreasing the @xmath6 by more than 3000 k , and by ejecting a massive gas shell .",
    "the most recent outburst event occurred in 2000 - 01 which was carefully monitored using high - resolution optical spectroscopy @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the nir ( 2 @xmath5 m ) spectrum from that exceptional epoch in  [ atem ] .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0 cas outside outburst is peculiar .",
    "optical studies reveal that the spectral lines are very broad due to large atmospheric micro- and macro - turbulence velocities ( 11 and 21 @xmath18 , respectively ) .",
    "the detailed profiles of certain lines are also rather complicated . besides the single - component weak absorption ( `` normal '' ) lines that are entirely formed in the supergiant s lower photosphere , the low - excitation ( @xmath19 3 ev ) absorption lines are either _ cyclically _ or _ permanently _ split ( depending on the line oscillator strength within a multiplet ) , having one component always blue- and the other one red - shifted relative to the stellar radial velocity of @xmath2047@xmath161 @xmath18 .",
    "a number of low - excitation lines appear in emission above flux level of the local continuum around variability phases of maximum light ( e.g. when @xmath6 becomes largest ) , while others , like the forbidden [ caii ] lines , peak always prominently above the local continuum level throughout a complete variability cycle .",
    "in addition , many medium - strong and strong absorption lines develop far violet extended wings during certain phases of fast wind expansion",
    ". they can sometimes also display a rather `` bumpy structure '' in the far short - wavelength wing profile of split absorption lines .    despite the fact that @xmath0 cas s peculiar spectrum was immediately recognized almost a century ago , its precise physical origin remains heavily debated .",
    "this is no surprise given that it requires an appreciable amount of observing time to acquire the substantial body of simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric data necessary to reveal a correlated pattern of behavior .",
    "the earliest interpretations of the peculiar line splitting phenomenon attribute it to two detached circumstellar shells previously ejected by the supergiant @xcite .",
    "various authors remarked that such shells possibly comprise two atmospheric layers flanking an outwardly propagating shock wave , a mechanism currently used to explain the absorption line splitting observed in a number of less - luminous variables such as rr lyr , w vir , rv tau , and miras ( e. g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite added support to the shock wave hypothesis for @xmath0 cas by showing that the line core doubling correlates with the pulsation phase , because the splitting is most prominent around maximum light when the photosphere begins to expand .",
    "they also argued that the line core doubling first starts in the high - excitation lines , as if a shock wave were propagating outwards crossing various atmospheric regions with decreasing @xmath21 .",
    "however , @xcite also considered a different explanation for the split lines of @xmath0 cas . instead of two separate absorption components",
    ", the splitting could be interpreted as a superposition of a single broad absorption line and a static central _ emission _ line .",
    "this proposition was based on the observation of the cores of some split lines that become so intense at times that they peak above the local level of the continuum , sometimes without any accompanying absorption , which also rules out a p cygni - type line formation region in @xmath0 cas .",
    "these effects were also noticed for the slightly warmer hypergiant hr  8752 .",
    "the emission can be better detected against the weaker absorption spectrum of this hypergiant @xcite .",
    "@xcite hence proposed that the origin of the variable emission lines could be in a putative extended chromosphere around these very luminous cool stars .",
    "further steps at discarding the `` shell hypothesis '' for the formation of split absorption lines in @xmath0 cas were provided in @xcite .",
    "they showed that 1 ) the observation of _ permanently _ split absorption lines in the optical spectrum , with components remaining at a constant radial velocity , would require two absorbing shells moving with positive and negative radial velocity during the complete variability cycle .",
    "two separate shells permanently propagating in opposite directions is physically excluded ; 2 ) the high - excitation lines considered in @xcite do not necessarily form deeper than low - excitation lines in the extended atmosphere of @xmath0 cas , and therefore do not provide additional evidence for an outwardly propagating atmospheric shock wave ; 3 ) the variations of the red- and blue - shifted components in the split absorption lines are not independent of each other .",
    "one line component always grows stronger while the other line component weakens .",
    "this effect can readily be mimicked by assuming a central static emission line superimposed on a stronger and broader absorption line that exhibits small doppler displacements due to the photospheric oscillations .",
    "further direct evidence against substantial circumstellar material around @xmath0 cas includes the non - detection by hst - wfpc2 of any significant structure at 0.1 or 310 au @xmath22 150 @xmath10 away from the hypergiant @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , tenuous and temporal circumstellar material may still be present as indicated by a weak mid - ir excess @xcite and the spectroscopically observed mass ejections during recurrent outbursts of the star ( e.g. optical tio band observations by @xcite and references therein to the two earlier recorded outbursts ) .    in this paper",
    "we address the important question of the origin and nature of the line emission region in @xmath0 cas .",
    "in particular , what are its thermal conditions and what is the geometrical extension and location of this region ? can the emission region and its line excitation mechanism be linked to the pulsations of the lower photosphere of the hypergiant ?",
    "we discuss several important clues from nir spectra of @xmath0 cas , but will also scrutinize new high - resolution optical and uv observations ( of which a more detailed analysis will be presented elsewhere ) .    while optical tio bands have only been recorded during rare outbursts ,",
    "the abundant co molecule is however always observed in the nir spectrum of @xmath0 cas .",
    "the nir spectrum was extensively monitored by sheffer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) with the fts spectrograph on the mayall 4 m telescope ( kitt peak ) from 1979 to 1989 .",
    "their intense monitoring program revealed substantial nir spectral changes on a time scale of only months @xcite .",
    "although the `` shell hypothesis '' can be abandoned for the optical split absorption lines , these authors adopted it to interpret the co line variability in the nir spectrum .",
    "unlike the optical atomic split lines , the nir co lines require kinetic gas temperatures much smaller than those adopted in classical photospheric models for f- and g - type supergiants ( for a comprehensive co grotrian diagram see fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the low kinetic gas temperatures ( @xmath23 2000 k ) required for co molecular formation at these early spectral types either require a temperature reversal in the upper atmosphere ( a model we explore in  [ shock ] ) , or must assume the presence of a much cooler circumstellar gas envelope .",
    "the latter interpretation was adopted by @xcite by attributing the short - wavelength `` shell '' component of the split co absorption lines to a moderate outburst of @xmath0 cas in 1986 .",
    "they further assumed the detached shell interpretation to compute the total mass of the expelled gas layer , its turbulent velocity , and the atmospheric deceleration during their monitoring period .",
    "nir co bands have been observed and interpreted as direct tracers of ejected stellar material in a number of other f - g supergiants .",
    "for example , @xcite discuss the molecular winds of post - agb stars , while @xcite investigate dust formation close to the stellar surface of r crb stars .",
    "given the difficulties to properly explain the properties of split _ atomic _ lines in @xmath0 cas , we argue that a `` shell hypothesis '' for co line formation needs to be re - examined as well .",
    "the early investigations by sheffer already indicated that despite the wide variety of morphologies exhibited by the co line profiles , they can nonetheless be reduced to a narrow central emission line superimposed on a broad absorption line , yielding two adjacent ( but therefore only `` apparent '' ) absorption line components .",
    "however , their study was not widely published or discussed , and only one fts spectrum has been discussed by @xcite . the major part of these exceptional nir spectroscopic data were only presented as part of a ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite .",
    "we present a collection of nir spectra of @xmath0 cas obtained with several telescopes in 2000 - 04 .",
    "our nir monitoring program is not as frequent as sheffer s , but has the following benefits .",
    "first , we present spectral analyses of new nir observations in combination with our ongoing optical high - resolution spectroscopic monitoring of @xmath0 cas since 1993 @xcite . next , while sheffer et al . studied nir spectra of the moderate outburst of 1986 , we investigate the major outburst event of 2000 - 01 . following the latter major outburst the long - term variations in h@xmath24",
    "reveal the formation of an exceptional p cygni type line profile since the spring of 2004 @xcite .",
    "cool supergiant stars often exhibit secular variations on time scales of decades ( for examples see  [ hyps ] ) and it is therefore important to continue accumulating spectroscopic observations of these unusual stars .",
    "although our combined spectra span the entire range from optical wavelengths longward of h@xmath24 through the main nir @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath3 bands , up to @xmath27 ( 4 @xmath5 m ) , the present study primarily concentrates on the @xmath3 band region where the first overtone band of co occurs (  [ covar ] ) .",
    "our high - resolution cgs4 spectral observations of 2004 september are motivated by the large variability of this molecular band observed in low - resolution spectra , and because it was detected in strong emission in 1998 .",
    "we also draw attention to the @xmath27 band region in the spex spectrum (  [ atem ] ) because , to our knowledge , it is the first @xmath27 band spectrum of medium spectral resolution presented for any f - type supergiant like @xmath0 cas .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "first we describe new optical to nir spectra of @xmath0 cas obtained in 1998 - 2004 , covering roughly four pulsation cycles (  [ obs ] )",
    ". then we establish the presence of emission in nir co lines and investigate their profile changes with the stellar pulsations (  [ covar ] ) .",
    "we discuss a unified excitation mechanism that can produce emission in both molecular and atomic lines , considering several explanations based on detailed co line modeling , combined with co - eval optical spectroscopy (  [ comod ] ) .",
    "finally , we compare our observations with the line splitting phenomenon reported in other cool star spectra .",
    "for example , we show that brightness declines of r crb stars appear intriguingly similar to the outbursts of @xmath0 cas (  [ discus ] ) .",
    "the comprehensive approach of our nir monitoring program enables us to investigate the remarkable evolution of the co 2.3 @xmath5 m band , and to provide credible evidence for the stellar pulsations as the dominant factor that determines the profile changes observed in nir and optical low - excitation spectral lines (  [ concl ] ) .",
    "we have collected a series of low ( @xmath28 @xmath9 300 ) to high ( @xmath28 @xmath9 40,000 ) spectral resolution nir spectra of @xmath0 cas covering roughly four pulsation cycles in 1998 - 2004 .",
    "our observations utilize three instruments on three telescopes  the cormass echelle spectrograph on the 1.9 m vatican advanced technology telescope in arizona @xcite , the spex echelle spectrograph on the 3 m infrared telescope facility @xcite , and the cgs4 spectrograph on the 3.8 m united kingdom infra - red telescope @xcite at hawaii .",
    "observations with the latter spectrograph were obtained in service mode .",
    "the datasets are complemented with two archival cgs4 spectra , one obtained in 1998 , one pulsation cycle before , and the other one right in the middle of the grand outburst minimum of 2000 - 01 .",
    "table [ table1 ] summarizes all observing dates and the basic characteristics of the new nir spectra .",
    "all nir observations are performed in a standard fashion resulting in similar data reduction procedures .",
    "a series of successive a - b sequences ( where a and b correspond to two positions of the star along the slit ) are obtained , both for @xmath0 cas and a bright telluric standard a- , f- , or g - type star .",
    "exposure times range from 0.5 to 2 s , usually restricted to the shortest time allowed for a particular instrument .",
    "the size of the entrance slit ranges from 0.3 to 2 , the allowed minimum to attain maximum available spectral resolution .",
    "to suppress the brightness of @xmath0 cas before saturation a neutral density filter is used with cormass and for the low - resolution mode of cgs4 ( both for @xmath0 cas and telluric standards ) .",
    "the flat - fielded a and b images are combined and mutually subtracted to perform dark and sky removal .",
    "the spectral orders are extracted , wavelength - calibrated , and divided by a standard star spectrum with removed intrinsic hydrogen lines .",
    "next they are trimmed and combined into a single nir spectrum . the resulting spectrum",
    "is then multiplied by a black - body spectrum corresponding to the spectral type of the standard .",
    "the wavelength calibration of the cormass spectra is performed using observations of the planetary nebula ngc 7027 obtained during the same night or the night before .",
    "the calibration of the high - resolution cgs4 spectra and the short - wavelength mode of spex employ ne - ar - xe arc lamp exposures obtained immediately after science target observation .",
    "the low - resolution cgs4 observations and the spex long - wavelength mode calibration both employ these arc lamp exposures as well as extraction of sky lines from the target images .",
    "an accurate absolute flux calibration has not been attempted for the obvious reasons of intentional flux suppression and strong seeing - induced variations between subsequent exposures of this very bright star .",
    "a number of important differences in our reduction procedures using different instrument / grating settings are the following .",
    "the 40 l / mm cgs4 observations require one additional step of correcting for a 2 to 3 pixel - wide wiggle in the flux level introduced by variations in the seeing conditions .",
    "it occurs when the detector is shifted in the dispersion direction between subsequent exposures to improve the sampling of the resolution element on the detector array .",
    "the basic steps for reduction of the calibration frames and co - addition of the target frames are performed with the orac - dr pipeline for the cgs4 low - resolution spectra .",
    "the spextool software package is used for the spex data which also performs the extraction of the final 1-d spectra @xcite .",
    "the cormass spectra are reduced with the standard iraf software package imred.echelle . the spextool routine xtellcor provides a modified spectrum of vega to perform telluric corrections in the spex spectra . for all other cases",
    "strong hydrogen lines in the standard spectra are interpolated with a straight line and removed using the iraf task splot .      in order to investigate correlations between behavior of co lines , the photosphere , and the circumstellar components observed in atomic lines , we complement table [ table1 ] with seven high - resolution optical echelle spectra obtained during our continuous monitoring program of the star in 2000 - 04 (  [ atomic ] ) .",
    "the spectrum of 2000 july 19 was observed during the deep outburst minimum with the utrecht echelle spectrograph on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope at the canary islands ( spain ) .",
    "the nominal wavelength resolution is @xmath28 @xmath1150,000 , with continuum signal - to - noise ratios exceeding 100 . for more detailed discussions about calibration procedures and a thorough analysis of the outburst spectra we refer to @xcite",
    "the spectrum of 2004 october 23 was observed to follow up our cgs4 nir observations of september 2004 that revealed strong co emission .",
    "it was obtained 5 weeks later , and about a week before the cormass nir observations , when the remarkable co emission had already started to decrease .",
    "the spectrum was obtained with the kpno 4 m mayall telescope using the echelle spectrograph configured to provide @xmath28 @xmath2240,000 in the red ( 6000 - 8500  in 22 orders ) .",
    "the wavelength calibration was performed with the th - ar lamp spectra , with a small additional shift in the zero - point as inferred from terrestrial @xmath29 lines .",
    "the other optical echelle spectra of 2003 - 04 were observed with the sofin spectrograph on the 2.6 m nordic optical telescope ( la palma , spain ) .",
    "the spectra are observed with the medium - resolution camera 2 ( @xmath28 @xmath11 80,000 ) with a wavelength range covering about 5000  over 42 echelle orders .",
    "each observation combines a number of subsequent exposures with two central wavelength settings until a minium s / n ratio of @xmath950 is reached .",
    "the s / n ratios for the echelle orders centered on the ccd can therefore exceed 300 in the wavelength region of the spectral lines of interest .",
    "typical effective exposure times are limited to 10 min . per exposure to avoid ccd saturation for this optically bright star .",
    "note for example that the large brightness of @xmath0 cas allows us to integrate high - quality optical spectra during dusk or dawn ( i.e. at the beginning or end of a bright night run ) with large zenith distances ( @xmath3050 @xmath31 ) .",
    "for some of our spectra it yields large air - masses ( e.g. @xmath91.6 for 2004 december 25 ) with strongly contaminating telluric lines , but which otherwise do not influence our spectral regions of interest .",
    "the sofin spectra are calibrated with th - ar lamp spectra observed after each science exposure .",
    "the standard echelle reduction steps are performed using the 4a data acquisition and reduction software package described in @xcite .",
    "special consideration is given to the removal of scattered light inside the spectrograph , and to the extraction of spectral orders including the removal of cosmic spikes .",
    "the wavelength dispersion solutions yield mean accuracies better than @xmath161  @xmath18 .",
    "the echelle spectra are not calibrated in an absolute flux scale , but special care is taken to apply the required blaze corrections for an accurate placement of continuum flux levels for continuum normalization . the local continuum levels are either determined with a polynomial fit through pre - determined anchor points in wavelength regions that are relatively free of spectral lines , or are based on a best visual estimate systematically applied to all of our observations . note that for these large s / n ratio optical spectra the accuracy of the placement of stellar continuum level is better than 1 - 2% , which is sufficient for measuring the small intensity changes we observe over time in weak absorption and emission lines (  [ atomic ] ) .",
    "due to a persistent lack of systematic libraries in the literature of nir spectra of warm supergiant stars , we observed cormass spectra of several bright supergiants for comparison with @xmath0 cas .",
    "the spectra were obtained in 2003 - 04 with a setup identical to that for @xmath0 cas .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows our low - resolution nir spectra of @xmath0 cas with less - luminous supergiants of similar spectral type : the non - variable @xmath5 per ( g0 ib ) and the 3d - period classical cepheid y aur ( f - g ) in two variability phases .",
    "hr 8752 is another semi - regular hypergiant which was the spectroscopic twin of @xmath0 cas in the 1970s but whose @xmath6 increased to above 8000 k since then @xcite . due to the low resolution of cormass it is difficult to determine if hr 8752 currently is an early a or f star , although it clearly reveals a phase with strong emission observed in h@xmath24 , pa@xmath32 and the ca  ii ir triplet lines",
    "the latter confirms the strong emission we observe in the violet wings of the ir ca  ii lines in 1998 october with not - sofin , although these lines also reveal a central strong absorption component in the higher resolution spectra .",
    "the h@xmath24 line in hr 8752 has a permanent triple - peaked emission profile which , unlike in @xmath0 cas , may be attributed to the presence of a faint b - type companion discovered with @xmath33 in hr 8752 . on the other hand however , the broad ca  ii h & k resonance lines of both hypergiants lack strong central emission cores , signaling the absence of a classical chromosphere in these cool hypergiants .",
    "the more detailed comparison between the two hypergiants is given in  [ hyps ] .",
    "the overall spectral energy distribution of @xmath0 cas beyond 1 @xmath5 m compares well with what is expected for a f - g -type star ( basically a black - body of @xmath34 @xmath9 6000 - 7000 k ) .",
    "it confirms the small reddening of only @xmath35=@xmath36 ( @xcite ) , of interstellar origin .",
    "the reddening is barely noticeable with a slight flattening of the spectrum shortward of 0.8 @xmath5 m .",
    "there is no substantial nir excess around 2 @xmath5 m as could be expected from warm circumstellar dust near the sublimation temperature of @xmath91500 k. the low surface gravities ( log @xmath37 ) of @xmath0 cas and hr 8752 are evidenced by strong o  i 0.777 @xmath5 m triplet lines in the low - resolution spectra .",
    "other enhanced lines observed in @xmath0 cas around 1 @xmath5 m belong to high - excitation transitions of c  i and s  i , and to low - excitation transitions of sr  ii ( the latter is also an atmospheric gravity indicator ) .",
    "these lines can signal high excitation conditions due to the low gas densities of hypergiant atmospheres , as well as a possible metal richness for @xmath0 cas ( @xmath38 log @xmath39=@xmath40 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath3 band spectrum of @xmath0 cas also shows co absorption .",
    "co nir bands usually occur only in stars of k - type or later @xcite and are indeed not detected in any other yellow supergiant of our sample .",
    "even more astonishing is the presence of strong co band _ emission _ in 1998 october ( cgs4 archival spectrum ) when the optical spectra of @xcite reveal atomic emission lines .",
    "the co emission can hence be considered as the continuation of @xmath0 cas emission line spectrum from optical to infrared wavelengths , prompting a more detailed search for other nir emission lines besides co and na  i.    in 2004 july we observe again a number of emission lines in the optical spectrum .",
    "we also observe the emission lines , including co , one month later with a medium - resolution spex observation .",
    "the most obvious emission features are marked in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . we identify them as due to a low excitation energy transition ( below 3 ev ) of ti  i at 1.04 @xmath5 m ,",
    "while the lines at 1.5 and 1.7 @xmath5 m of mg  i and of na  i at 2.2 @xmath5 m emerge from considerably higher energy levels above 3 ev in the atom .",
    "nir emission lines are more easily detected in f - g stars toward longer wavelengths because the continuum flux is weaker and is devoid of strong absorption features .",
    "we indeed observe a number of emission lines in the @xmath27 band .",
    "they are marked in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and wavelengths and fluxes are listed in table [ table2 ] .",
    "these lines can not be identified with molecular features observed in cool giants , such as sio , hcl , oh , or hcs @xcite . because of the sharp line profiles we think they are of atomic origin .",
    "we searched for candidate transitions with atomic line properties comparable to the emission lines we already identified in the optical and nir spectrum .",
    "we queried the atomic line list database compiled by van hoof ( url : www.pa.uky.edu/@xmath9peter/atomic ) but obtain for each emission line more than one candidate atomic transition .",
    "one resolution element in our @xmath27-band spectrum equals about four times the average line width of emission lines ( fwhm @xmath23 30 @xmath18 as measured from the optical and nir atomic emission lines ) .",
    "we therefore refrain from further nir emission line identifications until a higher resolution spectrum becomes available .",
    "we observe that the nir emission spectrum appears at least twice simultaneously with optical emission phases that also coincide with phases of maximum light .",
    "next we discuss the nir spectrum for a phase of _ minimum _ light , which also occurs during the unusual outburst epochs .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows a nir ukirt spectrum of @xmath0 cas during the outburst in 2000 october .",
    "it is observed in the deep visual brightness minimum when the star was @xmath91 magnitude fainter . to our knowledge",
    "it is the first ir spectrum of @xmath0 cas observed during a major outburst event . compared to",
    "our spex spectrum observed around maximum brightness in september 2004 , emission lines are not observed in outburst except for na  i 2.2 @xmath5 m , whereas the absorption spectrum is much stronger ( except for br@xmath41 ) .",
    "the na  i emission lines protrude through underlying absorption lines .",
    "the spectrum is overall compatible with the photospheric spectrum of an early k - type supergiant .",
    "the central depths of co , ca  i , and al  i lines , and of the na  i absorption lines ( and possibly also a cn band but which is in the noisy region of telluric absorption ) compare well with the k4-type supergiant 63 cyg in fig .",
    "this is in agreement with a @xmath6 estimate of @xmath114250 k obtained for the optical outburst spectrum in @xcite .",
    "the outburst spectrum reveals however a number of interesting peculiar properties .",
    "br@xmath42 is unusually strong for a k - type star with a central line depth only slightly weaker than in the spex spectrum of @xmath6 @xmath117200 k. on the other hand , h@xmath43 is considerably weaker during outburst @xcite .",
    "the low - excitation ( @xmath442 ev ) ti  i absorption lines at 2.17 - 2.23 @xmath5 m are also very remarkable .",
    "they appear somewhat stronger than in k- or g - type stars , in particular the 2.178 @xmath5 m line that compares better to the m2-type supergiant @xmath5 cep with @xmath6 @xmath113500 k. it is of note that these lines have been observed in emission in @xmath0 cas during a shallow brightness minimum of 1980 june @xcite .",
    "they were also observed in emission for a short period of about one month during the eruption of the famous light - echo peculiar supergiant v838 mon , while the object assumed minimum brightness and nir co was in absorption @xcite .",
    "we therefore propose that the strong ti  i lines in the nir ukirt spectrum of @xmath0 cas can originate from a 3000 - 4000 k gas envelope ejected during the strong 2000 - 01 outburst @xcite .",
    "we investigate the possible correlation of the nir co variability with the brightness curve utilizing all spectra available to us . the visual light curve in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is based on observations by the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) . although their dataset is less precise than other photo - electric observations , it is the only one available that continuously monitors @xmath0 cas from its earliest spectroscopic observations until our most recent observations of 2004 .",
    "we utilize the visual data to roughly estimate the variability phase ( maximum vs. minimum light , brightness increase vs. decrease ) as srd variables are not strictly periodic , but only quasi - periodic. note that the light curve of this pulsating star follows the radial movements of its photosphere .",
    "@xcite showed that the visual brightness changes mimic the radial velocity curve of @xmath0 cas after 1997 , with an offset of about a quarter of a period .",
    "the atmosphere begins to expand near maximum light and reverses to contract after minimum light , for example as is also observed in more regular pulsating stars such as classical cepheids .",
    "unfortunately , radial velocity measurements require high - resolution spectroscopic monitoring which is not available for all epochs of our observations .",
    "we therefore use the visual light curve as a proxy for determining the corresponding pulsation phases .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] plots the low - resolution @xmath3 band spectra of @xmath0 cas against the light curve .",
    "we find that the co band always appears in emission near phases of maximum light ( when the stellar radius already begins to expand ) and that the band returns to absorption soon after the star dims .",
    "the co absorption in the outburst spectrum of 2000 ( shown in detail in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) is only moderately strong , which is somewhat surprising considering the deep brightness minimum .",
    "however , at the low spectral resolution one can not dismiss the possibility of filling - in by stronger than usual ( residual ) co emission .",
    "alternatively , the weakness of the co absorption can be explained if the non - photospheric upper layers have been perturbed , if not entirely disrupted by the eruption .",
    "we further concentrate on the recent emission epoch of 2004 with the nir echelle spectra .",
    "the emission epoch started around 2004 may ( based on optical emission spectra @xcite ) and ended around october .",
    "the resolution of the spex spectrum is too low to resolve individual line profiles of @xmath0 cas , although it provides a very large wavelength coverage .",
    "we therefore obtained a cgs4 echelle spectrum , with r@xmath98 @xmath18 per two pixels , covering five spectral regions centered on br@xmath42 , na  i 2.2 @xmath5 m , and the first overtone @xmath45 2 - 0 band of co , from the bandhead at 2.29 @xmath5 m to 2.322 @xmath5 m , where the band begins to overlap with the @xmath45 3 - 1 co band .",

    "[ fig5 ] shows our nir echelle spectrum ( _ solid line _ ) together with a fts spectrum from @xcite ( _ dotted line _ ) .",
    "the fts spectrum was obtained during the brightness minimum of 1979 and reveals the co band almost completely in absorption .",
    "the echelle spectrum , observed on the descending branch of the light curve before brightness minimum , clearly harbors an absorption component in co as well , although the band is dominated by emission in the low - resolution spectrum .",
    "the detailed profiles of several co lines in 2004 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b , together with the na  i doublet and br@xmath42 lines .",
    "the prominent na  i emission lines are very symmetric and centered around the center - of - mass velocity of the star .",
    "the br@xmath42 line is in absorption and its core appears somewhat blue - shifted .",
    "the broader wings of this strong line extend to @xmath9100 @xmath18 in both directions , also observed in h@xmath43 .",
    "the co lines however consist of both emission and absorption components , with fluxes that systematically vary with the excitation energy of each transition .",
    "the low - excitation co lines ( with small @xmath25s ) are in strong absorption , while high - excitation lines ( with large @xmath25s around the bandhead ) are in pure emission .",
    "the co emission line maxima appear to shift redwards with decreasing @xmath25s .",
    "we think however that the co emission lines are always centered around the star velocity ( or slightly blue - shifted by @xmath467 @xmath18 ) and the progressive emission line redshift away from the bandhead is only apparent due to a strengthening of the nearby co absorption line components . with a fwhm of @xmath23 25 @xmath18 ,",
    "the co emission component is narrower than the na  i emission lines and appears round - topped .",
    "the absorption component of co is centered around @xmath47 = @xmath2080 @xmath18 ( or @xmath2033 @xmath18 relative to the star velocity ) , and has a prominent violet line wing extending up to at least @xmath20100 @xmath18 ( or @xmath2053 @xmath18 relative to the star velocity ) .",
    "a detailed comparison of the two co spectra observed 25 years apart reveals a striking transformation from deep absorption lines in 1979 to apparent p cygni profiles in 2004 . as is indicated by our low - resolution spectra",
    ", the transformation from absorption to emission actually occurs on a regular basis every pulsation cycle .",
    "sheffer s long - term high - resolution nir monitoring of @xmath0 cas offers a unique opportunity to investigate its causes by tracking the detailed evolution of the co line profiles .",
    "figure [ fig5]c shows a wide diversity in line shapes exhibited by co in 1979 - 2004 . for a full set of profiles we refer to figs . 5.15 and 5.16 of @xcite .",
    "when we correlate them with the corresponding pulsation phases and compare with optical line profiles , a coherent interpretation can however be proposed .",
    "first , the variations of both emission and absorption line fluxes are larger when the amplitude of the light curve ( @xmath38 @xmath1 ) is also larger .",
    "compare for example the strong co lines observed in 1979 - 81 and 2000 - 04 with the 1987 - 89 epoch when the co absorption lines remain permanently split . during the latter epoch pulsations",
    "are weak ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and the two absorption line components vary only slightly in intensity and doppler shifts . secondly , prominent co line emission only occurs near phases of maximum light .",
    "it is always centered within @xmath1610 @xmath18 around the star velocity . on the other hand",
    ", the co line absorption can both be either red- or blue - shifted , with shifts of @xmath2330 @xmath18 .",
    "the precise dependence of absorption on the corresponding pulsation phase however remains unclear .",
    "this is in part because the co line absorption obviously becomes filled in with variable emission .",
    "the outer atmosphere of @xmath0 cas is also velocity stratified and only loosely coupled to the pulsations of its lower photosphere , which can yield different doppler displacements for the co absorption and emission line formation regions .",
    "finally , it is important to point out that the properties and the time - scale of these co line profile variations closely resemble the profile evolution observed in optical atomic split lines such as the fe  i 5506  line in fig . 2 of @xcite . when one of the split absorption components strengthens the other one weakens .",
    "the double co core profiles can thus simply be interpreted as one broad absorption line with semi - regular doppler displacements , in which core splitting occurs when it passes across a static central emission reversal inside the line core .",
    "the broad range of nir co line morphologies in @xmath0 cas argues firmly against a p cygni line profile formation region .",
    "the co emission flux varies on time scales directly linked to the variability cycles of the photospheric aborption spectrum .",
    "this is unlike classical p cygni profiles observed in ultraviolet resonance lines of hot stars that are static and almost invariable in time .",
    "it signals that the major portion of the co emission line formation region is influenced by the recurrent photospheric changes in @xmath0 cas , rather than for example emission emerging from a very far extended optically thin circumstellar envelope that produces redshifted photons by backscattering in the far - side expanding hemisphere .",
    "the 2.3 @xmath5 m co emission can therefore not emerge from a ( possibly ) very extended molecular ( e.g. co ) gas envelope around the supergiant .",
    "this is further evidenced by nir co line profiles observed in hr 8752 , another variable cool hypergiant .",
    "@xcite observed that either only emission occurs in its co lines , or that it is accompanied by _ _",
    "red-__shifted absorption , yielding an _ inverse p cygni_-type profile instead @xcite .",
    "the 2.3 @xmath5 m co feature however vanished in hr 8752 in the late 1980s , approximately at the same time when its optical variability became much smaller and the effective temperature increased (  [ hyps ] ) .",
    "we now investigate where the co emission line formation region is located in @xmath0 cas .",
    "since the 2.3 @xmath5 m co band is not observed in normal f - g -type supergiants , neither the co emission nor the absorption components appear to be of photospheric origin in @xmath0 cas .",
    "the supergiants of our comparison sample however have smaller luminosities with larger gravity , and molecular bands can be strongly gravity - dependent @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath0 cas is a pulsating star , can the strong variability of the underlying photospheric spectrum cause apparent variability in co , as well as in other external spectral lines ?",
    "the strong correlation of the co emission flux with variability phase signals its formation close to the pulsating photosphere .",
    "we therefore adapt a numerical model of the average photosphere to probe a number of spectral properties of the co band observed in the high - resolution cgs4 data .",
    "every pulsation phase of @xmath0 cas requires an estimate of at least two photospheric model parameters : @xmath6 and log @xmath37 .",

    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "we obtain a @xmath6 @xmath49 6400 k for the spectrum of 2003 november , but slightly cooler for 2004 october .",
    "the light curve ( fig . [ fig4 ] ) shows that the star assumes maximum brightness between 2003 november and 2004 october .",
    "the star is dimmer in the @xmath1 band in 2004 october compared to 2003 november , which confirms the smaller @xmath6 derived from our best fit procedure .",
    "if one assumes that the co absorption component forms in the photosphere and becomes stronger with smaller @xmath6 , then the shallower co absorption band observed in 2004 october must result from filling in by emission which occurs on the descending branch of the light curve . in the following section we investigate whether or not the co absorption component forms in the stellar photosphere .",
    "we can also constrain @xmath6 from our high - resolution _ optical _ spectra . @xcite",
    "established a tight relationship between the equivalent width ( ew ) of the fe  i 5572  absorption line and the @xmath6 of @xmath0 cas .",

    "they confirm that the hypergiant was cooling down while dimming to minimum brightness ( after early spring 2004 ) , but it did not cool to below 6000 k. we can hence adopt a reliable estimate of @xmath517200@xmath16100 k for the spex and cgs4 emission spectra of 2004 september , and of 6800@xmath16100 k for the cormass absorption spectrum of 2004 october .",
    "we use a kurucz model of the photosphere with 6750 k and log @xmath37=0.5 to compute the first overtone _ absorption _ band of co. we adopt a value of 0.5 because it is the smallest gravity model available for this temperature .",
    "we perform lte radiative transfer syntheses of the 2.29 - 2.32 @xmath5 m wavelength region using kurucz line lists .",

    "these hydrostatic models of the photosphere therefore do not produce strong co absorption bands in f - type stars such as @xmath0 cas .",
    "the kinetic gas temperatures in the photosphere are too large to yield a sufficient co abundance , even in the low - gravity conditions of super- and hypergiant atmospheres .",
    "since we observe that the co emission variability correlates more strongly with the stellar pulsations than the co absorption , we model the emission with atmospheric layers in the vicinity of the photosphere .",

    "the modified model produces co emission when the @xmath53-minimum is placed below log @xmath54 @xmath55 in the column mass scale .",
    "the observed emission flux at the co bandhead does not appear to be influenced by absorption and can correctly be computed if the @xmath53-minimum is located around layers with log @xmath54 = @xmath203.1@xmath160.1 .",

    "our composite model produces the observed co emission flux .",
    "it however fails to precisely match the detailed shape of the complete co band .",

    "more sophisticated and detailed non - lte radiative transfer calculations of co would be appropriate in the very low density conditions of our model , but they are beyond the scope of the present investigation",
    ".    how can the temperature minimum required in these model fits be produced in the outer atmosphere of @xmath0 cas ?",
    "a similar atmospheric temperature structure has been proposed for the sun to explain the fundamental band of co at 4.7 @xmath5 m observed off - limb in emission @xcite .",
    "the solar co emission forms in the so - called co - mosphere , a transitional region located between the photosphere and the chromosphere at an altitude of 600 - 1000 km .",
    "this intermediate emission region is an inhomogeneous gas mixture with an average @xmath53 of @xmath113000 k permeated by chromospheric fingers of @xmath53 @xmath910,000 k. there is however no evidence of a classical chromosphere in @xmath0 cas : the most important stellar chromospheric indicators such as emission in the cores of the ca  ii h & k and mg  ii @xmath56 & @xmath57 lines have never been observed .",
    "because we observe the strong nir co emission only during variability phases of mean atmospheric expansion it may indicate an alternative dynamical mechanism that can cause temporal sharp structures in the temperature- and density - profile of the upper atmosphere .",
    "an outwardly propagating field of weak stochastic shock wave trains was for example proposed by @xcite to model the supersonic microturbulence velocities observed in the extended atmosphere of @xmath0 cas .",
    "the co emission could be produced by a pulsation - driven circumstellar shock wave in the cooling layers behind the shock front where the shocked gas expands while flowing into the following shock wave .",
    "after shock passage the cool co layers are heated by compression in the trailing shock which partially dissociates the molecular co gas fraction and quenches its local emission .",

    "although the emission spectrum weakens in 2004 october ( see the cormass spectrum in fig .",

    "we can therefore directly compare the nir and optical line shapes , within the same pulsation cycle and nearly the same phase , which is crucial for this long - period semi - regular variable star .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we overplot spectral features of @xmath0 cas with high - resolution spectra of arcturus ( @xmath24 boo ) and the sun ( both aligned to the rest velocity of @xmath0 cas ) , because their spectral lines are narrower and more symmetrical . these reference spectra permit accurate line identifications in @xmath0 cas whose lines are very broad and often blended or distorted with emission .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath6 of @xmath94400 k ( @xmath24 boo ) and 5800 k ( sun ) provide a useful estimate of the sensitivity of the photospheric absorption spectrum with the @xmath6 changes of @xmath0 cas , which can reveal the intrinsic variability of _ emission _ lines in different pulsation phases .",
    "we compare with arcturus and the sun despite the larger atmospheric gravity values of log @xmath37=1.5 - 2.0 @xcite and 4.4 , respectively , than in @xmath0 cas ( log @xmath37 @xmath9 0 ) because detailed synthetic spectra of cool hypergiants are presently not available . although there is no clear relation between all the spectral lines of these three cool stars ( e.g. strong absorption lines in the sun and arcturus are sometimes absent in @xmath0 cas ) , the comparison reveals that the diverse line profile shapes in @xmath0 cas are intrinsic to the peculiar spectrum of this hypergiant , and do not result from common absorption line blending .",
    "the optical lines of @xmath0 cas can be divided into four main types we discuss in more detail :    i. photospheric absorption lines of neutral and singly ionized metals ( e. g. fe  i 5572  used as @xmath6 indicator in  [ param ] ) .",

    "the detailed shape of each line appears to depend on the excitation energy , and to a lesser degree on the oscillator strength . disregarding all hydrogen lines and considering only lines with @xmath21 below a few ev , we find that the emission component strengthens while the absorption component weakens with decreasing log(gf ) .",
    "the na  i 2.2 @xmath5 m emission lines are the only exceptions because these moderate excitation lines do not show photospheric absorption in f - g stars ( * ? ? ? * our fig .",

    "note however that it has not been established yet if there is any physical difference between the type ii and iii lines , if they form in two separate atmospheric regions or even with different excitation mechanisms .",
    "the morphologic similarity of both line types is apparent with a smooth transformation from emission below the local continuum level in the strongest split lines to ( prominent ) emission above the continuum for the weaker type iii lines ( fig .",

    "other examples of these mixed line types are presented in fig . 2 of @xcite . based on the line similarities ,",
    "@xcite proposed that emission components in both types emerge from two circumstellar conic shells formed at the interface of a supersonically expanding bipolar wind that collides with previously ejected material from the hypergiant s violent mass - loss history . at the interface the wind velocity decelerates ,",
    "becomes subsonic , and forms a steady ( or standing ) shock wave in the outer atmosphere .",
    "a curve of growth analysis applied to optical multiplets of the central emission cores in split fe  i lines yields an excitation temperature of 3050 k for the shocked region .",
    "provided that these central emission lines are sufficiently optically thin , classical shock wave theory yields a thickness for the bipolar conic shells smaller or of the order of the mean stellar radius ( using an average mass - loss rate of @xmath59=9@xmath60 derived from the far violet extended wings of photospheric absorption lines ) .",

    "the doppler stability of the emission lines with pulsation phase results from the subsonic outflow velocity behind the standing shock wave .",
    "we however observe different properties for the type iii emission lines .",
    "these emission lines can appear sporadically in the core of unsaturated absorption lines and their shapes can alter while the emission varies with the pulsations .",

    "the bottom panel of fig . [ fig9 ] shows a spectral region with type iii lines in the same pulsation cycle .",

    "the emission line evolution resembles the blue wing behavior in the top panel of fig .",
    "the variations of the absorption line wing trace changes of the wind opacity which also enhances between april and october 2004 .",
    "the prominent type iii emission lines that peak above the continuum therefore vary intrinsically .",

    "the variability of type iii and nir co emission lines signals formation regions close to the pulsating photosphere of @xmath0 cas . but",
    "how close ?",
    "our model of the co emission places the formation region at only @xmath95% of @xmath61 because the gas density of the emission region decreases rapidly farther above the surface .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] reveals however that the _ optical _ emission flux increases together with the wind opacity determined from the far violet wings of the photospheric absorption lines .",
    "the properties of the stellar wind dynamics are determined by the photospheric pulsations and appear to be linked to the emission line formation region as well . if one could observe a time delay between the increase of the violet absorption line wings ( the mean wind opacity ) and the onset of the emission line spectrum , it would directly provide the distance the wind can travel between the stellar surface ( e.g. the base of the stellar wind in the photosphere at log(@xmath62 @xmath92/3 ) ) and the actual emission line region .",
    "a geometric extension of the wind to @xmath92.5 @xmath61 @xcite has been modeled from the photospheric absorption lines of @xmath0 cas , which would disagree with the much smaller distance we determine for the nir co. though , part of this difference may arise because our models for the co band emission assume a lte approximation which breaks down in the very extended atmosphere and wind of the hypergiant .",
    "if on the other hand one observes that emission spectrum develops earlier than the violet wings , then it would favor our shock hypothesis . to discriminate between the two scenarios , a very precise timing of the detailed line profile evolution using more frequent spectroscopic monitoring intervals will be required .",
    "we close this section with a discussion of the na  i 2.2 @xmath5 m doublet lines .",

    "it is thought that occultations by dense dusty circumstellar clouds cause the abrupt dimming .",
    "the dust clouds should occur rather close to the photosphere , dictated by the short time scales of the sudden brightness decreases . but how can dust form at photospheric gas temperatures above 5000 k in these f ",
    "g type stars ?",
    "@xcite observed the co 2.3 @xmath5 m band in fg sge , a post - agb and he - flash supergiant , two months before it went into a deep brightness decline , which turned it into a typical r crb star thereafter .",
    "they observe split co line profiles with one absorption component near the stellar rest velocity and the other blue - shifted by 21 @xmath18 .",
    "the co lines are interpreted as evidence of a long - sought reservoir of cool material forming near the stellar surface .",
    "after the first circumstellar gas shell forms at a distance of @xmath92 @xmath61 , the second shell cools below 1000 k and forms dust while becoming accelerated outwards by radiation pressure on the dust .",
    "based on these observations @xcite proposed that co gas might be the leading coolant initiating the nucleation of dust grains very close to the photosphere .",
    "however , a very recent extended study of r crb stars by @xcite did not establish any clear correlation between the appearance of the 2.3 @xmath5 m co band and phases of large brightness decrease .",
    "in fact , they model the observed co band strengths with pure photospheric models .",
    "their work points to a strong connection with @xmath0 cas for which we observe that the absorption line splitting is due to a pulsation phase dependent superposition of absorption and emission line components that recur on a regular basis , rather than being direct tracers of cool circumstellar material expelled during outbursts .    there are convincing indications that the trigger for dust formation is actually located in the photosphere of r crb stars .",
    "@xcite found that the photosphere cools by at least @xmath91000 k during the fast brightness declines .",
    "this atmospheric phenomenon is often neglected because of difficulties in interpreting r crb spectra observed at brightness minima .",
    "the absorption lines appear to weaken and to become distorted , possibly because the photospheric spectrum is blurred by the scattering from the expanding dust clouds ( although these effects are not clearly observed in @xmath0 cas ) .",
    "the atmospheric cooling itself appears to result from some kind of dynamic transformation or instability .",
    "@xcite ( see their fig . 1 ) observe that at the beginning of a strong brightness decrease in r crb the low - excitation photospheric lines reveal an emission component and become strongly red - shifted .",
    "the high - excitation lines in contrast become blue - shifted .",
    "this signals that the upper atmosphere decouples from the regular pulsation movements",
    ". the photosphere collapses , causing a stronger than usual compression , which in turn results in a stronger than usual atmospheric expansion with a large brightness decrease .",
    "a very similar behavior is observed during the 2000 - 01 outburst of @xmath0 cas .",
    "the event was preceded by a strong collapse of the atmosphere which reversed to expansion and subsequently cooled the entire atmosphere down by more than 3000 k. the larger brightness decreases in r crbs compared to the outbursts of @xmath0 cas are likely due to more vigorous dust formation around the former stars .",
    "the enhanced dust formation may be caused by the large carbon abundance and hydrogen deficiency of r crb atmospheres .",
    "whether or not there is dust formation during the outbursts of @xmath0 cas , it appears reasonable to attribute the sudden eruptions to a common physical mechanism operating in the atmospheres of cool hypergiants and r crbs .",
    "@xcite showed that the recombination of partially ionized hydrogen in @xmath0 cas , and the recombination of ionized helium in r crbs can effectively drive a runaway explosion over the time scales corresponding to the observed brightness declines of both eruptive variables .",
    "the eruptions are triggered by unusual thermal conditions in f - type stars during phases of very strong atmospheric compression causing a dynamically unstable atmosphere @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the stellar wind and oscillations can suddenly activate the trigger , which we observe is tightly correlated with the occurrence of strong emission line spectra .",
    "the study of strong transient emission lines in different types of luminous pulsating cool stars therefore provides important clues to the physical mechanisms that produce the large diversity of their observed light curves .",
    "r crb stars both in and out of the sudden brightness declines reveal many spectral similarities with @xmath0 cas .",
    "most noticeably the photospheric lines of r crbs are very broad as in f - type hypergiants @xcite .",
    "the lines sometimes split around phases of maximum brightness , which appears to correlate with the radial velocity amplitude . in ry sgr , having a pulsation amplitude @xmath1620 @xmath18 , the split lines occur regularly , while in r crb , having amplitude of only @xmath163 @xmath18 , they are not observed every pulsation cycle , except in the strongest lines @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 cas has an intermediate velocity amplitude of @xmath168 @xmath18 , between these two values .",
    "the brightness declines are preceded by an increase of the pulsation amplitude , observed for example in r crb @xcite , and in @xmath0 cas by @xcite .",
    "possibly , it is therfore no surprise that the emission line spectrum also strengthens during variability phases preceding the outbursts of r crbs .",
    "the so - called e1 group in r crbs represents transient sharp emission lines that are only briefly observed at the very onset of the declines .",
    "the e1 group may therefore correspond to our variable type iii emission lines in @xmath0 cas . on the other hand ,",
    "the so - called e2 group of emission lines has spectral characteristics identical to our type ii lines .",
    "these emission lines are sharp cores inside low - excitation absorption lines , and are permanently blue - shifted by 3 - 5 @xmath18 relative to the star velocity .",
    "they are apparently of constant flux and appear most prominently in the middle of the fast brightness declines when the stellar continuum flux significantly decreases @xcite .",
    "sharp emission line components above the local continuum level are observed during brightness minimum in r crb stars in forbidden lines like [ ca  ii ] and in resonance doublet lines of k  i ( 0.77 @xmath5 m ) and na @xmath58 ( 0.59 @xmath5 m ) .",
    "the narrow emission components however do not occur in mg  ii @xmath56 & @xmath57 lines ( at 0.28@xmath5 m ) or ca  ii h & k ( 0.39 @xmath5 m ) @xcite , which again compares to the observations of @xmath0 cas .",
    "near - ir na  i or co emission lines have never been reported in r crb stars , possibly because this spectral region has not thoroughly been investigated .",
    "the optical @xmath68 bands however are observed to appear in emission at the onset of the brightness declines .",
    "they either remain in emission or return to absorption around minimum brightness , although a clear correlation with the pulsation phase or phases of brightness declines has yet to be established @xcite . the two most significant spectroscopic",
    "_ differences _ between r crb stars and @xmath0 cas are the presence in the spectrum of the former and the absence in the latter of : 1 ) a strong he  i 1.083 @xmath5 m line with a p cygni profile ( although with notable exceptions for warmer @xmath6 @xmath69 6000 k stars as v854 cen ) , indicative of warm chromospheric winds in r crb stars @xcite , and of 2 ) a broad ( fwhm @xmath69200 @xmath18 ) emission component observed during r crb brightness declines in forbidden and permitted strong lines ( such as h@xmath24 , he , and metal resonance lines ) , which @xcite suggest can result from an accretion disk around a putative white dwarf companion star ( but note that a hot companion is not observed in @xmath0 cas ) .",
    "there is ample evidence from the literature that other long - period cool variables such as cepheids , rv tau stars , r crbs , and miras show absorption line splitting and emission lines above the continuum level around phases of maximum brightness , in atomic as well as molecular lines of co and cn @xcite .",
    "the line splitting phenomenon is also observed in hot rr lyr variables @xcite .",
    "based on the above discussion we think it is merely a matter of coordinating coeval optical and nir observations to firmly establish that phase - dependent spectral changes in absorption line splitting and emission line flux are related spectroscopic phenomena , because spectral variability is clearly linked with changes of @xmath6 in cool pulsating stars .",
    "these spectral phenomena are wide - spread among pulsating stars of various types in the cool part of the hr - diagram .",
    "they should therefore be attributed to radiative transfer effects that result from atmospheric pulsations instead of expanding circumstellar gas shells that are simply postulated by default for detailed calculations of mass - loss rates .",
    "considerable theoretical work has been published to model emission lines in _ cool _ pulsating stars . among all cool stars with split absorption lines ,",
    "the mira variables are possibly best studied with recent dynamic models of the atmosphere that quite well match the observed line profiles . in most studies",
    "however the apparent absorption components of split absorption lines are still interpreted to result from separate detached layers ( optically thick shells ) with different doppler velocities .",
    "the double line cores are simply assumed to have a purely kinematic origin @xcite .",
    "the alternative interpretation we propose with a central emission reversal inside the absorption line core is computationally much more challenging and has only very recently been explored with radiative transfer calculations .",
    "@xcite consider specific spectroscopic examples with fe  ii and [ fe  ii ] emission lines that occur in some miras only after exceptionally large brightness maxima ( or equivalently very strong atmospheric compression ) .",
    "they demonstrate that these emission lines can be excited in a confined post - shock layer close to the stellar photosphere at 1 - 2 @xmath61 .",
    "the post - shock gas is heated by the passage of a shock wave produced in the photosphere , which reaches this emission layer in half a pulsation cycle .",
    "for the shock to be sufficiently strong to produce emission lines , a minimum shock velocity of @xmath920 @xmath18 is required in miras . in an earlier study @xcite",
    "already demonstrate that adiabatic cooling of shocked gas can yield sufficiently small gas temperatures for the nucleation of dust grains within the same close distance of 1.5 - 3 @xmath61 from photosphere of r crb stars .",
    "the local gas density and shock velocity are the prime factors that determine the location of the emission zone .",
    "these models support the small distances of only @xmath231 @xmath61 we compute for the nir co emission line formation region in @xmath0 cas with a simplified atmosphere model in which the outer gas temperature structure is modified by a shock wave .",
    "some difficulties however remain when trying to directly apply the above models to the warm yellow hypergiants @xmath0 cas and hr 8752 .",
    "it should be remembered that radiation pressure on dust around the dust condensation radius ( at a few @xmath61 ) is considered to be the driving mechanism of winds and mass loss in all modern models of r crb and mira variables . in @xmath0 cas however , there is no evidence so far of significant dust nucleation close to the photosphere .",
    "the weak 9.8 @xmath5 m silicate dust emission feature and the ir spectral energy distribution place the dust envelope ( possibly resulting from the outburst of 1945 - 46 ) at 30 - 130 @xmath61 from the star @xcite . new ir photometry and spectroscopy after the 2000 - 01 outburst would help to further determine the properties of circumstellar dust in @xmath0 cas .",
    "furthermore , some constraints from our nir co emission models can be used to estimate the velocity of the shock wave near @xmath0 cas .",
    "when index 1 denotes the pre - shock ( upstream ) gas conditions @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , and index 2 the post - shock ( downstream ) conditions ( with jump conditions across a compression shock surface : @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 ) , the speed of the shock @xmath76 can be expressed through the local adiabatic speed of sound and the mach number : @xmath77 . for a specific heat ratio of ideal monatomic gas of @xmath78 ( assuming hydrogen gas ) to @xmath79 ( for co gas with rotational degrees of freedom ) and the mean gas - pressure and -density structures of our atmosphere model (  [ shock ] ) , we compute @xmath80=@xmath81 = 7.5 - 7 @xmath18 .",
    "the pre - shock mach number @xmath82 can be computed with the classical rankine - hugoniot jump relations in polytropic gas which are a function of @xmath41 and @xmath83 only . for @xmath84 k ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) we compute @xmath82 = 1.30 - 1.36 .",
    "we thus obtain a shock velocity of @xmath76 @xmath910 @xmath18 . this value is smaller than the 20 @xmath18 threshold velocity required in the shock models to excite atomic emission lines , and",
    "yet they are observed every pulsation cycle in @xmath0 cas .",
    "10 @xmath18 is in fact only a lower limit , since @xmath85 ( the gas temperature of the post - shock region ) can be much larger than 4200 k we adopt from the unperturbed model atmosphere .",
    "on the other hand , the non - detection of dust formation in the vicinity of the photosphere of @xmath0 cas appears consistent with the small velocity ( or mach number ) of the shock wave(s ) .",
    "@xcite conducted a large survey of the absorption line doubling phenomenon in long - period variables .",
    "they demonstrate that it is more frequently observed among stars with compact rather than extended atmospheres , and interpret it to result from stronger shock waves in the former stars .",
    "hypergiants such as @xmath0 cas and hr 8752 with their enormous stellar radii of several hundreds of r@xmath12 do clearly not follow this trend . on the contrary , hr",
    "8752 has become more compact as @xmath6 has dramatically increased over the past 30 years , but the split absorption lines are presently no longer observed in its optical spectrum compared to the 1970s .",
    "if the line broadening of these split lines were solely due to a superposition of two absorption components emerging from two separate gas layers above and below the shock surface , predicted with models of miras , the width of these lines would have to decrease with the disappearance of the shock waves in the atmosphere of hr 8752 .",
    "this is however not observed because the photospheric lines typical of a hypergiant spectrum have stayed very broad .",
    "our model for the central emission excited by a propagating shock wave possesses some difficulties as well .",
    "a shock wave propagating supersonically in the stellar rest frame should produce red - shifted co line emission ( provided the emission is sufficiently optically thick ) , which we do not observe .",
    "another problem is that a transient and spatially rather narrow atmospheric structure required for the co emission can not readily account for the permanent excitation of other static ( and apparently centered around stellar rest ) atomic emission lines in our high resolution spectra .    in summary",
    ", none of the available theoretical models of the atmospheric dynamics can coherently explain the absorption line splitting and line emission phenomenon in pulsating cool supergiants .",
    "the field of research is making rapid progress however .",
    "the current investigation shows that the correct answer may be obtained with the development of a new generation of atmospheric models that couple the dynamics of the atmosphere with non - lte excitation of spectral lines in shock waves .",
    "we describe a high - resolution spectroscopic study of one of the most luminous cool stars in the galaxy , the bright yellow hypergiant @xmath0 cas .",
    "our observations cover a complete pulsation cycle in 2003 - 04 over a large wavelength range from the optical to @xmath94 @xmath5 m .",
    "near - ir spectroscopic studies of yellow supergiants are scarce , and we demonstrate that the emission lines they harbor serve as powerful diagnostics of the important atmospheric processes of mass loss and pulsation in massive stars . in particular , we identify several prominent emission lines in the @xmath27 band spectrum observed near maximum brightness , and present @xmath3-band spectra obtained during the last grand outburst of the enigmatic hypergiant in 2000 - 01 .",
    "we primarily investigate the first overtone band of co at 2.3 @xmath5 m because it occurs prominently in emission during certain variability phases of @xmath0 cas .",
    "the nir co band is believed to originate from expanding shells and to trigger the formation of dust close to the photosphere of r crb stars .",
    "we confirm the findings of @xcite that the co band in @xmath0 cas is variable and consists of absorption and emission line components .",
    "however , based on detailed comparisons with atomic lines and correlating all spectroscopic observations with the corresponding pulsation phases , we argue that the ` split ' absorption line profiles are not caused by two separately ejected shells during rare outbursts of the hypergiant , but rather are a commonly observed combination of a static narrow central emission line superimposed on the core of a broad absorption line .",
    "the absorption line exhibits doppler displacements due to the atmospheric pulsations , while the emission component is always centered around the stellar rest velocity .",
    "the flux of the central emission line varies with the pulsations of the photosphere and rises above the continuum level around maximum brightness during phases of fast atmospheric expansion .",
    "after the phase of minimum brightness the emission flux decreases and the lines fade .",
    "detailed comparisons of nir co line profiles with low - excitation atomic lines reveal that they are intermediate between the type ii and type iii lines of @xmath0 cas ( according our terminology ) . while co absorption components are always present and vary similarly to permanently split atomic absorption lines ( type ii ) , the large variability of the superimposed co emission components suggests they are more compatible with type iii emission lines that can appear above the level of the stellar continuum flux . in other words ,",
    "the excitation mechanism of prominent atomic emission lines and co emission we observe in @xmath0 cas can have a common physical origin .",
    "the strong correlation of the nir co emission flux we observe with the radial velocity curve from photospheric pulsations signals that the co emission lines form in the vicinity of the photosphere .",
    "we model the co emission band spectra by inserting a cool gas layer of @xmath53 @xmath92500 k in the kinetic gas temperature structure of a plane - parallel hydrostatic kurucz model of the photosphere with @xmath6 = 7250 k and log @xmath37 = 0.5 .",
    "we fit the observed emission flux around the co bandhead , which is least influenced by absorption , with radiative transfer calculations to constrain the optical depth of the cool co layer .",
    "we determine an atmospheric column mass along the line of sight of 10@xmath86 g @xmath87 .",
    "it translates to a geometric distance for the cool co layer of only @xmath95% of @xmath61 above the photosphere .",

    "the most remarkable are : 1 ) when several epochs of observations are available the nir co emission flux is always observed to vary ; 2 ) the co emission flux is largest around maximum brightness , also observed in prominent atomic emission lines ; 3 ) prominent emission lines and split absorption lines are more frequently observed in stars with larger pulsation amplitudes or with larger radial velocity amplitudes ; 4 ) the onset of ( sudden ) strong brightness decreases in @xmath0 cas and r crb stars results from a stronger than usual compression of the photosphere followed by a stronger than usual expansion and cooling of the entire atmosphere with the appearance of the type iii variable emission lines we propose are analogous to type e1 emission lines observed in r crb stars ; 5 ) during the fast brightness declines of outbursts the initial emission line spectrum is replaced by another type of emission line , the so - called e2 lines in r crb stars , and in @xmath0 cas the type ii emission line cores of split absorption lines .",
    "we propose that the latter types of emission lines are always present but become more obvious during fast brightness declines because the mean photospheric flux suddenly decreases .    in summary",
    ", we identify two groups of narrow emission lines with fwhm @xmath50 50 @xmath18 that coexist in the spectra of low - gravity pulsating stars .",
    "the first group consists of atomic lines that appear to be intrinsically invariable ( types ii and iv in our terminology ) .",
    "the second group consists of atomic and co emission lines that are intrinsically variable ( type iii ) .",
    "both groups are low - excitation lines with @xmath21 of the order of few ev having doppler velocities of @xmath95 @xmath18 around the stellar rest velocity .",
    "the excitation of both groups appears to be related in one way or another to the atmospheric pulsations .",
    "the best interpretation we can propose based on our spectroscopic observations is that the first group is excited in two static conic regions @xmath910 - 100 @xmath61 above the photosphere @xcite , where the supersonic wind of @xmath0 cas collides with circumstellar material ( and possibly replenished by recurrent outbursts ) forming a permanently standing shock wave .",
    "the second group of emission lines is excited in a short - lived circumstellar cool gas layer in the immediate vicinity of the photosphere less than 1 @xmath61 away , that is excited by the passage of a pulsation - driven shock wave",
    ".    the following list of observations would be helpful to further verify our interpretations :    1 .",
    "very high - resolution spectroscopic observations ( @xmath28 @xmath88 100,000 ) of type ii and iii emission lines in @xmath0 cas to search for possible differences in radial velocity and line profile shapes between both groups .",
    "the observations could confirm if the emission lines form in two spatially separate regions in the circumstellar environment of the hypergiant ; 2 .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopic observations beyond 3 @xmath5 m to identify and investigate the properties of other prominent emission lines expected in this wavelength region ; 3 .",
    "monitoring of the _ fundamental _ band of co at 4.6 @xmath5 m to determine how far out the photospheric pulsations and shock waves propagate into the circumstellar environment ; 4 .",
    "new observations of the silicate 9.8 @xmath5 m dust emission feature after the outburst of 2000 - 01 .",
    "near- and far - ir photometry can establish if @xmath0 cas produces dust during the large brightness decreases of outbursts .",
    "it can further link its remarkable atmospheric dynamics to that of other eruptive variable stars ; 5 .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopic monitoring of nir co and split absorption lines in other late - type stars .",
    "in particular , observations of semi - regular pulsating variables ( e.g. rv tau , r crb stars ) can test the relative importance of the pulsations versus @xmath6 for sustaining the cool gas layers that produce the peculiar emission line spectra .",
    "we would like to thank all the observers who helped to obtain the nir spectra .",
    "we also thank staff at vatican obs .",
    ", steward obs . , and the cormass group for providing observing time and support during ng s visits to vatt .",
    "the service mode observing group at ukirt is thanked for their timely observations , help with retrieving archival data , and advice on the data reduction .",
    "we thank the aavso international database maintainers , with contributions from many observers worldwide to the light curve of @xmath0 cas .",

    "<S> we report on multi - epoch optical and near - infrared spectroscopy around the first overtone ro - vibrational band of co in the pulsating yellow hypergiant @xmath0 cas , one of the most massive stars in the galaxy and a candidate sn ii progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the double cores of the co absorption lines , that have previously been attributed to separate circumstellar shells expelled during its recurrent outbursts , result in fact from a superposition of a wide absorption line and a narrow central emission line . </S>",
    "<S> the co line doubling returns over subsequent pulsation cycles , where the superposed line emission assumes its largest intensity near phases of maximum light . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the morphology and behavior of the co band closely resemble the remarkable `` line - splitting phenomenon '' also observed in optical low - excitation atomic lines . </S>",
    "<S> based on radiative transport calculations we present a simplified model of the near - ir co emission emerging from cooler atmospheric layers in the immediate vicinity of the photosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the kinetic temperature minimum in our model results from a periodical pulsation - driven shock wave . </S>",
    "<S> we further discuss a number of alternative explanations for the origin of the ubiquitous emission line spectrum , possibly due to a quasi - chromosphere or a steady shock wave at the interface of a fast expanding wind and the ism . </S>",
    "<S> we present a number of interesting spectroscopic similarities between @xmath0 cas and other types of cool variable supergiants such as the rv tau and r crb stars . </S>",
    "<S> we further propose a possibly common mechanism for the enigmatic outburst behavior of these luminous pulsating cool stars . </S>"
