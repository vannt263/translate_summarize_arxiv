    "extraction of @xmath2 information , such as pole positions and vertex form factors , is an important task in hadron physics .",
    "this is because they are necessary information to address a question whether we can understand baryon resonances within qcd . in order to extract the @xmath2 information ,",
    "first , one needs to construct a reaction model through a comprehensive analysis of data .",
    "then , pole positions and vertex form factors are extracted from the model with the use of the analytic continuation .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 information extracted in this manner is inevitably model - dependent .",
    "there are several different approaches to extract the @xmath2 information .",
    "although almost all 4-stars nucleon resonances listed by particle data group ( pdg ) are found in all approaches , existence of some @xmath2 states , in particular those in the higher mass region , is controversial .",
    "thus , commonly asked questions are how much model - dependent the extracted resonance parameters are , and how precise data have to be for a stable resonance extraction .",
    "these are the questions we would like to address in this work@xcite , within a dynamical coupled - channels model ( ebac - dcc )  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the @xmath1 @xmath0 partial wave and the stability of its pole positions , particularly those corresponding to the roper resonance . in the region near roper @xmath3 , two poles close to the @xmath4 threshold were found in our recent extraction  @xcite from the model obtained by the fit to @xmath5 scattering data ( jlms )  @xcite .    while only one pole in the similar energy region was reported in some other analyses .",
    "we examine the stability of this two - pole structure against the following variation , keeping a good reproduction of said single - energy ( said - ses ) solution  @xcite unless otherwise stated :    * large variation of the parameters of the meson - exchange mechanisms as well as bare @xmath2 parameters of the ebac - dcc model . *",
    "inclusion of a bare nucleon state : the analytic structure of this model is rather different from the original ebac - dcc model , in particular in the region near the nucleon pole  @xcite , . * fit to the solution based on the carnegie - mellon university - berkeley model ( cmb )  @xcite which has rather different behavior from said - ses for higher @xmath6 .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe dynamical coupled - channels model used in this work , followed by a brief explanation for the analytic continuation used to extract poles from the model .",
    "the ebac - dcc model contains @xmath1 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 channels and the @xmath8 channel has @xmath4 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 components .",
    "these meson - baryon ( mb ) channels are connected with each other by meson - baryon interactions ( @xmath11 ) , or excited to bare @xmath2 states by vertex interactions ( @xmath12 ) . with these interactions",

    "the self energy @xmath32 is calculated from a vertex function defining the decay of the considered unstable particle in the presence of a spectator @xmath33 or @xmath34 with momentum @xmath35 .",
    "for example , we have for the @xmath4 state , @xmath36^{1/2 } } \\frac{\\left|f_{\\delta \\to \\pi n}(q)\\right|^2 } { e - e_\\pi(k ) -[m^2_{\\pi n}(q ) + k^2]^{1/2 } + i\\epsilon } , \\label{eq : self - pid}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 defines the decay of the @xmath39 in the rest frame of @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the corresponding integration contour in the complex-@xmath17 plane .      to examine further the model dependence of resonance extractions ,",
