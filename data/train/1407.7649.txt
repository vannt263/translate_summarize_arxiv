    "a five - year international design study called future circular collider ( fcc ) has been launched by cern in february 2014  @xcite .",
    "the main goal is a hadron collider with a centre - of - mass energy @xmath0 of the order of 100  tev for pp collisions in a new 80100  km tunnel in the geneva area .",
    "the target start of operation would be 203540 .",
    "operating such machine with heavy ions is an option that is being considered in the accelerator design studies .    for a centre - of - mass energy @xmath1  tev for pp collisions ,",
    "the relation @xmath2 gives the energy in centre - of - mass per nucleon ",
    "nucleon collision of @xmath3  tev for pb  pb ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and 63  tev for p  pb collisions . the rapidities of the proton and pb beams are 11.6 and 10.6 , respectively . a first conservative estimate of the integrated luminosity for pb ",
    "pb collisions is of about 5  nb@xmath6 per month of running  @xcite , that is about five times larger than the current projection for the future lhc runs  @xcite .    the increased centre - of - mass energy and luminosity with respect to the lhc open new opportunities . here ,",
    "we present first general considerations on the following topics :    * high - density qcd and quark  gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the final state of heavy - ion collisions ( section  [ sec : qgp ] ) ; * high - density qcd and gluon saturation in the initial state of heavy - ion collisions ( section  [ sec : saturation ] ) ; * photon - induced collisions and connections with cosmic - ray physics ( section  [ sec : others ] ) .",
    "more details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the qgp state produced in pb ",
    "pb collisions at @xmath7  tev is expected to have larger volume , lifetime , energy density and temperature than at the top lhc energy .",
    "these properties can be estimated by extrapolating the measurements of global event characteristics at lower energies namely : the charged particle multiplicity , the transverse energy and the parameters extracted from bose - einstein ( be ) correlations  @xcite . to this purpose",
    ", the following parametrizations were used : @xmath8 at @xmath9 @xmath10 ; total @xmath11 , with @xmath12 in gev ; @xmath13 at @xmath9 @xmath14 ; be homogeneity volume @xmath15 ; be decoupling time @xmath16 .",
    "the results are reported in table  [ tab : pbpb ] for central pb ",
    "pb collisions ( 05% ) .",
    "the charged - particle multiplicity is expected to increase by about a factor of two from top lhc to fcc energy .",
    "the volume and lifetime of the system are expected to increase by a factor of two and by 20% , respectively .",
    "these factors are confirmed by a full hydro - dynamical simulation with input parameters shear - viscosity - over - entropy - density ratio @xmath17 and initial temperature such that the final @xmath8 is 3600  @xcite .",
    "the space - time profile of the freeze - out volume is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : freezeout ] ( left ) .",
    "the length of the arrows represents the strength of the radial flow field : a substantial increase can be seen .",
    "the larger final volume and stronger flow field suggest that the collective effects would be enhanced .",
    "in addition , the two - fold larger multiplicity may open the possibility to carry out flow measurements on an event - by - event basis .",
    ".global properties measured in central pb ",
    "pb collisions at @xmath18  tev and extrapolated to 5.5 and 39  tev .",
    "note that the values measured at 2.76  tev are reported without experimental uncertainties and are intended for comparison only . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : pbpb ]    the bjorken expression @xmath19 estimates the time - dependent energy density of the system starting from the measured transverse energy .",
    "then , the stefan - boltzmann relation provides an estimate of the temperature evolution of the system : @xmath20^{1/4}$ ] , where @xmath21 is the number of degrees of freedom for a system with gluons and three quark flavours .",
    "the energy density increases by a factor of two from lhc to fcc , reaching for example a value of 35  gev/@xmath22 at 1  fm/@xmath23 .",
    "figure  [ fig : freezeout ] ( right ) shows the time - dependence of the estimated temperature for top lhc and for fcc energy .",
    "the increase , at given time , is modest , but the thermalization time of the system ( initial time of the qgp evolution ) can be expected to be smaller at fcc than at lhc , where it is usually taken as @xmath24  fm/@xmath23 .",
    "if the thermalization time is significantly lower than 0.1  fm/@xmath23 , the initial temperature could be as large as @xmath25  mev .",
    "an interesting consequence of the increase in the temperature of the system could be a sizeable production of secondary charm - anticharm ( @xmath26 ) pairs from partonic interactions during the hydrodynamical evolution of the system .",
    "calculations for top lhc energy indicate that this secondary production a ) can become of the same order of the initial production in hard scattering processes and b ) it is very sensitive to the initial temperature and temperature evolution of the qgp  @xcite . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : charm ] ( left ) shows the time evolution of the number of @xmath26 pairs per unit of rapidity at central rapidity ( the value at @xmath27 represents the production from hard scattering ) .",
    "the secondary charm production would yield an enhancement of charmed hadron production in the very - low-@xmath28 region , with respect to the expectation from binary scaling of the production in pp collisions .",
    "this enhancement potentially provides a handle on the temperature of the qgp .",
    "in addition , the abundance of charm quarks in the qgp is expected to have an effect on its equation of the state : lattice qcd calculations show a sizeable increase of @xmath29 ( which is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom ) when the charm quark is included and the system temperature is larger than about 400  mev  @xcite .",
    "the larger energy and luminosities will make new , rarer , hard probes available .",
    "figure  [ fig : charm ] ( right ) shows the energy dependence of a selection of hard cross sections computed at nlo accuracy with the mcfm code  @xcite , normalised to their value at 5.5  tev : the cross sections for top , z@xmath30+@xmath31 , bottom and z@xmath30 increase by factors 80 , 20 , 8 and 7 , respectively . in the following , we give an example of the very large statistics that could be obtained for currently unexplored observables , like top pair production . starting from the projections made by the cms collaboration for future lhc runs  @xcite",

    "proton  nucleus , nucleus  nucleus and electron  nucleus collisions at very high energy provide a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of high - density gluon densities in the initial nuclear state .",
    "the increase of the gluon density towards low virtuality @xmath35 and low momentum fraction @xmath36 is expected to be at some point tamed by a saturation effect ( see e.g.@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "when density becomes large , the dilute linear evolution of parton densities must break down and non - linear terms have to be considered .",
    "such non - linear terms describe merging processes of the type @xmath37 that balance the growth of the gluon density given by the splitting processes of the type @xmath38 .",
    "saturation effects become sizeable in processes with virtualities smaller than a few times the saturation scale @xmath39 , which is estimated to scale as @xmath40 ( @xmath41 is the mass number of the nucleus ) . the saturation scale can be increased ( thus making its effects more prominent ) by increasing @xmath0 , by using large nuclei instead of protons and by measuring at large rapidity @xmath42 .",
