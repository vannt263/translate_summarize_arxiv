    "this distance is slightly larger than the massive core s hill radius , which defines its gravitational sphere of influence as it orbits the host star .",
    "thus , unless the two planets have a rare orbital commensurability , the larger planet may drift inward , leaving the orbit of the remote planet free from subsequent interactions .",

    "we also ignore the possibility of additional accretion onto scattered planets as they interact with gas in the outer regions of the disk .",
    "if planets accrete @xcite , they will interact more strongly with the gas , enhancing the effects considered here .",
    "calculations suggest that growth from gas accretion may be important , even for planets as low as a few earth masses if they are located beyond 100  au @xcite .",
    "thus the orbital damping times in this work are overestimates .",

    "one concern is the parameterization of the drag force ( eq .  [ [ eq : acc ] ] ) , particularly in the transonic and subsonic regimes .",
    "fortunately , by the time a planet reaches subsonic speeds , it is already settled in the disk with a relatively low eccentricity , @xmath73 .",
    "the supersonic regime has more firm analytical basis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* although see lee & stahler 2014 ) that is consistent with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our implementation is conservative in its neglect of interactions between the planet and gas on scales less than the disk height ; at supersonic speeds , we might have included streamlines that crossed inside the planet s hill sphere .",
    "we also limit the initial orbits of scattered planets to lie in the disk midplane where planet - disk interactions are strongest .",
    "when a planet has a significant orbital inclination @xmath74 , it spends only a fraction of its orbit embedded in gas .",
    "the orbital evolution is then similar to a system where a planet with small @xmath75 orbits within a disk with a lower gas surface density , with details that depend on the planet s orbital elements .",
    "drawing from experience with dynamics in saturn s rings @xcite , we speculate that when a planet starts out with some inclination , it will settle vertically into the disk plane on a time scale similar to the circularization time .    in our calculations , we assume that the formation time for planets is short compared to the evolutionary time scale of the disk . thus , fully - formed planets scatter at @xmath76 , when the disk has its initial surface density ( eq .  [ [ eq : disk ] ] ) .",
    "although core formation can be fast , well within @xmath01  myr @xcite , the surface density of the disk probably evolves as planets form ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this aspect of our approach tends to overestimate the disk mass available to circularize the planet and underestimate the damping time . for the",
    "@xmath77 24  myr disk evolution times adopted here , the impact of this assumption is reasonably small .",
    "to assess the effect of the disk on a scattered planet we set up a suite of simulations with a variety of disk parameters and planetary orbits around a 1  @xmath2 star .",

    "the models have initial disk mass that ranges from 0.06  @xmath2 to 0.25  @xmath2 .",
    "these values are large compared to those of disks around t tauri stars @xcite but more in line with disks around protostars @xcite .",
    "this trend with stellar age is consistent with the assumption that planets form rapidly ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . still , the most massive disk is probably somewhat unrealistic in terms of surface density and total mass .",
    "however , since the key physical quantity for planet - disk interaction is the local density , the models labeled here according to surface density can represent disks with lower ( higher ) total mass if they have proportionally lower ( higher ) scale heights .    in our models ,",

    "the more massive planets experience significant circularization within a few million years ; less massive planets remain on eccentric orbits with @xmath93 .",

    "furthermore , when elements are sampled as a planet makes radial excursions through the disk , the values of @xmath9 , @xmath87 , and @xmath94 can vary , even over a single orbital period .",
    "the result is a modest amount of jitter . because our goal is to follow trends in elements , this choice for estimating orbital parameters has no impact on our conclusions .    to test the dependence of orbital evolution on disk structure , we consider the evolution of a planet with @xmath95  @xmath14 in a disk with gas density parameter @xmath39 = 0.25 , 0.5 and 1 ( figure [ fig : orbx ] ) .",

    "thus , the eccentricity evolution in a short - lived disk is limited .    in disks with an expanding inner cavity , there are two competing effects . at small @xmath9 ,",
    "the increasingly large inner disk radius limits damping and delays circularization compared to disks with a fixed inner radius . at large @xmath9 , the relatively static density profile enables additional damping compared to the exponential decay models .",
    "combined , these two features of the evolution conspire to produce circular orbits at larger @xmath9 than in the exponential decay models .    when the size of the inner cavity expands rapidly , the inner edge of the disk often passes by the planet .",

    "making other choices for @xmath42 and @xmath45 leads to qualitatively similar results .",
    "when @xmath101 , circularization occurs earlier and at smaller orbital distance .",
    "this effect is strongest in exponentially decaying disks and for the most massive planets .",
    "for example , in an exponentially decaying disk ( @xmath102 , @xmath103  myr ) with the inner edge moved to @xmath42 = 5  au , a 30  @xmath14 planet with an initial apoastron distance of 200  au ( @xmath104  au , @xmath105 ) ends up on a circular orbit at @xmath106  au , compared to 40  au in our baseline case with the more distant inner disk edge .    extending the outer edge of the disk past the initial apoastron distance has the opposite effect . in our baseline simulations",
