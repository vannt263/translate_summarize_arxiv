    "numerical integration is very often the only available tool for investigating the properties of nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "different numerical techniques @xcite have been developed over the years which permit the fast and accurate time evolution of orbits in such systems .    of particular interest",
    "are the so - called _ ` symplectic integrators ' _ which are numerical methods specifically aimed at advancing in time the solution of hamiltonian systems with the aid of symplectic maps ( see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapt .",
    "vi ) , @xcite and references therein ) . another challenging numerical task in conservative hamiltonian systems is to discriminate between order and chaos .",
    "this distinction is a delicate issue because regular and chaotic orbits are distributed throughout phase space in very complicated ways . in order to address the problem several methods",
    "have been developed , which can be divided into two major categories : the ones based on the study of the evolution of deviation vectors from a given orbit , like the computation of the maximal lyapunov characteristic exponent ( mlce ) @xmath2 @xcite , and those relying on the analysis of the particular orbit itself , like the frequency map analysis of laskar @xcite .",
    "other chaos detection methods , belonging to the same category with the evaluation of the mlce , are the fast lyapunov indicator ( fli ) @xcite and its variants @xcite , the smaller alignment index ( sali ) @xcite and its generalization , the so - called generalized alignment index ( gali ) @xcite , and the mean exponential growth of nearby orbits ( megno ) @xcite . the computation of these indicators require the numerical integration of the so - called _ variational equations _ , which govern the time evolution of deviation vectors .",
    "the scope of this paper is to present , analyze and compare different numerical methods for the integration of the variational equations . in our study",
    "we consider methods based on symplectic and non - symplectic integration techniques .",
    "the integration of the variational equations by non - symplectic methods is straightforward since one simply has to integrate these equations simultaneously with the equations of motion .",
    "this approach requires in general , more cpu time than schemes based on symplectic integration techniques for the same order of accuracy and integration time step . for this reason",
    "we _ focus our attention on methods based on symplectic schemes _ , explaining in detail their theoretical foundation and applying them to hamiltonian systems of different numbers of degrees of freedom .",
    "the numerical solution of the variational equations obtained by the various integration schemes studied are used for the computation of the spectrum of the lyapunov characteristic exponent ( lces ) and the galis .",
    "we chose to compute these two chaos indicators among the indices based on the evolution of deviation vectors , because the computation of the mlce is the elder and most commonly employed chaos detection technique , while the computation of the whole spectrum of lces and galis requires the evolution of more than one deviation vector and thus is strongly influenced by inaccuracies of the integration procedure .",
    "we investigate the numerical efficiency of the different integration methods by comparing the cpu times they require for the computation of the lces and the galis , as well as their accuracy in reproducing well - known properties of these chaos indicators .",
    "in particular , we check whether the set of computed lces consists of pairs of values having opposite signs , and if the time evolution of galis follows specific theoretically predicted laws .    the paper is organized as follows : after introducing the concept of variational equations in the next section , we describe in sections [ sec : lces ] and [ sec : gali ] the lces and the galis respectively , which are the two chaos indicators we use in our study .",
    "then , in section [ sec : si ] we give the basic properties of symplectic integrators .",
    "section [ sec : num_int ] is devoted to the detailed description of several numerical schemes for the integration of the variational equations of hamiltonian systems .",
    "applications of these schemes to regular and chaotic orbits of systems with two or more degrees of freedom are presented in section [ sec : numerics ] , where also the efficiency of each technique is discussed .",

    "a detailed review of the theory of the lces , as well as of the numerical techniques developed for their computation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the theory of lces was applied to characterize chaotic orbits by oseledec @xcite , while the connection between lces and exponential divergence of nearby orbits was given in @xcite . for a chaotic orbit",
    "at least one lce is positive , implying exponential divergence of nearby orbits , while in the case of regular orbits all lces are zero or negative .",
    "therefore , the computation of the mlce @xmath2 is sufficient for determining the nature of an orbit , because @xmath40 guarantees that the orbit is chaotic .",

    "in @xcite a theorem was formulated , which led directly to the development of a numerical technique for the computation of all lces , based on the time evolution of many deviation vectors , kept linearly independent through a gram - schmidt orthonormalization procedure .",
    "the theoretical framework , as well as the corresponding numerical method for the computation of all lces ( usually called the _ ` standard method ' _ ) , were given in @xcite . according to this method all other lces @xmath52 , @xmath53 etc .",

    "we note that throughout the present paper , whenever we need to compute the values of the lces , we apply the discrete qr - decomposition technique ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.10 ) , which is a variation of the standard method ( see sect .  6.3 of @xcite for more details ) .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that in the case of an autonomous hamiltonian flow , the set of lces consists of pairs of values having opposite signs @xmath57 in addition , since the hamiltonian function is an integral of motion , at least two lces vanish , i.  e. @xmath58 while the presence of any additional independent integral of motion leads to the vanishing of another pair of lces .",
    "the gali is an efficient chaos detection technique introduced in @xcite as a generalization of a similar indicator called the smaller alignment index ( sali ) @xcite .",
    "the method has been applied successfully for the discrimination between regular and chaotic motion , as well as for the detection of regular motion on low dimensional tori to different dynamical systems @xcite .",

    "expanding the wedge product ( [ eq : gali ] ) into a sum of determinants and studying the asymptotic behavior of those who vary the _ slowest _ in time , it is possible to show analytically the following @xcite : in the case of a chaotic orbit all deviation vectors tend to become linearly dependent , aligning in the direction defined by the mlce and @xmath60 tends to zero exponentially following the law @xmath67 t } , \\label{eq : gali_chaos}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 are approximations of the first @xmath59 largest lyapunov exponents . on the other hand , in the case of regular motion on an @xmath3-dimensional torus ,",

    "the families of sbab ( and saba ) symplectic integrators , which involve only forward ( positive ) integration steps were introduced .",

    "the use of any symplectic scheme for the integration of the equations of motion ( [ eq : eq_mot_v ] ) of the @xmath3d hamiltonian ( [ eq : hh_usual ] ) corresponds to the repeated action of a @xmath8-dimensional symplectic map @xmath0 , constructed by the appropriate composition of maps @xmath132 ( [ eq : h_la ] ) , @xmath108 ( [ eq : h_lb ] ) ( and @xmath264 ( [ eq : h_lc ] ) if the corrector term @xmath143 is used ) .",
