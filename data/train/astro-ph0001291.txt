    "the stellar structure of the galaxy has been studied by many groups using a variety of methods , such as metallicity - age determinations or studies of the kinematics of nearby halo and disk stars ( for a review see norris 1998 ) .",
    "other discussions can be found in fuchs & jahrei ( 1998 ) , or fuhrmann ( 1998 ) .",
    "the method predominantly used to study galactic strucure is the method of _ starcounts_.",
    "this provides a measurement of the density distribution of the stellar component of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "+ in the so called _ standard model _ ( bahcall & soneira 1980 ) the vertical structure of the disk follows an exponential law ( @xmath10 ) with scaleheight @xmath11 . as gilmore & reid ( 1983 ) showed , the data can be fitted much better by a superposition of two exponentials . whether or not this deviation from the single",
    "exponential is due to a distinct population of stars is not clear , although this is suggested by the different kinematics and lower metallicities @xcite .",
    "we will call the deviation  thick disk  , regardless of its unknown physical origin .",
    "+ although the existence of the `` thick disk '' component seems well established now @xcite , the proper values for the scaleheights and lengths are not exactly determined yet , since in most studies the distance of observable stars has been limited to a few kpc above the galactic plane . + another topic of debate has been whether the stellar luminosity function ( hereafter slf ) of main sequence stars in the disk declines beyond @xmath12 .",
    "most photometric studies find a down - turn of the slope of the slf at @xmath12 @xcite , whereas local observations of stars in the solar neighbourhood indicate a flat continuation to fainter magnitudes @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to derive the slf from the cadis starcounts .",
    "+ the paper is structured as follows : the * c*alar * a*lto * d*eep * i*maging * s*urvey  is outlined in sect .",

    "5 with the slf and its implications for the mass function . sect .",
    "6 gives a brief summary and an outlook on future prospects .",
    "the * c*alar * a*lto * d*eep * i*maging * s*urvey   combines an emission line survey carried out with an imaging fabry - perot interferometer with a deep multicolour survey using three broad - band optical to nir filters and up to eighteen medium - band filters when fully completed .",
    "the combination of different observing strategies facilitates not only the detection of emission line objects but also to derive photometric spectra of all objects in the fields without performing time consuming slit spectroscopy .",
    "details of the survey and its calibration will be given in meisenheimer et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "+ all observations were performed on calar alto , spain , in the optical wavelength region with the focal reducers cafos ( calar alto faint object spectrograph ) at the 2.2 m telescope and mosca ( multi object spectrograph for calar alto ) at the 3.5 m telescope , and with the omega prime camera for the nir observations .",
    "+ as a byproduct of the survey we obtain a lot of multi - color data about faint stars in the galaxy .",
    "although for the object classification ( see below ) exposures in two broadband filters and seven medium - band filters ( in the case of the 9h field eight medium - band filters ) are used , the present analysis of the stellar component of cadis is based only on exposures in three filters , @xmath13 ( central wavelength / width @xmath14 nm ) , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 nm ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 nm ) .",

    "a second selection criterium for the fields was that there should be no star brighter than @xmath24 in the cadis @xmath25 band .",
    "in fact the brightest star in the two fields under consideration has an @xmath25 magnitude of @xmath26 .",
    "+      objects are identified on each of the deep images ( superposition of 5 to 15 individual exposures ) using the source extractor software * se*xtractor @xcite , and the resulting lists merged into a master catalogue .",
    "+ photometry is done using the program _ evaluate _ , which has been developed by meisenheimer & rser ( 1986 ) .",
    "variations in seeing in between individual exposures are taken into account , in order to get accurate colors .",
    "for photometric calibration we use a system of  tertiary  standard stars in the cadis fields , which are calibrated with secondary standard stars @xcite in photometric nights . + from the locus of the stars in the 8-dimensional color space we conclude that the relative calibration between each pair of wavebands is better than 3 % for all objects with @xmath27 . + since one of the major goals of the survey is the classification of every object found in all cadis fields ( @xmath28 to @xmath29 in total ) , a classification scheme was developed which is based on template spectral energy distributions ( see wolf 1998 ) . the observed colors of every object are compared with a color library of known objects , whose colors are obtained from synthetic photometry performed on our cadis filterset .",
    "the input library for stellar spectra was the gunn & stryker ( 1983 ) catalogue . for each object the probability to belong to a certain object class ( stars  quasars  galaxies ) is computed .",
    "+ objects classified as stars have stellar colors with a likelihood of more than 75% , and images the profile of which does not deviate significantely from that of well defined stars .",

    "1999 , and wolf ( in preparation ) .",
    "+ with the current filter set and exposure times the classification is reliable down to a limit of @xmath30 .",
    "this was checked by spectroscopic follow - up observations of 245 arbitrarily chosen objects ( 55 stars , 153 galaxies and 20 quasars ) with @xmath31 .",
    "one galaxy has been classified as a star by it s colors , two quasars as galaxies and two galaxies as quasars .",
    "the star counts are not significantly affected by the misclassifications down to @xmath32 .",
    "thus we restrict our present analysis to stars with @xmath33 .",
    "to derive distances of the stars from the distance modulus @xmath34 , it is essential to know the absolute magnitudes of the stars , @xmath35 . + in principle",
    "absolute magnitudes of main sequence stars can be obtained from a color - magnitude diagramm .",
    "this main sequence approximation is valid for all stars in our sample since we can be sure that it is free from contamination of any non - main sequence stars , as the faint magnitude intervall we observe ( @xmath36 ) does not allow the detection of a giant star .",
    "+ we took a mean @xmath37 versus @xmath38 relation from lang ( 1992 ) .",
    "a complication arises , because there is no @xmath39 filter included in our filter set .",
    "thus we have to convert @xmath9 and @xmath38 into our filter system , in order to derive the absolute magnitudes from mean main sequence fit in @xmath35 versus @xmath40 , where the cadis color is defined by : @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the flux outside the atmosphere in units of photons @xmath43 in the cadis filter @xmath44 . + in order to convert @xmath40 into the johnson @xmath38 we performed synthetic photometry on the gunn - stryker stars ( wolf , priv . comm . ) .",
    "+ @xmath45 can be calibrated to the johnson - cousins system ( the cadis @xmath13 is very close to the cousins @xmath25 ) by using vega as a zero point : @xmath46 the absolute magnitude @xmath47 is then given by @xmath48 where we assume @xmath49 ( see huang et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "+ with the above conversions , the main sequence ( @xmath35 vs @xmath40 ) can be approximated by a fourth order polynomial in the range @xmath50 : @xmath51 the parameters of which are : +    @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56  , +    as shown in fig .",
    "+    one further complication arises due to the fact that the mean main sequence relation is valid strictly only for stars with solar metallicities , whereas our sample may contain stars spread over a wide range of different metalicities . for the blue stars ( @xmath57 ) , which are almost all halo stars ( see fig . [ codistr ] ) , and",
    "therefore supposed to be metal - poor , we use the same main sequence relation , but shifted towards fainter magnitudes by @xmath58 ( see fig . [ mseq ] ) .",
    "this value is the mean deviation from the mean main sequence defined by the cns 4 stars @xcite of a subsample of 10 halo stars , for which absolute r magnitudes were available ( jahrei , priv . com.).kpc but @xmath57 ) , but should be correct on average . ]",
    "+ the spread in a two color diagram @xmath40 versus @xmath59 ( that is the cadis color between @xmath13 and @xmath17 analog to eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) becomes significant at @xmath60 , see fig .",
    "[ metall ] .",
    "the maximal photometric error for the very faint stars is @xmath61 .",
    "here metallicity effects will distort the relation between the measured @xmath40 colors and the spectral type ( temperature ) and thus lead to wrong absolute magnitudes , so we have to correct for metallicity in order to avoid errors in the photometric parallaxes .",
    "+    the @xmath13 filter is strongly affected by metallicity effects like absorption bands of tio@xmath62 and vo molecules in the stars atmosphere , whereas the @xmath15 and the medium - band filter @xmath17 ( the wavelength of which was chosen in order to avoid absorption bands in cool stars ) are not .",
    "so in a first approximation we can assume the  isophotes  of varying metallicity in a @xmath40 versus @xmath59 two color diagram to be straight lines with a slope of @xmath63 , along of which we project the measured colors with @xmath64 onto the mean main sequence track which in the interval @xmath65 is defined by @xmath66 this projection implies that stars with @xmath67 can not exist in fig .",

    "both the upper and lower magnitude limits lead to selection effects which have to be taken into account . + as one can see in fig .",
    "[ wichtig ] there is an bimodality of the observed color distribution .",
    "the accumulation of red stars in the upper left consists mainly of disk stars , and is separated by a void from the blue stars , which predominantly belong to the halo .",
    "thus a crude disk - halo separation can be drawn by a color cut  we take stars with @xmath69 to be halo , stars with @xmath70 to be disk stars . in the following we will make use of this color cut to derive the distribution of the disk stars separately . in a second step , the distribution as a whole will be analysed . in fig .",
    "[ wichtig ] the cut is denoted by a dotted horizontal line .",
    "+ in the two fields we have analysed so far we find 95 halo and 178 disk stars , that is a factor of two more disk stars than predicted by the standard model @xcite .",
    "this surplus of disk stars was already noted by reid & majewski ( 1993 ) .",
    "[ codistr ] shows the distribution of the @xmath68 in the two fields under consideration .",
    "as expected , the detection limit of absolute magnitudes ( colors ) is distance dependent ( see fig . [ wichtig ] ) .",
    "+ we use the two - dimensional distribution of stars in the @xmath68 vs @xmath71 diagram ( fig .",
    "[ wichtig ] ) to correct for this incompleteness in the following way : first , we divide the distance in logarithmic bins of 0.2 as indicated in fig .",
    "[ wichtig ] and count the stars up to the the upper color limit @xmath72 ( this is the distance dependent color ( luminosity ) limit , up to which stars can be detected .",
    "the metal - poor halo stars are intrinsically fainter ( see paragraph 3 ) ) , thus the limits are shifted accordingly ) .",
    "+ the nearest bins ( @xmath73 ) are assumed to be complete . for the incomplete bins we multiply iteratively with a factor given by the ratio of complete to incomplete number counts in the previous bin , where the limit for the uncorrected counts is defined by the bin currently under examination ( @xmath74 ) : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the number of stars in bin @xmath74 , @xmath77 is the number of stars in the previous bin ( @xmath78 ) , up to the limit given by the bin @xmath74 , and @xmath79 is the number of stars from that limit up to the limit given by bin @xmath78 , see also appendix .",

    "+      we first study the density distribution of the disk stars by taking only stars in the corresponding color interval into account .",
    "although the color - cut at @xmath89 is a rather crude separation between disk and halo , we gain a clearer insight into the disk distribution since the contamination by halo stars is suppressed considerably .",
    "+ as the nearest stars in our fields have still distances of about 200pc the normalization at @xmath90 has to be established by other means : we take stars from the cns4 @xcite , which are located in a sphere with radius 20pc around the sun . +",
