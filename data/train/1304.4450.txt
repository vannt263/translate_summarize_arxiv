    "kolmogorov - sinai entropy of a @xmath3-preserving map @xmath4 on a probability space @xmath5 is an important concept in dynamical systems and ergodic theory .",
    "it is defined as the supremum of the entropy rates @xmath6 of _ all _ finite partitions @xmath7 of @xmath8 , which usually makes its determination complicated . in some exceptional cases ,",
    "a generating partition is known allowing to determine the kolmogorov - sinai entropy on the base of only this partition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but generally one has to take into account an infinite collection of finite partitions .",
    "here the question arises whether such a collection is given in a natural way .",
    "an interesting approach leading to some kind of natural partitioning was given by introducing the concept of permutation entropy by c.  bandt and b.  pompe @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this quantity is based on only considering the order structure of a system and has been applied to the analysis of long time series , for example , of electroencephalograms and cardiograms .",
    "the point that kolmogorov - sinai entropy and permutation entropy coincide for piecewise monotone interval maps , as shown by c.  bandt , g.  keller and b.  pompe @xcite , gives rise to the question if both entropies are equivalent for a broader class of dynamical systems .",
    "j.  amig , m.  kennel , and l.  kocarev @xcite have shown equivalence of kolmogorov - sinai entropy to a modified concept of permutation entropy which is structurally similar to that of kolmogorov - sinai entropy .",
    "k.  keller and m.  sinn @xcite have discussed the question of coincidence of permutation entropy and kolmogorov - sinai entropy in a general context , in particular by considering dynamical systems equipped with a random vector @xmath9 here the idea is to measure complexity of a system via the ` observables ' @xmath10 . for given @xmath11 ,",
    "the set @xmath8 is partitioned into sets of points @xmath12 for which all vectors @xmath13 are of the same order type . the larger @xmath14 the more information on the system",
    "is given by the partition obtained in this way and called @xmath15 here .",
    "the permutation entropy is defined as the upper limit of the shannon entropy of the @xmath15 relative to @xmath14 for @xmath16 .",
    "it has been shown that under certain ` separation ' conditions on @xmath17 it holds @xmath18 and that the permutation entropy with respect to @xmath19 is not less than the kolmogorov - sinai entropy . under validity of",
    ", the problem of equality of both entropies is reduced to a combinatorial problem related to the problem of equality of permutation entropy and the right side of ( see k.  keller , a.  unakafov and v.  unakafova @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is of some particular interest to find sufficient conditions for being as general as possible .",
    "this is the central aim of the present paper .",
    "the main ingredient for showing is the equivalence of two @xmath0-algebras with respect to @xmath20 in the case of ergodic @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath0-algebra generated by @xmath24 . for making apparent the structural arguments ,",
    "consider the third @xmath0-algebra @xmath25 , generated by @xmath26 and their ` shifts ' @xmath27 .",
    "the central statement of this paper is that for ergodic @xmath21 @xmath28 since @xmath29 which can be verified by standard arguments , this provides that in the ergodic case @xmath30 is equivalent to , hence sufficient for .",
    "the second ingredient for showing is ergodic decomposition .",
    "condition is substantially weaker than the corresponding statement in @xcite , allowing generalizations of consequences of the main statement therein . in particular",
    ", the application of embedding theory ( compare @xcite and @xcite ) is more apparent from the viewpoint of our paper , but it also turns out that the full power of this theory is not needed . in this paper",
    "we will show that the set of smooth maps @xmath26 satisfying which are not too far from being injective is large in a certain sense .      in section [ s2 ]",
    "we give the basic definitions and formulate the main statements of the paper , which are theorems [ th : sigmax_f_hks_limpe ] and [ th : setx_residual ] .",
    "section [ s3 ] is mainly devoted to the proof of theorem [ th : sigmax_f_hks_limpe ] . here , the ideas given in @xcite are lifted to a sufficiently abstract level , in order to extract the general structures and to find the necessary assumptions under which is satisfied .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th : setx_residual ] is given in section [ s4 ] .",
    "as a preparation of the proof , we recall some definitions and statements from ( differential ) topology , as for example the multijets transversality theorem , and deduce some statement being interesting from their own right .",
