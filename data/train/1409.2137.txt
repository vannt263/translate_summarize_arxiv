    "during the past decade there has been a growing effort to demonstrate nano - to - mesoscale mechanical systems existing in manifest quantum states  @xcite .",
    "one motivation is to understand how classical dynamics arises from quantum dynamics for systems with center of mass much larger than that of a single atom , and in particular establish whether the quantum - to - classical transition is solely a consequence of environmentally induced decoherence  @xcite or perhaps ultimately due to some as yet undiscovered , fundamental ` collapse ' mechanism  @xcite .",
    "three important milestones have been the demonstration of a @xmath4 mechanical resonator mode in a single phonon fock state  @xcite , the demonstration of an entangled @xmath5 mechanical resonator mode  microwave cavity mode state  @xcite , and the demonstration of a @xmath6 mechanical resonator in a quadrature - squeezed state with minimum variance @xmath7 times that of the quantum ground state  @xcite .",
    "a particularly straightforward mechanical geometry is that of a long , thin suspended beam ( wire ) that is supported at both ends ( i.e. , doubly clamped ) . the wire can be driven transversely , exciting its fundamental flexural mode resonance , using several available actuation methods .",
    "for the example of a crystalline silicon ( si ) wire that is a few micrometers long and a fraction of a micrometer in cross section , the mechanical fundamental flexural frequency is @xmath8  @xcite . consider an si atom or other atom type attached to the surface midway along the length of such a vibrating wire .",
    "suppose that the midpoint displacement amplitude is @xmath9 .",
    "then assuming that the midpoint undergoes simple harmonic motion , @xmath10 , we have for the maximum acceleration experienced by the attached atom @xmath11 .",
    "this is an unexpectedly large acceleration , @xmath12 times larger than the gravitational acceleration @xmath13 on the surface of the earth and closer in magnitude to the surface gravity of a neutron star   @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze one possible application of these extreme accelerations in a mesoscopic setting ; there are undoubtedly other hitherto unexplored applications .",
    "in particular , we shall consider a model two - path atom interferometer shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "the right path consists of a vibrating wire , atom guide segment with micrometer dimensions similar to those described above .",
    "the left path is fixed , without a vibrating wire segment .",
    "incident atom wave packets split into left and right wave packet components .",
    "the right wave component will accumulate a phase shift relative to the left wave component as a consequence of the vibrating wire functioning effectively as a non - inertial reference frame for the traversing right wave .",
    "the right wave component eventually exits the non - inertial frame and recombines with the left wave component . as we shall see below in sec .",
    "[ sec : classical ] , this results in an in principle detectable fringe visibility for the left - right wave component interference as the vibrating wire amplitude is varied in the nanometer range",
    ".    quantum wave interference due to gravitational and inertial forces has been experimentally demonstrated for neutrons  @xcite , atoms  @xcite , cooper - pairs  @xcite , and electrons  @xcite , verifying the equivalence between these forces for quantum matter systems  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a recent comprehensive analysis takes into account also the possibility of atoms in each path of an interferometer experiencing different inertial forces , similar to our vibrating wire , interferometer model  @xcite .",
    "however , in all of these experiments and analyses the non - inertial reference frames ( and of course gravity ) were treated as classical systems and there was no reason to view them otherwise . on the other hand , with mesoscopic mechanical resonators now being prepared and measured in manifest quantum states  @xcite as described above , it is very natural to consider the consequences for the matter wave interference of the vibrating wire functioning effectively as a quantum non - inertial reference frame  @xcite .",
    "we shall therefore consider in sec .",

    "sec : realization ] outlines a possible way to realize a non - inertial , vibrating wire - atom interferometer using a superfluid helium quantum interference setup .",
    "beginning first with a classical description , we approximate the non - inertial frame as a long , thin beam ( wire ) of length @xmath14 with hinged boundary conditions , so that for small amplitude transverse displacements ( @xmath15 ) the frame coordinates in the lowest , fundamental flexural mode are @xmath16 , @xmath17 . we suppose that atoms traversing the frame in the longitudinal , @xmath18 coordinate direction are described by localized wave packets propagating with uniform group velocity @xmath19 relative to the vibrating frame , where @xmath20 is the atom dwell time in the frame .",
    "the atoms are assumed to be confined by a harmonic potential to the frame in their transverse , @xmath21 coordinate direction that is aligned with the frame flexing @xmath22 coordinate direction .",
    "the bound atom potential is then @xmath23 ^ 2 $ ] , where both atom and frame coordinates ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively ) are defined relative to a common origin in the assumed inertial lab frame .",
    "the various characteristic frequencies are assumed to satisfy @xmath24 , so that the atom spends many oscillation cycles in the frame , while it is tightly bound with negligible transverse motion relative to the frame .",
    "this assumption is not fundamental but rather for calculational convenience . in particular , assuming instead @xmath25 requires a more involved analysis of the interference between the left and right waves , but can still result in significant accumulated phase differences .",
    "micrometer scale resonators have masses @xmath26 , while the atom mass @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to neglect the back action of the atom on the classical frame .",
    "we assume that the frame is initially excited in its fundamental transverse flexural mode and freely oscillates with negligible change in amplitude ( i.e. , damping ) over the atom dwell time @xmath20 . in terms of the transverse atom @xmath21 and frame",
    "@xmath22 coordinates , the schrdinger equation for the atom in the vibrating frame described by the right path wave component @xmath29 is then @xmath30 ^ 2\\psi_r .",
    "\\label{sch1eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation may be straightforwardly solved assuming a gaussian function form . with the atom entering the frame initially in its transverse ground state : @xmath31 , the resulting interference between the left and right path wave components at @xmath32 is @xmath33 where the accumulated phase difference between the left and right waves is @xmath34 note that the only atom attributes that the phase difference  ( [ phase1eq ] ) depends on are its inertial mass @xmath35 and traversal velocity @xmath36 relative to the vibrating frame ; @xmath37 does not appear to leading order as a consequence of the atom assumed to be tightly bound transversely to the frame , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "putting in some numbers : with @xmath27 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 .",
    "thus , significant phase shifts result for dwell times in excess of a microsecond .",
    "interestingly , this estimated phase shift following from eq .",
    "( [ phase1eq ] ) is of the same order of magnitude as the measured gravitational phase difference between two interfering neutron beam paths in ref .",
    "@xcite , despite the fact that the vibrating wire acceleration magnitude @xmath42 is eight orders of magnitude larger than @xmath43 . to understand this ,",
    "consider the gravitational phase difference expression  @xcite : @xmath44 , where @xmath35 is the neutron mass , @xmath45 is the component of gravity in the plane of the neutron paths , @xmath46 is the area enclosed by the two paths , and @xmath36 is the neutron velocity . in contrast to this expression , eq .",
    "( [ phase1eq ] ) does not scale with the area enclosed by the two paths .",
    "this is because the transverse inertial force experienced by the atom is different in the two paths , in particular much larger in the right path containing the vibrating wire , whereas the gravitational field is uniform across the neutron interferometer .",
    "comparing eq .",
    "( [ phase1eq ] ) with the gravitational phase difference expression , the reason for the similar phase shift magnitudes is that the effective area to atom velocity ratio term @xmath47 is about eight orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding ratio @xmath48 for the neutron interferometer .",
    "however , in contrast to the much larger @xmath49 scale neutron interferometer where the acceleration due to gravity is of course well described classically , the micrometer scale , non - inertial vibrating wire frame can also in principle be prepared in a manifest quantum state .    a possibly more fundamental way to understand the phase difference  ( [ phase1eq ] ) follows from the original observation of de broglie  @xcite that the phase of a particle s wave function can be directly expressed in terms of the proper time along the path of the particle . in particular",
    ", we have  @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath52 is the proper time elapsed for the atom traveling along the left ( right ) interferometer path . since the frame velocity @xmath53 for the above considered parameters",
    ", we have @xmath54 and hence @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the left ( right ) path atom velocity relative the lab frame . substituting in the approximation @xmath57 , valid for the condition @xmath24 , eq .",
    "( [ phase2eq ] ) then gives the same result as eq .",
    "( [ phase1eq ] ) .",
    "thus , the phase difference  ( [ phase1eq ] ) can be viewed as a consequence of the  twin paradox \"  @xcite , where the right path wave packet bound to its noninertial , vibrating frame  ages \" less than the left path wave packet during the elapsed lab coordinate time interval @xmath20 .",

    "equation  ( [ phase3eq ] ) coincides with the classical frame accumulated phase difference  ( [ phase1eq ] ) , as we would expect for a coherent frame state .",
    "we now give two examples of manifest quantum frame states . as our first example , consider a frame initially in a fock state : @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",

    "( [ phase3eq ] ) simply by replacing the frame coherent state amplitude modulus squared @xmath81 with the frame fock state number @xmath82 .",

    "for the example of the squeezed frame state , the frame energy uncertainty is @xmath92 for @xmath93 , while for the thermal frame state , the frame energy uncertainty is @xmath94 for @xmath95 . substituting into the respective conditions ( [ condition1eq ] ) and ( [ condition2eq ] )",
    ", we obtain the following common condition on the atom dwell time for the loss of quantum interference : @xmath96 where we have neglected numerical factors .",
    "thus , loss of interference occurs when the atom dwell time in the vibrating wire frame exceeds a dephasing timescale given by the atom s energy uncertainty .",
    "we may speculate that eq .",

    "while a quantum frame state with a sufficiently large energy uncertainty can lead to a suppression of atom interference , so too can a mixed , classical frame state , as we have just seen for the squeezed vacuum and thermal state examples ; it is not possible to qualitatively distinguish between quantum and classical frame states simply by measuring the atom wave interference for the two - path interferometer model that we are considering .",

    "<S> an atom attached to a micrometer - scale wire that is vibrating at a frequency @xmath0 and with displacement amplitude  @xmath1 experiences an acceleration magnitude @xmath2 , approaching the surface gravity of a neutron star . as one application of such extreme non - inertial forces in a mesoscopic setting , we consider a model two - path atom interferometer with one path consisting of the @xmath3 vibrating wire atom guide . </S>",
    "<S> the vibrating wire guide serves as a non - inertial reference frame and induces an in principle measurable phase shift in the wave function of an atom traversing the wire frame . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore consider the effect on the two - path atom wave interference when the vibrating wire is modeled as a quantum object , hence functioning as a quantum non - inertial reference frame . </S>",
    "<S> we outline a possible realization of the vibrating wire , atom interferometer using a superfluid helium quantum interference setup . </S>"
