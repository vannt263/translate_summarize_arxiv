    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are large - scale transient eruptions of magnetized plasma from the solar corona that propagate outward into interplanetary space .",

    "on the other hand , in an effort to understand the initiation mechanism of cmes , a number of numerical simulations have been carried out with different initial magnetic configurations and prescribed motions at the photosphere , i.e. , ( 1 ) a reconnection - favored emerging magnetic flux model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and strong shear flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) were reported in some of cme - productive active regions as possible mechanisms for cme initiation . however , the magnetic structure and the plasma flow in the cme - prodcuing active regions as well as the triggering mechanisms are still yet to be determined .",
    "it is believed that cmes occur in solar active regions with complex magnetic structures , whose complexity and non - potentiality can be measured by magnetic helicity quantitatively , in terms of twists , kinks and inter - linkages of the magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "magnetic helicity studies therefore have been carried out to understand magnetic field configurations and pre - eruption conditions in eruptive solar active regions .",
    "@xcite studied a filament in the active region noaa 8375 , and found a steady injection of magnetic helicity through the photosphere over a period of @xmath128 hours involving four eruptive events in the filament .",
    "it was also found that major flares were preceded by a large amount of photospheric helicity injection in their source active regions over a period of a few days ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , there were some observational reports that the injection of oppositely signed magnetic helicity into a pre - existing coronal field might be a crucial ingredient for triggering eruptions of active - region filaments , flares , and cmes : e.g. , @xcite investigated coronal magnetic helicity in the flare - cme - productive active region noaa 10930 , and found that there was not only a large increase of negative magnetic helicity of @xmath23.2@xmath310@xmath4mx@xmath5 in the active region corona over @xmath11.5 days prior to the x3.4 flare and its associated halo cme on 2006 december 13 but also a significant injection of positive magnetic helicity through the photosphere around the flaring magnetic polarity inversion line of the active region ( for other observational reports , refer also to * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    recently , by investigating photospheric magnetic helicity injection in 28 active regions producing 47 cmes",
    ", @xcite found that the 47 cmes under investigation can be categorized into two different groups by the evolution of helicity injection in their source active regions : ( 1 ) a monotonically increasing pattern with one sign of helicity ( group a ; 30 cmes ) and ( 2 ) a pattern of significant helicity injection followed by its sign reversal ( group b ; 17 cmes ) .",
    "in addition , it was found that there was a difference in cme speed , acceleration , and occurrence frequency between group a and group b. the main difference between these two cme groups in the temporal variation of helicity injection is that the helicity sign reversal phase appears in group b , but not in group a. in the study of @xcite , however , were not examined ( 1 ) where oppositely signed helicity is significantly injected during the sign reversal phase and ( 2 ) how its magnitude and distribution evolve with time . in this study , we therefore investigate carefully the spatial distribution and temporal variation of magnetic helicity flux density ( i.e. , magnetic helicity injection per unit area per unit time ) on the photosphere of the very eruptive active region noaa 9236 .",
    "this active region clearly showed the sign reversal phase and produced eight large cmes during the sign reversal phase .",
    "we expect that this study will develop a better understanding of a pre - cme magnetic structure and a trigger mechanism for cme initiation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : data selection and analysis for the calculation of magnetic helicity flux density in noaa 9236 are explained in section  [ sec2 ] . in section  [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we present the observational findings that : ( 1 ) all of eight cme - associated flares occurred in newly emerging magnetic flux regions in the vicinity of the main positive - polarity sunspot of noaa 9236 and ( 2 ) magnetic fields in the cme - associated flaring regions have favorable conditions for making reconnection with large - scale and overlying magnetic fields in the main sunspot regions of positive and negative magnetic polarities .",
    "finally , the results are summarized and discussed in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "the active region noaa 9236 appeared on the east limb of the solar disk on 2000 november 18 , and it was continuously observed during the time interval of its entire disk passage by the @xmath0 spacecraft . at an early stage of the development of noaa 9236 ( i.e. , 2000 november 1822 ) , a group of sunspots in the active region showed a general @xmath6 magnetic configuration of two main sunspots of positive ( preceding ) and negative ( following ) magnetic polarities with a simple and distinct division between the two polarities . from 2000",
    "november 23 , it then changed to a @xmath7 configuration : i.e. , a number of newly emerging small sunspot groups with complex polarities appeared around the main positive - polarity sunspot .",
    "there have been some studies on the properties of ( 1 ) flare - cme events that occurred in the active region noaa 9236 and ( 2 ) magnetic fields on the photosphere .",

    "they also found that soft and hard x - ray emissions from the flares were seen in and around the preceding positive - polarity sunspot .",
    "@xcite studied temporal variation of magnetic flux of small moving magnetic features ( mmfs ) in the vicinity of the main positive sunspot in noaa 9236 by tracking 452 mmfs from birth to death , and found that magnetic flux emergence and disappearance rates in the form of mmfs are 2.3@xmath310@xmath8mx@xmath9hr@xmath10 and 1.9@xmath310@xmath8mx@xmath9hr@xmath10 , respectively , during the period of 2000 november 2324 .",
    "@xcite analyzed multi - wavelength observational data of three x - class homologous flares in noaa 9236 that occurred on 2000 november 24 .",
    "as a result , they found a good correlation between the separation velocity of the two ribbons and the time derivative of the soft x - ray flux for each of the homologous flares , which can be explained by the magnetic energy release rate estimated from magnetic reconnection models for solar flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we now have the question of why cme - related flares occurred in e@xmath50 and e@xmath51 , but not in e@xmath52 and e@xmath49 . in the long - term ( a few days )",
    "variation of helicity injection , there seems to be no significant difference between the flaring and non - flaring regions because they in general show a similar trend in the time variation of @xmath35 , i.e. , a monotonically increasing trend with one sign of helicity during the entire investigation .",
    "furthermore , the magnitudes of @xmath32 , @xmath35 , and @xmath38 in the flaring regions are comparable to those in the non - flaring regions .",
    "however , comparison of the helicity in the bipolar magnetic fragments of e@xmath50 and e@xmath51 and the main sunspots suggests that the magnetic fields in e@xmath50 and e@xmath51 ( especially in the emerging bipoles outlined by the rectangular boxes in figure  [ sec3:fig3]b ) have substantially favorable conditions for making reconnection with those in r@xmath46 and r@xmath47 .",

    "the small - scale , under - lying , and inverse - s - shaped field lines ( red lines ) in the emerging bipoles of magnetic fragments in e@xmath50 and e@xmath51 may interact and reconnect with the large - scale , overlying , s - shaped , and oppositely directed field lines ( green lines ) in r@xmath46 and r@xmath47 .",
    "on the other hand , we speculate that the inferred field lines ( blue lines ) of an inverse - s and s shape in e@xmath52 and e@xmath49 , respectively , may pass underneath the field lines ( green lines ) in r@xmath46 and r@xmath47 so that it would be difficult to make a reconnection between the emerging and overlying fields .",
    "another noticeable difference is that the average increasing rate of the total unsigned magnetic flux @xmath55 in e@xmath51 during the entire time period is relatively larger than in the other regions : i.e. , 10.9@xmath310@xmath54mx@xmath9hr@xmath10 in the most eruptive region e@xmath51 where seven out of the eight flares occurred , but ( 1.8 , 1.1 , and 7.0)@xmath310@xmath54mx@xmath9hr@xmath10 in e@xmath52 , e@xmath50 , and e@xmath49 , respectively .",

    "we also found that the observational results during the eight flare - associated cmes events can be well explained by reconnection - favored emerging magnetic flux models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , in the two - dimensional cme model of @xcite , they set up a newly emerging magnetic flux system , of which magnetic fields oppositely directed to and may reconnect with those of a nearby large - scale magnetic flux system , and showed that the large - scale system could be totally destabilized and erupted due to a localized reconnection between the two systems . although the coronal magnetic field illustrated in figure  [ sec3:fig6 ] is much more complicated than that in the simple two - dimensional model , it is likely that some internal reconnections between large - scale overlying field lines ( r@xmath46 to r@xmath47 ) and small - scale emerging bipolar fields ( e@xmath50 and e@xmath51 ) may destabilize the magnetic system and give rise to cmes .",
    "in fact , @xcite recently found that the emergence of small - scale flux could trigger large - scale solar eruption even in three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems , if the emerging flux has the magnetic helicity with the sign opposite to the overlying field or the magnetic polarity of the emerging flux is oppositely directed to the large - scale field .",
    "the small - scale magnetic fluxes in regions e@xmath50 and e@xmath51 are well consistent with the former case .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed in their 3d numerical simulations of an emerging magnetic flux rope that the successful eruption of the flux rope results from the effective reconnection between the ambient field overlaying the rope and pre - existing coronal field : i.e. , the downward tension force of the ambient field above the flux rope is reduced via the reconnection so that the rope can erupt .",
    "we therefore conclude that reconnection - favored magnetic fields in the flaring emerging flux regions @xmath56 and @xmath57 play a crucial role in producing the multiple flare - associated cme events in the active region noaa 9236 . as a future work , more",
    "flare - associated cmes will be examined by using high spatial and temporal resolution data observed by the solar dynamics observatory ( @xmath58 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to better understand the long - term precondition and onset mechanism of reconnection - driven cmes .",
