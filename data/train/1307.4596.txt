    "magnetic fluids are colloidal suspensions of single domain ferromagnetic grains dispersed in a solvent @xcite . in order to keep such suspensions stable",
    "the grains have to be coated with polymers or surfactant layers or by using electric double layer formation in the case of water - based ferrofluids . accordingly",
    "the ferromagnetic particles typically come in different sizes , commonly ranging from 5 nm to 50 nm .",
    "each particle of a ferrofluid possesses a permanent magnetic dipole moment .",
    "therefore , in many cases ferrofluids can be described as dipolar liquids .",
    "actual ferrofluids are more or less polydisperse .",
    "this means that the particles may have different sizes and thus carry different magnetic moments which are proportional to their volume . a polydisperse fluid",
    "can be considered as a mixture consisting of a large number of components , with an essentially continuous distribution of the particle size .",
    "+ in dilute magnetic fluids the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction can be neglected as compared with the interaction between the particles and an external magnetic field .",
    "therefore , in an applied field the magnetization of these systems can be described by the langevin theory . at higher concentrations the effective interaction of disolved magnetic particles",
    "can be modeled in terms of dipolar hard spheres ( dhs ) .",
    "their interaction potential is the sum of the isotropic hard sphere ( hs ) and the anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction .    over the last few decades theoretical descriptions",
    "have evolved which allow one to study the initial susceptibility and the magnetization of mono- and polydisperse magnetic colloids .",
    "following weiss idea , pshenichnikov @xcite proposed the so - called modified mean - field model for calculating these quantities .",

    "ivanov and kuznetsova @xcite proposed a more sophisticated theory for these calculations . in order to assess the reliability of the aforementioned theoretical methods ivanov _ et al _ @xcite compared them with monte carlo ( mc ) and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation data as well as with experimental data .",
    "along these lines huke and lcke @xcite proposed a cluster expansion approach for monodisperse systems , which later was extended to polydisperse systems @xcite .",
    "starting from wertheim s @xcite analytical msa results , within the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) two of the present authors have also proposed @xcite an equation for the magnetization of _",
