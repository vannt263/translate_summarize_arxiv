    "telegraph processes with different switchings and velocity regimes are studied recently in connection with possibility of different applications such as , for instance , queuing theory ( see @xcite , @xcite ) and mathematical biology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "special attention is devoted to financial applications ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . in the latter case ,",
    "an arbitrage reasoning demands the presence of jumps .",
    "the motions with deterministic jumps are studied in detail , see the formal expressions of the transition densities in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "such a model is developed for the option pricing problem , which is based on the risk - neutral approach , see @xcite . if the jump amplitudes are random , the case is less known .",
    "the telegraph processes of this type are studied earlier only under the assumption of mutual independence of jump values and jump amplitudes , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similar setting were used for the purposes of financial applications , @xcite .",
    "we present here a jump - telegraph process when an amplitude of the next jump depends on the ( random ) time spent by the process at the previous state .",
    "this approach is of special interest for the economical and the financial applications , everywhere when the comportment of process relates with friction and memory .",
    "assume that the particle moves with random ( and _ variable _ ) velocities performing jumps of random amplitude whenever the velocity is changed .",
    "more precisely , the actual velocity regime and the amplitude of the next jump are defined as ( alternated ) functions of the time spent by the particle at the previous state .",
    "we assume also that the time intervals between the subsequent state changes have sufficiently arbitrary alternated distributions .",
    "it creates an effect of damping process where a friction is generated by means of memory .",
    "this setting generalises processes which were used before for market modelling by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the underlying processes are described in sections [ sec:2]-[sec:2 - 2 ] .",
    "section [ sec : mart ] presents the result which can be interpreted as a doob - meyer decomposition .",
    "several examples with different regimes of velocities and of jumps are presented .",

    "we define a pair of the ( generalised ) telegraph processes @xmath22 driven by variable velocities @xmath23 as follows , @xmath24 the integral @xmath25 is named the _ integrated telegraph process_.    let @xmath26 be a counting process .",

    "the integrated telegraph process can be interpreted as the sum of random number of random variables .",

    "finally , the generalised integrated jump - telegraph process is the sum of the integrated telegraph process defined by - and the jump component defined by : @xmath44 it describes the particle which moves , alternating the velocity regimes at random times @xmath13 , starting from the origin at the velocity regime @xmath45 .",

    "the distribution of @xmath49 is separated into the singular and absolutely continuous parts .",
    "the singular part of the distribution corresponds to the movement without any velocity reversals ; let @xmath50 be the respective conditional distribution , if the initial state @xmath51 is fixed : for any borel set @xmath52 we set @xmath53 we denote the corresponding expectation by @xmath54",
