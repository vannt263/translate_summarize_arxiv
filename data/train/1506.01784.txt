    "the idea of correspondence between gravity in an anti - de sitter spacetime and the conformal field theory living on its boundary ( ads / cft correspondence ) , was first suggested by maldacena in @xmath0 @xcite . according to maldacena s arguments the effects of the string or m - theory in a @xmath1-dimensional ads@xmath2 spacetime",
    "can be appeared in the form of a field theory on an @xmath3-dimensional @xmath4-constant brane which is the boundary of ads@xmath5 spacetime .",
    "he expressed that the finite temperature configurations in the field theory which lies on the @xmath3-dimensional brane and is decoupled from the bulk correspond to black hole configurations in ads@xmath5 spacetime @xcite .",
    "this proposal makes us able to study the non - perturbative aspects of the field theories .",
    "this idea attracted a lot of interests rapidly and has been studied from different points of view @xcite .",
    "since the line element of the ads spacetime,@xmath6is invariant under an isotropic conformal transformation @xmath7so the application of ads / cft is restricted to systems respected isotropic scale invariance .",
    "but , quantum critical systems show scaling symmetry    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is a dynamical critical exponent which shows the degrees of anisotropy between space and time . therefore , we can generalize ads spacetime to other spacetimes with anisotropic scale invariance @xmath10this spacetime was first introduced in @xcite and is called lifshitz spacetime .",
    "black hole configurations in the lifshitz spacetime are dual to the field theories enjoying anisotropic scale invariance on the boundary ( brane ) .",
    "it is well - known that lifshitz spacetime is not a vacuum solution of einstein gravity and it needs some matter sources . in many works this matter source",
    "was considered to be a massive gauge field mann , fixz2,fixz , nfixz .",
    "some of these solutions were obtained for fixed @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "for instance , the authors of @xcite focused on @xmath12 case .",
    "the main disadvantage of such models containing massive gauge fields is that it is usually impossible to obtain an analytic solution for an arbitrary @xmath11 , although some efforts have been made to do that @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that by considering a dilaton field , instead of a massive gauge field , we are able to derive exact solutions which helps us to get more insight . in addition ,",
    "string theory in its low energy limit recovers einstein gravity with a scalar dilaton field nonminimally coupled to gravity and other fields such as gauge fields dilaton . thermal behavior of uncharged lifshitz black branes in einstein - dilaton gravity has been investigated in @xcite .",

    "although electrodynamic lagrangian is conformally invariant in @xmath19 dimensions , this does not implies that the power should be fixed for general cases .",
    "we first consider a four dimensional toy model and fully describe the procedure of solving field equations and gaining desired solutions .",
    "then , we extend our solutions to the higher - dimensional spacetimes . from the prediction of string theory , we know that the spacetime may have more than four dimensions",
    ". therefore we get enough motivation for studying black hole solutions of einstein gravity in all higher dimensions .",
    "although it was thought for a while that the extra spacial dimensions are of the order of the planck scale , recent theories suggest that if we live on a three dimensional brane embedded in a higher dimensional bulk , it is quite possible to have the extra dimensions relatively large and still unobservable @xcite . in this scenario ,",

    "<S> in this paper , we construct a new class of analytic topological lifshitz black holes with constant curvature horizon in the presence of power - law maxwell field in four and higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in order to obtain these exact lifshitz solutions , we need a dilaton and at least three electromagnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly enough , we find that the reality of the charge of the electromagnetic field which is needed for having solutions with curved horizon rules out black holes with hyperbolic horizon . </S>",
    "<S> next , we study the thermodynamics of these nonlinear charged lifshitz black holes with spherical and flat horizons by calculating all the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the solutions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we obtain a generalized smarr formula and show that the first law of thermodynamics is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform a stability analysis in both canonical and grand - canonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the solutions are thermally stable in a proper ranges of the metric parameters . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we comment on the dynamical stability of the obtained solutions under perturbations in four dimensions . </S>"
