    "an ability to measure absolute thermodynamic temperature is currently confined to an exclusive list of national standards laboratories .",
    "such measurements require primary thermometry expertise and highly specialised equipment , making it impractical for wider - scale use . instead , for practical purposes , temperature scales such as its-90 @xcite , are used as an approximation to the true thermodynamic temperature , even though they are known to have relative uncertainties at the @xmath5 level @xcite .",
    "accordingly , there is now a global push to develop more convenient methods of primary thermometry that could make thermodynamic temperature measurements more broadly available @xcite .",
    "a second motivating factor driving recent renewed interest in primary thermometry is the call by the bureau des internationale de poids et measures to remeasure the boltzmann constant , @xmath1 , using a wide range of techniques in preparation for the redefinition of the kelvin in 2011 @xcite .    at present , the recommended value for @xmath1 is derived primarily from one acoustic measurement performed by moldover _ et .",
    ". it would be preferable if @xmath1 could be remeasured using different methods with comparable uncertainties so that any systematic errors can be identified .",
    "recently , bord suggested that the known@xcite temperature dependence of the spectral linewidth of absorption features , previously exploited for measurments of stellar atmospheric temperatures@xcite , can be used as a new technique for accurate primary thermometry@xcite .",
    "this doppler - broadening thermometry ( dbt ) method has since been experimentally realized and while currently less precise than other primary methods such as acoustic or dielectric constant gas thermometry , it suffers from very different types of systematic errors @xcite .",
    "in contrast to those techniques which measure the macroscopic quantity @xmath6 , the dbt method can directly probe the microscopic thermal energy @xmath7 by measuring the characteristic spectral width of molecular / atomic transitions , thereby avoiding the uncertainties in the avogadro constant @xmath8 .",

    "more recent work has improved the statistical uncertainty @xcite to @xmath9 . in this paper , we present results from an atomic rubidium ( rb ) dbt system at @xmath10 pa .",
    "the use of an alkali metal atom absorber presents some distinct spectroscopic differences that allow us to explore new experimental regimes within the dbt method . in doing so",
    ", we have identified some advantages in using an atomic system and encountered new challenges whose resolutions demand a deep understanding and detailed unification of light - matter interactions and gas dynamical theories @xcite . whilst this work has been motivated by primary thermometry",
    ", we believe that it has wider implications in all fields requiring high - resolution or precision , quantitative spectroscopy .",
    "the primary difference between a low - pressure atomic vapor system , like rb , and molecular experiments is that atomic motion is effusive , so collisions are extremely rare .",
    "an advantage of moving to this effusive regime is the avoidance of pressure - induced systematic changes , such as collisional line - shape perturbations @xcite .",
    "this removes the need to extrapolate results to an equivalent zero - pressure value .",
    "further , by using a sealed vapor - pressure reference gas cell , we avoid any unintended pressure drifts associated with a more sophisticated variable - pressure gas chamber . in this study",
    ", we chose rb which has a high optical cross section , ensuring that the absorption signal - to - noise is satisfactory in spite of the very low vapor density .",
    "this choice also gives the ability to operate in a range where high quality lasers are readily available and where silicon detectors , with their extremely good linearity @xcite and quantum efficiency , can be used . at room temperature , it was possible to use a smaller cell than those in the molecular experiments for the same absorption depth , which was convenient for thermal control .    on the other hand , there are also disadvantages to using atomic vapors .",
    "care is required to ensure low levels of residual magnetic fields which can lead to the broadening of spectral lines by lifting the degeneracy of zeeman levels . in the transition used in this experiment ( @xmath11 line of @xmath0rb ) , optical pumping between unresolved hyperfine transitions",
    "contributed the greatest potential for systematic error by perturbing the lineshape .",
    "in addition , the comparability of the natural lifetime , beam transit time and the rabi period in our situation leads to optical pumping effects that requires either an accurate model of the gas kinetics @xcite or the use of a low power probe beam to avoid lineshape perturbations .",
    "we followed the second route here and show here that the resulting perturbation is at the 4 parts - per - million ( ppm ) level .",
