    "the possible existence of the @xmath9 pentaquark remains one of the puzzling mysteries of recent years . to date",
    "there are more than 20 experiments with evidence for this state , but criticism for the @xmath9 claim arises because similar number of high energy experiments did not find any evidence for the @xmath9 , even though the other `` conventional '' three - quark hyperons such as @xmath1 hyperon resonance are seen clearly",
    ".    the situation is getting more intriguing , as recently clas collaboration reported negative results on @xmath9 photoproduction off proton and deuteron with high statistics .",
    "meanwhile leps collaboration reported the new evidence of the @xmath9 in @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "also , diana collaboration using increased statistics confirms its earlier result , and offers a new evidence for formation of a pentaquark baryon in the charge - exchange reaction @xmath11 on a bound neutron @xcite .",
    "new experiments are needed to confirm or refute the pentaquark existence .",
    "most of negative high energy experiments are high statistic hadron beam experiments .",
    "_ e.g. _ hera - b , a fixed target experiment at the 920 gev proton storage ring of desy @xcite finds no evidence for narrow signals in the @xmath12 channel and only sets modest upper limits for @xmath9 production of less than 16  @xmath13b / n and less than about 12@xmath14 relative to @xmath1 in mid - rapidity region .",
    "this negative result would present serious rebuttal evidence to worry about .",
    "however , without obvious production mechanism of the @xmath9 ( if it exists ) or even @xmath1 the rebuttal is not very convincing .    in this paper",
    "we estimate the high - energy behavior of the @xmath9 and @xmath1 production cross sections in inclusive @xmath2 collisions using the @xmath4 exchange diagram , which is known to survive at high energies in the beam / target fragmentation region . we show that the cross section of the @xmath9-production is suppressed compared to the production of @xmath1 .",
    "this suppression is mainly due to the smallness of the coupling constant @xmath15 compared to @xmath16 that in turn is related to the small width of the @xmath9 .",
    "as a byproduct we also estimate the contribution of the @xmath5 exchange diagram for the inclusive @xmath1 production in @xmath3 collisions .",
    "we assume that the @xmath9 exists . consider the @xmath9 production in the reaction @xmath17 where @xmath18 is unspecified inclusive final state carrying the strangeness -1 .",
