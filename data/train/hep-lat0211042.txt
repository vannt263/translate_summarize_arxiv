    "in ref . @xcite we suggested that the hybrid - monte - carlo simulation of dynamical wilson fermions can be substantially speeded up by a modification of the pseudo - fermion action .",

    "this bears the potential of changing the scaling behaviour of the hmc algorithm when the chiral limit is approached .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the modified pseudo - fermion action can be easily used on top of even - odd preconditioning of the clover - improved wilson fermion matrix .    in our numerical study",
    "we find that for lattice - spacings , quark masses and lattice sizes that recently have been used in large scale simulations @xcite a reduction of the numerical cost of more than a factor of two compared with the standard pseudo - fermion action can be achieved .",
    "one interesting observation in our study is that the partially improved scheme of sexton and weingarten does profit more from the modification of the pseudo - fermion action than the leap - frog scheme .",
    "in fact , this is not too surprising , since higher order schemes have more problems in the limit @xmath162 than the leap - frog scheme .",
    "this is nicely studied in @xcite and also found in recent large scale simulations @xcite .",
    "based on our experience it would be interesting to study genuinely higher order integration schemes combined with the modified pseudo - fermion action .",
    "there are a number of directions in which the present work could be extended .",
    "our general framework  ( [ general ] ) allows for a large variety of factorisations of the fermion matrix beyond our two choices of eqs .",
    "( [ orginal ] ) and  ( [ rainer ] ) .",
    "for example , one could divide the lattice in sub - lattices and construct the matrix @xmath46 by eliminating all hopping terms from @xmath52 that connect different sub - lattices .",
    "such a construction might be particularly useful for a massively parallel computer .",
    "an obvious idea is to enlarge the number of factors in eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) .",
    "this might be particularly advantageous , when we go to light quark masses . in order to keep the condition number of the factors of the fermion matrix constant as",
    "the quark mass becomes lighter , more factors have to be introduced .",
    "a related modification of the hmc algorithm has been proposed and tested in refs .",
    "the first difference compared with our approach is the factorisation of the fermion matrix : @xmath190 where @xmath191 is a low order polynomial approximation of @xmath192 .",
    "the order of the polynomial plays a similar role as the parameter @xmath3 in our approach .",
    "the use of the polynomial might allow for a better separation of the uv - part of the spectrum than our factorisation .",
    "on the other hand , the polynomial @xmath191 requires the introduction of an auxiliary field for each order of the polynomial .",
    "in contrast to us , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite put the two contributions of the pseudo - fermion action on different time scales of the integration scheme . in our case",
    "it would also be possible to put @xmath136 on the same time scale as @xmath193 .",
