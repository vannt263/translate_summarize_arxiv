    "the bias parameter ( kaiser 1984 ) is quantified as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the overdensity ( in galaxies or mass , respectively ) , @xmath1 is the _ rms _ mass fluctuation within a top - hat radius of @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the observed optical galaxy fluctuations on that scale ( davis & peebles 1983 ) .",
    "a bias of @xmath17 implies an unbiased universe , where mass follows light on these scales ( assuming a scale - independent bias on large scales ) , while @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) implies a highly biased universe , with mass distributed more widely than light .",
    "galaxy clusters are useful tools in cosmology .",
    "since clusters represent high density peaks , their present - day abundance directly reflects the amplitude of density fluctuations on the relevant cluster mass scale ; the latter corresponds to the mass enclosed within @xmath20 spheres in the early universe .",
