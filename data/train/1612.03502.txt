    "the threshold phenomenon _ `` deals with the minimal , an event , or stimulus just strong enough to be perceived or to produce a response '' _ @xcite and the presence of it _ `` imposes the restriction on the types of mathematical model suitable to describe '' _ biological / chemical systems @xcite .",
    "its extreme importance can be highlighted through examples .",
    "for instance , propagation of excitation in the heart involves action potential and threshold value controls if an applied stimulus is sufficient enough to generate an action potential .",
    "understanding the mechanisms of initiation of propagating is extremely crucial as successful propagation enables continuous electrical and chemical communication between cells and failure may lead to serious medical conditions @xcite . threshold phenomenon also plays a key role in understanding many age related diseases such as alzheimer and parkinson .",
    "studies on neuronal changes in brain suggest that the threshold hypothesis helps to explain _ `` some of the associations between clinical and pathological findings '' _ @xcite .",
    "originally , the term _ excitability _ has come to be used to refer to the _ `` property of living organisms to respond strongly to the action of a relatively weak external stimulus '' _ @xcite .",
    "a well - known example of excitability is the ability of nerve cells to generate and propagate electrical activity . by definition ,",
    "an excitable medium is a spatially distributed system , each element of which possesses the property of excitability and it is usually defined as nonlinear reaction - diffusion system , where the reaction term defines how the constituents of the system are transformed into each other , and the diffusion part provides propagation of information @xcite .",
    "there are a wide variety of areas where the term `` excitable medium '' has been used repeatably for decades in many fields including physical , chemical and biological systems and so on @xcite .",
    "we consider the problems of initiation of propagating waves in one - dimensional reaction - diffusion systems , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a @xmath2-component reagents field , @xmath3 , defined for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , vector - function @xmath6 describes the reaction rates and @xmath7 is the matrix of diffusivity .",
    "equation ( [ eq : intrds ] ) is assumed to describe an excitable medium as a system _ _ `` composed of elementary segments or cells , each of which possesses the following properties : 1 . a well - defined rest state , 2 . a threshold for excitation , and 3 . a diffusive - type coupling to its nearest neighbors .",
    "  stimuli below the threshold are damped out and produce no persistent change in the system ,   stimuli above the threshold induce the cell to change from its rest state to an excited state.''__@xcite a closely related class are bistable systems : whereas an excitable system proper returns to the resting state after spending some time in the excitable state , a bistable system remains in the excitable state for ever .",
    "a definitive feature of an excitable or bistable medium is existence of traveling wave solutions of ( [ eq : intrds ] ) .",
    "these can be described by transforming the system of partial differential equations ( pdes ) to a moving frame of reference , @xmath8 we are interested in the solutions that are stationary in this frame of reference , for a fixed @xmath9 , _",
    "@xmath10 if the velocity @xmath11 , then the traveling wave is called the standing wave .",
    "the traveling wave is a front if @xmath12 and @xmath13 exist and different from each other ( this is typical for bistable systems ) , and it is a pulse if @xmath14 ( this happens in excitable systems ) .    travelling wave solutions of ( [ eq : intrds ] ) have been a topic of intense study . for applications , for instance modelling of biological media and chemical processes , the question of particular importance is emergence of such solutions as a result of a perturbation of the resting state , localized in space and time . for a problem set on the half - infinite interval @xmath15 ,",
    "this can be formalized by initial and boundary conditions @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 describe the shapes of the initial and boundary profiles , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the strengths of those profiles .",
    "the cases of non - homogeneous initial condition and non - homogeneous boundary condition are usually handled separately . in electrophysiological terms , these can be described as follows :    1 .",
    "stimulation by current : @xmath21 .",
    "this is the case when the current is injected at the boundary point @xmath22 during some time interval . for a fixed boundary profile @xmath23",
    ", there exist a corresponding threshold strength value @xmath24 such that the solution tends to propagating wave ( `` ignition '' ) as @xmath25 whenever @xmath26 , and the solution tends to resting state ( `` failure '' ) otherwise . for a one - parametric family of profiles , parametrized by the stimulus duration @xmath27 , the corresponding curve @xmath28",
    "is called a strength - duration curve ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : decaysuc ] ) .",
    "2 .   stimulation by voltage : @xmath29 .",
    "here the perturbation is instantaneous at @xmath30 , but is spread in space . for a fixed initial profile @xmath31 , there exist a corresponding threshold strength value @xmath32 such that the solution tends to propagating wave as @xmath25 whenever @xmath33 , and to resting state otherwise . for a one - parametric family of profiles , parametrized by the stimulus extent @xmath34 , we shall have the corresponding critical curve @xmath35 , called a strength - extent curve .    in our previous paper",
    "@xcite we have analysed some analytical and semi - analytical approaches to description of the strength - extent curves . in this paper , we focus on the strength - duration curves . in all specific examples below we",
    "shall consider a rectangular profile of duration @xmath27 , @xmath36 where the fixed vector @xmath37 determines which reagents are being injected , and @xmath38 is the heaviside step function .        [",
    "fig : decaysuc ]      mathematically , the problem of determining the conditions of initiation of propagating waves in excitable or bistable media is spatially - distributed , nonstationary , nonlinear and has generally no helpful symmetries , so the accurate treatment is feasible only numerically .",
    "however , the practical value of these conditions is so high that analytical answers , even if very approximate , are in high demand .",
    "historically , there have been numerous attempts to obtain such answers , based on various phenomenological and heuristic approaches .",
    "here we review some of these attempts , in chronological order .",
    "phenomenological models describing experimental relationship between the minimum stimulus amplitude required to excite an axon and the duration for which the stimulus is applied first appeared well before the physical mechanisms of biological excitability have been discovered .",
    "the study of the charge - duration relation was first carried out by weiss  @xcite who experimentally derived the following linear equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the threshold charge and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are fitted parameters . in his original formula , weiss did not interpret the constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 physically and hence they were later on replaced by rheobasic current @xmath43 and chronaxie @xmath44 , so that @xmath45 and @xmath46  @xcite so ( [ eq : weissori ] ) becomes @xmath47 which is known as the weiss excitation law for the charge .",
    "an empirical equation developed by lapicque @xcite ) reiterated weiss s equation in a different form , for the relation between the pulse strength and duration , _",
    "i.e. _  the strength - duration curve .",
    "lapicque observed that the strength of the current @xmath20 required to stimulate an action potential increased as the duration @xmath27 was decreased .",
    "lapicque proposed the following current law for excitation @xmath48 which is equivalent to ( [ eq : weissori ] ) as @xmath49 .",
    "note that the rheobase current , @xmath44 may be defined as the minimal current amplitude of infinite duration for which threshold can be reached and that the chronaxie time of cell , @xmath43 refers to the value of the pulse duration @xmath27 at twice the rheobase current .    an alternative expression for threshold stimulating",
    "current was based on the idea that the nerve cell membrane could be represented by a parallel resistance @xmath50 and capacitance @xmath51 . the same lapicque paper , and also later blair  @xcite discussed a speculative model relying on an @xmath52 network to formulate the strength - duration curve .",
    "this resulted in the strength - duration relationship of the form @xmath53 lapicque - blair s exponential strength - duration curve looks similar to that given by the hyperbolic weiss - lapicque law ( [ eq : weisscharge ] ) , ( [ eq : lapiccur ] ) , and they nearly fit the same data  @xcite .",
    "lapicque - blair s model combines fairly accurately fit experimental outcomes with mathematical simplicity .",
    "thus , a number of researchers began to focus on it , among which three important ones are rashevsky  @xcite , monnier  @xcite and hill  @xcite .",
    "their results are equivalent up to the interpretation , but hill s article is the most cited .",
    "hill examined the relationship among the stimulus , the excitability of the tissue , and its accommodation , where the term `` accommodation ''  @xcite is used to describe the membrane potential response to a sufficiently slow increase in zthe stimulating current without exciting .",
    "a plausible mathematical description for a speculative dynamic variable describing the accommodation resulted in hill s two time - constant model @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 are the time constant of excitation and the time constant of accommodation , respectively .",
    "when @xmath57 and @xmath58 , hill s equation ( [ eq : hillists ] ) reduces to lapicque - blair s equation ( [ eq : blair1932 ] ) .    all above approaches",
    "were phenomenological and the parameters in the strength - duration relationships were to be fitted to experimental data rather than derived from `` first principles '' .",
    "study of spatial aspects of the initiation problem dates back at least to 1937 , when rushton @xcite introduced the concept of the `` liminal length '' , to represent the idea that in order to be successful , the stimulating current should excite a sufficiently large portion of the excitable cable .",
    "he supported this idea by a mathematical model of the nerve axon , which was of course linear ( passive ) , and the active character of the membrane and the existence of the excitation threshold were taken into account in a speculative , axiomatic manner .",
    "the situation of course changed radically after hodgkin and huxley have succeeded in producing a mathematical model describing the work of a nerve membrane based on experimentally established physical mechanisms .",
    "there were no more need for speculative modelling , but the real equations were strongly nonlinear , apparenly making analytical studies unfeasible and necessitating use of numerical methods .",
    "we note one such early study done by noble and stein  @xcite , who used a simplification of the hodgkin - huxley membrane model to explore numerically the influence of the membrane activation time and accommodation on the strength - duration curve .",
    "they also deduced that in the spatially - extended context , the strength - duration curve is highly dependent on the geometry of the stimulus .",
    "the analytical , or at least partly analytical , approaches started looking less unfeasible after the papers by mckean and moll  @xcite and flores  @xcite .",
    "they worked with one simple class , scalar bistable models .",
    "considering the corresponding pde on half - line with homogeneous boundary conditions as a dynamical system in a functional space , they have identified a critical role of one special solution , dubbed `` standing wave '' or , later , `` critical nucleus '' .",
    "this is a stationary , spatially non - uniform , unstable solution , with exactly one unstable eigenvalue .",
    "its special role is that its stable manifold forms the boundary between basins of attraction of `` successful '' and `` unsuccessful '' outcomes of a stimulation attempt .",
    "an example of an approach seeking to take advantage of this understanding is the work by neu _",
    "et al . _",
    "they considered a galerkin projection of the infinite - dimensional dynamical system described by the pde onto a two - dimensional manifold of spatial profiles , `` resembling '' the shape of a developing excitation wave on a half - line ( specifically , they used gaussians ) .",
    "this resulted in a second - order system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , in which the critical nucleus is represented by a saddle point , and the boundary between the basins is the stable separatrix of this saddle point .",
    "this however still left an open problem of describing analytically this separatrix .",
    "one possibility was explored by idris  @xcite , who approximated this separatrix by the stable space of the saddle , which yielded an analytical expression for the strength - extent curve .",
    "this expression , however , produced a result that was only qualitatively correct .",
    "the next step was using the linear approximation of the stable manifold right in the functional space .",
    "this idea was implemented by idris and biktashev  @xcite and rendered surprisingly good approximations of both strength - extent and strength - duration curves .",
    "naturally , this approach is applicable only to systems where there exists a critical nucleus .",
    "it obviously excludes , for instance , all excitable models .",
    "hence a question arises , what if anything is the equivalent of the critical nucleus in such systems .",
    "an answer to this question was proposed in another work by idris and biktashev  @xcite .",
    "it happens that in excitable systems , the role of the critical nucleus is played not by stationary , but by moving solutions with one unstable eigenvalue , `` critical pulses '' and `` critical fronts '' .",
    "these are unstable `` counterparts '' of the propagating wave solutions , existence of which was realised long before .",
    "finally in this brief review , the approach of @xcite was extended to the moving critical solutions by bezekci _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who also explored the possibility of using quadratic rather than linear approximation of the stable manifold .",
    "however , that paper only considered the strength - extent curve , which in the dynamical systems parlance is easier as it is about an autonomous systems .",
    "the question of strength - duration curve involves studying non - autonomous systems , and it is the subject of the present contribution .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to quantify the strength - duration curves , as an extension of the study  @xcite .",
    "we investigate how the quality of approximation produced by our method depends on the parameters that define various test systems .",
    "moreover , we investigate the feasibility of improving the accuracy by using a quadratic rather than a linear approximation of the critical manifold , and related problems .",
    "finally , we extend the method to the case where there are no critical nucleus solutions .",
    "this is observed in multicomponent reaction - diffusion systems , where it has been previously demonstrated that instead of a critical nucleus , one has unstable propagating waves , such as critical pulses  @xcite or critical fronts  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "after this introductory section , section [ sec : anathe ] describes the proposed analytical approach to the problem of the ignition of propagation waves in one - dimensional bistable or excitable media , from one - component with a critical nucleus to multi - component systems having moving critical fronts and pulses , including linear and quadratic approximation of the critical manifold .",
    "the strongly non - linear nature of the equations makes it unlikely that the ingredients of these approximations can be found analytically ; thus , a short outline of the numerical techniques used in the `` hybrid '' approach is given in the section [ sec : hybapp ] .",
    "the applicability of the approach will be illistrated for five different models from one - component examples zeldovich - frank - kamenetsky ( zfk ) and mckean detailed in section [ sec : onecomp ] , to multicomponent examples @xmath59-caricature , fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) and beeler - reuter ( br ) detailed in section [ sec : mutlicomp ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : disc ] concludes the paper with a short review of the results and some possible further research directions .",
    "[ sec : anathe ]    we aim at classification of the solutions of the system ( [ eq : intrds ] ) set on @xmath15 , @xmath60 , supplied with the following initial and boundary conditions , @xmath61 in terms of their behaviour as @xmath25 : whether it will approach the propagating wave solution ( `` ignition '' ) or the resting state ( `` failure '' ) .",
    "we find it convenient to formalize the initiation problem as one posed on the whole real line @xmath4 , @xmath62 where the boundary condition at @xmath22 in ( [ eq : semi - cable ] ) is formally represented by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the dirac delta function .",
    "the principal assumption of our approach is existence of a _ critical solution _ , which is defined as a self - similar solution ,    [ eq : buc ] ( , ) = ( -c ) , + = + c + ( ) , + ( ) = , ( -)=    which is unstable with one unstable eigenvalue . here",
    "@xmath65 may be different from @xmath66 but in our examples @xmath67 when @xmath68 .",
    "similar to the stable wave solution , there is then a whole one - parametric family of critical solutions , @xmath69 due to this translation invariance , the critical solution always has one zero eigenvalue . hence its stable manifold has codimension two , whereas its center - stable manifold has codimension one and as such it can partition the phase space , i.e. it can serve as a boundary between basins of different attractors .",
    "our strategy is to approximate this center - stable manifol . in the first instance",
    ", we consider a linear approximation , and in selected cases , we also explore the feasibility of the quadratic approximation .",
    "let us rewrite the system ( [ eq : rds - r ] ) in a frame of reference moving with a constant speed @xmath9 , so that @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 we linearize this equation on the critical solution , which is stationary in the moving frame @xmath74 the linearization gives @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the jacobian matrix of the kinetic term , evaluated at the critical solution and @xmath77 is the forcing term as measured in the moving frame of reference . equation ( [ eq : linearized ] ) is a linear non - homogeneous equation , with time - independent linear operator , @xmath78 for simplicity of the argument , we assume that the eigenfunctions of @xmath79 , @xmath80 are simple and form a basis in an appropriate functional space , and the same is true for the adjoint @xmath81  .",
    "another assumption , which simplifies formulas and is true for all examples considered , is that all eigenvalues important for the theory are real .",
    "we shall enumerate the eigenpairs in the decreasing order of @xmath82 , so by assumption we always have @xmath83 .",
    "then the general solution of problem ( [ eq : linearized ] ) in that space can be written as a generalized fourier series @xmath84 the coefficients @xmath85 will then satisfy decoupled odes , @xmath86 where @xmath87 the scalar product @xmath88 is defined as @xmath89 and @xmath90 are eigenfunctions of the adjoint operator , @xmath91 normalized so that @xmath92 the solution of ( [ eq : ajeqistsch3 ] ) is @xmath93 by assumption , @xmath94 , and due to translational symmetry , @xmath95 , and the rest of the spectrum is assumed within the left half - plane .",
    "since the stimulation is supposed to be finite in time , @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the condition of criticality is @xmath98 which implies @xmath99 from which we seek to obtain the critical curve based on this linear approximation .      using the definitions of @xmath100 and @xmath101",

    "however , it contains the parameter @xmath105 which still has to be decided upon .",
    "this question occurs already for the strength - extent curve , and we refer the reader to  @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "the new issue here is that for @xmath106 $ ] we are now dealing with a time - dependent problem .",
    "this is the case when @xmath107 , _ i.e. _  the critical solution is stationary , and moreover it is even in @xmath108 .",
    "then there is a natural choice of @xmath109 prescribed by symmetry .",
    "hence , ( [ eq : istslinformch3 ] ) gives the classical lapicque - blair formula  @xcite @xmath110 where the rheobase is @xmath111      in this case there is no @xmath112 symmetry and the choice of @xmath105 is no longer trivial . following the ideas discussed in @xcite , we assume that the linear approximation works best if the initial value for @xmath113 is the smallest , and it is the smallest in @xmath114 if not only @xmath115 but also @xmath116 .",
    "this helps to fix @xmath105 as small shifts of the critical solutions are equivalent to adding a small amount of @xmath117 .",

    "has introduced the spurious oscillations and first - order accurate result near the discontinuities due to beam - warming method , which can be tackled using some advanced shape - preserving advection schemes ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
