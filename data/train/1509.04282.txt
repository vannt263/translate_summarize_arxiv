    "this model has been investigated by many groups  @xcite .",
    "however , only recently it has been pointed out  @xcite that one can observe the gamma lines from dark matter annihilation in this context due to the fact that the final state radiation  ( fsr ) processes are suppressed in some regions of the parameter space .",

    "we focus on the discussion of gamma - ray lines and point out that two regions in agreement with all current experimental constraints exist where the final state radiation processes are suppressed with respect to the annihilation into photons .",
