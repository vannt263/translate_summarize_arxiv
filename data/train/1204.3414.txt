    "molecular gas consumption , mainly dominated by star formation and losing gas through outflow , plays an important role on star formation . to understand the molecular gas consumption in galaxies help us to study galaxies evolution .",
    "galaxies with violent star formation , especially in central nuclear region , are called starburst galaxies .",
    "they have star formation rates ( sfrs ) several to hundreds times higher than normal spiral galaxies .",
    "the strong star formation activities of starburst galaxies produce a large number of young and massive ob stars in a very short time .",
    "these massive stars finally end up their lifetime with supernova explosions .",
    "therefore , vast amount of stellar winds from massive stars and supernova explosions generate huge energy and high pressure to create high velocity galactic winds , which sweep up the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) and create galactic scale outflows or superbubbles .",
    "these scenarios have been described by several analytical models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and observational results ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "previous observations mainly focused on the warm ionized and hot plasma outflows , such as h@xmath11 emission observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and soft x - ray observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , the observations on molecular outflows or superbubbles are very rare in the past .",
    "lack of this study will cause under - estimation on the molecular gas consumption in galaxies , and have a bias to understand the galaxies evolution in our universe .",
    "the reasons for the rarity of molecular gas detections were mostly due to their diffuse / extended nature and poor instrumental sensitivities .",
    "recent improvements of various instruments provide a better chance to study the molecular outflows and superbubbles in galaxies .",
    "the recent techniques to detect molecular outflows and superbubbles in galaxies can be classified as three types : ( 1 ) high - velocity co wings to detect molecular outflows , e.g. , ngc  3256 @xcite , mrk  231 @xcite , m51 @xcite , ngc  1266 @xcite , and local ulirgs @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) p - cygni profile to detect molecular superbubbles , e.g. , arp  220 @xcite , and mrk  231 @xcite . ( 3 ) direct imaging at millimeter waveband for co molecular outflows and superbubbles , e.g. , molecular outflow in m82 @xcite , molecular superbubble in m82 @xcite , and molecular superbubbles in ngc 253 @xcite .",
    "the first and second techniques are useful to detect outflows and superbubbles from face - on galaxies .",
    "however , it is difficult to distinguish the molecular gas of outflows / superbubbles from that of galactic disk .",
    "therefore , we can not have an accurate measurement on molecular gas mass losing . to solve this problem",
    ", we need to observe edge - on galaxies by using the third technique .",
    "although this technique is time consuming , we can directly observe the morphology of molecular outflows and superbubbles , and therefore can have an accurate measurement on molecular gas mass losing .",
    "so far , only a few molecular outflows and superbubbles in galaxies have been directly imaged by using the third technique .",
    "more observations to directly image molecular outflows and superbubbles are necessary in order to understand the general properties of these structures and their influence on starburst activities .",
    "we have been conducting detail studies of one molecular outflow and two superbubbles toward the nearby edge - on starburst galaxy ngc 2146 @xcite . here",
    ", we provide another sample , ngc  3628 .",
    "starburst galaxy ngc  3628 is a member of the interacting leo triplet ( arp  317 ) , including ngc  3627 , ngc  3623 , and ngc  3628 .",
    "ngc  3628 is the north source in the leo triplet , ngc  3627 is the south one , while ngc  3623 is the southwest one .",
    "two signatures of tidal interaction in leo triplet are observed in several wavebands : a plume extending @xmath0  100  kpc from the eastern edge of ngc  3628 is detected in optical , far - infrared , and hi emission @xcite ; a bridge between ngc  3628 and ngc  3627 is detected in hi emission @xcite .",
    "these structures have been modeled by @xcite and were explained as a tidal interaction between ngc  3628 and ngc  3627 about 800  myr ago .",
    "ngc  3628 is a nearby ( d = 7.7  mpc ; 1@xmath12 = 37  pc ; @xcite ) , edge - on ( _ i _",
    "= 87@xmath13 ; @xcite ) , and ir luminous ( log @xmath14/l@xmath15 ; @xcite ) galaxy . the optical image of ngc  3628",
    "looks like a boxy shape ( @xcite ; see figure  [ opt - dss ] ) .",
    "radio observations @xcite show that ngc  3628 has a circumnuclear starburst . besides",
    ", a large - scale galactic wind has been detected in ngc  3628 .",
    "observations with rosat @xcite and chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ) @xcite show that ngc  3628 has an asymmetric plasma bipolar outflow with @xmath0 7  10 kpc scale in both north and south parts ; optical h@xmath11 observations also show that ngc  3628 has a @xmath0  10  kpc - scale warm plasma gas outflow @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect the existence of molecular outflows or superbubbles .",
    "@xcite claimed that their co(1 - 0 ) nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) observations detected four expanding molecular superbubbles , which are associated with the low velocity gradient ridge outside of the nuclear disk .",
    "however , no molecular outflow has been detected .",
    "our new co(1 - 0 ) nma observation detect a sub - kpc scale molecular outflow for the first time .",
    "we will discuss its properties , its impact on ngc  3628 , and its evolution by comparing with the cxo archival data .",
    "we have used the nma to observe the co(1 - 0 ) emission of ngc  3628 in the central @xmath0  1@xmath16 region .",
    "the observations were made during 2000 december to 2002 february with 3 different configurations of six 10-meter antennas .",
    "the total on - source time was @xmath0  40  hours .",
    "the phase tracking center was @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we used tunerless sis receivers @xcite , and observed the co(1 - 0 ) line in the upper side band .",
    "double side band system temperature was about 200  300  k for most of the observations .",
    "the backend used was the xf - type spectro - correlator ultra wide band correlator ( uwbc ; @xcite ) , configured to have 512  mhz bandwidth with 256 channels ( i.e. , a 2  mhz channel width or 5.2  km  s@xmath5 velocity resolution ) .",
    "we observed 3c  273 and 3c  279 as bandpass calibrators .",
    "the phase calibrator was 1055 + 018 , and amplitude calibrators were 1055 + 018 , 3c  84 , and 3c  345 .",
    "the flux scale of 1055 + 018 in 2000  2001 was determined by comparison with mars .",
    "that in 2001  2002 was determined by comparison with 3c  84 and 3c  345 , which were determined by comparison with mars , uranus , and neptune .",
    "the uncertainties in the absolute flux scales are estimated as 5  6@xmath19 in 2000  2001 and 10  12@xmath19 in 2001  2002 .",
    "the data were calibrated by using the nro software package `` uvproc ii '' @xcite , and were cleaned by using standard procedures implemented in the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the maps were made with natural weighting , with a final synthesized beam size of @xmath20 ( 147  pc  @xmath1  115  pc ) , which has a higher resolution than the past co(1 - 0 ) observations ( @xmath21 or 128  pc  @xmath1  123  pc ; @xcite ) . the position angle of the beam is @xmath22 .",
    "the noise level is 9.86  mjy  beam@xmath5 with a velocity resolution of 5.2  km  s@xmath5 , better than the previous observation of @xcite , 65  mjy  beam@xmath5 with a velocity resolution of 13  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "we obtained x - ray data from the cxo archive , which were originally observed by strickland et al . in 2000 december 2 with 60  ks total exposure time .",
    "it was observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "the nucleus of ngc  3628 is placed in the acis - s3 chip , which is a back illuminated ccd on the spectroscopic array .",
    "the back illuminated ccd is more sensitive to low - energy x - ray photons than the front - illuminated acis chips @xcite , and therefore is powerful to observe diffuse x - ray emission in low energies , such as the x - ray superwinds .",
    "the diffuse gas images of ngc  3628 have been published in @xcite , but the detail properties have not yet been discussed . in order to understand the properties of the diffuse gas , such as density , mass , energy , and pressure , we reprocessed the data , extracted the spectra , and performed model fittings .",
    "the data were reprocessed by using the chandra interactive analysis of observations software package ( ciao ) version 4.2 , and the chandra calibration database ( caldb ) version 4.2.2 , released on 19 april 2010 .",
    "we used the high energy analysis software ( heasoft ) version 6.5 , and the x - ray spectral fitting package ( xspec ) version 12.4 for further analysis .",
    "the background is chosen from a source - free circular region with a radius of 1@xmath233 centered at the position @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 away from the galactic center .",
    "the background level was 0.04 counts  s@xmath5  arcmin@xmath27 . to avoid the bias of choosing background ,",
    "we double checked with blank - sky subtraction .",
    "we used ciao script deflare and chose _",
    "sigma _ as the flare - cleaning method .",
    "after clipping data with count rates less than 3@xmath28 , the exposure time with good time intervals turned to be 56,319  s.    we only consider the data with energy between 0.3  kev and 7.0  kev .",
    "this is because the data with energy above 7.0  kev is dominated by x - ray background , and the data quality below 0.3  kev has large uncertainty due to poor calibration .",
    "we grouped the energy bins of the spectra from the selected region so that each bin would contain at least 20 counts to allow @xmath29 statistics for spectral fitting . in order to analyze the diffuse and extended x - ray emission",
    ", we used two ciao threads , wavdetect and celldetect , to detect point sources and removed them from the x - ray data . after removing detected point sources from the x - ray data , we used the ciao thread dmfilth to interpolate the emission at point source regions from their surrounding backgrounds .",
    "we summed every 4 channels (= 20.8  km  s@xmath5 ) from the original channel maps to reduce the rms noise level .",
    "the co(1 - 0 ) channel maps are shown in figure  [ chan ] .",
    "the noise level is 4.93  mjy  beam@xmath5 ( 68.8  mk ) . comparing to the noise level of @xcite , 65  mjy  beam@xmath5 with a velocity resolution of 13  km  s@xmath5 , which corresponds to 52  mjy  beam@xmath5 with a velocity resolution of 20.8  km  s@xmath5 ,",
    "the emission that @xcite detected is @xmath0 10@xmath28 and the second contour in our figure  [ chan ] .",
    "this suggests that we could detect 10 times weaker emission than that of @xcite .",
    "the emission in each channel shows that most of the gas is distributed along the galactic disk , and the structure in either one or both edges of the galactic disk is fragmented . besides , some extended diffuse features appear in the north of the galactic center in several channels .",
    "figure  [ mnt]a is our nma co(1 - 0 ) integrated intensity map ( moment zero map ) . most of the co emission is distributed along the galactic disk with a position angle of 104@xmath13 .",
    "the distribution of molecular gas in the galactic disk is not symmetric with respect to the major axis .",
    "the amount of the molecular gas above the major axis is more than that below the major axis . besides",
    ", both edges of the molecular disk are distorted .",
    "the eastern edge of the disk shows a boxy - shape structure , and the western edge of the disk is fragmented .",
    "both edges looks similar to the edges of the optical image ( figure  [ opt - dss ] ) although the scale is different .",
    "an extended emission located from the center with an offset of ( @xmath30r.a . , @xmath30dec . ) @xmath0 ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) labeled as _ of _ is the real emission because they also appear in the same position by mapping with uniform weighting .",
    "however , those centers with position offsets of @xmath0 ( @xmath31 , @xmath33 ) and @xmath0 ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) are considered as sidelobes because the positions of these features are either disappeared or shifted along with the beam patterns by mapping with uniform weighting or by choosing different uv - ranges .",
    "the existence of the strong sidelobes is due to the uv - coverage of a low - declination source , which generates strong sidelobes along the north - south direction .",
    "figure  [ mnt]b is the intensity weighted mean velocity map ( moment one map ) . from this map , we can see that there is a rigid - body rotation in the galactic center and a flat rotation in larger radii in the eastern part of the disk .",
    "the velocity in the northwestern part of the disk seems to be a flat rotation , but the southwestern part of the disk does not show a clear flat rotation feature . besides , the velocity in the western part of the disk is twisted and entangled . in order to further discuss the detail of these features ,",
    "we first rotate the moment zero map until the major axis of the galactic disk is the same with the horizontal direction , namely rotating clockwise for 14@xmath13 , as shown in figure  [ m0rot14 ] , and then we check the position - velocity ( hereafter @xmath36 ) diagrams parallel or perpendicular to the major axis .",
    "figure  [ pvmajor0 ] shows the major - axis @xmath36 diagram by averaging the @xmath36 diagrams within 2@xmath12 ( between @xmath37 and @xmath38 offsets ) from the major - axis . from figure  [ pvmajor0 ]",
    ", we found that the galactic disk consists of several structures : the curve between the position @xmath39 and @xmath40 indicates a rotation curve along the major axis of the galactic disk , namely , a rigid - body rotation between the positions @xmath41 and @xmath42 , with a flat rotation beyond these positions ; this suggests the existence of a large - scale molecular gas disk .",
    "the solid line between the positions @xmath43 and @xmath44 indicates a rigid - body rotation , suggesting the existence of an inner molecular disk .",
    "the ellipse between the positions @xmath45 and @xmath46 indicates the velocity feature more or less symmetric .",
    "this feature is similar to the @xmath36 diagram of our galaxy @xcite , suggesting the existence of a molecular bar @xcite in this galaxy .",
    "the solid line between the position @xmath45 and @xmath46 will be discussed in the following paragraph .",
    "figure  [ pvmajors ] shows averaged @xmath36 diagrams parallel to the major axis with various offsets .",
    "these @xmath36 diagrams are obtained by averaging every 2@xmath12 in the range between the position offsets @xmath47 and @xmath48 from the major axis ( see figure  [ m0rot14 ] for this range ) .",
    "the red solid curve , lines , and ellipse are the same as those in figure  [ pvmajor0 ] .",
    "we found that the structure of the molecular disk is not symmetric in the north - south direction .",
    "the inner disk can only be clearly seen in the position at the range between the offset @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the velocity feature of the bar structure can be seen in the position at the range between the offset @xmath34 and @xmath49 .",
    "in addition to these velocity features , we also found a rigid - rotation feature in the position at the range between the offsets @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the emission is weak while the slope is shallow , and the features extend to @xmath52 , so that this structure may be a rotating disk which is located at a large radius .",
    "here we call it an outer molecular disk .    in order to see the velocity feature of the extended structure _ of _ in the north of the galactic disk , we averaged the @xmath36 diagrams along the minor axis in the range between the position offsets @xmath37 and @xmath53 on the major axis ( see figure  [ m0rot14 ] for this range ) , and the averaged @xmath36 diagram is shown in figure  [ pvminor ] .",
    "the strong emission is distributed along the position offset of @xmath0 0@xmath12 , indicating the location of the galactic disk .",
    "northern part of the galactic disk ( positive side of the position offset ) obviously shows an extended diffuse emission , which corresponds to the extended structure _ of _ in figure  [ mnt]a and figure  [ m0rot14 ] .",
    "the velocity range of this diffuse emission is between @xmath54  + 70 km  s@xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "southern part of the disk ( negative side of the position offset ) shows no extended emission .",
    "the total molecular gas mass can be estimated from the co flux . the total co flux , @xmath55 , measured from our moment zero intensity map ( figure  [ mnt]a ) is @xmath0 8.01 @xmath1 10@xmath56  jy  km  s@xmath5 ( 1.12  @xmath57  k  km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath58 from the central @xmath59 of the galaxy ) . the total flux is four times larger than that measured by @xcite ( @xmath0 2.05 @xmath1 10@xmath56",
    "jy  km  s@xmath5 ) from the same region of the galaxy .",
    "this is because our high sensitivity nma observation provides a better sensitivity than @xcite ( as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ n3628-overall - prop ] ) so that we can detect much weaker emission .",
    "the total molecular gas mass derived from our co data , in units of m@xmath3 , can be calculated as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the distance in units of mpc , @xmath62 is the co - to - h@xmath63 conversion factor in units of @xmath9  k  ( km  s@xmath64 , and the factor 1.36 is a coefficient convert from molecular hydrogen gas mass to total gas mass , including helium @xcite . here , we used the value of @xmath62 = 1.4  @xmath1  10@xmath65  @xmath9  k  km  s@xmath5 @xcite , assuming the condition of the molecular gas is similar to that of m82 .",
    "thus the total gas mass , @xmath66 , is @xmath0 1.8 @xmath1 10@xmath67  m@xmath6 .",
    "the dynamical mass , @xmath68 within the radius of @xmath69 , can be derived from the rotational curve .",
    "figure  [ pvmajor0 ] shows that the maximum rotational velocity , @xmath70  km  s@xmath5 , appears at the location of radius @xmath0  40@xmath12 ( 1.5  kpc ) .",
    "we assume a circular rotation for the galactic disk , @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , the dynamical mass within 1.5  kpc radius can be estimated as @xmath0 2 @xmath1 10@xmath72  m@xmath73 .",
    "this indicates that the gas mass to dynamical mass ratio of 10% , which is the typical value for the central regions of galaxies ( c.f .",
    ", from 4% for sa galaxies to 25% for scd galaxies ; @xcite ) .        in order to compare the cxo x - ray data with the nma co(1 - 0 ) data in different scale , we made two types of smoothed images .",
    "to image the large scale diffuse structure , we used the ciao tool aconvolve to convolve the point - source - removed x - ray image with a gaussian that is smoothed by 25@xmath12 in 2 energy bands , soft ( 0.3  2.0  kev ) and hard ( 2.0  7.0  kev ) bands .",
    "we also tried to smooth with 20@xmath12 , but the diffuse emission can not be displayed clearly .",
    "the smoothed soft and hard x - ray images are shown in figure  [ xray - img]a and figure  [ xray - img]b , respectively .",
    "these two images are very similar to those published by @xcite , suggesting that our imaging is consistent with theirs . in soft - band x - ray emission ( figure  [ xray - img]a ) ,",
    "the strongest intensity is very close to the galactic center , but shifted a little bit toward the north . an asymmetric plasma outflow located above and below the galactic center",
    "is clearly seen .",
    "the northern plasma outflow has a stronger intensity and wider distribution than the southern outflow , while the southern outflow extends longer distance than the northern one .",
    "the diffuse emission spreads over @xmath0 7  10 kpc scale in both north and south of the galactic disk . in hard - band x - ray emission ( in figure  [ xray - img]b ) , the strongest intensity is at the galactic center .",
    "the emission is roughly concentrated in the galactic center , and we do not see clear evidence of the outflow feature .",
    "the overlaid images between the cxo x - ray data and the nma co(1 - 0 ) data are shown in figure  [ xray - co]a and figure  [ xray - co]b .    to image the small scale diffuse structure , we used aips task convl to convolve the x - ray data to the same beam size as ( @xmath74 ) as the nma co(1 - 0 ) data in 2 energy bands . the high resolution soft and hard x - ray images are shown in figure  [ xray - co]c and figure  [ xray - co]d , respectively . in the higher resolution soft - band x - ray emission map ( figure  [ xray - co]c ) , the distribution of the plasma outflow near the galactic center is roughly located in similar region as the extended molecular gas feature _ of _ , while the peak intensity of the x - ray emission is located a little bit toward the north . in the higher resolution hard - band x - ray emission map ( figure  [ xray - co]d ) ,",
    "the distribution is concentrated in the galactic center .      in order to compare the physical properties of plasma gas to that of molecular gas",

[ sec - ion - prop ] ) .    for this spectral analysis",

    "the hi line emission is distributed along the galactic disk . after comparing the distribution of x - ray emission , hi emission , and the extended molecular gas _ of _ ,",
    "we specified / defined two fitting regions , _ core _ and _",
    "halo_. for simplicity , we defined the region _",
    "core _ as a circular area with a radius of @xmath0  0@xmath233 ( 0.67  kpc ) , which includes the central strong x - ray emission in the hi disk and the feature _ of _ ( figure  [ xray - co]a , [ xray - co]c , and [ xray - hi]a ) .",
    "meanwhile , we defined the region _",
    "halo _ as a circular area with a radius of @xmath0  3@xmath230 ( 6.72",
    "kpc ) , which includes all diffuse x - ray emission but excludes the region _",
    "core_.    the temperature @xmath75 , and the normalization term @xmath76 , depend on the absorption column density and the metal abundance of the galaxy .",
    "the absorption column density of atomic hydrogen , @xmath77 , can be fitted with the photoelectric absorption model , wabs . in _ core _ , the absorption is affected by both the host galaxy and the milky way .",
    "since the absorption in the host galaxy is unknown , we left @xmath77 as a free parameter . in _",
    "halo _ , x - ray emission has no counterpart in the hi disk , thus we only consider the absorption from the milky way .",
    "we therefore fixed @xmath77 as milky way absorption column density , 0.02  @xmath1  10@xmath78  @xmath9 @xcite .    for the metal abundance , we identify o ( @xmath0 0.5  0.7  kev ) , si ( @xmath0 1.8  1.9  kev ) , and fe ( @xmath0 0.7  1.0  kev ) in the _ halo _ spectrum ( figure  [ xray - spec]a ) , and mg ( @xmath0 1.3  1.4  kev ) , si ( @xmath0 1.8  1.9  kev ) , and fe ( @xmath0 0.7  1.0  kev ) in the _ core _ spectrum ( figure  [ xray - spec]b ) .",
    "the existence of these lines suggests that the emission originates from optically - thin thermal plasma @xcite .",
    "thus we can choose a thermal - plasma model from xspec , i.e. , vmekal or vapec .",
    "since the data quality of the _ halo _ spectrum is poor at energy lower than 0.4  kev and higher than 1.3  kev , we intended to exclude these data .",
    "in addition to considering the metal abundance of si at @xmath0  1.8  1.9  kev , we include data at higher energy side till 3.0  kev .",
    "therefore , the soft - band energy range is 0.4  3.0  kev .",
    "we begin to fit the spectrum with an absorbed single - temperature thermal - plasma model .",
    "however , the spectrum can not be fitted well neither by wabs*vmekal nor by wabs*vapec model .",
    "thus we tried to fit the spectrum via an absorbed two - temperature thermal - plasma model , i.e. , wabs*(vmekal + vmekal ) or wabs*(vapec + vapec ) .",
    "we also fix the metal abundances of the higher temperature component to those of the lower temperature component .",

    "two temperatures are @xmath0  0.47  kev and 7.3  kev .",
    "we notice that both the metal abundance of mg and si are extremely high .",
    "these values are likely not physical . besides",
    ", their large uncertainties ( 1.5  25.9  @xmath79 for mg and 5.3  50.8  @xmath79 for si ) suggest that the fitted values are not accurate enough .",
    "one possible reason is that the ccd material contaminates the detection of si .",
    "another possible reason is that the photon counts , @xmath80 counts , are too low to get a reasonable fitting results for mg and si . we fix the metal abundances of mg and si as unity and re - fit the spectrum again .",
    "this does not change @xmath75 and _ norm _ too much .",
    "therefore , we could ignored the influence from high abundances of mg and si .      from @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we could derive mean electron density @xmath81 , plasma mass @xmath82 , thermal pressure @xmath83 , and thermal energy @xmath84 .",

    "superbubble b has a coordinate of ( @xmath123 , @xmath38 , @xmath124  km  s@xmath5 , 33  km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "its @xmath36 diagram is shown in figure  [ abc - pvmajor]b , and its intensity map , which is integrated along the velocity range of 29  95 km  s@xmath5 , is shown in figure  [ abc - mnt0]b .",

    "the emission distribution at position b in the @xmath36 diagram looks different from that at its symmetric position , which has a coordinate of ( @xmath125 , @xmath38 , @xmath126  km  s@xmath5 , 33  km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "namely , there is almost no emission at position b , but there is emission detected at its symmetric position .",
    "an explanation for this asymmetric is that the molecular gas at the position b has been blown up .",

    "we depict their superbubble d in figure  [ abc - pvminor ] by a thin cross and a thin dashed ellipse .",
    "interestingly , our deep observation detected more diffuse emission .",
    "the enclosed loop marked as a thick dashed ellipse , which represents the structure of a superbubble , is smaller than that of irwin & sofue s thin dashed loop .",
    "we identify the thick loop as the superbubble d with a coordinate of ( @xmath35 , @xmath44 , @xmath132  km  s@xmath5 , 50  km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "since a shift of 1@xmath12 from superbubble d is smaller than the angular resolution of @xmath0 3@xmath12 , we conclude that the superbubble d and d are identical , but the superbubble d has a more accurate coordinate than the superbubble d. the radius of the superbubble d can be estimated from figure  [ abc - pvmajor]c and figure  [ abc - pvminor ] , @xmath133 ( @xmath0 186  pc @xmath1 186  pc ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results only confirm the existence of the superbubble d , superbubble a and c are likely to be parts of the bar structure , while superbubble b could be either part of the bar structure , or a past superbubble whose molecular gas has already been blown up .",
    "the mis - interpretation is possibly due to the low sensitivity of the previous observation .      in order to figure out the evolution of the molecular outflow _ of _ , we compare the pressure between the diffuse molecular gas _ of _ and the plasma gas in the _ core _ region .    in the molecular outflow _ of",

    "besides , the ram pressure that _ of _ suffered from the plasma outflow can be derived by @xmath138 = @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the relative velocity between the expansion velocity of _ of _ , @xmath121 , and of the plasma outflow , @xmath141 .",

    "@xmath150 is highly depending on two processes , mass loss through molecular outflow , and star formation , @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the molecular gas mass in the starburst region , and the sfr is the star formation rate .    from sec .",

    "<S> we found that the distribution between the molecular outflow and the strong plasma outflow seems to be in a similar region . in this region , the ram pressure and the thermal pressure of the plasma outflow are 10@xmath8 dyne  @xmath9 , and the thermal pressure of molecular outflow is 10@xmath10 dyne  @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies the molecular outflow is still expanding outward . </S>",
