    "investigation of structure of a composite system by means of quasi - elastic knockout of its constituents has been playing a very important role in the micro - physics  @xcite . in a broad sense",
    ", the term `` quasi - elastic knockout '' means that a high - energy projectile ( electron , proton , etc . ) instantaneously knocks out a constituent  an electron from an atom , molecule or solid film  @xcite , a nucleon  @xcite or cluster @xcite from a nucleus , a meson from a nucleon  @xcite or nucleus  @xcite  transferring a high momentum in an `` almost free '' binary collision to the knocked - out particle and leading to controllable changes in the internal state of the target .",
    "such process corresponds to the feynman pole diagram fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "exclusive quasi - elastic knockout coincidence experiments resolve individual states of the final system ( different channels of the virtual decay of the initial composite system into a constituent and a final system - spectator in a given excited state ) .",
    "first of all , such experiments , in accordance with the laws of binary collisions  @xcite , give the missing momentum and energy , i.e. the momentum of the constituent and its binding energy in the channel being considered .",
    "of course , these values should be much smaller than momentum and energy of the final knocked - out particle . by varying kinematics",
    ", one can directly measure the momentum distribution ( md ) of a constituent in different channels .",
    "for example , in the case of nuclei , such experiments make it possible to determine the momentum distributions of nucleons in different nuclear shells .",
    "second , in such experiments , it is possible to measure spectroscopic factors of constituent separation in various channels . for nuclei ,",
    "the spectroscopic factors determine probabilities of exciting different states of the residual nucleus - spectator @xmath11 after the knockout of a nucleon from the initial nucleus @xmath12 ( it corresponds to the spectrum of relevant fractional - parentage coefficients  @xcite , used in the theory of many - particle nuclear shell model ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we discuss a problem of how the above - mentioned experience can be extended to the investigation of a quark microscopic picture of meson cloud in the nucleon .",
    "we investigate here a pion production on nucleons by electrons with energy of a few gev within the kinematics of quasi - elastic knockout .",
    "we rely on both the corresponding international literature  @xcite and our previous results  @xcite .",
    "our relativistic analysis is done within the instantaneous form of dynamics in the initial proton rest frame ( laboratory frame ) as far as the kinematics criterion of the quasi - elastic character of the process ( a large momentum of the knocked - out particle and a small recoil momentum of the residual system - spectator ) is especially distinct here . if this reference frame is accepted , a significant contribution from the pole @xmath13-diagram ( fig .",
    "[ f1]b ) should be taken into account , too .",
    "the corresponding amplitude may easily be obtained from the amplitude of the diagram fig.[f1]a using the crossing symmetry relations  @xcite .    within the quasi - elastic knockout kinematics ( which includes",
    "the condition @xmath14 1 - 3 ( gev/@xmath15)@xmath16 , @xmath17 being the 4-momentum squared of the virtual photon ) the pole mechanisms of fig .",
    "[ f1]a and fig .",
    "[ f1]b dominate  @xcite .",
    "the physical attractiveness of such kinematics in the quasifree collision can be illustrated , in particular , by the fact , that the problem of the gauge invariance of the knockout process is reduced here to that for the two - body electron - meson free collision , i.e. to the solved problem ( see formal comments below and in refs .",
    "the authors of a preceding pioneering papers  @xcite have analyzed an exclusive pion electro - production experiment @xmath18 @xcite with @xmath19 values ranging from 0.7 to 3.3 ( gev/@xmath15)@xmath16 within the pole approximation and have reconstructed the md of pions in the channel @xmath20 .",
    "but the problem of how much non - pole diagrams are suppressed here and how to make this suppression maximal by varying kinematics was not discussed .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the light - front dynamics was used and the mds were expressed in terms of ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) variables . this approach may be very helpful in more complicated cases ( the interference of many different diagrams ) as far as the contributions of all @xmath23-diagrams disappear here , but for our simplest situation of two pole amplitudes with the common vertex function such approach is not indispensable .",
    "further , papers  @xcite contain an important note that while for pion photo - production reactions ( @xmath24 ) contributions of the @xmath0-pole and @xmath25-pole diagrams are compatible , for the pion electroproduction the relative contribution of non-@xmath0-pole diagrams decreases with increase of the @xmath19 value .",
    "but as far as the sum of the @xmath0-pole and @xmath25-pole diagrams is maintained gauge invariant  @xcite , the @xmath0-amplitude itself , being very predominant at @xmath14 1 - 3 ( gev/@xmath15)@xmath16 , becomes gauge invariant with a good accuracy .    in the papers",
    "@xcite , it was also pointed out that the rosenbluth separation  @xcite permits us to extract from the @xmath26 experiment at large enough @xmath19 values not only the md of pions in nucleon ( analyzing the longitudinal cross - sections @xmath27 ) but also the md of rho - mesons in nucleon ( analyzing the transverse cross - sections @xmath28 and having in mind the non - diagonal subprocess @xmath29 ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we follow this way , but , as a first step , consider only pionic and kaonic clouds in the nucleon .",
    "namely , we extract from the @xmath26 experimental data on @xmath27  @xcite the pion md @xmath30 and show , as a confirmation of our approach , that it is very close to md determined independently from a @xmath31-potential @xcite , which had been reconstructed from @xmath31 scattering data .",
    "but we do not restrict ourselves by this phenomenology and also consider here , as a central point , a quark microscopic picture of the pionic and kaonic clouds .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the quasi - elastic knockout method is very suitable for the investigation of microscopic properties of many - particle systems . in the present paper , such system",
    "is exemplified by a nucleon considered within the quark model of @xmath10 scalar fluctuation @xcite . in this model",
    "the nucleon is characterized by a @xmath32 configuration with a meson as a virtual composite ( @xmath9 ) particle .",
    "conceptually , the situation is similar to that for virtual clusters in the atomic nuclei , where the valuable opportunities of quasi - elastic knockout were discussed in details @xcite ( e.g. , the deexcitation of a virtual excited cluster in a nucleus by a proton blow in @xmath33 reaction ) .",
    "the channels of the virtual decay @xmath34 ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 roper ) ) and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 , @xmath8 ) are considered in our microscopic approach , the corresponding mds @xmath39 , @xmath40 and spectroscopic factors @xmath41 , @xmath42 are calculated , having in mind possible experiments in jlab . from the formal point of view",
    ", the main problem here is the re - coupling of quark coordinates when forming the virtual meson . in the shell - model theory of nucleon clustering in light nuclei , this problem had been solved long ago by joining the many - particle fractional - parentage technique with the talmi - moshinsky - smirnov ( tms ) transformation of the oscillator wave functions from a single nucleon coordinates to the cluster jacobi coordinates  @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed , that all this physics of `` soft '' hadron degrees of freedom in the nucleons and nuclei discussed in the present paper and connected with the moderate @xmath19 values 2 - 4 ( gev/@xmath15)@xmath16 remains beyond the interests of the scientific community . its attention is concentrated on the frontier problem of quark asymptotic degrees of freedom  @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath43 ( gev/@xmath15)@xmath16 and very small cross - sections .",
    "the general aim of the present paper is to renew the interest in the investigation of the hadron virtual components in nucleons and nuclei .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the second section ,",
    "the relativistic theory of quasi - elastic knockout reactions @xmath44 is briefly presented , following refs .",
    "the third section contains analysis of the basic formal problem of projecting the nucleon @xmath32 wave function into the different @xmath45 and @xmath46 channels within the microscopic @xmath10 model .",
    "the resulting momentum distributions and spectroscopic factors are discussed in the final fourth section .",
    "the general expression for the pion electro - production cross section is well known  @xcite :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 are , respectively , 4-momenta of a target particle and of a recoil particle ( baryon ) ; @xmath52 is the invariant mass of final hadrons , @xmath53 being 4-momentum of a product particle ( meson ) ; @xmath54 , @xmath55 being the virtual - photon 4-momentum ; @xmath56 is the angle between the plane spanned by the initial and final electron momenta @xmath57 and the plane spanned by the @xmath58 momenta ; the quantity @xmath59 ^{-1 } \\label{e2}\\ ] ] characterizes the degree of longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon , @xmath60 is electron s scattering angle , and @xmath61 @xmath62 is the initial - lepton ( electron ) energy , @xmath63 is the target mass , and @xmath64 is the fine structure constant .",
    "finally , @xmath65 is the longitudinal cross section , @xmath66 is the transverse one , and @xmath67 , @xmath68 represent the interference terms  @xcite .    experimental results are presented in terms of @xmath69 . for the longitudinal virtual photons the electromagnetic vertex of the diagram fig .",
    "[ f1 ] is characterized by a subprocess @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "all other subprocesses are suppressed at @xmath71 ( gev/@xmath15)@xmath16 . for the transverse photons a non - diagonal subprocess @xmath72 @xcite begins to dominate over @xmath70 at large enough @xmath73 ( @xmath71 ( gev/@xmath15)@xmath16 ) .",
    "so , the rosenbluth separation  @xcite of the cross section into longitudinal @xmath65 and transverse @xmath66 parts permits us to investigate both the pionic structure of the nucleon and its @xmath74-meson structure by means of the same process of exclusive pion electroproduction . in the present paper , we consider , as a first step , only the pionic and kaonic clouds ( only the longitudinal cross sections ) .    according to the general rules of the field theory  @xcite , the wave function of a pseudo - scalar constituent @xmath21 in the target @xmath75 , which corresponds to the pole diagram fig .",
    "[ f1]a , is defined as    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is an amplitude of the process of virtual decay @xmath78 .",
    "the probability to find particle @xmath21 in the channel of virtual decay @xmath78 is characterized by the spectroscopic factor @xmath79 with the integration measure given by @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "it is convenient to define the `` radial '' part @xmath81 of the wave function ( [ e5 ] ) as @xmath82 that is normalized to the spectroscopic factor  ( [ e6 ] ) by the equation @xmath83 .",
    "the formulas presented above are quite general : they are valid for atoms , nuclei , and hadrons .",
    "we will now specify these formulas for the case of the quasi - elastic knockout of pions from nucleons .",
    "so , @xmath84 is an initial nucleon momentum ; @xmath85 is a final nucleon momentum ; and @xmath86 is a final pion momentum .    in the reactions with longitudinal photons ,",
    "a process with the virtual pions @xmath87 dominate over processes with other kinds of virtual mesons .",
    "so , to obtain the pion wave function , we need experimental data on the longitudinal cross section @xmath65 .",

    "( [ cc ] ) and ( [ rto ] ) , which , in turn , is a result of @xmath434 spin - flavor symmetry of initial interaction hamiltonian  ( [ hs ] ) . to obtain absolute values of these constants",
    "we must normalize the only free parameter of the model , @xmath168 , to a known vertex constant @xmath297 , and it gives @xmath435 -5.1 , @xmath436 1.0 , if @xmath423 1 , but in a more realistic case , when @xmath423 0.5 , it gives @xmath437 , @xmath438 . for comparison , refs .",
    "@xcite give us the following values : @xmath439 , @xmath440 @xcite and @xmath441 , @xmath442  @xcite .    to refine these values and to clarify the origin of enhancement of the @xmath443 cross section the measurement of kaonic mds in the channels @xmath444 and @xmath443 ( both their normalizations and shapes )",
    "should be very important .",
    "basing on the microscopical @xmath10 model we have predicted the pionic mds , both the shape of @xmath191-dependence and normalization , i.e. spectroscopic factor , in the channels of virtual decay @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and kaonic mds in the channels @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the microscopic consideration can be easily extended to higher excited states of the baryon - spectator @xmath147 using the more advanced relativistic version of the @xmath10 model .",
    "these mds can be efficiently verified in the quasi - elastic knockout experiments @xmath384 and @xmath445 at the electron beam energy of a few gev .",
    "such broad verification should be an important ground for further improvement of microscopical quark models , which provide us with the valuable universal basis for consideration of various meson clouds .",
    "our nearest intention here consists in consideration of the transverse cross section @xmath446 of the process @xmath384 .",
    "it opens a way to the investigation of the @xmath74-meson md @xmath447 via very predominating ( at @xmath448 gev@xmath16/@xmath449 ) virtual subprocess @xmath450 ( @xmath451 means a virtual particle ) .",

    "further , as a next step , an amplitude of a non - diagonal subprocess @xmath453 with rearrangement of the nonzero internal orbital momentum @xmath454 of the virtual pion @xmath455 to @xmath456 can be extracted from the properly organized experiment , if we take into account our experience in the physics of clusters in the nucleus .",
    "namely , the theory of quasi - elastic knockout of clusters from nuclei by intermediate energy protons @xcite shows that the amplitudes of deexcitation of virtually excited clusters [ say , @xmath457 play very important role here .",
    "these amplitudes can be revealed by very large anisotropies of differential cross sections in regards to the orientation of the recoil momentum @xmath458 of the final nucleus - spectator @xmath459 with respect to the bombarding beam direction ( @xmath460-anisotropy ) and to proton scattering plane ( @xmath461-anisotropy , i.e. treiman - yang anisotropy  @xcite ) . for electrons with only single electron - quark collisions",
    ", the effect will be probably not so big , but quite observable  @xcite .",
    "it seems reasonable to join the above microscopic approach with virtually excited mesons in the nucleon and the experience of the phenomenological theory of regge poles as applied to the analysis of electroproduction of pions and kaons  @xcite .",
    "such synthesis can illuminate microscopical ground of the regge theory .",
    "the present paper , where we use a `` naive '' non - relativistic model of scalar @xmath10 fluctuation , aims to outline preliminarily a new horizon in both experimental and theoretical intermediate energy research of nonpertubative qcd as a basis for detailed explanations and predictions of various meson - baryon degrees of freedom .",
