    "<S> _ introduction  _ the pressure applied by active particles to surfaces and objects has been a recent subject of interest @xcite . generally this pressure depends on the details of the interaction with the wall @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it has been shown that under certain conditions equilibrium - like properties of the pressure are retrieved . for spherical particles , pressure is a state function , independent of the wall potential @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> in fact , it is necessary to break both time reversal and space inversion symmetries in order to do so @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> time reversal symmetry in these systems is broken by the interactions between the active particles and the objects . in previously studied active </S>",

    "<S> we study the pressure exerted by non - interacting point - like active particles with an activity gradient . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , a symmetric inert object can be moved due to the pressure , since space inversion symmetry is broken by the gradient in the motion parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this work is motivated by recent experiments @xcite which observed the motion of the oocyte ( immature egg cell ) nucleus from the cortex to the center , due to a gradient in the activity of vesicles . </S>",
    "<S> we wish to find microscopic rules of motion for the vesicles , modeled as active particles , which explain the observed quantities : vesicle density and velocity profiles , and the resulting velocity of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , our work can describe synthetic systems in which activity can be spatially controlled @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that for spherical active particles @xcite pressure is a state function which depends on the bulk density and the motion parameters . </S>",
    "<S> since the particle dynamics do not conserve momentum , a gradient in the motion parameters can cause a pressure gradient which exerts a force on an object immersed in the active fluid . </S>",
    "<S> we ask whether this force is simply given by an integral of a local pressure over the object s surface . </S>",
    "<S> if so , for a constant pressure gradient the force is equal to the pressure gradient times the object s volume , analogously to the archimedes principle ( ap ) for the buoyant force on an object submerged in a fluid under gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the force on a passive body in the presence of a gradient of activity in one and two dimensions , and show how the ap needs to be modified in active fluids .    </S>",

    "<S> _ consider a 1d system of run - and - tumble particles , with position - dependent speed @xmath0 and tumble rate @xmath1 @xcite , which are confined by hard walls in the domain @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the walls have no effect on the orientation of the particles , as they do not experience torque @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we neglect thermal diffusion and interactions between the particles , both for simplicity and because they have been found to be negligible in the biological system of interest ( the oocyte @xcite ) . a symmetric object in such a system is a piston with identical surfaces on its two sides . </S>",
    "<S> to find the force the particles apply to the piston , we first calculate the density of the particles within the bounded domain , in the absence of a piston . the density is discontinuous at the walls , where a macroscopic number of particles accumulates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore write rate equations for the bulk densities of left and right moving particles @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite , in addition to coupled equations for the numbers of particles accumulated on the walls : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the currents of right and left moving particles , and @xmath8 is the number of left / right - moving particles at the boundary position @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the number of particles accumulated on a wall that are moving away from it is zero ( i.e. @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we set the total particle number to @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the total particle density . under this constraint , the steady state solution of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the wall accumulation depends on the local value of @xmath16 , but not on the _ local _ @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> the force on each of the walls can be calculated using the density . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the force on the right wall is given by the number of accumulated particles moving against the wall @xmath17 , multiplied by the force a single particle applies , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the translational mobility : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the persistence length .    </S>",

    "<S> we denote the position of the piston s center by @xmath22 , the piston s width by @xmath23 , and the positions of the left and right edges of the piston by @xmath24 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1d](a ) ) . </S>",

    "<S> the force on the piston is thus given by @xmath27 the piston divides the system into two disconnected parts , and the force on it depends on the number of particles in each part , which determines the values of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we choose to set @xmath29 , as would happen in the large system size limit where the density profile is not affected by the insertion of an object . </S>",
    "<S> it is also true for periodic boundary conditions at @xmath30 , and in higher dimensions for objects that do not divide the system into disconnected parts . </S>",

    "<S> the force on each edge of the piston is proportional to the local @xmath42 since it is the product of the number of particles accumulated on the piston edge , which is @xmath46 , and the force exerted by each particle , which is @xmath47 . </S>",

    "<S> ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) ]    in 1d we calculated the total force the particles apply to the piston in a straight - forward way , using the number of particles accumulated on its edges . to do so , we had to find the steady state particle density profile . </S>",
    "<S> for a similar 2d system , finding the steady state density is difficult @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , using the method of @xcite , it is possible to find the force on an object using the bulk density only , in the limit of small persistence length @xmath68 . </S>",

    "<S> assume the object s surface potential is very narrow . </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite , by using moments of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : master_eq ] , and the fact that the force on the object is given by @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is an area containing the object and no other potentials , we obtain the following expression for the total force the particles exert on the object ( see appendix 1 ) : @xmath77 where the axes were chosen such that @xmath78 , @xmath79 is a unit vector normal to @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is a line element along @xmath80 . we define the integrated current @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the current density , and @xmath84 , with @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : f_tot ] shows that the force can be divided into three terms , which we denote from left to right @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated current term @xmath88 is the only possibly non zero term in the case of constant parameters @xcite . in this case , for a symmetric object such as a disk , @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the surface integral term @xmath89 is the dominant term in the case of small @xmath42 with respect to the object lengthscales ( see appendix 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath80 is in the bulk , @xmath92 for the local pressure @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> thus for a linear gradient in @xmath42 , @xmath89 has the form of the ap , i.e. it is proportional to the area of @xmath76 , which is approximately the area of the object for @xmath76 along and slightly outside of the object surface , and independent of its shape ( see appendix 2 ) . in 1d , this is the only non vanishing term ( see appendix 4 ) .    . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the average force on a modulated disk ( @xmath95 ) as a function of @xmath96 , divided into 3 components , for varying modulation amplitude : @xmath97 @xmath98 ( solid ) , @xmath99 ( dashed ) , @xmath100 ( dotted ) and @xmath101 an area concentric with the disk with edge at distance @xmath102 from the disk center . </S>",

    "<S> simulation results : the total force - black , @xmath89 - red , @xmath90 - yellow , @xmath88 - blue . the theoretical calculation of @xmath89 ( eq .  [ eq : archimedes_res ] ) is plotted in green . as the modulation amplitude increases , the total force on the disk is increased due to a reduction in magnitude of @xmath90 and an increase in @xmath88 , which at first decreases in magnitude and then changes sign ( f axis is transformed using a log - modulus of @xmath104 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( c , d ) the current density around the disk for a modulation amplitude of 0 ( c ) and 2 ( d ) for @xmath105 . see appendix 6 for additional details . </S>",

    "<S> as @xmath42 grows , the current of particles slipping around the object grows and the integrated current @xmath88 and area integral term @xmath90 grow and cause a deviation of the total force from @xmath89 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2d_pbc ] ) . for a disk , the two correction terms </S>",
    "<S> were observed in simulations to have opposite sign from @xmath89 , and thus reduce the total force ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2d_pbc](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the correction terms seem to be related to slippage of particles on the surface , we checked whether the force on the disk can be enhanced by reducing the slippage and decreasing these terms . </S>",
    "<S> we added a sinusoidal modulation to the disk radius : @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the polar angle around the disk center . </S>",
    "<S> we keep @xmath89 constant by using a linear @xmath42 gradient and keeping the area of the object constant , to isolate the effects of the other two terms . </S>",
    "<S> we find that indeed magnification of the total force can be achieved by modulation of the edge ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2d_pbc](b ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion  _ we showed that while the ap applies in 1d , in 2d it generally needs to be modified and is valid only for a small persistence length . </S>",
    "<S> when the ap applies , the force exerted by the particles on an object is an integral over a local pressure that is proportional to the persistence length . </S>",
    "<S> thus this force tends to push objects in the direction of @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that it is possible that the force on the container is nonzero , which is enabled by the breaking of momentum conservation by the particle motion dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> our model parameters and results can be linked to experimental measurements of particle trajectories , even if sampled at low frequency with respect to the persistence time @xmath52 : knowing the long time mean squared displacement and the particle density is sufficient to determine @xmath0 and @xmath114 ( see appendix 8) . </S>",
    "<S> the force calculation for a passive object holds for a moving body in the limit where its velocity is slow with respect to the velocity of the active particles , such that the particles attain their steady state distribution throughout the motion . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , since the system is overdamped , the velocity of the object is proportional to the force exerted on it . </S>",
    "<S> thus our force calculation can be used to obtain the velocity of slow moving objects .    </S>",
    "<S> returning to the oocyte @xcite , the vesicle density was observed to be approximately uniform , while the measured vesicle velocity increases from the center to the edge of the cell . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant force on the nucleus pushes it towards the cell center . </S>",
    "<S> since the sample time used for obtaining the vesicle positions was of the order of magnitude of @xmath52 ( see appendix 9 ) , the measured velocity depends both on the microscopic @xmath15 and @xmath52 , making it possible that the observed spatial variation is due to a variation in either of them . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results are consistent with our model for the case of a @xmath52 that increases from the center to the edge , and a constant @xmath15 ( see fig .  [ </S>",
