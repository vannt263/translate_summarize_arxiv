    "underwater acoustics can fulfil the needs of a multitude of underwater applications .",
    "this include : oceanographic data collection , warning systems for natural disasters ( e.g. , seismic and tsunami monitoring ) , ecological applications ( e.g. , pollution , water quality and biological monitoring ) , military underwater surveillance , assisted navigation , industrial applications ( offshore exploration ) , to name just a few @xcite . detection of hydroacoustic signals is characterized by a target probability of false alarm and probability of detection .",
    "the detection is performed for a buffer of samples , @xmath1 , recorded from the channel ( usually in a sliding time window fashion ) . in this paper , the focus is on detection of signals of known structure .",
    "the applications in mind are active sonar systems , acoustic localization systems ( e.g. , ultra - short baseline ) , and acoustic systems used for depth estimation , ranging , detection of objects , and communications .    in this paper , we focus on the first step in the detection chain , namely , a binary hypothesis problem where the decoder differentiate between a _ noise - only _ hypothesis and a _ signal exist _ hypothesis .",
    "the former is when the sample buffer , @xmath1 , consists of ambient noise , and the latter is the case where the sample buffer also includes a distinct received hydroacoustic signal . without channel state information , the most common detection scheme is the matched filter @xcite , which is optimal in terms of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in case on an additive white gaussian channel .",
    "the matched filter detector is a constant false alarm rate ( cfar ) test , and its detection threshold is determined only by the target false alarm probability ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . due to the ( possibly ) large dynamic range of the detected signal @xcite , and for reasons of template matching @xcite , the matched filter is often normalized by the noise covariance matrix .",
    "this normalization is often referred to as adaptive normalized matched filter ( anmf ) and is the preferred choice in several tracking applications such as gradient descent search , active contour models , and wavelet convolution @xcite .    to estimate the noise covariance matrix , several noise - only training signals",
    "are required @xcite . since this limits the application , and since the noise may be time - varying , various anmf detectors have been developed .",
    "based on the noise texture model , @xcite suggested a maximum likelihood estimator for the noise covariance matrix .",
    "alternatively , in @xcite an iterative procedure is performed where first the covariance matrix is assumed known and the test statistics for a signal vector is calculated .",
    "next , using these statistics and additional noise - only vectors , the noise covariance matrix is estimated and is substituted back into the test statistics . in @xcite , an adaptive matched subspace detector is developed and its statistical behavior is analyzed to adapt the detector to unknown noise covariance matrices in cases where the received signal is distorted compared to transmitted one .",
    "the above normalization methods of the matched filter require an estimation of the covariance matrix of the ambient noise .",
    "as shown in @xcite , mismatch in this estimation effects detection performance and target false alarm and detection rates may not be satisfied . since in underwater acoustics the noise characteristics are often fast time varying @xcite , an alternative detection scheme is to normalize the matched filter with the power of @xmath1 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we refer to this scheme as the _ normalized matched filter _ ( nmf ) , as opposed to the anmf .",
    "the nmf detector does not require estimation of the noise covariance matrix .",
    "instead , its detection threshold depends only on the time - bandwidth product , @xmath0 , of the expected signal . for underwater applications which require detection at target performance in various noise conditions",
    ", the nmf may be a suitable choice .    in @xcite , a low - rank nmf",
    "is suggested , where the linear matched filter is normalized by the power of the transmitted signal and a projection of the detected one .",
    "the projection is made according to the estimated noise covariance matrix , and the result is a simplified test which is proportional to the output of the standard colored - noise matched filter .",
    "a modification of the matched filter is proposed in @xcite for the case of a multipath channel .",
    "the works in @xcite and @xcite include analysis for the false alarm and detection probabilities of the nmf .",
    "this analysis is either a modification of a similar study of the nmf or is based on semi - analytic matrix representation .    due to low signal - to - noise ratio and the existence of narrow band interferences ,",
    "hydroacoustic signals are constructed with a large time - bandwidth product of typical values @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "while the nmf has been analyzed before , for large @xmath0 the available expressions are computationally complicated to evaluate .",
    "consequently , it is difficult to evaluate the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) , which is required to determine the detection threshold . as a result , most underwater applications avoid using the nmf as a detector . considering this problem and based on the probability distribution of the nmf and its moments , in this paper computationally efficient approximations for the probability of false - alarm and for the probability of detection for signals of large @xmath0",
    "are offered .",
    "this leads to a practical scheme for the evaluation of the roc .",
    "simulation results show that the developed expressions are extremely accurate in the large @xmath0 limit . to test the correctness of the analysis in real environment ,",
    "results from a sea experiment are reported .",
    "the experiment was conducted in the mediterranean sea to detect chirp signals reflected from the sea bottom at depth of 900  m.    the reminder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is presented in section  [ sec : model ] . in section  [ sec : distribution ] , we derive the probability distribution of the nmf and give expressions for the probability of false alarm and for the probability of detection .",
    "next , performance evaluation in numerical simulation ( section  [ sec : simulation ] ) and results from the sea experiment ( section  [ sec : experiement ] ) are presented in section  [ sec : performance ] .",

    "the goal of this paper is to offer a computational efficient determination of the detection threshold of the nmf for signals with large @xmath0 property .",
    "since the nmf is executed at the very first step of the reception chain , the receiver poses no information of the channel or range to transmitter .",
    "therefore , only an additive noise of unknown variance can be assumed for the system model .    for a received signal , @xmath1 , we consider a binary detection test of hypotheses , @xmath3 in ( [ e : hypo ] )",

    "we assume that @xmath0 is large ( values exceeding 50 are enough ) . in our analysis",
    "we consider the case of real signals .",
    "however , as demonstrated in section  [ sec : performance ] , the analysis holds for the case of complex signals .",
    "we are interested in the following quantity ( referred to as the nmf ) , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the @xmath12th sample of @xmath4 and @xmath1 , respectively , and @xmath1 is sampled equally at the nyquist rate . for a detection scheme which uses correlator ( [ e : nmf ] ) as its detection metric , the objective is to develop computational efficient expression for the probability of false alarm and for the probability of detection .",
    "both figures are required to determine the detection threshold through the roc .",
    "the strong assumption in this paper is of i.i.d zero - mean gaussian noise @xmath7 with variance @xmath13 . as discussed in section  [ sec : simulation ] , effect of mismatch in the noise model is shown negligible .",

    "however , this may not be applicable to all considered cases .",
    "instead , the _ correct _ asymptotic can be found by expanding @xmath57 around its saddle - point .    to that end , let us go back to expression ( [ e : pd_distribution ] ) .",
    "denoting @xmath71 , and introducing @xmath72 , ( [ e : pd_distribution ] ) takes the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",

    "the experimental setting was about 10  km off the shores of haifa , israel , at depth of roughly 900  m. the set included a surface vessel from which a transmitting projector and a receiving hydrophone have been deployed .",
    "the experiment included 600 hydroacoustic transmissions .",
    "each transmission consisted of two linear frequency modulation chirp signals , spaced by a time gap of 100  msec , whose carrier frequency was 50  khz , bandwidth 10  khz , and whose duration varied between : 10msec , 50msec , and 100msec .",

    "several @xmath104 values were tested by changing the amplification level of the transmitted signals .",
    "transmissions were made at depth of 10  m , and signals were received at depth of 100  m. this depth difference allowed sufficient separation between the receptions of the direct path , surface path , and bottom path , while allowing the use of a narrow voltage range to reduce quantisation errors .",

    "the results for the detection rates are given in table  [ t : exppdres ] alongside the predicted approximation ( [ e : pd2 ] ) .",
    "since for high values of @xmath0 the probability of detection changes little with @xmath0 ( see fig .  [ f:4 ] ) , results for @xmath125 are accumulated .",

    "however , for lower @xmath101 / @xmath102 ratios , detection performances are below the expected level .",
    "this is explained by the effect of the non - linear channel ( especially the doppler shift phenomena and non - resolved multipath ) , which distorts the received signal and thus reduces the output of the nmf . nonetheless , the performance gap is minor , and the results of the sea experiment mostly agree with the analysis .",
