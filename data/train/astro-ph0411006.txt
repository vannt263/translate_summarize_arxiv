    "damped  absorption ( dla ) systems are thought to probe the high - redshift analogy of neutral gas regions that resembles the disks of nearby luminous galaxies and represent a unique sample for studying the interstellar medium ( ism ) of distant galaxies at redshifts as high as the background qsos can be observed .",
    "these absorbers are typically selected to have neutral hydrogen column density @xmath11 . to date",
    ", substantial progress has been made to establish the chemical enrichment history in the cold gas traced by the dla systems .",
    "results obtained by various authors ( e.g.   pettini et al .  1999 ;",
    "prochaska et al .",
    "2003a ) indicate that the mean metallicities observed in the dla systems are substantially lower than the mean metal content observed in the solar neighborhood ( e.g.  sofia & meyer 2001 ) at all redshifts that have been studied .",
    "the low metal content observed in dla systems suggests that these absorbers do not trace the bulk of star formation , particularly because galaxies at redshift @xmath12 exhibit a strong luminosity - metallicity correlation  more luminous galaxies are also more metal enriched ( e.g.  kobulnicky & zaritsky 1999 ; tremonti et al .",
    "consequently , this would suggest that the dla systems are not likely to be the progenitors of present - day luminous disk galaxies .",
    "recent analysis presented by wolfe et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) suggests , however , that the dla systems may contribute equally to the star formation rate density at @xmath13 as the luminous starburst population selected at rest - frame uv wavelengths ( e.g.  steidel et al .  1999 ) .",
    "wolfe et al .",
    "further propose that the discrepancy between high star formation rate and low metallicity in the dla systems may be understood if star formation occurs in a compact region that has little cross section .",
    "identifying the stellar content of the dla galaxies is clearly essential for understanding the nature of the absorbing galaxy population .",
    "but this has been a challenging task , because these galaxies are faint and located at small projected distances to the bright background qsos ( as implied by the intrinsic high column density of the absorbers ) . despite extensive searches in the past decade ,",
    "the number of known dla galaxies has remained relatively small .",
    "of all the 23 dla systems found at @xmath14 , 13 have been identified with their host galaxies using either spectroscopic or photometric redshift techniques ( rao & turnshek 1998 ; lane et al .  1998 ; miller , knezek , & bregman 1999 ; turnshek et al .",
    "2001 ; cohen 2001 ; bowen , tripp , & jenkins 2001 ; chen & lanzetta 2003 ; lacy et al .",
    "2003 ) , six systems have host candidates found in deep images ( steidel et al .  1994 ; le brun et al .  1997 ; rao et al .",
    "2003 ) , and two systems still remain unidentified after substantial search efforts ( steidel et al .   1997 ; cohen 2001 ) .",
    "based on a study of eight dla systems along seven lines of sight , le brun et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have pointed out that galaxies giving rise to low - redshift dlas display a wide range of morphologies .",
    "chen & lanzetta ( 2003 ) studied the 11 galaxies that have been confirmed at the time to produce dla systems and showed that typical @xmath15 galaxies at @xmath16 are surrounded by an extended neutral gaseous envelope of radius @xmath17 kpc at @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , when a known galaxy luminosity function is adopted , the neutral gas cross - section weighted luminosity distribution of field galaxies would produce the observed luminosity distribution of dla galaxies .",
    "this result lends strong support for the idea that galaxies selected by association with known dla systems are representative of the field galaxy population and that a large contribution of dwarfs ( @xmath19 ) to the total neutral gas cross section is not necessary .",
    "but it also underscores the issue of the apparent low metallicity of the dla population .",
    "we have been pursuing a spectroscopic study of @xmath12 galaxies known to produce dla systems , in order to understand the low metallicity nature observed in the absorbers .",
    "here we present moderate resolution spectra of four previously known dla galaxies toward pks0439@xmath20433 ( @xmath21 ) , q0738@xmath22313 ( @xmath23 ) , ao0235@xmath22164 ( @xmath24 ) , and b20827@xmath22243 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we also add two dla galaxies toward q0809@xmath22483 ( @xmath26 ) and lbqs0058@xmath220155 ( @xmath27 ) that are confirmed in our spectroscopic program .",
    "furthermore , metallicity measurements of the neutral gas are available from the literature for the dla systems toward b20827@xmath22243 ( khare et al .",
    "2004 ) and lbqs0058@xmath220155 ( pettini et al .",
    "we present two new measurements for the dla systems toward pks0439@xmath20433 and ao0235@xmath22164 based on the ultraviolet spectra of the background qsos retrieved from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) data archive .",
    "combining known metallicity measurements of the absorbers with known optical properties of the absorbing galaxies yields a galaxy - dla pair sample that has two unique applications .",
    "first , it allows us to go beyond simple cross - section measurements and to establish an empirical correlation between the kinematics and metallicity of the absorbers and those of the absorbing galaxies .",
    "a particularly interesting aspect of this application is to investigate whether or not the low metal content of the dla population arises naturally as a combination of gas cross - section selection and metallicity gradients commonly observed in local disk galaxies ( e.g.  zaritsky et al .",
    "1994 ; ferguson , gallagher , & wyse 1998 ; van zee et al .",
    "second , the sample offers a means of studying the disk population at intermediate redshift using galaxies selected uniformly based on known neutral gas content ( @xmath28 ) , rather than optical brightness or color .",
    "specifically , we will study disk evolution based on a comparison of the tully - fisher relation of the dla galaxies and those of field galaxies .",
    "we describe our observations and data reduction in   2 and present spectral properties of the galaxy and absorber pairs toward individual sightlines in   3 . in   4 , we investigate the tully - fisher relation of dla selected galaxies and chemical abundance profiles of galactic disks .",
    "finally , a summary is presented in   5 .",
    "throughout the paper , we adopt a @xmath29 cosmology , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with a dimensionless hubble constant @xmath32 .",
    "we have obtained moderate - resolution spectra of six absorbing galaxies toward the lines of sight of pks0439@xmath20433 , q0738@xmath22313 , q0809@xmath22483 , ao0235@xmath22164 , b20827@xmath22243 , and lbqs0058@xmath220155 , using the magellan telescopes at las campanas and mmt on mt .",
    "these galaxies are known to give rise to strong  absorbers of @xmath33 ( e.g.   rao & turnshek 2000 ; chen & lanzetta 2003 ) .",

    "the image surrounding the field of pks0439@xmath20433 was obtained using the tek#5 ccd imager with an @xmath34-band filter on the du pont telescope at las campanas ( chen & lanzetta 2003 ) . the images surrounding q0809@xmath22483 , ao0235@xmath22164 , b20827@xmath22243 , and lbqs0058@xmath220155 were obtained using hst , the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) with the f702w filter .",

    "no image surrounding q0738@xmath22313 is available in public data archives , but a deep @xmath35-band image is published in turnshek et al .",
    "these high spatial resolution images allowed us to measure accurately the inclination angles of disk galaxies ( pks0439@xmath20433 , q0809@xmath22483 , and b20827@xmath22243 ) for rotation curve studies .",
    "we have also searched through the hst data archive and located moderate - resolution , ultraviolet and optical spectra of the background qsos , pks0439@xmath20433 and ao0235@xmath22164 .",

    "this frame was used to subtract the contaminating qso light from the galaxy spectrum in the subsequent analysis .",
    "a spectrophotometric standard was observed at the beginning and the end of each night for flux calibration .",
    "all the spectroscopic data were processed following the standard data reduction procedures .",
    "individual ccd frames were first bias subtracted using available iraf tasks and flattened using a median image of three spectroscopic flat frames obtained for each pointing . for low - resolution spectra , a single spectrum was extracted and wavelength calibrated from each exposure . by using skylines in our science exposures the wavelength zero - point calibration was accurate to better than 0.5  .",
    "wavelengths were further corrected to vacuum and heliocentric for comparisons with absorption - line measurements .",
    "individual , extracted spectra were stacked to form a combined spectrum after rejecting deviant pixels .",
    "the stacked spectra were calibrated to an absolute flux scale using the sensitivity function derived from the spectrophotometric standards observed in each night .",

    "comparisons of the continuum fluxes between blue and red grating tilts in the spectra obtained for pks0439@xmath20433 and q0738@xmath22313 showed that the flux calibrations are consistent to within 5% .",
    "finally , we corrected for the telluric a- and b - band absorption features at 7600   and 6870   in each stacked galaxy spectrum , using the much higher signal - to - noise ratio spectra of the spectrophotometric standards .    for the high - resolution spectra , individual frames were first registered using the continua and emission - line features and then stacked to form a combined two - dimensional spectrum .",

    "we extracted one - dimensional spectra around the targeted emission features from individual rows , and estimated the line centroid per spectrum by fitting a gaussian profile to the data to determine a velocity offset of the emission - line region along the slit .",
    "adjacent spectra were correlated between one another due to atmospheric seeing , and therefore the observed inner slope of the rotation curves of the galaxies is expected to be shallower than the intrinsic shape .",
    "nevertheless , the observations allow us to compare for each system the relative kinematics between the ionized gas of the ism and the neutral gas of the absorber along the disk and to determine the disk rotation speed .",

    "all abundance measurements are normalized to their respective solar values .",
    "note that the dla toward ao0235@xmath22164 is presented at its projected distance to the absorbing galaxy , because the galaxy exhibits complex morphology that can not be represented by a simple disk model .",
    "we find in all three cases an abundance decrement by a factor of @xmath239 ( or 0.45  0.7 dex ) from the center of the galaxies to neutral gaseous clouds at @xmath240 kpc galactic radii , corresponding to a radial gradient ranging from @xmath241 to @xmath242 dex kpc@xmath55 .",
    "these values are consistent with the range of abundance gradients observed in local disk galaxies ( zaritsky et al .   1994 ) .",
    "we note that although the ism abundances are derived based on strong emission lines characteristic of star forming hii regions , the emission - line based abundance measurements are representative of the mean metal content of the local atomic and molecular phases as well .",
    "the results in figure 15 suggest that these three dla systems originate in the relatively unevolved outskirts of galactic disks .",
    "there are , however , systematic uncertainties that may reduce the gradients seen in the three dla galaxies presented in figure 15 .",
    "first , the strong - line ",
    "empirical \" hii region abundance scale has been called into question recently , because direct abundance measurements based on electron temperature ( @xmath243 ) sensitive auroral lines tend to give abundances that are systematically lower by 0.20.5 dex ( e.g.  kennicutt et al .  2003 ; bresolin et al .  2004 ) .",
    "such uncertainty has an impact on the interpretation of figure 15 , where the strong - line hii region abundances are being compared to absorption line abundances using completely different methods .",
    "if we would lower the hii region abundances shown in figure 15 by 0.20.5 dex , the radial gradients would be reduced substantially in at least two of the three systems ( b20827@xmath22243 and ao0235@xmath22164 ) .",
    "but it is unclear whether this correction should be applied in full .",
    "recombination line abundances for galactic hii regions yield results that are intermediate between the @xmath243-based and strong - line values ( e.g.  esteban et al .",
    "moreover , we have not included a dust depletion correction in the oxygen abundance measurements for these two systems .",
    "including depletion correction would increase the abundances by @xmath244 dex ( e.g.  esteban et al .",
    "second , the fraction of fe locked in dust is observed to be higher at higher metallicity regime , although there is a large scatter about the mean relation ( e.g.  pettini et al .  1997 ; prochaska et al .",
    "2002 ) . we have adopted a median [ zn / fe ] ratio to estimate a depletion correction for the dla systems toward pks0439@xmath20433 and b20827@xmath22243 .",
    "the correction may be underestimated particularly for the dla system toward pks0439@xmath20433 , for which we have derived a dust - depletion corrected metallicity of nearly solar , @xmath62 =   -0.14 \\pm 0.30 $ ] .",
    "an underestimated fe abundance would also reduce the abundance gradient observed in figure 15 for the dla system . to assess the systematic uncertainty due to metallicity - dependent dust - depletion correction",
    ", we adopt the empirical relation between depletion fraction @xmath245 and metallicity @xmath62 $ ] from vladilo ( 2004 ) based on a study of 34 dla systems that have observed fe abundance ranging from @xmath62_{\\rm   obs}=-2 $ ] to @xmath246 and dust - depletion corrected fe abundance ranging from @xmath62 = -2 $ ] to @xmath247 .",

    "we therefore conclude that the systematic uncertainty due to metallicity - dependent dust - depletion correction is insignificant in the absorption - line abundance measurement for this dla system .",
    "finally , the abundance gradients observed in figure 15 is based on comparisons between oxygen and iron abundances with respect to the typical solar values , but it is not clear whether the ( o / fe ) ratio is solar in the dla systems .",
    "an abundance pattern with enhanced fe would steepend the abundance gradients , and enhanced oxygen would reduce the gradients .",

    "to minimize the systematic uncertainties discussed above , we study metallicity gradients by considering only absorption - line abundances .",
    "we investigate whether there exists a statistical correlation between absorption - line metallicity and galaxy impact parameter using an ensemble of six galaxy - dla pairs for which fe abundance measurements in the absorbers are available . given a mix of galaxy morphology , here",

    ".    equation ( 4 ) shows an anti - correlation between metallicities in the cold gas and galaxy impact parameter at the 3-@xmath43 level of significance , which applies to galaxy - dla pairs within an impact parameter range of @xmath257 kpc .",
    "the slope of the abundance profile agrees well with the oxygen abundance gradient observed in the hii region of m101 , although flat metallicity distributions are also observed in some nearby disk galaxies ( e.g.  zaritsky et al .",
    "the agreement supports the idea that the dla population traces galactic disks at intermediate redshifts .",
    "figure 16 also suggests that at @xmath258 kpc the neutral gas phase metallicity may already be approaching the igm abundance floor at @xmath253 .",
    "we note that including intrinsic @xmath223-band luminosity of the absorbing galaxies does not improve the fit and shows little correlation between metallicity and galaxy luminosity using the small galaxy - absorber pair sample .",
    "consistent results have been presented by different authors over the past few years to show that the mean metallicities observed in the dla systems are only a tenth of the solar values at all redshifts that have been studied ( e.g.  pettini et al .  1999",

    "our prediction is consistent with observations to within errors at @xmath10 , where the reported mean metallicity is @xmath264 ( prochaska et al .",

    "the difference between the two sets of @xmath7-weighted mean metallicity measurements from prochaska et al .  and kulkarni et al",

    "we argue based on the monte - carlo simulations that to obtain a representative estimate of the cosmic mean metallicity in the neutral gas phase requires a sample of dla systems collected from @xmath272 random lines of sight .    finally , we draw attention to the scatter in metallicity displayed in figure 17 .",

    "<S> we present a spectroscopic study of six damped  absorption ( dla ) systems at @xmath0 , based on moderate - to - high resolution spectra of the galaxies responsible for the absorbers . combining known metallicity measurements of the absorbers with known optical properties of the absorbing galaxies , we confirm that the low metal content of the dla population can arise naturally as a combination of gas cross - section selection and metallicity gradients commonly observed in local disk galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the tully - fisher relation of the dla - selected galaxies and find little detectable evidence for evolution in the disk population between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> additional results of our analysis are as follows . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) the dla galaxies exhibit a range of spectral properties , from post - starburst , to normal disks , and to starburst systems , supporting the idea that dla galaxies are drawn from the typical field population . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) large rotating  disks of radius @xmath3 kpc and of dynamic mass @xmath4 appear to be common at intermediate redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) using an ensemble of six galaxy - dla pairs , we derive an abundance profile that is characterized by a radial gradient of @xmath5 dex per kiloparsec ( or equivalently a scale length of @xmath6 kpc ) from galactic center to @xmath3 kpc radius . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) adopting known @xmath7 profiles of nearby galaxies and the best - fit radial gradient , we further derive an @xmath7-weighted mean metallicity @xmath8 for the dla population over 100 random lines of sight , consistent with @xmath9 observed for @xmath10 dla systems from prochaska et al . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis demonstrates that the low metal content of dla systems does not rule out the possibility that the dla population trace the field galaxy population . </S>"
