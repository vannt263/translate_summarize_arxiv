    "it is central for the investigation of , e.g. , the thermodynamic cost of quantum operations , such as quantum gates , which form the basis of quantum computation and quantum information processing @xcite .    one possible strategy to overcome the difficulties that the two measurements scheme poses has been proposed in refs",

    "[ sec : extensions ] , this new method offers a very promising tool for accessing the work statistics of systems that are strongly coupled to their environment @xcite .",

    "such devices have undergone a tremendous and fast development in the last decade @xcite , allowing for the experimental study of light - matter physics in parameter regimes that standard quantum - optics experiments can not reach @xcite and with an unprecedented flexibility .",
    "for example , in a circuit qed device , one can easily manipulate the level spacing of the qubit , which can span a whole range of values , from being resonant with the oscillator , to being far detuned from it .",
