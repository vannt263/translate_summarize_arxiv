    "the study of degradation and stabilization of polymers is important both from practical and theoretical viewpoints @xcite .",
    "disposal of plastic wastes has grown rapidly to a world problem so that increasing environmental concerns have prompted researchers to investigate plastics recycling by degradation as an alternative @xcite . on the other hand , degradation of polymers in different environment",
    "is a major limiting factor in their application .",
    "recently , with the advent of exploiting biopolymers as functional materials @xcite , the stability of such materials has become an issue of primary concern .",
    "most theoretical investigations of polymer degradation have focused so far on determining the rate of change of average molecular weight @xcite .",
    "the main assumptions of the theory are that each link in a long chain molecule has equal strength and equal accessibility , that they are broken at random , and that the probability of rupture is proportional to the number of links present .",
    "experimental studies of polystyrene , however , have revealed discrepancies @xcite with the theory @xcite so , for example , the thermal degradation stops completely or slows down markedly when a certain chain length is reached .",
    "only few theoretic studies @xcite have recently explored how does the single polymer chain dynamics affect the resulting bond rupture probability . in both studies , however , for the sake of theoretical tractability one has worked with a model of a gaussian chain bonded by linear ( harmonic ) forces whereby the anharmonic ( non - linear ) nature of the bonding interactions was not taken into account .",
    "one could claim that the process of thermal degradation still remains insufficiently studied and understood .",
    "meanwhile , recently it was found experimentally @xcite that covalent bonds may spontaneously break upon adsorption of brush - like macromolecules onto a substrate .",
    "one studied brushes consisting of a poly(2-hydroxyethyl metacrylate ) backbone and a poly(@xmath1-butyl acrylate ) ( pab ) side chains with degrees of polymerization @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and found spontaneous rupture of covalent bonds ( which are otherwise hard to break ) upon adsorption of these molecules on mica , graphite , or water - propanol interfaces @xcite .",
    "as the densely grafted side chains adsorb , they experience steric repulsion due to monomer crowding which creates tension in the backbone .",
    "this tension , which depends on the grafting density , the side chain length , and the extent of substrate attraction , effectively lowers the energy barrier for dissociation , decreasing the bond life time @xcite .",
    "thus , one may observe amplification of bond tension from the pico - newton to nano - newton range which facilitates thermal degradation considerably .    also recently , in several works panyukov and collaborators @xcite predicted and theoretically described the effect of tension amplification in branched macromolecules .",
    "they argued that the brush - like architecture allows focusing of the side chain tension to the backbone whereby at given temperature @xmath14 the tension in the backbone becomes proportional to the length of the side chain , @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the maximum tension in the side chains is @xmath16 with @xmath17 -being the boltzmann constant , and @xmath18 - the kuhn length ( or , the monomer diameter for absolutely flexible chains ) .",
    "the effect of adsorption - induced bond scission might have important implication for surface chemistry , in general , and for specific applications of new macro- and supramolecular materials , in particular , for example , by steering the course of chemical reactions .",
    "one may use adsorption as a convenient way to exceed the strength of covalent bonds and invoke irreversible fracture of macromolecules , holding the key to making molecular ( dna ) architectures that undergo well - defined fragmentation upon adsorption .    in the present investigation",
    "we explore the process of chain fragmentation in desorbed and adsorbed bottle - brush macromolecules by means of a coarse - grained bead - spring model and langevin dynamics . in section [ model ]",
    "we describe briefly our model and then present our simulation results in section [ md_results ] .",
    "a summary of our results and conclusions is presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "anticipating , one might claim that the reported results appear in good agreement with observations and theoretical predictions .",
    "we consider a @xmath19 coarse - grained model of a polymer chain which consists of @xmath0 repeatable units ( monomers ) connected by bonds , whereby each bond of length @xmath18 is described by a morse potential , @xmath20 with a parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the dissociation energy of such bonds is @xmath22 , measured in units of @xmath23 , where @xmath17 denotes the boltzmann constant and @xmath14 is the temperature .",
    "the maximum restoring force of the morse potential , @xmath24 , is reached at the inflection point , @xmath25 .",
    "this force @xmath26 determines the tensile strength of the chain . since the bond extension @xmath27 between nearest - neighbor monomers along the polymer backbone in our @xmath19-model is always positive , the morse potential eq .",
    "( [ morse_pot ] ) is only weakly repulsive and segments could partially penetrate one another at @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , in order to allow properly for the _ excluded volume _ interactions between bonded monomers , we take the bond potential as a sum of @xmath29 _ and _ the so called weeks - chandler - anderson ( wca ) potential , @xmath30 , ( i.e. , the shifted and truncated repulsive branch of the lennard - jones potential ) ; @xmath31 \\theta(2^{1/6 } \\sigma - r))\\ ] ] with @xmath32 for @xmath33 or @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the non - bonded interactions between monomers are also taken into account by means of the wca potential , eq .",
    "( [ wca_pot ] ) .",
    "thus the interactions in our model correspond to good solvent conditions .",
    "the length scale is set by the parameter @xmath36 whereby the monomer diameter @xmath37 .    in our md simulation",
    "we use a langevin equation , which describes the brownian motion of a set of interacting particles whereby the action of the solvent is split into slowly evolving viscous force and a rapidly fluctuating stochastic force : @xmath38 the random force which represents the incessant collisions of the monomers with the solvent molecules satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath39 .",
    "the friction coefficient @xmath40 of the langevin thermostat , used for equilibration , has been set at @xmath41 .",
    "the integration step is @xmath42 time units ( t.u . ) and time is measured in units of @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the mass of the beads , @xmath45 .",
    "we emphasize at this point that in our coarse - grained modeling no explicit solvent particles are included .",
    "backbone monomers ( blue ) and @xmath46 side chains ( red ) of length @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 and strength of adsorption @xmath49 .",
    "side chains which are too strongly squeezed by the neighbors are seen occasionally to get off the substrate in order to minimize free energy . ]",
    "two side chains of length @xmath1 are tethered to _ each _ repeatable unit of the backbone except for the terminal beads of the polymer backbone where a single side chains is anchored only .",
    "thus the total number of monomers in the bottle - brush macromolecule is @xmath50 .",
    "because of the high grafting density , we use rather short side chains @xmath51 in our simulations - fig .",
    "[ snap_n20s3 ] .    for the bonded interaction in the side chains",
    "we take the frequently used kremer - grest potential , @xmath52 , with the so - called finitely - extensible non - linear elastic ( fene ) potential , @xmath53.\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ fene ] ) @xmath54 , so that the total potential @xmath55 has a minimum at bond length @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the bonded interaction , @xmath55 , makes the bonds of the side chains in our model unbreakable whereas those of the backbone may and do undergo scission .    the substrate in the present study is considered simply as a structureless adsorbing plane , with a lennard - jones potential acting with strength @xmath57 in the perpendicular @xmath58direction . in our simulations we consider as a rule the case of _ strong _ adsorption , @xmath59 .",
    "we start the simulation with a well equilibrated conformation of the chain and examine the thermal scission of the bonds .",
    "we measure the mean life time @xmath60 until the first bond rupture occurs , and average these times over more than @xmath61 events so as to determine the mean @xmath2 which is also referred to as mean first breakage time ( mfbt ) .",
    "in the course of the simulation we also sample the probability distribution of bond breaking regarding their position in the chain ( a rupture probability histogram ) , the probability distribution of the first breakage time , @xmath60 , as well as other quantities of interest . at periodic intervals",
    "we analyze the length distribution of backbone fragments and establish the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of fragment sizes , @xmath62 , which also yields the time evolution of the mean fragment length @xmath6 .",
    "since in the problem of thermal degradation there is no external force acting on the chain ends , a well defined activation barrier for a bond scission is actually missing , in contrast to the case of applied tensile force .",
    "therefore , a definition of an unambiguous criterion for bond breakage is not self - evident .",
    "moreover , depending on the degree of stretching , bonds may break and then recombine again .",
    "therefore , in our numeric experiments we use a sufficiently large expansion of the bond , @xmath63 , as a threshold to a broken state of the bond .",
    "this convention is based on our checks that the probability for recombination of bonds , stretched beyond @xmath64 , is sufficiently small .",
    "we have checked typical properties of the strongly adsorbed brush molecules as the variation of the mean radius of gyration @xmath65 and the mean end - to - end distance between terminal points on the polymer backbone , @xmath66 , for several lengths of the side chains , @xmath1 - see fig .",

    "the same applies for the mean bond length @xmath69 between segments along the backbone as function of @xmath1 .",

    "this effect persists and is even enhanced as the contour length @xmath0 gets larger - fig .",
    "[ histo]b .",
    "occasionally , some additional maxima show up in longer molecules , @xmath79 , which are then found to disappear with improved statistics .",
    "we have tracked down these temporal maxima in the scission probabilities as corresponding to local bends and kinks in the contour which , owing to mutual squeezing or rarefaction , strongly change the side chains mobility and , presumably , the induced tension . since conformations of adsorbed long molecules change rather slowly , a very large number of simulation runs is needed before such spurious maxima disappear .    evidently , with growing length @xmath1 of the side chains the minimum gets deeper and broader , indicating that breakage happens most frequently in bonds which are very close to the terminal bonds of the backbone . given the high density of grafting",
    ", one may interpret this effect as a consequence of the mutual immobilization and blocking of the side chains which are placed in the middle . in comparison ,",
    "side chains that are closer to the ends of the polymer backbone still have sufficient freedom to move and , therefore , contribute locally to stronger tension in the vicinity of both ends of the backbone .",
    "side chains of length @xmath78 , on the other hand , are too short to block one another",

    "this suggests a gradual crossover from a predominantly individual to a more concerted mechanism of bond scission . in adsorbed bottle - brush molecules",
