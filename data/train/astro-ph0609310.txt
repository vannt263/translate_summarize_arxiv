    "these are the hints of high mass ( hm ) zero age main sequence ( zams ) stars or young stellar objects ( ysos ) . however , extremely high absorption toward the cloud center ( @xmath5 , @xmath6= a few 100 ) prevents to detect any stars in optical or even in the infrared bands . @xcite",

    "the x - ray fluxes and spectra indicate that these are likely hm ysos .",
    "since hm stars evolve very rapidly and finally undergo supernova explosions , it will be reasonable to expect young snrs near the sgr b2 cloud . in facts , @xcite have discovered a peculiar snr candidate with chandra .",

    "this paper reports the first results of the suzaku observation .",
    "the sgr b region was observed with the xis on 10 - 12 october 2005 .",

    "the xis observation was made with the normal mode .",
    "the effective exposure time after removing the epoch of low earth elevation angle ( elv @xmath95@xmath10 ) and the south atlantic anomaly was about 89  ksec .      in a quick look of the spectrum , we found strong lines at @xmath26.7  kev and @xmath26.4  kev , in everywhere in the ccd imaging area ( ia ) , which may be due to the largely extended galactic center diffuse x - ray emission ( gcdx ) .",
    "these lines are most likely k@xmath0 lines of fe ( 6.7  kev ) and fe ( 6.4  kev ) .",
    "using the center energies of the two strong lines , we made fine correction of the cti ( charge transfer inefficiency ) , and fine gain tuning in xis - to - xis and segment - to - segment levels ( relative gain tuning ) .",
    "then the absolute gain tuning is made using the @xmath11fe calibration sources irradiating the ccd corners .",
    "details of this procedure and high capability are demonstrated in koyama et al .",

    "the diffuse enhancement in the northwest corresponds to the sgr b2 complex .",
    "other than this , we found two point sources at the southeast edge of the xis field of view ( fov ) .",

    "2002 , sakano et al .",
    "2004 , park et al .",
    "2005 , koyama et al .",
    "thus g0.61 + 0.01 is likely an ejecta dominant central region of an snr .",
    "we note that sgr a east has low temperature component of about 1 kev , while not in g0.61 + 0.01 .",
    "the absence of softer plasma may be due to the large absorption .",
    "the @xmath26 value of @xmath51  h  @xmath23 is larger than that of typical value to the gc ( @xmath52  h  @xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , g0.61 + 0.01 would be located behind or in the rim of the sgr b2 cloud .",
    "since g0.61 + 0.01 is located in the south of an expanding radio shell @xcite , which is probably interacting with the sgr b2 cloud rim , we assume that the distance of g0.61 + 0.01 is the same as sgr b2 and to be 8.5  kpc @xcite .",
    "then the 210 kev band luminosity is estimated to be @xmath53 ergs  s@xmath24 , which is typical for an ejecta plasma of an snr .",
    "the size of g0.61 + 0.01 ( the solid ellipse in figure [ fig : sgrb-6700img ] ) is  2.2@xmath544.8@xmath55 , which corresponds to  5.5 pc  @xmath56  12 pc at a distance of 8.5 kpc . assuming the plasma emission is due to a uniform density ellipsoid with the 3-axis radii of 2.7 pc , 2.7 pc and 6 pc , we estimate physical parameters of g0.61@xmath570.01 ( table [ tab : g_physpar ] ) .",
    "although the iron abundance is 3 - 4 times of the solar , total number and mass of protons are fur larger than those of irons .",
    "we therefore assume that electron density ( @xmath58 ) is equal to the proton density ( @xmath59 ) , and that protons carry most of the plasma mass ( @xmath60 ) . dividing the radius of the major axis ( 6 pc ) by the sound velocity of the 3.2  kev plasma ( @xmath6110@xmath62 cm  s@xmath24 )",
    ", we obtain the dynamical time scale ( @xmath63 ) of @xmath24@xmath3 years .",
    "if , instead , we use the ionization parameter ( @xmath31 ) and electron density ( @xmath58 ) , then the ionization time scale ( @xmath64 ) is estimated to be @xmath65 years . since the source size of  2.2@xmath544.8@xmath55 is comparable to that of the half power diameter ( @xmath66 ) , the real size of g0.61 + 0.01 must be smaller .",
    "therefore the quoted value of @xmath6710@xmath68 years should be an upper limit , while that of @xmath6910@xmath68 years is a lower limit , because @xmath58 is inversely proportional to the root square of the plasma volume .",
    "thus the age of g0.61 + 0.01 is probably around several@xmath5610@xmath68 years .",
    "another possibility is that g0.61 + 0.01 comprises a part of a larger snr .",
    "since g0.61 + 0.01 is found at the edge of the xis field , other parts of a candidate snr may be out of the xis field . in this scenario , g0.61 + 0.01 may be a part of the expanding radio shell discovered by @xcite .",
