    "in the recent studies of the solar rotation , the tracer methods were extensively used for the determination . the features like sunspots , plages , filaments , faculae , bright points , super granules , coronal holes , giant cells , etc .",
    "were found to rotate with the sun @xcite . by tracing the passage of any of these features over the solar disc , one can estimate the rotation as well as its differential nature with respect to height and latitude .",
    "in general , the equatorial region rotates faster than the polar - region .",
    "the solar coronal rotation is a comparatively less understood phenomenon because the coronal features are less prominent in both the time duration and spatial extent .",
    "the observations are affected by the fact that the solar corona is optically thin across a wide range of observed radio frequencies .",
    "recent studies of the solar radio emission provided a lot of information concerning the solar corona @xcite .",
    "the radio observations have the advantage of permitting one to attain resolution for the heights in the corona as the propagation of radio waves distinctly depends on the plasma density in the corona .",
    "by using radio flux data at different frequencies @xcite , it has been shown earlier that the coronal rotation depends on the heights in the corona .",
    "several groups have reported from time to time that the solar corona rotates differentially , with respect to latitude , in the same way as the photosphere and the chromosphere .",
    "the analysis of x - ray bright points ( xbps ) in _",
    "soho_/eit images @xcite , and recent analysis of xbps in _ hinode_/xrt and _",
    "yohkoh_/sxt images @xcite also asserts the coronal differential rotation",
    ". however , in contrast to these references , @xcite and @xcite studied the rotation rate of corona by using _ yohkoh_/sxt data and showed that the soft x - ray corona does not exhibit any significant differential rotation , _",
    "i.e. _ the corona rotates more rigidly than the chromosphere and the photosphere .",
    "recently , by making use of xbps observed with the _",
    "yohkoh_/sxt , @xcite found that the rate of differential rotation changes with a parameter @xmath0 which is linked with the lifetime of xbps .",
    "the long - lived xbps follows the rotation rate of the photospheric magnetic field , whereas , the short - lived xbps approaches to that evaluated from the photospheric doppler measurements .",
    "@xcite compared differential rotation of subphotospheric layers derived from gong++ dopplergrams with the small bright coronal structure ( sbcs ) observed through _",
    "soho_/eit for the period correspond to the decling phase of solar cycle 23 .",
    "they reported that the sbcs rotate faster than the upper subphotospheric layer ( 3 mm ) by about 0.5 deg / day at the equator .",
    "the latitude gradient of the rotation rate of the sbcs and the subphotospheric layers were found to be very similar .",
    "the comparison of the data of the solar magnetic elements reveal that the differential rotation of the compact magnetic elements with negative and positive polarities have similar behavior for the solar cycles 20 and 21 @xcite .",
    "it is also established that some variations in the rotation rate of compact magnetic elements were present at the time of polarity reversal of the sun .",
    "the differential rotation of the solar corona is , therefore , still an open subject and further studies are required to establish the coronal differential rotation . here",
    "we report the study of the coronal rotation using nobeyama radioheliograph ( _ norh _ ) .",
    "the nobeyama radioheliographs at 17 ghz consist of an array of eighty four antennas aligned in the t - shaped configuration .",
    "this is dedicated only for the solar observations .",
    "high speed processing of signals from all antennas generates full disc radio images of the sun , at the maximum rate of 20 images per second .",
    "the sun is observed for 8 hours per day .",
    "the radioheliograph provides unprecedented uniform sampling of sfd images with high spatial and temporal resolutions of 10 arcsec and 50 msec , respectively @xcite .",
    "the observations are possible throughout the year without any interruption by weather conditions .",
    "the radio images seem to discriminate low - contrast or faint structures on the solar disk _",
    "e.g. _ dark filaments , bright points , coronal holes , and other large - scale structures .    here",
    ", we analyze the solar full disk images obtained from nobeyama radioheliograph ( _ norh _ ) at 17 ghz .",
    "each image is of 512 x 512 pixel in size .",
    "the principal technique of our investigation is to calculate the autocorrelation coefficient of the intensity variation for a set of latitude bins selected on the _ norh _ images . for this",
    "we utilize one _ norh _ full disk image per day on which latitude bins , or strips , are chosen .",
    "the dimensions of these rectangular bins are just two pixels in width and the length is such as to incorporate the entire pixels on the solar disc image at each latitude .",
    "the strips are selected at every 10latitude    for each latitude , a time series of the radio intensity is generated from the average of the selected pixels values in the strip . to determine rotation period , we obtained autocorrelation coefficient using the standard subroutines of idl software . the period estimation is a straightforward identification of any dominating periodically varying signal present in the coronal radio emission .",
    ".the coefficient @xmath1 & @xmath2 obtained from nobeyama radioheliograph ( norh ) at 17 ghz for the years 1999 - 2000 .",

    "the estimated sidereal rotation period has been plotted as a function of the latitude for the years 1999 - 2001 , separately .",
    "figures  2   4 represent the differential rotation profiles of each year . in spite of scatter in the data points ,",
    "the solar differential rotation is clearly evident .",
    "we obtained the coefficient @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the solar coronal rotation for each year separately .",
    "these are tabulated in table  1 .",
    "the mean of these has been compared with the results obtained through the analysis of _",
    "yohkoh_/sxt xbps @xcite and _ soho_/eit cbps data @xcite .    the sidereal equatorial rate ( coefficient @xmath1 , in table  2 ) in the case of _ norh _ is found to be 4.4 % higher than the _ hinode_/xrt xbps ( 14.2 deg / day ) and 15.8 % lower than the _ yohkoh_/sxt xbps data ( 17.6 deg / day ) , on average .",
    "coefficient @xmath1 of the present work is found to be comparable with the sunspot data ( 14.6 deg / day ) and _ soho_/eit cbps data ( 14.7 deg / day ) .",
    "the differential rate represented by coefficient @xmath2 is found to be significantly lower then the values obtained by @xcite using _",
    "hinode_/xrt xbps data ( 49.4 % ) & _ yohkoh_/sxt xbps data ( 53.1 % ) , @xcite using _",
    "soho_/eit cbps data ( 31.3 % ) and @xcite using photospheric sunspots data ( 25.8 % ) .",
    "it means the latitude gradient of the coronal rotation rate is much lower at 17 ghz radio frequency in comparison to that obtained from the observations of x - ray and euv frequencies .    from the analysis of radio flux at 2.8 ghz",
    ", @xcite could not find any systematic relationship between coronal rotation period and phases of solar cycle .",
    "our results show comparatively faster equatorial rotation in the year 2000 , than those of 1999 and 2001 .",
    "thus , it may have some relation with the maxima of the solar activity in the 23d cycle .",
    "the sunspot numbers in 1999 and 2001 are relatively lower than 2000 .",
    "the estimated coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 from the nobeyama radioheliogram show a temporal variability .",
    "the temporal variations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and sunspot numbers are shown in figure  5 .",
    "our results for coefficient @xmath1 are more in agreement with the results derived from the sunspot region at the photospheric @xcite and at the chromospheric level @xcite . since _",
    "yohkoh_/sxt observed the soft x - ray emission of the corona and was not a coronograph , the portion of corona that was imaged through this sxt range from the photosphere to a height of approximately 0.5 @xmath3 ( david mckanzie , private communication 2009 ) . whereas , the radio emissions at 17 ghz originate approximately at the altitude of @xmath4 km above the photosphere .",
    "the height is adopted from @xcite , wherein the enhanced electron density model by @xcite was used to estimate the average altitude .",
    "thus 17 ghz seems to originate almost at the interface of the chromosphere and the corona , hence , the equatorial rotation rate matches more with the photospheric or the chromospheric data rather than the coronal data .",
    "the analysis of daily solar full disc radio images at 17 ghz for the years 1999 to 2001 shows that the coronal equatorial rotation rate is higher than those obtained by xbps and quite lower than those obtained by cbps @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath2 shows that the corona does rotate differentially as in the photosphere and chromosphere ; but the gradient is lower ( @xmath5 25.8% and @xmath531.3% , respectively ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the results obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the difference in the rotation profiles of soft x - ray emission and 17 ghz could possibly be due to their different regions of origin in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 are also compared with the annual sunspot numbers ( see table  1 ) .",
    "this gives evidence of the dependence of coronal rotation on the phases of solar cycle .",
    "figure  5 shows that the coronal equatorial rotation ( @xmath1 ) is in phase with the annual sunspot number , whereas its latitude dependent differential gradient is anti - phase to the annual sunspot number .",
    "a long term study is indeed required to ascertain this correlation more clearly .",
    "the authors wish to acknowledge the data ( radio images at 17 ghz & annual sunspot numbers ) used in the present work .",
