    "structures composed of two closely spaced quantum dots ( qds ) attract much attention motivated by their rich physical properties as well as by possible applications in nanoelectronics or quantum computing . a major factor that determines the properties of such",
    "a system is the electronic coupling between the dots . for closely spaced dots",
    ", the system spectrum can be strongly affected by tunnel coupling @xcite .",
    "optical spectra of closely spaced structures indeed show clear manifestations of such tunneling - related effects @xcite . due to strong delocalization of carrier states over the double dot structure , analogous to a chemical covalent bond ,",
    "such structures are often referred to as quantum dot molecules ( qdms ) or artificial molecules .",
    "the properties of such artificial molecules are also affected by phonon - related processes which are inevitable in a crystal environment .",
    "such effects will limit the feasibility of building qdm - based quantum - coherent devices by providing a dephasing channel for both charge @xcite and spin @xcite states . depending on the form and localization character of the wave functions",
    ", such phonon - assisted transitions may either take place between two delocalized states or involve charge redistribution when an electron dissipatively tunnels to a different dot . in the latter case",
    ", the electron spin can be conserved @xcite , which can be used to control the spin state of a magnetic impurity in one of the qds @xcite .",
    "dissipative tunneling is also interesting in a two - electron configuration , where a transition to a doubly occupied state is only possible in a singlet configuration .",
    "this discrimination leads , on one hand , to pure dephasing of singlet - triplet superpositions @xcite but , on the other hand , might be used to speed up the proposed singlet - triplet measurement protocols @xcite .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", dissipative carrier transfer in self - assembled structures has been studied with optical spectroscopy methods ( time - integrated and time - resolved photoluminescence , and photoluminescence excitation experiments ) both in lateral double - dot systems @xcite as well as in stacked qdms @xcite and qd chains ( both stacked and lateral ) @xcite .",
    "various mechanisms have been invoked to account for the observed properties . in most cases ,",
    "the kinetics is attributed to tunneling @xcite . in some other experiments @xcite , signatures of radiative ( frster - like ) transfer have been observed .",
    "coulomb scattering @xcite and thermally activated processes @xcite also seem to play an important role , at least in some systems .",
    "the variety of investigated structures and probable transfer mechanisms is reflected in a relatively wide distribution of measured transfer times .",
    "while the transfer in general takes place on time scales shorter or comparable with the exciton life time ( which is necessary for the process to be observable in an optical experiment ) , the observed times range from tens of picoseconds @xcite to several nanoseconds @xcite . in most cases , however , transfer times between hundreds of picoseconds and a few nanoseconds are observed .",
    "this experimental situation indicates that carrier kinetics in coupled qd structures is a rich and complex problem which most likely can not be solved by proposing a unique , universal theory .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to undertake a systematic theoretical study of various carrier transfer processes and to identify conditions in which one or another mechanism is expected to dominate the system properties .",
    "such a theoretical analysis of individual transfer mechanisms has in fact already started with several works devoted to electron tunneling ( in simplified confinement models ) @xcite and some studies of the frster - like transfer @xcite .    in this paper",

    ". a reliable calculation of tunneling rates requires reasonably precise knowledge of the electron wave functions . for a strained self - assembled structure presently under consideration , this implies the need to calculate the strain and then to find the single particle wave functions , e.g. , by a @xmath1 method .",

    "the only difference is that in the single electron case it tunnels towards an empty qd , whereas in the two electron case , there is already another electron .",
    "this basically leads to shifts ( due to coulomb interaction ) of the parameter regimes where the relaxation is most efficient from the region of identical dots to the asymmetric situation where the difference of confinement energies compensates for the coulomb repulsion .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached in the case of gated qdm structures modeled by gaussian potential wells @xcite .",
    "we have studied phonon - assisted relaxation ( thermalization ) for single - electron and two - electron configurations in self - assembled quantum dots . in order to describe the electron states in a strained structure in a possibly realistic ( but still relatively simple ) way and to reliably model the effect of the system geometry we have developed a generalized , multi - component envelope function formalism based on the variational principle .",
    "our results show that the single phonon relaxation is very efficient in an extremely narrow range of relative qd sizes near the anticrossings of energy levels but only for systems with a sufficiently large inter - dot distance ( several nm ) . in this case",
    ", the relaxation times can be as low as 1  ps , both in the single - electron and two - electron cases .",
    "the range of efficient relaxation becomes narrower as the dots are more distant from each other . both coupling channels , piezoelectric and deformation potential , are important for the overall relaxation rate .",
    "the former dominates at low ( sub - mev ) transition energies .",
    "when the distance between the dots becomes smaller than about 10  nm , the energy level splitting becomes too large to be spanned by a single acoustic phonon ( but still to small for an optical one ) . in this range of closely stacked dots ,",
    "the tunneling times increase by orders of magnitudes and take values in the nanosecond range .",
    "for such small inter - dot distances , the energy splitting between the two lowest states is dominated by tunnel coupling and depends weakly on the size difference . as a result ,",
    "the efficiency of the relaxation process remains nearly constant over a wide range of dot sizes .",
    "one can expect , however , that two - phonon processes @xcite can be important in this range of parameters , in particular for energy splittings exceeding the optical phonon energy . in general , decoherence in such systems may be dominated by pure dephasing due to occupation - conserving phonon scattering @xcite .",
    "our findings seem to be consistent with the general features of experimental observations .",
    "the size range where the relaxation is very efficient ( on picosecond time scales ) is extremely narrow and does not exceed a few angstrom , which is comparable to the lattice constant of gaas .",
    "this means that such an efficient relaxation between the two lowest states in self - assembled quantum dot molecules is a rather rare phenomenon which occurs only for very finely tuned ( accidentally or intentionally ) dots and is unlikely to be observed in a typical sample .",
    "therefore , we conclude that relaxation times on the order of at least hundreds of picoseconds should be typical .",
    "the coupling between the dots decreases exponentially with the distance between them which reduces the overlap between the wave functions .",
    "therefore , phonon - assisted tunneling for a spontaneously formed pair of non - identical dots should become inefficient as the spatial separation between between the dots grows beyond a certain distance , as is indeed observed in experiments @xcite . in the case",
    "studied here , that is , single - phonon relaxation between states separated by a few mev in energy , the relaxation rates undergo oscillations as functions of the geometrical parameters due to a structured nature of the phonon reservoir and the resulting interference effects .",
    "one should note , however , that most of the available experimental data correspond to systems which much larger energy splittings .",
    "a more quantitative comparison is possible in the case of the measurements presented in ref .  . here , electron tunneling ( that is , a transition between spatially direct and indirect exciton states ) has been studied for a qdm with a fixed 10  nm spacing and energy level difference of a few mev , which corresponds more closely to the physical situation of our model .",
    "our calculations for such parameter range yield transfer times in the range of hundreds of picoseconds , which reasonably agrees with the measured time of 0.5  ns ( note that a slightly different material system was used in that experiment and that some details of the system geometry are not exactly known )",
