    "extensive gravitational evidence suggests that a dominant fraction of the matter in our galaxy is nonluminous , or _",
    "dark_. although the identity of this dark matter is currently unknown , it may consist of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "numerous experiments aimed at the direct detection of these wimps are currently being developed .",
    "these experiments generically measure the nuclear recoil energy deposited in a detector when an incident wimp interacts with a nucleus in the detector .",
    "an important signature of halo dark matter in direct - detection experiments is the annual modulation induced by the earth s motion with respect to the halo @xcite . in the standard model of the dark halo , in which the velocity distribution of the wimps is a maxwellian distribution truncated at the escape speed of the galaxy , the modulation of the wimp interaction rate at high nuclear recoil energies is in phase with the motion of the earth with respect to the halo , peaking when the relative speed is maximal ( june ) and reaching a minimum when the relative motion is minimal ( december ) . for low energy recoils",
    ", however , it is well known that that the interaction rate experiences a phase reversal , peaking in december @xcite .",
    "this phase reversal occurs below a particular _ crossover recoil energy _ , @xmath1 .",
    "in this paper we examine what information about the mass of the wimp can be obtained from this phase reversal .",
    "we emphasize that this phase reversal could constitute an important signature of a wimp flux , and we also point out that because the crossover recoil energy is a function of the wimp mass , the observation of the phase of annual modulation immediately places an upper limit on the allowed wimp mass .",
    "furthermore , if wimp direct detection experiments with sufficient energy resolution determine the crossover energy @xmath1 , the wimp mass could be independently measured using only observations of the phase of the annual modulation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly review the basics of wimp direct detection experiments and the isothermal model of the dark halo . in section 3",
    ", we explore the dependence of the annual modulation on energy recoil , and revisit the phase reversal that occurs at low recoil energies .",
    "finally , we demonstrate how this observation may be exploited to place limits on the wimp mass and to obtain estimates of the mass directly .",
    "we emphasize that observation of this phase reversal will constitute an unambiguous signature of an extraterrestrial wimp flux .",
    "more than twenty collaborations worldwide are presently developing detectors designed to search for wimps . although the experiments employ a variety of different methods , the basic idea underlying wimp direct detection is straightforward : the experiments seek to measure the energy deposited when a wimp interacts with a nucleus in the detector @xcite .",
    "if a wimp of mass @xmath2 scatters elastically from a nucleus of mass @xmath3 , it will deposit a recoil energy of @xmath4 , where    @xmath5    is the reduced mass , @xmath6 is the speed of the wimp relative to the nucleus , and @xmath7 is the scattering angle in the center of mass frame",
    ". we may compute ( following , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) the differential detection rate , per unit detector mass ( _ i.e. _ , counts / day / kg detector / kev recoil energy ) associated with this process ,    @xmath8    where @xmath9 gev/@xmath10/c@xmath11 is the halo wimp density , @xmath12 is the total nucleus - wimp interaction cross section and @xmath13 is the nuclear form factor for the wimp - nucleus interaction that describes how the effective cross section varies with wimp - nucleus energy transfer .",
    "we consider here only spin independent interactions , wherein the target nucleus can be approximated as a sphere of uniform density smoothed by a gaussian @xcite , and the resulting form factor is ,    @xmath14 } { q^3 r_1 ^ 3 } \\ , e^{-q^2s^2/2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 , @xmath16 fm , and ,    @xmath17 \\times 10^{-13 } { \\rm cm}\\ ] ]    is the radius of the nucleus . for spin - dependent interactions ,",

    "@xmath24 here @xmath25 is the total angular momentum of the nucleus and @xmath26 is determined by the expectation value of the spin content of the nucleus ( see @xcite ) .    for the estimates necessary in this paper",
    ", we take the wimp - nucleon cross section @xmath27 cm@xmath11 , and take the total wimp - nucleus cross section to be so that the following equation results from eq.([eq : scalar ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath29 where the @xmath30 is the proton - wimp reduced mass , and a is the atomic mass of the target nucleus .",
    "information about halo structure is encoded into the quantity @xmath31 ,    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the distribution of wimp speeds relative to the detector , and where @xmath34 represents the minimum velocity that can result in a recoil energy q. to determine @xmath31 , we must have a model for the velocity structure of the halo .",
    "in what follows we will consider dark matter detection experiments without directional capabilities ; such experiments are sensitive only to the wimp flux integrated over the entire sky .",
    "the most frequently employed background velocity distribution is that of a simple isothermal sphere .",
    "in such a model , the galactic wimp speeds with respect to the halo obey a maxwellian distribution with a velocity dispersion @xmath35 ,    @xmath36    where @xmath6 is the wimp velocity relative to the galactic halo , and where we have performed an angular integration over the entire sky .",
    "we take the velocity dispersion of our local halo to be @xmath37 km / s .",
    "this is the local velocity distribution ; it is expected to vary with spatial position throughout the galaxy .",
    "as pointed out by drukier , freese , and spergel @xcite , and studied ( in the context of an isothermal halo ) by freese , frieman , and gould @xcite , earth - bound observers of the dark halo will see a different , time dependent velocity distribution as a result of the relative motion of the earth with respect to the galaxy . to take this into account",
    ", we estimate the velocity of the earth with respect to the galactic halo .",
    "neglecting the ellipticity of the earth s orbit and the non - uniform motion of the sun in right ascension , we may write the speed of the earth with respect to the the dark wimp halo as    @xmath38    where the phase @xmath39 corresponds to june 2nd @xmath40 1.3 days ( relative to @xmath41 on january 1 ) .",
    "the speed of the earth with respect to the sun is @xmath42 km / s , and the speed of the sun with respect to the halo is @xmath43 km / s .",
    "more precise expressions for the motion of the earth and sun may be found in @xcite .",

    "for the case of an isothermal halo , one generally expects that , above a critical recoil energy , the annual modulation will be in phase with the motion of the earth with respect to the halo , peaking near june 2nd . in the following section",
    ", we will demonstrate the dependence of the phase of the modulation on the observed recoil energy .",

    "at best , for wimp masses near 400 gev , the experiment requires @xmath99 kg - yrs of exposure . with its current mass",

    "for the most optimistic wimp masses , dama would require nearly 1000 kg - yrs of exposure to observe the wimp phase reversal .",
    "liquid xenon experiments that are currently underway , such as the 40 kg zeplin - ii , will be sensitive to the phase reversal @xcite . with a recoil energy threshold of 10 kev , the zeplin - ii experiment will require only 40 kg - yrs of exposure for wimp masses near 150 gev .",

    "hence , such experiments could observe a phase reversal with as little as a year of continuous runtime .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2n ] , a disadvantage of xenon based detectors is that the minimum required exposure is low only for a narrow span of wimp masses . outside of the 100 - 200 gev mass range ,",
    "the required exposure rapidly becomes larger .",
    "the other detectors , particularly cresst - ii and genius - tf , have flatter curves , _ i.e. _ , the minimum required exposure does not change rapidly as a function of wimp mass . however , future 1 tonne xenon detectors , such as the xenon and zeplin - iv experiments , will have the advantage of sheer size , so that they may reach the required exposures on reasonable timescales .",
    "the reversal of phase at low recoil energy constitutes an unambiguous signature of an incident wimp flux .",
    "the usual annual modulation , while an important indicator of a wimp halo , could conceivably be mimicked by earth bound physics ( such as annually modulated temperature fluctuations in the detector ) .",
    "it is difficult , however , to imagine non - wimp scenarios that could engender a phase reversal only at low energy recoils .",
    "in addition , the critical recoil energy depends in a well understood way on the wimp mass , so that an independent estimation of the wimp mass can be obtained by locating the critical recoil energy , @xmath1 , below which the phase reversal is observed .",
    "furthermore , because the crossover recoil energy is a monotonically increasing function of the wimp mass , the observation of an annual modulation in the wimp signal will necessarily imply an upper limit to the wimp mass .",
    "if a june - peaking annual modulation were observed in the lowest accessible energy recoil bins of the dama , cdms - ii , cresst - ii , edelweiss - ii , genius - tf , zeplin - ii or xenon / zeplin - iv detectors , one could immediately place upper bounds on the wimp mass of [ 103 , 48 , 6 , 97 , 10 , 52 , 29 ] gev , respectively , provided the experiments have sufficient exposure to observe the annual modulation at all .",
    "the observation of a phase reversal would provide independent confirmation of the wimp mass .",
    "the cawo@xmath72 based detectors of cresst - ii have the lowest required exposure , on the order of 10 kg - yrs , and would require only 2 years of running time to observe the phase reversal . with 40 kg of detector , genius - tf and zeplin - ii could observe the phase reversal with as little as a year of runtime .",
    "we note that the 1000 kg xenon based detectors , zeplin - iv and xenon , operating with recoil energy thresholds on the order of a few kev provide an excellent means of detecting the phase reversal in the differential rate for wimp masses on the order of 100 gev , requiring only 1 year of running time .",
    "hence , should the annual modulation be observed , its phase reversal will provide a means to obtain the wimp mass in these detectors .",
    "the analysis of this paper has assumed an isothermal halo model .",
    "galaxies , however , are thought to form hierarchically , with small substructures condensing first and subsequently merging into progressively larger structures .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to think that the dark halo of our galaxy may be populated with clumps or streams of dark matter .",
    "indeed , work by stiff , widrow , and frieman @xcite suggests that there is a high ( @xmath101 ) probability that residual substructure exists at the solar radius , with a contribution that is an additional few percent of the local halo density .",
    "in fact , as discussed by @xcite , the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , which is being tidally disrupted by the milky way , is pouring dark matter down upon the solar neighborhood , at the level of an additional ( 0.3 - 25)% of the local halo density .",
    "the peak of the annual modulation and value of the crossover recoil energy will differ in halo models containing substantial clumps or streams of dark matter , or characterized by anisotropic velocity distributions @xcite . in these alternate halo models ,",
    "the phase and amplitude of the annual modulation are generically altered , and the impact on the crossover recoil energy must therefore be computed on a case by case basis",
