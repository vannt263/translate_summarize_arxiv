    "it is known that quantum coherent effects can survive for relatively long times in biological systems , even at ambient conditions and for strong interactions ( large reconstruction energy ) between the system and the protein - solvent environment it is embedded in @xcite . in particular , in photosynthetic organisms the energy ( exciton ) transfer ( et ) between light - sensitive molecules ( chlorophylls and carotenoids ) is accompanied by quantum coherent effects which reveal themselves in a relatively slow decoherence , i.e. , a slow decay of the non - diagonal elements of the reduced system density matrix in the diagonal representation of the system hamiltonian .",
    "typical decoherence time scales are @xmath0 fs and there are many explanations for this quantum `` memory '' effect in bio - systems @xcite . in some situations , especially for energy conserving interactions where the dimer energy is not changed during the dynamics , we do not have true decoherence at all , but only partial decoherence takes place , meaning that the non - diagonal density matrix elements do not decay to zero for large times @xcite . the standard theory to analyze decoherence",
    "is the theory of open quantum systems , which are systems ( dimer ) which interact with environments ( protein - solvent ) . in the theory of open quantum systems ,",
    "it is most commonly assumed that the environment is in a _",
    "mixed quantum state _ , given by a density matrix ( and not a wave function , which would represent a pure state ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , traditionally , environments are usually considered to be in , or close to , thermal equilibrium ( the gibbs state ) which is a mixed state given by a density matrix that is diagonal in the environment energy basis and has thus no coherence @xcite .",
    "this description of the system - environment complex is thus not purely of quantum nature .",
    "moreover , there are many arguments indicating that protein - solvent environments may not actually be in equilibrium , but rather in states including noisy and non - equilibrium components @xcite . in particular , it is argued in @xcite that the temperature of a plant leaf containing the light harvesting complexes can differ from the temperature of its environment",
    "actually , it is not even clear that the concept of  temperature \" can be introduced in this case .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the quantum coherent properties of bio - systems embedded in protein - solvent environments when _ both the bio - system and its environment are initially prepared in a pure quantum state _",
    "( in particular , not in equilibrium ) .    due to decoherence caused by the interaction with its environment ,",
    "an initially pure system state becomes mixed , hence ` more classical ' @xcite .",
    "this loss of purity ( or , ` quantumness ' ) is mediated by quantum correlations , called entanglement , between the system and its environment . a good measure for it turns out to be the so - called entanglement entropy ( ee ) .",
    "first introduced in @xcite , the examination of ee is receiving enormous attention from researches in different fields of science , ranging from solid state physics and the theory of quantum computation and information to quantum field- and black hole theory @xcite ( see also references therein ) .    * goals , general setup . *",
    "the main goal of our current paper is to introduce and examine the notion of ee for biological systems and to elucidate precisely its relation to decoherence . to be concrete",
    ", we consider a dimer based on two chlorophyll molecules , chl@xmath1 ( donor ) and chl@xmath2 ( acceptor ) , embedded in a protein - solvent environment , see figure 1 .",
    "the dimer is described by a two - level system representing the two excited energy levels of the chlorophyll molecules .",
    "the ground states of the chlorophylls are not included in the description , as it is assumed that the time of the excitation transfer between the two excited levels is much shorter than either of the time of fluorescence and the time of decay of the exciton to the environment @xcite .",
    "initially , the chlorophyll dimer is excited by the absorption of a photon from the sun , so the initial dimer state is a pure state ( possibly a superposition of chl@xmath2 and chl@xmath1 excitations ) .",
    "as motivated above and contrary to previous considerations @xcite , we assume here that the protein - solvent environment is initially in a pure state as well , and not in equilibrium ( or any other mixed state ) . for concreteness , we consider that the environment is represented by a collection of non - interacting harmonic oscillators ( modeling atomic vibrational modes ) which are initially in coherent states .",
    "the total system is then described by a wave function , i.e. , a pure state .",
    "the interaction between the dimer and the environment is considered to be ( almost ) energy - conserving .",
    "corrections due to energy - exchange terms are estimated .",
    "we analyze the ee of the reservoir as well and we exhibit oscillator frequency domains corresponding to parts of the reservoir which contribute to the ee production , and others which do not . in this work",
    ", the interaction strength between the dimer and the environment is not assumed to be weak as compared to the dimer energy difference ( in fact , it can take arbitrary values ) .",

    "it is important that the state of the system @xmath9 be _ pure _ for the above equivalence to hold ; indeed if @xmath20 is the product of two mixed states , then the reduced state of @xmath14 , @xmath21 , is not pure .",
