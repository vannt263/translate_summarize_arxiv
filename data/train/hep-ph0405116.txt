    "experimentally , in _ pp _  and _ pp _  collisions , not only the average particle multiplicity is increasing with energy but , as well , the normalised width of the multiplicity distribution is an increasing function of energy @xcite . in other words , both @xmath2 and @xmath3 increase with energy .",
    "the increase of @xmath2 is expected : more particles are produced when more energy is available .",
    "the growth of @xmath4 is , however , not so obvious .",
    "the general argument seems to be that the increase of energy implies phase - space opening .",
    "there is more room for partons , strings , clusters or clans , more room for multiple collisions and different impact parameters contributions , more room for harder collisions and additional qcd branching @xcite . in all these approaches ,",
    "if there are no limitations , fluctuations increasingly dominate over average multiplicity : @xmath4 increases and , asymptotically , it may reach a constant value ( kno scaling @xcite ) .",
    "this kind of behaviour , as pointed out in @xcite , has been observed long ago in cosmic ray physics @xcite , with the negative binomial parameter @xmath5 stabilising at a value of the order of 2.53 , for @xmath6  tev .",
    "however , if saturation phenomena occur @xcite , i.e. , too many objects occupy a finite region of interaction , then fluctuations are severely limited and @xmath4 will start to decrease . on general grounds ,",
    "this is not unreasonable . as the number of intermediate objects ( or final particles )",
    "is bounded by @xmath7 ( conservation of energy ) , while the region of interaction is constrained by the stronger froissart bound , @xmath8 , there exists a real possibility for saturation .",
    "it is also well known that , at fixed energy , when triggering on rare events @xcite or selecting central impact parameter , @xmath9 , collisions @xcite , the kno distribution , due to the higher density , is narrower .",
    "we shall work in the framework of the dual string model @xcite .",
    "saturation , in this case , results from clustering and percolation of strings . in a collision , @xmath10 strings are produced and they may form clusters with different number of strings ( or different sizes ) .",
    "these clusters act as random , particle emitting , sources .",
    "following @xcite , we write for the multiplicity distribution , @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a normalised weight function , @xmath14 is a clustering variable , @xmath15 a convolution function for a cluster of strings , @xmath16 being the single string average multiplicity . we assume for @xmath15 a poisson distribution ,",
    "this being consistent with the single string distribution of low energy @xmath17annihilations .",
    "note that , as emphasised in @xcite , an equation similar to ( [ eq:1 ] ) , with the same function @xmath18 , can be written for the inclusive @xmath19 distribution , @xmath20 .    from ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath21 and @xmath22    defining now @xmath23 as the number of clusters , @xmath24 the number of strings in a cluster and @xmath25 the average number of strings , which must satisfy the sum rule @xmath26 , we shall write @xmath27 such that , finally , we obtain @xmath28 and @xmath29    the relevant parameter in string clustering ( and percolation ) is the transverse density @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the transverse radius of the string ( we shall use @xmath33 fm ) and @xmath34 is the effective radius of the interaction region , with @xmath35 fm in _",
    "_  collisions .",
    "it is the parameter @xmath30 that controls clustering : when @xmath24 strings cluster , the effective colour charge is not proportional to @xmath24 but , due to the vectorial nature of colour summation @xcite , is proportional to @xmath36 , where @xcite @xmath37 such that , instead of ( [ eq:8 ] ) , one should write @xmath38 equation ( [ eq:9 ] ) for @xmath0 remains , of course , unchanged .",
    "note that @xmath39 is a decreasing function of @xmath30 .",
    "in order to show , clearly , the problem of the competition between the opening of new possibilities and limitations due to saturation , let us introduce a very simple , and known to everybody , toy model .",
    "imagine that one has @xmath10 identical coins to distribute over @xmath40 identical boxes .",
    "the reader may imagine the distribution of @xmath10 partons or strings over the interaction region of size @xmath40 , or @xmath41 ( in units of @xmath42 ) .",
    "this is a purely combinatorial problem , without percolation .    what is the distribution of coins in the boxes ? in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that in the thermodynamical limit only the transverse density @xmath43 is relevant , and that the first moments of the distribution @xmath44 of the number of strings per cluster ( the probability of having a @xmath24-cluster ) @xmath45 and @xmath46    if we use this toy model as input for @xmath18 in ( [ eq:1 ] ) , and take , as mentioned before , the poisson distribution for @xmath47 , then , see ( [ eq:9 ] ) , one obtains @xmath48    in figure  [ fig:1 ] we present plots of ( [ eq : toy8 ] ) and ( [ eq : toy9 ] ) .",
    "the average multiplicity is , naturally , a growing function of the density .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 goes to infinity at small @xmath30 ( one just has 1-clusters ) , decreases and reaches a minimum , @xmath49 , at @xmath50 , then moves to infinity again as @xmath51 ( the distribution is dominated by @xmath52-clusters ) .",
    "we have checked by monte carlo simulation that the distribution @xmath44 of the model is similar to a gamma distribution .",
    "in order to make contact with real physics , we need to estimate the dependence of the parameter @xmath5 , experimentally measured in _ pp_collisions as a function of the energy , on the density parameter @xmath30 . in other words",
    ", we have to find the energy dependence of @xmath30 . as @xmath30 , see ( [ eq:10 ] ) , depends on @xmath10 and @xmath41 , we need to find the energy dependence of @xmath10 and @xmath41 .    for the _ pp _  average charged particle multiplicity in the dual string model , we shall write @xcite : @xmath53 ,        \\label{eq : phys12}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the single valence string average multiplicity ( assumed constant ) , @xmath55 the sea string multiplicity reduction factor ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "notice that in ( [ eq : phys12 ] ) one always has 2 valence strings and @xmath57 sea strings . at low energy ,",
    "@xmath58  gev , experimentally @xmath59 , and theoretically @xmath60 ( the two valence strings ) and of course @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "notice that ( [ eq : phys12 ] ) is a natural generalisation of ( [ eq:13 ] ) when there are two kinds of strings .    as the slope parameter @xmath63 is a direct measure of the square of the interaction radius @xmath64",
    ", we write , from ( [ eq:10 ] ) , @xmath65 with @xmath66 , such that at @xmath67  gev , @xmath35  fm and @xmath68 .    by using equations (",
    "[ eq : phys12 ] ) and ( [ eq : phys13 ] ) , and experimental information on @xmath69 @xcite and on @xmath63 @xcite , we can in principle construct @xmath70 and @xmath71 : from @xmath71 we obtain @xmath72 , eq .  ( [ eq : toy9 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a we show our fit to @xmath63 and in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b our fit to @xmath69 .",
    "these parameterisations are then used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phys13 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : phys12 ] ) .    intuitively , one expects the number of strings , @xmath10 , to increase with @xmath7 .",
    "the results from our fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] : @xmath10 increases with energy and , within a factor 2 , is not substantially different from monte carlo direct calculations @xcite .",
    "naively , as @xmath73 , one also expects @xmath30 to grow with energy .",
    "however , as the interaction area also grows with energy , the situation is not so clear . from ( [ eq : phys12 ] ) and ( [ eq : phys13 ] ) it is easily seen that the @xmath30 dependence on @xmath7 , @xmath71 , is determined by the ratio @xmath74 . in figure [ fig:3]b we present @xmath71 ; in the figure",
    "is shown as well the percolation threshold : @xmath75 .    finally , in fig .  [ fig:3]c",
    ", we show the dependence of @xmath5 on energy , see ( [ eq : toy9 ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b , in comparison with experimental points .",
    "if the `` coins in boxes '' model reflects the physical situation , we expect @xmath5 to reach a minimum at @xmath76 tev , in the lhc energy region .",
    "the behaviour we predict is qualitatively different from what is expected on the basis of extrapolations of other phenomenological models : for instance , consider the wrblewski regularity @xcite : @xmath77 ; this leads to an asymptotic ( @xmath78 ) kno scaling , thus to a levelling off of @xmath5 ( see dashed line in fig .  [ fig:3]c . ) other proposals ( e.g.  @xmath79 in @xcite , and the pythia monte carlo @xcite , respectively dotted line and cross in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]c ) give a monotonically decreasing @xmath5 ; for a discussion of the situation in which @xmath5 continues to decrease at high energy and reaches values smaller than 1 , see @xcite .",
    "we have argued that the energy behaviour of the parameter @xmath5 ( or @xmath80 ) of the multiplicity distribution in _ pp _  collisions is sensitive to the energy dependence of the parton / string transverse density @xmath30 .",
    "if impact parameter overcrowding never occurs ( @xmath30 is always small ) @xmath5 will decrease with energy , reaching , eventually , some asymptotic constant value .",
    "if overcrowding takes place ( @xmath30 increases rapidly with energy ) then @xmath5 necessarily will change its behaviour and start increasing with energy .",
    "the turning point may occur at an energy of the order of 510  tev .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the parameter @xmath5 of the multiplicity distribution is the parameter @xmath5 of the @xmath81-distribution : @xmath82 .",
    "this parameter @xmath5 is also a decreasing function of energy in the @xmath83  tev region . in figure  [ fig:4 ]",
    "we have compared experimental data on @xmath81 distributions to the mentioned parameterisation , with @xmath5 given by the multiplicity distribution values at the same energy .",
    "the agreement is reasonable , and improving with energy .",
