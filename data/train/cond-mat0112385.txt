    "the following hamiltonian describes this system@xcite : @xmath4 here @xmath5 denotes the lattice site , @xmath6 creates a conduction electron , @xmath7 is the local moment on site @xmath5 and @xmath8 is the conduction electron s spin .",

    "[ petersh ] is the kinetic energy of the carriers , the second term couples the carriers to the local moments on which they reside .",
    "the third term couples the local moments ferromagnetically .",
    "this term can be due to , for example , superexchange .",
    "we have an @xmath10-@xmath11 hamiltonian with an additional heisenberg term .",
    "we consider the strong coupling regime in which @xmath12 in our calculations we use the values @xmath13 and @xmath14ev which are in agreement with experimental values in the relevant materials@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the magnetic transition is not driven by the @xmath10-@xmath11 part of the hamiltonian , but only by the superexchange because of the low carrier density .",
    "here we present the wave function we use to study the transport properties of the fmp . our variational calculation in appendix [ varcalcpol ] shows that the fmp is small in the strong coupling regime : the carrier occupies approximately two lattice sites ( see figure [ fig : pgraph ] ) .",
    "we therefore use the following wave function to describe the polaron : @xmath15 where @xmath7 are the polaronic local moments and @xmath16 is the magnetisation of the fmp .",
    "it describes a carrier localised on two lattice sites , with its spin quantised and pointing `` up '' along the direction of @xmath17 to minimise the @xmath10-@xmath11 energy .",
    "the @xmath10-@xmath11 term in the hamiltonian therefore reduces to @xmath18 , which is lower for more aligned local moments .",
    "this means that the carrier introduces an additional coupling between the polaronic moments .",
    "the value of the effective coupling constant can be obtained by expanding the expression for @xmath19 up to first order in @xmath20 for nearly aligned polaronic moments .",
    "we obtain @xmath21 since @xmath22 the moments are nearly aligned , so the polaron energy is @xmath23    in addition to the polaron state with its induced magnetisation there are many more possible states for the carrier in which it does not align any local moments .",
    "these are states in the narrowed band described in ref .  .",
    "since the background fluctuates , these `` band states '' persist at a given location only for a time comparable to the timescale of these fluctuations , which we denote @xmath24",
    ". nevertheless , the fmp would be unstable if a significant number of lower energy band states existed , since the carrier could then tunnel to them and gain energy .    to check whether the fmp is stable we need to estimate the position of the band edge . if the polaron level lies below the band edge , band states with a lower energy are exceedingly rare , and can be neglected .",
    "if on the other hand the band edge lies below the energy of the fmp , the latter is unstable .",
    "we determine the position of the band edge as the lowest energy of a typical band state .",
    "we use a variational approach to calculate this energy ( details are given in appendix [ varcalcband ] ) .",
    "the size of the band state is determined by the balance of the kinetic energy cost of localisation and the gain from the @xmath10-@xmath11 term .",
    "the latter is very small : the carrier aligns its spin with the total magnetisation of the region it is localised in .",
    "this magnetisation is due to statistical fluctuations in the paramagnetic regime , and consequently very small .",
    "we therefore expect the kinetic term to dominate and the band state to be very large .",
    "this is confirmed by our calculation .",
    "we show that typical band states are extended over a region of roughly 10@xmath25 lattice sites .",
    "their total energy is very close to @xmath26 ( see equation ( [ largebandstateenergy ] ) ) .",
    "therefore the polaron level lies below the band edge in the regime we consider ( @xmath27 ) , and the fmp is stable .",
    "this concludes our discussion of the static properties of the fmp and the band state . in the next section",
    "we determine their dynamic properties .",
    "in this section we consider the fih mechanism in detail and calculate the hopping rate of the polaron and the resulting electrical resistivity .",
    "let us examine the time evolution of a single carrier that is injected onto a lattice site in an empty system .",
    "the local moments in its vicinity can not respond immediately to the carrier s presence , but react on a timescale @xmath28 .",
    "on timescales smaller than @xmath28 , the background appears static .",
    "a completely static background would cause anderson localisation@xcite and trap the carrier in a state in the tail of the band below the mobility edge .",
    "although localised , the carrier has not yet induced any alignment between local moments in its vicinity ; it is in one of the band states described above . only when the moments have aligned themselves is the energy of the state greatly reduced .",
    "this means that there is a large energy barrier that prevents the carrier from making thermal hops out of the region of alignment .",
    "however , the energy of band states fluctuates because the local moments fluctuate .",
    "it can therefore cross the polaron level .",
    "at such a crossing the electron can tunnel to this level , since there is no more energy barrier to overcome .",
    "we call this tunnelling process fluctuation induced hopping ( fih ) . after the electron tunnelled ,",
    "the entire fmp has moved : carrier and alignment have jumped to another site .",
    "we summarise the entire time evolution in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeline ] .",
    "the occurrences of hops are uncorrelated in time and space since the background of local moments is paramagnetic .",
    "fih is therefore a markoff process and the fmp executes a random walk . in an ensemble of realisations of the polaron and",
    "the background , polarons in different realisations follow different paths .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of the polaron , defined as the fraction of realisations in an ensemble that have the fmp at a specified time at a specified location , obeys the diffusion equation.@xcite the diffusion constant in this equation characterises the polaron transport in the long time limit .    for a random walk in three dimensions that consists of hops of @xmath29 lattice constants , occurring with a frequency @xmath30 , the diffusion constant is:@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the lattice constant .",
    "the resistivity from polaron transport is then obtained from the diffusion constant by means of the einstein formula : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mobility , and @xmath35 the number density of polarons .",
    "we calculate the rate at which band state levels cross the polaron level .",
    "such a crossing occurs when the band state energy fluctuates so much that it lies at or below the polaron level .",
    "the crossing rate depends on the size of the band state : the energy gap between the fmp and band states depends on their size .",
    "in addition to this , we will see that the energy of large band states fluctuates less .",
    "first we calculate the crossing rate for small band states .",
    "the energy difference between the polaron and a small band state is only due to the difference in exchange energy since their kinetic energies are identical .",

    "we neglect the variance of the polaronic exchange energy since it is very small due to the large effective coupling constant of the polaronic moments ( see appendix [ sec : small ] ) .",

    "a pair of spins at @xmath38 is completely uncorrelated with itself at @xmath39 , so that in this limit the correlator reduces to @xmath41 .",

    "temperature level crossings become more rare .",
    "the decrease in the timescale of the spin fluctuations is more than offset by the increase of the average misalignment of the local moments .",
    "for @xmath63 the temperature dependences differ : @xmath64 tends to @xmath65 since the spins are completely uncorrelated , whereas @xmath66 vanishes as @xmath67 .",
    "moreover the timescale of the fluctuations is different:@xcite @xmath68 .",
    "hence @xmath69 tends to a constant in this limit : @xmath70 the reason is that the local moments are completely disordered in this regime ; an increase in temperature does not cause an increase in disorder .",
    "the crossover between the two regimes occurs at a temperature of about @xmath71 .",
    "equations ( [ taux3a ] ) and ( [ taux3b ] ) constitute the principal result of this section .",
    "however , before proceeding to the estimate of the diffusion constant we should check that fluctuations of other band states - in particular those involving rearrangements of many spins - do not change our conditions .",
    "we calculate the crossing rate of large band states with the polaron level in the same way as before ( see appendix [ sec : large band states ] for details ) . for a level crossing with a large band state ,",
    "many local moments need to fluctuate into alignment simultaneously .",
    "this is a very unlikely event , and one expects the crossing rate to be accordingly small .",
    "this expectation is borne out by our calculation . in appendix",
    "[ sec : large band states ] we show that level crossings with large band states can be neglected safely .      when a crossing occurs it is possible , but not necessary , for the fmp to hop .",
    "the probability , @xmath72 , of a hop of length @xmath29 at a level crossing depends on the overlap between polaron and band state wave functions and on the rate at which the levels cross .",
    "the frequency at which hops of length @xmath29 occur , @xmath30 , is then @xmath73 since the number of small band states a distance @xmath29 away from the fmp is roughly proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "the tunnelling probability from the polaron state , @xmath75 , to the band state , @xmath76 with energies @xmath77 and @xmath78 is given by the landau - zener formula @xcite @xmath79 , \\label{zenerstransitionprob}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the hamiltonian for the particle .",
    "here we have @xmath81 , since the energy difference is due to the initially unaligned local moments in the band state .",
    "the time in which this difference between the levels disappears is @xmath82 .",
    "the spatial extent of the wave functions of the polaron and the small band state limits the hopping range to one lattice constant .",
    "the overlap between neighbouring small polaron states given is by : @xmath83 where the sites 0 and 1 are nearest neighbours and 1 and 2 are nearest neighbours .",
    "therefore the hopping probability at a level crossing between two neighbouring energy levels is given by : @xmath84\\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx & 1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath85 .",
    "this means also that the probability is largely independent of temperature .",
    "we will therefore take the hopping probability at a level crossing between two neighbouring levels to be 1 .",

    "we plot the resistivity versus temperature in figure [ fig : rhovst ] interpolating between the high and the extremely high temperature regime .",
    "firstly , the fmp can only hop to neighbouring sites when a favourable statistical fluctuation aligns the local moments .",
    "these fluctuations are statistically likely in the sense that they can be estimated from the rms deviation of the spin fluctuations",
    ". occurrences of alignment far from the polaron do not lead to hopping . secondly ,",
    "while small polarons typically hop by this process , large ones can not .",
    "the required spin fluctuation into the correct configuration is statistically very rare .",
    "thirdly , the timescale of the spin fluctuation is slow enough that the fmp hops with probability 1 once the requisite configuration is obtained .",
    "fourthly , the diffusion constant decreases and the resistivity increases as a function of temperature .",
    "this reflects the increasing time intervals between the level crossings for higher temperatures and the relation between the resistivity and the diffusion constant .",
    "* temperature dependence of the resistivity.*,width=316 ]    the resistivity we obtained is `` metallic '' : it increases with temperature , even though we are not considering a metallic system at all .",
    "it is interesting to compare our result to the resistivity of a very dirty metal , where @xmath87 , @xmath88 being the mean free path for the carriers .",
    "in such a material the drude formula for the resistivity yields : @xmath89 it is clear that despite its temperature dependence the polaron hopping resistivity is far too large to be confused with scattering of metallic carriers .",
    "the mean free path in the dirty metal would need to approach one lattice constant for the resistivities to be comparable .",
    "at such short mean free paths the metallic picture of delocalised carriers breaks down .",
    "we have proposed a new transport mechanism for fmp in a fluctuating disordered background of local moments . in our theory",
    "the fmp hops at the occurrence of a favourable fluctuation .",
    "the transport mechanism is therefore not activated , but gives rise to a `` metallic '' resistivity .",
    "experimentally our theory can be checked by a measurement of the temperature dependent resistivity .",
    "such measurements have been performed in two systems in which the presence of a fmp has been suggested : the mn - pyrochlores and eub@xmath0 .    in the mn - pyrochlores@xcite",
    "the resistivity decreases with increasing temperature above @xmath90 .",
    "this is not in accord with our predictions .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "there are different types of disorder that affect the resistivity , but were not taken into account in our work . in the in - doped compounds @xcite ,",
    "there is a miscibility gap for dopings of @xmath91 . in this regime",
    "the bulk consists of two types of grains , each of a distinct phase with a different lattice parameter .",
    "transport is dominated by processes associated with the grain boundaries .",
    "phase separation is suspected to occur in the sc - doped materials as well .",
    "a different type of disorder occurs in bi - doped compounds : a bi ion introduces a strong - scattering 6@xmath10 vacancy on the tl - sublattice .",
    "this could bind the polaron , making its hopping activated .",
    "both the scattering centres and the grain boundaries make the predicted resistivity difficult to observe .",
    "eub@xmath0 is a much cleaner system , in which magnetic polarons have been observed by spin flip raman scattering experiments.@xcite there is good qualitative agreement with experiment in the high temperature paramagnetic regime .",
    "the resistivity increases rapidly with temperature up to about 150k and then more slowly ; at temperatures above 200k the resistivity increases even more slowly.@xcite this agrees qualitatively with the crossover we predict . the crossover temperature",
    "we predict , 225k is only a little bit too large .",
    "the slowdown above 200k is probably due to other scattering mechanisms for the local moments , such as spin - orbit coupling and scattering by carriers .",
    "there is no quantitative agreement as no @xmath92 law is observed .",
    "this is probably due to material specific complications that our theory does not take into account : eub@xmath0 exhibits two distinct magnetic transitions between phases with different magnetic anisotropies.@xcite    there is good agreement as well with the 2-dimensional monte carlo simulation@xcite .",
    "the simulation and our work agree qualitatively on the static characteristics of the polaron , such as the temperature and @xmath93 dependence of its size and the core magnetisation .",
    "we also agree on the temperature window in which the fmp exists .",
    "we do not expect more than qualitative agreement given the different parameter regimes that were explored : the simulation uses a much weaker superexchange coupling . the discrepancy between the results for the binding energy in the critical regime can be understood .",
    "the simulations show a decrease in magnitude with temperature and we predict an increase .",
    "this is due to the breakdown of our high temperature approximation .",
    "this also explains why the simulation observes a larger polaron : we neglect the correlations between local moments except those induced by the presence of the carrier , whereas the simulation takes all correlations into account .",
    "the results for the dynamic characteristics of the fmp are different .",
    "the simulation shows a diffusion constant that is nearly independent of temperature .",
    "this result does not take into account the decrease of the timescale of the fluctuations : the diffusion constant is calculated as the average hopping per unit monte carlo time , defined as the number of rediagonalisations . to correct for this we divide the numerical diffusion constant by @xmath82 .",
    "this correction increases the discrepancy since the diffusion constant now decreases as a function of temperature .",
    "the discrepancy between the corrected monte carlo diffusion constant and our result indicates that the simulation looks at a slightly different form of polaron transport . in the simulation",
    "the polarons are larger than in our work .",
    "larger polarons can move if a shell of neighbouring local moments aligns themselves .",
    "this motion `` through accretion '' was not taken into account in our result , which was derived for a small fmp . our theory and",

    "this work was supported in part by epsrc and trinity college cambridge .",
    "we determine the size and energy of the fmp in strong coupling regime by a variational calculation .",
    "we choose a trial wave function for the carrier and obtain the electron density at the local moments , which acts as an external field on the moments .",
    "the resulting alignment and decrease in energy is calculated using curie - weiss theory .",
    "the expectation value of the energy of the trial wave function is then minimised with respect to the size of the wave function .",
    "a gaussian - like function is used for the electronic part of the trial wave function for the fmp ; in the notation of eqn .

    "@xmath98 is the state vector of the polaronic local moments .",
    "the wings of this wave function take into account that a trapped electron can nearly always make short excursions to a neighbouring non - polaronic local moment .",
    "this is possible since it has nearly always a spin component parallel to this moment .",
    "these excursions diminish the polaron energy insofar as they reduce the magnetisation of the core through a reduced electron density .",
    "the magnetisation of the background resulting from the presence of the carrier is obtained from curie - weiss theory : @xmath99 , \\label{magnetisation}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the brillouin function and @xmath101 is the electron density at site @xmath95 .",
    "curie - weiss theory neglects spatial correlations between the local moments that are not due to the effective field of the carrier and the induced magnetisation itself .",
    "these spatial correlations are small in a paramagnet , since the coupling constant of the non - polaronic moments is much smaller than the effective field in the core of the fmp ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "curie - weiss theory is therefore accurate in the core of the polaron . in the critical regime",
    "non - polaronic correlations become important .",

    "we see that the fmp is small : its size is of the order of a lattice constant over a wide range of temperatures for realistic values of the parameters .",
    "the calculated magnetisation is always close to saturation in the core of the polaron , but decreases slightly as a function of temperature . for higher temperatures",
    "the fmp shrinks and its energy increases .",
    "this is because at constant size the energy gain from the @xmath10-@xmath11 term decreases as the temperature is raised . to compensate the polaron shrinks , so",
    "that the effective field due to the carrier increases , which results in a magnetic energy gain . hence , at higher temperatures , the point of minimum energy is shifted towards smaller sizes .",
    "this also means that a smaller @xmath10-@xmath11 coupling increases the size .",
    "the increase of the polaron energy with temperature can be understood as follows : the kinetic energy is independent of temperature and a decreasing function of size .",
    "the magnetic energy curve shifts up as temperature is raised and is an increasing function of size .",
    "therefore , the minimum value of the total energy increases with temperature .",
    "these results are in close agreement with ref . which refers specifically to the pyrochlores .",
    "our calculation is well - behaved at the ferromagnetic transition , even though this temperature lies outside its range of validity .",
    "as @xmath104 is approached from above , the polaron size tends to a value of approximately @xmath105 at @xmath104 . neither the present calculation , nor ref .   takes the correlations of local moments outside the fmp into account .",
    "the predicted size is therefore too small in the critical regime and the energy is overestimated .",

    "<S> a magnetic polaron is a composite object consisting of a localised charge carrier and the alignment it induces in a background of local moments . </S>",
    "<S> localisation can occur for two different reasons : the carrier can be trapped by an impurity atom and then induce a magnetisation in the region where it is localised . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting particle is called a `` bound magnetic polaron '' ( bmp ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is well documented experimentally , for example in dilute magnetic semiconductors like cd@xmath1mn@xmath2se @xcite , and in rare earth chalcogenides@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been studied in depth theoretically@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a bmp is not free to roam through the sample since it is bound to its impurity . </S>",
    "<S> only activated transport is possible : when the bmp is `` ionised '' the carrier is free to move until it is trapped by the next impurity .    </S>",
    "<S> however , for large enough coupling to the local moments the carrier can self - trap without the need for an impurity@xcite , forming a free magnetic polaron ( fmp ) . due to the coupling the carrier acts as a magnetic field on the local moments . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of this field varies in space as the probability density of the carrier : the more localised the carrier the stronger the field and the larger the energy gain resulting from aligning the local moments . </S>",
    "<S> the region of aligned moments therefore acts as a potential well that localises the electron and a fmp is formed . </S>",
    "<S> the balance between the gain in magnetic energy from induced alignment and the loss in kinetic energy because of localisation determines the polaron size . </S>",

    "<S> the conventional view is that transport is necessarily activated , as for a bmp . here </S>",
