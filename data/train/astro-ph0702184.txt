    "global rotation of galaxy clusters has been suggested for several galaxy clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , but there are still no conclusive evidences of cluster rotation .",
    "there are two kinds of objects to consider with regard to the rotation of galaxy clusters : intracluster medium ( icm ) and the galaxies .    for icm ,",
    "recent studies have searched for the bulk motion or the velocity gradient of icm in several clusters using _ asca _ and _ chandra _ data .",
    "@xcite directly detected , for the first time , icm bulk motions in the outer regions of the centaurus ( abell 3526 ) and the perseus ( abell 426 ) clusters using _ asca _ data .",
    "later , @xcite identified two more clusters ( abell 576 and rx j0419.5 + 0225 ) that have the most significant velocity gradients among 12 clusters for which velocity mapping could be performed with useful precision in the _ asca _ archive .",
    "recently , @xcite measured the velocity difference of ( 2.4@xmath11.0)@xmath2 km s@xmath3 for the regions opposed around the center of icm in the centaurus cluster using _ chandra _ data . if this velocity difference is due to the gas circulation around the cluster center , then the corresponding circular velocity will be as large as ( 1.2@xmath10.7)@xmath2 km s@xmath3",
    ".    for the galaxies in clusters , the global velocity gradient suggestive of cluster rotation has been detected in some clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that 13 clusters show significant velocity gradients in the range of 240@xmath01230 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 among 72 clusters .",
    "@xcite reported that three clusters ( abell 1139 , abell 1663 , and abell s333 ) exhibit velocity - position characteristics consistent with the presence of possible cluster rotation , shear , or infall dynamics .",
    "up to now , there is only one galaxy cluster of which global rotation of galaxies was studied in detail : abell 2107 .",
    "@xcite found from the analysis of 75 member galaxies that abell 2107 appears to be a regular cluster ( single peaked galaxy distribution , regular x - ray morphology , and gaussian velocity histogram ) , but has spatially correlated velocities of galaxies ( high and low velocity galaxies are segregated spatially ) .",
    "they concluded that the spatial distribution of galaxy velocity is consistent with a rotation of a single cluster at 98 % confidence level .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that the virial mass of abell 2107 determined in their study , should be reduced from ( 3.2@xmath10.6)@xmath4 to ( 2.8@xmath10.5)@xmath4 due to the correction for the cluster rotation .",
    "theoretically , a galaxy cluster is expected to acquire angular momentum through an off - axis merging or a global rotation of the universe .",
    "first , off - axis merging between two clusters is expected to provide angular momentum to the clusters , resulting in rotating clusters @xcite . according to off - axis merging models , the global rotation of `` collisional '' icm originated by merging survives longer than that of `` collisionless '' galaxies in clusters @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is expected that it is more difficult to detect the global rotation of galaxies than that of icm .",
    "secondly , the global rotation of the universe may provide angular momentum to the celestial bodies on their formation , resulting in rotating systems @xcite .",
    "li model explains the empirical relation between the angular momenta and the masses of galaxies .",
    "later , @xcite showed that li model predicts the presence of a minimum ( i.e. vanishing angular momentum ) in the relation between the angular momenta and the masses of celestial bodies .",
    "their prediction was observationally tested by @xcite ; vanishing angular momenta for the masses corresponding to the galaxy groups and non - vanshing angular momenta for smaller and larger structures ( compact groups and rich galaxy clusters ) . however , the non - vanishing angular momenta for galaxy clusters were found indirectly based on the study of the galaxy orientation .",
    "therefore , it is needed to probe the angular momenta of galaxy clusters directly based on dynamical analysis .",
    "recently , galaxy redshift surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) and the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , @xcite ) have provided redshift data for large samples of galaxies . therefore , by identifying member galaxies in clusters using the redshift and the positional data",

    "we used the data for the spectroscopic sample of galaxies in the fifth data release of sdss , and in the final data release of 2dfgrs @xcite .",
    "the sdss data release 5 contains five - band ( _ u , g , r , i , z _ ) photometric data for 215 million objects over 8,000 deg@xmath8 , and optical spectroscopic data for one million objects of galaxies , quasars , and stars over 5,740 deg@xmath8 .",

    "we used only the galaxies with q @xmath11 3 in this study .",
    "since some galaxies were covered in both sdss and 2dfgrs , we matched the galaxies found in sdss with those in 2dfgrs to make a master catalog of galaxies .",
    "the mean difference of radial velocities between the measurements of sdss and 2dfgrs for 31,300 matched galaxies is @xmath1313 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we corrected the velocities of galaxies in sdss by the mean difference of radial velocities , and used the average value of the velocities measured in sdss and in 2dfgrs for further analysis .",
    "we used the abell catalog of galaxy clusters @xcite to find the clusters in the survey data . among the abell clusters ,",
    "we selected the clusters that have known spectroscopic redshifts in nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) . finally , we selected 899 clusters located within the survey regions of sdss and 2dfgrs as a sample of clusters for further analysis .",
    "we applied the following procedure to identify the rotating cluster candidates in sdss and 2dfgrs :    1 .   in order to select the member galaxies in the target clusters , we used `` shifting gapper '' method of @xcite . in the plot of radial velocity versus clustercentric distance of galaxies for a given cluster , we selected the galaxies as cluster members using a velocity gap of 950 km s@xmath3 and a distance bin of 0.2 mpc shifting along the clustercentric distance from the cluster center .",
    "we used a larger bin width if the number of galaxies in a bin is less than 15 .",
    "we applied the method to the galaxies within the radius at which the distance between adjacent galaxies is larger than 0.1 mpc .",
    "we iterated the procedure until the number of cluster members becomes stable .",
    "finally , we selected 56 galaxy clusters in which the number of member galaxies is greater than or equal to 40 for further analysis .",
    "2 .   to investigate the global rotational property of galaxy clusters",
    ", we fit the observed radial velocities @xmath14 of the cluster galaxies with a function of a position angle , + @xmath15 + where @xmath16 is the projected position angle of a galaxy relative to the cluster center ( measured from north to east ) , @xmath17 is the projected position angle of the rotation axis of the cluster , @xmath18 is the rotation amplitude , and @xmath19 is the systemic velocity of the galaxy cluster .",
    "+ similarly , the effect of the global rotation of galaxy clusters can appear as a velocity gradient across the cluster . to investigate the global velocity gradient",
    ", we fit the observed radial velocities of the cluster galaxies with a function of a position in the plane of the sky , + @xmath20 + where x and y are clustercentric distances in the direction of right ascension and declination , respectively .",
    "we fit the observed radial velocities of cluster galaxies using equation ( [ eq - rot ] ) and ( [ eq - fit ] ) with @xmath19 as a fixed value of the mean radial velocity of cluster galaxies ( the biweight location of @xcite ) .",
    "+ in figure [ fig - rotcand ] , we plot the velocity dispersions ( the biweight scale of @xcite ) of galaxy clusters as a function of @xmath21 , the ratio of absolute value of the rotation amplitude to the velocity dispersion ( left panel ) , and as a function of @xmath22 , the global velocity gradient ( right panel ) . figure [ fig - rotcand ] shows that there are four clusters ( a1035 , a1373 , a2034 , and a4053 ) of which velocity dispersions are unusually large ( @xmath23 1300 km s@xmath3 ) , while the majority of clusters are in the range of 290 km s@xmath24 1050 km s@xmath3 .",
    "large velocity dispersions of these four clusters might be related to the two superimposed or interacting clusters with slightly different systemic velocities ( to be discussed in section [ notes ] ) . +",
    "it is expected that a rotating cluster has a large ratio of the absolute value of rotation amplitude to the velocity dispersion , and has a large global velocity gradient across the cluster .",
    "therefore , among the selected 56 galaxy clusters , we selected 12 tentative rotating clusters of which the ratios of the absolute value of rotation amplitude to the velocity dispersion are greater than 0.53 , and the global velocity gradients are greater than 380 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "we chose these critical values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 because the rotation amplitudes of the clusters above these values are significant above @xmath27 level .",
    "in addition , the dips are seen at the critical values in both figure [ fig - rotcand ] ( c ) and ( d ) , implying that a segregation between the rotating and non - rotating clusters might exist , although it is not known whether there is a discrete boundary of the rotation amplitude between the rotating and non - rotating clusters or not .",

    "[ tab - rot ] , there are two clusters ( a1035 and a1373 ) that have unusually large rotation amplitudes ( @xmath23 1300 km s@xmath3 ) and velocity gradients ( @xmath23 1900 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ) due to the superimposed two disparate groups ( to be discussed in section [ notes ] ) .",

    "in order to identify the connection between the cluster morphology and the cluster dynamics , it is useful to determine the ellipticity and the orientation of a cluster using a spatial distribution of the selected member galaxies . to determine the cluster shape , we use the method of the dispersion ellipse of the bivariate normal frequency function of position vectors ( e.g. @xcite ) . the dispersion ellipse is defined in @xcite as the contour",

    "a single cluster in rotation is expected to show a spatial segregation of high and low velocity galaxies , and to have a single number density peak unlike the case two clusters are still in the middle of merging .",

    "abell 1035 has the largest x - ray luminosity and the velocity dispersion in the sample of tentative rotating clusters .",

    "in addition , the ds plot in figure [ fig - sub ] shows two subclusterings ( north and south ) that coinside with high density regions in the galaxy number density map .",
    "therefore , the large amplitudes of the rotation and the velocity gradient including the large velocity dispersion ( listed in table [ tab - cand ] ) , can be explained by two superimposed or interacting clusters with slightly different systemic velocities .",
    "@xcite found that the spin - vector orientations of the galaxies in this cluster tend to lie parallel to the local supercluster ( lsc ) plane , and the spin - vector projections of the galaxies tend to be oriented perpendicular with respect to the direction of the lsc center . in this study , we found that the angle between the rotation axis ( y1 ) of this cluster and the lsc plane is @xmath76 deg . since the angle between the spin - vector orientations of the galaxies in this cluster and",

    ", the galaxy number density map shows a single density peak near the cluster center rather than strong concentrations around two substructures .",

    "similar to the case of abell 1035 , the substructures introduced by the clustering of galaxies with different velocities coincide with the galaxy number density peaks , implying that the large amplitudes of rotation and velocity gradient are introduced by two disparate groups ( see figure [ fig - sub ] ) .",

    "since the position angles ( 138 deg for the major axis and 48 deg for the minor axis ) of the dispersion ellipse deviate from those ( 207 deg for y1 and 186 deg for y2 ) of the rotation axes , it appears that the high ellipticity is not related to the global rotation of this cluster .",

    "neither a distinct substructure nor a significant local density peak is found except for the cluster center in figure [ fig - sub ] .",
    "interestingly , it appears that the radial distribution of the member galaxies in figure [ fig - member ] is discontinuous at @xmath79 .",

    "the cluster morphology determined in section [ morph ] is given in the column ( 5 ) : ` spherical ' for ellipticity @xmath82 and ` elongated ' for ellipticity @xmath83 .",
    "the dynamical status determined in section [ discuss ] is given in the column ( 6 ) and the selection of probable rotating clusters is in the final column ( 7 ) .",
    "the study of dynamical state of the propable rotating clusters is useful for understanding the origin of the global rotation across the cluster .",
    "it is expected from self - similar models that a relationship between the x - ray luminosity and the velocity dispersion of the clusters exists as @xmath84 ( e.g. @xcite ) . for galaxy clusters in sdss",
    ", @xcite found the relation of @xmath85 . for galaxy clusters in 2dfgrs , @xcite found the relation of @xmath86 , and suggested that high-@xmath87 clusters are more dynamically evolved systems than the low-@xmath87 clusters . in figure [ fig - xray ] , we plot the x - ray luminosity as a function of the velocity dispersion and the virial mass for the probable rotating clusters ( filled circles ) of which x - ray luminosities are available in the literature in comparison with the non - rotating galaxy clusters ( open circles ) of which x - ray luminosities are available in the literature among the selected 56 galaxy clusters .",
    "we plot the x - ray luminosities from the several literature separately .",
    "it appears that most galaxy clusters shown in figure [ fig - xray ] follow @xmath88 and @xmath89 relations ( solid lines ) determined in this study .",
    "moreover , several interesting features are seen in the probable rotating clusters .",
    "first , the probable rotating clusters do not deviate from the best - fit line , implying that those clusters are in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "secondly , the velocity dispersions and the virial masses for the probable rotating clusters appear to be smaller than those for the non - rotating clusters . in addition",
    ", the x - ray luminosities for the probable rotating clusters also appear to be smaller than those for the non - rotating clusters .",
    "if we adopt the result of @xcite , the probable rotating clusters that have low x - ray luminosities might have a lower fraction of early - type , passively evolving galaxies than the galaxy clusters with high x - ray luminosities .",
    "if galaxy clusters rotate , the velocity dispersions and the corresponding virial masses should be corrected for the cluster rotation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we derived the velocity dispersions about the best fit rotation curve of equation ( [ eq - rot ] ) and the corresponding corrected virial masses for the probable rotating clusters .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab - corr ] .",
    "the first and the second columns represent , respectively , the velocity dispersion about the mean velocity of the cluster and that about the best fit rotation curve of equation ( [ eq - rot ] ) .",
    "the third and the fourth columns represent , respectively , the virial mass using the rotation uncorrected ( the first column ) velocity dispersion and that using the rotation corrected ( the second column ) velocity dispersion .",
    "the velocity dispersions are reduced by 6@xmath014% , and on the average are reduced by 11% .",
    "the corresponding virial masses are also reduced by 11@xmath027% , and on the average are reduced by 21% .",
    "the dynamics of the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) or cd galaxies in galaxy clusters are also useful for understanding the formation history of galaxy clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , a peculiar velocity of bcgs , which is defined by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is a radial velocity of bcgs and @xmath92 is a mean velocity of the cluster , is a useful indicator of the dynamical state for the cluster @xcite .",
    "to estimate the peculiar velocities of bcgs in clusters , we first identified the bcgs that have the smallest @xmath12 magnitudes in the catalog of member galaxies for the selected 56 galaxy clusters .",
    "then we conducted a visual inspection of cluster images whether there are any brighter galaxies than the selected bcgs using the catalog of member galaxies .",
    "since some brightest galaxies in galaxy clusters were not covered due to the observational difficulties such as a fiber collision and a saturation , we finally selected 20 galaxy clusters of which bcgs in the catalog agree with those in the images . using the sample of selected 20 galaxy clusters , we plot the absolute value of the peculiar velocity of bcgs as a function of the clustercentric distance , the redshift of clusters as a function of the absolute magnitude of bcgs in @xmath12 band , and the velocity dispersion of clusters as a function of the absolute value of the peculiar velocity of bcgs .",
    "it is seen that the absolute values of peculiar velocities of the bcgs are in the range of 10@xmath0780 km s@xmath3 , and the median value of peculiar velocities is 257 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the mean uncertainty for the values of peculiar velocities is 168 km s@xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the clustercentric distances of bcgs are in the rage of 0@xmath0300 kpc , and the median value of clustercentric distances is 82 kpc .",
    "interestingly , the peculiar velocities and the clustercentric distances of bcgs for two ( a0954 and a1399 ) probable rotating clusters are smaller than the median value of each parameter . the small peculiar velocity and the small spatial deviation of bcgs from the cluster center indicate that the clusters are in the dynamical equilibrium",
    ". it may imply that the clusters do not undergo a recent merging if the clusters are formed through a repeated merging .",
    "in addition , the absolute magnitudes of bcgs for two probable rotating clusters do not show any significant deviation from the distribution of the non - rotating galaxy clusters .      an interesting connection between the global rotation of clusters and the anisotropy in galaxy alignments for clusters is expected in the context of angular momentum in galaxy clusters :    1 .",
    "@xcite found that the anisotropy in galaxy alignments increases systematically from early - type ( bm type i ) to late - type ( bm type ii - iii and iii ) clusters .",
    "interestingly , four of six probable rotating clusters in this study are late - type clusters .",
    "therefore , there may exist a connection between the rotation axes of the probable rotating clusters in this study and the spin - vector orientations of cluster galaxies . in order to examine this connection ,",
    "we present in figure [ fig - ori ] the spatial distribution and the histogram for the projected spin - vector orientations of galaxies in six probable rotating clusters .",
    "we used an orientation parameter ( orient ) in 2dfgrs and an isophotal position angle parameter in @xmath93 band ( isophi@xmath94 g ) in sdss as the projected spin - vector orientations for cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "the position angles of the projected orientations for the cluster galaxies are measured in the range of @xmath95 deg , but are plotted twice in the range of @xmath96 deg .",
    "figure [ fig - ori ] shows that there is no strong anisotropy in spin - vector orientations of cluster galaxies ( i.e. no strong peak in histogram ) .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to compare the position angle of the rotation axes and that of the spin - vector orientations of cluster galaxies . 2 .",
    "it was found that spin - vector orientations of galaxies in clusters tend to lie parallel to the local supercluster ( lsc ) plane @xcite . in order to investigate the connection between the rotation axes of rotating clusters and the lsc plane , we plot in figure [ fig - lsc ] all - sky distribution of six probable rotating clusters with their rotation axes ( y1 ) in the supergalactic",
    "it appears that there are no preferred directions of rotation axes for six probable rotating clusters , while spin - vector orientations of cluster galaxies in @xcite and @xcite tend to lie parallel to the local supercluster ( lsc ) plane ( the results does not change if we use y2 instead of y1 ) .    since we do not know the three - dimensional information about the rotation axis for rotating clusters and the three - dimensional spin - vector orientations of cluster galaxies in this study , it is difficult to conclude the connection between the global rotation of clusters and the anisotropy in galaxy alignments for clusters at this moment .",
    "therefore , it is needed to study the three - dimensional spatial orientations of galaxies for these rotating clusters to investigate this connection .",
    "based on the model proposed by @xcite that the global rotation of the universe may provide angular momentum to celestial bodies on their formation , @xcite found the vanishing angular momenta for the masses corresponding to the galaxy groups using tully s galaxy groups .",
    "they suggested the non - vanshing angular momenta for smaller and larger structures ( compact galaxy groups and rich galaxy clusters ) .",
    "however , the non - vanishing angular momenta for galaxy clusters were found indirectly based on the study of the galaxy orientation . in this study",
    ", we found the non - vanishing angular momenta for galaxy clusters directly based on the dynamical analysis .",
    "this result is consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "however , we found that the estimated masses for rotating clusters are in the range of @xmath97 ( see table [ tab - corr ] ) .",
    "in addition , we could not identify rotating clusters in massive clusters with @xmath98 .",
    "intriguingly , the mass range of rotating clusters in this study is corresponding to the mass scale ( @xmath97 ) with _ vanishing _ angular momentum predicted by @xcite .",
    "since the masses of tully s galaxy groups used in @xcite are expected to be smaller than those of abell clusters used in this study , this contradiction of the mass scale between the theory and the observation should be investigated further .",
    "we present a result of searching for galaxy clusters that show an indication of global rotation using a spectroscopic sample of galaxies in sdss and 2dfgrs .",
    "our results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we have determined the member galaxies of 899 abell clusters covered in sdss and 2dfgrs .",
    "we have estimated the ratio of rotation amplitude to velocity dispersion , and the velocity gradient for 56 clusters in which the number of member galaxies are greater than or equal to 40 .",

    "we have determined the cluster morphology for 12 tentative rotating clustersmight using the dispersion ellipse method .",
    "the ellipticity of the dispersion ellipse is in the range of 0.08@xmath00.57 , and the position angle of major or minor axis appears not to be related to the position angles of rotation axes ( y1 and y2 ) .",
    "we have investigated the substructures ( 1d , 2d , and 3d ) for the sample of tentative rotating clusters .",
    "ds plots show that the majority ( 9 out of 12 ) of clusters show an evidence of substructure due to the spatially correlated velocities of galaxies .",
    "we have selected six probable rotating clusters ( abell 0954 , abell 1139 , abell 1399 , abell 2162 , abell 2169 , and abell 2366 ) that show a single number density peak around the cluster center with a spatial segregation of the high and low velocity galaxies in clusters .",
    "the probable rotating clusters do not deviate significantly from the relation of the x - ray luminosity and the velocity dispersion or the virial mass of the clusters .",
