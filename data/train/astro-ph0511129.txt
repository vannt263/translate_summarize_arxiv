    "measurements of the polarized component of the cosmic microwave background ( cmbp ) are keenly sought to provide an independent measurement of cosmological parameters and verify the precision of certain assumptions that form the basis of cosmological models .",
    "measurements of the cmbp can also give greater insights into both the re - ionization and inflation processes than can be gained from temperature data alone ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these measurements are best made at frequencies above 30  ghz and are technically difficult . at any frequency",
    "the measurements are expected to suffer from foreground contaminants such as galactic synchrotron emission and dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the synchrotron emission expected to dominate up to 100  ghz .",
    "observations of galactic synchrotron emission at lower frequencies will provide a measure of its potential to contaminate the cmbp signal .",
    "there have been no polarization surveys of large areas of sky at frequencies above 2.7 ghz @xcite and so estimates of contamination at the cmbp observing frequencies currently rely on extrapolations from that frequency and from theoretical considerations @xcite .",
    "measurements of sky polarization at shorter centimetre wavelengths would provide useful constraints on that extrapolation .",
    "surveys at higher frequencies have been difficult because of the limited fields of view . in general , the need for wide - field imaging has driven the development of interferometers with smaller array element sizes and single - dish telescopes with receiver arrays at the focal plane .",
    "we describe here a novel method of using existing interferometer arrays for wide field imaging . we have used the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , configured as a set of single - dishes , to make polarimetric observations at 5  ghz .",
    "single - dish radio - polarimetry has not previously been conducted with the atca .",
    "the angular power spectrum of the cmb polarization is predicted to peak around spherical harmonic multipoles @xmath1 , corresponding to a @xmath2 angular scale @xcite . at 5  ghz ( wavelength of 6  cm ) ,",
    "the 22-m atca antennas have an angular resolution of fwhm  @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the 22-m atca antennas , operating in single - dish total power mode at 5  ghz , are well suited for making a survey of the sky polarization at the multipoles of interest to the planned cmb experiments .",
    "the sky regions that have the lowest dust emission are the galactic pole areas .",
    "however , the minimum galactic synchrotron emission is observed at lower latitudes ( @xmath450@xmath5 ) . in particular ,",
    "a region of interest in the southern sky is at ra  @xmath6 dec  @xmath7 @xcite which culminates at high elevations at southern mid - latitudes and so is observable with the atca antennas with low ground spillover .",
    "we describe the methods used at the atca for wide - field radio - polarimetry imaging .",
    "the array s standard interferometer mode was used to characterize the instrumental errors and calibrate the antenna responses , whereas the wide field imaging was done by using the array in single - dish mode with the pointing of the array elements offset to instantaneously cover a wide sky area .",
    "the method has been demonstrated using the atca to image the vela supernova remnant .",
    "the atca is a six - element aperture synthesis radiotelescope that operates at 20 , 13 , 6 , 3 and 1.2  cm and 3.5  mm @xcite .",
    "each element is a 22-m antenna with ( shaped ) cassegrain optics .",
    "each has three receiver packages that operate over pairs of wavelength bands .",
    "receiver tuning and signal sampling are synchronized across the array by a signal ( the local oscillator ) distributed from the array centre .",
    "a range of signal bandwidths can be selected , and each antenna is equipped to provide two observing bands within the tuning range of the receiver package in use . in this work",
    "we have used the 6/3  cm package tuned to two 128  mhz bands centred at 4800 and 4928  mhz . in each band , the signal for each linear polarization is sampled ( 2-bit ) at the nyquist rate , and transmitted on optical fibres to the digital correlator .    in normal operation the correlator computes the cross - correlation of signal pairs from the array , the two polarizations from each of the six elements yielding 60 cross correlations . these are calibrated and integrated to form the complex visibilities used in aperture synthesis image formation .",
    "in addition , autocorrelations and polar cross - correlations are computed for each antenna , and in normal operation are used for calibration .",
    "we made use of these correlation products for the single - dish observations described here .",
    "the atca antennas are on altitude - azimuth mounts and have two orthogonal linearly polarized feeds @xmath8 and @xmath9 inclined 45@xmath10 to the vertical .",
    "the radiation field incident on the telescope feed has contributions @xmath11 from the sky , and sources in the immediate environment such as the atmosphere , the antenna and the ground .",
    "the stray radiation enters the feed both directly and via a number of reflections off the telescope optics and support structures .",
    "although initially unpolarized , response to this radiation in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels may be correlated , resulting in a spurious polarized signal .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the stray radiation and consider it to be partially polarized .",
    "the telescope optics , even for radiation entering along the intended path , is imperfect so there is some leakage of each polarized wave into the other channel . in this section",
    "we follow the treatment of radio polarimetry by @xcite , hereafter hbs96 .",
    "we describe the leakage with the terms @xmath13 and @xmath14 and write a leakage matrix @xmath15 and input vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 as @xmath16 the signal entering the receiver is then @xmath17 the receiver adds noise ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) to each channel and amplifies by gain factors ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) . writing @xmath22 the input vector @xmath23 to the correlator is @xmath24 \\\\           & = & {   \\left (     \\begin{array}{cc }       g_x & 0 \\\\       0 & g_y     \\end{array }   \\right ) } \\nonumber        {   \\left (     \\begin{array}{cc }       e_{x}+s_x+n_x+d_x(e_y+s_y ) \\\\       e_{y}+s_y+n_y - d_y(e_x+s_x )      \\end{array }   \\right ) } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the correlator produces the coherency vector which , in the case of single - dish observations , is the time - averaged outer product ( see hbs96 ) of the input signal with its complex conjugate @xmath25 then ( adopting a convention where @xmath26 ) @xmath27 \\\\     & = & g_{xx}[e_{xx } + s_{xx } + n_{xx }             + d_x(e_{yx } + s_{yx } ) \\\\     & & \\mbox { } + d_x^{\\ast } ( e_{xy } + s_{xy } ) \\\\     & & \\mbox { } + d_x d_x^{\\ast}(e_{yy } + s_{yy})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath28 symbols are omitted but understood and terms such as @xmath29 and @xmath30 are dropped because their factors are uncorrelated and the time - averaged products vanish .",
    "similarly @xmath31\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the receiver noise components @xmath18 and @xmath19 are uncorrelated and so the term @xmath32 vanishes and does not appear in the expression for @xmath33 .    for the atca antennas , the leakage terms are stable and easily measured with the array configured for interferometry",
    ". moreover , they are small ( @xmath34 ) and so second order terms ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , etc . )",
    "can safely be neglected for this experiment .",
    "the components of @xmath37 are then @xmath38 \\\\ yy & = & g_{yy}[e_{yy } + s_{yy } + n_{yy }             + d_y(e_{xy } + s_{xy } )          + d_y^{\\ast } ( e_{yx } + s_{yx } ) ] \\\\ xy & = & g_{xy}[e_{xy } + s_{xy }            + d_x(e_{yy } + s_{yy } )            - d_y^{\\ast } ( e_{xx } + s_{xx } ) ] \\\\ yx & = & xy^{\\ast}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the quantities of interest are the stokes characterisation of the astronomical signal and can be related to the terms in ( @xmath39,@xmath40 ) in the expressions above as ( see hbs96 ) @xmath41 we seek to measure the linearly polarized sky emission which is characterized by @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in equations",
    "710 we use the primed symbols @xmath44 and @xmath45 to emphasize that these are the linear stokes parameters in the frame of the antenna feeds , not the required @xmath42 and @xmath43 defined relative to the cardinal direction on the sky which must be determined by rotation through the parallactic angle @xmath46 later in the analysis . expressed as equivalent temperatures , the typical size of the terms in equations 36 for the parameters of our observations",
    "are @xmath47    it can be seen that @xmath45 can be determined from @xmath33 , the component containing terms in @xmath48 , whereas the determination of @xmath44 involves the difference @xmath49 .",
    "thus any fluctuations or errors in the determination of the receiver gain will , when multiplied by the large terms in equations 3 and 4 , produce large uncertainties in the value of @xmath44 .",
    "for this reason single - dish radio polarimetry is best performed with feeds receptive to opposite hands of circular polarization so that all the uncertainties arising from differencing the parallel handed components of the coherency vector ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) flow into the circular stokes @xmath52 component which is often of less astrophysical interest than the linear polarization .",
    "radio interferometry is protected from this because both the stray radiation @xmath12 and the receiver noise @xmath53 entering the two antennas of each interferometer are uncorrelated .",
    "thus the atca can successfully use linear feeds for polarimetric interferometry . for this experiment ,",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath44 are intolerable and so we must determine the full linear polarization state from measurements of @xmath45 made at several parallactic angles .",
    "this process is described in section [ duq ] .",
    "further practical difficulties arise from the stray radiation which is partially polarized and is a strong function of antenna elevation , and also has some azimuthal dependency .",
    "these dependencies have proven impossible to model and so all our observations have been conducted as `` drift scans '' , in which the antennas are held at a fixed azimuth and elevation , and the measurements are recorded as the sky drifts past at the sidereal rate .",
    "the analysis above does not include the possibility of further additive components of stray signal in the polarized outputs .",
    "examples are the components arising from coupling of receiver noise between the two polarizations in the orthomode transducerr , and from common mode noise from the use of common local oscillators in the frequency conversion stages of the receiver .",
    "these are expected to be constant , independent of antenna pointing , but are difficult to model",
    ". consequently absolute measurements of the polarized emission are not attempted .",
    "all observations are differential , with images of the polarized emission being presented after the subtraction of a baseline from each scan .      at the digitisation stage",
    "prior to correlation , the receiver output signals are normalized . at the atca , the correlator measures correlation coefficients ( which take values in the range [ -1,1 ] ) and to recover the absolute scaling of the coherence measurements a calibration system continously measures and records the system temperature @xmath54 of each polarization channel against a noise signal of known temperature @xmath55 which is injected at 45@xmath10 to the @xmath8,@xmath9 feeds .",
    "typically @xmath56 referred to the face of the feed horn .",
    "the calibration noise signal is switched and a synchronous demodulator measures the signal power @xmath57 and @xmath58 during the off and on phases respectively .",
    "let @xmath59 be the measurement error on the normalized correlator outputs    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the integration time and signal bandwidth , respectively .",
    "a factor @xmath63 can then be used to scale the normalised correlator outputs @xmath64 the measurement error @xmath37 has contributions from the error @xmath65 in the determination of @xmath63 and from the noise @xmath59 on the normalized correlator outputs @xmath66 \\\\\\ ] ] the quantities @xmath57 and @xmath58 are independent , being formed by integrating the signal over distinct time intervals @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 . then @xmath69 and @xmath70 since at the atca @xmath71 ,",
    "the errors in the @xmath72 are dominated by the error in the determination of @xmath63 @xmath73 thus , the application of the online @xmath54 calibration increases the noise in @xmath37 by a factor of about @xmath74 and for this experiment severely limits the sensitivity of the measurements .",
    "in addition , since the calibration signal is injected at @xmath75 to the @xmath8,@xmath9 feeds , it appears as an additional strong polarized component in equation 5 which , when multiplied by uncertainties and fluctuations in @xmath76 could overwhelm the polarized signal from the sky .",
    "our observations were made with the online application of @xmath55 scaling disabled .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath63 was determined independently from separate integrations that bracketted the observations of the sky .",
    "note that the difference in the instrumental path lengths for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 polarizations is expected to be non - zero , and antenna specific but only slowly changing . failing to account for",
    "it rotates the signal between stokes @xmath43 and @xmath52 .",
    "we measured this path - length ( phase ) difference for each antenna by measuring the phase of the calibration signal that is injected at @xmath75 to the @xmath8,@xmath9 feeds .",
    "the phase correction was then applied to the measured @xmath33 values .      to measure the polarized emission from a @xmath77 rectangular patch of sky centred at @xmath78 we performed a series of drift scans of duration @xmath79 , with the six antennas pointed at the same hour angle and each offset in declination from the next by half the width of the primary beam @xmath80 . in successive scans",
    "the declination was incremented by @xmath81 and the hour angle changed ( by approximately @xmath82 ) to scan the same range of right ascensions .",
    "the entire patch was covered after    @xmath83    scans , and then repeated for the required total integration time . in this way each point in the surveyed area was measured at intervals of approximately @xmath84      as described in section [ sdp ] , the atca is able to provide only one correlated output of the linear polarization stokes parameters , @xmath45 . thus @xmath42  and  @xmath43 ( components defined in sky coordinates ) must be constructed starting from this single quantity @xmath45 by performing at least two scans at parallactic angles @xmath46 ideally differing by @xmath85 .",
    "the general case consists of @xmath86 observations of the same pixel performed at several parallactic angles .",
    "the two stokes parameters are estimated through a least square approach .",

    "these errors depend on the set of parallactic angles at which the measurements occur .",
    "the efficiency of the reconstruction thus depends on the scanning strategy adopted , which must be optimized to minimize the error on both @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "considering that the method provides two stokes parameters from measurements of only one , the ideal sensitivity for @xmath86 observations is @xmath99 its comparison with equations  ( [ sqeq ] ) and  ( [ sueq ] ) allows a quantitative estimate of how well @xmath42 and @xmath43 are measured .",
    "in addition , to evaluate the overall effect on the ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) pair , we introduce the mean error @xmath100    for the simplest case with n=2 observations , the best result is obtained when the difference @xmath101 , as expected .",
    "the case n=3 is less trivial . keeping in mind the ideal value ( @xmath102 for @xmath103 ) ,",
    "the case is clear looking at figure  [ sigma3pafig ] , where @xmath104 is kept constant , while the other two angles @xmath105 and @xmath106 are allowed to vary in the 0@xmath5180@xmath5 range .",
    "the best sensitivity occurs when the three angles are evenly separated in a @xmath107 interval , rather than differing by @xmath108 .",
    "the case with @xmath85 separations favours one of the two stokes parameters , resulting in a non - optimal combined sensitivity @xmath59 . in general , the optimum result from @xmath86 observations is obtained with the @xmath107 range sampled with equally spaced parallactic angles .",
    "to provide some confidence in the method , we observed @xmath109 degree region centred on the vela supernova remnant for about 10  hr .",
    "this region emits strong polarized emission and has been well studied at a range of wavelengths and resolutions .",
    "@xcite reported polarimetric observations of the vela nebula at 2.7ghz ( resolution 8.4 arcminutes ) , 5.0 ghz ( 4.4 arcminutes ) and 8.4  ghz ( 3 arcminutes ) .",
    "@xcite measured the polarized emission from the southern galactic plane at 2.4  ghz ( resolution 10.4 arcminutes ) , including the vela region .    we observed the area with repeated 20-minute drift scans .",
    "each scan was started with all antennas set to @xmath110 and declinations spaced by 5 arcminutes .",
    "thus each scan sampled a 0.5 degree declination band , and six scans were required to sample the whole area .",
    "the six scans were repeated for 10  hr , allowing each point in the surveyed area to be measured four or five times .",
    "the scan data were reduced to form the image shown in fig .",
    "as described in section [ aac ] , the atca flux scale is referred to a switched noise signal , the `` on - line @xmath54 measurement '' .",
    "the total intensity image was derived from those measurements .",
    "the full recovery of @xmath42 and @xmath43 required each point to be measured at different parallactic angles ( see section [ duq ] ) . in this case the south - west corner of the surveyed area was observed five times at parallactic angles of @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 degrees .",
    "figure [ velafig ] shows the resulting image of the vela supernova remnant .",
    "the peak total and polarized intensities are 1.3  k and 0.19  k respectively .",
    "the image has a resolution of 12 arcmin .",

    "in particular there is a good match of the polarization position angles between our results and those of @xcite .",
    "this indicates successful removal of the polarization offsets and background polarization which , as reported by @xcite is low relative to the polarization of the nebula itself .",
    "the high brightness of the vela region makes our test image less useful for assessing the ultimate sensitivity of the method and its ability to measure the weak cmbp foregrounds .",
    "the apparent noise in the @xmath42 and @xmath43 images of @xmath116 is dominated by the variations in polarized emission over the field .",
    "however , we have made preliminary observations of a region near @xmath117 ,  @xmath118 at high galactic latitude , which is expected to have low foreground emission .",
    "this is the region chosen for a number of cmbp measurements ( e.g. bar - sport , @xcite , boomerang - b2k , @xcite ) .",
    "we made the high - latitude observations using the same method described above for the vela supernova remnant and used a total bandwidth of @xmath119200  mhz .",
    "the results of the completed 5  ghz atca observations of this region will be the subject of a future report , in which we will compare them with equivalent measurements at lower frequencies .",
    "reducing the preliminary measurements to determine the sensitivity of a single telescope over a 1-s integration we find @xmath120 and @xmath121 , about a factor of 1.6 greater than expected from an ideal noise analysis .",
    "we can estimate the sensitivity to @xmath42 and @xmath43 for a survey area of @xmath122 with angular resolution @xmath123 using @xmath124 telescopes as @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the total integration time for the survey .",
    "for example a 10-hour observation using all six atca telescopes should yield @xmath127 for a survey area of 1 deg@xmath128 and a resolution of 12@xmath0 .",
    "this sensitivity would allow a 3@xmath59 detection of the expected 5  ghz signal of @xmath1190.2mk ( see @xcite for measurements of the polarized foreground at 2.3  ghz ) .",
    "we have described a novel method , and its demonstration , of using an existing interferometer array for wide field imaging .",
    "the interferometer mode of observing was used to derive the instrumental calibration and a single - dish observing mode with pointing offsets between the array elements was used for the wide field observing .",
    "we used the one correlated output ( @xmath45 ) to construct both @xmath42 and @xmath43 by observing all points in the imaged area at several parallactic angles .",
    "we recognise this as a potential technique for all - sky surveying or monitoring with future radio telescope arrays such as the square kilimetre array ( ska ) if the array elements are chosen to have limited sky coverage .",
    "this could relax the constraint that the ska must be built with wide - field elements and allow more conventional parabolic dishes to be used as the ska elements .",
