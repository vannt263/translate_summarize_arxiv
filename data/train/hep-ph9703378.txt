    "in the context of the study of qcd bound states via analytic methods a lot of interest has been devoted in the last ten years to the so - called feynman ",
    "schwinger formalism @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the main feature of the formalism is that it allows to write the 4-point green function ( at least in quenched approximation ) only in terms of a quantomechanical path integral over the quark trajectories times a functional depending on the average over the gauge fields of the wilson loop defined by the quark paths .",
    "moreover this functional can be expressed in terms of path derivatives of the averaged wilson loop @xcite .",
    "once we assume an analytic behaviour for the wilson loop , which up to now can be only given as an external input more or less _ motivated _ by qcd but not completely _ derived _ from qcd , the advantages of such a formulation are apparent .",
    "it permits numerical calculations @xcite which under some conditions can provide results faster and cheaper than a traditional lattice calculation .",
    "moreover it allows analytic estimates of physical interesting quantities . in @xcite",
    "it was possible in this way to obtain the complete heavy quark potential up to the order @xmath0 for different wilson loop assumptions and reproduce also the spin - dependent contributions of eichten and feinberg @xcite in the appropriate limits @xcite .",
    "we can say that the complete semirelativistic heavy quark - antiquark dynamics ( at least in the form of the interaction potential ) could be accessed only using this feynman ",
    "schwinger and path integral formalism .    on the other side",
    "the derivation of the relativistic quark - antiquark interaction is a long standing and important problem ( see @xcite for some report papers ) .",
    "all the calculations of phenomenologically relevant quantities such as the masses and the form factors for the light hadrons rely on the understanding of relativistic quark dynamics . in the last years",
    "a lot of effort has gone into the development of light cone hamiltonians on one side or bethe  salpeter - like and/or schwinger ",
    "dyson equations on the other .",
    "some criticism has been made to the latter approach essentially related to the loss of gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "indeed the manifestly gauge invariance of a physical state is a relevant concept when dealing with non - perturbative qcd dynamics .",
    "it is clear that the propagator of a coloured object could not be considered separately from the other coloured partners since it is connected by a string to it and this confinement dynamics dominates at large distances .",
    "another way to put the thing is to say that non - perturbatively the background fields and their effect on the quark dynamics are important .",
    "nevertheless we believe that when the gauge - invariance issue is properly addressed ( i. e. the average on all the vacuum fields in the amplitude is correctly handled ) the resulting effective interaction can be still treated in the framework of the bethe  salpeter equation and this supplies us with a formidable tool for the ( numerical ) evaluation of a huge number of physical quantities .",
    "one of the usually claimed limitations of the bethe ",
    "salpeter approach is that the confining part of the kernel is not known . in the literature",
    "it is widespreadly used a kernel made of a one - gluon ladder short range part plus a long range confining part suggested by a trivial relativistic generalization of the static linear potential .",
    "this amounts to consider a kernel depending only on the momentum transfer @xmath1 and with the form @xmath2 .",
    "the lorentz structure of the confining kernel is suggested to be a scalar again on the basis of the potential ( which actually pertains to a complete different dynamical region , we point out ) or simply phenomenologically treated as a vector which is chirally symmetric . however",
    ", all these assumptions run into great conceptual and concrete difficulties and it emerges that the kernel should be more complicate that a pure convolution type @xcite .",
    "another approach deals with bethe ",
    "salpeter and schwinger ",
    "dyson `` coupled '' equations with a kernel inspired by the lattice evaluation of the gluon propagator in a given gauge@xcite .",
    "the main motivation of this paper is to investigate the nature of the fully relativistic quark - antiquark dynamics in the form of a bethe ",
    "salpeter kernel working with the feynman ",
    "schwinger representation of the quark - antiquark gauge - invariant green function .",
    "the idea is to use this representation , that displays the complete dynamics factorized in the wilson loop , in order to enforce the information we have on the wilson loop behaviour directly on the bethe ",
    "salpeter kernel by means of a completely relativistic and non - perturbative procedure .",
    "this means that , starting with a form for the wilson loop we are able to establish the leading feynman graphs that make up the interaction kernel . moreover",
    "if we use a wilson loop behaviour containing the relevant part of the confining dynamics we will end up with the relevant part of the confining kernel . as it will become clear , the task is not simple in the case of quarks with spin .    in practice a good part of the paper",
    "is devoted to the technical setting up of the formalism . as an application we derive the leading binding contribution to the bethe ",
    "salpeter kernel in qed ( the one photon exchange graph ) .",
    "this supplies us with a technique and a definite language to apply in qcd .",
    "the up to now available assumptions on the behaviour of the wilson loop average seem not to allow easy extensions .",
    "therefore , we suggest the use of the fock ",
    "schwinger gauge in order to implement ( as in the qcd sum rules approach ) non - perturbative physics in the wilson loop , leaving the structure of the wilson loop average as close as possible to the qed one .",
    "we indicate the graphs relevant to the quark  antiquark binding that make up the interaction kernel .",
    "the paper has the following structure . in section 2 and section 3",
    "we derive the 2-point and 4-point green functions in the feynman  schwinger formalism . in section 4",
    "we apply the formalism to qed and in section 5 we discuss qcd and draw some conclusions .",
    "the aim of this section is to represent in terms of a quantomechanical path integral the fermion propagator @xmath3 of a particle @xmath4 in an external gauge field @xmath5 .",
    "we assume @xmath5 to be the non - abelian gauge field associated with the gluon in qcd .",

    "( [ peq ] ) in @xmath29 and taking in account that @xmath30 , we obtain the solution of eq .",

( [ dpath2 ] ) with ( [ ddef ] ) or ( [ ddef2 ] ) supplies us with a path integral representation of the fermion propagator in external field .",
    "we call this representation the feynman",
    " schwinger representation of the fermion propagator ( some historical references are given in @xcite ) .",
    "let us now consider a fermion - antifermion system .",
