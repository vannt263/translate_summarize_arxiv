    "in recent years the mathematical community of cosmologists has provided us with a multitude of new amazingly original models , not the least of which is the `` phantom fields '' concept , that ( among other things ) notably postulates the violation of the weak energy condition ( wec ) @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , where @xmath4 is the fluid density and @xmath5 is the pressure ( for recent reviews , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . such fields , as follows from quantum theory @xcite , should manifest themselves via the scalar field with the negative kinetic term .",
    "the thorough investigation asserts that fields with such a property should be anything but fundamental .",
    "still , one can not guarantee that no lagrangian with the negative kinetic terms would arise to serve as an _ effective _ model . and",
    "that , indeed , is exacly what happens in at least some of the supergravity models ( @xcite ) , as well as in the gravity theories with highest derivatives ( @xcite ) and even in the field string theory ( @xcite ) ( in the models describing the fermion nsr - string with regard for gso@xmath6-sector ( see also @xcite ) ) . lately",
    ", the `` phantom energy '' had even managed to penetrate into the domain of yet another `` exotic '' cosmological model  the brane theory ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) . .",
    "although most theoreticians believe that the phantom energy is nothing but an effective model , this shared notion as of yet remains to be backed up by anything rigorous .",
    "in fact , there are some evidence of quite the opposite .",
    "one particular example is the phenomena of  crossing of the phantom division line  , first discovered and discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and later interpreted in @xcite .",
    "this `` crossing '' is smooth and it is an inherent property of some of exact solutions of einstein equations .",
    "one can even argue that the smooth ( de)-phantomization is a sufficiently general property of einstein equations . therefore if we were ( following @xcite )",
    "guided by a belief that einstein equations for gravity are more fundamental than the concrete form of the lagrangian for other fields , then one can conclude that the `` crossing of the phantom division line '' is a new physically plausible fundamental property of gravitation .",
    "the particular interest to models with the phantom fields is caused by their prediction of so - called `` cosmic doomsday '' also known as big rip @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in case of the phantom energy we have @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "integration of the einstein - friedmann equation for the flat universe results in @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "we choose @xmath11 as the present time , @xmath12 cm and @xmath13 to be the present values of the scale factor and the density .",
    "there , if @xmath14 , we automatically get the big rip . .",
    "even though we are certainly uncomfortable with the conclusion that the universe might be doomed to be ( literally ) blown up in the big rip , there is simply not too many options available to avert or delay it .",
    "so far , we only know of four :    \\(i ) treating phantom energy as nothing more than an effective model ( see above ) ;    \\(ii ) using the quantum effects to delay the singularity ( @xcite ) ;    \\(iii ) introducing a new time variable such that the big rip singularity will be delayed indefinitely ( i.e. its occurrence will be pushed to @xmath15 ) ( @xcite ) ;    \\(iv ) the last and most intriguing of all : avoiding the big rip by means of another comparatively  big ",
    "cosmological effect  the so - called big trip ( see below ) .    in @xcite pedro f. gonzlez - daz , and jose a. jime - nez - madrid",
    "had introduced a hypothesis that a smooth exit from the phantom inflationary phase might actually be achievable provided one takes into account a multiversity scenario in which , right before reaching the big rip , the primordial phantom universe travels in time towards the future state , ultimately landing in a state where it will be filled with just usual radiation and no phantom fields .",
    "this transition had been called `` the big trip '' and it had been assumed it would take place due to a sort of anthropic principle , reserving the role of the final destination ( of the time transition ) for our current universe .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that if @xmath16 is a cosmological fluid s equation of state , then @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the throat radius of a morris - thorne wormhole and @xmath19 is the dimensionless quantity . according to @xcite",
    "we can choose @xmath20 ( this is true only if @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath22 then @xmath23 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the equation ( [ dotb ] ) describes the evolution of @xmath18 with respect to the phantom energy s accretion .",
    "integration of the ( [ dotb ] ) gives us @xmath24 therefore at @xmath25 we get @xmath26 .",
    "as we can see @xmath27 , and therefore this universe will indeed turn achronal well before the occurrence of the big rip . in accord to @xcite , in the process of phantom energy s accretion , for the time period starting right after the radius of the wormhole @xmath18 exceeds the scale factor @xmath28 and stretching up to @xmath29 , the wormhole becomes an active einstein - rosen bridge which can , in principle , be used to escape the big rip . .",
    "the notion of big trip has had its share of criticism - the article @xcite of faraoni is by far the most recent and thorough one among those expressing the doubts about the model .",
    "however , the objections of faraoni has been defended against in a response article @xcite , where the detailed answers to all the objections were given .",
    "it is interesting to note that even phantom models with no big rip singularity do admit wormhole solutions and hence allow for a possibility of big trip via such a wormhole ( @xcite ) .",
    "the description of big trip can be executed with help of wheeler - dewitt equation for wave function of the universe . to derive it authors of @xcite",
    "had introduced the spacetime manifold m for a flat frw universe with metric @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the lapse function arising due to foliation of the manifold @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the metric on the unit threesphere , and @xmath28 is the scale factor .",
    "next , they had assumed that the parameter of equation of state @xmath34 is time - dependant , but in such a way that at any moment of time we should have @xmath35 so the scalar curvature @xmath36 would have to be generalized by @xmath37 where `` dot '' indicates differentiation with respect to time .",
    "now consider the universe filled with scalar field @xmath38 with the lagrangian @xmath39 the action integral of the manifold @xmath32 with boundary @xmath40 will have the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the extrinsic curvature , @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the determinant of the general threemetric on a given hypersurface at the boundary @xmath40 .",
    "note , that herein we are using the natural system of units where @xmath45 . since @xmath46 one can integrate ( [ action ] ) over the spatial variables and substitute @xmath47 , thus reducing ( [ action ] ) to euclidean action : @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "then in the gauge where @xmath50 we have hamiltonian constraint @xmath51 and the momenta conjugate to @xmath52 and @xmath34 : @xmath53 however , the rules of quantum description calls for them to be replaced by the corresponding quantum operators : @xmath54 by making this change inside of the hamiltonian constraint we will finally obtain the wheeler - dewitt equation : @xmath55    for all intents and purposes , ( [ wdw ] ) is a hard nut to crack even for the simplest physically meaningful boundary conditions .",
    "however , as we shall see , this fortress has a hidden back door ; in fact , in the next section we are going to show that by employing the isospectral symmetries like the moutard and darboux transformations , it is possible to construct the exact solutions of ( [ wdw ] ) . or , to say it in a more rigorous way , there is a simple method of obtaining the  potentials  @xmath56 for which the equation ( [ wdw ] ) can be solved exactly .",
    "let us introduce two new independent variables @xmath57 and @xmath58 : @xmath59 and @xmath60 as @xmath61 we ll have @xmath62 and @xmath63 would imply @xmath64 .",
    "the case @xmath65 corresponds to a ds universe and when @xmath66 we automatically have a phantom equation of state .    by direct computation @xmath67 therefore , in terms of the new variables the equation ( [ wdw ] ) has the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 the equation ( [ wheeler - dewitt-1 ] ) admits the moutard transformation ( mt ) .",
    "namely , let @xmath70 and @xmath71 be two solutions of the ( [ wheeler - dewitt-1 ] ) : @xmath72 define a 1-form @xmath73 $ ] such that @xmath74= du\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial u } \\phi-\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial u } \\psi\\right)-dv\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial v } \\phi-\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial v } \\psi\\right ) , \\label{form}\\ ] ] and @xmath75=\\int_{\\gamma}d\\theta[\\psi;\\phi ] .",
    "\\label{theta}\\ ] ] note that since by definition both @xmath70 and @xmath71 are solutions of ( [ solutions ] ) , the one - form is closed , i.e. @xmath76}{\\partial u\\partial v}=\\frac{\\partial^2\\theta[\\psi;\\phi]}{\\partial v\\partial u},\\ ] ] and thus the shape of the contour of integration @xmath77 is irrelevant .",
    "the mt has the form @xmath78}{\\phi } , \\label{psi1}\\ ] ] @xmath79 it means that @xmath80 it is worth pointing out at this step that @xmath81 rather then zero .",
    "the moutard transformation ( [ psi1 ] ) , ( [ phi1 ] ) , ( [ u1 ] ) can be iterated several times , and the result can be expressed via corresponding pfaffian forms .",
    "let @xmath82 , therefore @xmath83 with arbitrary functions @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . using ( [ u1 ] )",
    "we get @xmath88 using ( [ psi1 ] ) we can calculate the solution of equation ( [ dressed ] ) with the potential ( [ dress - u1 ] ) , that would contain two arbitrary functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 : @xmath89 where @xmath90 @xmath91 the second solution ( without arbitrary functions ) is given by the formula ( [ phi1 ] ) : @xmath92 one simple yet interesting example follows if one takes @xmath93 in this case the expression ( [ uh ] ) describes the normalizable wave function : @xmath94 unlike the original solution @xmath71 , which does not belong to @xmath95 for any ( non - zero ) functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "furthermore , the new solution clearly has a maximum at @xmath96 , i.e. at @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( which also happens to be a saddle point of potential @xmath99 ) .",
    "thus , if we operate in framework of this model we would have to find ourselves with large probability in a dust universe with a finite value of scale factor .",
    "* example 2 .",
    "dressing of the ds universe *    let @xmath100 , so @xmath101 .",
    "the solution of the ( [ wheeler - dewitt-1 ] ) has a general form @xmath102 with an arbitrary integrable function @xmath103 .",
    "let us consider a special case : @xmath104 with real - valued @xmath105 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , let @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "then @xmath109 and we can write the result of the moutard dressing as @xmath110 and the density @xmath111 as @xmath112 note , that in this case the maximal probability distribution will not be localized at one point in the @xmath113-phase space , but instead we have a continuous curve @xmath114 that solves the equation @xmath115 .",
    "these examples show that , unless we have a very special case ( like @xmath82 ) , the eigenfunctions of the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ wdw ] ) would in general have not just one but many ( possibly infinitely many ) maximums in the @xmath113 space , thus leaving us with the burden of choosing the appropriate @xmath34 that the universe should attain after the big trip . of course , there exist different possibilities for such a choice  for example , using the final anthropic principle or restricting ourselves to a discrete set of possible values of @xmath116 ( that is treated as a quantum - mechanical parameter ) ; nevertheless , it is also possible that such a freedom might actually imply the possible deficiency of the equation itself .",
    "in fact , as we shall see below , once we take into account possibility of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , the resulting equation would appear to favor one special value of @xmath34 , namely : @xmath119 .",
    "the standard definition of a big trip implies that it is a cosmological event thought to occur in the future during which the entire universe is engulfed inside of a gigantic wormhole ( hence , the term `` big '' ! ) , traveling through it along space and time .",
    "however , it would appear that yet another `` big '' cosmological event might be possible ; an event that , by analogy , we would like to call a `` big meeting '' .    in order to get to it",
    ", we will use the approach from @xcite with alteration : we would not impose the restrictions @xmath120 and @xmath121 . as before , we are assuming that @xmath122 . differentiating the einstein - friedmann equation @xmath123 with respect to @xmath124 will get us a different expression for the scalar curvature @xmath125 : @xmath126 where @xmath127 the corresponding euclidian action is @xmath128 , \\label{eaction2}\\ ] ] where @xmath129 introducing the momenta according to ( [ momenta ] ) and redefining the ( classical ) hamiltonian via @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath52 and @xmath34 will provide us with a generalized wheeler - dewitt equation : @xmath132 the wde ( [ wd6 ] ) is different from the wde ( [ wdw ] ) , obtained in @xcite since the absence of condition @xmath120 has made a further simplification of the actions ( [ action ] ) , ( [ eaction ] ) not possible . as we shall see , it is this new equation ( [ wd6 ] ) that results in a new effect  the `` big meeting '' .",
    "first at all , lets consider the special case @xmath119 .",
    "the right hand side of the ( [ wd6 ] ) will be equal to zero .",
    "moreover , we will have @xmath133 , and thus @xmath134 which reduces the wde ( [ wd6 ] ) to @xmath135 using the power series expansion of function @xmath136 around the point @xmath137 @xmath138 and substituting it into ( [ uh7 ] ) would result in @xmath139 , and thus in @xmath140 on the other hand , equation ( [ uh7 ] ) is invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath141 for arbitrary ( differentiable ) functions @xmath142 . substituting ( [ 9 ] ) into the ( [ 8 ] ) and choosing @xmath143 at @xmath119 we get without loss of generality @xmath144 therefore ,",
    "in the case of general position , for any * fixed * @xmath52 the function @xmath145 has an extremum at @xmath119 .",
    "moreover , the condition that function @xmath70 has to be normalizable implies that the probability distribution @xmath146 for any given value of the scale factor has a peak at @xmath119 . in order to prove this lets return to equation ( [ wd6 ] ) . consider its solutions that satisfy the property @xmath147 for any given @xmath52 and some fixed @xmath148 .",
    "then @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) and at point @xmath151 : @xmath152 @xmath153 besides @xmath154 substituting ( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) into the ( [ wd6 ] ) we get @xmath155 using ( [ 15 ] ) one can conclude that either @xmath1 or we have to satisfy the following equation @xmath156 if @xmath121 the general solution of the ( [ 16 ] ) has the form @xmath157 where @xmath158 are arbitrary constants , @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the bessel functions of the first and second kind correspondingly .",
    "this function has to be normalizable : @xmath162 which implies that @xmath163 . substituting ( [ solution17 ] ) into the ( [ 14 ] ) results in @xmath164 which can only be satisfied for arbitrary @xmath52 if and only if @xmath165 and @xmath166 is the solution of the equation @xmath167 but if @xmath165 then the wave function @xmath168 ( and the same will be the case for the density @xmath4 ( see ( [ wd6 ] ) ) ) .",
    "but the only normalizable function of this type is @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , the only possible non - trivial solution that comply with ( [ extr11 ] ) in framework of normalizable wave functions of the universe correspond to the case @xmath1 .",
    "the end of the proof_.    now lets say a few words on account of possible existence of other peaks @xmath170 on the graph of solutions of the ( [ wd6 ] ) that satisfy @xmath171 and @xmath172_{m_*}>0 . \\label{det18}\\ ] ] surprisingly , it is possible to eradicate these extrema . to show it , one should take into account the dimensionless variables in expressions like @xmath173 . keeping in mind that our universe was born via big trip from the paternal universe with scale factor @xmath174",
    ", we have to replace @xmath175 . on the other hand",
    ", we expect that right after the big trip the initial value of the scale factor @xmath176 will be @xmath177 .",
    "lets consider such a universe with @xmath178 . in order to estimate the probability to find this universe just after the big trip ( that is with @xmath179 ) one must use the wde ( [ wd6 ] ) which reduces to a simple form @xmath180",
    "if @xmath181 then ( see ( [ det18 ] ) ) @xmath182 and we have no extremum at all .    note one interesting feature of a universe with @xmath119 . if @xmath119 the solution for scale factor has a simple form @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath185 are constants . for the expanding universe @xmath186 .",
    "it is possible to join the metric with this scale factor to any frw universe at any time in the expanding phase .",
    "consider for example a flat de sitter universe : @xmath187 where @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "the matching conditions for arbitrary @xmath190 require continuity of the scale factor together with its first derivatives :    @xmath191    @xmath192 for @xmath185 we have @xmath193 .",
    "therefore the joining is trivial : the continuity condition of continuity of @xmath194 uniquely determines the parameter @xmath184 and the continuity condition of @xmath28 does the same for the constant @xmath185 .",
    "the simple method based on moutard transformation for constructing exact solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ wdw ] ) is presented .",
    "a direct application of this method has demonstrated that in general , unless some kind of additional restriction on the possible values of @xmath34 is imposed , we would have to face a problem of somehow choosing a suitable @xmath34 from ( in general ) infinite set of possibilities whenever we try to describe the universe after the big trip .",
    "however , it appears that should one consider the generalized form of wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ wd6 ] ) instead , the conclusion would be drastically different . in this case",
    "the probability distribution has the peak(s ) at @xmath119 for any @xmath52 provided that we consider the universe right after big trip . by analogy with the `` big trip ''",
    "this result can be called a `` big meeting '' .",
    "what it means is that in multiverse the vast majority of universes experiencing the big trip should end up in a state with @xmath119 right afterwards ."
