    "evolutionary game theory [ 1 ] is one of the important topics in mathematics .",
    "also it has many applications in biology , sociology and economics .",
    "generally a game consists of a group of players ( of which two players at each game ) are interacting with each other obtaining payoffs .",
    "every player is allowed to choose some strategies , according to some rules .",
    "there are many different types of games .",
    "each of them has its own rules , strategies , properties and applications .",
    "evolutionarily stable strategy ( ess ) [ 1 ] is an important concept in population dynamics .",
    "consider a population in which each individual adopts one of @xmath0 possible strategies ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "a strategy @xmath2 is ess if for all @xmath3 ( yet close to it ) , then    1 .",
    "@xmath4 ; or 2 .",
    "if @xmath5 , then @xmath6 ,    where @xmath7 is the @xmath8 payoff matrix .    recently , sato and crutchfield [ 2 ] have introduced a new formulation that is corresponding to mistakes or losing memory .",
    "our aim is to study sato - crutchfield formulation both analytically and numerically .",
    "stability and persistence of the solutions are studied .",
    "the persistence of a dynamical system [ 3 ] is defined as follows:*definition 1 : * a dynamical system is persistent if all cases where all @xmath9 lead to @xmath10 + also , we study the sato - crutchfield formulation for some different types of two - player games including hawk - dove ( hd ) , prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) and the battle of the sexes games [ 1 ] . the sato - crutchfield formulation is shown not to affect the ess of the ordinary games .",
    "but in some limit , choosing a strategy becomes random independent of the rules of the game and the initial conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in section 2 , the sato - crutchfield formulation is explained . both analytical and numerical results are added .",
    "the sato - crutchfield equations is applied to hd game in section 3 .",
    "also the effect on ess is studied .",
    "section 4 is devoted for studying the sato - crutchfield for pd game and some of its modifications . in section 5 ,",
    "the sato - crutchfield equations are introduced to the battle of the sexes .",
    "some conclusions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "recently sato and crutchfield [ 2 ] have studied the dynamics of learning in multiagent systems , where the agents use reinforcement learning .",
    "they showed that , although the agents are not directly interacting with each other , a collective game arises between them through their interaction with environment .",
    "such interactions can be modelled via replicator type equations .",
    "consider two agents @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 possible actions , let @xmath14 be a measure of the probability that the agent @xmath15 will take action @xmath16 at time @xmath17 .",
    "sato and crutchfield have shown that @xmath18 satisfy the following equations    @xmath19 + \\alpha _ { 1}u_{i}\\sum_{j}u_{j}\\ln \\left ( \\frac{u_{j}}{% u_{i}}\\right ) , \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{i}}{\\mathrm{d}t}=v_{i}\\beta _ { 2}\\left [ ( bu)_{i}-vbu\\right ] + \\alpha _ { 2}v_{i}\\sum_{j}v_{j}\\ln \\left ( \\frac{v_{j}}{% v_{i}}\\right ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 and @xmath20 are payoff ( reward ) matrices for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and @xmath21 are nonnegative constants . if @xmath22,@xmath23then one regains the standard asymmetric replicator equations [ 1,4 ] .",
    "we will comment on the case @xmath24 . for simplicity only the symmetric case will be considered @xmath25 .",
    "rescaling time to set @xmath26 , the system becomes    @xmath27    restricting to the region @xmath28 , then**corollary 1 : * * bounded solutions of the system ( 3 ) are persistent.this means that even bad strategies will be adopted by some agents . to study this",
    "analytically assume @xmath29 . in the case",
    "that @xmath30 , it is known that the best strategy is @xmath31 so for small @xmath32 , we find    @xmath33    the solution ( 4 ) is asymptotically stable if    @xmath34    the persistence of all strategies can be understood intuitively by realizing that @xmath35 means memory decay [ 2 ] .",
    "this implies that some individuals may not know which is the best strategy hence they choose the bad strategy .",
    "furthermore as @xmath32 increases , @xmath36 become close to each other , since more agents lose their memory .",
    "this agrees with the numerical simulations shown in fig .",
    "both @xmath37 and @xmath38 go to @xmath39 for large @xmath32 . at this point",
    "agents chose their strategies randomly without any regard to previous experiences .",
    "the hawk - dove game [ 1 ] is a two - player game , where each player is allowed to use the hawk strategy ( h ) or the dove strategy ( d ) .",
    "it has many biological and economic applications .",
    "the payoff matrix is given as follows    @xmath40 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is the value of gain and @xmath42 is the cost of fight .",
    "the max - min solution of von neumann et al .",
    "[ 5 ] is to follow the d strategy for @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath44 , then the max - min solution is to follow the h policy .",
    "but this solution is not evolutionary stable , since a mutant adopting h strategy will gain much , this will encourage others to adopt the h policy .",
    "this will continue till the fraction of adopting the h policy ( @xmath37 ) becomes large enough to make the payoffs of both strategies equal , thus    @xmath45    applying the sato - crutchfield equations to hd game , the replicator equation becomes    @xmath46 + \\alpha u_{1}u_{2}\\ln \\left ( \\frac{u_{2}}{% u_{1}}\\right ) , \\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is the d density .",
    "this case is numerically investigated for various values for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , see fig .",
    "( 2 ) for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the system is updated for @xmath50 time steps .",

    "therefore , for large @xmath32 , agents choose their strategies ( h or d ) randomly with equal probabilities .",
    "this behavior is independent on the initial conditions .",
    "sato - crutchfield formulation does not affect the ess .",

    "beginning from nonzero values for @xmath36 and @xmath58 , and for @xmath59 , the system always evolves to a state at which @xmath60 . at this point , selecting a strategy becomes random with equal probabilities .",
    "but beginning from a zero value for the density of a strategy , it will not grow through the population .",
    "the existence of cooperation in a group of selfish individuals is an interesting problem in mathematics and social sciences .",
    "one of the models of this phenomenon is the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) game [ 1 ] . in this case",
    "the available strategies are to cooperate ( c ) or to defect ( d ) .",
    "the payoff matrix @xmath7 is @xmath61 $ ] , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 . for simplicity",
    "we take @xmath64 @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "the standard solution gives the unrealistic conclusion that players should not cooperate .",
    "however cooperation has been shown to be a solution if the game is modified into iterated pd , or pd on the lattice , or memory pd [ 6,7 ] . recently",
    "another modification is given [ 8 ] , where a third strategy is introduced so the allowed strategies are c , d and loner ( l ) .",
    "in this case , the payoff matrix is given as @xmath66\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we call this game pdl game .",
    "the sato - crutchfield equations for the pd game are @xmath69 where @xmath37 is the defectors density and @xmath47 is the cooperators density . it is known that for @xmath30 , the asymptotically stable strategy is ( d ) i.e. @xmath70 .",
    "this has caused the following question to arise : how can cooperation exist in a population of defectors ( selfish population ) ?",
    "sato - crutchfield equations propose a new answer .",
    "cooperation may arise due to memory loss which is equivalent to mistakes . but starting from a small number of cooperators in a defectors population what is the asymptotic ratio of cooperators ?",
    "for very small positive @xmath32 e.g. @xmath71 it is straightforward to see that the equilibrium solution is @xmath72 .",
    "this solution is asymptotically stable for very small @xmath32 .",
    "but as @xmath32 increases the solution approaches @xmath73(as we have argued before ) .",
    "thus in sato - crutchfield equations a small number of cooperators in a population of defectors will increase to reach @xmath74 of the population for @xmath32 not too large , as shown in fig .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath75 where it is known that cooperation will eventually tend to zero .",
    "this shows the significant change between sato - crutchfield system and the corresponding replicator one .    applying sato - crutchfield equations to the pdl game ,",
    "one gets    @xmath76 , \\\\ \\frac{1}{u_{2}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u_{2}}{\\mathrm{d}t}=u_{2}(1-u_{2})-\\sigma ( 1-u_{1}-u_{2})(u_{1}+u_{2})-bu_{1}u_{2 } \\\\",

    "it is direct to see that @xmath78 is a neutral equilibrium for the system ( 13 ) . for @xmath35 ,",
    "all strategies coexist . solving the system ( 13 ) numerically for @xmath79 ,",
    "we get the fixed point @xmath80 .",
    "this confirms our conclusion that sato - crutchfield equations is an interesting approach to introduce cooperation in prisoner s dilemma type games . as @xmath32 increases",
    ", the choice between the three strategies becomes random with equal probabilities .",
    "therefore @xmath81 , @xmath38 and @xmath58 tend to @xmath82 .",
    "recently , the war between the sexes was emphasizes as being important [ 9 ] .",
    "the battle of the sexes [ 10 ] is an asymmetric game that simulates the conflict between males and females concerning their respective shares in their parental investment .",
    "the female has two strategies coy or willing ( fast ) while the male can be either faithful or philanderer .",
    "the male ( female ) payoff matrix @xmath83 is gives as @xmath84 , \\;\\;b=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & 5 \\\\ 3 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ] .\\ ] ]    here we are applying the sato - crutchfield formulation to the battle of the sexes .",
    "the sato - crutchfield equations for the battle of the sexes are    @xmath85    there is a unique internal homogeneous equilibrium solution @xmath86 which is stable ; but not asymptotically stable .",
    "therefore in the case @xmath87 , one gets oscillations . for the case @xmath88 , we get**proposition ( 1 ) : * * the equilibrium solution of the system ( 14 ) is @xmath89 ,  @xmath90 ,  and it is asymptotically stable @xmath91.this shows that in this case there is a significant change between sato - crutchfield system and the corresponding replicator one .",
