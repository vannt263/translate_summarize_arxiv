    "originally , extra spatial dimensions were proposed to address the mass scale hierarchies affecting the standard model ( sm ) , and requiring parameter fine tuning , in particular the so - called gauge hierarchy @xmath1  tev .",
    "these scenarios predict the existence of heavy new particles , or excitations of the sm particles , that could be revealed as narrow peaks in cross sections measured at the lhc if their masses were within the experimental kinematical reach .",
    "observability will depend on the values of these heavy ` resonance ' masses and coupling constants to the sm matter , that assure sufficiently high event rates .",
    "actually , in this regard , the _ discovery reach _ on an individual scenario is the maximum value of the corresponding resonance mass , @xmath2 , for which the peak can be observed .",
    "however , different non - standard models can give , for appropriate values of their parameters , peaks at the same @xmath3 and the same number of events under the peak .",
    "accordingly , one defines for any non - standard scenario an _ identification _ mass range ( of course , included within the discovery range ) , where it can be unambiguously discriminated as the one really underlying the peak , by excluding the other models as potential sources of that same peak .",
    "the determination of the spin of a discovered heavy resonance is , therefore , crucial for its identification .",
    "we will here discuss the identification of the spin-2 graviton excitation predicted by the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model with one warped extra dimension @xcite , against the spin-1 and the spin-0 hypotheses for a heavy neutral resonance discovered in dilepton and diphoton inclusive production at the lhc : @xmath4 we will model the spin-1 hypothesis by the @xmath5s predicted by extended electroweak gauge symmetries @xcite , and the spin-0 one by the sneutrinos ( @xmath6 ) envisaged by @xmath7-parity violating susy extensions of the sm @xcite . `",
    "confusion ' domains of their respective parameter spaces allowed by current experimental constraints exist , in which ` @xmath8-channel ' exchanges of the above mentioned particles can in the process ( [ proc ] ) produce narrow peaks in the dilepton invariant mass with the same values of mass and event rates .",
    "therefore , for the spin-2 hypothesis discrimination against the two alternative ones , more detailed information must be supplied , i.e. , that embodied in the characteristic angular distributions of the different scenarios .",
    "the basic observable for a heavy resonance discovery at an invariant dilepton ( or diphoton ) mass @xmath3 ( with in our case @xmath9 denoting graviton , @xmath5 and sneutrino , respectively ) is the production cross section governing the rate of events @xmath10 and the differential angular distribution @xmath11 in eqs .",
    "( [ totcr ] ) and ( [ diffcr ] ) , @xmath12 and @xmath13 define the lepton - quark ( or photon - quark ) angle in the dilepton ( or diphoton ) center - of - mass and the dilepton rapidity , respectively , and cuts on phase space due to detector acceptance are indicated . for integration over the full phase space ,",
    "the limits would be @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 the lhc collider center - of - mass energy .",
    "furthermore , @xmath17 is an invariant mass bin around @xmath2 , reflecting the detector energy resolution , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite . to evaluate the number @xmath18 of resonant signal events ,",
    "these equations must be multiplied by the time - integrated luminosity , for which we will take 100 and 10 @xmath0 , and by the foreseen reconstruction efficiencies ( 90% for both electrons and muons @xcite ) . also , the typical experimental cuts on rapidities and transverse momenta must be applied ( @xmath19  gev and @xmath20 for both leptons ) .",
    "finally , with @xmath21 the number of ` background ' events in the @xmath17 bin , determined by the sm predictions , the criterion @xmath22 or 10  events , whichever is larger , will be adopted as the minimum signal for the peak discovery . of course , the determination of discovery and identification reaches on the different non - standard models requires the expression of eqs .",
    "( [ totcr ] ) and ( [ diffcr ] ) in terms of convolutions of the pertinent partonic cross sections times parton distribution functions , and for the latter we will choose the cteq6 ones of ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath23-dependence of the cross sections for graviton , @xmath5 and sneutrino exchanges are different , the discrimination of spin-2 from spin-1 and spin-0 might be attempted by the ` direct ' comparison of eq .",
    "( [ diffcr ] ) for the three hypotheses @xcite .    in practice , due to the completely symmetric @xmath24 initial state at the lhc , the determination of the sign of @xmath23 from the measured events may not be fully unambiguous .",
    "an observable potentially avoiding this ambiguity , and which we adopt to perform the angular analysis , is the @xmath23-evenly integrated center - edge angular asymmetry @xcite : @xmath25 \\frac{{\\rm d } \\sigma}{{\\rm d } z}\\ , { \\rm d } z.\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ ace ] ) , @xmath26 defines the separation between the `` center '' and the `` edge '' angular regions , and is _ a priori _ arbitrary .",
    "however , its actual value can be `` optimized '' in the numerical analysis .",
    "a further potential advantage of @xmath27 is that , as consisting of ratios of integrated cross sections , it could be less sensitive to systematic uncertainties , such as those stemming from particular choices of parton distributions , @xmath28-factor values , etc .. defined along these lines , in terms of differences between lepton and antilepton pseudorapidities , has been proposed for model identification in ref .",
    "also , the possibility of identifying the graviton excitation spin-2 from the azimuthal angular dependence of the graviton+jet inclusive production has been explored in @xcite . ]",
    "this simplest version consists of one warped extra dimension , @xmath13 , two three - dimensional branes placed at a compactification relative distance @xmath29 in @xmath13 , and the specific 5-d metric @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the usual minkowski tensor and @xmath32 is a dimensionful constant .",
    "the sm fields are assumed to be localized to the so - called tev brane , while gravity can propagate in the full 5-d space , in particular on the other brane , the planck brane , in which the effective 4-d mass scale is @xmath33 .",
    "with @xmath34 the 5-d mass scale , analogously related to the cubic root of the 5-d gravitational constant , einstein s equations imply the relation @xmath35 , and the basic ` naturalness ' assumption imposed on the model , to avoid further fine tunings , is @xmath36 .",
    "the geometry of eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) implies that the mass spectrum on the planck brane , of the order of @xmath37 tev , can for @xmath38 be exponentially ` warped ' down to the tev brane where sm particles live , by many orders of magnitude , namely , to the scale @xmath39 tev .",
    "the appealing consequence is then that gravitational effects can occur in the reach of supercolliders , such as the lhc . indeed",
    ", junction conditions at the brane @xmath13-positions imply , for the above value of @xmath40 , the existence of a tower of spin-2 graviton excitations , @xmath41 , with a specifically spaced mass spectrum @xmath42 of order tev ( @xmath43 are here the roots of @xmath44 ) .",
    "their couplings to the sm particles are only @xmath45-suppressed ( not @xmath46 ) : @xmath47 t^{\\mu\\nu}(x),\\ ] ] and their signature may appear at lhc . in ( [ interaction ] )",
    ", @xmath48 is the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath49 denotes the zero - mode , ordinary , graviton .",
    "the commonly chosen independent rs model parameters are the mass of the lowest graviton excitation , @xmath50 , and the ` universal ' , dimensionless , coupling @xmath51 ( the scale @xmath52 is then a derived quantity ) .",
    "theoretically ` natural ' ranges of these parameters are @xmath53 and @xmath54 tev @xcite . with @xmath55 and @xmath56 a number of the order of @xmath57 , narrow graviton resonances are expected for such small values of @xmath58 .",
    "tevatron 95% cl limits on @xmath59 @xcite range from @xmath60 gev ( @xmath61 ) to @xmath62 tev ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "thus , due to the high allowed values of @xmath59 , the discovery could be limited to the lightest @xmath64 and the verification of the predicted mass pattern hardly feasible , so that the spin-2 determination through the angular analysis becomes a crucial test of the model .    for dilepton production , the leading order subprocesses @xmath65 and @xmath66",

    "( [ diffg ] ) and ( [ aceg ] ) are quite transparent in showing the characteristic @xmath23 ( and @xmath76 ) dependencies for the spin-2 graviton , but hold in that form only for @xmath14 .",
    "this fact turns out to be numerically unimportant at the optimal value of @xmath76 where the @xmath27 analysis is performed , and the final results take into account all phase space cuts foreseen by the experiment .",

    "( [ diffg ] ) and ( [ aceg ] ) with the same significance of the notations can be written as @xcite : @xmath80 and @xmath81 + \\epsilon_g^g \\left[-1 + \\frac{5}{8}z^ { * } + \\frac{5}{4}{z^{*}}^{3 } + \\frac{1}{8}{z^{*}}^{5}\\right].\\ ] ] it turns out that in this case the @xmath74-initiated subprocess is the dominant , with a shape peaked at @xmath82 similar to the sm background but by far overwhelming it for the order tev values of @xmath59 we here are interested in . clearly , the interest of the diphoton channel is that spin-1@xmath83 leaves only the spin-2 and spin-0 hypotheses , and that the ratio @xmath84 is predicted @xcite .",
    "a current field of interest is the extension of the simplest rs model described here to the case of sm fermions and gauge bosons also propagating in the full 5-d space , this could provide an approach also to other mass hierarchies such as , for example , the fermion mass hierarchy .",
    "a complicated phenomenology then emerges , in which both fermions and gauge bosons are accompanied by high ( and very high ) mass excitations , see for instance the review in ref .",

    "different extended electroweak gauge symmetries , those couplings are fixed theoretically , so that only @xmath86 would remain as a free parameter .",
    "this is the case of the @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 models , and the `` sequential '' @xmath92 model with the same couplings as the sm ( details can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "current tevatron lower limits ( 95% cl ) on these @xmath5 masses range from 878 gev to 1.03 tev , depending on the model @xcite .",
    "actually , the leading - order partonic subprocess @xmath93 leads to the same form of the @xmath23-even angular distribution as the sm , therefore to the same @xmath27 for all models : @xmath94 \\label{diffzprime}\\ ] ] and @xmath95 our @xmath27-based estimates for exclusion of the spin-1 @xmath5 hypothesis will , accordingly , have a considerable degree of @xmath5 model - independence .    * sneutrino exchange *    the spin-0 character of the resonant subprocess @xmath96 , leading to a peak at @xmath97 , manifests itself in a flat angular distribution @xcite : @xmath98 @xmath99 besides @xmath100 , the cross section is proportional to the @xmath7-parity violating product @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the sneutrino leptonic branching ratio and @xmath103 the relevant sneutrino coupling to the @xmath104 quarks .",

    "there are wide domains in @xmath2 and coupling constant values allowed by current experimental limits where the scenarios described above predict the same peaks in @xmath109 with the same numbers of events , so that they can not be distinguished from each other on the basis of the event rates only .    to proceed with the spin - identifying angular analysis",
    ", we suppose that a peak at @xmath3 is discovered in process ( [ proc ] ) , and assume that it is consistent with a spin-2 rs graviton ( in which case @xmath110 ) .",
    "to evaluate the domain in the ( @xmath111 ) plane , where the competitor spin-1 and spin-0 hypotheses with the same number of events under the @xmath112 peak as the graviton hypothesis can be excluded , hence the spin-2 hypothesis can be established , we look at the ` distances ' among models : @xmath113 we adopt a simple - minded @xmath114-like criterion , where the deviations ( [ deltagsv ] ) are compared to the expected statistical uncertainty @xmath115 pertinent to the rs model ( systematic uncertainties can also be included ) .",

    "the desired _ identification _",
    "domain in ( @xmath111 ) is determined by the condition @xmath117 for both the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 models , with @xmath118 a critical number that specifies the confidence level ( 3.84 for 95% cl ) . of course , eq .",
    "( [ deltagsv ] ) depends on the value of @xmath76 , but it turns out that the choice @xmath119 is ` optimal ' in maximizing the sensitivity of the numerical analysis to the rs graviton .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the 5-@xmath120 discovery domains and the 95% identification domains for lhc luminosities of 10 and 100 @xmath0 ( @xmath121 combined ) , and the ` theoretically favoured ' restriction @xmath122 tev taken into account . specifically : the area at the left of the line `` @xmath72 '' is the discovery domain for the lowest - lying rs graviton resonance ; the area at the left of the `` @xmath123 '' curve is the exclusion domain of the spin-1 hypothesis ; finally , in the area at the left of the `` @xmath124 '' line the spin-0 ( and , as one can see , forcefully the spin-1 ) hypothesis can be excluded .",
    "therefore , the _ identification _ domain where both spin-1 and spin-0 hypotheses can be excluded and the spin-2 established is the intersection of the `` @xmath124 '' area with the @xmath122  tev one , i.e. , above that curve .",
    "the allowed domain to the right of the dashed `` oblique corrections '' line is qualitatively determined by a fit to the oblique ew parameters @xcite , but the condition dramatically restricting the discovery domains to the dashed areas , if literally applied , is the @xmath52 bound .",
