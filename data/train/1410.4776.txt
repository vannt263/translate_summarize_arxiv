    "coherent emission from an ensemble of scatterers ( such as electric dipoles ) can result in the scatterers behaving as a collective rather than independently @xcite .",
    "such `` cooperative '' emission can lead to large frequency shifts off - resonance , and to dramatically modified decay rates ( superradiance and subradiance ) @xcite .",
    "this has been realized experimentally in a number of systems , including ions @xcite , nuclei @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , nanoplasmonics @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite and both room temperature @xcite and cold atoms @xcite .",
    "other related cooperative phenomena include highly directional scattering @xcite , excitation localization @xcite , and modified optical transmission and scattering @xcite .",
    "cooperative emission is caused by the interference of radiation from individual scatterers , and periodic spacing between neighboring dipoles can therefore lead to a significantly enhanced cooperative response @xcite .",
    "coherent scattering between two - level dipoles maps exactly onto a spin exchange description @xcite ; consequently , there is a unifying crossover between cooperative light scattering and interacting spin systems .",
    "spin lattices are a subject of widespread contemporary interest , and manifest in such diverse systems as quantum degenerate gases @xcite , polar molecules @xcite and cold atoms @xcite in optical lattices , and electric and magnetic multipoles in plasmonic nanostructures @xcite .",
    "an understanding of the cooperative behavior in these driven - dissipative systems could open the door to a wide range of applications ( e.g.  shifts and lifetimes in optical lattice clocks @xcite , narrow linewidth superradiant lasers @xcite , subwavelength light control @xcite and many body spin models @xcite ) .",
    "one particular 2d lattice geometry associated with a range of exotic spin phenomena is the trihexagonal ( kagome ) lattice .",
    "examples include spin ice and geometric frustration @xcite , photonic flat bands and band gaps @xcite , low - loss transmission through hollow - core photonic crystal fibers @xcite , and non - integer mott phases in optical lattices @xcite . in this work",
    "we show that the semiregular geometry of kagome lattices makes it possible to straightforwardly populate cooperative states associated with dramatic interference line - shapes and strongly subradiant modes .",
    "we calculate the cooperative shifts and decay rates in periodic 2d monolayers of interacting dipoles , using a model closely following that of @xcite .",
    "we treat each dipole as a weakly - driven damped oscillator , with electric dipole moment @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) proportional to the total incident electric field @xmath2 and the polarizability @xmath3 . the dipole positions @xmath4 form a 2d lattice in the @xmath5 plane with nearest - neighbor spacing @xmath6 . in this work",

    "each dipole also radiates a secondary electric field , hence the total field felt by the @xmath20th dipole , @xmath21 , is the sum of the applied driving field @xmath16 and the fields @xmath22 radiated from all other dipoles .",

    "we highlight a similar - looking mode ( yellow squares ) which at small @xmath6 is superradiant and red - shifted .",
    "this is the spin analogue of the dicke symmetric state @xcite with @xmath76 , which we will later show corresponds to having all spins aligned with the field , i.e.  a ferroelectric - like state .",
    "similarly , each lattice exhibits strongly subradiant modes ( blue circles ) which , like the `` yellow squares '' mode , are shifted off - resonance as @xmath77 , due to the @xmath78 small @xmath79 behavior of @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gtensor ] ) @xcite . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) and [ fig:1](b ) we see that the overall behavior of the square lattices is broadly similar , barring the introduction of more modes in [ fig:1](b ) .",

    "[ fig:1](a , b ) , with lattice spacing @xmath66 . for the small @xmath82 lattice ( a )",
    ", we observe one strong broad red - shifted mode and one strong narrow blue - shifted mode ( as well as a few much weaker modes ) . where the two modes overlap there is a strong asymmetric resonance in the cross - section line - shape .",
    "this fano - like resonance is due to the interference terms that appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : extcrosssection ] ) and is a direct consequence of the non - zero overlap between mode vectors ( the eigenvector non - orthogonality ) . in the power spectrum for @xmath65 [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ] , we observed that adding more dipoles to the square lattice resulted in many strong narrow modes appearing at small lattice spacings .",
    "these modes are also visible in the extinction cross - section [ fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) ] , however their relative contribution to the total line - shape is much weaker . as in the @xmath82 case , the line - shape for @xmath67 when @xmath65 is dominated by one broad mode , but the asymmetric fano resonances resulting from overlap with the narrower modes are much smaller . in a real experiment , with associated lattice imperfections or noise , these weak narrow modes will wash out ( see section [ sec : latticeimperfections ] ) .    for a kagome lattice geometry however , we observe two very strong modes at lattice spacing @xmath83 . as in the @xmath84 structure in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) , these result in a distinctive interference line - shape in the extinction cross - section @xmath56 [ fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) ] .",
    "similar to the @xmath85 square lattice case , most of the narrow modes prominent in the power spectrum [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) ] are relatively weak in the extinction . the separate mode highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c , f ) with triangular pink markers remains significant , however , and interference between this mode ( labeled ii ) and the broader strong mode ( labeled i ) results in a line - shape similar in appearance to those of cooperative and dipole eit @xcite . in these systems , interferences between different excitation modes ( typically one narrow and one broad ) result in transparency where otherwise extinction would be expected",
    "this is analogous to conventional eit , but here the excited states are the cooperative states of an ensemble of 2-level scatterers , as opposed to multiple states in a single scatterer . compared to the square lattice in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) , the strength of the two modes producing this transparency feature means it should be significantly more robust to experimental limitations and noise .",
    "to better understand the origin of these modes and why they are populated in the kagome lattice and not the square , triangular or hexagonal lattices , we analyze the eigenvectors themselves . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b , c ) we plot the real @xmath86 and @xmath19 vector components of two important kagome eigenmodes ( the imaginary components are much weaker ) . as in [ fig:3](a ) we consider lattice spacing @xmath83 , however the change in these eigenvectors over the parameter range of interest ( @xmath87 ) is negligible .",
    "the behavior of each mode is dependent only on the matrix @xmath44 and contains no information about the driving field polarization or geometry ( except for the detuning @xmath53 which appears in @xmath3 ) .",
    "the choice of driving field simply determines which modes are populated .",
    ", the mode vector patterns for lattices with larger atom numbers are still similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b , c ) ] the strong broader mode [ i : the yellow squares mode in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ] behaves ferroelectrically , with all vectors tending to align with the driving field along @xmath19 ( c.f .  the ferrimagnetic modes in @xcite ) .",
    "a similar mode exists with all vectors aligned along @xmath86 , but this does nt couple with the chosen driving field polarization .",
    "as already mentioned , this is analogous to the symmetric dicke state and appears in all the other lattices we have mentioned as well ( square , triangular , hexagonal ) .    fig .",
    "[ fig:3](c ) shows the mode responsible for the strong interference line - shape [ ii : the pink triangles mode in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) ] . in this mode",
    "we observe alternating rows of ferroelectric dipoles aligned with the driving field along @xmath19 ( lattice site 1 ) , and antiferroelectric dipoles perpendicular to the driving field and anti - aligned with their nearest neighbors ( sites 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the long range nature of the dipole - dipole interaction combined with the non - trivial kagome geometry makes unraveling the origin of this mode behavior a complicated task .",
    "we can however gain insight through considering the individual contributions of different dipoles .",
    "considering first the dipole at lattice site 1 , the dipole vectors of the nearest neighbors at sites 2 and 3 are symmetric in @xmath86 , meaning the sum of the electric fields they radiate onto site 1 has only a @xmath19 component ( the @xmath86 components cancel ) .",
    "the same is true for the remaining dipoles along row 2 - 3 and other rows of that type : for every dipole there is an equal and opposite mirror dipole along the same row canceling all the @xmath86 field components felt at site 1 .",
    "the dipoles along the same row as dipole 1 contribute fields along @xmath19 as does the driving field , resulting in an overall dipole orientation along @xmath19 for dipole 1 .",
    "similar symmetries can be used to explain the behavior of the dipoles at sites 2 and 3 , however what is striking is the stripe - like behavior of these alternating rows .",
    "the kagome lattice can be constructed by removing a triangular lattice with lattice period @xmath88 from a triangular lattice with period @xmath6 @xcite and this double periodicity is manifest in mode ii ( @xmath6 spacing between antiferroelectric dipoles ; @xmath88 spacing between ferroelectric dipoles ) .",
    "this suggests the mode is related to this double periodicity , which does nt exist in the regular lattices .",
    "furthermore , the kagome lattice can be classed as ` semiregular ' , in that its tiling consists of triangular and hexagonal tiles surrounding common vertices , and so even though it shares the same common base unit tiles as the triangular and hexagonal lattices individually , its behavior is still significantly different",
    ". it will be interesting to model the cooperative behavior of other semiregular geometries searching for similar features , as well as investigating the links between our kagome spin lattices and other semiregular lattice phenomena such as photonic flat bands @xcite and geometric frustration @xcite .",
    "note that we have been describing the bulk mode behavior .",
    "the dipole orientations differ at the lattice edges since the contributions from nearby neighbors are different .",
    "however it is the bulk behavior that is characteristic of the modes in this paper and moving to larger lattices simply extends the region over which the bulk behavior manifests without significant changes to the behavior itself .",
    "finally , we consider the effect of experimental imperfections on the observed lineshapes .",
    "so far we have considered perfect systems where every lattice site is occupied by one atom centered exactly on that lattice site ( assuming an infinite trapping potential ) . here",
    "we calculate how some of the effects presented in this paper deteriorate if the lattice filling is not perfect ( not all of the lattice sites are occupied ) and the trapping depth confining the atoms to the lattice is of finite magnitude ( introducing uncertainty in the atomic positions ) . to model the finite trap depth , we assume the trapping potential is a standing wave of amplitude @xmath89 ( considered to be approximately harmonic at the minima ) .",
    "the atomic wavefunctions are assumed to be those of ground state harmonic oscillators , centered on each lattice site .",
    "each realization of the position is therefore determined according to a gaussian probability distribution , @xmath90/\\ell^2 ) } } $ ] , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the lattice recoil energy ( see supplemental materials in @xcite for further details ) .",
    "for relatively high filling factors ( @xmath93 occupation ) and significant trap depths @xmath94 , we see in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](a ) that the narrow subradiant modes responsible for the weak fano resonances are washed out , leaving contributions from the broader , stronger modes only . using the same lattice parameters in the kagome lattice however [ fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) ] , the interference lineshape is still very clear to see .",
    "@xmath93 filling has recently been realized for a @xmath84 array @xcite and trap depths of @xmath95 are possible in , e.g. , optical lattices @xcite where high filling factors are possible via the mott - insulator phase and algorithmic cooling @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that dipoles arranged in a periodic 2d lattice with spacing of order of the driving wavelength respond cooperatively rather than independently .",
    "we observe cooperative decays and shifts akin to those predicted for pairs @xcite and 1d chains @xcite of atomic dipoles , with different superradiant and subradiant cooperative modes being populated .",
    "the interference of these modes produces non - trivial asymmetric line - shapes .",
    "a particularly striking example is shown in the kagome lattice where we observe cooperative eit in a system with only 2 levels",
    ". this 2-level cooperative eit corresponds to interlaced ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases of the coupled spin system .",
    "these 2d lattices provide us with an exciting means to explore interesting many - body spin models as a test - bed for driven dissipative non - equilibrium systems , including in the quantum regime @xcite , and may have direct applications in e.g.  narrow linewidth optical lattice clocks @xcite and subradiant quantum information storage @xcite .",
