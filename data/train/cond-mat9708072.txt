    "an interesting class of materials exhibits , as a distinguishing feature , phase diagrams with several , in some cases with very many , commensurately and incommensurately modulated phases . at present",
    "there exists a large body of experimental data on a multitude of such materials , and various types of models have been proposed as bases for a theoretical description .",
    "an assessment of their merits and their shortcomings depends i ) on the weight which one attaches to the physical justification of the general form of the model and of the special values of its parameters , ii ) on the properties of the real system which are to be explained , and iii ) on the degree of agreement between theory and experiment which one requires .    at the present state of research it seems appropriate to survey a large class of these models on the same footing , to discuss how they are connected with the original atomistic or lattice theoretical basis , to find , if possible , a methodological and hierarchical classification scheme into which they can be fitted , and to compare model predictions of properties like phase diagrams , values of physical quantities etc .  with each other and with experimental data .",
    "there exist extensive discussions of models exhibiting spatially modulated structures@xcite . in the present paper it will be our special concern to discuss how different models are obtained when the basic first principles theory is gradually more and more simplified so that finally theoretical descriptions",
    "arise which allow explicit , though only approximate , calculations of physical properties",
    ". we will be particularly interested in various models whose common feature is that they describe the macroscopic specimens in terms of local variables assigned to discrete crystallographic units on the atomistic level",
    ". we will be especially concerned with a class of such models , which arise if the continuous local variables are projected onto a number of discrete states and , finally , with a description of these states in terms of local pseudo spins with one or several components .    besides the derivation of _ model _ characteristics  e.g.  the global structure of phase diagrams , detailed information on the formation of new phases by structure branchings and their accumulation points ( which are connected with transitions from first to second order phase transitions ) or the exact structure of phase diagrams in the vicinity of multiphase points  we shall also report methods for establishing a connection between theoretical ( model ) data and _ experimentally accessible properties _ of real systems .",
    "an interesting additional aspect of the theoretical treatment is the possibility to incorporate impurities into the theory . on the one hand , this line of the theory is of practical relevance for the understanding of real , imperfect crystals ; on the other hand it is of interest to find out if the basic ideas of the modelling procedure carry so far as to allow also the description of impurity effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a brief reference to the experimental situation and some general remarks on the interrelation of model parameters and measured quantities in section [ section : materials ] , short comments on phenomenological theories of modulated structures and on the derivation of pressure - temperature or temperature - electric field phase diagrams from landau type thermodynamic potentials",
    "are made in section [ section : phenomenology ] . in section [ section :",
    "atomisticmodel ] , a symmetry - based lattice theoretical description of uniaxially modulated structures is presented which provides a framework for reviewing a number of models in the subsequent sections ( models with continuous variables in section [ section : contimodels ] , pseudo spin models in section [ section : psmodels ] ) .",
    "section [ section : application ] describes methods for bridging the gap between the results of model calculations ( in terms of model parameters ) and experimentally observed properties ( in terms of experimental control parameters ) .",
    "these methods do not postulate an ad hoc correspondence but  with further approximations ",
    "make use of the lattice theoretical foundation of the models and of macroscopic material properties .",
    "the incorporation of point defects into the theory is discussed in section [ section : pointdefects ] . in section",
    "[ section : discoutlook ] , a summarizing discussion and an outlook to future developments is given .",
    "during the late 70s and 80s a worldwide hunt@xcite for materials with cascades of structurally modulated phases led to a large amount of experimental data on numerous compounds . the largest class of such crystals is formed by @xmath0-compounds , among which @xmath1 is a prototypical member .",
    "apart from measurements under different temperatures , pressures and electric fields , homologous series of @xmath0-compounds , e.g.  the tetramethylammonium tetrahalogenometallate ( @xmath2 ) series , allow the investigation of the influence of the chemical composition on the sequence of phase transitions .",
    "an outstanding specific material with an especially large number of commensurately or incommensurately modulated phases is betaine calcium chloride dihydrate ( bccd ) .",
    "its phase diagram , which has been thoroughly investigated experimentally e.g.  with respect to its dependence on temperature , pressure , uniaxial stress , electric fields , or impurities shows many very interesting features .",
    "the observed global and local details of the phase diagrams invite a comparison with theoretical predictions to test the performance of various models .",
    "we only briefly mention three further special examples since surveys on structurally modulated materials were given elsewhere ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "these examples are interesting in that they show that in families of isomorpheous compounds materials with properties deviating significantly from the majority behavior may be observed : a ) all investigated modulated substances of the @xmath2 family have their modulation wave vector @xmath3 along @xmath4 with the exception of @xmath5_2cubr_4 $ ] with @xmath6 parallel to @xmath7 ( similar to its homologue@xcite tetramethylphosphonium-@xmath8 ) .",
    "b ) @xmath1 and @xmath9 on the one hand and @xmath10 and @xmath11 on the other hand show cascades of modulated phases but @xmath12 and @xmath13 do not .",
    "c ) whereas most of the members of the @xmath14 family exhibit phase transitions of purely order - disorder type and hence lack a soft mode@xcite , @xmath15 is primarily displacive in its incommensurate transition , but also possesses a significant order - disorder component .",
    "most of the previously mentioned materials with uniaxial structural modulations were investigated at ambient pressure over large temperature intervals ; for some substances , pressure was also varied or the influence of an electric field was studied .",
    "different approaches offer themselves for a theoretical interpretation of these data : a rather rigorous treatment would start from the basic hamiltonian formulated as a function of atomic positions , momenta , and externally imposed parameters ( e.g.  homogenous stresses and electric field components ) .",
    "this hamiltonian might be deduced e.g.  from an ab initio electron theory or from a formulation in terms of empirical interatomic or intermolecular interactions .",
    "this treatment would then employ the methods of statistical mechanics to derive for example thermodynamic potentials for equilibrium structures and phase diagrams .",
    "these would be obtained as functions of temperature and experimental control parameters and could be directly compared with experimental results . if ( due to computational difficulties ) the method is not ( yet ) feasible , one can make use of semiempirical treatments employing suitable models . in the standard procedure for such a model description of modulated systems , physical properties like phase diagrams",
    "are derived from effective model hamiltonians with the help of approximate methods of statistical mechanics .",
    "the results are primarily obtained as functions of temperature and model parameters ( including e.g.  effective intercell interactions and electric field components ) . for a comparison with experimental data",
    "it would be desirable to find physically motivated connections between the effective interactions occuring in the model hamiltonian and experimentally given parameters like temperature and applied stresses .",
    "most applications of model calculations to the interpretations of empirical data restrict themselves , however , to a comparison of general topological features of the model phase diagrams with those obtained experimentally or try to establish an ad hoc correspondence . in ref.@xcite an explicit mapping from a theoretical temperature - interaction - phase diagram to a pressure - temperature phase diagram was presented which makes use of material properties like thermal expansion , elastic constants etc .",
    "the method was used exemplarily for bccd and is described in subsection [ subsection : theoderivedpd ] .",
    "phase diagrams were calculated e.g.  for the diffour model@xcite , the annni model and its extensions@xcite the dis model@xcite , the aanndi model@xcite , and for chen and walker s model@xcite . usually two - dimensional _ planar _ parameter space sections were considered .",
    "all models discussed in the sections [ section : atomisticmodel][section : psmodels ] contain variables that correspond explicitely to microscopic crystalline quantities : both local generalized coordinates or pseudo spins describe degrees of freedom of crystallographic ( sub)cells .",
    "these model variables are coupled by effective interactions , which correspond to certain thermal averages of combinations of original atomistic interactions .",
    "if it were possible to find a temperature- , stress- , and electric field - dependent mapping of the atomistic couplings onto the model parameters , precise predictions for the occurence of phase transitions could be made .",
    "particularly , it would be possible for a special substance to transform a theoretical phase diagram .",
    "because of their experimental relevance , phase diagrams as functions of temperature and pressure are of special interest .",
    "the set of states experimentally accessible by variations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 corresponds to a curved two - dimensional surface in the higher - dimensional model parameter space spanned for example by temperature and effective interactions .",
    "in general , this surface will not be planar .",
    "as the phenomenological landau theory has been the subject of various reviews ( see for example@xcite ) we will focus in the following on different schemes for describing successive transitions between phases characterized by different wave numbers .",
    "we will especially discuss two approaches to handle a cascade of commensurate phases .    in order to describe the cascade of phase transitions of a devil s staircase sannikov@xcite proposed a phenomenological theory in which the sequence of phase transitions is determined by one soft branch of the lattice vibrations .",
    "the thermodynamic potential for a transition to a commensurate phase characterized by the wave number @xmath18 can be written in the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the amplitude and the phase of the normal coordinates .",
    "the coefficients @xmath22 differ from zero only at the points of the brillouin zone given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are integers , i.e.  for every @xmath25 one obtains a different potential @xmath26 ( the wave numbers @xmath27 will be given in units of @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the lattice constants ) .",
    "the limit @xmath30 corresponding to irrational values of @xmath27 yields the potential @xmath31 describing the transition to an incommensurate phase . + the coefficient @xmath32 in eqn .",
    "( [ equation : eq1 ] ) is a continuous function of @xmath27 .",
    "the approximation used for this function depends upon the interval of @xmath27-values considered .",
    "if the end points of the interval do not satisfy the lifshitz condition , @xmath32 is approximated by the expression@xcite @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the wave number of the soft mode responsible for the minimum of the branch @xmath35 .",
    "this first case is realized for example in the @xmath36 family . if , on the contrary , one of the end points satifies the lifshitz condition ( e.g.  @xmath37 ) the proposed form is@xcite @xmath38 which results from an expansion in @xmath39 around the point @xmath37 .",
    "examples for this case are thiourea [ @xmath40 and bccd@xcite . in the following",
    "we will focus on the latter case .    introducing new dimensionless variables @xmath41 and @xmath42 and assuming that the value @xmath43 is the same for all @xmath25 sannikov derived a phase diagram in the @xmath44-@xmath45-space .",
    "@xmath46 has the same dimension as @xmath27 and its value is arbitrary . under the assumption of a linear @xmath16-dependence of @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( and",
    "therefore of @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) the phase sequences were obtained for different materials .    in a detailed analysis for bccd ,",
    "thermodynamic potentials for various values of @xmath27 were derived .",
    "using an ad hoc linear transformation from dimensionless model variables to @xmath16 and @xmath17 and choosing tentative values for the remaining parameters a rather satisfying fit of theoretical to experimental @xmath16-@xmath17 phase diagrams could be obtained@xcite .    in order to study the influence of external ( electric ) fields @xmath49 coupling terms between the fields and the two - component order parameter",
    "were added to the potential ( [ equation : eq1 ] ) .",
    "the transformation properties of the conjugated quantities @xmath50 ( spontaneous polarization ) could than be derived and compared to experiment@xcite .",
    "a different phenomenological theory was developed especially for the interpretation of the phase transition sequence of bccd@xcite .",
    "noticing that the polarization of the ferroelectric low temperature phase ( @xmath37 ) corresponds to the primary order parameter , the starting point for this approach is the free energy density ( in reduced units ) @xmath51 the order parameter is supposed to be site - dependent .",
    "the terms @xmath52 and @xmath53 describe the occurence of modulations whereas the term @xmath54 is responsible for the temperature dependence of the wave vector@xcite .",
    "in addition umklapp terms were introduced into the expression for the free energy density of the commensurate phases and approximated by a forth degree term in the order parameter amplitude , @xmath55 for a commensurate phase with wave number @xmath56 .",
    "+ using the plane - wave approximation ( i.e.  @xmath57 ) and choosing appropriate values for @xmath58 , the phase diagram was derived by computing the free energies of the different phases as functions of temperature@xcite . introducing coupling terms between the order parameter and an electric field@xcite",
    "the @xmath59 phase diagram was calculated . in a subsequent paper@xcite",
    "the sinusoidal scheme was abandoned and the occurence of a multisoliton regime was considered .",
    "models based on the discrete structure of the lattice can provide a way to achieve a physical understanding of the processes on the atomic level of the crystal which goes beyond a mere phenomenological description .",
    "such microscopic models can be handled analytically or numerically . in the subsequent sections models which have been closely studied with respect to the application to",
    "experimentally investigated substances are discussed .",
    "each model variable  either continuous as in the case of the diffour models or discrete as in the case of pseudo spin models  usually describes one degree of freedom per lattice site .",
    "previously it was considered a weak spot , especially of pseudo spin models , that the significance ( on an atomistic scale ) of the model ( pseudo spin ) variables was not well defined .",
    "for this reason we summarize a general procedure for the systematic definition of symmetry - based model variables on a lattice theoretical basis .",
    "this procedure stresses the atomistic roots of the models , leads to models conforming to lattice symmetry and facilitates the prediction of spontaneous polarizations of modulated phases and of the atomic displacements occuring at structural transitions@xcite .",
    "it combines the idea of local modes formulated e.g.  in ref.@xcite with the rigorous symmetry considerations of landau s theory ( for instance , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it leads to a hamiltonian that serves as a starting point for various approximations leading to different models ( e.g. the diffour models or the dis model ) and thus provides a frame for reviewing very different models from a common point of view .",
    "the key idea of the general procedure for the derivation of a microscopic model hamiltonian of this procedure is the introduction of variables as generalized coordinates of symmetry - adapted local modes ( salms ) .",
    "this facilitates the incorporation of both the discreteness of the lattice and the overall symmetry of the crystal .",
    "the symmetry properties of the salms can either be derived from first - principles calculations or taken from experimental data , i.e.  from the observation of the symmetry of the displacements responsible for the phase transitions .",
    "let the crystal be composed of @xmath60 unit cells each containing @xmath61 particles ( of which @xmath62 are non equivalent ) and assume , for definiteness , born - von krmn periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the crystal structure is then described by a @xmath63-dimensional configuration vector @xmath64 , where each entry specifies a component of the position of an atom .",
    "an arbitrary configuration @xmath65 is decomposed into a contribution @xmath66 , which is invariant under all elements @xmath67 of the high temperature normal phase space group @xmath68 , and a symmetry - breaking displacement @xmath69 , which is zero above the transition temperature @xmath70 from the normal phase to the lower symmetry phases ( unmodulated or commensurately or incommensurately modulated ) .",
    "the displacement @xmath69 from a reference structure at given reference values of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , etc .  can be written as a superposition @xmath71 of local contributions @xmath72 .",
    "they describe displacements for only those atoms which are associated to unit @xmath73 , having zero entries for all others .",
    "these units do not necessarily correspond to the unit cells of the crystal ; in the case of the space group @xmath74 discussed in subsection [ subsection : egpnma ] , half cells are chosen as units accounting for the pseudoperiodicity of such crystals along one of the lattice vectors .",
    "@xmath72 is expanded in terms of local modes . in most cases",
    "it is sufficient to retain only a few ( e.g.  one or two ) local modes per unit .    it is useful to choose the local modes such that they reflect the crystal symmetries :",
    "the smallest unit in the crystal with respect to symmetry is the asymmetric unit @xmath75 of the space group @xmath68 .",
    "symmetry imposes no restrictions on the position of the @xmath62 atoms associated to this polyhedral subcell .",
    "further subcells @xmath76 defined by @xmath77 cover the whole crystal .",
    "the @xmath48 space group operations @xmath78 are coset representatives in a coset decomposition of @xmath68 with respect to its invariant subgroup @xmath79 of primitive translations .",
    "the index @xmath80 $ ] equals the order of the point group @xmath81 of @xmath82 and determines the number of subcells @xmath76 per cell @xmath73 .",
    "the coset representatives have to be chosen such that these @xmath48 subcells form a contiguous new choice of cell .",
    "any displacement of the @xmath62 atoms associated with @xmath76 can be expanded in terms of a basis set of @xmath83 subcell modes @xmath84 .",
    "they should satisfy the relation @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the space group operation transforming subcell @xmath87 into @xmath88 .",
    "thus , the modes in any subcell are entirely determined by the ( arbitrary ) choice of modes in the asymmetric unit @xmath75 .",
    "a complete  for @xmath89 over - complete ( see below )  set of @xmath90 local modes can be constructed as linear combinations of the subcell modes @xmath91 with a @xmath92 transformation matrix @xmath93 , the form of which is determined by the irreps of the point group @xmath81 . for fixed @xmath94 each local mode @xmath95 describes the _ same _ displacement pattern of atoms in their respective unit , i.e.  @xmath96 .",
    "we will call the set @xmath97 the @xmath98th set of symmetry - adapted local modes for unit @xmath73 . any linear combination of displacement vectors in one set of salms",
    "has the same symmetry properties .",
    "apart from a primitive translation , an arbitrary space group operation only permutes the subcell indices and thus the transformation behavior of the set of @xmath95 is entirely determined by @xmath93 .",
    "the actual positions of the atoms in the subcells have not to be known .",
    "only those sets of salms can contribute to the structural deformation @xmath99 that have the symmetry properties imposed by the irrep according to which @xmath99 transforms .",
    "the existence of atoms on special positions , i.e.  on faces , edges and corners of the subcells causes the number @xmath90 of local modes to be in general higher than the number @xmath63 of independent displacements .",
    "hence , the coefficients of an expansion of a general displacement in terms of these salms have to satisfy consistency relations .",
    "the symmetry - breaking displacement @xmath72 in unit @xmath73 is decomposed into contributions @xmath100 from the @xmath48 sets of salms : @xmath101 under a continuous change of external parameters the average positions of the atoms are displaced in such a way that a valley of low energy is followed in the high - dimensional configuration space .",
    "the symmetry - breaking displacement of any atom in the asymmetric unit @xmath75 which is connected with the transition is not determined by space group symmetry .",
    "it will , in general , be _ different _ even for materials exhibiting the _ same _ symmetries of the normal and the modulated phases ( e.g.  @xmath14 compounds ) .",
    "hence , the contribution @xmath102 from the @xmath98th set of salms will , in general , lie on a @xmath103-dimensional curved surface or , in its simplest and most frequent case , describe a curved path ( @xmath104 ) upon changing temperature or pressure .",
    "either case corresponds to a simultaneous variation of in general _ all _ coefficients @xmath105 in equation ( [ equation : deltarn ] ) as the fixed subcell modes @xmath106 can not simultaneously be adapted to the curved paths described by every @xmath107 .",
    "thus , instead of using the coefficients from equation ( [ equation : deltarn ] ) as generalized variables for the determination of the displacements in unit @xmath73 , one introduces new local sets of curvilinear coordinates for each set of salms by means of a coordinate transformation @xmath108 such that the contribution @xmath109 to the symmetry - breaking displacement in unit @xmath73 [ cf .  equation ( [ equation : deltarn ] ) ] occurs when @xmath110 increase from zero to some non - zero value whereas all other generalized variables remain at their thermal average of zero . in the simplest case @xmath104 ,",
    "only one relevant variable @xmath111 per set of salms is needed and thus the value of @xmath111 determines a linear combination of displacement vectors from the @xmath98th set of salms for unit @xmath112 ( which has the same transformation behavior as any other linear combination of salms from the same set ) .",
    "on the one hand , the space group symmetries and the direction of the modulation determine the subcell generators @xmath78 and the matrix @xmath93 and thus should be the same for a whole class of materials .",
    "on the other hand , the displacements of atoms in the asymmetric unit and thus the coordinate transformations @xmath113 are determined by the local potential and thus by the specific material under investigation .",
    "this allows a separation of properties specific for a certain class of materials from properties specific for the substance under investigation .",
    "the vector field @xmath114 gives a contribution to the structural transformation in unit @xmath73 with definite transformation behavior .",
    "in general , @xmath115 sets of salms ( @xmath116 without loss of generality ) are needed for the construction of symmetry modes transforming according to irreps of the group @xmath117 of the wave vector .",
    "when @xmath81 has only one - dimensional real irreps and only _ one _ order parameter transforming according to one irrep of @xmath117 gives the primary contribution to the structural deformation ( as it is the case in bccd ) , only one ( @xmath118 ) certain set of salms ( @xmath119 ) and the corresponding symmetry - breaking displacement @xmath120 is needed for every unit .",
    "the reverse is not true because by different spatial modulations of @xmath121 one set of salms can be used to construct symmetry modes transforming according to different irreps of @xmath122 and different sets of salms may contribute to symmetry modes with same transformation behavior ( e.g.  at a point @xmath123 inside the brillouin zone when @xmath122 is a true subgroup of @xmath124 ; examples will be given in subsection [ subsection : egpnma ] ) . especially , the set of salms corresponding to the totally symmetric representation of @xmath81 may be relevant because it may contribute to a structural deformation not transforming according to the totally symmetric representation of @xmath124 .    in the simplest case of one relevant set of salms ( @xmath118 ) and one degree of freedom in the asymmetric unit ( @xmath104 ) , expansion ( [ equation : wexpansion ] )",

    "we will omit the superscript referring to @xmath138 for brevity in the case @xmath104 of one generalized variable for each set of salms .",
    "the models discussed in the subsequent sections can be viewed as special cases of the hamiltonian ( [ equation : hamil1 ] ) or its two - variable versions .",
    "the total number of relevant variables per unit is @xmath139 .",
    "the local potential @xmath140 and the interaction potential @xmath141 are effective potentials which , by their very definition , depend directly on elastic stresses ( which determine the lattice constants ) and on temperature due to the thermal averaging over the irrelevant variables .",
    "the potentials are usually expanded up to forth or second order respectively and only a subset of interactions between nearest , next nearest and third next nearest neighbors is kept .    as in landau theory ,",
    "space group operations can be considered to act on the generalized variables instead on the modes @xmath142 .",
    "hence , symmetry considerations give conditions for the dependence of the potential on the generalized variables , which have for example been taken into account when formulating the aanndi or the dis model .",
    "moreover , the local potential may have equivalent minima : assume that there is one global minimum of the local potential for a certain configurational set of generalized local coordinates ; then every space group operation which transforms a unit into itself but changes the configuration of the respective coordinates may generate another equivalent minimum .",
    "a further simplification may be introduced by projecting the remaining continuous generalized local variables onto two - valued pseudo spin variables as the signs of the former .",
    "this leads to different pseudo spin models : we discussed either the annni model in the case of one relevant mode per half cell or the dis model in the case of two relevant variables earlier@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ equation : hamil1 ] ) corresponds to a version of the diffour model with one degree of freedom per lattice site or to the annni model .",
    "the more general case where two local modes with different transformation behavior ( @xmath143 ) are incorporated corresponds to chen and walker s model or to the dis model .",

    "\\4 ) finally there is the problem of translating the results of model calculations obtained as functions of the model parameters into data which can be quantitatively compared to experimental data , i.e.  which are expressed as functions of experimentally given quantities like pressure or stresses ( besides temperature ) . in section [ section : application ] it was shown how this can be done . by making use of macroscopic material constants , a",
    "physically motivated mapping from one parameter set to the other can be performed . for the material considered ( bccd )",
    "the results show a satisfactory agreement with experimental data",
    ".    in the last years considerable effort has been addressed to the approaches described in section [ section : psmodels ] , that is to the formulation of various @xmath17-state and pseudo spin models and to their statistical mechanics .",
    "methods applied were mfa calculations , exact series expansions for selected regions in parameter space , and monte carlo simulations .",
    "combining these approaches , a reliable theoretical determination of most of the interesting thermodynamic properties of such models is possible .",
    "a transformation of these model properties into a form directly comparable to experimental data can be performed by the procedure described in subsection [ subsection : theoderivedpd ] or by a similar scheme .",
    "an interesting by - product of this method is information on the dependence of the model parameters on the experimentally given state variables and especially on the lattice distortions .",
    "combined with a consideration of experimentally determined atomic positions in some of the more stable phases , this should further the understanding of the local dynamics responsible for the transition sequences .    of special interest , finally , would be the determination of model parameters  for not too complicated materials  from an atomistic theory .",
    "it should be possible , with the nowadays available computing power , to carry through the necessary calculations .",
    "investigations of this type would clarify the details of the relevant atomistic mechanisms and e.g.  help to understand why the phase diagrams of members of the same homologous family of materials may differ drastically .",
