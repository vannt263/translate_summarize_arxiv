    "black hole ( bh ) thermodynamics is an example of non - perturbative , semi - classical , quantum gravity effect based on the key results by bekenstein and hawking .",
    "this approach contained an implicit and not fully appreciated idea of fluid / gravity duality , @xcite which is one of the main outcome of the recent development in @xmath0 duality @xcite .",
    "the assignement of an entropy and a temperature to bhs assumes the existence of a ( large ) number of microscopic `` constituents '' ( entropy ) with an average kinetic energy ( temperature ) .",
    "the true nature of these constituents is still not well understood though a macroscopic description is available in terms of a generalized thermodynamics . in this description",
    "the mass plays the role of internal energy , the area of the event horizon is identified with the entropy , while the coulomb potential on the bh surface and the angular velocity are treated as a sort of chemical potentials .",
    "+ one of the most important outcome of this approach is the discovery of phase transitions for bhs in ads background @xcite .",
    "this result was extended to charged bhs in @xcite , where an analogy with the van der waals ( vdw ) description of a liquid - gas phase transition was described .",
    "while intriguing , this analogy relies mainly on a shape similarity between the graph of the inverse hawking temperature and the vdw isotherm in the p - v plane , thus forcing the identification of @xmath1 with @xmath2 and the bh radius @xmath3 with the volume .",
    "however , a proper definition of the canonical variables @xmath4 was missing in the original formulation of the bh thermodynamics .",
    "+ only recently , the cosmological constant has been promoted to the role of pressure and included in an extended version of the bh first law @xcite .",
    "this extended approach allows to investigate ads bh phase transitions in the p - v plane and give the vdw picture a non - ambiguous formulation @xcite . + a brief comment on the problems encountered in the original formulation bh thermodynamics can help to understand the goal of this paper .",
    "+ the whole picture of bh radiation is formulated as a semi - classical approximation where matter is quantized , but gravity is represented by a classical background geometry . on the other hand ,",
    "the late stage of evaporation involves planck scale physics implying that the semi - classical approximation becomes unreliable in this regime",
    ". the problem can be by - passed for charged and rotating bhs where conserved charge , or angular momentum , stop the evaporation process when an extremal configuration is reached . even by assuming the most favorable situation ,",
    "when charge and angular momentum are neither totally radiated away during the collapse `` balding - phase '' , nor by quantum mechanical instability after the bh forms , another problem remains standing .",
    "a charged ads bh geometry is characterized by two length scales : the ads curvature radius @xmath5 , and the charge @xmath6 ( in geometric units ) . below a critical value of the ratio @xmath7 , the graph of the temperature as a function of the horizon radius develops an ``  oscillating  '' part corresponding to a negative specific heat . at the end - points of the oscillation interval (  which are a maximum and a minimum of the temperature  ) the specific heat diverges .",
    "a negative specific heat implies the absence of thermodynamical equilibrium between the bh and the surrounding heat bath , while divergences signal the onset of a phase transition where the physics of the system undergoes an abrupt change .",
    "+ in the absence of a proper understanding of the bh microscopic structure , no plausible physical picture of this behavior have been given so far .",
    "+ on the other hand , it is known that the vdw theory is a _ phenomenological _ description of a ``  real  '' gas which breaks down below the critical temperature . in this regime ,",
    "isotherms in the @xmath2-@xmath8 plane start to develop pair of extremal points . between",
    "the minimum and the maximum an increase of volume corresponds to an unexpected increase of pressure which is in sharp contradiction with the experimental results indicating the presence of an _",
    "isobaric plateau_. the theoretical prediction and experimental data are reconciled by replacing the oscillating part of the isotherms by an horizontal isobar satisfying maxwell s equal area construction . + the hawking temperature for an ads charged bh shows a similar oscillatory behavior with the negative specific heat and thermally unstable , region .",
    "+ then , one can implement the same maxwell construction for the oscillating part of the bh temperature in ( t , s ) plane .",
    "+ in this paper we present the construction of the isotherm area - law in the hawking temperature as a function of the entropy .",
    "this provides a picture of the ads bh critical behavior with a novel motivation for the stability of extremal bh .",
    "our theoretical laboratory where to investigate the vdw fluid / bh duality is provided by the reissner - nordstrm anti - desitter ( rnads ) metric .",
    "the choice of the metric is suggested by its central role in @xmath9 duality in which the charged bh is dual to a strongly coupled gluon plasma @xcite . on the other hand , this model is simple enough for the reader to be able to follow the reasoning presented in the paper .",
    "the line element of the rnads metric is given as @xmath10 where , @xmath11 is the mass , @xmath6 is the electric charge in geometric units , and the ads curvature radius @xmath5 is related to the cosmological constant as @xmath12 .",
    "we briefly review the properties of the solution ( [ uno ] ) which are relevant for our discussion .",
    "+ metric ( [ uno ] ) describes a non - degenerate black hole for a mass @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mass of an extremal configuration of radius @xmath15 :    @xmath16    the corresponding hawking temperature @xmath17 is given by ( see figure([th ] ) @xmath18    , for different values of @xmath19 .",

    "it is _ negative _ for @xmath32 .",
    "the negative sign means that the bh can not establish a thermal equilibrium with the environment .",
    "+ our poor understanding of the bh microscopic structure does not permit to grasp true physical nature of these changes of state .",
    "+ these extrema merge into an _ inflexion _",
    "point for @xmath33 , corresponding to the critical values given by @xmath34 and @xmath35    on the other hand , when @xmath36 , @xmath17 is _ monotonically increasing _ and there is a single , thermally stable black hole .",
    "+ the temperature graph analysis includes only the temperature and the geometric volume @xmath37 as thermodynamical variables , while the cosmological constant @xmath38 is simply a free parameter such as @xmath6 .",
    "+ an early attempt to introduced the * pressure * was carried out in @xcite .",
    "it was pointed that , plotting @xmath1 versus @xmath27 , the resulting graph looks alike the vdw isotherm * provided * one identifies @xmath1 with @xmath2 , @xmath27 with the volume @xmath8 , and assigns @xmath6 the role of `` temperature '' . while interesting , this approach is not uniquely defined and mismatches intensive and extensive thermodynamical variables @xcite .",
    "+ recently , an alternative vdw description of bh phase transitions has been presented in @xcite where the cosmological constant is assigned the role of the pressure for a `` real gas '' @xcite , while the specific volume is identified with @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the planck length .",
    "the temperature of the gas is the hawking temperature .",
    "this interpretation is much more physically sound and avoids the above mentioned confusion among intensive and extensive variables .",
    "the key point is to introduce in the equation ( [ ht ] ) two thermodynamical variables @xmath41 while the cosmological constant is the most likely candidate for the pressure , as the ``  vacuum pressure  '' , to a classical picture , where @xmath38 is the pressure of a ``  real gas  ' ' . ] , it is less intuitive to identify the specific volume with the radius of the horizon . + once the equation ( [ ht ] ) is written in the form @xmath42 , its graph looks like the vdw curve for a `` real gas '' at the temperature @xmath17 :    @xmath43    now , the same equation can be seen either as the hawking temperature for a bh of radius @xmath27 in a given , charged , ads background ( [ ht ] ) , or as the pressure of a van der waals fluid ( [ vdw ] ) enclosed in a ( specific)volume @xmath44 and heated at the temperature @xmath45 .",

    "is the analogue of exchanging kaluza - klein and winding modes in string theory .",

    "_ to each other in the sense that they are described by the _",

    "the mapping between the two systems is given by equations ( [ press]),([vspec])_. + for further discussion it is useful to recall that the vdw theory is a ``  phenomenological  '' description of a real gases . below the critical temperature",
    "the vdw formula predicts an ``  oscillatory  '' region characterized by a pair of extremal points .",
    "this behavior is in contradiction with the experimental evidence of an ``  isobaric plateau  '' , where the pressure remains constant while the specific volume changes . + in order to reconcile theory and experiment maxwell introduced the ``  equal area law  '' .",
    "this is a prescription aimed to replace the oscillatory region with an isobar , @xmath48 , cutting the pressure graph in such a way that the area below and above the isobar are the same : @xmath49 where @xmath48 denotes the _ equal area isobar_. + the physical interpretation of the constant pressure part of the curve is that it describes the coexisting , mixed phase of fluid and gas .",

    "+ paralleling the gas behavior to the bh thermal instability along the oscillatory part of the hawking temperature graph , invokes the same ``  _ flattening _  '' procedure in the equation ( [ ht ] ) .",
    "+ the key idea of this paper is to complete the physical analogy between the adsrn bh and the vdw fluid by implementing the _ maxwell construction in the gravitational sector _ and exchanging the isobar equal - area , in the gas picture , with an isotherm in the bh picture .",

    "the temperature graph of the physical bh phase transition is given by the figure([true ] ) .",
    "+ thus , in our picture the temperature graph of the physical bh phase transition should be as in figure([true ] )        the maxwell construction modifies significantly the phase structure as described in the first part of the paper . in the gravitational sector",
    "we have following phases :    * for @xmath87 we find a single bh in a ``  liquid - phase  '' ; * for @xmath88 we find a single bh in a ``  gas - phase  '' ; * for @xmath89 we find bhs in a ``  coexisting gas - liquid - phases  '' transiting from one phase to another    the isotherm part of the graph , replacing the oscillatory region , represents the phase transition during which the black hole is in the mixed state and undergoes gradual transition from the gaseous to liquid state .",
    "this transition is characterized by a hawking emission during which the radius of the horizon is decreasing while temperature remains constant , contrary to the usual situation .",
    "this presumably indicates some kind of microscopical constituents \" condensation  which remains to be better understood .",
    "once the radius @xmath90 is reached the black hole is in a ``  liquid - phase  '' .",
    "+ one could be tempted to say that during the change of state , the cosmological constant ( pressure ) of the background geometry is varying .",
    "this , however , is not the case .",
    "the reason is that the maxwell construction for the real gas with varying p replaces the oscillating part of the _ constant _ temperature curve with a * constant * pressure segment .",
    "it is only in this side of the duality that the question : `` does the pressure vary during the phase transition ? '' can be answered .",
    "the analog of this isobaric plateau , in the gravitational case , is a _ constant _ temperature interval at _ constant _ pressure . during the coexisting phases regime",
    "the bh evolution significantly departs from the hawking behavior : the emission of thermal radiation does not diminish the temperature and does not affect the cosmological constant .",
    "it is the bh `` internal structure '' which is suffering some sort of re - arrangement , not the background ads geometry .",
    "+ finally , the bh reaches its extremal configuration which is dual to the minimal ``  molecular  '' volume for the vdw fluid .",
    "this analogy provides an intuitive explanation for the stability , i.e. in - compressibility , of the extremal bh .",
    "it may seem that this type of stable ground state is limited to charged bhs , but this is not the case as we discuss in the conclusions .",
    "in this paper we have extended the idea of fluid / gravity analog in order to provide a new picture of the isothermal behavior of critical charged bh in ads background .",
    "we construct the maxwell area law in the hawking temperature description of bh .",
    "the outcome of this procedure is that physical bh undergoes an _",
    "transition from gas to liquid phase at constant pressure .",
    "consequently there are neither regions with negative nor divergent specific heat .",
    "furthermore , we were able to find analytic solutions the area law both in @xmath91 and @xmath92 planes . we conclude that working in the @xmath91 plane gives non - trivial advantage with respect to the wdv description in ( p , v ) plane .",
    "+ last but not the least , duality identifies the minimal molecular volume with extremal bh configuration providing a physical argument for its incompressibility .",
    "+ it may seem that the described mechanism is limited to rnads , because of the key role played by the electric charge in providing extremal configuration .",
    "we claim that the same behavior will occur in any geometry endowed with a short - distance length scale , independently of its origin .",
    "we really have in mind a larger picture involving regular bhs that have been investigated in a recent set of papers @xcite . in these geometries a minimal length is embedded into the space - time fabric at the fundamental level .",
    "what is crucial for duality to work is the existence of an extremal configuration , notoriously known to exist for charged and/or rotating bhs in standard geometries , but also present in the case of regular neutral , non - rotating bhs . in a picture",
    "where extremal bhs are viewed as un - shrinkable molecules of gas , it is natural to look for a relation between the size of these molecules and the minimal length from the vantage point of the self - complete quantum gravity approach recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "the phase portrait for such bhs will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "this note is limited to the rnads black hole for we believe that readers are more familiar with this geometry and can grasp better our approach idea and its consequences .",
