    "in the past twenty years , the usage of the internet has transitioned from being primarily academic / research - oriented to one that is primarily commercial in nature . in the current internet environment , each commercial entity is inherently interested only in its own profit .",
    "developing network mechanisms that are designed to handle selfish behavior has therefore gained increasing attention in recent years .",
    "the game theoretic approach , which was originally designed to model and guide decisions in economic markets , provides a valuable set of tools for dealing with selfish behavior @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we consider the network congestion problem at a single intermediate store - and - forwarding spot in the network .",
    "several users send their packets to a single server with poisson arrival rate .",
    "the server processes the packets on a first come first serve ( fcfs ) basis with an exponentially distributed service time .",
    "this is an m / m/1 queueing model  @xcite .",
    "there exists a trade - off in this m / m/1 queueing model between throughput ( representing the benefit from service ) , and delay ( representing the waiting cost in the queue ) . in the gateway congestion control context @xcite , a measure that is widely used to describe this trade - off",
    "is called  power \" , which is defined as the weighted ratio of the throughput to the delay .",
    "when the users are selfish , we can formulate a basic m / m/1 queueing game . in this game , we assume that the users are selfish , and each control their own input arrival rate to the server . each user s utility is modeled to be the power ratio for that user s packets .",
    "this classic m / m/1 queueing game has been formulated and studied in @xcite .",
    "the results from these prior works and our own results in this work are in agreement that the basic m / m/1 queuing game has an inefficient nash equilibrium .",
    "we are therefore motivated to design an incentive mechanism to force the users to operate at an equilibrium that is globally efficient .",
    "in particular , we focus on the design of a packet dropping scheme implemented at the server for this purpose .",
    "our objective is that the dropping scheme should be as simple as possible , and it should minimize the price of anarchy ( poa , the ratio of the social optimum welfare to the welfare of the worst nash equilibrium ) to be as close to 1 as possible .",
    "a key contribution of this work is the formulation of a modified m / m/1 queuing game with a randomized packet dropping policy at the server .",
    "we consider a simple and low overhead policy in our formulation , wherein the server need only monitor the sum of the rates of all users in the system . we show that this modified game with a packet dropping scheme is an _ ordinal potential game _",
    "@xcite , which implies the existence of at least one pure nash equilibrium .",
    "we show first that utilizing a step - function for packet dropping whereby the server drops all the packets when the sum - rate is greater than a threshold ( and none when the sum - rate is below the threshold ) , results in infinite number of undesired nash equilibria which harms the poa .",
    "this raises the question whether a more sophisticated approach can do better .",
    "we show that indeed this is possible .",
    "in particular , we develop an incentive mechanism with a linear packet dropping that can improve the system efficiency to be arbitrarily close to the global optimal point ( i.e. , a poa arbitrarily close to 1 ) .",
    "this mechanism is similar to the random early detection ( red ) used for congestion avoidance on the internet  @xcite .",
    "we prove the uniqueness of ne of the game with this mechanism .",
    "we also show that best response dynamics will converge to the unique ne .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : related ] summarizes the related work .",
    "we present the model of an m / m/1 queue game in section [ sec : prob ] .",
    "the social welfare and price of anarchy are described in section [ sec : anarchy ] to investigate the efficiency of the ne .",
    "then , in section [ sec : scheme ] , we propose to design an incentive packet dropping scheme implemented at the server to improve the efficiency .",
    "section [ sec : potential ] proves that the game defined with packet dropping policy is an ordinal potential game by giving the potential function .",
    "section [ sec : best ] shows the best response function . in section [ sec : step ] , we show the behavior when utilizing a simple step - function for packet dropping . in section [ sec : linear ] we propose the red - like linear packet dropping incentive scheme .",
    "we show that with this scheme , it is possible to make the price of anarchy arbitrarily close to the optimal point .",
    "the uniqueness of ne of such a game is proved in section [ sec : uniqueness ] . in section [ sec : convergence ] , we show that the best response dynamics will converge to the unique nash equilibrium . in section [ sec :",
    "estimation ] , we undertake simulations to see how the process of statistically estimating the input arrival rates in a real system would impact the poa .",
    "we conclude the work in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "throughput - delay tradeoffs in m / m/1 queues with selfish users have been previously studied in @xcite . a utility function for each user",
    "is defined as the corresponding application s power and each user is treated as a player in such a game and adjusts its arrival rate to handle the trade - off between throughput and delay .",
    "every user is assumed to be selfish and only wants to maximize its own utility function in a distributed manner .",
    "bharath - kumar and jaffe @xcite wrote one of the earliest papers on the formulation of throughput - delay tradeoffs in m / m/1 queues with selfish users .",
    "the paper discusses the properties of power as a network performance objective function .",
    "a class of greedy algorithms where each user updates its sending rate synchronously to the best response of all other users rates to maximize the power is proposed .",
    "convergence of the best response to an equilibrium point is shown in this paper .",
    "douligeris and mazumdar @xcite extended bharath - kumar and jaffe s work to the case with different weighting factors defined in the power function for different users and provided analytical results describing the nash equilibrium .",
    "they showed that the equilibrium point that the greedy best response dynamic algorithm converged to was a unique nash equilibrium .",
    "the work by zhang and douligeris @xcite proved the convergence of the best response dynamics for this basic m / m/1 queueing game under the multiple users case .",
    "thus all these prior works ( @xcite ) studied only variants of the basic game .",
    "their work , along with ours , shows that this basic game results in an inefficient outcome .",
    "our work is the first to develop a mechanism design for this problem that addresses this shortcoming by showing how to achieve near - optimal performance using a packet - dropping policy .",
    "dutta _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied a related problem involving a server that employs an oblivious active queue management scheme , i.e. drops packets depending on the total queue occupancy with the same probability regardless of which flow they come from .",
    "they also consider an m / m/1 setting with users offering poisson traffic to a server with exponential service time .",
    "the users actions are the input rates and the utilities the goodput / output rates .",
    "the existence and the quality of symmetric nash equilibria are studied for different packet dropping policies .",
    "although our work also explores oblivious packet dropping schemes , it is different from and somewhat more challenging to analyze than @xcite , because our utility function reflects the tradeoff between goodput and delay .    in another , more recent work , @xcite , su and van der schaar have discussed linearly coupled communication games in which users utilities are linearly impacted by their competitors actions .",
    "an m / m/1 fcfs queuing game with the power as the utility function is one illustrative example of linearly coupled communication games .",
    "they also quantify the price of anarchy in this case , and investigate an alternative solution concept called conjectural equilibrium , which requires users to maintain and operate upon additional beliefs about competitors .",
    "there have been also several other papers related to queueing games , albeit with different formulations .",
    "haviv and roughgarden  @xcite considered a system with multiple servers with heterogeneous service rates .",
    "arrivals from customers are routed to one of the servers , and the routing decisions are analyzed based on ne or social optimization schemes .",
    "poa is shown to be upper bounded by the number of servers for the social optimum .",
    "wu and starobinski @xcite analyzed the poa of @xmath0 parallel links where the delays of links are characterized using unbounded delay functions such as m / m/1 or m / g/1 queueing functions .",
    "economides and silvester @xcite studied a multiserver two - class queueing game and developed the routing policy .    for more general surveys on game theoretic formulations of networking problems , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "we consider a m / m/1 fcfs queue game as shown in fig . [ fig:1 ] .",
    "there are @xmath1 users with independent poisson arrivals and the arrival rates are @xmath2 .",
    "there is a single server and the service time is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath3 .",
    "we consider each user as a player for this game and the users are selfish .",
    "each player wants to maximize its own utility function by adjusting its rate sending to the queue .",
    "note that there is a tradeoff between the throughput and delay for each user , i.e. , given the rates of all other users , if the input rate increases , the delay increases too . in this paper",
    ", we consider the measurement of this tradeoff between the throughput and delay of the each user , and it is known as the `` power '' , which is widely used in the gateway congestion control context @xcite .",
    "we consider the power as the utility function of each user to measure its throughput - delay tradeoff . for a given user @xmath4 , the power is defined as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a parameter chosen based on the relative emphasis placed on throughput versus delay .",
    "@xmath7 when throughput is more important , while @xmath8 when we want to emphasis delay more , and @xmath9 when the throughput and delay are emphasized equally .    for m",
    "/ m/1 queue , the throughput for user @xmath4 is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the effective rate served by the server .",
    "the delay for user @xmath4 is calculated as : @xmath12 .",
    "so the power for user @xmath4 can be expressed as : @xmath13    in this m / m/1 game , each player is selfish and wants to adjust its arrival rate @xmath14 to maximize its own utility function . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume that the queue is stable and thus @xmath15 .    when there is no dropping policy implemented at the server , @xmath16 , and the optimization problem for each player @xmath4 is : @xmath17",
    "in @xcite the above m / m/1 queue game is studied and a unique pure ne is proved to be : @xmath18    when @xmath19 , this unique ne is expressed as @xmath20 .",
    "now suppose all users cooperate to achieve the maximal system utility .",
    "we consider two ways to define the social optimal function : the sum of the utilities of all the users and the sum of the logarithm of the utilities of all the users .",
    "defining the social optimal function as the sum of the utilities of all the users is a common way for evaluating the system efficiency and we present the analysis results under this definition first .",
    "however , the fairness among the users should also be considered and it is not revealed under this definition ; so we also consider a log - sum - utility social welfare function which provides for utility fairness .",
    "we can measure the efficiency of the system using two well known measures called the price of anarchy ( poa ) and price of stability ( pos ) , that respectively compare the performance of selfish users in the worst and best case nash equilibrium with the global optimum achievable with non - selfish users .",
    "the definition of poa and pos of a game @xmath21 is : @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the set of all the nash equilibriums in game @xmath21 .",
    "the optimization problem is defined as : @xmath25    here we consider two cases :    \\1 ) @xmath26    first calculate @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28    we can get @xmath29 .",
    "equality holds in equation [ eqn : uopt1 ] when @xmath30 for some @xmath4 , and @xmath31 .",
    "hence this is also the solution for @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33    then we calculate @xmath34 when players are selfish : @xmath35    note that there is only one ne in the game , so poa and pos are the same and they are derived as below : @xmath36    in this case we find that the poa and pos are proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "\\2 ) @xmath38    the calculation is similar as above , and details are omitted .",
    "we also get @xmath29 , @xmath40    poa and pos are : @xmath41    in this case we find that the poa and pos are proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "thus in both cases , we find that the poa and pos degrade linearly or worse with the number of users .",
    "now let s consider the sum of the logarithm of the utilities of all the users .",
    "the reason we consider the logarithm function in the social welfare is because when all users cooperate to achieve the optimum , fairness among the users should also be considered , and a logarithmic function would ensure this .",
    "the social welfare optimization problem is : @xmath42 \\label{equ:2}\\\\   s.t . & & 0 \\leq \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^m \\lambda_i < \\mu \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\lambda_i \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall i = 1 , 2 , \\ldots , m   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that for each player , maximizing the logarithm of its utility function is equivalent to maximizing the utility function itself",
    ". therefore the ne remains the same as before .",
    "denote @xmath43 .",
    "we have the following theorem for finding out the social optimum :    [ claim:1 ] the solution for the social welfare optimization problem is : @xmath44 .    see appendix [ appendix : proof01 ] .",
    "note that @xmath45 is shown in ( [ equ:7 ] ) and by substituting it into ( [ equ:4 ] ) , we get the power for user @xmath4 as : @xmath46    in general , the log - utility terms can be negative . to ensure that both the numerator and denominator terms in the poa and pos are non - negative in this case , we use a monotonic exponential mapping . note that there is only one ne in the game , so poa and pos are the same , and",
    "they are derived as below :",
    "@xmath47    from ( [ equ:8 ] ) we can see that poa increases monotonically as @xmath1 increases and goes to infinity as @xmath1 goes to infinity .",
    "so we want to implement an incentive mechanism to improve the poa .",
    "note that @xmath48 . this inspires us to find an incentive packet dropping mechanism implemented at the server and we wish this packet dropping mechanism to be as simple as possible .",
    "so we consider the case where the server need only monitor the sum of the rates of all users in the system and implement the packet dropping policy based only on this information .",
    "then the packet dropping function could be expressed as @xmath49 .",
    "so the optimization problem for each user @xmath4 with a dropping policy in the system is : @xmath50    to facilitate the derivation , denote @xmath51 and thus @xmath52 is the probability of keeping packets in the system .",
    "then the optimization problem for each player @xmath4 is : @xmath53    we denote the above game as @xmath54 .",
    "in this section , we prove that when the dropping function is a function which only depends on the sum of total incoming rates , the game is a potential game and thus there exists at least one pure ne .",
    "a game @xmath55 is called an _ ordinal potential game _ if there exists a global function @xmath56 such that for every player @xmath57 , for every @xmath58 and for every @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the sign function that takes on the value -1 when @xmath62 , 0 when @xmath63 , and 1 when @xmath64 . also , the following theorem [ theorem:1 ] holds for the existence of ne in a potential game :    [ theorem:1 ] [ monderer - shapley , 1996  @xcite ] every potential game with finite - players , continuous utilities , and compact strategy sets possesses at least one pure - strategy equilibrium .",

    "however its strategy sets are not compact in ( [ equ:31 ] ) so we could not directly apply theorem [ theorem:1 ] to claim there exists at least one ne in @xmath65 .",

    "the length of each vector is scaled to @xmath228 of the original length .",
    "the figure shows that at each point , the players in the best response dynamic move towards the equilibrium point .",
    "the length of the best response vectors are proportional to the distance from the equilibrium point . at the equilibrium point",
    ", the step size of the movement in the next iteration tends to zero , which implies the convergence of the best response dynamic .",
    "for a real system implementation , the server needs to estimate the total arrival rate from users in order to apply the incentive packet dropping scheme .",
    "the packets arrive randomly over time , so there will be a difference between the estimated total rate and the average total rate . this inaccuracy will cause a loss in the poa . while applying the packets dropping scheme , we note that the closer to 1 the desired poa is , the steeper ( on the linear part ) the packet dropping scheme is , and therefore , the greater the impact of estimation inaccuracy will be .",
    "so as the desired poa approaches 1 , on the one hand the poa of the real system should increase due to the implementation of the incentive scheme , but on the other hand , the sensitivity to estimation error will reduce the gain in poa .",
    "therefore , the achieved poa in practice may not be arbitrarily close to 1 .",
    "we show this fact in figure  [ fig:8 ] to  [ fig:11 ] where we show simulation results from a 3-user queue with @xmath232 . in these simulations , we discretize time into slots .",
    "the server estimates the mean arrival rate from the previous time slot and applies the packet dropping function corresponding to a desired poa to all packets in the current slot ( the users contribute arrivals at a constant rate that corresponds to the equilibrium input for this desired poa ) .",
    "the running time for all the simulations is @xmath233 time slots .",
    "figure  [ fig:8 ] and [ fig:9 ] show the simulation results of poa under different service rates for both the sum - utility definition and sum - log - utility definition with the instantaneous arrival rate to the server as the estimated arrival rate .",
    "we can see that as the service rate varies from 500 to 5000 packets per time slot , the optimal point of poa ( i.e. the lowest achievable poa ) is getting closer to 1 because the estimation inaccuracy decreases . also , the empirically achieved poa is getting closer to the desired poa .",
    "note that when the service rate is low , the achievable poa we get could be very bad as shown in figure  [ fig : a1 ] and [ fig : b1 ] . in these cases , using more history data / longer estimation lengths will help to increase the estimation accuracy and improve poa .",
    "the comparison results under different estimation lengths for @xmath234 packets per time slot are shown in figure  [ fig:10 ] and [ fig:11 ] .",
    "these simulation results illustrate a tradeoff between the optimal poa and the overhead in computing and storage : while estimating with more history data will increase the estimation accuracy and therefore increase poa , it increases the overhead in terms of computing and storage .",
    "in this paper , we have designed a novel incentive mechanism for m / m/1 queueing games with throughput - delay tradeoffs . because the original game yields an inefficient nash equilibrium ,",
    "we propose to implement a linear packet dropping mechanism at the router .",
    "we show how the parameters of this mechanism can be optimized to ensure system efficiency that is arbitrarily close to the social welfare solution .",
    "further , we prove that the proposed modification has a unique ne , and that the simple best response dynamics converges to this solution .",
