    "one example of rapidly - evolving sne in this luminosity range is so - called `` ca - rich gap transients . ''",

    "they showed that tight helium star  neutron star ( ns ) binary systems , presumably created in the common - envelope phase from high - mass x - ray binaries @xcite , can lead to the extreme stripping of the helium envelope and result in sne with ejecta masses of the order of 0.1  @xmath15  or less .",
    "the sn ejecta mass from these systems is even less than those typically obtained in sn progenitors from the first exploding stars ( @xmath16 ) during binary evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several studies have investigated the observational properties of stripped - envelope sne with ejecta larger than 1  @xmath15  coming from progenitors obtained from binary stellar evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , few lc and spectral studies have been carried out for ultra - stripped sne .",
    "a previous study of ultra - stripped sne @xcite only provided lc models . because there are several proposed ways to make sne with rapidly - evolving lcs , lc information is not sufficient to identify ultra - stripped sne observationally .",

    "ultra - stripped sne are closely connected to the formation of double ns systems .",
    "it was argued by @xcite that _ all _ double ns systems formed in the galactic disk ( i.e. , outside dense environments such as globular clusters ) which are tight enough to merge within a hubble time _ must _ have been produced from an ultra - stripped sn . therefore , ultra - stripped sne are related to sources of gravitational waves detected by ligo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , double ns systems which merge are suggested to cause short gamma - ray bursts @xcite and @xmath17-process element nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , possibly followed by a so - called `` kilonova '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , to produce a double ns system a massive binary must survive two sn explosions .",
    "a binary system is likely to be disrupted by the first sn explosion because of a combination of sudden mass loss and a kick imparted to the newborn ns @xcite .",
    "ultra - stripped sne , on the other hand , eject very little mass and are unlikely to have large ns kicks in general because of their rapid explosions @xcite .",
    "thus , ultra - stripped sne avoid these two major obstacles in forming double ns systems and are therefore likely to produce systems which lead to merger events if the post - sn orbital period is short enough .",
    "future constraints on the observed rate of ultra - stripped sne can be directly compared to the double ns merger rate determined from gravitational wave observations @xcite .",
    "this can be used to verify their evolutionary connection .",

    "we investigate the observational properties of explosions originating from the ultra - stripped sn progenitor presented in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "we used the same physical parameters as in the @xcite ` bec ` calculations in ` mesa ` .",

    ", weak reactions play an important role in the evolution of the core approaching collapse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "first , we evolved a star starting from the helium zams as is done by @xcite , but as a single star .",
    "because the mass lost by the binary interactions like roche - lobe overflow is known from the binary calculation of @xcite , we imposed their mass loss in our single - star evolution calculation .",
    "thus , our single - star evolution calculation takes mass loss caused by binary stellar evolution into account in a simplified way .",
    "@xcite obtained a 1.50  @xmath15  helium star with a carbon+oxygen core of 1.45  @xmath15  from a helium zams star of 2.90  @xmath15  which suffers from roche - lobe overflow to a ns with initial orbital period of 0.1  days .",
    "we slightly increased the initial helium mass to 2.949  @xmath15  in order to obtain the same carbon+oxygen core mass after the core helium burning in our ` mesa ` calculation .",

    "the star forms an fe core and collapses as was presumed by @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that low - mass core - collapse sn progenitors experience violent silicon flashes shortly before the core collapse @xcite , but we do not find such a flash in our model .",
    "if such a flash occurs , it may result in a creation of a dense helium - rich circumstellar medium around the progenitor and the sn may be observed as type ibn ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the final density structure of the progenitor at collapse is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : progenitordensity ] .",
    "the abundance of the fe - group elements sharply increases at an enclosed mass of 1.35  @xmath15 , while the electron fraction sharply decreases there .",
    "thus , we estimate that the final iron - core mass at the time of collapse is 1.35  @xmath15 .",
    "this iron - core mass is comparable to that obtained recently by @xcite ( 1.33  @xmath15 ) from a progenitor model with a similar carbon+oxygen core mass as ours ( 1.45  @xmath15 ) .",

    "the collapsing progenitor described in the previous section was then used to follow the explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "numerical calculations of explosive nucleosynthesis were performed with the same numerical code as in previous studies of explosive nucleosynthesis in core - collapse sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we have investigated the observational properties of an ultra - stripped sn explosion from a progenitor with a mass of 1.50  @xmath15 . depending on the initial binary parameters and the helium zams mass of the progenitor , the final total mass and core mass vary considerably @xcite .",
    "however , recent numerical simulations of explosions of ultra - stripped core - collapse sne find that the explosion energy and the synthesized @xmath2  mass do not change significantly among progenitors of different core masses @xcite .",
    "thus , the explosion energy and @xmath2  mass values investigated in this paper are likely to remain similar even in different ultra - stripped sn progenitors .",
    "the low spread in the @xmath2  masses found in our models suggests that the peak luminosity should be roughly similar in all ultra - stripped sne , although the lc rise time can vary depending on the ejecta mass @xcite . in our one - dimensional model",
    "the @xmath2  mass ejected depends on the mass cut , but @xcite obtained similar @xmath2  masses in their multi - dimensional explosion simulations .",
    "thus , the spectral signatures we find in this study for a particular progenitor model are likely to be generic for ultra - stripped sne .",
    "a possible major source of diversity in ultra - stripped sn properties that may be caused by differences in their progenitors is their sn spectral type , which is determined by the ejected helium mass . in the progenitor model we used in this study ,",
    "there are 0.03  @xmath15  of helium in an ejected mass of @xmath27 .",
    "although helium features are not expected to be observed significantly in our model and we expect the explosion to be a sn  ic ( section  [ sec : hefeatures ] ) , the helium mass as well as the ejecta mass can change depending on the initial binary configurations @xcite .",
    "many progenitors are expected to have a helium mass above the critical helium mass ( @xmath0 , @xcite ) required to observe optical helium features @xcite , and thus may be observed as sne  ib like sn  2010x .",
    "to summarize , the expected luminosity range of ultra - stripped sne is similar to that obtained with the model used in this paper .",
    "the diversity in sn ejecta masses caused by different progenitor systems could lead to diversity in the rise times of ultra - stripped sne .",
    "we indicate the expected location of ultra - stripped sne in the phase diagram of transients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : kulkarni ] .",
    "it is likely that there is a smooth transition between ultra - stripped sne and stripped - envelope sne . the classical type  ic sn  1994i , which had an ejecta mass of only 1  @xmath15(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be an example of a sn  ic located between typical stripped - envelope sne and ultra - stripped sne .",
    "also , the low - mass type  ic sn  2007gr @xcite may be an even more extreme case .          based on our spectral analysis , we have shown that sn  2005ek and some of the ca - rich gap transients , as well as sn  2010x , might be related to ultra - stripped sne .",
    "the event rate of rapidly - evolving sne including sn  2005ek , sn  2010x , and sn  2002bj are estimated to be at least 1 - 3 per cent of sne  ia @xcite .",
    "the total event rate of the ca - rich gap transients is estimated to be at least a few per cent of sne  ia @xcite . given that a part of the transients included to estimate the two event rates actually correspond to ultra - stripped sne , we can roughly estimate that the event rate for the ultra - stripped sne based on sn observations is at least a few per cent of sne  ia .",
    "because the volumetric rates of sne  ia and sne  ib / ic are similar ( e.g. , @xcite ) , ultra - stripped sn rates are presumed to be at least a few per cent of sne  ib / ic .",
    "this rate corresponds to roughly 1 per cent of all core - collapse sne including sne  ii @xcite and matches the rough event rate estimate by @xcite ( @xmath28 per cent of core - collapse sne ) .",
    "further observational and theoretical studies to better estimate the event rate of ultra - stripped sne are encouraged for their better comparison .      because ultra - stripped sne are presumed to lead to double - ns systems , but not all double ns systems merge within a hubble time , the observed rate of ultra - stripped sne is expected to be larger than the rate of double - ns mergers .",
    "furthermore , ultra - stripped sne may also originate in binary systems with a white dwarf or a black hole accretor @xcite .",
    "after the recent success in detecting gravitational wave signals from merging compact objects by advanced ligo @xcite , it is expected that gravitational waves from merging double - ns systems will be detected in the near future , with advanced ligo or other detectors like advanced virgo and kagra .",
    "thus , it will soon be possible to obtain ns merger rate constraints from gravitational wave observations .",
    "this should place a lower limit to the rate of ultra - stripped sne .",
    "comparing the rates of ultra - stripped sne and ns mergers , we will be able to test whether the ultra - stripped sn channel is actually the major path to form double - ns systems , and thus to constrain binary stellar evolution using gravitational waves .",
    "the current constraints on the ns merger rate from ligo is less than @xmath29 @xcite . assuming the galactic core - collapse sn rate of @xmath30 and ultra - stripped sn fraction of @xmath28 per cent in core - collapse sne",
    ", we obtain an expected galactic ultra - stripped sn rate of @xmath31 .",
    "if we adopt the milky way equivalent galaxy density of @xmath32 @xcite , we expect an ultra - stripped sn rate of @xmath33 . this is significantly lower than the current upper limit on the ns - ns merger rate from ligo .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the distribution of eccentricities in current observations of ns - ns binaries @xcite supports the idea that ultra - stripped sne are indeed the progenitors of the second sn in these systems , and that they often ( but not always ) result in small kicks .",
    "out of 12 ns - ns systems , 9 have an eccentricity of less than 0.3 .",
    "moreover , even relatively small ns kicks of @xmath34 can result in post - sn eccentricities of more than @xmath35 , depending on the orbital period ( tauris et al . in preparation ) .      while it has been argued that the descendants of ultra - stripped sne are often close pairs of nss in binaries , it is much more difficult to find direct observational evidence for the progenitors of ultra - stripped sne . arguably , a fraction of high - mass x - ray binaries currently containing a ns and an ob - star will eventually evolve into double ns systems .",
    "others will merge or become disrupted in the process .",
    "however , in between these two stages , the immediate progenitors of ultra - stripped stars would be found either as post - common envelope naked helium stars ( wolf - rayet stars ) or in an x - ray binary during the subsequent so - called case  bb roche - lobe overflow .",
    "however , these phases are short lasting ( especially the latter which is typically @xmath36 , @xcite ) and thus chances of detecting these systems are small , even though the helium star is rather luminous ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "one possible related observed system is cygnus x-3 which is a close binary system with a ns or bh and a wolf - rayet star , but the mass of the wolf - rayet star ( about 10  @xmath15 , @xcite ) is too high to correspond to an ultra - stripped sn progenitor .",
    "we have presented synthetic lcs and spectral properties of ultra - stripped sne .",
    "we evolved the ultra - stripped sn progenitor presented previously @xcite until core collapse , calculated its explosive nucleosynthesis , and then synthesized lcs and spectra .",
    "our ultra - stripped sne have explosion energies of @xmath38 and ejecta masses of @xmath39@xmath15 .",
    "explosive nucleosynthesis calculations show that they produce about @xmath40 of @xmath2 .",
    "we also found that ultra - stripped sne have rise times of @xmath5  days and their peak luminosity is @xmath41  mag or @xmath3 .",
    "several types of transients have been found that have rise times and peak luminosities similar to those expected for ultra - stripped sne .",
    "they show diverse spectral properties .",
    "we compared our synthetic spectra with those of rapidly - evolving transients showing lcs similar to those of our synthetic ultra - stripped sn lcs , and found that the spectra of sn2005ek , some of so - called ca - rich gap transients , and sn2010x match reasonably well our synthetic ultra - stripped sn spectra .",
    "not all ca - rich gap transients have similar properties to our ultra - stripped sne , indicating that this group of transients may include events with different origin .",
    "for example , the spectra of ptf10iuv are consistent with our ultra - stripped sn spectra , while those of sn  2005e are not .",
    "if all the transients above mentioned are actually from ultra - stripped sne , the event rate of ultra - stripped sne would be about one per cent of all stripped - envelope sne .",
    "it has been suggested that ultra - stripped sne may be a major evolutionary path to form double - ns systems which could merge within a hubble time and that double - ns systems left by ultra - stripped sne may dominate the population of merging double - ns systems which is expected to be observed by gw observatories @xcite .",
    "if this is true , we expect the ns merger rate to be comparable to or somewhat smaller than that of ultra - stripped sne .",
