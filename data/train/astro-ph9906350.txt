    "barnes &  evans ( 1976 ) showed that a tight relation exists between the visual surface brightness and the colour of giants .",
    "such a relation allows to determine the angular diameter and , if the distance is known , the radius of a star from photometric data alone ( lacy 1977 , dumm &  schild 1998 ) .",
    "lacy assumed that the barnes - evans relation derived for giants holds also for dwarfs , but this has never been actually proved .    for giants ,",
    "additional measurements of the angular diameters have become available in recent years ( dumm &  schild 1998 , dyck et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "angular diameters of dwarfs can so far not be measured directly , but can be derived from bolometric fluxes and temperatures or , more accurately , from flux scaling of model atmospheres to the low - resolution optical / ir overall spectral energy distributions .",
    "leggett et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter l96 ) have applied this method to 16 m - dwarfs using the advanced _ nextgen _ m - dwarf model atmospheres of hauschildt et al .",

    "1998 , hereafter bcah98 ; see the comparisons made in l96 and in beuermann et al .",
    "1998 , henceforth paper i ) .",
    "this convergence of theory and observation is generally regarded as a breakthrough and an important step towards a temperature and radius scale of stars on the lower main sequence , although there is still some concern about the remaining differences ( e.g. clemens et al . 1998 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use the results of l96 to derive the surface brightness of m - dwarfs .",
    "we then show that the visual surface brightness vs. cousins @xmath1 relationships for m - dwarfs differs from that of m - giants in a colour - dependent way and find a close agreement between observationally determined and theoretically predicted gravity dependencies ( bcah98 , alibert et al .",
    "1999 , hauschildt et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we , furthermore , show that m - dwarfs display a metallicity dependence of the surface brightness in the infrared @xmath0-band which also agrees with that predicted .",
    "the good agreement between theory and observation increases our confidence in the derived barnes - evans relations and the implied radius scale of m - dwarfs .",
    "barnes &  evans ( 1976 ) defined the surface brightness as + 0.25log(4@xmath2 ) , where @xmath3= 4.75 is the bolometic magnitude of the sun , @xmath4erg@xmath5s@xmath6 is the solar constant , and @xmath7 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . ]",

    "( 1 ) can be cast into the form ( e.g. bailey 1981 ) @xmath14        figure 1 compares the visual surface brightness vs. cousins @xmath1   relationships for late - type giants and dwarfs .",
    "the giant sample includes 28 stars from dumm & schild ( 1998 ) with spectral types m0 to m7 ( @xmath15@xmath1@xmath16 ) and nine non - variable k - giants from dyck et al .",
    "most of the stars are of luminosity class iii with a few of class ii .",
    "the @xmath17 magnitudes and cousins @xmath1 values were taken from the on - line version of the hipparcos catalogue ( entries h5 and h40 ) , the angular diameters are from dumm &  schild ( 1998 ) and dyck et al .",
    "( 1998 , and private communication ) .",
    "most of the giants in the sample are located within the local bubble where the density of atomic hydrogen is low ( diamond et al .",
    "1995 , thomas & beuermann 1998 ) . inside the bubble , reddening is usually small and the standard reddening corrections based on distance and latitude ( e.g. fouqu & gieren 1997 ) are of limited use .",
    "we opted not to apply reddening corrections , therefore .",
    "there may be a problem , however , with circumstellar absorption in some of the stars of latest spectral type ( see e.g. the comments in dumm & schild 1998 ) .",
    "we excluded one star from the giant sample , @xmath18ser , which leaves us with 27 stars .",
    "for illustrative purposes , we show in the reddening path for a standard interstellar absorption of @xmath19 with @xmath20 ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , but expect that none of the giants shows this much absorption . since most of the m - giants are more or less variable , errors due to the non - simultaneity of the brightness and angular diameter measurements probably dominate the observed scatter in @xmath21 .",
    "the error bars are , therefore , determined by quadratically adding the variability amplitude ( 1/2 of the difference in fields h50 and h49 in the hipparcos catalogue ) , a minimum uncertainty in the @xmath17-magnitude , taken to be 0.02 mag , and the error in 5log@xmath11 .",
    "the standard error in @xmath1 is taken from entry h41 of the hipparcos catalogue . a linear fit for the 27 m - giants yields @xmath22 which agrees with the fit of dumm &  schild ( 1998 , their eq .",
    "5 ) within the 1@xmath7 errors .",
    "the scatter in the giant data is a source of concern for the dwarf - giant comparison .",
    "we can not exclude that this comparison is affected by remaining systematic errors in the giant data , like selection effects , variability , and circumstellar reddening , which are difficult to estimate .",
    "it is comforting , though , that eq . ( 3 ) is consistent with the red section of the original relation of barnes &  evans ( 1976 ) which was given as a function of johnson @xmath23 .",
    "our result is also consistent with the @xmath21 vs. relations for cepheids , field giants and field supergiants discussed by fouqu & gieren ( 1997 ) .",
    "using simbad nitudes for 16 of our m - giants , we obtain @xmath24 which is valid for @xmath25@xmath26 and agrees with the red part of the fouqu & gieren relation ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) .    for k - giants , the relation in fig . 1 steepens .",
    "this change of slope was already noted by barnes & evans ( 1976 ) and barnes et al .",
    "( 1977 ) who also showed that there is no difference in the surface brightness of giants and dwarfs for stars of spectral types b  g and found the sun to fall on the giant relation . tying the fit to the sun at , @xmath21=4.85 ,",
    "we obtain for @xmath1@xmath27 .",
    "all barnes - evans type relations for giants suggest that the slope of the relation changes near the transition from k to m - stars . in summary , the results for",
    "giants presented here coincide closely with those of other authors .    the dwarf data in fig .",
    "1 include eight young disk ( yd ) m - dwarfs from l96 and the yd eclipsing binary yy gem of spectral type m1+m1 .",
    "the angular diameters and effective temperatures @xmath28 were derived by l96 from flux fitting of the hauschildt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) _ nextgen _ model atmospheres to the observed low - resolution optical / ir spectra .",
    "l96 consider the angular diameters obtained by this approach to be less fallible to errors in @xmath28 than those derived from the observational bolometric magnitude and @xmath28 .",
    "they quote an error of 2% in the derived angular diameters .",
    "an additional uncertainty in the radii may , however , arise from errors in the flux fitting procedure .",
    "the integrated luminosities of the best - fit models quoted by l96 tend to fall below the observed luminosity , i.e. @xmath29@xmath30 ) + @xmath3  @xmath31  @xmath29 , with @xmath13 and @xmath28 as derived by l96 and the @xmath31 sign implying `` fainter than '' .",
    "for the eight l96 yd stars , the flux deficiency averages relative to @xmath29  = @xmath32  + @xmath33 , with @xmath33 the visual bolometric correction as given by l96 ( their tab .",
    "6 ) , and relative to @xmath29  = @xmath34  + @xmath35 , with the bolometric correction in the @xmath0-band from tinney et al . ( 1993 ) . while it is well known that bolometric magnitudes are uncertain by as much as 0.10 mag ( see e.g. the discussion in l96 and their fig .",
    "7 ) , the amount of the flux deficiency suggests that either the temperatures of l96 are low by @xmath36% , their radii by , or both by correspondingly smaller percentages .",
    "accepting the radii implies that the temperatures of the eight yd stars are on the average too low by 90k which is well within the temperature errors , whereas accepting the temperatures leads to angular diameters ( not radii which include the parallax errors ) outside the quoted range .",
    "we assume , therefore , that the radii are basically correct and proceed to use them for calibrating our barnes - evans relation for dwarfs .",
    "the possible @xmath37% systematic uncertainty in the angular diameters corresponds to an uncertainty of 0.13 in @xmath21 which may affect the absolute level of @xmath21 but probably not the slope of the @xmath21(@xmath1 ) relation .",
    "the l96 yd dwarfs are well observed with an error in @xmath1 less than @xmath38 . both error bars , in @xmath21 and @xmath1 , are of the size of the dwarf data points in fig . 1 .",
    "finally , the mean angular diameter of the two components of yy gem was calculated from their observed radii ( leung &  schneider 1978 ) and the hipparcos parallax of 63.2mas .",
    "note that there is no systematic difference between the surface brightness of yy gem and that established for yd dwarfs by the radius scale of l96 .",
    "a linear fit to the data in , i.e. the eight yd dwarfs from l96 and to yy gem , yields @xmath39 which is valid for @xmath1@xmath40 .",
    "comparison of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 5 ) shows that there is a difference in slope of @xmath41 which is significant at the @xmath42 level .",
    "the absolute levels of the giant and dwarf fits suggest that the visual surface brightness of early m - dwarfs is slightly higher than that of m - giants , reaching a separation of @xmath43mag at spectral type k7/m0 ( @xmath1 = 1.65 ) . since there are no equally reliable radii for k - dwarfs",
    ", the extension to @xmath1@xmath44 is not covered .",
    "there is no difference in the surface brightness of giants and dwarfs for stars of spectral types b  g ( barnes & evans 1976 , barnes et al .",
    "1977 ) , however , which suggests that the observational dwarf relation in fig . 1",
    "should connect to the sun , that the dwarf / giant difference reaches a maximum for late k and early m stars , and that the break in the @xmath21(@xmath1 ) relation near @xmath1@xmath45 is less pronounced for dwarfs than for giants .",
    "this observation suggests the presence of gravity effects in the surface brightness vs. colour relation .",
    "figure 1 also compares the observational results with the predictions of recent theoretical work for late - type giants ( alibert et al .",
    "1999 , hauschildt et al . in preparation ) and late - type dwarfs ( bcah98 ) , both of solar composition .",
    "the @xmath21(@xmath1 ) relationship predicted for solar - metallicity zams dwarfs with masses from 1.2@xmath46 down to 0.075@xmath46 is shown as solid curve ( for clarity shifted downward by two units ) . the corresponding relationship for giants ( dashed curve )",
    "is represented by the post main sequence evolutionary track of a 12@xmath46 star , evolved until central carbon ignition .",
    "details of the calculations can be found in the recent work of alibert et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on cepheids which shows a generally good agreement between models and recent observations in period  magnitude and period  radius diagrams .",
    "we note that tracks from 4@xmath46 to 12@xmath46 are very similar in the @xmath21 vs. @xmath1 diagram .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of fouqu & gieren ( 1997 ) , who find that giant and supergiant surface brightness relations are indistinguishable .",
    "therefore , the 12@xmath46 track shown in fig . 1 is representative of the @xmath21(@xmath1 ) relationship expected for giant and supergiants , with gravities log@xmath47 and effective temperatures @xmath28 = @xmath48k .",
    "the differences in the slopes and normalizations of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 5 ) as well as the different strengths of the break for giants and dwarfs at the k / m transition ( @xmath1=1.65 ) agree quantitatively with those predicted by the stellar models . for the range in @xmath1 covered here , the theoretical relationships for giants and dwarfs reach a maximum separation of @xmath49@xmath21 = 0.35 mag at @xmath1=1.65 , very similar to the observed difference of 0.30mag from eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "since the giant @xmath21 is based on observed angular diameters and we consider the theoretical prediction of the difference in @xmath21 reliable , the dwarf @xmath21 and , hence , the dwarf radius scale can not be seriously in error either .",
    "for an early m - star of given @xmath32 , a difference in @xmath21 for giants and dwarfs of @xmath49@xmath21 = 0.30 mag corresponds to a difference in radius of 15% .",
    "i.e. , if the giant calibration were used for dwarfs , the derived radii at ( spectral type k7 ) would be 15% too large .    for later spectral types ,",
    "the difference becomes smaller and even reverses sign near @xmath1@xmath50 , or spectral type m4.5 .",
    "models for giants of still later spectral type ( @xmath28@xmath51k ) are not yet available and the comparison between obervation and theory is restricted to spectral types earlier than m4 .",
    "a quantitative comparison of the absolute values of @xmath21 is limited by the fact that the theoretical @xmath17-magnitudes of m - stars calculated with the most recent models are still somewhat too bright and the colours involving @xmath17 too blue ( see also fig . 2b which shows the corresponding effect in the colour ) .",
    "this remaining error in the theory is suspected to be due to uncertainties in the molecular absorption coefficients for solar - metallicity stars in the visual passband ( bcah98 ) .",
    "it causes the slopes of the @xmath21(@xmath1 ) relations of both m - giants and m - dwarfs at @xmath1@xmath52 to be too steep , but should , to a first approximation , not affect the ordinate _ difference _ of the two curves which measures the gravity effect . since the error in the theoretical @xmath17-magnitudes of late - type stars with near - solar metallicity reaches about 0.6 mag",
    "( see fig .",
    "3b ) the corrected theoretical crossover between the @xmath21(@xmath1 ) relations of giants and dwarfs occurs at @xmath1@xmath53 rather than @xmath1@xmath54 , which is just as observed .    while our results show that a slight gravity effect in the @xmath21(@xmath1 ) relation is present , the calibrations of eqs .",

    "this _ approximate _",
    "equality is the observational and theoretical basis for lacy s ( 1977 ) approach to determine the radii of late - type dwarfs from the barnes - evans relation for giants .",
    "in addition to gravity , metallicity affects the surface brightness at a given colour .",
    "given the steepness of the @xmath21(@xmath1 ) relation , however , the dependence of the observational data on metallicity is easily obliterated by errors in @xmath1 .",
    "it is more readily detectable in the infrared @xmath0-band because @xmath55 is a much shallower function of colour .",

    "this subdivision can be interpreted in terms of different metallicity if age is not an influencing factor .",

    "compared with lacy s results , our radii are smaller by up to @xmath96% .",
    "fig.4 shows that there is a systematic trend for the difference between lacy s radii and those determined by l96 or , for the addtional stars , from our barnes - evans type relations @xmath55 ( ) . very similar pictures obtain for the radii derived from the barnes - evans type relation @xmath55(@xmath58 ) ( tab .",

    "3 , column 10 , both not shown ) . the deviation of lacy s from our radii assumes a maximum at spectral type k7 and vanishes for early k and for late m dwarfs .",
    "much of this is due to the different surface brightness calibrations for giants ( used by lacy ) and dwarfs ( used here ) which reach a maximum separation at @xmath1 @xmath97 , @xmath98 , or spectral class k7 ( fig .",
    "the remainder is due to differences in the individual giant relations used by lacy ( barnes & evans 1976 ) and by us ( eq . 3 and dumm & schild 1997 ) .",
    "lacy discussed a deviation of similar magnitude and colour - dependence between the surface brightness of giants and the theoretical zams dwarf models of copeland et al .",
    "he interpreted it as being entirely due to inadequacies of the models .",
    "we now know that ( i ) the surface brightness of mid - k to mid - m dwarfs is , in fact , higher than that of giants of the same colour and ( ii ) the recent dwarf models ( bcah98 ) predict somewhat larger radii than the early models which reduces the discrepancy noted by lacy ( 1977 ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the systematic errors in our radius calibration which is tied to the observational results of l96 and to the theoretical predictions of bcah98 .",
    "our radius scale for stars of near - solar metallicity is based on the results of l96 which may still be in error by some @xmath99% or 0.03 in log@xmath13 ( radii too small , see sect .",
    "the difference of this radius scale to the bcah [ m / h]=0 model is @xmath100% .",
    "clemens et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , on the other hand , quote radii for stars later than m2 _ at given mass _ which are larger than those predicted by bcah98 by @xmath10120% .",
    "part of this discrepancy may be due to remaining uncertainties in the bolometric corrections ( sect .",
    "2 ) and part to the transformations used by them .",
    "clemens et al .",
    "adopt the @xmath29 scale and the temperature scale of l96 to deduce radii which are higher by @xmath102% than those quoted by l96 .",
    "they employ the _ mean observational _",
    "@xmath32(@xmath103 ) relation of henry & mccarthy ( 1993 ) in order to convert absolute visual magnitudes @xmath32 to masses @xmath103 . for @xmath104@xmath46 ,",
    "this relation presently relies on 10 stars only ( henry et al .",
    "it shows substantial scatter which may be caused by a spread in ages and metallicity and/or still by the inclusion of erroneous masses .",
    "the masses of the yd binary wolf424 ( @xmath105 and @xmath106@xmath46 ) were recently re - determined with the _ hst _ fine guidance sensors ( torres et al . 1999 ) and agree perfectly with the predictions of bcah98 .",
    "we expect that a better definition of the mass  radius relation will become available soon ( henry et al .",
    "1999 ) and allow the remaining discrepancies to be resolved .",
    "we conclude that the effects of gravity on the visual surface brightness of m - giants and m - dwarfs as well as the effects of metallicity on the surface brightness of m - dwarfs are discernible in the data and agree quantitatively with the predictions of recent stellar models ( alibert et al . 1999 ,",
    "hauschildt et al . in preparation ,",
    "the surface brightness values of and dwarfs agree for spectral types earlier than @xmath101k2 and later than @xmath101m5 and reach a maximum separation at spectral type k7 .",
    "although small , this difference must be taken into account when estimating dwarf radii by the surface brightness method .",
    "we present improved barnes - evans type relations which allow to determine the radii of late - type giants and dwarfs of known distances with a remaining systematic uncertainty of @xmath99% .",
    "our calibration is based on the m - dwarf radii determined by l96 from fits of the _ nextgen _ model atmospheres of hauschildt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to the observed spectra of these stars .",
    "while these radii are not purely observational , the internal consistency of atmosphere calculations , stellar models , and observation has reached a high degree of excellency .",
